Appearing for her third supporting actress nod for eventual best picture winner The Shape of Water, the actress and children\u2019s-book author was styled by sister team Wendi and Nicole in an ethereal green gown that evoked the flowing depths of the sea.\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images)\n\nAs we\u2019ve learned from several female celebs who don\u2019t fit the typical Hollywood starlet mold\u2014including being over 40 and not a sample size\u2014it can sometimes be a struggle to find red-carpet-worthy gowns. Christian Siriano and Tadashi Shoji have both become reliable industry sources for all-inclusive glamour, but Spencer nailed her look Sunday night courtesy of one of our fashion faves, Brandon Maxwell (who also dressed best actress winner Alison Janney and our hilarious homegirl Tiffany Haddish for the Vanity Fair after-party Sunday night). In a lovely Instagram post, Maxwell wrote:\n\nI am very proud, with my team, to have dressed Best Supporting Actress nominee @octaviaspencer in a custom emerald green satin faced organza gown for Tonight\u2019s 90th Annual Academy Awards. Octavia makes history tonight with her third nomination, and we are beyond honored to be a part of her special moment.\n\nWhat we loved about this dress is how well the belted silhouette and full, flowing skirt highlighted Spencer\u2019s curvy figure, as well as the deep emerald green, which played to perfection against her brown skin\u2014which we were thrilled to see more of on display. But our favorite aspect by far was the off-the-shoulder neckline, which framed her beautiful face and shoulders, which were grazed by a wavy bob, styled by celebrity hairstylist and groomer David Stanwell.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStanwell began working with Spencer five years ago while at the Cannes Film Festival to promote Fruitvale Station. He says he hit it off with the acclaimed actress the moment they met, telling The Glow Up: \u201cShe has a great sense of humor, and we always have a fun time together. She is professional, and all those elements make for a good work environment.\u201d\n\nThis awards season, Spencer\u2019s hair\u2014which Stanwell tells us is naturally curly and pressed out\u2014has consistently looked stunning, with the actress frequently rocking loose waves to accent her array of red-carpet looks. Stanwell tells us:\n\nOctavia loves curls in the hair\u2014big, medium, and sometimes smaller! We always opt for curls going away from [the] face, and we alternate the tightness depending upon the size of the curling iron. The only time we don\u2019t curl is if we do a slicked-back look with a bun or ponytail. As most award shows are long, we like to stick to simple and practical looks, yet still with a glamorous edge without being too fussy. Our influence always comes from classic and elegant so we always end up in that wheelhouse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Tristan Fewings (Getty Images)\n\nWhile Stanwell is always willing to gently push his star client to try something new and different, he\u2019s also very respectful of her comfort zone and happiness on the red carpet. But when Stanwell saw a sketch of Spencer\u2019s 2018 Oscar gown, he was inspired to take her look shorter to keep the shoulders bare, telling us:\n\nOctavia had sent me the sketch of her dress [last] week, which helped spark my inspiration for [Sunday night\u2019s] look. Instantly, I knew I wanted to do a side part, so that one side was off the shoulder to compliment her dress and jewelry. Octavia liked the idea of a curl, but not too brushed out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStanwell says his secret to keeping Spencer\u2019s hair looking glamorous and healthy is simpler\u2014and far less expensive\u2014than one might think. For Spencer, he\u2019s been relying on a variety of Dove hair products, which, in his words, \u201c[have] helped with that shine and healthy glow that we all want for our hair.\u201d\n\nWe were curious, so he graciously gave The Glow Up a how-to on Spencer\u2019s wavy Oscars bob:\n\n\u201cI started prepping the hair by mixing Dove Style + Care Smooth & Shine Heat Protection Spray and a dollop of Dove Absolute Curls Supreme Cr\u00e8me Serum together to moisturize her hair before applying any heat.\n\n\u201cUsing a large, round brush, I blow-dried her hair to create the desired face-framing shape. We decided on taking the hair shorter [for the night], so after I blow-dried it, I made a deep side part to add more definition to the look.\n\n\u201cAfter I finished blow-drying the hair, I went through it with a 1-inch curling iron to create glamorous, defined waves by twisting the hair toward her face.\n\n\u201cWhile the hair was cooling, I sprayed Dove Style + Care Compressed Micro Mist Flexible Hold Hairspray to give it that extra hold before running my hands through to break up the curls. [Pro tip: Waiting until the hair is cool enough to run one\u2019s fingers through it gives it a fabulous curl that will last all night long.]\n\n\u201cAfter shaping the hair and dressing it around her face, I tucked the curls on the right side of her face behind her ear to give it a romantic feel and show off her jewelry. To finish, I sprayed Dove Style + Care Compressed Micro Mist Flexible Hold Hairspray again throughout the hair to give it a boost of shine.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe have to give credit to Stanwell and Spencer\u2019s entire glam squad for giving one of our screen queens the Cinderella moment she so richly deserved. It\u2019s always exciting to see a star\u2019s style evolve, and while Spencer isn\u2019t known for glamorous roles, we\u2019re hoping to see these gorgeous, age-appropriate (and subtly sexy!) red-carpet moments continue for her.

But, Get Out is a lot less comforting, which is probably why it didn\u2019t win Best Picture last night.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s safety in distance. That\u2019s one of the things you realize when surveying creative work that touches on prejudice in American society. Recent Oscar-nominated films about the black experience like Malcolm X, 12 Years a Slave, or Selma have all had the buffer of decades or centuries. They still hold up a mirror that reflects a history of institutionalized racism but there\u2019s a thick layer of dust covering the reflected image, letting viewers say \u201cThat only kinda looks like us; things have gotten better.\u201d\n\nThe Shape of Water has that same dust on it. The period-piece stylings in Guillermo del Toro\u2019s movie are meant to invoke the timeframe when B-movie monster features were all the rage. That element also ties in neatly to the fact that blatant racism and sexism ran rampant during the Cold War era. Nothing about the movie\u2019s lush romanticism or softly lit happy ending makes the viewer think about the plight of society\u2019s outsiders in the present day.\n\nBecause it\u2019s in the here-and-now, Get Out doesn\u2019t offer the easy dodge of distance. Its central plot mechanic calls on a history of exploitation and injustice that\u2019s continuing to happen. Lured in by white people he thought he could trust, Chris gets treated like a resource: a body to be hollowed out and a soul to be discarded. Niceties are said about his talent but doors aren\u2019t opened; instead, the bidders at the Armitages\u2019 backyard auction want to possess Chris\u2019 skills for themselves rather than have him create his own successes.\n\nLook, I\u2019m glad that Get Out and The Shape of Water won their respective awards last night. It\u2019s not insignificant that The Shape of Water is the first genre movie to win Best Picture since 2004, but Peele\u2019s win for Best Original Screenplay feels like a safe consolation prize, something big enough to be meaningful but not heavy with the ultimate weight of Best Picture. When you factor in some of the attitudes and dismissiveness that preceded Sunday night\u2019s envelope-opening, it\u2019s not hard to see that this another case of Hollywood expecting a pat on the back for a half-measure.", "keywords": ["racism", "best", "thats", "shape", "didnt", "water", "outsiders", "guts", "things", "movie", "picture", "academy", "win"], "polarity": 0.2588293650793651, "subjectivity": 0.4331349206349207},

Now in his 10th year as head of his own label, the most successful graduate of the Project Runway franchise has built his success on dressing women of all colors, shapes and sizes and fully diversifying his runway presentations into inspirational, aspirational and attainable symbols of beauty and style.\n\nThough Siriano himself is as petite as they come, he knows that the fashion struggle is real for people whose proportions, personalities or orientations are not the \u201cnorm\u201d on the retail floor or red carpet. Maybe that\u2019s why he\u2019s been so nimble at dressing die-hard fans like EGOT Whoopi Goldberg, who sat front-row at his show Saturday, along with rap \u201cit\u201d girl Cardi B, dressed head to toe in a money-green suit with a white mink stole tossed over her shoulder for good measure. Both were there to applaud the 10th year of his superluxe ready-to-wear collection.\n\nBut Siriano\u2019s work just isn\u2019t for the rich and famous; we can all walk in designer shoes from the collection he personally designs for Payless, or slide into a sheath from his ongoing collaboration with plus-size retailer Lane Bryant.

He\u2019s a gifted filmmaker, and I think this is his first foray into fish fucking.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis actually sounds like quite an intriguing and ambitious film.\n\nI agree!

After years of modeling, it wasn\u2019t an unfamiliar scenario, but this was different. I wasn\u2019t being fit for a retailer\u2019s catalog or campaign, but for one of the biggest nights of my life. I was fitting for the Grammys, as a first-time nominee.\n\nMy trusty stylist had managed to procure samples from a few known designers\u2014difficult for an unknown artist\u2014but would they fit? At the time, because of a restrictive diet and rigorous daily gym habit, I was a size 6 (a lifestyle choice that ran contrary to my ongoing career as a plus-size model). It was the smallest I\u2019d ever be as an adult. But even at my smallest, after years spent in the modeling industry, I also knew that my average-black-girl proportions\u2014thick thighs, wide hips and a voluptuousness that wouldn\u2019t be exercised into submission\u2014weren\u2019t an ideal fit for high fashion.\n\nNearly eight years later, my diet is far less strict, and my steadfast hourglass has returned to a luscious 12-14. But when Leslie Jones was recently denied by multiple designers while searching for a dress for her Ghostbusters premiere, I intimately felt her pain. Like Leslie, I was forced to have an outfit custom-made because even the samples I managed to fit were sadly devoid of personality and often ill-fitting.\n\nNo amount of success or self-care could shield either of us from the humiliating fact that when it came to high fashion, our size somehow made us unworthy of inclusion. Instead, our bodies were somehow expected to offer an apology to an industry that refused to accommodate us instead of recognizing each and every body\u2019s right to look and feel good.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs it turns out, Leslie and I weren\u2019t alone in taking matters into our own hands. After decades spent watching designers largely ignore even their own body types in their collections (see Anna Sui and the formerly full Donna Karan, among others), it\u2019s no surprise that models and celebrities alike have begun to capitalize on a market that remains underserved even while the press praises a more body-positive climate. For lack of better options, Ashley Graham, Melissa McCarthy and, soon, Orange Is the New Black\u2019s Dascha Polanco\u2014who just took body positivity to new heights by attending a runway show in a thigh-baring bodysuit\u2014are among those channeling their fame, experience and frustration into creating fashion that flatters figures like their own.\n\nBut what of the established designers, who have long possessed the resources and influence to be more inclusive? The party line is that fuller figures are more difficult to design for, but occasionally, the truth is far more brutal: They are simply not interested. We not only don\u2019t fit their clothes; we don\u2019t fit their brand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs I write this, New York Fall Fashion Week is in full swing. Early in my career, walking the runway for pioneering retailer Lane Bryant or for a smattering of department store events were among the rare opportunities offered full-figured models during NYFFW. But this year, Christian Siriano\u2014who both famously came to Leslie Jones\u2019 rescue and created his own capsule collection for Lane Bryant\u2014did the unthinkable: He cast several plus-size models in his fall presentation, with neither fanfare nor kitsch.\n\n\u201cI am just trying to show you that you can do it, you can celebrate everyone. \u2026 The clothes looked just as amazing on [the plus models] as everyone else,\u201d he noted in an interview with Refinery29.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile perhaps the most visible, Siriano isn\u2019t the only designer featuring a diversity of bodies on the runway this season. Designer Tracy Reese upped her #BlackGirlMagic quotient by announcing that she\u2019ll now offer at least a portion of her line in extended sizes (up to a size 18/2X), and backed it up by casting a range of people of varying ages and sizes in her show. Legendary designer Byron Lars celebrated the 25th year of his eponymous label (now available in sizes 0-22) with a show themed \u201cExclusive Inclusion,\u201d featuring models and personalities up to a size 18. And sportswear designer Chromat continued a commitment to diverse presentations by featuring not only a variety of body types but also differently abled and transgender models.\n\nSo, yes, the body-positive movement is progressing, and obviously I\u2019m here for it, having invested my career in helping to forward the narrative. But are we really expected to pat designers on the back for acknowledging the obvious: that not only bigger bodies but bigger dollars await them on the other side of inclusion? And for black and brown women in particular, is it fair to ask us to ignore the fact that the bodies the fashion industry consistently seems so incapable of acknowledging most often resemble our own, and our mothers\u2019, sisters\u2019 and friends\u2019?\n\nNo one needs to tell any marginalized group how much representation matters. Being represented honestly and positively in the public perception is something we fight for every day. For the 100 million plus-size women in America alone, our exclusion from the aspirational market that is high fashion is nothing short of defeminizing. Diversity of bodies on the catwalk is a beginning, but without a broader diversity of options in the stores, it\u2019s an empty gesture at best.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Project Runway mentor Tim Gunn notes in an op-ed for the Washington Post, the fashion industry\u2019s dismissal of bigger body types is not only a \u201cdisgrace\u201d but also downright delusional. He states, \u201c[T]his is now the shape of women in this nation, and designers need to wrap their minds around it.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s right. But as a black woman who\u2019s spent the last two decades of my life advocating for respect and representation not only for my race and gender but also the particular body I inhabit, the words that most often come to mind are instead Sojourner\u2019s.\n\nAfter all, \u201cain\u2019t I a woman?\u201d\n\nMaiysha Kai is a Grammy-nominated singer-songwriter, fashion model, devoted auntie and Brooklyn, N.Y.-based, single black bombshell who recently strutted into her 40s.

But, Get Out is a lot less comforting, which is probably why it didn\u2019t win Best Picture last night.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s safety in distance. That\u2019s one of the things you realize when surveying creative work that touches on prejudice in American society. Recent Oscar-nominated films about the black experience like Malcolm X, 12 Years a Slave, or Selma have all had the buffer of decades or centuries. They still hold up a mirror that reflects a history of institutionalized racism but there\u2019s a thick layer of dust covering the reflected image, letting viewers say \u201cThat only kinda looks like us; things have gotten better.\u201d\n\nThe Shape of Water has that same dust on it. The period-piece stylings in Guillermo del Toro\u2019s movie are meant to invoke the timeframe when B-movie monster features were all the rage. That element also ties in neatly to the fact that blatant racism and sexism ran rampant during the Cold War era. Nothing about the movie\u2019s lush romanticism or softly lit happy ending makes the viewer think about the plight of society\u2019s outsiders in the present day.\n\nBecause it\u2019s in the here-and-now, Get Out doesn\u2019t offer the easy dodge of distance. Its central plot mechanic calls on a history of exploitation and injustice that\u2019s continuing to happen. Lured in by white people he thought he could trust, Chris gets treated like a resource: a body to be hollowed out and a soul to be discarded. Niceties are said about his talent but doors aren\u2019t opened; instead, the bidders at the Armitages\u2019 backyard auction want to possess Chris\u2019 skills for themselves rather than have him create his own successes.\n\nLook, I\u2019m glad that Get Out and The Shape of Water won their respective awards last night. It\u2019s not insignificant that The Shape of Water is the first genre movie to win Best Picture since 2004, but Peele\u2019s win for Best Original Screenplay feels like a safe consolation prize, something big enough to be meaningful but not heavy with the ultimate weight of Best Picture. When you factor in some of the attitudes and dismissiveness that preceded Sunday night\u2019s envelope-opening, it\u2019s not hard to see that this another case of Hollywood expecting a pat on the back for a half-measure.", "keywords": ["racism", "best", "thats", "shape", "didnt", "water", "outsiders", "guts", "things", "movie", "picture", "academy", "win"], "polarity": 0.2588293650793651, "subjectivity": 0.4331349206349207},

Appearing for her third supporting actress nod for eventual best picture winner The Shape of Water, the actress and children\u2019s-book author was styled by sister team Wendi and Nicole in an ethereal green gown that evoked the flowing depths of the sea.\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images)\n\nAs we\u2019ve learned from several female celebs who don\u2019t fit the typical Hollywood starlet mold\u2014including being over 40 and not a sample size\u2014it can sometimes be a struggle to find red-carpet-worthy gowns. Christian Siriano and Tadashi Shoji have both become reliable industry sources for all-inclusive glamour, but Spencer nailed her look Sunday night courtesy of one of our fashion faves, Brandon Maxwell (who also dressed best actress winner Alison Janney and our hilarious homegirl Tiffany Haddish for the Vanity Fair after-party Sunday night). In a lovely Instagram post, Maxwell wrote:\n\nI am very proud, with my team, to have dressed Best Supporting Actress nominee @octaviaspencer in a custom emerald green satin faced organza gown for Tonight\u2019s 90th Annual Academy Awards. Octavia makes history tonight with her third nomination, and we are beyond honored to be a part of her special moment.\n\nWhat we loved about this dress is how well the belted silhouette and full, flowing skirt highlighted Spencer\u2019s curvy figure, as well as the deep emerald green, which played to perfection against her brown skin\u2014which we were thrilled to see more of on display. But our favorite aspect by far was the off-the-shoulder neckline, which framed her beautiful face and shoulders, which were grazed by a wavy bob, styled by celebrity hairstylist and groomer David Stanwell.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStanwell began working with Spencer five years ago while at the Cannes Film Festival to promote Fruitvale Station. He says he hit it off with the acclaimed actress the moment they met, telling The Glow Up: \u201cShe has a great sense of humor, and we always have a fun time together. She is professional, and all those elements make for a good work environment.\u201d\n\nThis awards season, Spencer\u2019s hair\u2014which Stanwell tells us is naturally curly and pressed out\u2014has consistently looked stunning, with the actress frequently rocking loose waves to accent her array of red-carpet looks. Stanwell tells us:\n\nOctavia loves curls in the hair\u2014big, medium, and sometimes smaller! We always opt for curls going away from [the] face, and we alternate the tightness depending upon the size of the curling iron. The only time we don\u2019t curl is if we do a slicked-back look with a bun or ponytail. As most award shows are long, we like to stick to simple and practical looks, yet still with a glamorous edge without being too fussy. Our influence always comes from classic and elegant so we always end up in that wheelhouse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Tristan Fewings (Getty Images)\n\nWhile Stanwell is always willing to gently push his star client to try something new and different, he\u2019s also very respectful of her comfort zone and happiness on the red carpet. But when Stanwell saw a sketch of Spencer\u2019s 2018 Oscar gown, he was inspired to take her look shorter to keep the shoulders bare, telling us:\n\nOctavia had sent me the sketch of her dress [last] week, which helped spark my inspiration for [Sunday night\u2019s] look. Instantly, I knew I wanted to do a side part, so that one side was off the shoulder to compliment her dress and jewelry. Octavia liked the idea of a curl, but not too brushed out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStanwell says his secret to keeping Spencer\u2019s hair looking glamorous and healthy is simpler\u2014and far less expensive\u2014than one might think. For Spencer, he\u2019s been relying on a variety of Dove hair products, which, in his words, \u201c[have] helped with that shine and healthy glow that we all want for our hair.\u201d\n\nWe were curious, so he graciously gave The Glow Up a how-to on Spencer\u2019s wavy Oscars bob:\n\n\u201cI started prepping the hair by mixing Dove Style + Care Smooth & Shine Heat Protection Spray and a dollop of Dove Absolute Curls Supreme Cr\u00e8me Serum together to moisturize her hair before applying any heat.\n\n\u201cUsing a large, round brush, I blow-dried her hair to create the desired face-framing shape. We decided on taking the hair shorter [for the night], so after I blow-dried it, I made a deep side part to add more definition to the look.\n\n\u201cAfter I finished blow-drying the hair, I went through it with a 1-inch curling iron to create glamorous, defined waves by twisting the hair toward her face.\n\n\u201cWhile the hair was cooling, I sprayed Dove Style + Care Compressed Micro Mist Flexible Hold Hairspray to give it that extra hold before running my hands through to break up the curls. [Pro tip: Waiting until the hair is cool enough to run one\u2019s fingers through it gives it a fabulous curl that will last all night long.]\n\n\u201cAfter shaping the hair and dressing it around her face, I tucked the curls on the right side of her face behind her ear to give it a romantic feel and show off her jewelry. To finish, I sprayed Dove Style + Care Compressed Micro Mist Flexible Hold Hairspray again throughout the hair to give it a boost of shine.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe have to give credit to Stanwell and Spencer\u2019s entire glam squad for giving one of our screen queens the Cinderella moment she so richly deserved. It\u2019s always exciting to see a star\u2019s style evolve, and while Spencer isn\u2019t known for glamorous roles, we\u2019re hoping to see these gorgeous, age-appropriate (and subtly sexy!) red-carpet moments continue for her.

A spectrum of vibrant fabrics are stacked to the ceiling, while dress forms stand half-draped in fabric, soon to join the rack of garments hanging along one full wall. In a corner beneath dozens of spools of thread, two industrial sewing machines sit lit and ready to turn out more of designer Whitney Mero\u2019s coveted creations.\n\n\n\nMero created the label over two decades ago; when asked for the origin story, she tossed back her trademark halo of tangled golden curls in laughter: \u201cThere\u2019s a respectable version, and there\u2019s a messy version. Which would you like to hear?\u201d Of course, The Glow Up wanted to hear both.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been shapely\u2014even as a child, I had a shape that was challenging for my parents to shop for,\u201d she shared. \u201cAnd as a result of that challenge, they put me in very ugly clothes. ... How do you dress a 12-year-old shaped like a grown person?\u201d\n\nAn adolescent Mero took matters into her own hands, getting an after-school job to fund her own clothing budget, shopping at thrift stores and then redesigning her finds into fresh styles. By her junior year in high school, she was making prom dresses for classmates when an older boyfriend suggested that she turn her talent into a business. The prospect was daunting but exciting:\n\nI remember taking a trip to Buffalo to visit a friend. I was talking to her mom about my idea and what I wanted to do, but having no clue how to do any of it. And she\u2019s like, \u201cWell, with all that ass you need to call it \u2018Onion.\u2019\u201d That\u2019s the messy version. The respectable version is I\u2019m answering the question, \u201cHow to dress for different kinds of women\u2014different sizes, different shapes, different needs, all while being stylish and comfortable.\u201d And for me that answer\u2014[from] that time onto this time\u2014is Onion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Mero tells it, despite any more lascivious overtones, the term \u201cOnion\u201d originated as a Southern euphemism for shapely figures. Forgoing fashion school in favor of Spelman College in her native Atlanta, she majored in sociology while continuing to hone her craft.\n\nAfter graduation and a stint in China, she based herself and her burgeoning business in New York City, where she began hosting trunk shows for her growing clientele. That\u2019s how Mero, an introvert who admits to being leery of the social aspects of retail, likes it:\n\n\n\nGrowing up, the idea of having a store where somebody would just have access to me was just not going to happen\u2014me having a place where you could just walk in? Fuck that. So I started at an early age, very early in the business, having these trunk sales. And then you can invite the people. You can set the tone, you get to control the setting ... it never occurred to me to have brick-and-mortar\u2014not just for that reason; the overhead is murder.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer lack of overhead, coupled with the growth of online retail, provided a model that perfectly suited both Mero\u2019s personality and the growth of Onion Cut & Sewn. Her line is a rarity in the retail sector: There are no manufacturers, and everything is truly cut and sewn by hand from whole cloth in the workshop that Mero also staffs and owns. Orders are as made-to-measure as possible and take 12-14 days to produce.\n\nMero describes it as \u201cpret-a-porter meets couture,\u201d yet amazingly, every item in her extensive line of dresses, separates and jumpsuits retails for under $200. It\u2019s a point of pride for the designer, all due to the strength of her online business:\n\nOnion should not be here; it\u2019s a beautiful accident. It should have been a lot harder for me. Having a store online and being able to take payments from damn near anywhere from anyone is really what grew the business.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut while technology makes it infinitely easier to sell, it\u2019s Mero\u2019s technical skill that developed her faithful following. She loves draping and primarily cuts on the bias; in her words: \u201cI love it when fabric moves with you, as opposed to you trying to make fabric do something that it doesn\u2019t do.\u201d\n\nAs a result, her designs\u2014some with names like \u201ctrap dress\u201d and \u201cfast lady\u201d\u2014naturally flatter a variety of figures. While undeniably feminine, they are never fussy, and remarkably feel as good as they are fashionable, thanks to Onion\u2019s signature fabric: jersey. Mero stumbled upon her favorite fabric almost by accident, but it\u2019s since become instrumental in creating the comfortable couture Onion is known for:\n\nI got really sick about 10 years ago, and I needed comfortable clothes. My skin was really jacked up, and I needed something that actually was soft and comforting. I started working with jersey, and then I just fell in love with it. ... I mean, I\u2019ve seen dresses fit a size 2, put that dress down and [get] picked up by a size 16, and it worked. You know, Miss Celie\u2019s pants. But I\u2019m a huge fan of jersey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlong with her love for the stretchy, travel-friendly cottons and rayons she uses in most of her designs, Mero is seemingly also her own muse. Her enviably compact and curvy frame is an ideal and relatable mannequin for her array of body-conscious but very forgiving silhouettes, and visitors to Onion Cut & Sewn\u2019s site will find the designer herself modeling most of her collection.\n\nIt could be argued that Mero represents the type of aspirational yet accessible allure her customers are seeking with every Onion purchase. But in her studio, she is refreshingly frank and unassuming, dressed down in a hoodie with her incredible hair in orbit around a bare face, while her impeccable cobalt manicure makes one wonder how she so effectively maneuvers a sewing machine. It\u2019s all part of Mero\u2019s personal credo, which extends to Onion Cut & Sewn\u2019s philosophy:\n\nYou put something on, and you feel great. I need it to feel like pajamas. ... But you know, the goal is, at the most, fundamental: Put one thing on and be able to leave the house and feel completely comfortable and confident in what you\u2019re wearing ... I want to design a star for people\u2014something that shines on you, without you necessarily having to shine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd women truly do shine in Mero\u2019s designs. Just ask good friend and #MeToo founder Tarana Burke, who wore a sequined black dress designed by Mero to grace this year\u2019s Golden Globes carpet. As Burke told The Glow Up:\n\nWhitney is a friend, but I have a very separate obsession with Onion Cut & Sewn. There was no question that I was going to wear one of her amazing creations on the red carpet at the Golden Globes. All of the women that night shied away from questions about who they were wearing, but I couldn\u2019t wait. I was proud to wear a black designer and proud to be wearing my girl\u2019s design. She makes impeccably tailored, comfortable, beautifully designed dresses, and the world should know about them.\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut while Mero finds Burke\u2019s choice to wear her design to the Golden Globes deeply meaningful, she says she couldn\u2019t care less about courting celebrity:\n\nYou know, people are celebrity-obsessed\u2014actually starstruck in a way that makes no sense. And I get that question: Well, what celebrities do you dress? And I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat the fuck [do] I need to dress celebrities for? I dress you. And unless you\u2019re telling me that you\u2019re not good enough\u2014which is not something I\u2019m ready to accept\u2014then stop asking me about celebrities. I don\u2019t care about a celebrity; ask them.\u201d I think that for Tarana to have basically lived a life of service without expectation, to be on the red carpet ... I love that version of it better than a model or an actor trying to be an activist, as opposed to a fashionable activist. I\u2019m not denigrating anyone, but you know the work has meaning. ... I\u2019d rather those people than celebrities, frankly, because celebrities have access to everything.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou likely also won\u2019t see Mero showing at New York Fashion Week, since she also doesn\u2019t do seasonal collections, telling us: \u201cThat means nothing to me. Whenever I want to introduce something new, I just introduce it.\u201d\n\nWhitney Mero is a woman who plays by her own rules. Similarly, her clothes represent a woman who has found both herself and her style, caring more about looking good than any fashion trend. Ironically, that\u2019s exactly what keeps an Onion Cut & Sewn design\u2014and its enchantingly irreverent designer\u2014always in fashion:", "keywords": ["know", "whitney", "onion", "sewn", "version", "im", "fabric", "comfortable", "having", "couture", "mero", "dress", "cut", "meros", "dressing"], "polarity": 0.27471558186159956, "subjectivity": 0.5654813303707109},

CVS is also asking brands that are sold in its stores to disclose which elements of a model\u2019s appearance have been altered in the ads for products on display.\n\nMSNBC\u2019s Joy Reid moderated a panel that included Matlins, Chief Marketing Officer of CVS Health Norman de Greve, Revlon-endorsed supermodel and body-positive activist Ashley Graham, activist beauty blogger and documentarian Noor Tagouri, and celebrity makeup artist and Honest Beauty spokesman Daniel Martin to discuss how truth in advertising can help alleviate some of the inadequacies we can feel when faced with unobtainable images of beauty presented as reality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmong the issues discussed were how how happiness is tied to expectations, and how well our expectations match reality\u2014or not\u2014in the digital era of filters and \u201cliquify\u201d tools that enhance not only professional but amateur photographs. In terms of how this affects self-esteem and body image, the statistics cited by panel members were eye-opening, even for a lot of industry vets in the audience:\n\n\n\n80 percent of women feel worse after looking at beauty ads.\n\n\n\n30 percent of high school girls have some type of eating disorder.\n\n\n\n42 percent of first- to third-graders want to be thinner.\n\n\n\n90 percent of girls ages 15-17 want to change one major thing about themselves.\n\n\n\nThe discussion also covered men and body issues, and boys who \u201cfeel more beautiful when they wear makeup,\u201d like Matlins\u2019 12-year-old son, who writes a blog about beauty for boys. Looking at the statistics\u2014and as a mom in midlife with a blog where I don\u2019t retouch, for all the reasons listed above\u2014I think the time is 100 percent right to make authentic individuality and self-acceptance the highest aspiration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can see the full one-hour talk here.", "keywords": ["cvs", "sold", "retouch", "panel", "beauty", "real", "products", "photographs", "feel", "finally", "girls", "advertising", "truth", "matlins"], "polarity": 0.27337625018659495, "subjectivity": 0.5197216002388416},

The year was 2013, and I was dealing with such gems as \u201cWhy is Precious cosplaying Princess Peach?\u201d \u201cPrincess Whale\u201d and \u201cGo and fry some chicken.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s at this point in the panel where I like to demonstrate the lack of fucks I had, just to inspire the audience. Because Gabby Sidibe is a plus-size, dark-skinned goddess. Whales are adorable and\u2014fun fact\u2014will team up on sharks and wreck them. As for the fried chicken, weeeeelll ... I fried up a batch and posted pictures all over my Tumblr and Facebook. My partner, to this day, says it\u2019s the best chicken she\u2019s ever had. Rage has never tasted so good, y\u2019all.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019ve given this panel many times, but during one particular show, the message hit me right in the feels, as the kids say. Pro tip: Never do a panel with someone who\u2019s been friends with you for over a decade; they\u2019ll dig up all kinds of receipts that you assumed were left in your college textbooks.\n\nThe truth is, I usually breeze through any parts that focus on my own insecurities: Yadda, yadda fat girl, weird black kid, and did I mention hella queer? Whatever, let\u2019s get to the part where I slay the trolls, OK?\n\n\n\nBut my girl Chealsey wasn\u2019t here for it: \u201cYou\u2019ve changed a lot over the years. I hadn\u2019t even seen your hair until you started cosplaying.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo there I was, feeling all kinds of exposed and thinking, \u201cShe\u2019s kidding, right?\u201d But dammit, Facebook had receipts, too, because there are pictures of college me wearing a variety of anime hats to cover my hair. I remembered thinking it was much easier to throw on random shirts, jeans and a hat instead of attempting to be like those flawless television college girls.\n\nBut this wasn\u2019t just a college thing. Those ratty old hats came with me after graduation, along with my incredibly drab wardrobe. But I didn\u2019t like shopping to begin with; hell, as long as the clothes fit and covered my fat self, that was\u2014\n\nOh.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile I was growing up, I\u2019d tell my mom time and time again that I hated dresses\u2014and Lord, keep that makeup away from me. But as I sat in the middle of a crowded room, dressed in a friggin\u2019 ball gown while I rocked my natural hair, I wondered if I really did hate the quote-unquote \u201cgirly stuff\u201d\u2014or did I just think it\u2019d be unflattering on my fat body?\n\nI remembered the trials and tribulations of navigating the multiple X\u2019s in clothing sizes. They\u2019d either be too tight or so loose that I might as well have been wearing a potato sack. And while there were\u2014and still are\u2014plus-size shops, they rarely have any kind of geek wear, compared with entire T-shirt sections at department stores. And do not insult me by typing Torrid in the comments, as if I don\u2019t already know they exist. That\u2019s one store, y\u2019all, and I\u2019ve already made peace with their geek selection predominantly being online and not heavily in-store like Hot Topic\u2019s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyone who cosplays will tell you that it\u2019s about the love you have for a character. For me, that love conquered years of self-doubt\u2014to a certain extent. Self-doubt, unfortunately, will always find a way; but cosplay was a chance to be something I thought I wasn\u2019t.\n\nIn costume, I could walk around as a princess or a queen who was adored by fans around the world. No one knew who I was beneath the wigs and mascara, and I preferred that over being the fat girl who constantly got unnecessary reminders of her fatness.\n\nBut the traits of the characters I portrayed started to become visible outside of my cosplay. Suddenly, dresses weren\u2019t limited to the weekends. My hat collection started to dwindle, and I was gaining a makeup collection. \u201cIt\u2019s for cosplay,\u201d I\u2019d say to myself, but the selfies and growing \u201cFeelin\u2019 Myself\u201d folder of pics proved otherwise.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I tell my harrowing story of internet attacks, I always say that my snappy 2013 response was due to turning 30. That\u2019s partially true. At that point, my confidence was no longer limited to playing dress-up: it had become a part of who I was, and part of who I strove to be.\n\nBut that fateful day, during that one particular show, I ended up crying in the middle of my own panel. I quietly told Cheals that I hated her, but she knew I didn\u2019t mean it, because I\u2019d finally decided to love myself enough to not hide my insecurities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the convention, I went home and edited my panel presentation. I don\u2019t skim through my insecurities anymore. Instead, I address them head on\u2014and, now, encourage others to do the same.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This series is in celebration of #28DaysOfBlackCosplay\u2014and of course, Marvel Studio\u2019s upcoming Black Panther.", "keywords": ["geek", "say", "learning", "love", "panel", "college", "cosplay", "dressup", "started", "playing", "fat", "black", "tell", "28daysblackofcosplay"], "polarity": 0.0806743377395551, "subjectivity": 0.5426958910654562},

The multidimensional author of A Beautiful Work in Progress has been making her way around the internet\u2014and on the pavement.\n\nRecently, she was featured in a J.C. Penney campaign with yogi Jessamyn Stanley as well as in a now-viral video with REI, where she reads an ugly email from an anonymous troll who accuses her of not being a runner because she\u2019s overweight. As director of equity and inclusion at Rabun Gap Nacoochee School, the Mirnavator\u2014a pseudonym to almost 30,000 Instagram followers\u2014wears many hats: Spanish instructor, cross-country coach and even, utilizing her Juilliard background, a chorus director; that is, when she\u2019s not beating down the trails or doing a Tough Mudder.\n\n\n\nFor those unfamiliar with her story, Valerio has consistently defied the stereotypes of what an ultrarunner looks like, while being featured by the Wall Street Journal, Runner\u2019s World, NBC Nightly News and CNN.\n\nMany have questioned if she can truly be both \u201cfat and fit\u201d while tackling courses like the Javelina Jundred and the TransRockies Run\u2014a whopping 62.13 and 120 miles, respectively. As she recounts in her book, her passion for fitness dates to her youth; but it was ultimately a health scare that gave her the jump start back into running.\n\n\u201cI was driving through the middle of Pennsylvania when I started getting chest pains, and thought I was having a heart attack,\u201d Valerio told HuffPost in October.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThankfully, it was a false alarm, but she followed up with a cardiologist who advised her to change her lifestyle or else she would die, leaving behind her son. During this period of her life, she was working around the clock, under high stress, with no relief, and not exercising. Her health scare pushed her to begin documenting her running journey with the public, sharing everything from her experiences of night running to talking about her fitness endeavors as a plus-size woman sometimes coming in DFL\u2014\u201ddead fucking last\u201d\u2014at trail races.\n\nAs a fellow runner and friend, I\u2019ve had the pleasure of celebrating an annual New Year\u2019s Day hike at Anthony\u2019s Nose with Valerio. This year, I couldn\u2019t help but ask a multitude of questions, wondering what sparked her to write her memoirs while also trying to balance her private life, teaching, training for the Boston Marathon and touring.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cActually, there is no balance; it\u2019s sort of a myth,\u201d she joked.\n\nThe boarding school where she works has been exceptionally accommodating to her ever-changing schedule, allowing her to maintain employment on a flexible schedule\u2014and allowing her teenage son to stay on campus while she tours several states.\n\nAlthough flattered by the media attention, she says she wanted to tell her own story of how she started her journey. So, since her October 2017 book launch, Merrell and REI have teamed up to help Valerio conduct a multicity sold-out book tour, allowing her to engage with thousands of people from Seattle to New York City.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdmittedly, amid the the waves of support from fans praising her astonishing accolades, she\u2019s consistently had to remind herself about self-care:\n\nWhen I was on the Rich Roll podcast, I had to put my phone down, because all day, I was getting a ton of messages and DMs on Instagram, on Twitter and all of my Facebook pages.\n\nTypically, it\u2019s questions like \u201cWow, how did you get started?\u201d But the Merrell, Skirt Sports and Swiftwick Socks ambassador noted that there are times the questions get tough. Although she strives to answer every message, she hopes that living in her truth will serve as an unspoken example for others to pursue their passions despite shape, size, disability or background:\n\nIt\u2019s cool knowing that people reach out and share themselves in that way; it may sound crass or caustic, but I cannot solve everyone\u2019s problems. I hope that through seeing and observing me through my social media accounts that they do receive the inspiration that they need to get out of whatever hold that they\u2019re in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer ambitious calendar is currently loaded with events such as a 50K with the North Face Endurance in Washington, D.C.; a 10K the following day; a host of Tough Mudders; and traveling to the Azores Island to do a trail run.\n\nLike many, I wondered if there were any other books in her future. Although there are no confirmations yet, she hinted that she will be involved in several major projects that will touch on running and beyond.\n\nSo what advice does a motivational speaker and accomplished runner offer to those who want to get themselves started in fitness?\n\nWrite down your goals first. Speak them out to the universe, and then create a plan. If you want to start running or start weightlifting, write it down. Make sure that goal is actually achievable; you should have a SMART goal or plan. Break up your goals into smaller ones. Temper your schedule accordingly, and then work towards each goal without overwhelming yourself with the bigger goals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition, I personally suggest creating and sticking your vision board somewhere visible, like on your refrigerator; actually look at it. Be patient with your body. Stop retraumatizing yourself with negative stories.\n\nJust like when you tell yourself something positive while practicing self-love and care, negative thoughts work the same, in the opposite way. When you continue being overcritical of yourself, it retraumatizes you and may even change your DNA. Let\u2019s take a cue from Mirna Valerio, and change our DNA in a positive way!", "keywords": ["fatgirlrunning", "shes", "valerio", "tough", "naysayers", "work", "started", "questions", "mirna", "way", "start", "runner", "shuts", "running", "selfcare", "promotes", "ultrarunner"], "polarity": 0.07558436330175462, "subjectivity": 0.43855992638601327},

Stay strong and find motivation.\u201d Two years ago, I applied this same perspective to pole dancing. I transitioned from joking about having two left feet to signing up for a pole dancing course; I left feeling excited and hopeful.\n\n\n\nBefore long, I performed in a pole dancing showcase in the middle of marathon and obstacle-course training, as another demonstration of my athleticism. But despite my sense of pride, rampant stigmas about the sport persist. I\u2019ve experienced everything from being told that it\u2019s too \u201cprovocative\u201d to being personally reminded that I am a parent who needs to \u201cmaintain my integrity.\u201d To debunk a few stereotypes about this highly athletic activity, I spoke with five fierce pole athletes about their experiences as instructors, performers and students.\n\n1. Ashley Fox\n\nAshley Fox, owner and pole sport instructor of Foxy Fitness & Pole in New York City and New Jersey, is a powerhouse who\u2019s earned numerous accolades from competitions across the world. Her extensive r\u00e9sum\u00e9 includes several pole dancing competitions, including the 2016 Paragon Championship. She was subsequently first runner-up in the 2017 Pole Olympia Championship. She will be holding workshops at the International Pole Convention and Pole Expo in late 2018.\n\nDespite her gymnastics, dance and cheerleading background, Fox found her athleticism in pole training. \u201cPole is the best because it combines elements from all forms of fitness and dance. The challenge of mastering strength, flexibility and dance really maximizes your physical ability,\u201d she says. \u201cBefore pole, I just felt like my body was regular; now I feel strong and feminine. I see myself as a beauty beast.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Yumiko Harris\n\nFox\u2019s general manager and pole sport instructor Yumiko Harris shared similar sentiments about the intense sport. Harris, a contemporary-dance graduate of the University of North Carolina School of the Arts, went through an artistic freeze after being burned-out by college. Before becoming the 2017 Northeast Pole Championship first place winner, she even experienced a stint of depression.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThrough a cousin\u2019s encouragement, she signed up for her first pole class. \u201cI wasn\u2019t intrigued by the appeal of bringing on your sexy,\u201d Harris says. Despite her self-proclaimed lackluster first experience, she left feeling invigorated about dancing again.\n\nAfter researching the requirements of becoming a pole dancing instructor, she took a leap of faith, leaving Chicago and pursuing a career as an instructor at Fox\u2019s New York City studio. \u201cPole dancing is empowering to the mind, body and soul because it\u2019s an individual or team sport,\u201d Harris says. \u201cIt creates that community of women becoming stronger together, not through sexuality but strength. We\u2019ve come so far now with pole sport that they\u2019re pushing it into the Olympics.\u201d\n\n3. Veronica Jamison\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIllustrator Veronica Jamison took a similar route, letting her interest lead her to becoming an instructor. Jamison, a pole dance instructor at Pole Haus in Philadelphia, went from taking pole classes once or twice a week to embarking on a teacher-training program just months after enrollment. Despite her recreational dancer background, she sometimes felt out of place being a curvy plus-size woman.\n\n\u201cI have been a curvy woman my entire adult life,\u201d Jamison says. \u201cPole dancing has been instrumental in me getting over my body image issues. It really made me appreciate my body, transitioning from wanting to change it to getting into the mold of being marveled at for what it can do. Before I started pole dancing, I was really self-conscious about my body\u2014the fact that I work in fashion didn\u2019t help. Being around my pole family, seeing others not self-conscious about their bodies or passing judgment, helped me appreciate what I can do.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve gotten feedback like, \u2018What is your husband saying?\u2019 And if people have something to say about it, they have their own assumptions about it. It\u2019s not my job to convince them why I do it,\u201d she adds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Tina Powell\n\nActress and pole dancer Tina Powell has been teaching for a little over a year at the Choreography House in North Hollywood and Evolve Pole Dance in Los Angeles. She admits that like many, her perception of pole dancing was initially askew:\n\nI came to pole dancing accidentally by winning a free class. I never would\u2019ve tried it otherwise. I am generally an open-minded person and feel women can do as they please with their bodies, as long as no one is harmed. Yet I used to have reservations about stripping and pole dancing. I assumed exotic dancers must have emotional issues [and] low self-esteem and standards if they were \u201cselling sex\u201d and their bodies. Because of these misconceptions, I never saw the draw to pole dancing as a hobby, and I certainly didn\u2019t think of it as a sport. I realize now that pole dancing is not necessarily about sexuality. There are so many different styles of pole, though I prefer the sensual type. But I know when I dance, I\u2019m never thinking about sex or that unsolicited dick pic. Rather, pole dancing is about letting go of self-judgment, and moving with purpose. A huge part of a woman\u2019s power is in her sensuality. That power intimidates many men and makes them feel a need to shame us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. Roz Mays\n\nConversely, National Academy of Sports Medicine-certified personal trainer and 10-year pole dancer Roz \u201cthe Diva\u201d Mays doesn\u2019t have a dancer background. \u201cMy first class was disaster dot com,\u201d she says. \u201cI love to dance and I have a Beyonc\u00e9 complex. I remember coming home thinking it\u2019s the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done in my life, and it\u2019s still the hardest sport I\u2019ve done, but I love it.\u201d Although she didn\u2019t have preconceptions about the activity, she took it on as a hobby through a class offered at Crunch Gym.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve gone through different periods of my own style where I want to be Black Swan, and other times where I want to dance like Black Chyna,\u201d Mays continues. \u201cThere\u2019s a stereotype that we\u2019re a bunch of hos or wannabe strippers. We\u2019re actually not\u2014and shoutout to strippers, because they work 10 times harder than we do.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, Mays is no stranger to hazing from the internet:\n\nPeople think that me doing a sport at my size is promoting obesity. There\u2019s isn\u2019t anything that people can write about me on the internet that\u2019s worse than anything that I said about myself. When people call me fat, ugly or a man, it\u2019s still 10 times nicer than the things that I said. Before poling, I thought I was disgusting beyond belief. There was no relationship between me and my body. After pole, I am starting to heal. Never once in my lifetime have I embraced my body. People make that assumption and it\u2019s not true\u2014I have a better view of myself physically, but I have 30 years of damage, and it\u2019s going to take some years to reverse it. For the first four or five years, I thought I was too big to wear pole shorts. When I did get the guts, it was like the weight of the world lifted off of my shoulders. I remember the first class that I did that six years ago; I cried until my eyes were swimming on my bed. It was a relief cry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAcross the board, all five instructors strongly urged potential students to attend just one class. Neither sweaty palms nor a lack of upper body strength serves as an excuse to avoid trying. Instead, be consistent and present and learn the foundation. Regardless of your shape, size, gender or disability, you should feel comfortable coming to class. If a one-armed pole dancer can eloquently pursue her passion on the pole, you shouldn\u2019t let stereotypes discourage you. \u201cDo your research, wear shorts and let us do the rest,\u201d says Yumiko Harris. Investigate which style works best for you, and allow pole dancing to invigorate your life in the new year.\n\n", "keywords": ["class", "defying", "gravity", "debunk", "dare", "instructor", "athletes", "stereotypesand", "feel", "body", "harris", "pole", "sport", "dance", "dancing", "dancer", "try"], "polarity": 0.14718147641831852, "subjectivity": 0.485269274585064},

We are nearly at the four-year mark, and although there has been some change, it has been slow, and the end is still not here. The city doesn\u2019t get as many headlines in the news, at least not nationally, but despite that\u2014Will and Jaden Smith\u2019s water company cares, if don\u2019t nobody else care.\n\nMLive.com reports that Just Water, an eco-friendly water company started by the celebrity father-son duo, donated 9,200 bottles of water to the city and will continue to do so on a monthly basis until lead levels in the water at Flint public schools are below the federal threshold.\n\nJust Water CEO Ira Laufer told MLive that the donation was a \u201cno-brainer.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis just makes sense for us to do,\u201d Laufer said. \u201cJada Smith has visited Flint and met with the mayor. Flint is very dear to her heart. ...

Its packaging is crafted from almost all-renewable sources, and Laufer said that its water comes from an ethically sourced model contributing to the economy in Glenn Falls, N.Y.\n\nRegarding Flint schools, although initial tests conducted in February showed that lead levels were below the federal action limit, five of nine elementary schools had at least one test that exceeded that threshold.\n\nFor the last 18 months, the city of Flint\u2019s water supply has tested within federal guidelines for lead, but residents are still cautioned to use bottled water or faucet filters as a precaution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe city currently has five state-funded bottled water and faucet-filter distribution centers.\n\nA large-scale review of the city\u2019s water quality is expected to begin later this month, but the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality says that there\u2019s no timeline for making recommendations about Flint once that review is complete.\n\nEven without school district lead-testing results, state officials have been talking about reconsidering the water-distribution programs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFlint Mayor Karen Weaver has gone on record to say that the state should continue supplying bottled water to the city until all lead and galvanized services lines in the city have been replaced\u2014something that could take until the year 2020 to complete.\n\nIn a statement to MLive, Weaver said:\n\nI have been, and still am, a proponent of bottled water being provided to residents until all lead-tainted service lines leading to homes in Flint have been replaced. I feel even stronger about this position after recent water test results from Flint schools, provided by [the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality] showed results where lead levels were above the level recommended by the medical community of 5 [parts per billion], as well as the Lead and Copper Rule action level of 15 ppb.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the meantime, Just Water sent four pallets of water to the Food Bank of Eastern Michigan on March 1.\n\nCathy Blankenship, Food Bank vice president of development, said that the donation is \u201cgreatly appreciated.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always generous that people are still thinking about Flint,\u201d Blankenship said.", "keywords": ["quality", "jaden", "donate", "mlive", "monthly", "lead", "flint", "water", "bottled", "michigan", "smith", "city", "results", "schools", "levels"], "polarity": 0.11126543209876544, "subjectivity": 0.3410493827160494},
{"url": "https://theglowup.theroot.com/body-politics-transforming-your-transformationtuesday-1821639489", "title": "/body-politics-transforming-your-transformationtuesday-", "text": "#TransformationTuesday, a popular hashtag that encourages people to share their fitness success stories, has collected more than 11 million tags on social platforms such as Instagram and Twitter. Like many, I\u2019ve indulged in my share of posts showcasing my weight-loss journey and muscle gains. But though visuals can be inspiring, they can also haunt like the Ghost of Christmas Past.\n\n\n\nSeveral statistics and articles state that up to 95 percent of people who experience rapid weight loss from dieting will experience weight gain. Despite not jumping on the diet-pill wagon or seeking a quick fix, I fell into the statistics of people who gained some of their weight back within three years. For many, gaining the weight back represents failure, and can make one feel bitter and defeated. With this in mind, I wondered: Is it possible to associate the benefits of #TransformationTuesday with nonscale victories? Let\u2019s try.\n\nConsistently Incorporate Fitness Into Your Life\n\nLess than a week ago, I came across size-inclusive fitness-clothing company Superfit Hero\u2019s Instagram account and saw its hashtag #NewFitSpo, which encourages women to reclaim their bodies and redefine what fitness inspiration looks like for themselves. Hint: It doesn\u2019t take going to the gym six days a week to attain this goal. Instead, opt to start small by increasing your activity to three times a week for 20-30 minutes a day.\n\nTake on a New Activity\n\nThere\u2019s a pair of boxing gloves that has been collecting dust on the weight bench for two years. Maybe you\u2019ve been dying to try out a yoga class, but worried about committing to monthly fees. Consider jumping on sites like Groupon to become the next Laila Ali or headstand hero (or something like that). If your pockets are still recovering from the holiday season, look into free or pay-by-donation classes within your area.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMix Healthier Dishes Into Your Diet\n\nFrankly, the word \u201cdiet\u201d scares the hell out of me, and I want no part of it. Instead, I love eating filling, flavorful dishes that prevent me from feeling stuffed. Throw some extra spinach into your omelet, or take on a #MeatlessMonday challenge that motivates you to include more vegetables and fruits in your diet. Studies show that cooking at home not only helps your diet but also may help in keeping more money in your pocket. You don\u2019t have to be a culinary guru or spend an excessive amount of time on intricate dishes. Meal prepping is helpful for everyone, from the single person juggling two jobs to a hectic family of six who crave 30 minutes of downtime.\n\nChange Up Your Makeup Routine\n\nI\u2019d like to say I\u2019m the biggest tomboy on the planet, but I have a newfound love for blending together MAC\u2019s NC-45 and NC-50 foundations to achieve my desired shade. Years ago, I found myself fascinated with watching professional makeup artists work their magic on human canvases while assisting on my husband\u2019s photography set. My curiosity slowly transitioned from picking their brains about contouring to following YouTube tutorials for a natural look. In a matter of a few months, I became pretty decent at finding lip colors and bronzers that compliment my skin. You can, too: Apply that #TransformationTuesday hashtag by unleashing your inner Destiny Godley.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShock Yourself and Wear a Bold Outfit\n\nGabrielle Union\u2019s clothing collection with New York & Co. has been reviving my womp-womp wardrobe from the dead. Her fashions have been making a chunky girl feel fat-girl-fresh for weeks! I sported one of her jumpsuits for a holiday party, and you couldn\u2019t tell me nothing; almost made me forget that I generally live in fitness gear. You can switch up your style, too: Pizzazz your life with something vibrant and different from your everyday wear. At the very least, put on some cute accessories and slay.\n\nWhat does all of this have to do with #TransformationTuesday? Every single thing. It\u2019s easy to admire all photos from strangers, wishing for the results they have.

I was the first child of my African immigrant parents to take ballet and gymnastic classes. I was their first Girl Scout, first overpriced prom experience and first recipient of their Parent Plus college loan. Together, we navigated mainstream America while eating Ghanaian food at home.\n\n\n\nI was confident in my cultural identity, but juxtaposed with my black American peers and white counterparts, whose customs were different from my own, my acquiescence into self-actualization at times was challenged. My coming-of age years were as diverse as a piping-hot pot of jollof rice.\n\nMy quaint family attended Ghanaian traditional baptisms and funerals adorned in kente cloth and other garb normalizing African culture in my New England neighborhood. Mom wrapped her hair in a duku head scarf similar to Ramonda in Black Panther. My cousins and I wore bright Ankara-print fabrics like Okoye, Nakia and Shuri as we served food and drinks at Ghanaian social events. My dad and uncles donned Entumas like Zuri, although they weren\u2019t used as protective shields, as they were for Black Panther\u2019s warriors. Our African attire wasn\u2019t a costume. My parents brought Ghana to small-town America.\n\nThree weeks into the Marvel movie\u2019s debut, filmgoers across the country have been flooding social media with pictures of themselves in African garb. Men, women and children across the Diaspora feel connected to the \u201cAfricanness\u201d of Black Panther, and it\u2019s a beautiful, melanin-filled sight to see.\n\nThe film connects black Americans to a continent that has ben positioned as mysterious, disease-infested and dark to the Western world. Moreover, most African Americans are descendants of the slave trade, whose African heritage, customs and religion were deliberately erased and replaced with a European system created by colonizers. Watching the two worlds marry in Hollywood matrimony is prime black pride.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the spirit of Black Panther and African pride, I\u2019d like my fellow blacks across the country to keep Africa closer to their hearts, like the way my parents kept Ghana close to our souls. How can we further connect to Africa beyond aesthetics? How can we sustain this feeling of Afrocentric bliss, ensuring that it doesn\u2019t become a fad?\n\nI spoke with Linda Heywood, a professor of African-American studies and history at Boston University, and Gina Paige, president and co-founder of African Ancestry, for historical context and action steps that African Americans can take toward living their best Wakanda lives from the inside out.\n\n[Editor\u2019s note: This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.]\n\nThe Root: Is this moment of African Americans connecting to Africa sustainable?\n\nPhoto: Boston University\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLinda Heywood: There always this need for more Africa, from W.E.B. Du Bois to Martin Luther King, and ... then you have the 1957 Ghana independence; that was the first step. In the 1980s and \u201990s, Africa kind of went underground in a certain way because the image we were seeing of Africa [was] so negative. So it\u2019s like this is a reawakening of the connection to Africa. I think that\u2019s excellent, but we need to sustain it.\n\nGina Paige: The entire community has benefited from the impact of Black Panther promoting pride in being of African descent. As more people want to celebrate their Africanness, they naturally want to find their own \u201cWakanda.\u201d We have seen an increased interest in people wanting to know which African country and tribe or ethnic group they share ancestry with.\n\nTR: How does finding your ancestry help with connecting to the continent?\n\nLH: There\u2019s a deep family connection [in finding your DNA]. People need to know they are connected to something. If you think, \u201cOh, I\u2019m the descendant of slaves,\u201d then you think, \u201cOh, I\u2019m not connected to anything,\u201d because slavery was a temporary status that went on far too long.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGP: African Americans want to connect with Africa because our histories were stolen from us through bondage. As a result of the trans-Atlantic slave trade, we lost our names, our languages, the freedom to honor our ancestors, and our families were sold apart. You cannot know who you are if you don\u2019t have any of those things. We don\u2019t know where we are from, and we cannot use genealogy records to find out. You cannot know who you are if you don\u2019t know where you are from.\n\nTR: How can we expect to feel knowing our biological background?\n\nLH: Why should we be always connected to slavery? We have to make our own interpretation. Don\u2019t let people put on us that status. Connecting to Africa is one way, but it\u2019s not the way out.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: African Ancestry\n\nGP: People feel all sorts of emotions upon receiving their results. They are overwhelmed, happy, surprised, proud, excited, curious and more. They immediately want to learn about the people and countries and share the information with their family members.\n\nTR: How can children learn more about Africa?\n\nLH: Not many students are learning about Africa. We have to get in those images. Not just for Black History Month. Not just Martin Luther King and Malcolm X. Junior high schoolers need to be brought into Africa in more realistic ways so that we have not just creative stories, but bring in the stories of real people who had to make real decisions and make choices. Rulers, whether they are female or male, have to make choices, and we have those elements for Europe. Let us have more for Africa. Teachers have to be able to put that into the curriculum.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: Where can the average adult start learning about the history of Africa?\n\nLH: Start by reading biographies. Be realistic in how you look at your African past history, your heroes and heroines. For men, there\u2019s Shaka Zulu (South Africa), Mansa Musa (West African Mali empire) and Asantehene (Ghana). For women, there\u2019s Nana Yaa Asantewaa (Ghana), Queen Amina (Nigeria), Queen Njinga (Angola).\n\nGP: Ethnic groups are extremely important to knowing who we are because they are the social factors that dictate culture. The top five tribes for African Americans are Fulani, Mende, Balanta, Yoruba and Tikar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: Beyond history, how else can we live our best Wakanda life in America?\n\nLH: We have to travel outside of the United States: Senegal, Ghana, Angola, Zambia, South Africa, Tanzania, Zanzibar. There are lots of sites in Africa. This is where the deep history is.\n\nGP: Take an African Ancestry test, travel, research; reading, listening to music; meet people from Africa who live in the United States; attend festivals; watch documentaries and films produced in African countries.

Chance's happiness is a dose of joy that many black men deserve.\n\nThe climate in America right now is hostile, to say the least.

Donald Glover\n\nGIF\n\nHe's a rapper, singer, actor, director, writer, producer, comedian and composer, and the list goes on. This is one creative black man who uses each of his talents to create art. In Donald Glover's new comedy series, Atlanta, we get to see him living through a stereotype of blackness but not limit that character to a monolithic expression of what it means to be a black man in the South. There's nothing more refreshing than someone like Glover, who completely shatters stereotypes.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. Jaden Smith\n\nYou mind if I wild out ?

There's no denying the privilege that Jaden Smith's been born into, so forgive him if that privilege has led him to live a life of freedom. He has never been caught drunk or stealing\u2014or having a dozen children by different women. He's simply a teen who enjoys a life of reasonable self-expression.\n\n\n\n6. Jidenna\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSure, he's a \"Classic Man,\" but Jidenna brings the flavor and joy of South Africa into everything he does.

Usain Bolt\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis guy is clearly one of the best Olympic track-and-field athletes of all time. He might actually be the best. I know that he's certainly the most impressive. I root for him as if he's on the American team. Usain Bolt runs with ease while everyone around him huffs and puffs. He may be seen as cocky, but honestly, he is just that damn good. If I ran like that, I'd dance on the finish line, too!\n\n\n\n8. Drake\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTypically known for his sadness or his \u201cnonmasculine\u201d emotions, Drake is a surprising addition to this list. But if you watch him the way I am, you'll see that Drake is a very happy guy, despite his lyrics. Drake redefines masculinity\u2014often making it acceptable to cry over a woman (or be vulnerable toward her), dance in public and smile every once in a while. When was the last time a rapper danced in a video the way Drake does? Exactly\u2014that's black-boy joy!\n\n\n\n9.

He seamlessly switches from singing to rapping and playing drums, sometimes at the same damn time, and the look on his face during his performances is nothing short of pure joy.\n\n\n\n10. Andre 3000\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerhaps Mr. Benjamin was the first young black rapper to celebrate his own joy on and off the track. We've watched as Andre 3000's career allowed him to stretch the confines of hip-hop, often bringing us anthems that made him the standout star of OutKast. Never forget that it was he who allowed us to shake it like a Polaroid pic\u2019cha!\n\n11. Young Thug\n\n\"\"JEFFERY\"\" is out now..

There's a common thread in #BlackBoyJoy: a fearlessness about being unique and true to what and who you are. Thug is certainly hip-hop, but he turns the genre on its head and offers catchy tunes with very interesting visuals. The cover of his latest mixtape, No, My Name Is Jeffery, shows Thug all dressed up, literally. Many may label him \"weird,\" but I think he's innovative and fresh and definitely exhibiting joy.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n12. Desiigner\n\nGIF\n\nThis young rapper made the song that none of us can get out of our heads: \u201cPanda, panda, panda!\u201d And even if many of us are still not sure he's not Future, Desiigner has made a name for himself in hip-hop.

Because this quote\u2026\n\n\"\u2026the new pieces are suffused with a different sort of bareness, and a self-guided education in topics such as Archimedean solids and mysticism\"\n\n\u2026is used to describe Jaden Smith's new album.\n\n3. Because 12-year-old Willow Smith is currently reading up on quantum physics and Osho. Which\u2026are you fucking kidding me?\n\n4. Because Willow gave her answer so that it was two sentences (\"Quantum physics. Osho.\") instead of just one. This was intentional. Willow Smith is an event horizon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. Because as an answer to the very next effing question, Willow admits she is going to enter the NBA dunk contest next year. Well, she either said that or that she believes \"time\" doesn't exist. I forget which one.\n\n6. Because the \"melancholiness of the ocean\" is one of the themes in Jaden's work, which means HE HAS PERSONIFIED THE MOTHERFUCKING OCEAN!\n\n7. Because Jaden \"burst into laughter\" after hearing Willow say \"the feeling of being like, this is a fragment of a holographic reality that a higher consciousness made\" \u2014 the first sign Jaden's body might contain molecules and Pop Tarts and shit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. Because this quote from Willow\u2026\n\n\"\u2026caring less and less about what your own mind thinks, because what your own mind thinks, sometimes, is the thing that makes you sad\"\n\n\u2026made me cry for 10 minutes.\n\n9. Because I'm still crying.\n\n10. Because I'm done crying, and now I want to find some parsley. And I want to spread the parsley on a canvas. And I want to get some rubber cement, three lightly-used alkaline batteries, a duck liver, and Dame Judi Dench to help me create OH MY GOD WILLOW SMITH HAS INFECTED MY BRAIN!\n\nAdvertisement\n\n11. Because the answers about the evolution of their music and the writing process\u2026are refreshing, make a lot of sense, and are actually good pieces of advice for any young person or aspiring artist.\n\n12. Because Willow Smith writes her own novels. And she doesn't like to read novels. So she writes her own novels so she can read them. Which is like eating your own poop because you hate everyone else's food.\n\n13. Because, according to Jaden, she's been doing this since she was six.\n\n14. Because \"Me and Jaden just figured out that our voices sound like chocolate together\" is the best quote I've ever read.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n15. Because I just lied. \"Think about how many car accidents happen every day. Driver\u2019s ed? What\u2019s up?\" is actually the best quote I've ever read.\n\n16. Because I had to google \"prana energy\" again because I forgot what it means.\n\n17. Because there will be another Michael Jordan. There will be another Mahatma Gandhi. There will even be another K. Michelle. But there will never be another Willow and Jaden Smith.

It\u2019s me, the resident fat, beautiful black woman and writer from The Root coming to you with an important message about fat-shaming, sex and the supposed undesirability many of you impose on fat women because of your own insecurities.\n\nIn a word: Stop that shit.\n\nI was browsing Twitter on Monday and caught wind of Usher\u2019s latest accuser coming forward in the ongoing saga of his alleged-herpes-exposure lawsuits. I didn\u2019t get very far before I saw this tweet from self-proclaimed funnyman Lil Duval, in which he included a picture of the young woman and said, \u201cI refuse to believe Usher fucked this.\u201d\n\nThe young woman in the picture is full-figured. Plus size. Pleasingly plump. Whatever cute descriptor you can use to describe her, it all boils down to one thing: She\u2019s fat, and that\u2019s OK.\n\nWhat\u2019s not OK is shaming her or imposing your own insecurities onto her, which is what Lil Duval did. He doubled down in his next tweet by saying, \u201cI\u2019ll believe Usher gay before I believe he fucked that girl.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat the fuck?\n\nWe all already know Lil Duval is a gaping herpes sore on the ass of black comedy, so while his comments didn\u2019t catch me by surprise, they made me think about the similarity between his words about this young woman and things I\u2019ve experienced as a writer and sex-positive, body-positive black woman who is highly visible on the internet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019ve written about this before. There is something about fat women\u2014but, most especially, fat black women\u2014that makes people extremely uncomfortable. Why is that?\n\nEvery day, no matter what topic I am writing about or discussing, it is inevitable that detractors will come along and try to fight me. They realize very quickly that they are not going to be able to successfully argue with me on the merits of my points, so when all else fails, they fall into fat insults. It happens every time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNever mind that in my profile on every social network and here on Kinja, I am wearing a shirt that proclaims my chubby physique proudly. Never mind that I\u2019m actually mostly just top heavy with a pudgy belly. Never mind that they know nothing about my personal physical health; they want to attack it every time. I am used to it by now; it\u2019s par for the course.\n\nThose fat insults, however, turn even more vicious whenever the topic I am discussing is sex.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you follow me on Twitter, then you know that I am sex-positive and discuss various topics related to sex all the time. It\u2019s no secret that I am openly nonmonogamous, a believer in polyamory and a size queen with no gag reflex who loves a big dick.\n\nI talk about it all the time, and when I do, there is a chorus of idiots who fall into my Twitter mentions to tell me how undesirable I am. They swear up and down that no one wants to fuck me. I, a fat, beautiful black woman with large, pendulous breasts, a girthy waistline, long legs and a sweet smell, am somehow less desirable and unworthy of sex because they said so.\n\nThis is what they tell me.\n\nThere are politics involved in labeling. I alluded to that earlier when I used all the flowery descriptors for Usher\u2019s accuser. For most people, there are two categories of big girls: fat and thick.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet\u2019s get right to the shit.\n\nAs Twitter user @hausmuva aptly pointed out, \u201cthick = respectable fatness.\u201d Think Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s post-pregnancy body and Rihanna\u2019s Carnival body. Both women are slightly heavier in all the right places, and everyone, including me, is in love with the thickness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI mean, be for real\u2014both of these women are looking like snacks right now, as if they didn\u2019t already on a regular basis.\n\nBut here\u2019s the deal: As @hausmuva continues, we are OK with the added weight on Rihanna and Beyonc\u00e9 because they are \u201cvacationing in it.\u201d The expectation is that they will shed the extra pounds and go back to the bodies that we are used to. But what if they didn\u2019t? Would that make them less sexy?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo one is concern-trolling Rihanna or Beyonc\u00e9 over her weight gain. As one Twitter user put it, their gains are viewed as \u201cresponsible,\u201d and therefore not unhealthy like the rest of us fatties.\n\nListen. Don\u2019t let fatness fool you. We get more sex than you guys think. Some of your faves not only desire our sex but prefer it. I have the DMs, private messages and sexual track record to prove it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are those who fetishize it, otherwise known as chubby chasers, and there are those who simply prefer plus-size women over everything else.\n\nThere are also those who just don\u2019t allow a person\u2019s size to be a factor when feeling desire toward them. They simply see a person, they feel attraction and they go for what they know.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have experienced all of these in my lifetime.\n\nThe thing about me is, I have never let my size be a hindrance to me. I have never let it make me shy away from going for what I want, because as a heterosexual woman, I feel that any man I want can be had.\n\nI am the perfect combination of pretty, sassy, funny, intelligent and champion code-switcher. I can fit in with any crowd with ease, and I have found myself hit on by men of every ethnicity and culture because of it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut according to the fat-shamers, I shouldn\u2019t be this confident. According to the fat-shamers, no one wants me based on my weight alone. According to the fat-shamers, I should stay humble and in my place.\n\nFuck that.\n\nA lot of this is based heavily in the white male gaze and the white male standard of beauty. We know this because a white man made a post on Instagram and wanted applause for loving his wife, a plus-size white woman. He got the accolades he was looking for, but what is that shit, really?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn writing that Instagram post, he basically tells the world that he is special because he is brave enough to go against the norm and love his wife anyway, despite her curves and thigh dimples. He essentially fat-shames his wife and uses her as a prop to get kudos for himself.\n\nFuck that guy.\n\nThe fat-shaming does not just come from men, however. Women actively participate in it, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe pervasive competitiveness between women where it comes to the male gaze, black or white, is always amplified when the woman being gazed upon is fat. The smaller woman feels a need to shame because, for whatever reason, a fat woman who is getting attention over her is taken as some sort of personal affront.\n\nThis has got to stop. What I (or any other fat person, for that matter) eats don\u2019t make you shit. Who chooses to bed me (or any other fat person) should not be of concern to you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf I\u2019m not your cup of tea, that\u2019s totally cool, but why do you insist on imposing your own insecurities on me and all the rest of the fatties?\n\nWhat are we doing that makes you feel like there\u2019s not enough sex to go around for all of us? I can get mine, and you can get yours, too.\n\nWhy does the fact that I am fat make you think that I am undeserving of love, affection, enormous erections and hot, sweaty sex?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy does the idea that I am getting that on a regular basis make you so uncomfortable?\n\nJust because fat black women have fixed your plates, kissed your knee scrapes, ironed your clothes and hugged away the pain doesn\u2019t mean that we don\u2019t like to fuck and do it well.\n\nYou look at fat black women as being mothers and aunties. And if we aren\u2019t maternal\u2014because the expectation that we must be is some bullshit\u2014that doesn\u2019t make us any less desirable. We can still kiss it and make it better.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs April Reign said on Twitter, \u201cMeanwhile, there\u2019s a reason why they call your grandma \u2018Big Mama.\u2019\u201d\n\nImplying that fat women are wholly undesirable and unworthy of sex or sexual attention betrays your own insecurities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to have your own personal preference of what you like and don\u2019t like; it\u2019s entirely another thing to impose that preference on other people, especially when it is not already there for them.\n\nFat women aren\u2019t going away. We are moving more and more into the mainstream. Perhaps that is what makes you uncomfortable.\n\nWhatever it is, now is the time to get over yourselves, because not only are fat women here to stay, but we are here to claim all the love and sex that is being showered upon us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo amount of fat-shaming is going to stop that.\n\nYou can turn up your nose, make your snide comments, and wish you were in control of our bodies and our sexual autonomy.\n\nWe will be over here minding our business, enjoying our sex lives and not worrying about what you are doing in yours.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n*Laughs a great, big belly laugh.*", "keywords": ["sex", "think", "thing", "twitter", "white", "fat", "lots", "does", "bother", "black", "women", "beautiful", "dont", "woman"], "polarity": 0.1121140430694571, "subjectivity": 0.5421430904551922},

I was the first child of my African immigrant parents to take ballet and gymnastic classes. I was their first Girl Scout, first overpriced prom experience and first recipient of their Parent Plus college loan. Together, we navigated mainstream America while eating Ghanaian food at home.\n\n\n\nI was confident in my cultural identity, but juxtaposed with my black American peers and white counterparts, whose customs were different from my own, my acquiescence into self-actualization at times was challenged. My coming-of age years were as diverse as a piping-hot pot of jollof rice.\n\nMy quaint family attended Ghanaian traditional baptisms and funerals adorned in kente cloth and other garb normalizing African culture in my New England neighborhood. Mom wrapped her hair in a duku head scarf similar to Ramonda in Black Panther. My cousins and I wore bright Ankara-print fabrics like Okoye, Nakia and Shuri as we served food and drinks at Ghanaian social events. My dad and uncles donned Entumas like Zuri, although they weren\u2019t used as protective shields, as they were for Black Panther\u2019s warriors. Our African attire wasn\u2019t a costume. My parents brought Ghana to small-town America.\n\nThree weeks into the Marvel movie\u2019s debut, filmgoers across the country have been flooding social media with pictures of themselves in African garb. Men, women and children across the Diaspora feel connected to the \u201cAfricanness\u201d of Black Panther, and it\u2019s a beautiful, melanin-filled sight to see.\n\nThe film connects black Americans to a continent that has ben positioned as mysterious, disease-infested and dark to the Western world. Moreover, most African Americans are descendants of the slave trade, whose African heritage, customs and religion were deliberately erased and replaced with a European system created by colonizers. Watching the two worlds marry in Hollywood matrimony is prime black pride.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the spirit of Black Panther and African pride, I\u2019d like my fellow blacks across the country to keep Africa closer to their hearts, like the way my parents kept Ghana close to our souls. How can we further connect to Africa beyond aesthetics? How can we sustain this feeling of Afrocentric bliss, ensuring that it doesn\u2019t become a fad?\n\nI spoke with Linda Heywood, a professor of African-American studies and history at Boston University, and Gina Paige, president and co-founder of African Ancestry, for historical context and action steps that African Americans can take toward living their best Wakanda lives from the inside out.\n\n[Editor\u2019s note: This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.]\n\nThe Root: Is this moment of African Americans connecting to Africa sustainable?\n\nPhoto: Boston University\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLinda Heywood: There always this need for more Africa, from W.E.B. Du Bois to Martin Luther King, and ... then you have the 1957 Ghana independence; that was the first step. In the 1980s and \u201990s, Africa kind of went underground in a certain way because the image we were seeing of Africa [was] so negative. So it\u2019s like this is a reawakening of the connection to Africa. I think that\u2019s excellent, but we need to sustain it.\n\nGina Paige: The entire community has benefited from the impact of Black Panther promoting pride in being of African descent. As more people want to celebrate their Africanness, they naturally want to find their own \u201cWakanda.\u201d We have seen an increased interest in people wanting to know which African country and tribe or ethnic group they share ancestry with.\n\nTR: How does finding your ancestry help with connecting to the continent?\n\nLH: There\u2019s a deep family connection [in finding your DNA]. People need to know they are connected to something. If you think, \u201cOh, I\u2019m the descendant of slaves,\u201d then you think, \u201cOh, I\u2019m not connected to anything,\u201d because slavery was a temporary status that went on far too long.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGP: African Americans want to connect with Africa because our histories were stolen from us through bondage. As a result of the trans-Atlantic slave trade, we lost our names, our languages, the freedom to honor our ancestors, and our families were sold apart. You cannot know who you are if you don\u2019t have any of those things. We don\u2019t know where we are from, and we cannot use genealogy records to find out. You cannot know who you are if you don\u2019t know where you are from.\n\nTR: How can we expect to feel knowing our biological background?\n\nLH: Why should we be always connected to slavery? We have to make our own interpretation. Don\u2019t let people put on us that status. Connecting to Africa is one way, but it\u2019s not the way out.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: African Ancestry\n\nGP: People feel all sorts of emotions upon receiving their results. They are overwhelmed, happy, surprised, proud, excited, curious and more. They immediately want to learn about the people and countries and share the information with their family members.\n\nTR: How can children learn more about Africa?\n\nLH: Not many students are learning about Africa. We have to get in those images. Not just for Black History Month. Not just Martin Luther King and Malcolm X. Junior high schoolers need to be brought into Africa in more realistic ways so that we have not just creative stories, but bring in the stories of real people who had to make real decisions and make choices. Rulers, whether they are female or male, have to make choices, and we have those elements for Europe. Let us have more for Africa. Teachers have to be able to put that into the curriculum.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: Where can the average adult start learning about the history of Africa?\n\nLH: Start by reading biographies. Be realistic in how you look at your African past history, your heroes and heroines. For men, there\u2019s Shaka Zulu (South Africa), Mansa Musa (West African Mali empire) and Asantehene (Ghana). For women, there\u2019s Nana Yaa Asantewaa (Ghana), Queen Amina (Nigeria), Queen Njinga (Angola).\n\nGP: Ethnic groups are extremely important to knowing who we are because they are the social factors that dictate culture. The top five tribes for African Americans are Fulani, Mende, Balanta, Yoruba and Tikar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: Beyond history, how else can we live our best Wakanda life in America?\n\nLH: We have to travel outside of the United States: Senegal, Ghana, Angola, Zambia, South Africa, Tanzania, Zanzibar. There are lots of sites in Africa. This is where the deep history is.\n\nGP: Take an African Ancestry test, travel, research; reading, listening to music; meet people from Africa who live in the United States; attend festivals; watch documentaries and films produced in African countries.

After an hour and a half, I emerged with a tiny Egyptian cross etched between my least favorite parts of my body\u2014my breasts. It was a daily reminder not to ignore them and to finally start to embrace them. It\u2019s safe to say I felt like Rihanna standing in the bathroom mirror post-shower, angling my phone to take the ever popular \u201csexy bathroom-mirror\u201d pic. That picture is also still in my phone.\n\n\n\nThe few times I attempted to post it on Instagram, or TwitPic it, I decided against it. Truthfully, I was afraid. I feared that after posting, I would certainly be called a thot or receive a few \u201cR U OK?\u201d text messages. I convinced myself that I didn\u2019t have to be the needy millennial stereotype that uses social media to seek validation. I was convinced that my photo would be labeled just another thirst trap that served no other purpose than to call attention to myself.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut if we define body positivity as a movement dedicated to embracing all bodies, we aren\u2019t always talking about the ones fully clothed. What you send to future bae or post online on a Thirst Trap Thursday is a form of activism. Yes, activism. This is also why we need thirst traps online; they help shape a more inclusive narrative about body positivity and can inspire other women of color to act in ways that are liberating on their terms.\n\nCollectively, we\u2019ve been trained to believe that openly sexual women pose a threat to social movements and, therefore, should be kept separate. This is why you are more likely to see people call Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201cBad Blood\u201d video a feminist battle cry and write off Nicki Minaj\u2019s opinion on why \u201cAnaconda\u201d wasn\u2019t nominated at the MTV Video Music Awards as divisive. Minaj critiqued how black women\u2019s bodies are hypersexualized or shamed, but the focus was how she chose to address it. However, it is women like Minaj and Amber Rose who push the envelope enough to start the right conversations.\n\nWhen a woman isn\u2019t so famous, their nudes may not get the same level of admiration that fame grants. But with a simple search of body-positive hashtags like #CelebrateMySize, you can find solid examples of why activism can and should be provocative. Not only did this hashtag tackle body positivity in a very personal way, but many women posted photos of themselves that could easily be posted on a #WCW or be considered a thirst trap.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsider sex coach and advocate Tyomi Morgan. By simply embracing her body, she\u2019s empowering and teaching others how to do the same:\n\nBut according to Morgan, there is a clear difference between a thirst trap and body positivity. In a brief email, she defined thirst trap as \u201c[a] photo or post that is placed on one\u2019s social media page with the intention of eliciting a response from potential partners or paying patrons.\u201d However, a thirst trap\u2019s ability to pull people in is how Morgan creates dialogue about sensuality.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very aware of how people are drawn in by the naked body, and I use my posts as a way to grab attention, and once I have it, I follow up with a meaningful message with the intent of enlightening, inspiring and encouraging,\u201d she said.\n\nTo Melanie Ennis, the term \u201cthirst trap\u201d is \u201cdripping with misogyny\u201d because it is usually used as a tool to shame women online. Ennis viewed the difference between a thirst trap and a body-positive post as being more about our inability to accept women\u2019s liberation on their terms.\n\n\u201cWhile we\u2019re taught that one is acceptable and one isn\u2019t. I think the difference between the terms is if I love my body and share it (whether I note that in the caption or not) I can\u2019t help what the viewer thirsts after,\u201d she wrote in an email.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor marginalized women, Twitter and Instagram are spaces to discuss and dismantle layers of oppression, but those women need space and acceptance to do it on their terms. And users like Ennis and Morgan are using these spaces to embrace their bodies regardless of what others deem \u201cappropriate.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d said Ennis. \u201cI do believe we are existing in a special time, and social media has a lot to do with black women being able to share our beauty, on our own terms with each other and the world.\u201d\n\nUltimately, what demotivates women trying to explore self-acceptance and liberation is slut-shaming and respectability politics. So any time a black woman has the confidence to post the most intimate parts of herself online, that is a public declaration of self-love and resistance. Instead of shaming that woman for her approach, be honest with yourself about why it annoys you or makes you uncomfortable.\n\n", "keywords": ["traps", "morgan", "thirst", "post", "social", "trap", "body", "online", "women", "positivity", "ennis", "positive"], "polarity": 0.1580094537815126, "subjectivity": 0.5149439775910365},

In the Unapologetic podcast, which Volitich hosts under the alias \u201cTiana Dalichov,\u201d Volitich brags about bringing her racist beliefs into her Crystal River Middle School classroom.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI get to talk about topics that people don\u2019t like to talk about,\u201d Volitich says in one snippet from her podcast, which HuffPost has embedded on its site. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to be seen as a bigot, racist, whatever you want to call it. I honestly don\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nThe screenshots (Volitich also posed as her \u201cTiana Dalichov\u201d alias on Twitter; her account has since been deleted, but as HuffPost knows, screenshots are forever) and podcasts reveal that Volitich certainly didn\u2019t care about being seen as a bigot\u2014in fact, she reveled in wildly racist, debunked beliefs.\n\nFrom HuffPost:\n\nIn her most recent podcast on Feb. 26, a guest railed against diversity in schools, dismissing the idea that \u201ca kid from Nigeria and a kid who came from Sweden are supposed to learn exactly the same\u201d and have the \u201csame IQ.\u201d Volitich enthusiastically agreed with the guest, and went on to argue that \u201cscience\u201d has proven that certain races are smarter than others.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLater in the episode, Volitich also agreed that white supremacists need to infiltrate schools:\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have to be vocal about their views, but get in there!\u201d her guest said. \u201cBe more covert and just start taking over those places.\u201d \u201cRight,\u201d Volitich said. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely one of them.\u201d\n\nAfter the HuffPost story came out, WFTS-TV in Tampa Bay found another article published on the far-right news site Halsey News under the headline \u201cTiana Dalichov: White Privilege Challenge.\u201d In it, Dalichov prompted people to write arguments proving \u201cone single instance of white privilege,\u201d for which she would give them $100.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHuffPost pieced together that Volitich was actually \u201cDalichov\u201d by lining up a series of coincidences. \u201cDalichov\u201d listed her home as Crystal River, which matches public records for Volitich\u2019s home. \u201cDalichov\u201d has shared on her podcast that she\u2019s a schoolteacher who has been teaching at her current school for one year. The same was true for Volitich and her position at Crystal River. \u201cDalichov\u201d tweeted that she was 25 years old, which is Volitich\u2019s age. And after HuffPost reached out to the Citrus County School District about Volitich, \u201cDalichov\u201d mentioned on her Twitter account that she would be going dark for a while.\n\n\n\nBut perhaps the clearest evidence is that Volitich, presumably part of the race that has higher IQs than others, posted an actual picture of herself as the avatar for her \u201cDalichov\u201d Twitter account. As HuffPost notes, not only does it appear to be the same person, but Volitich is also wearing the same earrings in her Twitter photo as she is in the Crystal River Middle School website.\n\nThe most disturbing part of HuffPost\u2019s revelations is that Volitch was consciously indoctrinating her students. As the article notes, the middle school social studies teacher says that her students knew her political beliefs and even helped \u201cplay along\u201d with administrators to help hide them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom one of her podcasts, according to WFTS-TV:\n\n\u201cI told the kids that. I said guys when they are in here I\u2019m going to be different than I usually am. I just don\u2019t want you to be shocked, I want you to play along and they\u2019re like OK. OK,\u201d she said in the podcast.\n\nLater in the podcast, after Volitich\u2019s guest asks her if the kids ever told their parents what they learned in class, she confirms that the principal once followed up with her over an email a parent had sent:\n\n\u201cI had one at the beginning of this year who emailed the principal over my head and basically told her I\u2019m worried that your teacher is injecting political bias into her teaching. And the principal came to me and she was like I\u2019m not worried, should I be worried? And I was like no. And she believed me and she backed off.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNearly 90 percent of Crystal River Middle School is white. The city of Crystal River itself is over 80 percent white, according to the latest census, with black people making up just over 7 percent of the population. Latinx residents account for another 5 percent.\n\n\n\nAs the HuffPost article notes, this isn\u2019t the first high-profile outing of a teacher\u2019s white nationalist identity. Late last year, Splinter News revealed that Greg Conte, a white supremacist who worked for Richard Spencer\u2019s think tank, the National Policy Institute, had gotten a job as an equal-employment officer. He also worked as a substitute teacher at a private high school in Maryland.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd in Louisiana, the principal of a charter school in New Orleans was fired after he was found wearing Nazi-associated rings in a video. He had also appeared on white nationalist podcasts.\n\nSince the story broke, people from around the country have taken to social media to demand that the school district fire Volitich. Neither the Citrus County School District, of which Crystal River is a part, nor Volitich has confirmed the HuffPost story, though the school has told the site that it \u201cwill be looking into the statements she made, checking the validity to see if they violate our code of ethics and policy.\u201d\n\n", "keywords": ["crystal", "river", "supremacist", "huffpost", "volitich", "teacher", "middle", "white", "florida", "dalichov", "podcast", "dont", "school", "outed", "unapologetic"], "polarity": 0.06521878121878123, "subjectivity": 0.31108824508824506},

I have the same profile picture on all of my social media accounts and on every author page on the sites I write for.

Now it would include teachers.\n\n\u201cIt bothers me to think, as a father of two young boys, to tell them to not be aggressive to your teacher,\u201d Braynon said, according to the Sun-Sentinel. \u201cPlease don\u2019t make it dangerous for children who look like my children to go to school.\u201d\n\nHis colleagues in the Florida state Senate didn\u2019t seem to be listening.\n\nA half-dozen Democratic amendments for gun reform were voted down at the Florida Legislature on Monday, including the reform most sought-after by Parkland, Fla., student activists: a ban on all assault weapons. Instead, lawmakers approved proposals that included raising the age limit on firearm sales from 18 to 21, banning the sale of bump stocks and enacting the Florida sheriff\u2019s Marshal Program, which would allow educators to carry firearms in school.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Sun-Sentinel outlines the particulars of the controversial program:\n\nThose who elect to participate in the program would have to go through 132 hours of training after a background check, psychological exam and drug screening. Both a school district superintendent and a county sheriff can prevent anyone from participating in the program for any reason.\ufeff\n\n\n\nMany have spoken out against arming educators for the inherent safety risks it poses, especially in armed-shooter situations. On Twitter, Charlotte Clymer compiled a thread of reactions from concerned gun owners and war veterans about the proposed law:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe thread included an excerpt from a New York Times article featuring former Marine sniper and author of the memoir Jarhead, Anthony Swofford.\n\nCalling any proposal to arm teachers \u201cabsurd,\u201d Swofford imagined a scenario in which a high school coach with a handgun would have to face down a student armed with an assault rifle:\n\nMore likely ... he would not have been able to draw his weapon (a side arm, presumably) quickly enough to stop the shooter, who with an an AR-15 would have had the coach outgunned. Even if the coach had been able to draw his weapon\u2014from where? his athletic shorts?\u2014any shots he managed to fire would have risked being errant, possibly injuring or killing additional students. As some studies have shown, even police officers have missed their targets more than 50 percent of the time. In firing a weapon, [the coach] would have only added to the carnage and confusion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut as Jamelle Bouie noted in a recent Slate article, school shootings are still, thankfully, a relatively rare phenomenon. What is not rare\u2014and what has been quantified in myriad ways throughout the years\u2014is racial bias in classrooms. And as Sen. Braynon implied, the Marshal Program, by introducing guns into environments where students of color are disciplined at disturbingly disproportionate rates, is much more likely to harm students than it is to save lives.\n\nAs Bouie wrote, black, Latinx and Native American students are most likely to face harsh in-school discipline, despite not being any more likely to misbehave than their white counterparts. Bouie includes a number of data points to back this up, including this striking example: a 2011 study that found that 32 percent of black students were suspended for a first-time offense of using a cellphone at school. Their white peers were suspended at a rate of 15 percent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAt all ages, black and Latino children are viewed as more dangerous and unruly, regardless of actual behavior,\u201d Bouie wrote\u2014and in reading this passage, it\u2019s difficult not to recall the image of a school police officer pulling a black girl from her desk and slamming her to the ground. From teachers to administrators to law enforcement officers, schools have not hesitated to dole out the most severe punishments to students of color.\n\nAnd now firearms may be an option.\n\nThis is perhaps the most disturbing fact: There is no age at which students of color are truly protected. Yale research suggests that racial bias exists among preschool teachers. In one study conducted by the university, preschool teachers were asked to watch video clips of children in classrooms and scan for \u201cchallenging behavior.\u201d The jig? None of the clips contained challenging behaviors. Nevertheless, researchers found that the teachers, scanning for signs of trouble, spent more time looking at black children than white children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe group they spent the most time watching? Black boys.\n\nIt isn\u2019t difficult to imagine what could happen in a high school classroom when an armed teacher, however \u201cwell-intentioned,\u201d anticipates challenging or dangerous behavior from a black student. For that matter, how do we expect our students to behave knowing that their teachers are armed? (And having worked in a school, I can promise you, students will find out which teachers are.)\n\nThe proposed bill in Florida also allows school district superintendents and county sheriffs to bar educators from participating in the program, thus introducing another entry point for an individual\u2019s implicit bias to determine which teachers and administrators get approved and which don\u2019t. It is hard to imagine a scenario in which black educators are approved to be armed at the same rate as their white peers.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut even if that were equal, there remains the final paradox: The educators rushing to get approved to bring firearms to school are the ones who have no business around your children. Ashley Nicole Black, a writer for Full Frontal with Samantha Bee, put it succinctly in one tweet:\n\n\n\n\u201cAll I can picture is every racist teacher who lashed out at me verbally or physically over the years and what would have happened if that person had a gun?\u201d Black wrote. \u201cYeah, there are more good, kind, teachers... but they\u2019re not gonna be the ones signing up for guns.\u201d", "keywords": ["gun", "teachers", "forward", "moving", "especially", "program", "armed", "dangerous", "florida", "black", "children", "laws", "approved", "school", "legislature", "educators", "schools", "students"], "polarity": 0.07754769921436586, "subjectivity": 0.5443712254823364},

The bill would grant a means to citizenship to undocumented young people brought to the U.S. as children.\n\nThe date Trump randomly gave was March 5. In January, Trump refused to sign a bipartisan DACA bill because it didn\u2019t include tax monies for his dumbass border wall no one wants. (Yes, this is the same border wall Trump swore Mexico was going to pay for.) Then Trump started picking fights with everyone else, and DACA fell by the wayside. In turn, the status of some 800,000 immigrants remains in limbo.\n\nTrump, of course, has blamed Democrats for DACA inaction, charging that they \u201care doing nothing\u201d about the issue, according to the New York Daily News.\n\nMass shootings in Las Vegas and Florida took the attention off DACA as Trump had to work tirelessly to make sure no one upset the National Rifle Association.

The meal included ribs, collard greens, and mac and cheese, along with Kool-Aid and watermelon-flavored water.\n\nIn the statement, GCOMMS clarified that two Aramark employees who were fired by the food service provider as a result of the incident were a general manager and head cook, and that both are white. The student organization also said that the supervisors \u201cattempted to place the blame on black cooks by saying that the cooks created the menu.\u201d\n\nGCOMMS said it was unacceptable that the blame be placed upon those cooks, but also wrote that no student or student organization desired or demanded that the Aramark employees be fired. The statement also added that the students who inquired about the meal were lied to about who had made the meal and what could be done about it.\n\nThe group also addressed criticism that students\u2019 problem with the meal showed that they were ashamed to eat soul flood, or that they were classist and too preoccupied with what white people might think of them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe issue is that we attend an institution that constantly ignores the voices of black students and works based upon preconceived stereotypes,\u201d the group wrote, adding that no black students were consulted about the menu.\n\n\u201cWe understand the importance of soul food, as many of us are born and raised in Southern homes, however, we take issue when these decisions are made by white managers, from a company that profits off of private prisons,\u201d GCOMMS wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinally, citing attacks on two students who had complained about the meal, GCOMMS blamed news outlets for manipulating the students\u2019 words \u201cto create speculation that black cooks were fired.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a shame that students once again must do the labor of correcting a false narrative,\u201d the group wrote in the Twitter copy that accompanied the letter. \u201cHowever we will not sit idly and allow this to happen.\u201d\n\nEarlier:\n\nIt was the choice of drinks that bothered New York University sophomore Nia Harris the most.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Tuesday, Harris noticed an \u201cinteresting\u201d Black History Month-themed menu at one of NYU\u2019s dining halls. On deck was a selection of soul food: ribs, collard greens, cornbread, and mac and cheese. But what she found most striking was the choice of beverage: Kool-Aid and watermelon-flavored water, two drinks with strong racial connotations and histories.\n\nIt was enough to provoke the 19-year-old Harris to ask who was behind the menu.\n\nAs Harris would write in a Facebook post that was widely shared, and as the New York Times reported, after seeking an explanation and being \u201cbounced around\u201d (Harris\u2019 words), she finally spoke to the head cook of Weinstein Passport Dining Hall. After voicing her concerns about the meal, the cook explained that the Kool-Aid was actually fruit punch and that it wasn\u2019t unusual for the dining hall to serve fruit-infused water. The cook also said that the two employees who had planned the meal were black.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn her Facebook post and letter to the NYU administration, Harris pointed out that \u201cfruit punch\u201d drinks were available from the soda fountain, and so it was curious that this drink was differentiated\u2014she added that a cook told another student that the drink was, in fact, Kool-Aid. She also noted that watermelon had never appeared before in the flavored water, and that it was out of season.\n\n\u201cNot only was this racially insensitive, this was just ignorant,\u201d Harris wrote, adding that in 2018, there was \u201cno excuse for intentional and deliberate disrespect.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe also recounted how an operations manager asked, \u201cAre you offended or something?\u201d when confronted about the menu.\n\nNYU President Andrew Hamilton released a statement within a day of Harris\u2019 email. As the Times reports, Hamilton called the Black History Month meal \u201cinexcusably insensitive.\u201d The menu had been chosen by two employees of Aramark, a food service provider, both of whom have since been fired, according to the Times.\n\nIn the statement, Hamilton also noted the damage was \u201ccompounded by the insensitivity of the replies\u201d to Harris\u2019 concerns. The NYU president said that no school officials were offered input on the meals, and that going forward, any menu for special events ought to be run by the \u201cexisting student advisory body and campus cultural groups.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn her original email, Harris wrote that it was inexcusable for NYU \u201cto claim to be a \u2018diverse\u2019 and \u2018global\u2019 university and just to ignore this.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you [want] to learn how to celebrate black history and culture during this month, you can ask black students at this school instead of patronizing us with Kool-Aid, watermelon and ribs,\u201d Harris wrote.\n\n\n\nThe incident, though high-profile, is far from isolated: Many of the students who shared Harris\u2019 posts offered up their own horror stories of racist Black History Month meals on their campuses, the New York Post noted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHarris considers Hamilton\u2019s statement and the firing of the employees a \u201cvictory,\u201d she told the Times in an interview Wednesday. Still, she says that if she had not publicized the incident, the university wouldn\u2019t have felt pressured to \u201cdo the right thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe burden of teaching people how to be respectful to [black students] is falling on us,\u201d Harris told the Times.", "keywords": ["racially", "student", "month", "group", "white", "insensitive", "history", "employees", "harris", "wrote", "black", "university", "meal", "students", "fired", "statement"], "polarity": 0.04836169577548888, "subjectivity": 0.502017092103299},

Now she\u2019s bracing for the prospect of being deported to a country that is essentially foreign to her.\n\n\u201cJust being a black woman in America already is challenging,\u201d she said. \u201cBeing a black person in America is challenging. Adding undocumented on top of that is a double whammy.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s move to rescind DACA also reminds Mwewa Sumbwe of what it means to live in the United States as an undocumented black woman. She came to America from Zambia with her parents when she was just 4 years old and settled in Silver Spring, Md. She attends school at the University of Maryland and wants to start her own business some day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeing black in America in general is a daily process of walking on the eggshells of white supremacy, but being undocumented adds another layer of racial aggression.\n\nAs the Daily Beast reports, people who are stopped by cops are subject to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers being alerted to their arrest because the Department of Homeland Security has said that ICE can use DACA information to deport people under arrest. And, as we know, black people are much more likely than members of any other group to be stopped by police.\n\nFor a black person who doesn\u2019t have documentation issues, they just have to worry about an arrest. For Sumbwe, an arrest could mean deportation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEverywhere I go, I have to be suspicious of everything,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s draining because you really can\u2019t just live freely. If I am having a conversation with police or a legal authority, [I think about] how I\u2019m presenting myself. Am I speaking properly? Should I defend myself? It\u2019s this constant feeling of strategizing on how to survive.\u201d\n\nWhile much of the attention over Trump\u2019s DACA decision has focused on Hispanic recipients, black immigrants are facing many of the consequences as well.\n\nThere are more than 575,000 black undocumented immigrants in the United States, according to the Black Alliance for Just Immigration. In its recent State of Black Immigrants report (pdf), BAJI found that the vast majority of people who took advantage of former President Barack Obama\u2019s 2012 administrative program DACA were Mexicans, at 78 percent of application-approval rates. Comparatively, only 3 percent of African immigrants and 2 percent of people of Caribbean descent were eligible for DACA, out of an eligibility pool of 1.2 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven more troubling is the fact that black undocumented immigrants are much more at risk of being deported than any other group, according to BAJI\u2019s report. While black immigrants make up just 5.4 percent of the undocumented population, they make up (pdf) 10.6 percent of immigrants in removal proceedings between 2003 and 2015.\n\nCarl Lipscombe, deputy director of BAJI, said that black immigrants are not a focal point of the DACA conversation because the program never prioritized black communities. He said that when the Obama administration marketed the program, most of the attention was tailored to Latino communities, leaving black undocumented immigrants unaware of DACA\u2019s benefits. Lipscombe has a theory as to why that was.\n\n\u201cIt really boils down to an element of white supremacy within the immigrant-rights movement that preferences light-skinned people,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen over the past 20 years in the mainstream immigrant-rights movement is this focus on integration and assimilation. But when they\u2019re talking about integrating and assimilating into the U.S., they\u2019re not talking about assimilating into black America. They\u2019re talking about immigrating into white America and having that white picket fence and go[ing] to the Ivy League schools and start[ing] a business. All of those things are dog whistles against African Americans, who are stereotyped as being uneducated and lazy.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBesides the racial component of being black and undocumented, there is also the issue of challenging the notion of faulting parents for bringing their children to America to enjoy a better future.\n\nJonathan Jayes-Green, co-founder of the UndocuBlack Network, a national organization that supports black immigrants and helps amplify their stories, is careful not to stigmatize his parents for bringing him to the United States from Panama.\n\n\u201cOur immigration system isn\u2019t meant for people to immigrate legally, unless you are privileged or from a particular country,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are literally paths for people that are less likely to be black or poor. That part of the conversation gets lost when people say, \u2018Oh, all of these young people came here through no fault of their own.\u2019 I am not here for faulting my parents. I think they made an incredibly brave choice to move to this country to pursue what they believed to be the American dream, but also not knowing all of the consequences that would come with them making that choice.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndeed, America immigration laws have a long history of racism. Whether it was capping Chinese immigration during the 1800s, limiting the number of Eastern European Jews entering the country with a 1924 congressional act or putting Japanese-American citizens in internment camps during World War II, America has always targeted nonwhite and/or non-Christian people as dangers to American whiteness. Trump is just resurrecting old racist policies with his own 2017 version, namely his recent order that essentially functions as a Muslim ban.\n\nWe also see racism in American immigration laws when wealthy Russians\u2014who come from a country that America\u2019s intelligence community agrees meddled in the 2016 presidential election\u2014are able to travel freely to the U.S. and make babies on Trump properties with the sole purpose of gaining U.S citizenship for them.\n\nSumbwe knows all too well the racial hypocrisy of immigration in America, which is why she refuses to hide in fear. America needs to know that she exists. As far as Sumbwe is concerned, she is exhibit A of why America\u2019s immigration policy needs to be fixed. And she says no one is better suited to explain why than she is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf I don\u2019t tell my story, someone else will,\u201d Sumbwe said. \u201cAnd they will tell it wrong, and that happens all the time. It\u2019s necessary for us to tell our stories because many people don\u2019t get that immigration is a black issue and that we exist. So it is voicing for people who are still afraid.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if she is worried about deportation or being so outspoken about her DACA status, Oweh admits that it is always on her mind, but it will not stop her from sharing her story. Congress, America, everyone needs to hear about how unjust Trump\u2019s DACA action is\u2014even if that puts her on the feds\u2019 radar.\n\n\u201cOf course I\u2019m scared about that, but I\u2019m not the one who lives in fear,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel that what is for me is for me. And if that means not being in America, that\u2019s my destiny, but I would like to be in America. America is all I know. America is all I\u2019ve grown up in.

Lena Horne had wanted to be a school teacher, joining the ranks of teachers in her own family. Life took her in a different direction.

The news sparked outrage and a rally by the National Action Network on Monday to protest Catania\u2019s actions.\n\n\n\nWith the spotlight on her, more dirt is being uncovered.\n\nThe New York Daily News reports that the embattled principal, who\u2019s still at her post at Intermediate School 224 in New York City\u2019s Bronx borough, has deepened a rift between herself and students and staff after confiscating a student poster of Lena Horne.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwo students created the poster for English teacher Mercedes Liriano-Clark\u2014the same teacher who was prevented from teaching the Harlem Renaissance lesson.\n\nAccording to students and staff, Catania took the poster from an 11-year-old sixth-grader. It was intended to be used as a visual aid for a class presentation. Catania took the poster from the child without explanation. The incident left the child in tears.\n\nFrom the Daily News:\n\n\u201cShe was like, \u2018Oh I\u2019m gonna take it upstairs,\u2019\u201d the girl told the News. \u201cShe ran inside her office and wouldn\u2019t give it back to me. She don\u2019t like me \u2019cause I like Miss Liriano.\u201d\ufeff\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCatania later gave the poster back to the child, still without giving any reason for having taken it in the first place.\n\nLiriano-Clark says she doesn\u2019t know what could have provoked Catania to take the poster.\n\n\u201cIf she has a personal vendetta against me, let it be towards me and not towards the children,\u201d Liriano-Clark told the Daily News. \u201cThe fact that she took kids\u2019 work and hid it in her office, I don\u2019t know why she would do that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the wake of the news, former staffers are corroborating I.S. 224\u2019s accounts that Catania had targeted and silenced black and Latinx staff while serving as principal at another school, University Neighborhood High School.\n\nA letter written by former staffers to the city Education Department in 2013 states that \u201cit is an open secret that the majority of the University Neighborhood High School African-American staff does not have a voice and are targeted for excess.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Daily News, the letter then details \u201ca list of \u2018actual incidents indicative of prejudice against Afro-Americans and Hispanics at University Neighborhood High School,\u2019 including acts by Catania.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials for the Education Department told the Daily News that the claims were investigated but were ultimately determined to be unfounded.

However, Volitich, who ran the show under the pseudonym \u201cTiana Dalichov,\u201d claims that the whole thing was satire.\n\nWFLA-TV, an ABC News affiliate, published a statement it says was provided to the station on Volitich\u2019s behalf. It reads:\n\nNone of the statements released about my being a white nationalist or white supremacist have any truth to them, nor are my political beliefs injected into my teaching of social studies curriculum. While operating under the Russian pseudonym \u201cTiana Dalichov\u201d on social media and the Unapologetic Podcast, I employed political satire and exaggeration, mainly to the end of attracting listeners and followers, and generating conversation about the content discussed between myself and my guests.

As an adult, my decisions are my own, and my family has nothing whatsoever to do with my social media accounts or my podcast. From them, I humbly ask for forgiveness, as it was never my intention to cause them grief while engaging in a hobby on my personal time. All future questions about the current situation should be directed to my attorney. I cannot comment further, due to the ongoing school board investigation.\n\nVolitich, on top of hosting the podcast, also ran a Twitter and Goodreads account under the Dalichov pseudonym and, according to WFTS-TV, appears to have contributed to \u201calt-right\u201d websites like Halsey News under that name as well.\n\nWhich is to say, Volitich developed an entire brand out of her Dalichov alias\u2014a hell of a commitment to satire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s a (nonexhaustive and incomplete) recap of Volitich\u2019s satirical hot takes and anecdotes, all of which are things she either directly tweeted or stated on her podcast:\n\nEmphatically agreed with a guest who dismissed the idea that a kid from Nigeria and a kid from Sweden could \u201clearn the same\u201d and have the \u201csame IQ.\u201d\n\nArgued that science proves certain races are more intelligent than others.\n\nRecounted a story about her principal following up with her about a parent complaint that she had injected political bias into her teaching.\n\nAdmitted she had lied to the principal and said the claim \u201cwasn\u2019t true.\u201d\n\nTweeted that America\u2019s education system \u201cis designed to enable victimization when teachers are forced to learn about institutional racism.\u201d\n\nAgreed with a guest that white supremacists need to infiltrate schools and become teachers and said, \u201cI\u2019m absolutely one of them.\u201d\n\nTweeted that terrorism will continue unless Muslims are \u201ceradicated from the face of the earth.\u201d\n\nSaid on her podcast that she had put on a \u201cdog and pony\u201d show for administrators, telling her students that when administrators showed up, \u201cI\u2019m going to be different than I usually am.

We\u2019re going to school. We\u2019re contributing to society. And what makes me angry is that people say that we are stealing jobs from people. That\u2019s one of the things that bothers me the most because it\u2019s not true.\u201d\n\nU.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced Tuesday at the Justice Department that the Trump administration is rescinding DACA, arguing that former President Barack Obama abused his executive powers by implementing the policy. Congress now has until March 5, 2018, to figure out ways to preserve DACA protections before recipients lose their status.\n\nProtesters have already taken to the streets to protest Trump\u2019s decision, which is sure to bring anxiety to the more than 800,000 individuals who, since the program\u2019s implementation in 2012, have been living under DACA protections and are often informally referred to as Dreamers, a reference to the related, but never passed, DREAM Act that would have provided protections similar to DACA.\n\nHundreds of thousands of young people have been able to live and work in the United States legally since the administrative program was implemented. Eligibility for DACA is strict. Applicants cannot have a criminal record and must have arrived in the country before 2007 at no older than 16 years of age. Recipients must reapply every two years to stay active.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDACA is not a path to citizenship. Moreover, even though DACA recipients pay taxes, they do not see the benefits of those tax dollars. They cannot vote, nor are they eligible for federal grants, aid or student loans for college, according to the U.S. Department of Education.\n\nAccording to the Black Alliance for Just Immigration, there are more than 575,000 undocumented black immigrants in the United States, but many do not benefit from programs such as DACA. Opal Tometi, BAJI\u2019s executive director and co-founder of Black Lives Matter Global Network, condemned Trump\u2019s actions in a statement soon after Sessions\u2019 remarks.\n\n\u201cBy canceling the program, President Trump is yet again pandering to white supremacists over immigrant, black and poor communities, as well as millions of organizations, businesses and allies that support DACA recipients,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is now up to Congress to come up with a long-term solution to our broken immigration system that protects human rights and enables immigrant families to live and thrive in the U.S.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCarla, who moved to Maryland with her family from Peru when she was 5 years old, says that she isn\u2019t surprised by Sessions\u2019 announcement because of how Trump stereotyped undocumented immigrants throughout his campaign.\n\n\u201cLook who they elected as president. They love treating anyone who is not white as a second-class citizen,\u201d said Carla, who declined to give her full name for fear of being reported to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. \u201cYou can see how they treat blacks and Hispanics. Literally, anyone who is not white.

More than $280 billion in loss in economic growth could also follow.\n\nTo ease the concerns of DACA recipients, Sergio C. Garcia, a lawyer with his own practice in Chino, Calif., posted on Facebook that he would assist DACA recipients with questions about their status.\n\nGarcia is especially qualified to take on this issue. Back in 2012, he passed the bar on the first try but was not able to practice because he was undocumented. In 2014 the California Supreme Court ruled that he was allowed to practice law in the state, even though federal law precluded any public or private entity from hiring him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe told The Root in a phone interview that DACA recipients should brace for lots of uncertainty during the next six months as Congress wrestles with how to address the Trump administration\u2019s move.\n\n\u201cWe can still fight this and appeal to Congress to do the right thing and protect them before the six-month run,\u201d he said. \u201cBut also to just being cautiously optimistic because Congress has never gotten it together. That\u2019s the reason why Obama had to issue the executive order to begin with because Congress couldn\u2019t come together on a DREAM Act in the past.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump, however, is not making it easier for Garcia and activists to protect people living under DACA. The Daily Beast reports that the White House is instructing ICE officers to use DACA information, such as home addresses, place of work and school, to deport them:\n\nIn a memo, the Department of Homeland Security answered this question. And its statement\u2014full of wordy legalese\u2014made clear that Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers will be able to use DACA recipients\u2019 personal information to deport them. \u201cInformation provided to USCIS in DACA requests will not be proactively provided to ICE and CBP for the purpose of immigration enforcement proceedings, unless the requestor meets the criteria for the issuance of a Notice To Appear or a referral to ICE under the criteria set forth in USCIS\u2019 Notice to Appear guidance,\u201d said the statement. In other words, USCIS (United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, the agency which handles DACA) won\u2019t proactively give immigration enforcement officers a list with the names and addresses of all DACA recipients. But if ICE officers ask for it, the agency will provide it. \u201cThey\u2019re saying we will not give your information unless ICE tells USCIS they need it to deport you, which basically means we\u2019ll give your information out whenever ICE says it\u2019s necessary to deport you,\u201d said Leon Fresco, an immigration attorney who represents many DACA recipients. \u201cThat\u2019s the point.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs grim as the DHS memo is, politicians, tech companies and even celebrities have vowed to defend DACA recipients:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCarla, the University of Maryland student, is still processing everything.

This time I thought we\u2019d talk about this whole immigration issue and the debate surrounding it.\n\nSure! I once had a job analyzing the economic impact of immigration, so this subject is right in my wheelhouse. I also worked at Arby\u2019s, so if you ever need to know the difference between a half-ounce of roast beef and a full ounce, I could help you with that, too.\n\nLet\u2019s stick to the immigration debate for now. First of all, what the hell is this DACA thing everyone is fighting about?\n\nDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals was a policy implemented by President Barack Obama that allowed some minor immigrants, who either came to the U.S. illegally or overstayed visas, to defer their deportation for two-year periods and become eligible for work permits.\n\nSome people tried to pass a bill called the DREAM Act, but even though it had enough votes to pass in the Senate, Republicans blocked it, so Obama issued an executive action implementing the law.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo why do Republicans hate it so much?\n\nBecause Obama is black and Republicans are racist.\n\nWhy does this have to be about race?\n\nBecause there is no other explanation. The GOP accused Obama of abusing his executive powers, even though Obama\u2019s plan was similar to executive actions by Republican Presidents George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan. DACA was less lenient than Reagan\u2019s plan. The DREAM Act was written by Republicans and Democrats.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe demonization of illegal immigrants has been a tactic used to scare white people since America was founded. Whether it\u2019s terrorism, crime or the time-honored Swiss Army knife of white supremacy, \u201cAmerican Christian values,\u201d white America has used every opportunity in history to gin up fear about immigrants.\n\nIn 1798 the Alien and Sedition Acts gave the president the right to deport people \u201cdangerous to the peace and safety\u201d of the country. In 1875 the Page Act banned \u201cundesirable\u201d immigrants. The Chinese Exclusion Act, well ... I\u2019m sure you can guess what it did.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just black and brown people who were targeted. At different points in history, white people said the same thing about the Irish, the Italians and the Catholics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut those are all white people.\n\nThose people became white. You must remember, whiteness is a made-up thing. The Irish were once thought to be lazy, dumb and prone to criminal behavior The Italians were considered dumb, dirty and uncultured Neanderthals who would rape white women. They were all eventually absorbed into the American Caucasian culture after extended debates about immigration.\n\nAnd black people?\n\nI don\u2019t think anyone referred to the centuries-old practice of trans-Atlantic kidnapping as \u201cimmigration.\u201d I\u2019ve seen slave logs. We were not \u201cundocumented workers.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFair point. But what about the fact that illegal immigrants commit more crimes and acts of terrorism?\n\nThat is a great point ... except it\u2019s not true.\n\nStudy after study has shown that undocumented immigrants are less likely to engage in criminal behavior and less likely to be incarcerated than native-born Americans. In fact, the American Immigration Council reports that higher immigration is associated with lower crime rates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump even faked a Department of Homeland Security report citing the statistic that 3 out of 4 people convicted of terrorism are foreign-born, even though most acts of domestic terrorism are committed by white men.\n\nBut you have to admit that they come here and take our jobs.\n\nNot according to the Brookings Institution; the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine; and the American Action Forum. In fact, data shows that immigration increases wages and employment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut they don\u2019t pay taxes, right?\n\nHave you ever been in line at Target and heard someone tell the cashier, \u201cDon\u2019t add taxes to my groceries, I\u2019m from Mexico\u201d? Even if a worker is undocumented, an employer must deduct federal, state and local taxes from every worker\u2019s paycheck. In fact, undocumented workers pay billions in Social Security and Medicare that they will never benefit from.\n\nOK. Maybe you\u2019re right about all of those things, but you must admit there is such a thing as \u201cshithole countries.\u201d\n\nI agree with you on that point. There are some countries that do better than others. A country that incarcerated more human beings than any other on the planet could be considered a shithole. If there was a country that had the best medical care in the world but still allowed people to die because they couldn\u2019t afford to see a doctor, I\u2019d consider that a shithole. A shithole country would have homeless people in the streets and empty houses on every block. A shithole country would be the last \u201ccivilized\u201d country to outlaw slavery. A shithole would drop bombs on innocent people with robot planes. A shithole country would allow someone to lead it even though he had no demonstrable qualifications.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut if all of these things are true, then why are people so up in arms about illegal immigration?\n\nBecause ... white people.\n\nWhite people? That\u2019s not really an answer.\n\nMaybe I should pretend we\u2019re playing Jeopardy and put my answer in the form of a question.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWho waltzed onto the shores of America and declared that an already inhabited land now belonged to them? Who slaughtered their way across a whole continent and called the residents \u201csavages\u201d? Who justified relocating an entire indigenous population to \u201creservations\u201d through trickery, threats and good old-fashioned genocide? Who rounded up its citizens of Japanese heritage and herded them into concentration camps? Who refers to Muslims as terrorists, Mexicans as rapists and black people as thieves while raping, terrorizing and stealing an entire continent?\n\nHere\u2019s the bigger question: Who prances around the globe digging holes, shits in the holes and then has the audacity to slander the place where they dumped their waste as a \u201cshithole\u201d?\n\nWhite people?\n\nYou should\u2019ve made your question a true Daily Double.\n\nWhether you refer to it as colonization, reappropriation, gentrification or \u201cmanifest destiny,\u201d their specific brand of treachery has always been the great American modus operandi. It has nothing to do with criminality, terrorism or the economy. They fear immigration because they worry that America will become a nonwhite country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt its core, their anti-immigrant sentiment is less about hate and more about insecurity and fear. They\u2019ve seen how minorities are treated, and they assume that everyone else is filled with as much black-hearted evil as they are, so they create slogans like \u201cDiversity equals white genocide,\u201d \u201cYou will not replace us\u201d and \u201cMake America great again.\u201d\n\nWhat will happen if their efforts are successful?\n\nIf the Donald Trump Ethnic Cleansing Plan succeeds, they will have reversed the thing that made this country a superpower in the first place. This nation was built by black, Latino and Muslim hands. Whites have been the main beneficiaries, but they didn\u2019t do it by themselves. A white ethno-state might be their ultimate goal, but it won\u2019t be America.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, what will we call it?\n\nA shithole country.", "keywords": ["shithole", "american", "thing", "america", "explained", "immigrants", "immigration", "white", "hate", "undocumented", "country", "black"], "polarity": 0.0608007733007733, "subjectivity": 0.38479175145841815},

Then she stepped on the students\u2019 backs, allegedly to show them \u201chow it feels to be a slave.\u201d This was not the first time that Patricia Cummings, who is white, had \u201ctaught\u201d this module on the Middle Passage, when Africans were forcibly brought to America as part of the slave trade.\n\n\n\nAnd while this was the first incident of its kind coming from the school, the same article also mentioned that in 2013, two teachers from Manhattan\u2019s Public School 59 had incorporated the killing and whipping of slaves into a math lesson on subtraction and multiplication.\n\nCummings\u2019 slavery lesson wasn\u2019t only cruel, it was redundant. Black students already know what it\u2019s like to be dominated.\n\nNear Pittsburgh, Woodland Hills High School Principal Kevin Murray was caught on video holding a student\u2019s head down while a school resource officer (a police officer who is stationed in a school to provide security) shocked the child with a stun gun.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nForcing students to walk along lines painted on the floor became an industry standard among charter-management organizations in black districts until the Southern Poverty Law Center and the U.S. Department of Justice threatened to file lawsuits for unnecessarily harsh discipline, among other complaints.\n\nIn addition, black districts are treated like black students. For instance, states\u2019 departments of education used the extreme tool of state takeover\u2014whereby states take control of an entire school district\u2014disproportionately against black districts. Consequently, black students quickly became familiar with strategies such as firing black workforces.\n\nBlack students know too well what it\u2019s like to be humiliated and held in captivity and to suffer from inhumane conditions created by educators. Many compliant students who sit quietly accepting demeaning lessons like the ones administered by Cummings and others like her are viewed as obedient and law-abiding. Their counterparts who resist are deemed disorderly and are subjected to harsh disciplinary policies, often ending up in jail by way of the school-to-prison pipeline.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhether you are obedient or \u201cwoke\u201d\u2014conscious of your oppression\u2014you are being oppressed in schools. Yep, black students already know what it\u2019s like to be stepped on.\n\nYou would think that reading slave narratives and perspectives from the enslaved about the horror of being sold into slavery and held in captivity would encourage a connection with the past. Born in Slavery: Slave Narratives From the Federal Writers\u2019 Project, 1936-1938, which was sponsored by the Library of Congress, is a great resource for teachers and students to learn from those who were enslaved\u2014and who, by the way, were among the ancestors of the students. But I stand corrected. There are white teachers like Cummings who have not reckoned with what it means to oppress.\n\nCummings has since been reassigned away from children. The New York City Education Department should throw her out of the district, with assistance from the union. But firing one teacher won\u2019t begin a reckoning among teachers of what it means to be an oppressor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTeachers, ask yourself, what does it feel like to oppress? What emotional boost do you gain from tormenting black and brown youths with absurd \u201clessons\u201d that scrutinize the enslaved and ignore the oppressors?\n\nAnd how has the institution of slavery affected attitudes of teachers today? The disproportionate use of suspension and corporal punishment against black kids reflects our socially ingrained perceptions. The belief that teachers (and parents) are justified in punishing black children in order for them to learn stems from our racist past.\n\nEducation can progress if teachers become more self-aware and cognizant of how they beat down black children and their families. Teachers, what do you get out of blaming black parents for underachieving kids and shaming students about their nappy hair and saggy pants?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsk yourselves why you handle black kids in ways you would never treat your own children.\n\nColleges of education and teacher-certification programs must do more to address the psychological bases of racism, patriarchy and white privilege. And, yes (for those who are quick to add that black teachers are racist, too), black teachers must address internalized racism as well.\n\nThere is evidence that racism is a psychological defense mechanism generated by feelings of insecurity and anxiety.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cResearch has shown that when people are given reminders of their own mortality, they feel a sense of anxiety and insecurity, which they respond to by becoming more prone to status-seeking, materialism, greed, prejudice and aggression,\u201d writes psychologist Steven Taylor in the industry magazine Psychology Today.\n\nInsecurities can result in a destructive mindset that leads to a projection of flaws and personal failings onto another group as a strategy of avoiding responsibility and blame.\n\nBut clearly, racism comes from more than widespread insecurities about mortality; greater than a kind of midlife racial crisis. Racism is also a pathological pursuit of power that is offensive, purposeful and direct. Public Enemy was on to something when the group recorded the classic album Fear of a Black Planet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom this mindset, resources are to be taken, not shared. In this vein, racism protects against the dismantling of false narratives of white superiority that justify the hoarding of resources and the control of other people.\n\nUnderstanding patriarchy as a colonial expression used to control others can also help explain how teachers have come to oppress people of color. These are the so-called educators who are complicit in whitewashing blood-stained U.S. history. Instead of teaching about the genocide of indigenous tribes, they teach about taming \u201csavage Native Americans.\u201d Instead of teaching about armed resistance during the civil rights movement and revolutionary black leaders, they teach from texts that equate dignity with docility.\n\nEducational systems have historically helped a small number of powerful men control resources and people. This is how they do it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll teachers must understand how white privilege, i.e., the benefits that come from identifying as white, can lead to callousness and cultural insensitivity that is harmful to all students\u2019 well-being\u2014white ones who internalize that it\u2019s acceptable to behave in such a way, and minority students who learn that authority figures can treat them cruelly and get away with it.\n\nHere\u2019s a thought: What if more white teachers intentionally engaged with black and brown people in social contexts with the purpose of becoming anti-racist educators?\n\nTake Derek Black, 27, a white nationalist who was groomed to follow in the footsteps of his father, a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, but renounced those beliefs in college. Starting with attending Shabbat dinners with a diverse set of guests, and gradually questioning his identification with the white nationalist movement, Black ended up renouncing white supremacy and became an anti-racist educator.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile most teachers probably won\u2019t see themselves in either Black or Cummings, most should recognize that they associate with white norms, which makes it possible to act in racist ways, according to writer and education consultant Jamie Utt.\n\nConsequently, teachers can uproot racism by counteracting the ways in which whiteness shows up in the classroom. They can do this by educating themselves about culturally responsive teaching, establishing deeper connections with their students, asking students and families what they want to learn, and not making white norms the standard.\n\nBlack history should not reify oppression or confirm what people of color already know: Enslavement was a brutal practice then and racism in the classroom is cruel now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou don\u2019t have to teach children what it feels like to be a slave. Teach students something that schools and universities have yet to dedicate significant time to: understanding the mind of the oppressor and strategies to counter those beliefs.\n\nThis story was produced by the Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education, in partnership with The Root.", "keywords": ["racism", "slavery", "education", "teachers", "school", "slave", "teacher", "feel", "children", "white", "does", "dear", "oppressor", "black", "students"], "polarity": 0.00640880348197421, "subjectivity": 0.4281317237414797},

Corporate filings say Gregory Conte owns 49 percent of Sutton Whitfield, while Manjit Singh owns 51 percent, which qualifies Sutton Whitfield as a Small Disadvantaged Business with the Small Business Administration, a designation for companies owned by minorities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s not Conte\u2019s only business partnership: In September, corporate filings in Wyoming show, he formed a company called Tyr 1 Security, in partnership with a man named Brian Brathovd. Brian Brathovd has security experience: He is the bodyguard for Richard Spencer, the media-friendly white nationalist leader.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd Greg Conte\u2014under the name Greg Ritter\u2014has since August been the full-time director of operations for the National Policy Institute, Spencer\u2019s white-supremacist think tank. In Charlottesville and Washington D.C., Conte, the equal-employment officer, stood at Spencer\u2019s right hand. \u201cI don\u2019t know what would have happened to me in Charlottesville, or the alt right as a whole, without Greg,\u201d Spencer said in a recent podcast. \u201cGreg protected me as we fled the melee.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could say it\u2019s somewhat ironic,\u201d Conte told Splinter in a phone conversation.\n\nThe unmasking of racists has become a familiar script, one that is often authored initially by local anti-fascist and anti-racist activists who infiltrate reactionary networks and identify individuals within them. As white nationalists have become more assertive and more visible, they have been more likely to be recognized in their everyday lives\u2014as a college student, a hot dog restaurant worker, a former Marine recruiter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Conte\u2019s case, a self-identified \u201cfascist,\u201d who discussed racial superiority on a podcast he hosted, was listed as being in charge of nondiscrimination policy for a company that described its work as \u201crecruiting, vetting and placing IT specialists with the federal government, primary contractors, and subcontractors,\u201d according to its website. The archived show notes for one now-deleted podcast indicate that Conte and his co-host discussed the \u201cillegality of discrimination based on immigration status.\u201d The notes include a link to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\u2019s guidance on the matter.\n\nAt first, Conte\u2019s exposure seemed to follow the usual pattern: The connection between Sutton Whitfield and Spencer\u2019s National Policy Institute was a single phone number in a confidential document obtained and published by Atlanta Antifascists. The document was a guide to planning and security for Spencer\u2019s visit to the University of Florida on October 19th, referred to internally as Operation Gator. \u201cWe are taking security extremely seriously, and are keeping planning within our trusted group,\u201d the leaked guide says. \u201cCell phones must have an unlock code. This code must be at least 4 numbers (AND NOT \u20181488').\u201d This is a joke about white supremacist numerology: 14, for the \u201c14 Words\u201d slogan (\u201cWe must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children.\u201d); and 88 for \u201cHeil Hitler\u201d (H is the eighth letter of the alphabet).\n\nThe event required coordination between NPI staff and all the various other white nationalists going to Florida\u2014including Identity Evropa, Patriot Front (a rebranded splinter of Vanguard America, the group that the accused Charlottesville killer James Alex Fields marched with), and members of the League of the South, Anti-Communist Action, and so-called Daily Stormer book clubs. For central information, document referred participants to a phone number for Ritter. A search by Atlanta Antifascists found the same number on the Sutton Whitfield website, listed as the phone number for Conte, the equal employment opportunity officer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the same podcast in which Spencer expressed his gratitude to Conte for protecting him against militant anti-fascists, Conte bragged, \u201cI was basically trying to get doxxed.\u201d He went on to provide some further background information about himself, noting that he studied Russian at Georgetown University, where he was kicked out of the ROTC program. He recalled getting fired from a position working at an all-girls Catholic school. He did not, however, mention Sutton Whitfield.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConte confirmed to Splinter that he had worked at Sutton Whitfield, and said that he had left the company a few months ago, by mutual agreement. His political activities, he said, had nothing to do with his leaving, nor had his beliefs interfered with his ability to guide the firm\u2019s affirmative action employment policies. He compared himself to a communist bookseller who sells books under capitalism.\n\n\n\n\u201cI work within the existing political system,\u201d he said. \u201cI treat people as they are.\u201d\n\nManjit Singh, reached by email, offered a slightly different account of Conte\u2019s departure from Sutton Whitfield: \u201cA Mr. Conte was at one point employed at this company, but was terminated due to performance issues,\u201d Singh wrote. \u201cOther than that, it is company policy not to comment on current and former employee matters, due to legal concerns. We appreciate your concern for our company\u2019s reputation in bringing these activities to our attention, but again we stress our company\u2019s policy of not commenting because of legal reasons.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSingh\u2019s comment took the form of a corporate statement; the details, however, were off: saying an employee was fired for \u201cperformance issues\u201d seems contrary to Singh\u2019s twice-stated policy of not commenting on employment matters, for legal reasons. \u201cA Mr. Conte\u201d was an oddly distant way for a company\u2019s president to refer to his listed business partner. And no new paperwork has been filed to show that Conte\u2019s partnership status has changed since his purported separation from the company.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut oddities surround Sutton Whitfield. Its website claims the ability to meet a wide variety of technology staffing needs\u2014including \u201cContent Management Systems,\u201d \u201cApplication Development,\u201d \u201cCyber-Security,\u201d and \u201cAccounting Services\u201d\u2014through a recruitment process that uses \u201cthe latest in big data, predictive analysis, and machine learning techniques\u201d to identify job candidates.\n\n\u201cWe also offer employment background checks, drug tests, and background screenings,\u201d the site says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe site features a section on government contracting, with official classification codes for its different services. Yet there\u2019s no mention of which agencies, if any, would have contracted with it\u2014nor are there any testimonials or lists of other customers. The company also does not appear in public records for businesses receiving federal funds.\n\nWhen I began reporting this story, the company, based outside Washington, D.C., listed ten employees on LinkedIn, including some as far flung as Ithaca, New York; Miami, Florida; and Austria. (Now it lists nine.)\n\nOne of those listed employees, a first-year college student, told Splinter that they no longer were with the company, and had worked strictly from home as an unpaid intern, while still in high school. The ex-employee would not discuss the details of the job, saying they had signed a non-disclosure agreement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA call to another listed employee\u2019s phone number was answered by a man who identified himself as that person\u2019s father, and who said he did not know anything about Sutton Whitfield, Manjit Singh, or Gregory Conte.\n\nContact the Special Projects Desk This post was produced by the Special Projects Desk of Gizmodo Media.

If he had not left, Conte told Splinter, he would have been fired. \u201cIt was sort of a \u2018take the hemlock\u2019 situation,\u201d he said.\n\nSutton Whitfield was incorporated in 2015, filings show, but it was only in December of 2016 that Conte was officially made a partner. His history of pseudonymous online racism predated his becoming a diversity officer, however: Conte, as Ritter, started the small but influential white supremacist blog Atavistic Intelligentsia with his friend Vincent Law, producing podcasts and racist screeds; now, Conte and Law help run AltRight.com, a project of Richard Spencer\u2019s National Policy Institute.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOnly fascists can feel real sympathy,\u201d Conte wrote in July 2016, echoing decades of self-aggrandizing right-wing mysticism. \u201cSympathy, real sympathy, derives from a sense of tragedy\u2013the fatalistic understanding that bad things will happen. The fascist understands that other people are different from him and that they have their own aims, which sometimes conflict with his. Thus, he does not deem his enemies morally defective for opposing him. What are enemies for? My enemy and I strive to do each other harm. That is sad. If I were my enemy, I would do the same to me. That we find ourselves locked in a life-struggle against the Muslims is, and I really feel this, tragic. But it would be insane to pretend the struggle is not there.\u201d\n\nIn another blog post, titled \u201cShittiest Race War Ever,\u201d Conte lamented that a trip to Munich did not end in ethnic cleansing. \u201cI came to Europe fantasizing that this summer, it would be all in the open. I could hook up with some Serbian death squads and go full-Srebrenica on some kebabs. But instead we have this. There\u2019s simmering racial tension, frequent attacks in random locations, and consummately triggering race-cucking\u2013about which we can do nothing but meme and dream.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsked about his writing, Conte downplayed the seriousness of it. \u201cYou can\u2019t take these things at face value,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re written with a heavy dose of irony.\u201d He went on to complain about how the fascistic and ethno-nationalist trends gaining influence in American politics are misunderstood. He described himself as coming from a \u201ccounterintuitive background,\u201d saying he was a scholar of languages including Russian and Arabic and citing political theorists like Oswald Spenger and Peter Turchin as influences.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShortly after we spoke, all of the content published on Atavistic Intelligentsia was deleted. The website was subsequently taken offline altogether.\n\nAmong the now-missing content are podcasts Conte hosted with another racist who went by the name George Singh, and who said he was a Sikh man who had been influenced by the Austrian School libertarian Ludwig von Mises. Short descriptions of the podcasts remain on archived versions of the Atavistic Intelligentsia blog:\n\n\n\nRitter and Singh tackle the most difficult question in Western thought: Metaphysical Jewdaism. Why are some people, who appear to be Aryan, so goddamn Jewish in spirit? SJWs and academics, SWPLs and hipsters, is there something in the water?\n\nThe AI bros intended to cover India, but got side-tracked by the Jews. Ritter, Singh and Storminnorman break down the ethnogenesis of this unique people. How did their evolutionary strategy develop? How did they spread throughout Europe? What is the secret of their\u2026 uh\u2026 (((success)))?\n\nEven model minorities bring social costs: ethnic nepotism, test scams, and market manipulation. East Asians and Indians can be more dangerous than they look. Ritter and Singh compare high- and low-achieving minorities, and learn that the Yellow Peril is real. Hunker down for the Asian immivasion!\n\nAnd then there was the episode in which they discussed the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an interview with yet another alt-right podcast, Red Ice, which Singh recorded after he had attended last year\u2019s National Policy Institute conference in Washington, D.C., he described his cultural tradition and his politics as both being reactions against Islam.\u201dThe alt right is a lot like Sikhism in so far as it\u2019s a response to the spread of a foreign tradition,\u201d Singh said. \u201cThe Sikh faith in some sense is not really even a religion\u2014at least by Western standards. It\u2019s a military cult that eventually started LARPing as a religion.\u201d He shared that he became an \u201calt-righter\u201d after being exposed to the \u201cJ.Q.,\u201d short for the \u201cJewish Question.\u201d\n\nFor her part, podcast host Lana Lokteff recalled her surprise at meeting Singh at the conference:\n\nLokteff: You were one of the first people that greeted me...you were smiling and kind and wearing a turban! I was like, hmm, this is interesting. Singh: Ha ha, yeah, probably threw you off there. Lokteff: But of course you turned out to be a very cool guy.\n\nIn the same interview, Singh praised the current prime minister of India, Narendra Modi, for having \u201clooked the other way during a genocide of Muslims\u201d as Chief Minister of Gujarat, referring to a wave of ethnic cleansing in which thousands of people were killed and 150,000 were displaced. \u201cI hope he continues to look the other way as the natives respond as they should,\u201d Singh said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe also mocked the idea that race and gender have social elements, disclosing that he\u2019d been researching different state laws governing changing one\u2019s sex on paper and recommending that his white friends identify as Hispanic in an effort to circumvent affirmative action statutes. \u201cI sometimes put down that I\u2019m African-American,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cAll Man originated from Africa, so we n*ggas now.\u201d\n\nRed Ice deleted the episode from its Youtube channel and its website after being contacted by Splinter; an archived version remains here. Conte declined to provide contact information for George Singh, explaining that \u201che really values his privacy.\u201d\n\nShortly after the National Policy Institute conference, VICE published a portrait and short interview with Singh, identifying him as a \u201cone of Richard Spencer\u2019s key volunteers.\u201d Atavistic Intelligentsia sneered at VICE for boosting their co-host\u2019s profile: \u201cAI has always been a strong supporter of Affirmative Action, and we were pleased to see our active efforts to create a multicultural team finally paid off.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe man in the Vice photograph, his face turned away from the camera, wore a dark turban, rectangular glasses, a dark dress jacket, a gray sweater or vest, a light blue shirt, and a red bow tie with wide white stripes between narrow darker ones. Manjit Singh, in his LinkedIn profile photo, wore what appeared to be the same outfit, down to the striped bow tie. Shortly after he issued his statement to Splinter about Conte, Singh changed his profile picture and stopped responding to follow-up questions.\n\nAfter repeatedly declining to comment on the question, Conte eventually said that the George Singh who had co-hosted the Atavistic Intelligentsia podcast, had attended the NPI conference, and had given the Red Ice interview was not the Manjit Singh who he worked with at Sutton Whitfield. \u201cWhy would I have my boss on my podcast?\u201d he asked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPresented with the similarities between the two, Conte said, \u201cWell, that\u2019s all just circumstantial.\u201d\n\nIn any case, two other people who had attended the conference said they recognized the person shown in Manjit Singh\u2019s LinkedIn photo as having been there. \u201cHe was definitely at the front table, checking people in on Saturday,\u201d one recalled.\n\nLast month, hoping to find Manjit Singh and to learn more about Sutton Whitfield\u2019s business activities, I drove to the company\u2019s office address in Frederick, Maryland, about an hour outside Washington, D.C. Rather than being in an office complex, it was in a residential development full of nondescript townhouses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe headquarters building was one of those townhouses, the second in from the end of its block, with sagging plain beige siding. A crooked white plastic picket fence stood outside, and garbage and dead leaves gathered in a corner of the front yard. The paint on the screen door was peeling. The windows were dark. At two o\u2019clock in the afternoon on a weekday, nobody answered the door; at six o\u2019clock, there was still no response.\n\nIn the backseat of a car parked directly outside, paperwork with the name \u201cManjit Singh\u201d sat next to a copy of Ludwig von Mises\u2019 Human Action. A passing neighbor told me that he hadn\u2019t seen anyone come in or out of the building in weeks.\n\nAdvertisement", "keywords": ["supremacist", "employment", "whitfield", "company", "job", "sutton", "equal", "white", "podcast", "manjit", "singh", "officer", "conte", "policy"], "polarity": 0.03058688833336719, "subjectivity": 0.3507170971959705},

Trump) and one of the original members of #BeardGang.\n\nWhat did he do?\n\nIn the late \u201960s, Manson inspired a brutal series of nine murders, including that of Sharon Tate, an actress who was eight-and-a-half months pregnant.\n\nWhy, though?\n\nRacism and sex. And drugs. And a failed record deal. But mostly racism.\n\nManson wanted to start a race war that would finally make white people see how dangerous black people were. The handsome, charismatic man gained a cult following among a gullible group of followers he convinced that blacks were going to start a violent uprising. He convinced his believers that the protests following the death of Martin Luther King Jr. were the beginning of a black movement and that the only way whites could remain in power was by taking control through a race war.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeems legit. So what did they do?\n\nManson combined a message only he understood from the Beatles\u2019 song \u201cHelter Skelter\u201d and the Bible to plan his race war. The first part of the plan was simple. First, he and his followers were going to have group sex. Then they were going to do drugs and record an album. Then they would do more drugs and have more sex, and then they were going to commit a series of murders. Then people would listen to the album and understand how gangsta he was. It was the original \u201cstreet cred\u201d plan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter shooting a man named Bernard Crowe, whom Manson believed to be a member of the Black Panthers, Manson and his followers held Gary Hinman hostage for two days before killing him and writing \u201cPolitical Piggy\u201d on the wall in Hinman\u2019s blood. They then drew a panther paw on the wall in blood to falsely symbolize that the Black Panthers were responsible.\n\nThe next part of the plan was to target Terry Melcher, a music executive who wouldn\u2019t sign Manson to a record deal. Unbeknownst to Manson\u2019s followers, the music executive had moved out of his house, and it was now owned by Roman Polanski, a director who would later become famous for his movies ... and child molestation. Since Manson and his members were already at the house, and not wanting to waste gas money, the Manson Family cult members decided to murder Polanski\u2019s pregnant wife, actress Sharon Tate, along with four others who were in the home.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter a night of sex, drugs and rock and roll, the Manson Family found Leno and Rosemary LaBianca and killed them, too. Then the Manson followers wrote \u201cDeath to pigs\u201d and \u201cRise\u201d in their victims\u2019 blood, again to falsely point the finger at militant blacks.\n\nMembers of the cult later murdered a number of other people and even attempted to assassinate President Gerald Ford.\n\nDuring the murder trials, Manson shaved his head because, he said, \u201cI am the devil, and the devil has always had a bald head.\u201d He then later carved an \u201cx\u201d in his forehead, prompting the members of his cult to show up at court the next day with their own forehead X\u2019s. Manson, never to be outdone, later changed the \u201cx\u201d to a swastika.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nManson was sentenced to die, but after the death penalty was eliminated in California, he and the members of the Manson Family had their sentences commuted to life in prison.\n\nHow was his music?\n\nI won\u2019t lie. It was kinda fire. If SZA or Solange made a funky remake of \u201cLook at Your Game Girl,\u201d I might download it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t you think that\u2019s a little inappropriate?\n\nI\u2019m not promoting his music. I\u2019m just saying ... plus, he\u2019s dead, bruh.\n\nWell, damn, I\u2019m glad that won\u2019t happen again.\n\nYeah. There\u2019s no way a charismatic young man could inspire that kind of hate. After all, it\u2019s 2017. White people aren\u2019t stupid enough to believe that the fact that black people are simply fighting for their rights actually makes them a dangerous group of revolutionaries bent on committing violence against whites.

If Oswalt posts bail, he will be banned from the university\u2019s campus and from having any contact with members of the Corvallis chapter of Showing Up for Racial Justice. He will also have to surrender four firearms that authorities say they discovered in his home.\n\nAccording to the news site, Oswalt drew attention to himself last week after he wrote about some of his trash views in a student newspaper article, sparking outrage on the campus.\n\nIt turns out that last week was also the first time he was arrested on suspicion of criminal mischief for what authorities say was his little bumper sticker stunt last summer off campus. However, he was released the same day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolice say that Oswalt and another unidentified individual put the racist bumper stickers\u2014which contained a hateful slur against black people\u2014on two cars that belonged to social activists parked outside a local food co-op.\n\nThe stickers that were placed on the cars covered messages that supported immigrants and refugees.\n\nAt the same time, an employee discovered that someone had also put anti-Semitic leaflets on the windshields of every car in the staff parking lot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis is a hate crime inspired by ignorance, fueled by racism and aimed at people of color,\u201d Benton County Deputy District Attorney Ryan Joslin told The Oregonian. \u201cIt was his intent to terrorize both individuals and a group of people.\u201d\n\nMere days after his first arrest last week, photos of Oswalt throwing up Nazi salutes from a highway overpass, carrying a swastika flag on Holocaust Remembrance Day and marching with white nationalists at a Portland, Ore., rally last April surfaced on the website of the Pacific Northwest Anti-Fascist Workers Collective, a group made up of anti-fascist activists from Oregon and Washington state.\n\nThis is not the first time that Oswalt\u2019s white supremacist beliefs have been documented, The Oregonian notes. Last July, he and three other known white nationalists were stopped by officers on the Eugene campus of the university. The four men had staples, flyers and a ladder with white supremacist propaganda written on it saying things like, \u201cDiversity means fewer white people.\u201d", "keywords": ["say", "stickers", "criminal", "student", "hate", "oregonian", "rep", "white", "crime", "racist", "placement", "week", "state", "facing", "oregon", "oswalt"], "polarity": -0.1054398148148148, "subjectivity": 0.26990740740740743},

She posted comments about how she wanted to harm people who attended \u201cfree speech\u201d rallies. She talked about radical ideology and even shared pictures, names and addresses of U.S. soldiers. The affidavit against her includes the following:\n\n(a) a link containing photographs, addresses, other contact information, and even credit card information of United States Army, Navy and State Department employees (1 29); (b) a Tweet that a media personality \u201cwould be better off without her head\u201d (l) 33); and, (c) a link in a retweet that lists the town of residence and phone number for approximately 150 United States Air Force personnel with the following quote: \u2018Rejoice, O supporters of the Caliphate State, with the dissemination of the information to be delivered to lone wolves,\u2019 God said: \u2018And slay them wherever you may come upon them.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYassin has never killed anyone. She hasn\u2019t committed an act of terror; nor has she ever given money to a terrorist organization. But make no mistake about it\u2014in the eyes of the law, Yassin is a terrorist.\n\nAndrew Anglin is the founder and owner of the Daily Stormer\u2014the most popular white supremacist website in the country. Earlier this year he incited his readers into harassing American University Student Government President Taylor Dumpson until she required police protection.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to a civil lawsuit against Anglin, he also initiated a \u201ctroll storm\u201d of death threats, promises of physical violence and harassment against Tanya Gersh, a Jewish real estate attorney in Whitefish, Mont. The lawsuit states (pdf):\n\n\n\n14. Mr. Anglin and his followers targeted Ms. Gersh\u2019s husband, as well. Mr. Gersh received many threatening, hateful, and harassing phone calls, voicemails, false online reviews of his law firm and emails including this one: \u201cPut your uppity slut wife Tanya back in her cage, you rat-faced kike. Tell your scamming son [name omitted] to kill himself, too. Day of the rope soon for your entire family.\u201d 88. Mr. Anglin also published the Twitter handle of Ms. Gersh\u2019s twelve- year-old son and encouraged readers to take to Twitter and \u201ctell them what you think of his whore mother\u2019s vicious attack on the community of Whitefish.\u201d Mr. Anglin called Ms. Gersh\u2019s son a \u201ccreepy little faggot\u201d and a \u201cscamming little kike.\u201d Mr. Anglin further accused Ms. Gersh\u2019s son of \u201cpushing advertising scams\u201d on his Twitter followers. 89. Mr. Anglin also published Mr. Gersh\u2019s work phone number and work email, and included a link for readers to submit a Google review of Mr. Gersh\u2019s law firm. Mr. Anglin further encouraged readers to \u201cgive him a call or stop by his office and let him know what you think of his wife\u2019s behavior, advise him to get a leash on that hoe.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese two cases highlight the disparity in the urgency with which law enforcement agencies treat white supremacists and their organizations. Both people in the above examples essentially threatened and harassed American citizens. Both used the internet, social media and the public domain to intimidate and cause terror.\n\n\n\nYet Anglin is not wanted by law enforcement agencies for terrorism, harassment or any crime. More important, numerous neo-Nazi, white nationalist and white supremacist organizations operate in broad daylight. They perpetuate violence and extremism without impunity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy are they immune?\n\nBefore her arrest, Yassin had been watched by numerous federal agencies responsible for eliminating terrorism, including the FBI. Her allegiance to foreign terrorism was deemed a credible threat because the Islamic State is believed to have inspired the murders of at least 68 Americans.\n\nTo be clear, none of the nearly 70 deaths have been attributed directly to ISIS. Authorities have only linked the group to social media accounts and websites that have \u201cradicalized\u201d perpetrators or \u201cinspired\u201d the incidents of terror. That is enough to land their sympathizers on the list of people who law enforcement agencies train their sights on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn May 2017, the Department of Homeland Security issued a report entitled \u201cWhite Extremism Poses Persistent Threat of Lethal Violence\u201d (pdf). The agency cited the statistic that white supremacists \u201cwere responsible for 49 homicides in 26 attacks from 2000 to 2016 \u2026 more than any other domestic extremist movement.\u201d\n\nWhen these homegrown terrorists staged a May rally in Berkeley, Calif., that grew violent, no one was charged with domestic terror. When police confiscated hundreds of weapons at a Portland, Ore., white supremacist rally in June, it still did not rise to the level of terror.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough white supremacists laid siege to the entire town of Charlottesville, Va., and a woman was killed\u2014despite the warnings of the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security\u2014none of the participants have yet to be called \u201cdomestic terrorists.\u201d\n\nWhy is that? If these people are not terrorists, worthy of being placed on the government\u2019s terror watch list, then who is?\n\nThe FBI\u2019s Terrorist Screening Center maintains a list of suspected terrorists. Being added to the Terrorist Screening Database is not an arbitrary process. The Intercept uncovered the document (pdf), \u201cWatchlisting Guidance: National Counterterrorism Center 2013 Publication,\u201d that spells out how one lands on this list. It states that:\n\n\n\nFor watchlisting purposes under this Guidance, \u201cTERRORIST and/or TERRORIST ACTIVITIES\u201d combine elements from various federal definitions and are considered to: 1.14.1 involve violent acts or acts that are dangerous to human life, property, or infrastructure which are violations of U.S. law, or may have been, if those acts occurred in the United States, and 1.14.2 appear to be intended\u2014 to intimidate or coerce a civilian population;\n\nto influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or\n\nto affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, kidnapping, or hostage-taking.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is no doubt that these organizations espouse violence against human life. Just before he killed Heather Heyer, James Fields marched with the neo-Nazi group Vanguard America in Charlottesville. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, Dylann Roof was a regular visitor and commenter on the Daily Stormer before he committed the mass murder at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C. The people who beat Deandre Harris with poles and sticks in Charlottesville wore white nationalist gear.\n\nThey undoubtedly converged on Charlottesville to \u201cintimidate a civilian population.\u201d White nationalist Richard Spencer called it a \u201chuge moral victory in terms of the show of force.\u201d They also satisfied the watch list requirement that defines a terrorist activity as intending to \u201cinfluence the policy of a government by intimidation ... or affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction.\u201d They said beforehand that they wanted to stop the city government\u2019s already cemented decision to remove the statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.\n\nAccording to the TSC document, anyone is worthy of being added to the list according to the government\u2019s definition of reasonable suspicion. The report defines \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d as applying to anyone who has \u201crepeated contact with individuals identified by the IC [independent counsel] as teaching or espousing an ideology that includes the justification of the unlawful use of violence or violent extremism.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Watchlisting Guidance reads like a thorough explanation of the white supremacist movement. Every federal agency is aware of the existential threat it poses to America. Law enforcement officers know exactly where members can be found, and know their racist, extremist ideology.\n\nYet somehow they are not considered terrorists.\n\nThis is why Heather Heyer is dead. This is why Deandre Harris\u2019 scalp is held together with stitches. This is why the bodies of Cynthia Hurd, Susie Jackson, Ethel Lee Lance, DePayne Middleton, Clementa C. Pinckney, Tywanza Sanders, Daniel Simmons, Sharonda Coleman-Singleton and Myra Thompson rest in Charleston cemeteries.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause of federal law enforcement\u2019s apathy toward the lives of American citizens. Because no one is willing to call the purveyors of hate a threat to our nation. Because of the unwillingness of people like Donald Trump to condemn the fires of extremism they helped kindle. Because the purveyors of hate know that they can terrorize, threaten and kill without worrying that they will be painted with the broad brush of \u201cterrorist.\u201d\n\nBut mostly because they are white.", "keywords": ["supremacists", "anglin", "gershs", "violence", "mr", "terror", "states", "federal", "white", "law", "watch", "terrorist", "arent", "list"], "polarity": -0.004407051282051284, "subjectivity": 0.3648536559594252},

Faced with a maelstrom of criticism over the school\u2019s perceived apathy and lack of concern for the constituents of the heralded Virginia school, the Pirates of Hampton now face a quiet mutiny that has not only manifested itself on campus but has also spilled over onto social media and the public eye.\n\nHampton trails only Spelman College and Howard University on U.S. News & World Report\u2019s 2018 list of the best HBCUs in America. Founded in 1868, the liberal arts institution of more than 4,600 students is always included in the list of historically black schools known as the \u201cblack Ivy League.\u201d\n\nOn Feb. 20, Hampton students, frustrated by a number of unaddressed issues, held a town hall meeting to confront the school administration\u2019s seeming indifference to the concerns repeatedly raised by various groups at the school. According to several Hampton students who spoke with The Root, the airing of grievances quickly turned contentious when students felt that Hampton\u2019s leadership was ignoring and belittling their concerns.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the more important issues mentioned at the protests and by the students who reached out to The Root was what the students described as a prevailing culture of sexual assault on campus and the administration\u2019s perceived unwillingness to address the issue.\n\n\n\nEach freshman and transfer to Hampton is required to take a course called University 101, focused on the tradition of the college. According to the university, the U101 course covers test anxiety, personal finance, the dress code and even the alma mater. The student catalog describes the University 101 course as:\n\nA one-semester required orientation course designed to improve the quality of the freshman experience for entering students by helping them understand the purpose and value of higher education at Hampton University, as well as the larger context in which that education takes place and the multicultural nature of the problems and concerns which it addresses; to develop positive attitudes toward the teaching learning process; and to acquire coping skills essential for successful college life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite the school\u2019s past problems with sexual assault, including a 2014 case of a faculty member allegedly assaulting a student and a report that the school is being investigated by the Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Division for violating Title IX campus sexual-violence policies, Hampton still lags behind other schools in informing students about sexual assault on campus.\n\nFor comparison, since 2014, Howard University has mandated that all freshmen take Title IX training. According to student organizers, Hampton, in its University 101 course, has chosen to solve its campus problem of sexual misconduct in a unique way:\n\nBy not addressing it at all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven more troubling, Hampton\u2019s coordinator for Title IX\u2014the law that protects against sexual discrimination in any institution that receives federal funding\u2014is Kelly Harvey-Viney, the daughter of Hampton\u2019s president of 40 years, William Harvey.\n\n\n\nStudents have complained that her position may conflict with the interests of victims of assault at the school, noting that some students may be reluctant to step forward to complain about rape and sexual assault if the Title IX program is headed by someone more interested in protecting the reputation of the university and its president. In a letter to the administration, the HU Student Collective proposed that the Title IX process for reporting sexual misconduct and understanding consent be embedded in the University 101 course.\n\nKimberly Burton, a graduating senior at Hampton and one of the many students who contacted The Root, noted: \u201cThe campus put up lights and emergency stations around campus to make sure students are safe.\u201d She added, \u201cMany of them\u2014I\u2019m standing in front of one of the emergency stations right now\u2014just don\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the Feb. 20 town hall, after a female student described her campus sexual assault and the university\u2019s lack of response, instead of displaying empathy for the alleged victim or issuing an apology, President Harvey chose to interrupt and attack the student in an exchange shared on social media, despite Harvey\u2019s insistence that students not record the proceedings:\n\nIn a statement about the summit, the university noted that it \u201cappreciates the bravery of students who come forward to address the important issue of sexual assault.\u201d It added:\n\nThe University empathizes with these students and considers this a very important matter. The Title IX Coordinator was present at the meeting and provided the group with an overview of the process. She agreed to provide students with additional educational sessions so they understand the process and feel comfortable with reporting incidents.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the town hall, the student collective asked that Harvey-Viney resign her position as Hampton\u2019s Title IX program coordinator or be reassigned to another department, citing her relationship with the president and what they see as a conflict of interest.\n\nAfter witnessing this display of appreciation and empathy, why would any victim of sexual misconduct feel uneasy about taking any complaints to the daughter of this man?\n\nAside from the unsafe, nonworking lights and call stations, the conditions of facilities on campus have deteriorated into what some campus dwellers feel are hazardous. Students report rampant mold in dorms and unsanitary conditions in the student cafeteria.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStudents report that maintenance requests often go unanswered, and the prevailing narrative is that the campus food-service department doesn\u2019t care about cleanliness or the quality of the food.\n\n\u201cI am not a picky eater, but my friends and I bring our own silverware to the cafeteria,\u201d said Burton, who has lived on campus for four years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA follow-up report by the Student Government Association relayed: \u201cAs it relates to the current state of the dining hall, a picture was circulated by a female student which showed bugs on an apple pie tartlet. The bugs were not found until after the student left the dining hall. Therefore, it is not known when the bugs got on the dessert.\u201d\n\nIn response, Doretha Spells, Hampton University\u2019s vice president for business affairs and treasurer, noted that neither the dining hall nor Gourmet Services has failed an inspection, and pointed to a planned renovation of facilities, including the dining area.\n\nAfter the heated Feb. 20 meeting, the administration at Hampton issued a list of proposals that it hoped would address the reported issues. But students felt that the administration\u2019s response was eerily familiar to the previous ways it ignored the concerns. The students decided to counter the proposals with their own manifesto outlining their grievances.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey followed this with a silent march through campus that ended on Harvey\u2019s front lawn and was attended by hundreds of enrollees at the school. In addition, students are using social media to protest and highlight the inaction and indifference at their university.\n\nAlthough the issues might seem trivial to some, the motivation to protest and change the community of which they are a part is not only laudable but also an important part of the educational process for those who will likely become the next generation of leaders.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to invite President Harvey to eat in the cafeteria for one week,\u201d Burton said. \u201cI would love to see him live in the dorms for seven days straight. The school\u2019s response isn\u2019t a way to fix these problems. It\u2019s a way to shut us up.

Starr has been Columbused by many in the mainstream media in the last several weeks. As the Russian hack on the 2016 election and President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s relationship with Russian leader Vladimir Putin dominate the headlines, outlets are looking for a fresh take on Russian politics and American vulnerabilities.\n\nTerrell J. Starr\u2014tall, black, lanky, with a Detroit accent, and who is just as likely to lay out facts in Russian as he is to compare Putin to Marlo Stansfield from The Wire\u2014has stepped into the gap.\n\nHe may not \"look\" like your typical Russian/Eastern European political expert, but with a Fulbright scholarship and degrees in journalism and ethnic conflict, Terrell J. Starr just might be black Generation X\u2019s best chance to understand what is happening in this postelection Trump/Putin world.\n\nStarr spoke with The Root about his experiences in Russia, what really happened with the hack and the racial dangers associated with Trump\u2019s cozy relationship with Putin.\n\n\u201cI grew up in inner-city Detroit; both my uncles sold drugs,\u201d Starr says.\n\nNot exactly the background many people think would lead to becoming one of the media\u2019s newest experts on Russia. With help from family and some teachers, Starr went to Philander Smith College, a small, private, historically black college in Little Rock, Ark.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAround my freshman year in 2001, there was an international volunteer program that I signed up for,\u201d says Starr.\n\nHe hoped to work in Africa, any country in Africa. Instead, he was assigned to Russia: \u201cI was like \u2026 Russia? Who wants to go there?\u201d\n\nBut that trip changed his life and set him up for the career he has today.\n\n\u201cOne of the first things I noticed when I was in Moscow was like, 'How did all of these Africans get here?' I thought I was going to be the only one,\u201d he says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter a few months on his first trip, Starr was intellectually sold on Russia.\n\n\u201cI fell in love with the language. I didn\u2019t understand a word of it, but I loved how it sounds,\u201d he says.\n\nHe traveled through Estonia and Georgia and was in Ukraine for the Orange Revolution in 2005. The more he traveled and learned, the more enamored he became with the politics of the region, and how the racial dynamics of America fit so well into the politics on the ground in the former Soviet republics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cGeorgians considered themselves black. Poles are like the white trash of Europe. I had no idea I would learn so much about race. Especially from people who, by American standards, would be considered white,\u201d he says.\n\nThrough his travels and research, Starr has seen how Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia initiates cyberattacks and foments dissent. While various former republics attempt to break the political and economic chains that Russia has on them, Putin usually starts with a disinformation campaign to discredit political leaders who would stand against him.\n\n\u201cPutin did this in Adjara, the Ukraine and South Ossetia,\u201d relates Starr as he runs down a list of nations Russia has attempted to disrupt politically through cyberwarfare in recent years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring the Ukrainian presidential election of 2014, four days before the vote, Russian hackers calling themselves CyberBerkut shut down the Ukrainian election commission for 20 hours. This attack destroyed hardware, software and the ability to track voter turnout.\n\nOn Election Day, minutes before the polls closed, CyberBerkut hacked into the election-commission website and posted false election results that were mysteriously reported by Russian television almost immediately. Given that history, it\u2019s not hard to understand what Russia was capable of\u2014with Donald Trump\u2019s help\u2014in America.\n\nCrowdstrike, the private security firm famous for uncovering and tracking down those responsible for the Sony email hack, has been onto the Russians for months and shared information with the CIA. As early as June, it filed reports that the Russians had hacked the Democratic National Committee and were sharing emails with WikiLeaks and the Trump campaign.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStarr notes that a likely Russian paid hacker known as Guccifer 2.0, along with others, is contacted through the dark web to do the dirty work Russia doesn\u2019t want to get directly implicated in.\n\n\u201cAll of these attacks have been targeted at some form of racial strife,\u201d he says.\n\nWhen the Ukraine elected a pro-Western leader, Russia spread disinformation aimed at stoking pride among ethnic Russians in the nation. Russians were encouraged to \"take their country back\" and take up arms against other ethnic groups and leaders they didn\u2019t respect. Not a far cry from President-elect Trump, who on more than one occasion alluded to shooting Hillary Clinton.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo what does this mean for America, and African Americans in particular, heading into a Trump presidency?\n\nAccording to Starr, \u201cRussia is one of the most anti-Semitic and anti-black countries in the world. There was a point in the early 2000s when dozens of African students were murdered. The government does nothing about it. Putin used the same \"crackdown on crime\" language as Trump.\u201d\n\nThe potential parallels between the rise of Putin, and the commensurate racial violence against people of color and the rise of hate crimes, and the election of Trump are eerie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an attempt to distract from a sagging economy and his own corruption, Putin has tacitly endorsed white nationalism/Russian pride and turned a blind eye to violence against African immigrants in particular. African students and businesspeople are regularly assaulted, killed and attacked on subways and in public spaces in Moscow.\n\nPutin and state-controlled media focus almost exclusively on mythical \u201cblack drug dealers\u201d to justify this fear and violence.

Among the findings: Nine of the 10 states with the biggest gaps were found in the South.\n\n\n\nThe Hechinger Report released an interactive look Monday at how many black and Latinx high school graduates make it to their state\u2019s main college or university. Why focus on the state\u2019s flagship public institution as opposed to, say, a better-known or more competitive private school? As the Baltimore Sun points out, schools like the University of Maryland, College Park, and the University of Mississippi, because they\u2019re taxpayer-funded, typically emphasize service to in-state students. They\u2019re considered \u201cbeacons of attainable, affordable education,\u201d the Sun writes, but on top of that, students who graduate from flagship universities tend to make more than their peers who went to other state-funded schools.\n\nA large gap between the percentage of black high school grads a state produces and the percentage enrolled at a flagship campus, then, can point to a troubling gap in who a state\u2019s high school graduates are, and who gets the best educational opportunities from college onward.\n\nThe University of Mississippi, the University of South Carolina, the University of Georgia, Louisiana State University and the University of Delaware have the worst gaps in the country, with Ole Miss leading the way. In 2015, half of Mississippi\u2019s graduates were black, yet Ole Miss\u2019 total black student enrollment that year was just 10 percent.\n\nThe study also looked at Latinx students. A regional pattern emerged in these findings, too\u2014though not as stark as the corresponding study covering black students. States in the Southwest and West made up a majority of the top 10, with California, Texas, Nevada, Colorado and Arizona having the largest gaps. In California, Latinx students received more than half of all high school diplomas in 2015, but Latinx students made up less than 15 percent of the student body at the state\u2019s flagship campus, the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Baltimore Sun, writing about the University of Maryland, which had the sixth-worst gap for black students, covers a few reasons why the lag exists there.\n\nThe article notes that UMD College Park is surrounded by HBCUs, including Howard University in Washington, D.C., which offer strong competition in recruiting black students. Racist incidents on the College Park campus may have also deterred black students looking for a more welcoming, inclusive and safe environment. Just last year, a black Bowie State University student was killed, allegedly by a white Maryland student in a crime prosecutors say was race-motivated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoing to a school where 10 percent or less of the student body looks like you can be an isolating experience. The recent uptick in hate incidents on majority-white college campuses means that isolation can also be dangerous.\n\nDisparities in the quality of high schools that serve majority-black communities were also pointed out as a possible contributing factor.

The school had recently garnered national attention because one of its students posted a viral Snapchat video that showed her gleefully referring to black people as \u201cniggers.\u201d In one video, the teen said, to the horror and delight of a nearby friend, \u201cWhen the police were killing all those black people, I was so happy because I was like, \u2018Fuck black people; go die, bitches.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRachael Francois, who attends Elk Grove, said that the incident was not shocking. For months, she and other students had reported anti-black harassment they experienced at the Sacramento, Calif.-area school to school administrators, to little avail.\n\nNow another Sacramento high school is coming under fire amid claims that it repeatedly ignored racial abuse on its campus. A pair of teens have filed a civil rights complaint against Mira Loma High School, claiming that educators ignored repeated complaints about racial harassment in an elite college-prep program. The repeated racial abuse, the teens claim, drove them from the rigorous academic course.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the Sacramento Bee reports, the complaint was filed on behalf of Makayla Madkins and De\u2019Ajhane Caldwell, two teens who attended the Sacramento school. The two, who are cousins, were both enrolled in the school\u2019s prestigious International Baccalaureate program, where the racism allegedly occurred.\n\nBut the individual harassment is only one part of the claim, which is now being investigated by the U.S. Department of Education. The complaint says that the problems were systemic: Not only did school officials do nothing when the racist abuse was brought to their attention, but the complaint alleges that Mira Loma routinely suspends black students at higher rates than the rest of its student population, and frequently denies them access to educational opportunities.\n\nThe complaint was filed in December. On Tuesday the San Juan Unified School District acknowledged that it \u201chad received a letter from the federal Office of Civil Rights requesting information,\u201d the Bee reports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDe\u2019Ahjane and Makayla attribute the harassment to one classmate, whom they identify in the complaint as a Persian boy, naming him by the initials \u201cV.B.\u201d De\u2019Ahjane claims that V.B., with whom she shared a Spanish class, called her a \u201cnigger\u201d in class as often as twice a week.\n\nFrom the Sacramento Bee:\n\nOften, when [De\u2019Ahjane] raised her hand in class to speak, the boy would say that black people are dumb, referring to her with the N-word, the complaint charges. He also used sexually derogatory language, said Makayla Madkins\u2019s sister Chardonnay Madkins, a 2010 graduate of the IB program.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDe\u2019Ahjane\u2019s teacher, the complaint alleges, did nothing.\n\nThe complaint says the Spanish teacher heard the boy\u2019s comments on several occasions, but intervened only once. The teacher sent him to the office after he referred to Caldwell as \u201ca N-word\u201d while he was arguing with another student. Caldwell said the teacher never spoke to her about the incident even after sending V.B. out of the room. The boy returned to class just five minutes after he left and continued harassing her through the school year, according to the complaint.\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile this in-class harassment was happening, De\u2019Ahjane\u2019s cousin Makayla was being harassed by V.B. online.\n\nMadkins, 17, objected to the use of derogatory language against mentally impaired people that V.B.\u2019s sister, also a Mira Loma student, had posted on Instagram, the complaint says. In response, Madkins said in an interview, V.B. called her the N-word in a social media post. V.B. also called a friend of Madkins\u2019 a \u201ccrippled ass N-word\u201d on her Instagram account and called other students who complained about his post \u201cN-words,\u201d the complaint alleges. The online harassment accelerated with the boy and his friends adding sexual slurs about the girls to their derogatory posts on Instagram and Twitter.\ufeff\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough the girls took screenshots of the comments and shared them with school administrators, school officials did nothing to stop the harassment, the girls say. In the complaint, Makayla\u2019s mother, Latrice Madkins, says that she made repeated attempts to speak with school administrators about the racist bullying but was repeatedly turned down.\n\nWhen they did finally meet, Mira Loma\u2019s vice principal promised that there would be an investigation and that administrators would speak to teachers who had failed to address the problems. Promises were also made to develop \u201cbetter policies and procedures\u201d to handle student complains, the Bee reports.\n\nBut the girls say that none of that actually happened. In fact, after the meeting, the vice principal sat in on a Spanish class to monitor De\u2019Ahjane, not her tormentor. V.B. was never removed from the class, as was requested, and at one point was moved to a seat directly behind De\u2019Ahjane.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\ufeffIt\u2019s necessary to view the case of this high school, nestled in what\u2019s assumed to be one of the most progressive areas in the nation, in this context: For many educational institutions, this is business as usual.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note the systemic quality of these allegations. The complaint details how black students at Mira Loma, for example, were suspended at three times California\u2019s statewide rate last year (the school suspended 28 percent of its black students). These students were three times more likely to be suspended than their Latinx peers, four times more likely than their white classmates and 16 times more likely than Asian students.\n\nAnd not only were black students punished at higher rates, but they were also shut out of key opportunities for educational advancement, like the IB program. As the Bee points out, black students make up 10 percent of the school\u2019s population but only 2 percent of the prestigious academic program.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Mira Loma\u2019s numbers may be particularly egregious, they are in no way unique. It\u2019s necessary to view the case of this high school, nestled in what\u2019s assumed to be one of the most progressive areas in the nation, in this context: For many educational institutions, this is business as usual.\n\nBut it\u2019s also important to remember how systemic problems\u2014the function of both institutional neglect and malfeasance\u2014have massive consequences for individual lives. It\u2019s difficult to be accepted into an IB program, and completing one has a major effect on a student\u2019s academic career: Apart from making students more attractive to colleges, if a student scores high enough on an end-of-course IB exam, colleges can offer that student credit for introductory courses. With a college-application process that is increasingly competitive, and with college itself increasingly expensive, these sorts of advantages are huge for students.\n\nDe\u2019Ahjane won\u2019t have that opportunity. Citing the abuse and the school\u2019s handling of it, she left Mira Loma at the end of the 2016-2017 school year. She\u2019s now taking online courses to complete her high school diploma.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt kind of put me off track,\u201d De\u2019Ahjane told the Bee. \u201cI am not really the kind of person for homeschool ... that kind of messed me up, but I am working through it.\u201d", "keywords": ["need", "complaint", "harassment", "student", "sacramento", "mira", "talk", "black", "racist", "handle", "vb", "school", "high", "schools", "students"], "polarity": 0.05088003933136676, "subjectivity": 0.47205506391347085},

Faced with a maelstrom of criticism over the school\u2019s perceived apathy and lack of concern for the constituents of the heralded Virginia school, the Pirates of Hampton now face a quiet mutiny that has not only manifested itself on campus but has also spilled over onto social media and the public eye.\n\nHampton trails only Spelman College and Howard University on U.S. News & World Report\u2019s 2018 list of the best HBCUs in America. Founded in 1868, the liberal arts institution of more than 4,600 students is always included in the list of historically black schools known as the \u201cblack Ivy League.\u201d\n\nOn Feb. 20, Hampton students, frustrated by a number of unaddressed issues, held a town hall meeting to confront the school administration\u2019s seeming indifference to the concerns repeatedly raised by various groups at the school. According to several Hampton students who spoke with The Root, the airing of grievances quickly turned contentious when students felt that Hampton\u2019s leadership was ignoring and belittling their concerns.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the more important issues mentioned at the protests and by the students who reached out to The Root was what the students described as a prevailing culture of sexual assault on campus and the administration\u2019s perceived unwillingness to address the issue.\n\n\n\nEach freshman and transfer to Hampton is required to take a course called University 101, focused on the tradition of the college. According to the university, the U101 course covers test anxiety, personal finance, the dress code and even the alma mater. The student catalog describes the University 101 course as:\n\nA one-semester required orientation course designed to improve the quality of the freshman experience for entering students by helping them understand the purpose and value of higher education at Hampton University, as well as the larger context in which that education takes place and the multicultural nature of the problems and concerns which it addresses; to develop positive attitudes toward the teaching learning process; and to acquire coping skills essential for successful college life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite the school\u2019s past problems with sexual assault, including a 2014 case of a faculty member allegedly assaulting a student and a report that the school is being investigated by the Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Division for violating Title IX campus sexual-violence policies, Hampton still lags behind other schools in informing students about sexual assault on campus.\n\nFor comparison, since 2014, Howard University has mandated that all freshmen take Title IX training. According to student organizers, Hampton, in its University 101 course, has chosen to solve its campus problem of sexual misconduct in a unique way:\n\nBy not addressing it at all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven more troubling, Hampton\u2019s coordinator for Title IX\u2014the law that protects against sexual discrimination in any institution that receives federal funding\u2014is Kelly Harvey-Viney, the daughter of Hampton\u2019s president of 40 years, William Harvey.\n\n\n\nStudents have complained that her position may conflict with the interests of victims of assault at the school, noting that some students may be reluctant to step forward to complain about rape and sexual assault if the Title IX program is headed by someone more interested in protecting the reputation of the university and its president. In a letter to the administration, the HU Student Collective proposed that the Title IX process for reporting sexual misconduct and understanding consent be embedded in the University 101 course.\n\nKimberly Burton, a graduating senior at Hampton and one of the many students who contacted The Root, noted: \u201cThe campus put up lights and emergency stations around campus to make sure students are safe.\u201d She added, \u201cMany of them\u2014I\u2019m standing in front of one of the emergency stations right now\u2014just don\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the Feb. 20 town hall, after a female student described her campus sexual assault and the university\u2019s lack of response, instead of displaying empathy for the alleged victim or issuing an apology, President Harvey chose to interrupt and attack the student in an exchange shared on social media, despite Harvey\u2019s insistence that students not record the proceedings:\n\nIn a statement about the summit, the university noted that it \u201cappreciates the bravery of students who come forward to address the important issue of sexual assault.\u201d It added:\n\nThe University empathizes with these students and considers this a very important matter. The Title IX Coordinator was present at the meeting and provided the group with an overview of the process. She agreed to provide students with additional educational sessions so they understand the process and feel comfortable with reporting incidents.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the town hall, the student collective asked that Harvey-Viney resign her position as Hampton\u2019s Title IX program coordinator or be reassigned to another department, citing her relationship with the president and what they see as a conflict of interest.\n\nAfter witnessing this display of appreciation and empathy, why would any victim of sexual misconduct feel uneasy about taking any complaints to the daughter of this man?\n\nAside from the unsafe, nonworking lights and call stations, the conditions of facilities on campus have deteriorated into what some campus dwellers feel are hazardous. Students report rampant mold in dorms and unsanitary conditions in the student cafeteria.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStudents report that maintenance requests often go unanswered, and the prevailing narrative is that the campus food-service department doesn\u2019t care about cleanliness or the quality of the food.\n\n\u201cI am not a picky eater, but my friends and I bring our own silverware to the cafeteria,\u201d said Burton, who has lived on campus for four years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA follow-up report by the Student Government Association relayed: \u201cAs it relates to the current state of the dining hall, a picture was circulated by a female student which showed bugs on an apple pie tartlet. The bugs were not found until after the student left the dining hall. Therefore, it is not known when the bugs got on the dessert.\u201d\n\nIn response, Doretha Spells, Hampton University\u2019s vice president for business affairs and treasurer, noted that neither the dining hall nor Gourmet Services has failed an inspection, and pointed to a planned renovation of facilities, including the dining area.\n\nAfter the heated Feb. 20 meeting, the administration at Hampton issued a list of proposals that it hoped would address the reported issues. But students felt that the administration\u2019s response was eerily familiar to the previous ways it ignored the concerns. The students decided to counter the proposals with their own manifesto outlining their grievances.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey followed this with a silent march through campus that ended on Harvey\u2019s front lawn and was attended by hundreds of enrollees at the school. In addition, students are using social media to protest and highlight the inaction and indifference at their university.\n\nAlthough the issues might seem trivial to some, the motivation to protest and change the community of which they are a part is not only laudable but also an important part of the educational process for those who will likely become the next generation of leaders.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to invite President Harvey to eat in the cafeteria for one week,\u201d Burton said. \u201cI would love to see him live in the dorms for seven days straight.

Ryan was hit with theft charges after \u201ca misunderstanding with a school resource officer over a 65-cent carton of milk.\u201d\n\nThat incident, in which the middle schooler claimed that he had forgotten the carton of milk that came with his free lunch, ended with Ryan being suspended from school and receiving a summons to juvenile court.\n\nCarroll Foy, a Democrat from Prince William County, spoke with the NAACP last week about proposed legislation that would make it so that students are less likely to wind up in jail or in the courts. According to the Post, Foy said she plans to sponsor more than 10 criminal-justice reform bills this legislative session.\n\nThe proposed changes include a bill that would raise the threshold for grand larceny in Virginia from a theft of $200, one of the lowest in the country, to $1,000. The low threshold means that stealing a jacket or bicycle can land a student a felony charge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFoy explained that raising the threshold could protect kids who make poor choices from instantly becoming convicted felons.\n\n\u201cThe punishment should fit the crime,\u201d Foy said. \u201cFelonies should be reserved for some of the most egregious crimes in the commonwealth of Virginia, and that\u2019s not happening.\u201d\n\n\n\nMore proposed bills include H.B. 445, which would do away with the requirement that principals report certain misdemeanor crimes to law enforcement. Ryan, the eighth-grader, was originally charged with a misdemeanor after the incident over the milk carton.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, two more bills sponsored by other Virginia lawmakers would prevent preschools and elementary schools from suspending and expelling students up through the third grade unless it was for drug offenses, firearm offenses or certain criminal acts.\n\nIn 2015 the Center for Public Integrity found that Virginia referred nearly 16 students per 1,000 to police or the courts\u2014the highest such rate in the country. However, a follow-up study from Virginia Tech last year revealed that, of the students who were \u201creported\u201d to the police, only 14 percent actually ended up before a juvenile-intake officer.\n\nThe Virginia Tech study did confirm that students with disabilities were disproportionately more likely to be taken out of school (either through suspension or expulsion), as were black students. Black students make up slightly less than a quarter of Virginia\u2019s student population, yet make up nearly half of all referrals to juvenile courts from schools.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGerard Lawson, an associate professor at Virginia Tech\u2019s School of Education who led the research, noted that a single suspension makes a high school graduation less likely, and \u201cinvolvement with the court system makes that less likely still.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe repercussions,\u201d Lawson said, \u201ccan be lifelong.\u201d\n\nRead more at the Washington Post.", "keywords": ["dismantle", "proposed", "lawmakers", "virginias", "post", "students", "bills", "ryan", "threshold", "school", "likely", "pipeline", "virginia", "schooltoprison"], "polarity": 0.07128672745694024, "subjectivity": 0.4377051671732523},

Faced with a maelstrom of criticism over the school\u2019s perceived apathy and lack of concern for the constituents of the heralded Virginia school, the Pirates of Hampton now face a quiet mutiny that has not only manifested itself on campus but has also spilled over onto social media and the public eye.\n\nHampton trails only Spelman College and Howard University on U.S. News & World Report\u2019s 2018 list of the best HBCUs in America. Founded in 1868, the liberal arts institution of more than 4,600 students is always included in the list of historically black schools known as the \u201cblack Ivy League.\u201d\n\nOn Feb. 20, Hampton students, frustrated by a number of unaddressed issues, held a town hall meeting to confront the school administration\u2019s seeming indifference to the concerns repeatedly raised by various groups at the school. According to several Hampton students who spoke with The Root, the airing of grievances quickly turned contentious when students felt that Hampton\u2019s leadership was ignoring and belittling their concerns.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the more important issues mentioned at the protests and by the students who reached out to The Root was what the students described as a prevailing culture of sexual assault on campus and the administration\u2019s perceived unwillingness to address the issue.\n\n\n\nEach freshman and transfer to Hampton is required to take a course called University 101, focused on the tradition of the college. According to the university, the U101 course covers test anxiety, personal finance, the dress code and even the alma mater. The student catalog describes the University 101 course as:\n\nA one-semester required orientation course designed to improve the quality of the freshman experience for entering students by helping them understand the purpose and value of higher education at Hampton University, as well as the larger context in which that education takes place and the multicultural nature of the problems and concerns which it addresses; to develop positive attitudes toward the teaching learning process; and to acquire coping skills essential for successful college life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite the school\u2019s past problems with sexual assault, including a 2014 case of a faculty member allegedly assaulting a student and a report that the school is being investigated by the Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Division for violating Title IX campus sexual-violence policies, Hampton still lags behind other schools in informing students about sexual assault on campus.\n\nFor comparison, since 2014, Howard University has mandated that all freshmen take Title IX training. According to student organizers, Hampton, in its University 101 course, has chosen to solve its campus problem of sexual misconduct in a unique way:\n\nBy not addressing it at all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven more troubling, Hampton\u2019s coordinator for Title IX\u2014the law that protects against sexual discrimination in any institution that receives federal funding\u2014is Kelly Harvey-Viney, the daughter of Hampton\u2019s president of 40 years, William Harvey.\n\n\n\nStudents have complained that her position may conflict with the interests of victims of assault at the school, noting that some students may be reluctant to step forward to complain about rape and sexual assault if the Title IX program is headed by someone more interested in protecting the reputation of the university and its president. In a letter to the administration, the HU Student Collective proposed that the Title IX process for reporting sexual misconduct and understanding consent be embedded in the University 101 course.\n\nKimberly Burton, a graduating senior at Hampton and one of the many students who contacted The Root, noted: \u201cThe campus put up lights and emergency stations around campus to make sure students are safe.\u201d She added, \u201cMany of them\u2014I\u2019m standing in front of one of the emergency stations right now\u2014just don\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the Feb. 20 town hall, after a female student described her campus sexual assault and the university\u2019s lack of response, instead of displaying empathy for the alleged victim or issuing an apology, President Harvey chose to interrupt and attack the student in an exchange shared on social media, despite Harvey\u2019s insistence that students not record the proceedings:\n\nIn a statement about the summit, the university noted that it \u201cappreciates the bravery of students who come forward to address the important issue of sexual assault.\u201d It added:\n\nThe University empathizes with these students and considers this a very important matter. The Title IX Coordinator was present at the meeting and provided the group with an overview of the process. She agreed to provide students with additional educational sessions so they understand the process and feel comfortable with reporting incidents.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the town hall, the student collective asked that Harvey-Viney resign her position as Hampton\u2019s Title IX program coordinator or be reassigned to another department, citing her relationship with the president and what they see as a conflict of interest.\n\nAfter witnessing this display of appreciation and empathy, why would any victim of sexual misconduct feel uneasy about taking any complaints to the daughter of this man?\n\nAside from the unsafe, nonworking lights and call stations, the conditions of facilities on campus have deteriorated into what some campus dwellers feel are hazardous. Students report rampant mold in dorms and unsanitary conditions in the student cafeteria.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStudents report that maintenance requests often go unanswered, and the prevailing narrative is that the campus food-service department doesn\u2019t care about cleanliness or the quality of the food.\n\n\u201cI am not a picky eater, but my friends and I bring our own silverware to the cafeteria,\u201d said Burton, who has lived on campus for four years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA follow-up report by the Student Government Association relayed: \u201cAs it relates to the current state of the dining hall, a picture was circulated by a female student which showed bugs on an apple pie tartlet. The bugs were not found until after the student left the dining hall. Therefore, it is not known when the bugs got on the dessert.\u201d\n\nIn response, Doretha Spells, Hampton University\u2019s vice president for business affairs and treasurer, noted that neither the dining hall nor Gourmet Services has failed an inspection, and pointed to a planned renovation of facilities, including the dining area.\n\nAfter the heated Feb. 20 meeting, the administration at Hampton issued a list of proposals that it hoped would address the reported issues. But students felt that the administration\u2019s response was eerily familiar to the previous ways it ignored the concerns. The students decided to counter the proposals with their own manifesto outlining their grievances.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey followed this with a silent march through campus that ended on Harvey\u2019s front lawn and was attended by hundreds of enrollees at the school. In addition, students are using social media to protest and highlight the inaction and indifference at their university.\n\nAlthough the issues might seem trivial to some, the motivation to protest and change the community of which they are a part is not only laudable but also an important part of the educational process for those who will likely become the next generation of leaders.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to invite President Harvey to eat in the cafeteria for one week,\u201d Burton said. \u201cI would love to see him live in the dorms for seven days straight. The school\u2019s response isn\u2019t a way to fix these problems. It\u2019s a way to shut us up.

She was disappointed, she said, but also relieved.\n\n\u201cAll this stuff I\u2019ve been saying is finally coming to light,\u201d she said. \u201cThe stuff keeps happening, and the school keeps pushing it under the rug like our school is pitch-perfect, peachy keen, but it\u2019s not, and people need to realize how Pleasant Grove really is.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, the viral video was one of many racist incidents that have happened at the Sacramento County high school since school started in August.\n\nIn September, Rachael says, she was walking home from school when a truck full of white kids, most of them boys, drove past.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI was just minding my business, and then a car with a group of white kids sticks out their heads and calls me the n-word with a hard \u2018r,\u2019 zooms away, and I\u2019m just there like, \u2018Well, what do I do?\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nAmong the other anti-black attacks Rachael says have happened in this school year alone: Nooses were found hanging from trees at the school\u2019s campus. Another white student ran into the classrooms and said, \u201cKill all the niggers.\u201d A white student peed on the car of a black teen, who didn\u2019t attend Pleasant Grove, in the school parking lot.\n\nRachael notes that the student who urinated on the car is still at school.\n\n\u201cI see him every day,\u201d she told the Bee. \u201cI don\u2019t feel safe because all these kids are walking around, and you don\u2019t know what they are going to do next.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough many of the incidents Rachael describes appear to involve white students, they\u2019re actually not the majority at Pleasant Grove. White students make up the biggest racial group, at 38 percent, but Asians and Latinx students make up 22.4 percent and 18.5 percent of the student body, respectively.\n\nBlack students make up just 6.8 percent of the student population, at 174.\n\nAll told, Pleasant Grove is majority students of color\u2014but this hasn\u2019t stopped vile anti-black racism from being a regular occurrence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA spokesperson from Elk Grove Unified School District, Xanthi Pinkerton, confirmed to the Bee that Rachael and other black students at Pleasant Grove have raised concerns about racism at the school, and claims that the administration has taken steps to remedy the problems, including disciplining some of the students involved.\n\nBut Rachael says that her efforts to curtail the problem\u2014which included writing a letter to school faculty and administrators\u2014have made her a target for administrators. Two other black students co-wrote the letter.\n\n\u201cThe amount of disrespect black students face at this school is disturbing, and the problem is only getting worse,\u201d the three girls wrote. \u201cYou can stop reading here, throw this paper away, or not, but if you do, just realize that you are now aware of the issues that take place inside these walls and are deciding to ignore them.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe letter, which was sent to faculty and staff in September, also asked that the school notify students about racist attacks on campus and educate its students about racism.\n\nAfter she shared the letter, Rachael told the Bee, administrators harassed her, saying that she just wanted attention. It\u2019s this tension between her and administrators, she says, that has made the 17-year-old\u2019s senior year at Pleasant Grove the \u201cworst\u201d she\u2019s gone through.\n\nLes Simmons, a pastor who has helped Rachael, says that Pleasant Grove should have heeded the letter\u2014and that the embarrassing viral video, as well as the expulsion of one of its students, might not have happened if administrators had taken the letter seriously.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere has to be some change in the administration, some change in the staff, to pay attention, to listen and to respond,\u201d Simmons told the Bee. \u201cAsking themselves, \u2018What are we doing to wrap our arms around the black community?\u2019 Not just disciplining a person for their comments.\u201d\n\nRead more at the Sacramento Bee.", "keywords": ["grove", "bee", "went", "told", "pleasant", "student", "school", "months", "white", "viral", "racist", "rachael", "warned", "video", "high", "black", "students"], "polarity": 0.050528169014084516, "subjectivity": 0.5021397616468037},

Faced with a maelstrom of criticism over the school\u2019s perceived apathy and lack of concern for the constituents of the heralded Virginia school, the Pirates of Hampton now face a quiet mutiny that has not only manifested itself on campus but has also spilled over onto social media and the public eye.\n\nHampton trails only Spelman College and Howard University on U.S. News & World Report\u2019s 2018 list of the best HBCUs in America. Founded in 1868, the liberal arts institution of more than 4,600 students is always included in the list of historically black schools known as the \u201cblack Ivy League.\u201d\n\nOn Feb. 20, Hampton students, frustrated by a number of unaddressed issues, held a town hall meeting to confront the school administration\u2019s seeming indifference to the concerns repeatedly raised by various groups at the school. According to several Hampton students who spoke with The Root, the airing of grievances quickly turned contentious when students felt that Hampton\u2019s leadership was ignoring and belittling their concerns.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the more important issues mentioned at the protests and by the students who reached out to The Root was what the students described as a prevailing culture of sexual assault on campus and the administration\u2019s perceived unwillingness to address the issue.\n\n\n\nEach freshman and transfer to Hampton is required to take a course called University 101, focused on the tradition of the college. According to the university, the U101 course covers test anxiety, personal finance, the dress code and even the alma mater. The student catalog describes the University 101 course as:\n\nA one-semester required orientation course designed to improve the quality of the freshman experience for entering students by helping them understand the purpose and value of higher education at Hampton University, as well as the larger context in which that education takes place and the multicultural nature of the problems and concerns which it addresses; to develop positive attitudes toward the teaching learning process; and to acquire coping skills essential for successful college life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite the school\u2019s past problems with sexual assault, including a 2014 case of a faculty member allegedly assaulting a student and a report that the school is being investigated by the Department of Education\u2019s Civil Rights Division for violating Title IX campus sexual-violence policies, Hampton still lags behind other schools in informing students about sexual assault on campus.\n\nFor comparison, since 2014, Howard University has mandated that all freshmen take Title IX training. According to student organizers, Hampton, in its University 101 course, has chosen to solve its campus problem of sexual misconduct in a unique way:\n\nBy not addressing it at all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven more troubling, Hampton\u2019s coordinator for Title IX\u2014the law that protects against sexual discrimination in any institution that receives federal funding\u2014is Kelly Harvey-Viney, the daughter of Hampton\u2019s president of 40 years, William Harvey.\n\n\n\nStudents have complained that her position may conflict with the interests of victims of assault at the school, noting that some students may be reluctant to step forward to complain about rape and sexual assault if the Title IX program is headed by someone more interested in protecting the reputation of the university and its president. In a letter to the administration, the HU Student Collective proposed that the Title IX process for reporting sexual misconduct and understanding consent be embedded in the University 101 course.\n\nKimberly Burton, a graduating senior at Hampton and one of the many students who contacted The Root, noted: \u201cThe campus put up lights and emergency stations around campus to make sure students are safe.\u201d She added, \u201cMany of them\u2014I\u2019m standing in front of one of the emergency stations right now\u2014just don\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the Feb. 20 town hall, after a female student described her campus sexual assault and the university\u2019s lack of response, instead of displaying empathy for the alleged victim or issuing an apology, President Harvey chose to interrupt and attack the student in an exchange shared on social media, despite Harvey\u2019s insistence that students not record the proceedings:\n\nIn a statement about the summit, the university noted that it \u201cappreciates the bravery of students who come forward to address the important issue of sexual assault.\u201d It added:\n\nThe University empathizes with these students and considers this a very important matter. The Title IX Coordinator was present at the meeting and provided the group with an overview of the process. She agreed to provide students with additional educational sessions so they understand the process and feel comfortable with reporting incidents.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the town hall, the student collective asked that Harvey-Viney resign her position as Hampton\u2019s Title IX program coordinator or be reassigned to another department, citing her relationship with the president and what they see as a conflict of interest.\n\nAfter witnessing this display of appreciation and empathy, why would any victim of sexual misconduct feel uneasy about taking any complaints to the daughter of this man?\n\nAside from the unsafe, nonworking lights and call stations, the conditions of facilities on campus have deteriorated into what some campus dwellers feel are hazardous. Students report rampant mold in dorms and unsanitary conditions in the student cafeteria.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStudents report that maintenance requests often go unanswered, and the prevailing narrative is that the campus food-service department doesn\u2019t care about cleanliness or the quality of the food.\n\n\u201cI am not a picky eater, but my friends and I bring our own silverware to the cafeteria,\u201d said Burton, who has lived on campus for four years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA follow-up report by the Student Government Association relayed: \u201cAs it relates to the current state of the dining hall, a picture was circulated by a female student which showed bugs on an apple pie tartlet. The bugs were not found until after the student left the dining hall. Therefore, it is not known when the bugs got on the dessert.\u201d\n\nIn response, Doretha Spells, Hampton University\u2019s vice president for business affairs and treasurer, noted that neither the dining hall nor Gourmet Services has failed an inspection, and pointed to a planned renovation of facilities, including the dining area.\n\nAfter the heated Feb. 20 meeting, the administration at Hampton issued a list of proposals that it hoped would address the reported issues. But students felt that the administration\u2019s response was eerily familiar to the previous ways it ignored the concerns. The students decided to counter the proposals with their own manifesto outlining their grievances.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey followed this with a silent march through campus that ended on Harvey\u2019s front lawn and was attended by hundreds of enrollees at the school. In addition, students are using social media to protest and highlight the inaction and indifference at their university.\n\nAlthough the issues might seem trivial to some, the motivation to protest and change the community of which they are a part is not only laudable but also an important part of the educational process for those who will likely become the next generation of leaders.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to invite President Harvey to eat in the cafeteria for one week,\u201d Burton said. \u201cI would love to see him live in the dorms for seven days straight. The school\u2019s response isn\u2019t a way to fix these problems. It\u2019s a way to shut us up. It\u2019s almost like resistance is futile.\u201d\n\nBut resistance isn\u2019t futile.\n\nIt\u2019s necessary.", "keywords": ["sexual", "president", "hampton", "student", "mutiny", "university", "campus", "school", "title", "students", "assault"], "polarity": 0.19534604978354983, "subjectivity": 0.5184798881673881},

Consider a town where there\u2019s an HBCU.\n\n\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t realize that it wasn\u2019t normal for your barber to live next to your professor until I left Grambling [in Louisiana],\u201d said Grambling State University President Richard Gallot Jr.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf there\u2019s anyone who can attest to the benefits of growing up in a city with an HBCU, it\u2019s Gallot. He grew up in Grambling (current population 5,000), where his father was the town barber and mayor. His mother chaired the university\u2019s history department. Gallot graduated from Grambling in 1987 and leveraged his HBCU degrees (also a Juris Doctor from Southern University in 1990) to become a state representative for the area in 2000 and state senator in 2012 before being installed as the 10th president of GSU in 2016.\n\n\u201cGrowing up in the small city of Grambling, I got to see [the] Alvin Ailey dance troupe at the university, go to hip-hop concerts, and see nationally televised productions of our football team and marching band,\u201d Gallot added. \u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine a better place to grow and raise a family.\u201d\n\n\n\nNevertheless, more people and companies are deciding to settle in much larger cities. After white flight, an extended retreat from cities after World War II, the migration back to urban areas over the last decade has been stimulating economic growth and technological innovation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor instance, research from the think tank the Brookings Institution, where I am a Rubinstein fellow, found that big cities gained more people in the three-plus years after the 2010 census than in the entire previous decade.\n\nSince then, a surge of innovation, information sharing and job creation has made cities more attractive for families and businesses alike. Urbanization, however, drives up housing costs, intensifies traffic congestion, creates more noise and can push out long-standing, low-income residents.\n\n\n\nYet for all the advantages that cities offer, many people\u2014and companies\u2014are looking for a balance. They want the conveniences and opportunities of a big city as well as the coziness of a suburb or small town. Some companies are helping to create what they\u2019re looking for in the suburbs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s desired downtown is being transferred to suburban environments to attract a suburban workforce,\u201d said Scott Marshall, executive managing director for investor leasing at CBRE Group.\n\n\n\nAs business investors look for places to invest capital for future financial, social and technological returns and governments leverage tax policy, both should look at what small- and medium-sized majority-black cities have to offer. Investors should pay particular attention to cities that have an HBCU.\n\nAbout half the nation\u2019s HBCUs reside in majority-black cities. Historically, black colleges and universities aren\u2019t only great places for people to get an education; they provide a foundation for population growth and economic development.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a new study I authored for Brookings, I looked at the median black household income in all majority-black cities in the country and compared them with the nationwide median household income across all races. I divided the more than 1,200 majority-black cities in percentiles according to income, and color-coded the cities with an HBCU.\n\nHBCUs stand out in the upper half of the income distribution of all black cities. An HBCU seems to increase incomes, though the presence of a black college isn\u2019t enough to push incomes above national averages. However, a case can certainly be made that HBCUs are competitive assets, especially for small- and medium-sized black cities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike other universities, HBCUs can leverage specialized-degree programs and students to support local economies. The difference is that companies today are looking to diversify their workforces. Why not meet black and brown students where they are concentrated? Clearly, you can\u2019t easily move a brick-and-mortar college to be close to an individual employer, but employers can set up shop near HBCUs.\n\n\n\nIn another new study commissioned by the United Negro College Fund, a nonprofit committed to increasing the total annual number of African-American college graduates, researchers found other economic benefits that help make the case for investing in cities with HBCUs.\n\nFor instance, they generate $14.8 billion annually, and their graduates fill 134,090 jobs. Their more than 50,000 graduates in 2014 can expect total earnings of $130 billion over their lifetimes, 56 percent more than those who didn\u2019t earn their college credentials, according to the study.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though tech companies admit they need to diversify their workforces, there is a narrative that small towns don\u2019t have the talent to fill positions. But consider those towns with HBCUs. Even though HBCUs make up just 3 percent of colleges and universities in the U.S., they account for 27 percent of African-American students with bachelor\u2019s degrees in STEM (science, technology, engineering or math) fields, according to the U.S. Department of Education.\n\nLast year at the Bayou Classic, the annual football game between the Grambling State University Tigers and Southern University Jaguars, technology teams representing each of the six historically black colleges and universities in Louisiana competed for $20,000 in prize money to show who could create the best \u201cpiece of technology that assists in the economic recovery of small businesses affected by natural disaster,\u201d according to the Biz Tech Challenge press release.\n\nThe team from Grambling won the competition. But the stakes are so much higher than a football game or pitch competition.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe can create a new economic development model in which HBCUs sit in the center of the plan,\u201d said Gallot. \u201cThe only thing stopping investors from seeing the potential of Grambling is the negative assumptions about black people, universities and cities.\u201d\n\nIn the neighboring town of Ruston, La., Louisiana Tech University, the Cyber Innovation Center and Louisiana Tech University formed a public-private partnership that has garnered millions of dollars in research funding.\n\nGiven the need for diversity in tech, we should see more of these kinds of partnerships between HBCUs and the tech world. However, I believe that the systemic devaluing of HBCUs and black cities stifles innovation and growth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis month, a federal judge ruled in favor of Maryland\u2019s public HBCUs in their claim that as a group of colleges, they\u2019ve been underfunded. Of the more than 100 majority-black cities where black median incomes exceed the national average among all races, about half of them are located in Maryland. Given the higher levels of prosperity in that state, the ruling gives Maryland an opportunity to invest more money in HBCUs that will have associated payoffs for black cities.\n\n\n\nHBCUs are thought of as a historical good, a social benefit for the black community, but maybe we should think of them as today\u2019s economic assets, which, if developed, will reap benefits for us all.\n\n\n\nThis story was produced by the Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education, in partnership with The Root.", "keywords": ["cities", "small", "black", "university", "revive", "economic", "grambling", "tech", "hbcus", "state", "universities"], "polarity": 0.07329256504013783, "subjectivity": 0.3624395830706509},

I cannot comment further, due to the ongoing school board investigation.\n\nVolitich, on top of hosting the podcast, also ran a Twitter and Goodreads account under the Dalichov pseudonym and, according to WFTS-TV, appears to have contributed to \u201calt-right\u201d websites like Halsey News under that name as well.\n\nWhich is to say, Volitich developed an entire brand out of her Dalichov alias\u2014a hell of a commitment to satire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s a (nonexhaustive and incomplete) recap of Volitich\u2019s satirical hot takes and anecdotes, all of which are things she either directly tweeted or stated on her podcast:\n\nEmphatically agreed with a guest who dismissed the idea that a kid from Nigeria and a kid from Sweden could \u201clearn the same\u201d and have the \u201csame IQ.\u201d\n\nArgued that science proves certain races are more intelligent than others.\n\nRecounted a story about her principal following up with her about a parent complaint that she had injected political bias into her teaching.\n\nAdmitted she had lied to the principal and said the claim \u201cwasn\u2019t true.\u201d\n\nTweeted that America\u2019s education system \u201cis designed to enable victimization when teachers are forced to learn about institutional racism.\u201d\n\nAgreed with a guest that white supremacists need to infiltrate schools and become teachers and said, \u201cI\u2019m absolutely one of them.\u201d\n\nTweeted that terrorism will continue unless Muslims are \u201ceradicated from the face of the earth.\u201d\n\nSaid on her podcast that she had put on a \u201cdog and pony\u201d show for administrators, telling her students that when administrators showed up, \u201cI\u2019m going to be different than I usually am. I just don\u2019t want you to be shocked, I want you to play along.\u201d\n\nTweeted that the \u201cJewish Question,\u201d or \u201cJQ,\u201d an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory, was \u201cincredibly complex.\u201d\n\nStarted a \u201cwhite privilege challenge,\u201d asking people to write in examples to prove white privilege is real, with a $100 reward.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVolitich now seems to claim that all of that was simply political \u201csatire and exaggeration\u201d to attract listeners and followers. Like Stephen Colbert, supposedly, but without the humor or wit. More than that, Volitich says that the views espoused under her pseudonym, an alias that she was comfortable accompanying with an actual photo of herself, have not been injected into her personal career\u2014despite her own repeated accounts.\n\nSo it\u2019s Tiana Dalichov who\u2019s a liar and not Volitich. What a joke indeed.\n\nThe Citrus County School District confirmed Sunday that it had removed Volitich from the classroom as it investigates the \u201cconcerning podcast.\u201d The district also wrote that because it was an open investigation, it could not discuss it or materials related to it until the process was complete.", "keywords": ["satire", "tiana", "nationalist", "school", "social", "teacher", "pseudonym", "political", "white", "florida", "dalichov", "podcast", "injected", "claims", "volitich"], "polarity": 0.07363945578231294, "subjectivity": 0.3388321995464853},

The world is not flat; dinosaurs didn\u2019t walk with humans; and white supremacy is built on a foundation of lies to preserve power and racial hierarchies. These are all facts. Unfortunately, some people either refuse to believe the undeniable or they have been purposely miseducated all together.\n\nTruth is power's greatest enemy.\n\nBlack educators give a collective side eye to the term \u201cpost-truth.\u201d Blacks and other racial groups have known for quite some time how agenda-setting is cloaked in fictitious narratives. The film The Birth of a Nation may have been the country\u2019s greatest teacher in this regard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is why professors and teachers whose jobs are to defend, pursue and teach truth are vulnerable to attack. When our truth-tellers lose jobs and/or security, community and education suffer. Tenure\u2014giving a teacher or professor an appointment until retirement\u2014provides a firewall of protection so that our professors and teachers can pursue what makes civilization progress without fear of institutional retribution.\n\nLet's be clear: Colleges and universities provide our nation with the intellectual by-products we use for our cultural and economic growth.\n\nBecause of the uniqueness of the educational enterprise, the academy must be free to direct, without outside interference, those functions that may challenge, but ultimately enrich, the culture they sustain. Because so many external agencies are wedded to the university system, universities must develop corporate structures that can respond to the demands of the public and protect against influences that seek to manipulate truth for personal and political gain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe American Association of University Professors\u2019 Statement on Government of Colleges and Universities is a guiding document as to how postsecondary institutions are governed. In the section External Relations of the Institution, the AAUP assigns the governing board as the legal voice of the institution, but reminds board members that faculty members can speak on their own behalf as citizens without fear of censure. This protection was codified under the 1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure.\n\nProtecting teachers is inextricably linked to protecting truth. So, it\u2019s inevitable that the post-truth and Black Lives Matter eras collide. Black professors and teachers are black people, too.\n\nThe casualties from the attacks on black work show up in who gets tenure and who does not.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProfessors, researchers and teachers of color are exposed by their criticism of institutional racism. The research on black and brown student success in college that\u2019s been done by black researchers over time is essential to understanding why coeds stay in college or leave early. But black professors\u2019 research is constantly debased as being \u201cme-search,\u201d meaning the researcher is too close and biased to investigate the issues fairly.\n\nColleges and universities aren't the only places where the battles to maintain and strengthen academic integrity and authenticity are being fought.\n\nJust as high school textbooks offered one-sided, nationalistic views on Reconstruction, McCarthyism and the Vietnam War, the fallout of a Trump victory will be felt in college and K-12 classrooms, as well. Certain education reformers relish painting disturbing pictures of corrupt, black school boards in urban districts that teach out-of-control students.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen these stories, rooted in systemic racism as they are, influence public sentiment, we see marginalized communities getting behind school-takeover strategies, harsh discipline policies, and white supremacist testing tactics. In the last decade, when so-called education reformers secured abilities to remove teacher protections in places like New Orleans and Washington, D.C., black women suffered more job losses than anyone else.\n\nThis institutional anti-blackness is timeless and by design.\n\nThe first standardized IQ tests were developed by eugenicist Lewis Terman, who \u201cimagined a permanent academic-achievement gap, a permanent racial hierarchy.\u201d While Terman\u2019s views of innate differences were dismissed, standardized tests were not, and their residuals lasted up till the release of Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray\u2019s The Bell Curve, another text that claimed innate differences.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe larger scientific community debunked their biased theories and methods\u2014and the mapping of the human genome in 2003 supposedly closed the door. However, closing the achievement gap became of raison d'etre of education reformers, and standardized tests again became in vogue. The tests we use to measure differences do more to affirm racial hierarchies than give disenfranchised groups what they need to succeed. The country isn\u2019t building institutions to close the Asian-white achievement gap for this reason.\n\nThe fix is in before black students even think about college, and a whitewashed, fickle academy does nothing but cause more harm.\n\nPower is truth's greatest enemy. Not only must educational institutions defend the practice of tenure; we must also vigorously protect tenured educators who expose America\u2019s biggest lie: the myth of white superiority.", "keywords": ["tests", "freedom", "education", "teachers", "professors", "tenure", "racial", "college", "institutions", "saving", "academic", "trumps", "posttruth", "truth", "nation", "black", "great", "universities"], "polarity": 0.08533535158535155, "subjectivity": 0.41665730665730666},

In the Unapologetic podcast, which Volitich hosts under the alias \u201cTiana Dalichov,\u201d Volitich brags about bringing her racist beliefs into her Crystal River Middle School classroom.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI get to talk about topics that people don\u2019t like to talk about,\u201d Volitich says in one snippet from her podcast, which HuffPost has embedded on its site. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to be seen as a bigot, racist, whatever you want to call it. I honestly don\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nThe screenshots (Volitich also posed as her \u201cTiana Dalichov\u201d alias on Twitter; her account has since been deleted, but as HuffPost knows, screenshots are forever) and podcasts reveal that Volitich certainly didn\u2019t care about being seen as a bigot\u2014in fact, she reveled in wildly racist, debunked beliefs.\n\nFrom HuffPost:\n\nIn her most recent podcast on Feb. 26, a guest railed against diversity in schools, dismissing the idea that \u201ca kid from Nigeria and a kid who came from Sweden are supposed to learn exactly the same\u201d and have the \u201csame IQ.\u201d Volitich enthusiastically agreed with the guest, and went on to argue that \u201cscience\u201d has proven that certain races are smarter than others.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLater in the episode, Volitich also agreed that white supremacists need to infiltrate schools:\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have to be vocal about their views, but get in there!\u201d her guest said. \u201cBe more covert and just start taking over those places.\u201d \u201cRight,\u201d Volitich said. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely one of them.\u201d\n\nAfter the HuffPost story came out, WFTS-TV in Tampa Bay found another article published on the far-right news site Halsey News under the headline \u201cTiana Dalichov: White Privilege Challenge.\u201d In it, Dalichov prompted people to write arguments proving \u201cone single instance of white privilege,\u201d for which she would give them $100.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHuffPost pieced together that Volitich was actually \u201cDalichov\u201d by lining up a series of coincidences. \u201cDalichov\u201d listed her home as Crystal River, which matches public records for Volitich\u2019s home. \u201cDalichov\u201d has shared on her podcast that she\u2019s a schoolteacher who has been teaching at her current school for one year. The same was true for Volitich and her position at Crystal River. \u201cDalichov\u201d tweeted that she was 25 years old, which is Volitich\u2019s age. And after HuffPost reached out to the Citrus County School District about Volitich, \u201cDalichov\u201d mentioned on her Twitter account that she would be going dark for a while.\n\n\n\nBut perhaps the clearest evidence is that Volitich, presumably part of the race that has higher IQs than others, posted an actual picture of herself as the avatar for her \u201cDalichov\u201d Twitter account. As HuffPost notes, not only does it appear to be the same person, but Volitich is also wearing the same earrings in her Twitter photo as she is in the Crystal River Middle School website.\n\nThe most disturbing part of HuffPost\u2019s revelations is that Volitch was consciously indoctrinating her students. As the article notes, the middle school social studies teacher says that her students knew her political beliefs and even helped \u201cplay along\u201d with administrators to help hide them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom one of her podcasts, according to WFTS-TV:\n\n\u201cI told the kids that. I said guys when they are in here I\u2019m going to be different than I usually am. I just don\u2019t want you to be shocked, I want you to play along and they\u2019re like OK. OK,\u201d she said in the podcast.\n\nLater in the podcast, after Volitich\u2019s guest asks her if the kids ever told their parents what they learned in class, she confirms that the principal once followed up with her over an email a parent had sent:\n\n\u201cI had one at the beginning of this year who emailed the principal over my head and basically told her I\u2019m worried that your teacher is injecting political bias into her teaching. And the principal came to me and she was like I\u2019m not worried, should I be worried? And I was like no. And she believed me and she backed off.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNearly 90 percent of Crystal River Middle School is white. The city of Crystal River itself is over 80 percent white, according to the latest census, with black people making up just over 7 percent of the population. Latinx residents account for another 5 percent.\n\n\n\nAs the HuffPost article notes, this isn\u2019t the first high-profile outing of a teacher\u2019s white nationalist identity. Late last year, Splinter News revealed that Greg Conte, a white supremacist who worked for Richard Spencer\u2019s think tank, the National Policy Institute, had gotten a job as an equal-employment officer. He also worked as a substitute teacher at a private high school in Maryland.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd in Louisiana, the principal of a charter school in New Orleans was fired after he was found wearing Nazi-associated rings in a video. He had also appeared on white nationalist podcasts.\n\nSince the story broke, people from around the country have taken to social media to demand that the school district fire Volitich. Neither the Citrus County School District, of which Crystal River is a part, nor Volitich has confirmed the HuffPost story, though the school has told the site that it \u201cwill be looking into the statements she made, checking the validity to see if they violate our code of ethics and policy.\u201d\n\n", "keywords": ["crystal", "river", "supremacist", "huffpost", "volitich", "teacher", "middle", "white", "florida", "dalichov", "podcast", "dont", "school", "outed", "unapologetic"], "polarity": 0.06521878121878123, "subjectivity": 0.31108824508824506},

In popular culture, HBCUs have provided the context for movies, such as School Daze and Drumline, and television series, such as A Different World and The Quad.\n\n\n\nMost of America\u2019s civil rights giants were educated at HBCUs, including Martin Luther King Jr., W.E.B. Du Bois, Rosa Parks, Booker T. Washington and Thurgood Marshall. In our time, Jesse Jackson, Andrew Young, Barbara Jordan, Rep. John Lewis, Marian Wright Edelman and Douglas Wilder all earned their degrees at HBCUs. Legendary artists and authors came out of HBCUs, such as Ralph Ellison, Alice Walker, Zora Neale Hurston, Langston Hughes and Toni Morrison.\n\n\n\nEven though our nation\u2019s HBCUs make up just 3 percent of colleges and universities, they produce 27 percent of African-American students with bachelor\u2019s degrees in science, technology, engineering and math fields and one-fourth of the bachelor\u2019s degrees in education awarded to African Americans.\n\nThis year, Morehouse College and eight other HBCUs are celebrating 150 years of service. In addition to Morehouse, the HBCUs that will celebrate their sesquicentennial in 2017 are Alabama State University, Barber-Scotia College (nonaccredited), Fayetteville State University, Howard University, Johnson C. Smith University, Morgan State University, St. Augustine\u2019s University and Talladega College. Eight of the nine continue to thrive as fully accredited institutions of higher education.\n\nAs one of many higher education options, HBCUs have also been subject to fair and unfair scrutiny from education consumers, policymakers, cultural critics and social commentators. Many people who critique HBCUs base their opinions on speculation, biases and myths. Using the most recent data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, this article addresses some of the most common myths about HBCUs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMyth 1: HBCUs have a declining enrollment.\n\nThe total enrollment of HBCUs has continued to make steady gains over the last two decades. According to the most recent data from IPEDS, the total enrollment of HBCUs collectively is 311,671, compared with 260,749 in 1990.\n\nSeventy-nine of the 105 HBCUs surveyed have a larger enrollment today than they did in 1990. Only 26 HBCUs have experienced enrollment declines since 1990, with percentage drops ranging from 1 percent to 55 percent. Twelve HBCUs showed a loss of more than 20 percent of their student population in comparisons between their enrollment of 2012 and their enrollment in 1990.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2013, three HBCUs had an enrollment of more than 10,000 students. There are 31 HBCUs with an enrollment of fewer than 1,000 students. While a large student enrollment is generally regarded as a positive indicator for a school, the ideal size for a university varies. Therefore, enrollment gains or losses over time are a more reliable indicator of an institution\u2019s health.\n\n\n\nMyth 2: HBCUs are losing enrollment because more black students are choosing predominantly white institutions.\n\nAlthough most HBCUs have grown enrollment since 1990, the data also reveals that the total gain in HBCU attendance has not outpaced the gains made in black students attending institutions of higher education, generally. However, HBCUs are not losing a lot of students to predominantly white institutions. HBCUs are generally more selective than they were 10 years ago, and are losing students to open-admissions community and for-profit colleges.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOver the past decade, state laws or board policies have restricted admissions at traditional four-year colleges based on the idea that students who are less academically prepared should begin their postsecondary matriculation at community colleges. These changes include setting a minimum ACT or SAT requirement for public universities or prohibiting public four-year colleges from offering remedial classes.\n\nIn tandem, some private HBCUs have lost enrollment because of governance issues and difficulties marketing the tuition against more affordable higher education options. Sixty-five of the 101 HBCUs that qualify for federal student financial aid have selective admissions, while the remaining 36 campuses have open admissions. Only four of the 34 open-admissions HBCUs are public.\n\n\n\nMyth 3: The ratio of women to men at HBCUs is something ridiculous, like 15-to-1.\n\nThe current ratio of black women to black men at HBCUs is 1.57-to-1. Of the 311,671 students who currently attend HBCUs, 121,414 are men and 190,257 are women. Coppin State University is the most skewed at 3.5-to-1. Almost 20 percent (19.5 percent) of all coed HBCUs have either an even split or have more men than women. For the three single-gender schools, Morehouse College has about as many men as the combined female population of Spelman College and Bennett College.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMyth 4: HBCUs have low graduation rates.\n\nThe average graduation rate for students across all four-year HBCUs is 42 percent\u2014slightly above the graduation rate for black students at all institutions, but less than half the rate of the most selective PWIs. The three universities with the highest graduation rates for black students within six years are Yale, Harvard and Princeton. For HBCUs, the top three are Spelman College, Howard University and Hampton University.\n\n\n\nHowever, analyses that evaluate the success of colleges and universities by observing their six-year cohort graduation rate can be illusive. On the surface, graduation rates tell us little about a college\u2019s or university\u2019s ability to educate a racially and economically diverse student body.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf the 23 colleges and universities in the nation that have a graduation rate for black students in the 90s, the average annual cost of tuition and fees is $43,700 and the average percent of the student body that is Pell-eligible is 15 percent. By contrast, only five HBCUs have an annual tuition greater than $20,000, and the average percent of the total HBCU enrollment that is Pell-eligible is 72.8 percent. In short, HBCU graduation rates reflect the chances they take to educate low-income students, not the quality of education they provide.\n\nMyth 5: HBCUs offer a substandard education, and many have accreditation issues.\n\nWhen it comes to producing black graduates who go on to earn Ph.D.s, HBCUs compete successfully with the nation\u2019s best universities, including Ivy League universities, elite private colleges and flagship state universities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nResearch demonstrates that HBCU graduates enjoy greater financial success in their careers, and U.S. rankings consistently show that HBCUs are among the top producers of students who continue their educations through graduate and professional schools. My own research indicates that for black students, HBCUs are clearly superior to predominantly white institutions for promoting positive student-faculty relationships and students\u2019 sense of belonging among STEM majors. According to a recent report from the National Science Foundation, 21 of the top 50 institutions for producing black graduates who go on to receive their doctorates in science and engineering are HBCUs.\n\nMyth 6: HBCUs have low endowments.\n\nThe average endowment across HBCUs that participate in federal Title IV funding is $27.7 million. Seven HBCUs have endowments that exceed $100 million: Howard University, Spelman College, Hampton University, Xavier University of Louisiana, Morehouse College, Meharry Medical College and Tuskegee University.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, some HBCUs have lower-than-desired endowments and need financial support from stakeholders. Fourteen four-year HBCUs have endowments that are less than $2 million, or less than 1 percent of the average endowment for all HBCUs.\n\nMyth 7: HBCUs suffered while President Obama was in office.\n\nThe federal government is responsible for nearly $5 billion of revenue annually to 101 HBCUs that qualify for federal support, through grants, contracts, appropriations and student aid. Across every indicator of federal support, revenue to HBCUs increased while President Barack Obama was in office. This data reflects the first six years that Obama was in office because the last two years are not yet available.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHBCUs received nearly $3 billion more from federal grants, contracts and appropriations in President Obama\u2019s first six years in office (2009-2014) than they did in President George W. Bush\u2019s last six years in office (2003-2008). The worst year of federal-grant revenue to HBCUs under Obama ($1.9 billion) tops the best year under Bush ($1.7 billion).\n\n\n\nOne of Obama\u2019s signature achievements was expanding the Pell Grant. When he entered office, HBCUs received approximately $536 million from the Pell program to support low-income college students. In his third year, HBCUs received approximately $867 million.\n\nHowever, Congress established a series of measures in 2010 to curb federal spending on the Pell program, including setting a six-year cap and ending support for summer school. Consequently, HBCUs lost Pell funding every year between 2010 and 2014. When accounting for profits and losses, HBCUs netted a $200 million gain in Pell during President Obama\u2019s years in office, with a $330 million gain occurring in his second and third year.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFederal student loans followed a similar trend. The Department of Education took steps early in Obama\u2019s administration to control lending, which had immediate benefits to HBCUs. In Obama\u2019s second year, the total amount that HBCUs received from federal student loan programs for undergraduates increased by more than $100 million. However, changes in the Federal Direct PLUS Loan Program made tens of thousands of HBCU students ineligible.\n\nThrough coordinated efforts, in October 2014, the Department of Education announced revised regulations of PLUS loans, which reversed most of the changes that had disproportionately impacted HBCUs. During the years that the changes to PLUS loans were in place, HBCUs lost approximately $55.8 million in loans. Accounting for this loss, HBCUs\u2019 revenue from all federal student loan programs increased by $117.8 million over the years Obama was in office.\n\nNotwithstanding HBCUs\u2019 success over several generations, many HBCUs have experienced financial hardships and administrative challenges. I do not challenge the myths associated with HBCUs to minimize legitimate concerns but, rather, to provide the best information to HBCU advocates who are genuinely interested in promoting HBCU growth and sustainability. Many detractors have used misinformation about HBCUs to question the relevancy of HBCUs.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUsing myths and misinformation to question the relevancy of HBCUs is not new. Last year I met the legendary president of Xavier University, Norman Francis. He told me that the year he became president of Xavier in 1968, someone asked him if HBCUs were still necessary.\n\nFor HBCUs to achieve greatness, they have to relinquish the posture of defending their relevance and get in the stance of asserting their excellence.", "keywords": ["enrollment", "education", "morehouse", "excellence", "student", "college", "federal", "university", "myths", "black", "150", "challenge", "destroying", "hbcus", "students", "million"], "polarity": 0.14786803386486944, "subjectivity": 0.43269425721957333},

In the Unapologetic podcast, which Volitich hosts under the alias \u201cTiana Dalichov,\u201d Volitich brags about bringing her racist beliefs into her Crystal River Middle School classroom.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI get to talk about topics that people don\u2019t like to talk about,\u201d Volitich says in one snippet from her podcast, which HuffPost has embedded on its site. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to be seen as a bigot, racist, whatever you want to call it. I honestly don\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nThe screenshots (Volitich also posed as her \u201cTiana Dalichov\u201d alias on Twitter; her account has since been deleted, but as HuffPost knows, screenshots are forever) and podcasts reveal that Volitich certainly didn\u2019t care about being seen as a bigot\u2014in fact, she reveled in wildly racist, debunked beliefs.\n\nFrom HuffPost:\n\nIn her most recent podcast on Feb. 26, a guest railed against diversity in schools, dismissing the idea that \u201ca kid from Nigeria and a kid who came from Sweden are supposed to learn exactly the same\u201d and have the \u201csame IQ.\u201d Volitich enthusiastically agreed with the guest, and went on to argue that \u201cscience\u201d has proven that certain races are smarter than others.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLater in the episode, Volitich also agreed that white supremacists need to infiltrate schools:\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have to be vocal about their views, but get in there!\u201d her guest said. \u201cBe more covert and just start taking over those places.\u201d \u201cRight,\u201d Volitich said. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely one of them.\u201d\n\nAfter the HuffPost story came out, WFTS-TV in Tampa Bay found another article published on the far-right news site Halsey News under the headline \u201cTiana Dalichov: White Privilege Challenge.\u201d In it, Dalichov prompted people to write arguments proving \u201cone single instance of white privilege,\u201d for which she would give them $100.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHuffPost pieced together that Volitich was actually \u201cDalichov\u201d by lining up a series of coincidences. \u201cDalichov\u201d listed her home as Crystal River, which matches public records for Volitich\u2019s home. \u201cDalichov\u201d has shared on her podcast that she\u2019s a schoolteacher who has been teaching at her current school for one year. The same was true for Volitich and her position at Crystal River. \u201cDalichov\u201d tweeted that she was 25 years old, which is Volitich\u2019s age. And after HuffPost reached out to the Citrus County School District about Volitich, \u201cDalichov\u201d mentioned on her Twitter account that she would be going dark for a while.\n\n\n\nBut perhaps the clearest evidence is that Volitich, presumably part of the race that has higher IQs than others, posted an actual picture of herself as the avatar for her \u201cDalichov\u201d Twitter account. As HuffPost notes, not only does it appear to be the same person, but Volitich is also wearing the same earrings in her Twitter photo as she is in the Crystal River Middle School website.\n\nThe most disturbing part of HuffPost\u2019s revelations is that Volitch was consciously indoctrinating her students. As the article notes, the middle school social studies teacher says that her students knew her political beliefs and even helped \u201cplay along\u201d with administrators to help hide them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom one of her podcasts, according to WFTS-TV:\n\n\u201cI told the kids that. I said guys when they are in here I\u2019m going to be different than I usually am. I just don\u2019t want you to be shocked, I want you to play along and they\u2019re like OK. OK,\u201d she said in the podcast.\n\nLater in the podcast, after Volitich\u2019s guest asks her if the kids ever told their parents what they learned in class, she confirms that the principal once followed up with her over an email a parent had sent:\n\n\u201cI had one at the beginning of this year who emailed the principal over my head and basically told her I\u2019m worried that your teacher is injecting political bias into her teaching. And the principal came to me and she was like I\u2019m not worried, should I be worried? And I was like no. And she believed me and she backed off.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNearly 90 percent of Crystal River Middle School is white. The city of Crystal River itself is over 80 percent white, according to the latest census, with black people making up just over 7 percent of the population. Latinx residents account for another 5 percent.\n\n\n\nAs the HuffPost article notes, this isn\u2019t the first high-profile outing of a teacher\u2019s white nationalist identity. Late last year, Splinter News revealed that Greg Conte, a white supremacist who worked for Richard Spencer\u2019s think tank, the National Policy Institute, had gotten a job as an equal-employment officer. He also worked as a substitute teacher at a private high school in Maryland.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd in Louisiana, the principal of a charter school in New Orleans was fired after he was found wearing Nazi-associated rings in a video. He had also appeared on white nationalist podcasts.\n\nSince the story broke, people from around the country have taken to social media to demand that the school district fire Volitich. Neither the Citrus County School District, of which Crystal River is a part, nor Volitich has confirmed the HuffPost story, though the school has told the site that it \u201cwill be looking into the statements she made, checking the validity to see if they violate our code of ethics and policy.\u201d\n\n", "keywords": ["crystal", "river", "supremacist", "huffpost", "volitich", "teacher", "middle", "white", "florida", "dalichov", "podcast", "dont", "school", "outed", "unapologetic"], "polarity": 0.06521878121878123, "subjectivity": 0.31108824508824506},

The show, which focuses on life at the fictional Georgia A&M University, seemingly offers a glimpse into life on the campus of an HBCU, but many have said that its portrayals grossly exaggerate what HBCU life is really about. Now its strongest rebuke has come in the form of a three-page letter from Hampton University\u2019s president.\n\nHBCU Digest published a copy of the Feb. 3 letter penned by Hampton President William R. Harvey on Hampton letterhead and addressed to BET President Debra Lee, in which Harvey slams the series for its misrepresentation of HBCU leadership, student culture and the challenges that HBCUs face.\n\nFrom his letter:\n\nDevoid of any reference to academics, The Quad is about a president who is promiscuous, trustees who are unwilling to deal with a rogue band director, and a band director who condones criminal activity on the part of his drum major. The Quad will lead many to believe that HBCUs exist because of their marching bands; that our presidents are unethical; that our boards are dysfunctional and have misplaced priorities; that our faculty, students and administrators are driven by sex, alcohol, marijuana, low self-esteem, parties and a preoccupation with music; that it is acceptable to disrespect women; that university policy can be set by a band director; and that there are no standards of conduct or penalties for bad behavior. This depiction seems more analogous to a disgruntled, adolescent and unrealistic point of view that some may have. It also feeds a false narrative about the irrelevance of HBCUs. We cannot afford this kind of storytelling. It amounts to the type of \u2018fake news\u2019 that is prevalent today. You see, all that most people know about HBCUs is what they see on television. What I saw on BET February 1st was not accurate; rather, it was a bogus representation of very important and historic institutions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHBCU Digest\u2019s Jarrett Carter Sr. agrees with Harvey\u2019s assessment, writing that the show has \u201cattracted a growing audience by being well-stocked on drama, but low on its promise to showcase \u2018real HBCU culture\u2019 through Georgia A&M University\u2019s mantra of \u2018Pride, Tradition and Excellence.\u2019\u201d\n\nSeveral HBCU presidents have reportedly written to Harvey and commended him for writing the letter in response to the negative images presented in The Quad.\n\nCarter writes that the reactions to the show were easy to see coming. From HBCU Digest:\n\nWe knew from the first episode that this was not a good look for our schools. We knew that when actors began defending \u201cThe Quad\u201d as a \u201chuman\u201d show that just happens to take place at an HBCU, we were in for a controversial debut season. And now we know that the G.O.A.T. of HBCU leadership hates it, along with a growing delegation of presidential peers. Only one thing can save \u201cThe Quad\u201d as a potential vehicle of support for black colleges; all of its creative directors and producers need to disclose just how bad this show is going to be for the remainder of the season, apologize publicly and commit to a stronger, more representative second season with thorough and unchallenged review of consultants who can do what test audiences obviously didn\u2019t; warn BET about the hell they were walking into during Black History Month.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI personally have not watched the show, but I\u2019ve seen enough criticism of it to want to stay away from it. Then again, when it comes to BET, I never, ever forgave them for that Cita the Cyber Chickenhead fiasco.\n\nRead more at HBCU Digest.", "keywords": ["quad", "slamming", "depiction", "hampton", "season", "life", "letter", "harvey", "university", "bet", "hbcu", "hbcus", "president", "pens"], "polarity": 0.04029069767441861, "subjectivity": 0.48178294573643415},

Bush and a current professor at Georgetown University Law Center, was nominated by President Donald Trump this week to sit on a federal commission that sets policy on how to punish criminals.\n\nIt would come as no surprise that Otis is a staunch supporter of Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 hard-line approach of imposing mandatory minimum sentences and resurrecting the war on drugs. But Otis, thanks to his popular legal blog, Crime and Consequences, has also made his racist beliefs both explicit and easily searchable.\n\nAs the Washington Post reports, Otis once defended a federal judge who was called out for saying that black and Latinx people were more violent than white people.\n\nIn a 2013 post he titled, \u201cThe PC Attempt to Intimidate Judges,\u201d Otis wrote:\n\nWhen Fifth Circuit Judge Edith Jones said at a University of Pennsylvania Law School talk that blacks and Hispanics are more violent than whites, a consortium of civil rights organizations filed a complaint. ... The complaint calls for stern discipline on the grounds that the remarks were \u201cdiscriminatory and biased.\u201d So far as I have been able to discover, it makes no mention of the fact that they\u2019re true.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the Post noted, Otis dug himself further into the racist-commentary trenches in the comments section, where Otis saw fit to compare black people to Asians, whom he called \u201cOrientals.\u201d\n\n\u201cOrientals,\u201d Otis claimed, have a lower incidence of crime than other groups because they have the right values. Here is that passage in full:\n\nThis is the reason that, for example, Orientals have less incidence of crime than whites. Orientals were unquestionably the victims of long and rancid racial bigotry; coolie labor was little more than slave labor. And Yick Wo v. Hopkins is one of the most famous civil rights cases of all time. The reason Orientals stay out of jail more than either whites or blacks is that family life, work, education and tradition are honored more in Oriental culture than in others.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis, of course, is flatly ahistorical. While Asian groups have certainly been discriminated against, that treatment simply cannot be compared to the history of anti-black racism in the U.S. \u201cCoolie labor,\u201d as Otis puts it (the term is dated and derogatory, and refers to Asian laborers) is not comparable to over 200 years of chattel slavery.\n\nIn the same post, Otis also flatly denied that white people\u2019s racial bigotry caused black people to \u201cmake ... more criminal choices.\u201d\n\nAs if trying to hit all the twisted, racist lines of \u201clogic\u201d that he could, Otis next brought up Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas as his example of a good black person with the \u201cright values\u201d:\n\nValues, not race or skin color, influence choices. Some of the bravest men in public life \u2014 Justice Clarence Thomas comes to mind \u2014 had the \u201cwrong\u201d skin color but the right values (see Thomas\u2019s autobiography, \u201cMy Grandfather\u2019s Son\u201d). They made honorable and courageous choices, and succeeded. This is one of the reasons the grievance-monger crowd \u2014 the people who now want to hammer Judge Jones \u2014 have a special hate for Justice Thomas.\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat Thomas\u2019 values apparently include perjury and harassment of women apparently evaded the Georgetown law professor.\n\nThe Post also found another blog from 2014 in which Otis referred to an offender sarcastically as \u201cMr. Nicey.\u201d The post was written in response to a bill called the \u201cSmarter Sentencing Act\u201d that would have reduced sentences for some drug and low-level offenders.\n\nHere\u2019s what he wrote:\n\nLast I looked, when you needle yourself with too much heroin, you\u2019re still dead; when a thug belts you to grab your purse, you still have a knot on your head and no purse; and when Mr. Nicey rapes your eight year-old, you still have a defiled little girl to try to help.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis bears repeating: Trump\u2019s pick for the U.S. Sentencing Commission, which determines what criminal sentences to dole out, has written that black and Latinx people commit more crimes because of their collective substandard values, and appears to think that selling an eighth of an ounce of weed (a low-level offense) is akin to child rape.\n\nThe comments that Otis has made on his blog aren\u2019t racist dog whistles. They\u2019re the air horn of racism. They\u2019re also terrifyingly recent\u2014all made within the last five years.\n\nOtis\u2019 nomination was announced on Thursday and is one of four that Trump made.

That special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into the president\u2019s collusion with Russia must be heating up. So far, Mueller\u2019s investigation has led to charges against Trump\u2019s campaign Chairman Paul Manafort, his aide Rick Gates, former foreign policy adviser to Trump\u2019s presidential campaign George Papadopoulos and Trump\u2019s national security adviser Michael Flynn. All four men have pleaded guilty to various charges.\n\nMueller has also charged Russian lawyer Alex van der Zwaan, who reportedly lied to federal investigators in the Russia probe in federal court on Feb. 16. He also pleaded guilty. Then there is Richard Pinedo, a California man who used stolen identities to sell bank accounts to Russians meddling in the election. Pinedo pleaded guilty, too. And let\u2019s not forget the 13 Russian nationals and three Russian companies that were indicted in February for allegedly interfering in the 2016 election. That\u2019s a ton of people to be charged, most of whom have already pleaded guilty, if there is no there there.\n\nBut why this tweet today, you ask? And why the obnoxious all caps?

In a closed-door interview, Hicks will be grilled as part of a separate investigation into alleged Russia interference in the 2016 election. Yes, there are multiple investigations into possible Russia collusion because, well, Russia colluded.\n\nHicks served as a spokesperson for Trump\u2019s campaign in 2016 before moving into her new role. Trump doesn\u2019t like when people mess with \u201cHopester,\u201d as he affectionately calls her. Clearly, Trump is worried that all of the Russian walls are closing in around him. You can always tell, whenever someone goes all caps, that they\u2019ve been triggered, and clearly this happened to Trump this morning. I assume that he tweeted this right before his morning ritual of sacrificing a baby goat and poking pins in his stuffed Obama doll.\n\n#StayWoke.", "keywords": ["election", "pleaded", "russia", "latest", "guilty", "morning", "trump", "investigation", "proves", "russian", "heating", "trumps", "president"], "polarity": -0.010199283475145537, "subjectivity": 0.47683982683982684},

I was the first child of my African immigrant parents to take ballet and gymnastic classes. I was their first Girl Scout, first overpriced prom experience and first recipient of their Parent Plus college loan. Together, we navigated mainstream America while eating Ghanaian food at home.\n\n\n\nI was confident in my cultural identity, but juxtaposed with my black American peers and white counterparts, whose customs were different from my own, my acquiescence into self-actualization at times was challenged. My coming-of age years were as diverse as a piping-hot pot of jollof rice.\n\nMy quaint family attended Ghanaian traditional baptisms and funerals adorned in kente cloth and other garb normalizing African culture in my New England neighborhood. Mom wrapped her hair in a duku head scarf similar to Ramonda in Black Panther. My cousins and I wore bright Ankara-print fabrics like Okoye, Nakia and Shuri as we served food and drinks at Ghanaian social events. My dad and uncles donned Entumas like Zuri, although they weren\u2019t used as protective shields, as they were for Black Panther\u2019s warriors. Our African attire wasn\u2019t a costume. My parents brought Ghana to small-town America.\n\nThree weeks into the Marvel movie\u2019s debut, filmgoers across the country have been flooding social media with pictures of themselves in African garb. Men, women and children across the Diaspora feel connected to the \u201cAfricanness\u201d of Black Panther, and it\u2019s a beautiful, melanin-filled sight to see.\n\nThe film connects black Americans to a continent that has ben positioned as mysterious, disease-infested and dark to the Western world. Moreover, most African Americans are descendants of the slave trade, whose African heritage, customs and religion were deliberately erased and replaced with a European system created by colonizers. Watching the two worlds marry in Hollywood matrimony is prime black pride.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the spirit of Black Panther and African pride, I\u2019d like my fellow blacks across the country to keep Africa closer to their hearts, like the way my parents kept Ghana close to our souls. How can we further connect to Africa beyond aesthetics? How can we sustain this feeling of Afrocentric bliss, ensuring that it doesn\u2019t become a fad?\n\nI spoke with Linda Heywood, a professor of African-American studies and history at Boston University, and Gina Paige, president and co-founder of African Ancestry, for historical context and action steps that African Americans can take toward living their best Wakanda lives from the inside out.\n\n[Editor\u2019s note: This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.]\n\nThe Root: Is this moment of African Americans connecting to Africa sustainable?\n\nPhoto: Boston University\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLinda Heywood: There always this need for more Africa, from W.E.B. Du Bois to Martin Luther King, and ... then you have the 1957 Ghana independence; that was the first step. In the 1980s and \u201990s, Africa kind of went underground in a certain way because the image we were seeing of Africa [was] so negative. So it\u2019s like this is a reawakening of the connection to Africa. I think that\u2019s excellent, but we need to sustain it.\n\nGina Paige: The entire community has benefited from the impact of Black Panther promoting pride in being of African descent. As more people want to celebrate their Africanness, they naturally want to find their own \u201cWakanda.\u201d We have seen an increased interest in people wanting to know which African country and tribe or ethnic group they share ancestry with.\n\nTR: How does finding your ancestry help with connecting to the continent?\n\nLH: There\u2019s a deep family connection [in finding your DNA]. People need to know they are connected to something. If you think, \u201cOh, I\u2019m the descendant of slaves,\u201d then you think, \u201cOh, I\u2019m not connected to anything,\u201d because slavery was a temporary status that went on far too long.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGP: African Americans want to connect with Africa because our histories were stolen from us through bondage. As a result of the trans-Atlantic slave trade, we lost our names, our languages, the freedom to honor our ancestors, and our families were sold apart. You cannot know who you are if you don\u2019t have any of those things. We don\u2019t know where we are from, and we cannot use genealogy records to find out. You cannot know who you are if you don\u2019t know where you are from.\n\nTR: How can we expect to feel knowing our biological background?\n\nLH: Why should we be always connected to slavery? We have to make our own interpretation. Don\u2019t let people put on us that status. Connecting to Africa is one way, but it\u2019s not the way out.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: African Ancestry\n\nGP: People feel all sorts of emotions upon receiving their results. They are overwhelmed, happy, surprised, proud, excited, curious and more. They immediately want to learn about the people and countries and share the information with their family members.\n\nTR: How can children learn more about Africa?\n\nLH: Not many students are learning about Africa. We have to get in those images. Not just for Black History Month. Not just Martin Luther King and Malcolm X. Junior high schoolers need to be brought into Africa in more realistic ways so that we have not just creative stories, but bring in the stories of real people who had to make real decisions and make choices. Rulers, whether they are female or male, have to make choices, and we have those elements for Europe. Let us have more for Africa. Teachers have to be able to put that into the curriculum.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: Where can the average adult start learning about the history of Africa?\n\nLH: Start by reading biographies. Be realistic in how you look at your African past history, your heroes and heroines. For men, there\u2019s Shaka Zulu (South Africa), Mansa Musa (West African Mali empire) and Asantehene (Ghana). For women, there\u2019s Nana Yaa Asantewaa (Ghana), Queen Amina (Nigeria), Queen Njinga (Angola).\n\nGP: Ethnic groups are extremely important to knowing who we are because they are the social factors that dictate culture. The top five tribes for African Americans are Fulani, Mende, Balanta, Yoruba and Tikar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: Beyond history, how else can we live our best Wakanda life in America?\n\nLH: We have to travel outside of the United States: Senegal, Ghana, Angola, Zambia, South Africa, Tanzania, Zanzibar. There are lots of sites in Africa. This is where the deep history is.\n\nGP: Take an African Ancestry test, travel, research; reading, listening to music; meet people from Africa who live in the United States; attend festivals; watch documentaries and films produced in African countries.

My parents brought Ghana to small-town America.\n\nThree weeks into the Marvel movie\u2019s debut, filmgoers across the country have been flooding social media with pictures of themselves in African garb. Men, women and children across the Diaspora feel connected to the \u201cAfricanness\u201d of Black Panther, and it\u2019s a beautiful, melanin-filled sight to see.\n\nThe film connects black Americans to a continent that has ben positioned as mysterious, disease-infested and dark to the Western world. Moreover, most African Americans are descendants of the slave trade, whose African heritage, customs and religion were deliberately erased and replaced with a European system created by colonizers. Watching the two worlds marry in Hollywood matrimony is prime black pride.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the spirit of Black Panther and African pride, I\u2019d like my fellow blacks across the country to keep Africa closer to their hearts, like the way my parents kept Ghana close to our souls. How can we further connect to Africa beyond aesthetics? How can we sustain this feeling of Afrocentric bliss, ensuring that it doesn\u2019t become a fad?\n\nI spoke with Linda Heywood, a professor of African-American studies and history at Boston University, and Gina Paige, president and co-founder of African Ancestry, for historical context and action steps that African Americans can take toward living their best Wakanda lives from the inside out.\n\n[Editor\u2019s note: This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.]\n\nThe Root: Is this moment of African Americans connecting to Africa sustainable?\n\nPhoto: Boston University\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLinda Heywood: There always this need for more Africa, from W.E.B. Du Bois to Martin Luther King, and ... then you have the 1957 Ghana independence; that was the first step. In the 1980s and \u201990s, Africa kind of went underground in a certain way because the image we were seeing of Africa [was] so negative. So it\u2019s like this is a reawakening of the connection to Africa. I think that\u2019s excellent, but we need to sustain it.\n\nGina Paige: The entire community has benefited from the impact of Black Panther promoting pride in being of African descent. As more people want to celebrate their Africanness, they naturally want to find their own \u201cWakanda.\u201d We have seen an increased interest in people wanting to know which African country and tribe or ethnic group they share ancestry with.\n\nTR: How does finding your ancestry help with connecting to the continent?\n\nLH: There\u2019s a deep family connection [in finding your DNA]. People need to know they are connected to something. If you think, \u201cOh, I\u2019m the descendant of slaves,\u201d then you think, \u201cOh, I\u2019m not connected to anything,\u201d because slavery was a temporary status that went on far too long.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGP: African Americans want to connect with Africa because our histories were stolen from us through bondage. As a result of the trans-Atlantic slave trade, we lost our names, our languages, the freedom to honor our ancestors, and our families were sold apart. You cannot know who you are if you don\u2019t have any of those things. We don\u2019t know where we are from, and we cannot use genealogy records to find out. You cannot know who you are if you don\u2019t know where you are from.\n\nTR: How can we expect to feel knowing our biological background?\n\nLH: Why should we be always connected to slavery? We have to make our own interpretation. Don\u2019t let people put on us that status. Connecting to Africa is one way, but it\u2019s not the way out.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: African Ancestry\n\nGP: People feel all sorts of emotions upon receiving their results. They are overwhelmed, happy, surprised, proud, excited, curious and more. They immediately want to learn about the people and countries and share the information with their family members.\n\nTR: How can children learn more about Africa?\n\nLH: Not many students are learning about Africa. We have to get in those images. Not just for Black History Month. Not just Martin Luther King and Malcolm X. Junior high schoolers need to be brought into Africa in more realistic ways so that we have not just creative stories, but bring in the stories of real people who had to make real decisions and make choices. Rulers, whether they are female or male, have to make choices, and we have those elements for Europe. Let us have more for Africa. Teachers have to be able to put that into the curriculum.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: Where can the average adult start learning about the history of Africa?\n\nLH: Start by reading biographies. Be realistic in how you look at your African past history, your heroes and heroines. For men, there\u2019s Shaka Zulu (South Africa), Mansa Musa (West African Mali empire) and Asantehene (Ghana). For women, there\u2019s Nana Yaa Asantewaa (Ghana), Queen Amina (Nigeria), Queen Njinga (Angola).\n\nGP: Ethnic groups are extremely important to knowing who we are because they are the social factors that dictate culture. The top five tribes for African Americans are Fulani, Mende, Balanta, Yoruba and Tikar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: Beyond history, how else can we live our best Wakanda life in America?\n\nLH: We have to travel outside of the United States: Senegal, Ghana, Angola, Zambia, South Africa, Tanzania, Zanzibar. There are lots of sites in Africa. This is where the deep history is.\n\nGP: Take an African Ancestry test, travel, research; reading, listening to music; meet people from Africa who live in the United States; attend festivals; watch documentaries and films produced in African countries.

Well, that is where people who have guns (read: tabacky-chewing, Hulk Hogan-loving Americans) sell guns to other Americans (read: mesh-hat-wearing, NASCAR-loving white men) with little to no requirements other than that said Budweiser-drinking American has the correct amount to purchase said firearm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe have to stop this nonsense,\u201d the president said.

Someone needs to start choking to end this meeting!\u201d A few members coughed, but no one actually faked a full choking scene.\n\n\u201cTake the guns first, go through due process second,\u201d Trump suggested.\n\n\n\nThe president then straight-up slammed Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), who is pushing a bill to broaden background checks. Trump asked Toomey if his plan included raising the minimum age to purchase a firearm from 18 to 21.

He tells his cousin Carlos (whom he eventually kills) that the rats are eating his money before he can get it out of the country and says, poignantly, about the rats eating the money, \u201cCarlos, this is a stupid problem; BUT, it is a problem.\u201d That\u2019s how I feel about the story I\u2019m about to share.\n\nAbout six months ago, in August, and a month after I left my very good government job, I got my ears pierced. It was something I\u2019d always wanted to do, and I had always used the excuse of my very professional job to get around the fact that I do not like pain and that I was, at the very least, a little bit afraid that getting my ears pierced would hurt.\n\nBut I put on my big-boy boxers and went to a tattoo parlor in New York City and got my ears pierced. It didn\u2019t hurt much, if at all, and I was happy and excited and thought I\u2019d immediately feel cooler. It turns out that I didn\u2019t feel one bit cooler. It was the same after I got my first tattoo. But now I\u2019m tatted up (I have two, with a sleeve to come) and my ears are pierced to the gawds.\n\nNow, anybody who has gotten their ears pierced knows that you have to keep the starter studs or whatever you want to call them in your ears for several weeks\u2014I can\u2019t remember how long\u2014after piercing.

You also have to keep them clean with various juices and berries and sea salts and shit. It\u2019s a thing. Anyway, I did everything I was supposed to do because the last thing I need is problems oblivious 18-year-olds have. Who am I kidding? ... Oblivious 12-year-olds.\n\nSo I did what I was supposed to, and I have to admit my ear-cleaning game has been stellar. I twisted, I cleaned, I was supposed to stop, but I can\u2019t (or couldn\u2019t, which is not true). I even bought me some new studs to put in my ear once my time was up. I got me some ultrablack round studs so I can look, in my head, how I\u2019d look when my ears were pierced.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter my time was up, I got myself prepared to take my studs out, happily, I might add. And then it happened. My damn screw-back earrings wouldn\u2019t unscrew. Like, I couldn\u2019t get them off. I put my back into it and everything but could not remove the damn earring backs to save my life. This was back in October. I know it was October because I bought the new black studs for a trip I was taking to New Orleans. But I figured, \u201cHey, I\u2019m going to New Orleans, maybe I\u2019ll get another tattoo down there\u201d\u2014I did\u2014\u201cand they\u2019ll be able to remove these godforsaken earrings at a tattoo parlor.\u201d\n\nBut they couldn\u2019t.

I\u2019ve dipped my ear in peroxide thinking that might erode or loosen up whatever has them stuck. I poured the amazingly effective WD-40 onto my earrings and nothing. I can\u2019t get the damn things out. I even tried Vaseline and vegetable oil. This, my friends, is a stupid problem. I know this, BUT, it is a problem.\n\nI\u2019ve been trying to get these damn earrings out for months, and yet and still, I\u2019m still walking around with my starter earrings. I\u2019d be lying if I said I didn\u2019t feel slightly embarrassed by this. Even when I go into tattoo parlors and ask, I always do it in hushed tones hoping to evade judgment. Why? Because I am a 38-year-old man who has earrings in his ears that he cannot remove because I decided at 38 years old to get my ears pierced.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know that one day I\u2019ll get the earrings out and this whole escapade will feel stupid and small.

The president claimed last year that the Obama administration improperly wiretapped members of his presidential campaign and transition team, though the White House has not provided any evidence to support that claim.

Bannon was asked specific questions that had been negotiated between the White House and the House\u2019s lead counsel.\n\nBannon had been subpoenaed by the committee on Jan. 16 but managed to postpone the subpoena deadline three times as the White House and House lawyers negotiated which questions he could answer without the White House invoking executive privilege to prevent him from testifying.\n\nDemocrat Rep. Adam Schiff of California, ranking member of the committee, told reporters: \u201cThe only questions he would answer were questions that had been scripted, literally scripted for him by the White House. Whenever we sought to probe anything beyond the four corners of the specific wording of the question, he refused to answer. That\u2019s not how executive privilege works.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, lawmakers said that continued noncooperation on Bannon\u2019s part could result in the committee taking steps to hold him in contempt of Congress.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe claims of executive privilege will be looked into by committee member Rep.

Rick Snyder to address public health concerns related to the lead-contaminated water crisis has canceled its fourth consecutive meeting because it doesn\u2019t believe there is anything to discuss.\n\nMLive-Flint Journal reports that members of the Flint Water Interagency Coordinating Committee were sent an email notice that said the Nov. 17 meeting \u201chas been canceled due to no agenda items being received from FWICC members as of [Monday, Nov. 13].\u201d\n\nThat email was sent Monday by Stacie Clayton, who works in the Michigan Office of Urban and Metropolitan Initiatives. The director of that office, Harvey Hollins, is also the chairman of the FWICC.\n\nThe September meeting of the committee was canceled because of scheduling conflicts, according to the governor\u2019s office, and the committee\u2019s business was supposed to be carried over to the next meeting. The October meeting was subsequently canceled, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to MLive-Flint Journal, the committee has only met twice since March.\n\nIn the meantime, a permanent water solution for the people of Flint continues to be in limbo as the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality and the Flint City Council battle it out in federal court over whether or not the city should be forced to sign a 30-year contract to buy water from the Great Lakes Water Authority out of Detroit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn June the City Council agreed to a short-term contract with GLWA as it worked to find a permanent solution to the city\u2019s water-supply problems.\n\nWhen the city failed to select a permanent solution by the June 26 deadline set by the state, the state filed a federal lawsuit against the city\u2014alleging that it was endangering public health by not selecting a permanent water source.\n\nThat makes it more than a little ironic that the committee that should be meeting to discuss public health concerns related to the water crisis has not met four months in a row.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast month the Flint City Council asked U.S. District Judge David Lawson for more time to study the city\u2019s long-term water-source options, but Lawson denied that request on Oct. 27. His ruling indicated that if the city does not act, the state will need to go back to court to file a motion that would get the court to enforce an earlier Oct. 23 deadline.\n\nIn a court filing earlier in October, the DEQ asked the judge to allow Flint Mayor Karen Weaver\u2014who is in support of the GLWA contract\u2014to sign the contract without regard to the council.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo yes.

Not only would clarification as to their status be helpful, but it would also seem like the right thing to do given that this administration drew a hard line in the sand over immigration and then built a wall around the line and didn\u2019t get Mexico to pay for it.\n\nAccording to the New York Daily News, while speculation surrounds the president\u2019s in-laws, he continues to ramp up his war on immigrants:\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement announced just this week that they made 40% more arrests in general within President Trump\u2019s first year compared to 2016.

White actors get all the fun and we get all the supporting (and usually dying) sidekicks.\n\n\n\nWill Smith has been serving us all those movies we crave for years. He took a chance early in his career (that I doubt he\u2019ll ever take again) with the critically acclaimed Six Degrees of Separation, and he\u2019s been serving us romantic lead (Hitch), action superstar (Bad Boys), sci-fi hero (Independence Day), and serious and thoughtful drama protagonist (The Pursuit of Happyness) since then. He\u2019s forced hard-core fanboys (read: white) to embrace a black man in the role of main character (I Am Legend and I, Robot) in stories where the source material specified a white protagonist.\n\n\n\nBut with his most recent outing in Netflix\u2019s Bright, Smith may have missed an opportunity to usher in a larger Afrofuturist revolution in pop culture. Afrofuturism, a word coined by Mark Dery in the early \u201990s, is a scientific and historical philosophy that creates and embraces a cultural aesthetic that combines historical fiction, science fiction, fantasy, Afrocentrism and magical realism to critique the present lives of black folk, examines the lives of black folk in the past and reimagines black folk in the future. Basically, it\u2019s a way for black folk to get free. So far, Smith hasn\u2019t given us that specific vision.\n\nI don\u2019t know if Smith knows what Afrofuturism is or that he\u2019s even trying to make these types of movies, but he has been sending us signals with his role choices that imply he could be open to it. He tried, though. Y\u2019all remember After Earth? The idea of a black super soldier taking his son on a futuristic journey of self-discovery is the type of Afrofuturist movie that could be an allegory for the relationship between black men and their sons. But from the direction to the screenplay, it didn\u2019t work out, and he even said in an interview with Variety that that particular \u201cfailure\u201d shook him. But with his star power and mind for science fiction narratives, he could really be telling these stories. He seems to have a mind for stories that are different, and maybe a little weird. And that\u2019s what leads me to Bright.\n\nBright has more than a few problems. The plot is like any of your fave buddy-cop movies; it has echoes of Training Day, Bad Boys, Colors and even a little Lethal Weapon. It also reminded me and my partner of the unfortunately short-lived television show Alien Nation, which paired a human cop with an alien.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn my opinion, on its face, Bright is not a bad movie, even if it is written by a problematic figure like Max Landis. Clearly, Landis knows his buddy-cop movies from the familiar tropes he uses in Bright. But he\u2019s not a futurist and definitely has no vision for who, where and how black folk will be in the future. And that\u2019s sort of the point here.\n\n\n\nFor Smith to succeed at making Afrofuturist movies, he needs to start working with some black writers and directors who understand the concepts to get this Afrofuturist revolution off the ground. For example, there is no way that he should have said, \u201cFairy lives don\u2019t matter.\u201d It\u2019s cheap and mocks the Black Lives Matter movement. He\u2019s Will Smith; doesn\u2019t he have enough Hollywood social capital to have nixed that line?\n\nWithout some real deep world building (which this movie had little of), the audience is left to wonder how it is that Orcs are to be read as the \u201cniggas\u201d in the film versus Smith as the \u201cupstanding black guy.\u201d Even though the Elf detective Kandomere is portrayed by Venezuelan actor Edgar Ramirez, all the Elves are supposed to be read as white 1 percenters. Even the \u201cactual\u201d white folks in this alternative present still wallow in entitled whiteness. Your favorite rapper wasn\u2019t excited about this attempt at a racial allegory, either. This is regressive racial misunderstanding at its worst and a pandering to our sentimental relationship to iconic buddy-cop movies (both the good and the bad).\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Smith to succeed at making Afrofuturist movies, he needs to start working with some black writers and directors who understand the concepts to get this Afrofuturist revolution off the ground.\n\nI know that Smith didn\u2019t write this movie; nor did he direct it. But when he read the script, why he didn\u2019t say, \u201cHmmm ... there\u2019s some problems here\u201d? The metaphors about race and racism land flat, and I\u2019m no prude when it comes to dystopia, but if we\u2019re going to go there, let\u2019s do it full force. The best semirecent mainstream example of a dystopian landscape involving a racial allegory has got to be District 9, set in South Africa. In it, the racial implications of what it means to be \u201cother\u201d are not shied away from.\n\n\n\nAfrofuturism is not for the faint of heart. It can help us discuss racism and its impact on the contemporary and future black body and give us language to talk about the kind of racial schadenfreude that can exist between those who have historically been on the bottom of the racial scale and those who are on the bottom now. Consider the shift of hatred from blacks to Middle Eastern Muslims after 9/11, or think about mass shootings and how we black folk cross our collective fingers, hoping that the individual wielding the gun ain\u2019t \u201cone of us.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe exploration of race in Bright is lacking because there was no one who had a competent racial lens. In the midst of watching the movie, I wondered, where was Smith\u2019s voice in all of this? He clearly likes sci-fi. He clearly wants to create new and exciting work. Even in his commercial failures, like After Earth (which I hated) and Hancock (which I actually loved\u2014don\u2019t judge me), he wants to be a part of projects that show black people in different spaces and times and worlds.\n\n\n\nReleasing Bright in a Black Panther moment is like, \u201cBruh, you\u2019re giving us this?\u201d The reason black people are planning to keep Marvel\u2019s Black Panther in the theaters for at least six months when it drops in February is that it\u2019s a movie that confidently boasts a black director, black actors and a black screenwriter who seem to grasp the concepts of Afrofuturism even if that wasn\u2019t their intent.\n\n\n\nAfrofuturism is ripe for a revolution. I am not exaggerating when I say that black folks\u2019 survival in the United States is an Afrofuturist story in itself. I just want Smith to recognize that he\u2019s started the work of bringing this revolution to the mainstream, and because of that, I want him to move forward with black writers, directors and actors who employ an Afrofuturist lens. He\u2019s Will Smith; he\u2019s got a long and successful track record in Hollywood. And we were expecting more.

It appears that is what Mueller and his team want to know.\n\nSources have told CNN that it is unclear whether Mueller has concrete evidence that Trump engaged in any wrongdoing, but the special counsel is leaving no stone unturned.\n\nInvestigators are reportedly particularly interested in when Trump actually decided to run for president. They are also looking into allegations presented in a controversial dossier and whether the Russians have information that matches that included in the dossier\u2014information they may be holding over the president\u2019s head.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are also questions related to the 2013 Miss Universe pageant, which was held in Moscow.

When it was revealed that both the FBI and White House officials knew about the allegations against both men, it raised questions as to why they were allowed to keep their jobs and whether or not this administration enables abusers.\n\nIn a White House press briefing Monday afternoon, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders asserted that the White House takes the allegations \u201cvery seriously\u201d and believes that they should be \u201cinvestigated thoroughly.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe president and the entire administration take domestic violence very seriously and believe all allegations need to be investigated thoroughly. Above all, the president supports victims of domestic violence and believes everyone should be treated fairly and with due process. We\u2019ve addressed this situation extensively, and we have nothing more to add at this time on that topic,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nWhen asked why we haven\u2019t heard the president himself say that he supports victims, Sanders said, \u201cI spoke with the president. Those are actually directly his words that he gave me.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen pressed on the issue as to why Donald Trump hasn\u2019t said that when he\u2019s had the opportunity to do so, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s my job to speak on behalf of the president. I spoke to him, and he relayed that message directly to me, and I\u2019m relaying it directly to you.\u201d\n\nOh, really?\n\nI seem to recall last summer, when asked why the president was allowed to tweet things about special counsel Robert Mueller, Sanders specifically said that it was not her job to speak for the president.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, is it \u201cOochie Wally\u201d or is it \u201cOne Mic,\u201d Suckabee?\n\nFurthermore, it\u2019s interesting that this is the spin we are being given considering that the president has tweeted on his own about the situation, and what he said is the complete antithesis of what Sanders is saying to the American people now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Saturday, the president wrote on Twitter: \u201cPeoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation. Some are true and some are false. Some are old and some are new. There is no recovery for someone falsely accused\u2014life and career are gone. Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process?\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t sound like a man who supports victims of domestic violence. That sounds like a man who wants to gaslight victims in favor of the men accused.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen asked about the Rob Porter situation Friday, Trump defended Porter publicly and said, \u201cHe says he innocent, and I think you have to remember that.\u201d\n\nThat is the same defense he lobbed for then-Senate candidate Roy Moore back in December when allegations of inappropriate sexual contact with minors emerged about Moore.\n\nAt the time, Trump said, \u201cWell, he denies it. He says it didn\u2019t happen. And you have to listen to him also.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFurthermore, the president himself has been accused 19 times of sexual harassment and sexual abuse\u2014claims that he and the White House have labeled \u201cfake news.\u201d His administration\u2019s policies do not show any amount of care for women who are victims, either. In fact, before he even took office, his team proposed eliminating the Justice Department\u2019s violence-against-women grant programs that allocate funds to organizations that deal with sexual assault and domestic abuse.\n\nAs a woman, I\u2019m not sure how Suckabee reconciles her staunch defense of the president and his bullshit in the wake of the #MeToo movement. That she could stand at that podium and give that bullshit-ass statement is sickening. She knows what her boss has said publicly (more than once!) when it comes to accused abusers, and she continues to defend him anyway. It\u2019s gross.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s obvious the president doesn\u2019t care about victims of domestic violence. He\u2019s made that clear.\n\nThe somewhat shocking reveal here is that maybe Suckabee doesn\u2019t care, either.\n\nAnd that\u2019s sad.", "keywords": ["huckabee", "say", "sexual", "sarah", "statements", "violence", "victims", "allegations", "trump", "supports", "white", "sanders", "house", "tweets", "president", "domestic"], "polarity": 0.035624403844742844, "subjectivity": 0.4193398879839558},

That special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into the president\u2019s collusion with Russia must be heating up.

All four men have pleaded guilty to various charges.\n\nMueller has also charged Russian lawyer Alex van der Zwaan, who reportedly lied to federal investigators in the Russia probe in federal court on Feb. 16. He also pleaded guilty. Then there is Richard Pinedo, a California man who used stolen identities to sell bank accounts to Russians meddling in the election. Pinedo pleaded guilty, too. And let\u2019s not forget the 13 Russian nationals and three Russian companies that were indicted in February for allegedly interfering in the 2016 election.

Trump doesn\u2019t like when people mess with \u201cHopester,\u201d as he affectionately calls her. Clearly, Trump is worried that all of the Russian walls are closing in around him.

Barack Obama\n\nHe\u2019s on the list because I believe Obama would actually run into a school to save children, but he\u2019s last. Why? Because nobody wants to see Obama in danger.

Bush\n\nScreenshot: 20th Century Fox\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou know George H.W. Bush used to run the CIA, right? You\u2019re never not running the CIA. The guy almost snuffed out Homer Simpson.

Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho\n\nThe president in Idiocracy would totally save a bunch of kids from a deranged shooter. He\u2019s a former porn actor-turned-wrestler-turned president who shoots flame throwers during the State of the Union. He is everything Donald Trump would want to be, except for the black part.

It\u2019s Marshall by a plane length.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Fitzgerald Grant\n\nFitz is a weasel, and I loathe him more than I loathe Scandal in general. Fitz would claim he was going to save the kids, and then, at the last minute, Papa Pope would pull off some diabolical plan to actually get it done, blackmailing Fitz in the process, but Fitz would still take credit and have Oval Office sex with Olivia to celebrate. Makes me nauseous just thinking about it. I\u2019d be just as happy if he saved the kids and didn\u2019t make it.\n\n1. Teddy Roosevelt\n\nTruth is, Teddy Roosevelt was the original Ruff Ryder.

And it\u2019ll continue long after the ongoing crisis ends.\n\nThat\u2019s the premise of the new Netflix docuseries Flint Town coming out Friday. The eight-episode show has little to do with the water crisis that left the predominantly black city of nearly 100,000 exposed to lead poisoning\u2014yet, at the same time, it has everything to do with it. And it\u2019s necessary viewing for anyone who considers themselves an environmentalist or ally to the environmental justice movement, in particular.\n\nThe cinematic show follows the actual Flint Police Department, an underfunded public service agency (like most others in the city), from 2015 to 2017. The riveting high-speed ride-alongs\u2014which include calls to murder scenes or drug busts\u2014give the viewer an exclusive look into the world of policing and, more importantly, the humans who make it up.\n\nA handful of the 98 officers who make up the police department\u2014the smallest number of officers to police any city of a comparable size in the United States\u2014afford directors Zackary Canepari, Drea Cooper, and Jessica Dimmock an intimate view of their lives. This story steps away from the one-dimensional view of law enforcement we\u2019ve all become accustomed to seeing in TV dramas and media coverage, offering something real and raw.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo what\u2019s any of this got to do with the environment?\n\nThe docuseries shows\u2014quite incredibly\u2014how an environmental crisis like Flint\u2019s exacerbates already perilous situations in communities home to people of color and low-income families. Things were bad in Flint long before its water wasn\u2019t drinkable: Poverty has overwhelmed the community since 2000 when General Motors closed its car factory. And as Flint Town makes painfully clear, crime is everywhere.\n\nImage: Netflix\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUltimately, this series shows us that environmental crises are never the only issue with which vulnerable communities have to deal. Years and sometimes decades of social ills compound to create the structure that allows these kinds of catastrophes to happen in the first place. The docuseries provides the important context to understand the ripple effects contaminated water had on the city and its residents. Residents no longer trusted anyone, including the police department. After all, city officials knew lead was in the water and failed to do anything for months and months.\n\nOfficers are forced to police under a veil of distrust while grappling with the ways the water crisis has impacted them, too. \u201cThere are a lot of officers living in Flint,\u201d said director Jessica Dimmock to Earther. \u201cAt the end of the day, they come into the station. They can\u2019t drink the water there. They\u2019re surrounded by water bottles. [The water crisis] is never far from their minds.\u201d\n\nWater bottles are always lingering in the background of this Netflix show. \u201cThat was intentional and also unavoidable,\u201d said Dummock. \u201cOnce your eyes become aware of it, you see [bottles] everywhere.\u201d It can be as subtle as a plastic water bottle near the kitchen sink or as clear as the packages and packages of water bottles sitting in the Flint Police Department.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFlint Town not only offers stunning visuals, but it offers a real glimpse of what it\u2019s like to live and serve this community, challenging the stereotypical narrative around environmental justice. The movement was born out of a North Carolina black community fighting for the right to clean roadways. Today, it can mean a lot more.\n\nPhoto: Netflix\n\nSome scholars have been challenging what we define as our \u201cenvironment.\u201d Is it just the air we breathe? Or can it also include the stressful environment in which a person lives when police don\u2019t arrive at an emergency, or when a mother is worried about making the water pick-up deadline after working a 12-hour shift?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAll those environmental factors contribute and play off of one another,\u201d said director Drea Cooper to Earther. \u201cYou definitely see some of that through the series.\u201d\n\nSo though this show isn\u2019t about the Flint water crisis, I urge you to watch it.

According to data released by the mayor, the city has replaced nearly 5,500 lines so far.\n\nBut plaintiffs in the January 2016 lawsuit that led to the settlement say that the city and its administrator are falling short of their obligations, and they filed a motion in the U.S. District Court for Michigan\u2019s Eastern District on Wednesday claiming \u201cplaintiffs cannot know whether the city is administering the agreement\u2019s pipe-replacement program in a comprehensive and health-protective way.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe plaintiffs say that the city\u2019s status reports \u201chave been late, incomplete, inaccurate or a combination thereof.\u201d\n\nOne of the allegations is that the city has not verified whether or not new filters have been installed in homes after service lines have been replaced, which is a part of the settlement. If new filters have not been installed, it exposes the residents to lead spikes that happen after pipes have been replaced.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe city is also accused of not proving that it is keeping track of homes that have declined service-line replacement from the city. Organizations need that information so that they can reach out to homeowners and encourage them to replace their pipes in order to minimize the health risk to the city\u2019s water system.\n\nIn addition, the city is accused of being slow to report new customers who join the city\u2019s water system. This prevents an outreach organization from contacting those customers to install water filters and educate them on how to protect themselves from lead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn their motion, the plaintiffs asked, \u201cIf the city cannot collect critical, easily identifiable data and provide it within the agreed-upon timeframes, how can plaintiffs trust that the city is competent to execute the much larger and urgent task of service-line replacement in Flint?\u201d\n\nRead more at NPR.", "keywords": ["filters", "terms", "pipes", "days", "lead", "crisis", "plaintiffs", "water", "lines", "violating", "replaced", "city", "citys", "replace", "reports", "settlement", "flint"], "polarity": 0.08173400673400673, "subjectivity": 0.47262367262367255},

I have parachuted in to report at just about every single right-wing, alt-conservative confab you can think of over the last few years. Red State, the NRA convention and GOP conventions. If the Fox News, \u201cMake America great again\u201d crowd is there, I find a way to slip in. However, the Conservative Political Action Conference was different. CPAC is where the rightest of the right meet up to booze and party like it\u2019s 1965 (sans the segregated bathrooms\u2014I think). Stories about CPAC\u2019s legendary debauchery literally brought down an entire magazine in the \u201990s.\n\nI was there because, according to The Root Editor-in- Chief Danielle Belton, \u201cI told you not to go!\u201d which in my mind means, \u201cYou should totally go to a convention filled with people who slavishly follow an explicitly anti-black white nationalist president.\u201d So there I was at the Gaylord Resort and Convention Center off Washington, D.C.\u2019s harbor on a murky, overcast Friday. The crowd was about as white and moody as the weather that day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re Jason Johnson, right?\u201d a 30-something black woman asked as she let me know that I was CPAC-famous. \u201cI gotta talk to you! There was video of you onstage\u2014it was part of Trump\u2019s introduction with Matt Schlapp!\u201d\n\nI was used as part of an introduction for Donald Trump?\n\nLook, this isn\u2019t my first run-in with President Putin Puppet; back in 2016, I was told by several black friends at the Republican National Committee that Trump referenced my \u201cSuicide Squad\u201d column for The Root. I almost gave up writing. It\u2019s like finding out the cute cartoon frog you drew is now the Digi Pet of alt-right social media. Yet this was more disturbing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast year I got into a viral slap fight with CPAC Director Matt Schlapp on MSNBC. I had the audacity to tell Schlapp he didn\u2019t have the authority to say what is and isn\u2019t racist, and he had a borderline \u201cMAGA\u201d meltdown on TV about it. A highly edited version of our exchange was included in a big video montage (at the 1:31:59 mark) for Schlapp\u2019s introduction of Trump\u2019s speech at CPAC on Friday. The crowd went from laughing to cheering to awed silence. It reminded me of the auction scene in Get Out\u2014with thousands of colonizers raising their bingo cards saying, \u201cI\u2019ll take the black guy who shamed Matt Schlapp on national television for $1,000, please!\u201d\n\n\n\nPerhaps I\u2019m being too harsh. The room wasn\u2019t all white conservatives; there was a smattering of Asian and Latino conservatives milling around as well. They were noticeable because the convention halls were half-empty, like a grocery store on the day after Thanksgiving.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been to, like, seven of these,\u201d a colleague of mine said. \u201cThis CPAC is dead.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cLast year was like a party. Nigel Farage was running down the halls taking shots from everybody,\u201d a former College Republican activist said. \u201cThis year, there\u2019s no enthusiasm. Everybody is just tired of winning, I guess.\u201d\n\nThis was my first taste of CPAC logic. Lousy attendance means conservatives are tired of winning? Nobody gets tired of winning. No one has ever said, \u201cDamn. Jackpot again?! I\u2019m going home!\u201d I scoured Google for hours and still can\u2019t find the remix of \u201cAll I do is win, win, win, so now I\u2019m bored.\u201d Maybe I was just looking in the wrong places (maybe Martin Shkreli has it). But the truth is, CPAC attendance is down because only 40 percent of Americans like this president.\n\nI walked down the main radio row lined with right-wing talk shows and ran into an old friend. Well, not really a friend\u2014more like a spirit guide, a totem of the hell that was coming to America: the \u201cBlacks for Trump\u201d guy. I literally didn\u2019t know his name, but I called him the \u201cBlacks for Trump\u201d guy and he responded because we met at a presidential debate in Missouri, when he was the only Blacks for Trump guy, known as \u201cMichael the Black Man.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was before all that other stuff about double-murder indictments and death cults started to sully his image. Before long, we were joined by conservative radio host Kevin Jackson and blogger Wayne Dupree. We talked about what Trump was doing for blacks folks and whether that was even a good question.\n\n\n\nOh, and \u201cnigger.\u201d Did I mention nigger? Nigger was said a lot by these black conservatives, like we were in a \u201990s Quentin Tarantino movie. I guess because they were a bunch of black guys standing in the middle of a conservative convention, they felt real comfortable, but this was a niggerfest the likes of which usually requires copious amounts of alcohol and a highly tense game of spades.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have no idea why black conservatives were so comfortable saying, \u201cNigger this, nigger that\u201d and \u201cI almost had to put that nigger down,\u201d but I\u2019m fairly confident my nigger quota for the entire year has been met, and I will be shipping additional nigger moments to poor children across the nation who don\u2019t have enough nigger in their life, courtesy of America\u2019s CPAC black conservatives. It was exhausting.\n\nThe thing is, I\u2019m old enough to remember 2014, when the GOP\u2019s black outreach team would party at the National Association of Black Journalists convention. Black GOP vets like Michael Steele, Elroy Sailor and J.C. Watts, whether I agreed with them or not, wouldn\u2019t be caught dead using that kind of language in public. CPAC is a mosh pit for the black political fringe, sycophants and opportunists. Further down the hallway I asked Diante Johnson, head of the Black Conservative Federation, a pretty basic question about Trump, and even that went to hell.\n\n\n\n\u201cDonald Trump got 8 percent of the black vote in 2016, higher than the last two Republican presidential candidates,\u201d I asked, \u201cbut since then, his approval has tanked with black voters. Why do you think this happened?\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think Trump is doing great with black voters!\u201d Johnson said, staring up at me with a somewhat odd grin.\n\n\n\nI asked him what he was basing that on, because in every single poll in every single place on various Earths, including an alternate dimension where Omarosa is Donald Trump\u2019s first lady, Trump\u2019s black approval rating is trash.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just not true; you see, polls aren\u2019t real,\u201d he explained. \u201cThat\u2019s just your opinion; they only poll liberal blacks, so \u2026 \u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[BARK.]\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd since your opinion is only as good as mine \u2026 \u201d\n\n\n\n[BARK BARK BARK.]\n\n\n\nI\u2019m sorry\u2014I tuned him out after that. I was staring unamusedly in M\u2019Baku, and if I had vegetarian children to feed him to, I would have, because this man was a shrub. Conservative radio host Melanie Collette jumped into the conversation claiming I was \u201cfake news\u201d and that Trump won 13 percent of the African-American vote (Trump won 13 percent of men, known as the Lenard vote, and Stacey Dash, Diamond and Silk, and post-Kaepernick Sage Steele for about 3 percent of the black women\u2019s vote).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo his credit, Marivious Allen from the Texas College Republicans admitted that Trump\u2019s racial rhetoric is a problem, but that\u2019s it. Black conservatives at CPAC had literally nothing to offer black America. Except, I guess, \u201cnigger.\u201d\n\n\n\nAfter a long day of checking out half-empty booths and sparsely attended panels, I finally left CPAC. Outside of a particularly hostile white woman from the Republican Wing of the Republican Party booth, some strange stares and Niggerfest 2018, I survived the day. Only a few people recognized me from the Schlapp-to-Trump intro, but I flashed my cellphone light in my eyes a few times to make sure I was still me.\n\nCPAC proved to be more bizarre, offensive and disturbing than most other conservative events I\u2019ve attended\u2014and with significantly worse food. The only saving grace is that in the coming years, despite the rise in white nationalism in America, it looks like fewer and fewer people will come to CPAC to express it.", "keywords": ["trumps", "sure", "pretty", "im", "republican", "trump", "political", "nigger", "conservatives", "convention", "white", "watch", "cpac", "video", "conservative", "black", "introduce", "list", "used"], "polarity": 0.027211265103056166, "subjectivity": 0.44043413882966087},

As the writer notes, Leblon is couched in one of the most affluent areas in Brazil and is also a predominantly white space in a country where the majority of the population now identifies as black or mixed race.\n\nThis made the Black Panther screening as much a political act as a celebration.\n\nFrom The Intercept:\n\nOrganizers would start an event on Facebook and call for everyone to meet at a certain mall at a certain time. Young, mostly dark-skinned residents of the city\u2019s poor and working-class neighborhoods on the urban periphery would take a sometimes one- or two-hour train or bus ride to shopping centers in the bougiest enclaves and just go for a walkabout. In some cases, thousands showed up, much to the horror of Brazil\u2019s white elite, whose ever-present racial and class-based fears were palpable. Malls, including Shopping Leblon, closed down in anticipation of these protests. Others were broken up with tear gas and rubber bullets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe rolezinho for the global blockbuster, then, was a way to celebrate blackness in a highly visible way, to reclaim a highly segregated and exclusive space.\n\nReinaldo Junior, an actor who participated in a recent rolezinho, told The Intercept, \u201cWe wanted to occupy this space today to say, \u2018We are alive.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWe almost never see any of our people in this kind of space.

According to data released by the mayor, the city has replaced nearly 5,500 lines so far.\n\nBut plaintiffs in the January 2016 lawsuit that led to the settlement say that the city and its administrator are falling short of their obligations, and they filed a motion in the U.S. District Court for Michigan\u2019s Eastern District on Wednesday claiming \u201cplaintiffs cannot know whether the city is administering the agreement\u2019s pipe-replacement program in a comprehensive and health-protective way.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe plaintiffs say that the city\u2019s status reports \u201chave been late, incomplete, inaccurate or a combination thereof.\u201d\n\nOne of the allegations is that the city has not verified whether or not new filters have been installed in homes after service lines have been replaced, which is a part of the settlement. If new filters have not been installed, it exposes the residents to lead spikes that happen after pipes have been replaced.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe city is also accused of not proving that it is keeping track of homes that have declined service-line replacement from the city. Organizations need that information so that they can reach out to homeowners and encourage them to replace their pipes in order to minimize the health risk to the city\u2019s water system.\n\nIn addition, the city is accused of being slow to report new customers who join the city\u2019s water system. This prevents an outreach organization from contacting those customers to install water filters and educate them on how to protect themselves from lead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn their motion, the plaintiffs asked, \u201cIf the city cannot collect critical, easily identifiable data and provide it within the agreed-upon timeframes, how can plaintiffs trust that the city is competent to execute the much larger and urgent task of service-line replacement in Flint?\u201d\n\nRead more at NPR.", "keywords": ["filters", "terms", "pipes", "days", "lead", "crisis", "plaintiffs", "water", "lines", "violating", "replaced", "city", "citys", "replace", "reports", "settlement", "flint"], "polarity": 0.08173400673400673, "subjectivity": 0.47262367262367255},

It\u2019s something a little more matter of fact. Something that I wasn\u2019t truly aware of until this situation garnered mainstream media attention. Apparently, Colin is not a great football player anymore. Who knew? In 2013, Colin was representing the Nupes well and competing against the Baltimore Ravens in the Super Bowl. In 2016, Colin is representing the Nupes well and competing with J.Cole for the 47th annual Murray\u2019s Pomade Wokest hair award. Now, I\u2019m sure Colin\u2019s play hasn\u2019t been immaculate but there\u2019s no way a man who did this can be one protest away from irrelevancy. But, I don\u2019t blame Colin. I blame the NFL, because it\u2019s trash too, and if it continues on this path, I may have to take a knee.\n\nCam Newton, in the midst of a masterful heel turn against Black America, leads the Carolina Panthers against boring ass Super Bowl Champion Denver Broncos to kick off the 2016 season tonight and I simply can not will myself to care. I say this with a heavy heart, because there was once a time when Madden graced me with a knowledge so intimate of NFL rosters and playbooks that I couldn\u2019t imagine turning away from my golden colt. But I\u2019m stepping outside the warm comfort of devout adherence and settling into a life as an NFL agnostic. The NFL is like eating crawfish. You have to wade through too many discarded bodies, and maybe a little shit to get to the content.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFirst, and foremost, the NFL\u2019s inability to take a stance on violence in the game is ruining the league. But it's also stuck between a rock and a hard place. Football itself is a barbaric game that has made an effort to become safer over the years. But the problem isn\u2019t the actual gameplay violence but the cultural violence, the lionization of the league. Football is a gladiator sport, not an actual gladiator competition. It\u2019s only a game, but the culture around the game is imbued with too many grandiose concepts like nationalism, honor, and humility \u2014 all fabrications invented to mask the scent of CTE and the ATM Jerry Jones keeps tucked behind his fangs \u2014 which are imposed upon the players and fans.\n\nThe league's moralism has leaked into policies which have ultimately hurt its product. There aren\u2019t too many ways you can sanction 22 dudes bashing their heads into each other and you don't come across as a hypocrite. Even with multiple suicides and a bad Nigerian accent bringing attention to concussions, I doubt there will be a Netflix doc on how many people have torn their ACLs by just having a fat guy fall on them. Nevertheless, NBC still has the nerve to trot out kind pinto bean Tony Dungy to pull on our heartstrings. Straddling the fence into faux morality degrades the quality of the game and a fan\u2019s ability to remain interested because, in reality, if the players don\u2019t matter to the league, how can there be morality?\n\nEveryone\u2019s heard of the stat about the average length of an NFL career being short. Especially, running backs. But it\u2019s getting worse. The league is getting younger and younger because no one wants to pay veteran contracts. Plus, even the players know that\u2019s it's just not worth it. In recent years all-time greats like Calvin Johnson, Patrick Willis, and Marshawn \u201cBeast Mode\u201d Lynch retired prematurely. An NFL pension must include Atlantic City weekend Suites at the Tropicana and $500 in free slot play in lieu of dental and vision coverage. If the quality players don\u2019t want to stick around why should I? To enjoy players not break records? And not win Superbowls? In addition to the medical discardure of players, these inane moral clauses are enforced poorly as well, which ultimately hurts the players. Josh Gordon and Le\u2019Veon Bell have been suspended longer than I\u2019ve known either of their names or realized why I should care about them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe media has also alley-ooped the NFL a couple of wadded up tissues to slam into the trash bin. Unlike other major American team sports, the NFL is completely domestic, so there are no foreign leagues to watch, or international competitions, or even amateur competitions like the Drew League to keep your beak wet during the offseason. So we\u2019re forced to neverending media coverage of nothing. When ESPN had a stranglehold on sports fans\u2019 attention through the 2000s it was easier to get actual information through the entertainment because they had you captive like a Virgin America pre flight safety video. Sadly, cable cutting has forced many sports media enterprises into sensationalism but unlike the NBA, NFL offseason drama is nearly entirely about irrelevant basura. Especially basura that pits the player vs the policies of the omniscient and all-powerful shield in some fashion. This \u201centertainment\u201d choice was born when Terrell Owens did sit ups in driveway during his free agent negotiations, but it\u2019s quickly moved away from anything to do with actual player transactions. From Brett Favre\u2019s dick pics, to Tim Tebow, to Brady and Kaepernick. The NFL offseason story is moving further and further away from the game. Unless it can be swept under the rug, like Ray Rice. If it\u2019s any consolation, the NFL did manage to snag a best miniseries Emmy nom alongside the People vs OJ Simpson when the feds finally caught Teflon Tom with the RICO in the series finale of \u201cDeflategate.\u201d\n\nThis accelerated revolving door of players has left me a bit melancholic. The machine is bolder and less concerned about how it\u2019s policies appear. The overall decline in quality has left me with one final option that I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m willing to accept: \"Casual fandom\" aka \"total divestment from actually knowing what you\u2019re talking about\" aka \"being a Cowboys fan.\" Ultimately, the NFL wants casual fans more than Drake wants Rihanna's last name. People who don\u2019t know what slant routes are, and will buy $7 nachos instead of jamming little Debbie cakes in their coat pockets because they have \u201clow blood sugar.\u201d People who will cheer for a team just because they\u2019re red or blue because it\u2019s easier replace a template than genuine craftsmanship. But, I\u2019d rather cheer for a bloodsport than half-hearted moralizing masquerading as the true essence of Americana. Save me some flats at the Super Bowl party.

The GOP has accused him of a conflict of interest in that case because his wife accepted nearly $500,000 in political donations from Clinton ally Terry McAuliffe in a state legislature bid that predated the investigation. The Washington Post reported, in December, McCabe\u2019s intention to retire when he became eligible for pension benefits in early March. Trump, who has been among McCabe\u2019s fiercest critics, characterized the move as \u201cracing the clock to retire with full benefits.\u201d A spokesperson for the FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Trump, as early as July, had called for McCabe\u2019s ouster, demanding, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t A.G. Sessions replace Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, a Comey friend who was in charge of Clinton investigation?\u201d \u201cHow can FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, the man in charge, along with leakin\u2019 James Comey, of the Phony Hillary Clinton investigation (including her 33,000 illegally deleted emails) be given $700,000 for wife\u2019s campaign by Clinton Puppets during investigation?\u201d he tweeted in December.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Washington Post reports that after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, he asked McCabe during a closed-door meeting whom he voted for during the 2016 election.\n\nThe Hill notes that because McCabe is a civil servant, it was almost impossible to fire him unless there was clear evidence that he\u2019d done something wrong.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear why McCabe decided to retire just months from his retirement, or whether scrutiny over his tenure had intensified. According to CNN, there have been conflicting reports as to what actually took place:\n\nVarious sources described McCabe\u2019s departure as a mutual decision, while others said it was the result of pressure to step down. One source briefed on the matter said McCabe announced his decision to senior executives and portrayed it as his choice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne source told the news network that McCabe\u2019s sudden announcement was not in the plans as of Friday. \u201cHe had enough of being undermined and criticized,\u201d another source said. But Trump and the administration were \u201cnot happy\u201d with him, the same source said, CNN reports.\n\nTrump did not respond when questioned about McCabe\u2019s \u201cstepping aside\u201d\u2014which appears to be the company line.\n\n\n\nClearly, this was never going to work.

Would they use that generic African accent overused in Hollywood films? I looked to my left and right and wondered if the folks next to me were wondering the same things.\n\nHow would this superhero action flick \u201cuse\u201d the African characters?\n\nAfrica was not untouched by the Black Panther hype. It blew across over here, too, with the winds stronger in some places, like in South Africa, Kenya, Uganda and Zimbabwe, where people were paying close attention to actors of South and East African descent\u2014John Kani, Lupita Nyong\u2019o, Daniel Kaluuya, Florence Kasumba and Danai Gurira.\n\nMany of us had seen the trailers featuring the stunning wardrobe and the spectacular special effects. We were curious to see this Dora Milaje, the all-female fighter guard assigned to protect the king and royal family. Many of us already knew that the Dora Milaje looked a lot like the Ahosi of Dahomey, aka the Dahomey \u201cAmazons,\u201d an all-female military guard formed in the late 17th century by King Wegbaja from the kingdom of Dahomey, and expanded by his son, King Agaja. We knew about the stellar cast and the mighty $200 million production budget, the most expensive movie directed by a black director with a mostly black cast.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe knew these things, but still, what would the Africans, the black people, the Wakandans, look like? Many of us have grown tired of being sick and tired of how we are presented in Hollywood movies because the depictions often give the impression that Africans are backward. What would Wakanda look like?\n\nUgandan Lydia Namubiru, who saw the film in Kampala, Uganda\u2019s capital, said she went in with low expectations.\n\n\u201cMy first thought was that they are going to patronize us with stereotypes,\u201d she told The Root. \u201cEven going in, I was skeptical.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerhaps it was a combination of measured curiosity and genuine excitement to see what could be something new in Hollywood storytelling about black people that partly drove untold numbers of people across Africa to cinemas over the past few days to catch the premiere.\n\nIn Ethiopia\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, the five daily screenings have been sold out at the sole theater showing the film. At the Accra Mall in Ghana, drummers came in beating out rhythms that heightened the crowd\u2019s enthusiasm. In Lagos, my fellow Nigerians were decked to the nines in gorgeous wax prints and chunky jewelry. In Kampala, attendants graced a cocktail hour before the premiere at the Acacia Mall.\n\nGoing out to the movies this time was like no other. This was a cultural occasion that was memorialized with selfies and social media posts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSenegal-based Kenyan native and writer Ciku Kimeria dressed carefully in a chic, all-black assemble and wrapped her long locks in bantu knots and adorned her neck with a colorful southern-African-inspired choker.\n\n\u201cThere was no way I was going to Wakanda just looking regular. I know black people and this is Senegal. I knew people were going to dress up,\u201d Kimeria told The Root.\n\nI joined friends and posed in front of the Black Panther poster, but I didn\u2019t know what would await me when I watched the film.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo when the lights in the cinema hall dimmed, the silence took over the room and the screen lit up to a wide shot zooming in on massive cone-shaped buildings inspired by Sudano-Sahelian architecture; I knew something was happening. And I held my breath in wonder.\n\n\u201cI almost got up to clap \u2026 the hype is all worth it!\u201d Kimeria said.\n\nShe, too, was floored when she saw the architecture because it reminded her of a mosque building she had seen on a visit to the West African nation of Burkina Faso.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor many Africans, the film brought to the big screen a reality that they see every day\u2014the Basotho blankets the warriors used as a protective shield, the queen\u2019s Zulu hat, the ochre-dyed locks of the Himba, the flowing fabrics of the Wolof. It was the sheer Pan-Africanism of it all that astounded me. The cinematic display of the diversity of Africanness was beautiful.\n\nFor some viewers, the film also represented a hope nurtured in the heart of what Africa could be. Ugandan sports radio journalist Patrick Kanyamozi told The Root that watching the film the night it premiered in Uganda made him feel that he was part of history in the making.\n\n\u201cWhat we can learn from this film is that Africa has always had potential\u2014the gold, the diamonds and everything. It\u2019s only we were not able to work on that in the years that went by, but still, Africans individually can still pursue their dreams,\u201d Kanyamozi said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe were humanized, and that matters,\u201d said 25-year-old Johannesburg-based South African journalist and filmmaker Sumeya Gasa. She said the whole experience was overwhelming and she is still trying to process it. \u201cIt\u2019s feels so good, too good.\u201d\n\nBut that \u201ctoo good\u201d feeling of Wakanda and what it could represent for black people in Africa and the Diaspora is what some people are trying to capture in their everyday lives. R.J. Mahdi is an Atlanta native who moved to Senegal years ago. He says that as an African American, he understood the character of the villainous N\u2019Jadaka, aka Killmonger.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think Killmonger\u2019s character was an accurate depiction of the majority of black Americans feeling in one way or another. It was obviously symbolic, him being displaced from Wakanda. In retrospect, the majority of African Americans do feel that we have been abandoned in the world, and that\u2019s a tough feeling,\u201d Mahdi told The Root.\n\n\u201cWe hear it all the time. African Americans say, \u2018Why didn\u2019t Africans come and fight for us in the civil rights movement or in the years of slavery?\u2019 I think that whenever you can bridge that gap and find a common ground, which was something that can happen, because even in the movie, it took them to find it out and learn each other\u2019s point of view to soften their heart towards each other in the end.\u201d\n\n\n\nEven Lydia Namubiru, the skeptical one, gave a positive review of the movie. She said she appreciated that it touched on the theme of the relationship between African Americans and Africans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe movie represented Africans\u2019 reaction to that radical Pan-Africanism that Killmonger had as just violence and just madness, as something crazy. I do feel like Killmonger being killed without properly understanding him was a pretty accurate depiction of how we react to radical Pan-Africanism,\u201d she told The Root.\n\nShe said she hopes the film will spark deeper conversations among Africans on how to do a better job of understanding black people in the Diaspora, particularly African Americans.\n\nIn the end, many viewers felt that the \u201cAfrican\u201d characters were humanized and nuanced, and there is a belief that this feeling of hope will be sustained and used as inspiration to channel the advancement of Africa. And for someone like me, who grew up being called \u201cAfrican booty scratcher\u201d and watching Africans as stock characters, I couldn\u2019t help shedding a tear at the end of the film, and I know that I was not the only one.", "keywords": ["africans", "characters", "going", "told", "africa", "audiences", "african", "panther", "humanizing", "film", "knew", "black", "wakanda", "movie", "hail"], "polarity": 0.054741522366522376, "subjectivity": 0.42516208791208787},

I was the first child of my African immigrant parents to take ballet and gymnastic classes. I was their first Girl Scout, first overpriced prom experience and first recipient of their Parent Plus college loan. Together, we navigated mainstream America while eating Ghanaian food at home.\n\n\n\nI was confident in my cultural identity, but juxtaposed with my black American peers and white counterparts, whose customs were different from my own, my acquiescence into self-actualization at times was challenged. My coming-of age years were as diverse as a piping-hot pot of jollof rice.\n\nMy quaint family attended Ghanaian traditional baptisms and funerals adorned in kente cloth and other garb normalizing African culture in my New England neighborhood. Mom wrapped her hair in a duku head scarf similar to Ramonda in Black Panther. My cousins and I wore bright Ankara-print fabrics like Okoye, Nakia and Shuri as we served food and drinks at Ghanaian social events. My dad and uncles donned Entumas like Zuri, although they weren\u2019t used as protective shields, as they were for Black Panther\u2019s warriors. Our African attire wasn\u2019t a costume. My parents brought Ghana to small-town America.\n\nThree weeks into the Marvel movie\u2019s debut, filmgoers across the country have been flooding social media with pictures of themselves in African garb. Men, women and children across the Diaspora feel connected to the \u201cAfricanness\u201d of Black Panther, and it\u2019s a beautiful, melanin-filled sight to see.\n\nThe film connects black Americans to a continent that has ben positioned as mysterious, disease-infested and dark to the Western world. Moreover, most African Americans are descendants of the slave trade, whose African heritage, customs and religion were deliberately erased and replaced with a European system created by colonizers. Watching the two worlds marry in Hollywood matrimony is prime black pride.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the spirit of Black Panther and African pride, I\u2019d like my fellow blacks across the country to keep Africa closer to their hearts, like the way my parents kept Ghana close to our souls. How can we further connect to Africa beyond aesthetics? How can we sustain this feeling of Afrocentric bliss, ensuring that it doesn\u2019t become a fad?\n\nI spoke with Linda Heywood, a professor of African-American studies and history at Boston University, and Gina Paige, president and co-founder of African Ancestry, for historical context and action steps that African Americans can take toward living their best Wakanda lives from the inside out.\n\n[Editor\u2019s note: This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.]\n\nThe Root: Is this moment of African Americans connecting to Africa sustainable?\n\nPhoto: Boston University\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLinda Heywood: There always this need for more Africa, from W.E.B. Du Bois to Martin Luther King, and ... then you have the 1957 Ghana independence; that was the first step. In the 1980s and \u201990s, Africa kind of went underground in a certain way because the image we were seeing of Africa [was] so negative. So it\u2019s like this is a reawakening of the connection to Africa. I think that\u2019s excellent, but we need to sustain it.\n\nGina Paige: The entire community has benefited from the impact of Black Panther promoting pride in being of African descent. As more people want to celebrate their Africanness, they naturally want to find their own \u201cWakanda.\u201d We have seen an increased interest in people wanting to know which African country and tribe or ethnic group they share ancestry with.\n\nTR: How does finding your ancestry help with connecting to the continent?\n\nLH: There\u2019s a deep family connection [in finding your DNA]. People need to know they are connected to something. If you think, \u201cOh, I\u2019m the descendant of slaves,\u201d then you think, \u201cOh, I\u2019m not connected to anything,\u201d because slavery was a temporary status that went on far too long.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGP: African Americans want to connect with Africa because our histories were stolen from us through bondage. As a result of the trans-Atlantic slave trade, we lost our names, our languages, the freedom to honor our ancestors, and our families were sold apart. You cannot know who you are if you don\u2019t have any of those things. We don\u2019t know where we are from, and we cannot use genealogy records to find out.

We have to get in those images. Not just for Black History Month. Not just Martin Luther King and Malcolm X. Junior high schoolers need to be brought into Africa in more realistic ways so that we have not just creative stories, but bring in the stories of real people who had to make real decisions and make choices. Rulers, whether they are female or male, have to make choices, and we have those elements for Europe. Let us have more for Africa. Teachers have to be able to put that into the curriculum.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: Where can the average adult start learning about the history of Africa?\n\nLH: Start by reading biographies. Be realistic in how you look at your African past history, your heroes and heroines. For men, there\u2019s Shaka Zulu (South Africa), Mansa Musa (West African Mali empire) and Asantehene (Ghana). For women, there\u2019s Nana Yaa Asantewaa (Ghana), Queen Amina (Nigeria), Queen Njinga (Angola).\n\nGP: Ethnic groups are extremely important to knowing who we are because they are the social factors that dictate culture.

Although studies continue to claim that the lead levels are much lower, residents are still advised to rely on bottled water and water filters as opposed to using water directly from the tap.\n\nAs the people wait for the water in their city to be improved, NPR reports that the city of Flint has come under fire for allegedly violating the terms of a settlement agreement that required the city to provide regular status reports on its progress in replacing lead service lines.\n\nAccording to the settlement, which was reached in March, the city agreed to spend $100 million to replace thousands of water lines in the city within three years. As part of that agreement, 18,000 residential water-service lines were to be examined and replaced if they were made of lead or galvanized steel. According to data released by the mayor, the city has replaced nearly 5,500 lines so far.\n\nBut plaintiffs in the January 2016 lawsuit that led to the settlement say that the city and its administrator are falling short of their obligations, and they filed a motion in the U.S. District Court for Michigan\u2019s Eastern District on Wednesday claiming \u201cplaintiffs cannot know whether the city is administering the agreement\u2019s pipe-replacement program in a comprehensive and health-protective way.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe plaintiffs say that the city\u2019s status reports \u201chave been late, incomplete, inaccurate or a combination thereof.\u201d\n\nOne of the allegations is that the city has not verified whether or not new filters have been installed in homes after service lines have been replaced, which is a part of the settlement. If new filters have not been installed, it exposes the residents to lead spikes that happen after pipes have been replaced.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe city is also accused of not proving that it is keeping track of homes that have declined service-line replacement from the city. Organizations need that information so that they can reach out to homeowners and encourage them to replace their pipes in order to minimize the health risk to the city\u2019s water system.\n\nIn addition, the city is accused of being slow to report new customers who join the city\u2019s water system. This prevents an outreach organization from contacting those customers to install water filters and educate them on how to protect themselves from lead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn their motion, the plaintiffs asked, \u201cIf the city cannot collect critical, easily identifiable data and provide it within the agreed-upon timeframes, how can plaintiffs trust that the city is competent to execute the much larger and urgent task of service-line replacement in Flint?\u201d\n\nRead more at NPR.", "keywords": ["filters", "terms", "pipes", "days", "lead", "crisis", "plaintiffs", "water", "lines", "violating", "replaced", "city", "citys", "replace", "reports", "settlement", "flint"], "polarity": 0.08173400673400673, "subjectivity": 0.47262367262367255},

Hilary\n\nWas Hilary Banks the Black Kelly Bundy? Or was Kelly Bundy the White Hilary Banks? Either way, the preternaturally ditzy (but good hearted) Hilary was necessary primarily so the other characters could react to her ditziness.

Aunt Viv\n\nI realize that, for some, this is a pretty low placement on the list. But as important as Aunt Viv was, if you rewatch the series, she wasn't as vital to the show's zeitgeist as the characters below her were. Which is why the Black intelligentsia hubbub over Daphne Maxwell Reid replacing Janet Hubert after season three always felt unnecessary to me. Aunt Viv was the chopped tomato in the \"Fresh Prince\" guacamole. Sure, you'd miss it if it wasn't there. But it doesn't really matter if they're Cherry tomatoes or Globe.\n\n3. Geoffrey\n\nContinuing the analogy, if Aunt Viv was the tomato in the \"Fresh Prince\" guac, Geoffrey was the garlic. He was basically the show's Greek chorus, peeking his head in each scene to provide sarcastic commentary and wink at the audience. He also probably was the character with the most laughs per line. And, one day, I'm going to write some Fresh Prince fan fiction about a young Geoffrey's stint as a Black Jason Bourne.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Carlton\n\nThe polar opposite of Will, many of the show's plotlines, laughs, and even Very Special Moments pulled from both the juxtaposition of Will's and Carlton's persona and their bond. Also, while Geoffrey maybe induced the most laughs per line, Carlton created the biggest laughs, either from things he did/said or the reaction to things he did/said.\n\n1.

I went to London, Amsterdam ... and I would have kept going, through the overpriced splendor of Scandinavia, or the lush, economically disenfranchised ruins of Athens, but Berlin stopped me in my tracks.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a city best described as charming ... and lawless. Somewhere between watching a green-haired comedian hammer nails up his nose at an underground comedy club at a punk squat, and attending a fetish club, where people in latex underwear debated politics before making out in an indoor swimming pool\u2014I decided that this was the place for me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019ve been here since August.\n\nGermany, and Berlin in particular, has a reputation of being progressive. With free tertiary education available to anyone, a strict recycling program and unimpeachable tenancy rights, it certainly presents as a pretty picture upon first glance. But much like the history behind this troubled, vibrant city, there\u2019s a wall you have to break through first.\n\nThe first thing local (or foreign) Berliners will warn you about is the bureaucracy. The authenticity of German stereotypes varies from person to person, but one thing that requires no exaggeration is this country\u2019s obsession with paperwork.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s wonderful to live in a city with rent control. Less so when it means filing a binder of documents, and a five-minute registration process that requires a three-month advance booking, a series of signatures and the occasional sexual favor. Not speaking from experience, of course, but that\u2019s not to say that I haven\u2019t felt royally screwed whenever I\u2019ve left the Finanzamt (tax office) or B\u00fcrgeramt (registration office).\n\nThere are just some things you accept as part of life in Berlin: being yelled at for crossing the street at a red light, offering to pay for dinner to avoid the awkwardness of watching a German man divide the bill, and having to systematically flash my paperwork to do, well, anything. In return, I get to live in a city where nature is fiercely preserved and radical queer feminists host summer barbecues where white people with dreadlocks are charged twice the admission as people of color.\n\nAnd even though it has a population of 3.7 million, 13.5 percent of whom identify as foreign-born, black people experience Berlin very differently from white people\u2014a reality that became abundantly clear to Jessica Lauren Elizabeth Taylor, an artist from Florida. Initially interested in just a summer visit, Taylor describes her first impression of Berlin as \u201cpure, unadulterated magic.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was Berlin\u2019s radical theater scene that appealed to her artistically and, ultimately, compelled her to stay instead of moving on to Paris as initially planned. That was eight years ago.\n\n\n\n\u201cI was really impressed ... I was in awe,\u201d she says.\n\nShe describes Berlin as ripe for experimental performance art ... but also sorely lacking in discussions on race and intersectionality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome years ago, she attended a prominent ex-pat magazine\u2019s panel discussion about the African experience in Berlin, an event where distinguished Afro-Deutsche panelists were silenced from participating in discussions with which they had direct experience. She says the conversations revolved around that month\u2019s publication, which featured a cover story about how one journalist spent his day with a black drug dealer.\n\n\u201cIt was unreal,\u201d she says.\n\nThat\u2019s why she started Black in Berlin in 2012, a regular salon series that provides people of color a place to discuss the issues important to them ... and the occasional trap-music party.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe says that racism has definitely been the biggest challenge of living in Berlin.\n\n\u201cThe city and the people are still very far behind,\u201d she says. \u201cThe German word for racism, rassismus, wasn\u2019t even put into the German dictionary until 1996. All the words used to discuss racism are in English. It\u2019s a challenge.\u201d\n\nEven though Germany has publicly atoned for the atrocities committed during the Holocaust, a political resistance to combat spiking rates in hate crime, along with continued denial of historical atrocities like the 20th-century genocide in modern-day Namibia, makes it a frustrating experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTaylor is well aware of these double standards. And, after eight years, she reflects pensively on the time she\u2019s spent here and admits that her feelings on the city are conflicted.\n\n\u201cThe spirit of this city is on shaky ground,\u201d she says. Her initial infatuation with Berlin is now mixed with tension, but she finds comfort in the black, queer art community fostered over recent years.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing I love about Berlin is that you can really be free to be yourself here,\u201d she says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMark Ivan Mukiibi Serunjogi, a digital marketing manager, agrees. He grew up in an East African community in Copenhagen and moved to Berlin in January of last year for a role with an e-commerce retailer. Serunjogi says that after living in Brooklyn, N.Y., for a while, he had really low expectations about returning to Europe, and that\u2019s why Berlin has exceeded them.\n\n\u201cAfter going to America, I became aware of so many things still wrong with our [Danish] society.

I was worried about coming back to mostly white Europe,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Serunjogi believes that working in an international business really helped to assuage those fears, allowing him room to explore the city with an open mind and heart, which ultimately led him to the Black in Berlin group. He says that Googling hip-hop parties in Berlin took him to a late-night event where he met a member who told him about the salon discussions.\n\n\u201cHe had me at \u2018black,\u2019\u201d he says.\n\nWith the added support of a community of color, a solid job and a place to live, Serunjogi says he\u2019s made it work for himself here\u2014but not everything is pleasant. \u201cThe worst aspect about living in Berlin is the dating experience,\u201d he says. The city has a reputation of being hopelessly single, and regardless of your sexual orientation, you\u2019re bound to come away with some pretty wild Tinder stories ... like that one time a doctor proposed to me in a WhatsApp message while high on LSD and MDMA (Ecstasy). Classic Berlin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut he agrees with Taylor that the freedom found in this city makes overcoming those challenges worth the effort\u2014though he warns it\u2019s not for everyone. When asked whether he would recommend the city to other black people considering Blaxit, he said it depends on one\u2019s frame of reference.\n\n\u201cGrowing up in Denmark prepared me to live in a mostly white space again in Germany,\u201d says Serunjogi, which is why his expectations were exceeded with the discovery of the local black community.\n\n\u201cLiving in Europe [before] gave me tools to deal with that ... but if you come to Berlin because you\u2019re expecting something better, you\u2019ll be disappointed,\u201d he says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvising that the best way to experience Berlin is to be open (and ready to be called out on cultural differences), Serunjogi says that giving new voices space to be heard is critical to anyone who has previously lived in America, as he has.\n\nThough Taylor admits that openness is one of the many benefits of living in Berlin, her advice is a bit more practical: \u201cLearn German ... and use it as a weapon.\u201d\n\nAs a newly minted local, I can definitely say, \u201cIch stimme zu.\u201d", "keywords": ["living", "taylor", "really", "berlin", "white", "considering", "german", "present", "city", "black", "serunjogi", "experience", "blaxit"], "polarity": 0.09880833077683478, "subjectivity": 0.40610284728394946},

Would they use that generic African accent overused in Hollywood films? I looked to my left and right and wondered if the folks next to me were wondering the same things.\n\nHow would this superhero action flick \u201cuse\u201d the African characters?\n\nAfrica was not untouched by the Black Panther hype. It blew across over here, too, with the winds stronger in some places, like in South Africa, Kenya, Uganda and Zimbabwe, where people were paying close attention to actors of South and East African descent\u2014John Kani, Lupita Nyong\u2019o, Daniel Kaluuya, Florence Kasumba and Danai Gurira.\n\nMany of us had seen the trailers featuring the stunning wardrobe and the spectacular special effects. We were curious to see this Dora Milaje, the all-female fighter guard assigned to protect the king and royal family. Many of us already knew that the Dora Milaje looked a lot like the Ahosi of Dahomey, aka the Dahomey \u201cAmazons,\u201d an all-female military guard formed in the late 17th century by King Wegbaja from the kingdom of Dahomey, and expanded by his son, King Agaja. We knew about the stellar cast and the mighty $200 million production budget, the most expensive movie directed by a black director with a mostly black cast.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe knew these things, but still, what would the Africans, the black people, the Wakandans, look like? Many of us have grown tired of being sick and tired of how we are presented in Hollywood movies because the depictions often give the impression that Africans are backward. What would Wakanda look like?\n\nUgandan Lydia Namubiru, who saw the film in Kampala, Uganda\u2019s capital, said she went in with low expectations.\n\n\u201cMy first thought was that they are going to patronize us with stereotypes,\u201d she told The Root. \u201cEven going in, I was skeptical.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerhaps it was a combination of measured curiosity and genuine excitement to see what could be something new in Hollywood storytelling about black people that partly drove untold numbers of people across Africa to cinemas over the past few days to catch the premiere.\n\nIn Ethiopia\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, the five daily screenings have been sold out at the sole theater showing the film. At the Accra Mall in Ghana, drummers came in beating out rhythms that heightened the crowd\u2019s enthusiasm. In Lagos, my fellow Nigerians were decked to the nines in gorgeous wax prints and chunky jewelry. In Kampala, attendants graced a cocktail hour before the premiere at the Acacia Mall.\n\nGoing out to the movies this time was like no other. This was a cultural occasion that was memorialized with selfies and social media posts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSenegal-based Kenyan native and writer Ciku Kimeria dressed carefully in a chic, all-black assemble and wrapped her long locks in bantu knots and adorned her neck with a colorful southern-African-inspired choker.\n\n\u201cThere was no way I was going to Wakanda just looking regular. I know black people and this is Senegal. I knew people were going to dress up,\u201d Kimeria told The Root.\n\nI joined friends and posed in front of the Black Panther poster, but I didn\u2019t know what would await me when I watched the film.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo when the lights in the cinema hall dimmed, the silence took over the room and the screen lit up to a wide shot zooming in on massive cone-shaped buildings inspired by Sudano-Sahelian architecture; I knew something was happening. And I held my breath in wonder.\n\n\u201cI almost got up to clap \u2026 the hype is all worth it!\u201d Kimeria said.\n\nShe, too, was floored when she saw the architecture because it reminded her of a mosque building she had seen on a visit to the West African nation of Burkina Faso.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor many Africans, the film brought to the big screen a reality that they see every day\u2014the Basotho blankets the warriors used as a protective shield, the queen\u2019s Zulu hat, the ochre-dyed locks of the Himba, the flowing fabrics of the Wolof. It was the sheer Pan-Africanism of it all that astounded me. The cinematic display of the diversity of Africanness was beautiful.\n\nFor some viewers, the film also represented a hope nurtured in the heart of what Africa could be. Ugandan sports radio journalist Patrick Kanyamozi told The Root that watching the film the night it premiered in Uganda made him feel that he was part of history in the making.\n\n\u201cWhat we can learn from this film is that Africa has always had potential\u2014the gold, the diamonds and everything. It\u2019s only we were not able to work on that in the years that went by, but still, Africans individually can still pursue their dreams,\u201d Kanyamozi said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe were humanized, and that matters,\u201d said 25-year-old Johannesburg-based South African journalist and filmmaker Sumeya Gasa. She said the whole experience was overwhelming and she is still trying to process it. \u201cIt\u2019s feels so good, too good.\u201d\n\nBut that \u201ctoo good\u201d feeling of Wakanda and what it could represent for black people in Africa and the Diaspora is what some people are trying to capture in their everyday lives. R.J. Mahdi is an Atlanta native who moved to Senegal years ago. He says that as an African American, he understood the character of the villainous N\u2019Jadaka, aka Killmonger.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think Killmonger\u2019s character was an accurate depiction of the majority of black Americans feeling in one way or another. It was obviously symbolic, him being displaced from Wakanda. In retrospect, the majority of African Americans do feel that we have been abandoned in the world, and that\u2019s a tough feeling,\u201d Mahdi told The Root.\n\n\u201cWe hear it all the time. African Americans say, \u2018Why didn\u2019t Africans come and fight for us in the civil rights movement or in the years of slavery?\u2019 I think that whenever you can bridge that gap and find a common ground, which was something that can happen, because even in the movie, it took them to find it out and learn each other\u2019s point of view to soften their heart towards each other in the end.\u201d\n\n\n\nEven Lydia Namubiru, the skeptical one, gave a positive review of the movie. She said she appreciated that it touched on the theme of the relationship between African Americans and Africans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe movie represented Africans\u2019 reaction to that radical Pan-Africanism that Killmonger had as just violence and just madness, as something crazy. I do feel like Killmonger being killed without properly understanding him was a pretty accurate depiction of how we react to radical Pan-Africanism,\u201d she told The Root.\n\nShe said she hopes the film will spark deeper conversations among Africans on how to do a better job of understanding black people in the Diaspora, particularly African Americans.\n\nIn the end, many viewers felt that the \u201cAfrican\u201d characters were humanized and nuanced, and there is a belief that this feeling of hope will be sustained and used as inspiration to channel the advancement of Africa. And for someone like me, who grew up being called \u201cAfrican booty scratcher\u201d and watching Africans as stock characters, I couldn\u2019t help shedding a tear at the end of the film, and I know that I was not the only one.", "keywords": ["africans", "characters", "going", "told", "africa", "audiences", "african", "panther", "humanizing", "film", "knew", "black", "wakanda", "movie", "hail"], "polarity": 0.054741522366522376, "subjectivity": 0.42516208791208787},

Rodriguez (Getty Images)\n\nWhen writer-director Jordan Peele won his Best Original Screenplay Oscar for 2017\u2019s biggest hit, Get Out, I cheered. When cast members of 2018\u2019s biggest hit so far, Marvel\u2019s Black Panther, walked the red carpet at the 90th Academy Awards, I swooned. And when I looked out at the sea of (mostly) white people attending the Oscars, I wondered, \u201cDid Hollywood learn anything over the past year?\u201d\n\n\n\nOn a budget of less than $5 million, Get Out made $255 million at the U.S. box office last year. Girls Trip, directed by Malcolm D. Lee, made more than $140 million in 2017. Black Panther is on pace to do $1 billion worth of business worldwide, reaching $900 million over this past weekend. Movie-theater owners know what\u2019s up: Films that are more diverse put up numbers. But does Hollywood know that?\n\nIn a show of amazing discipline, no one of note (so far) has written a story lately expressing shock that black movies are having a moment. Because, technically, this \u201cmoment\u201d has been a known thing since the \u201990s (Wesley Snipes\u2019 vehicle Blade made $415 million in 1998). Or at least since Tyler Perry took his chitlin circuit plays and made Madea mainstream with 2005\u2019s Diary of a Mad Black Woman. If a movie is good, or at least steeped in our cultures and traditions, someone will happily plunk down more than $10 to see the flick. And studies show that films with diverse casts make more money.\n\nBut you can know all of this, make all the money, get all the accolades and still have a career that never quite hits the stratosphere after an Academy Award, thanks to good ol\u2019 prejudice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHalle Berry is a bona fide star with an Oscar for her role in Monster\u2019s Ball, and the most interesting thing I\u2019ve seen her in of late is a fitness-themed, quasi \u201cthirst trap\u201d photo on Instagram. Mo\u2019Nique has been pretty vocal about her post-Oscar life. And while Taraji P. Henson was happy to be nominated for an Oscar in 2009, she struggled to get work until Empire came along.\n\nI know how Hollywood works for white people, particularly white men. You get a real hit that makes real money and win some awards, and you get a blank check to do, create, write, produce or direct almost anything you want almost in perpetuity, even when you struggle to make another hit.\n\nFor example, I don\u2019t expect director Ryan Coogler to win an Academy Award for Black Panther next year, but\u2014according to \u201cYou just made almost a billion dollars\u201d rules\u2014I do expect someone to whip out a blank check and tell him to go create.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s how Hollywood is supposed to work. Just as I expect all of Jordan Peele\u2019s film dreams to come true post-Get Out\u2019s success and his Oscar win Sunday night. Just as I expect Ava DuVernay to have a long and storied career post the Oscar-nominated Selma (and her new Disney film, A Wrinkle in Time).\n\nWhat I don\u2019t want to see is some Langston Hughes, \u201cWhat happens to a dream deferred?\u201d mess where everyone\u2019s potential dries up like a raisin in the sun.\n\nIt\u2019s not easy to be successful in film and television. Take it from someone with a failed TV show (or two) under her belt. But in a world where white men can fail upward until they succeed, black men and women who create, and are successful at creating, deserve the same opportunities, funding and support that, say, Zack Snyder or Michael Bay receive, despite the fact that they ruin most things they touch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, successful black creators deserve even more, since they have a proven record of success. But until the best of us are treated as well by Hollywood as the worst of them, Hollywood won\u2019t have learned this lesson: Diversity sells. Black movies and their success aren\u2019t flukes. And talent is talent, and you should reward it. Nurture it.

While I'm sure Pinkett Smith does believe the academy needs to be more diverse, the impetus behind this announcement now is the lack of recognition received by her husband for his performance in Concussion.\n\nWell, does Pinkett Smith have a point? Should he have received a nomination?\n\nHeavens no. Concussion was a lukewarm and tepid movie that received lukewarm and tepid reviews and was received lukewarmly and tepidly by moviegoers. And, as far as Smith's performance, let's just say it's not a good look when your Nigerian accent is roundly mocked by actual Nigerians before the movie is even released.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(I don't even get this jollof rice reference, and it's still hilarious.)\n\nUnfortunately, while Will Smith is an unfathomably talented and successful actor and human being, he's not exactly churning out Oscar-worthy performances. Ironically, if Smith did get nominated this year, it would have only been because he's Black and the Academy placed him there for diversity's sake.\n\nI see. Well, did Hubert say anything else in her rant?\n\nOf course! She also called the Smiths hypocrites, brought up her decades-old beef with Will, and chided them for even caring about the Oscars while more important things are going on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich was no surprise because Hubert has had a vendetta against Will Smith \u2014 and, apparently, the entire Smith family \u2014 ever since she was replaced on \"The Fresh Prince.\" Seriously, if you saw Janet Hubert out somewhere today and asked her about the weather, she'd probably say \"It's cold\u2026but it aint as cold as Will Smith's heart will be when I see him in Hell!\"\n\nHmm. Don't you think Hubert has a bit of a point there, though? Every year, when the nominees for the three major awards \u2014 the Oscars, the Grammys, and the Emmys (the Tonys are the 4th member of the EGOT, but they don't seem to be as stressed over and talked about in the media as the other three) \u2014 are released, we complain about how they neglect to include Black artists. Why do we even care at this point? Why still beg to be included for an honor that has proven, time and time again, to not be inclusive?\n\nWell, there's two ways to answer that, so I'll start with the most obvious answer first. They're valuable. And not valuable in a theoretical sense, but they provide literal monetary value. Having Emmy or Oscar or Grammy nominee or winner attached to your resume can give an artist more name recognition, more creative credibility and freedom, more opportunities, and more leeway to negotiate when receiving those opportunities. It can be the difference between making two million per picture and 10. They also have a retroactive monetary value, because a movie or an album or a show receiving one of these nominations and/or awards has the tendency to drive more people to see/rent/buy it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut also, you can't dismiss the pure psychic value of being recognized by your peers for your work.\n\nSee, that's the part that gets me. I understand the monetary benefit, but that recognition part just feels thirsty to me. A person like Will Smith already has trillions of dollars. Why would he even care about this damn trophy?\n\nBecause it feels good. I know that answer seems incomplete, but there's really no other way to put it. If you are a person who performs any type of creative endeavor \u2014 writing, acting, singing, sculpting, etc \u2014 and you've put in years worth of effort to refine and perfect said craft, it feels good to be acknowledged as one of the best in your field. And yes, money is great. Money is excellent. Money is the shit. But a recognition that your work isn't just popular, but technically, creatively, and historically outstanding, is great too. It's the same reason young football players dream of winning the Heisman, and young basketball players dream of winning an NBA MVP.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis recognition existing also benefits the consumer, the fans, because it drives artists to create transcendent work. I know it's romantic to think of artists, true artists, as people content to work without recognition as long as the work is done well. And maybe that's how you'd feel. But that's a moot point, because that's not you. If you were the type of person who decided to make the creation of art your career, you'd also be the type of person who desired that acknowledgment. Asking why an artist would want an award is like asking why a bear would want salmon.\n\nSo why not create our own awards? Why give awards like the Oscars so much power?\n\nOkay, let's say you and one of you co-workers is up for some award for some project you completed together. And you \u2014 and everyone else \u2014 assumes you're a shoo-in because you did the bulk of the work and crafted the vision and the plan of the project. But then your co-worker wins. You'd be pissed, right?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course.\n\nNow, what if, after hearing about what happened at work, your wife went out to the trophy store and bought you one, with \"You'll always be my worker of the year\" inscribed on it. How would you feel?\n\nGreat, actually.\n\nOf course you would! You'd feel great you have such a thoughtful wife\u2026for like 15 minutes. And then you'd go back to being pissed about work, right?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI guess so. What's your point?\n\nMy point is that, while all recognition matters, some recognition matters a bit more than the rest. The Oscars matter to actors because it's been established, historically, as the pinnacle of success within their industry. Other awards are nice. But an Oscar is the nicest.\n\nAnd, for Black artists, it's not about being accepted by \"White\" people. While the Academy is predominately White, the award itself is a race neutral standard. Well, it's supposed to be at least, and a boycott of them is a reflection of that ideal.", "keywords": ["oscars", "hubert", "point", "recognition", "matter", "work", "explained", "thats", "smith", "artists", "youd", "black", "awards"], "polarity": 0.2503887269193392, "subjectivity": 0.5179867184969226},

And with a personal income tax rate that sometimes reaches 57 percent, the city\u2019s population of 910,000 benefits equally from a strong infrastructure, free tertiary education and an aggressive stance on gender equality, right down to the 480 days of paid parental leave.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have never seen so many dads pushing babies around, without women, in my entire life. They did it in gym clothes, in jeans and in tailored business suits while holding cellphones to their ears. While eating at famed bakery Vete-Katten, I observed family after family divide feeding, burping and diaper-changing duty straight down the middle with military precision.\n\nIt was clear to me in less than a day that Swedes have that whole gender-equality thing down to a science.\n\n\u2026 But ethnic diversity is another thing altogether.\n\nTwenty-seven percent of the city\u2019s population comes from an immigrant or non-Swedish background, and the largest ethnic minorities include people from Finland, Iraq, Iran, Bosnia, Turkey, Croatia and Serbia\u2014with even smaller ethnic populations from a variety of East African countries. But for black people in America, being a minority isn\u2019t anything new. The question is, is Sweden really a great place, or is it just a great place for ethnic Swedes? The true nature of the city\u2019s culture of inclusivity and ethnic diversity is, unsurprisingly, best grasped by speaking to people of color who have made that migration themselves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSwedes make terrible strangers but great friends.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what Patrick Gibson says. The 69-year-old hospitality professional relocated to Stockholm from Barbados to be closer to his son, whose mother is Swedish. \u201cIf they don\u2019t know you, they\u2019ll just keep on walking \u2026 but once you\u2019re introduced and they\u2019re familiar with you, they\u2019re the best people to know,\u201d he adds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2011 he founded the Barbados-Sweden Cultural Association to address what he saw as a cultural void among Barbadian youths living in Sweden who wanted to reconnect with their roots. With his son in mind, Gibson made it a personal quest to examine the country\u2019s racial past, which is why he co-authored the book Svart i Sverige (\u201cBlack in Sweden\u201d).\n\nFascinated by the history of blacks in Sweden, in his book Gibson observes that much like other European countries, Sweden\u2019s past includes a chronicle of colonization, slave trading and the varied historical ways in which black people have contributed to modern Swedish culture, even if it isn\u2019t widespread public knowledge.\n\n\n\nWalking through a shopping center in Rinkeby, I observe the infinitely greater population of black people, women in Islamic dress and the use of non-Swedish languages. Gibson says that like many ethnically diverse neighborhoods, this one has a reputation for being dangerous\u2014though I never got that impression from my time there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSure, sometimes things happen,\u201d he says, \u201cbut sometimes things happen everywhere.\u201d He finds the neighborhood dynamic, family-oriented and stimulating. When asked if he\u2019s happy in his Scandinavian home, he doesn\u2019t hesitate for a moment: \u201cIt really is a great country.\u201d\n\nBut while modernity has certainly been good to Swedish families, the economy and the environment (which Gibson describes as the holy trinity of Swedish values), there are distinct elements of racism that remain tangible components of everyday Swedish life; but it\u2019s Swedish stoicism that prevents Afro-Swedes from articulating these grievances, suppressing a large part of their lived experiences from coming to light.\n\nThis is why programs like Melanin, a Swedish youth program that looks at the everyday lives of Afro-Swedes, has become so popular and is so important to changing the conversation on diversity and cultural inclusivity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere is a feeling of racism here, but nobody wants to talk about it because they want to be politically correct,\u201d says Azaa Ahmed Ali, 28, Melanin\u2019s program editor and diversity coordinator. \u201cPeople will tiptoe around you, but those microaggressions are constant.\u201d\n\n\n\nAli\u2019s family comes from Sudan, and they migrated to Stockholm when she was a small child. For her, the excitement generated by Melanin is a reflection of what has been missing in Swedish race dialogue, a conversation that she says is much more evolved in the U.S. because people aren\u2019t as concerned with appearing politically correct.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAli says that when she was a teenager, she internalized popular images of Swedish beauty from TV and magazines, which didn\u2019t feature anyone who looked like her\u2014leading her to feel deeply insecure about the color of her skin and the texture of her hair, the constant subject of curiosity from other students.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s considered normal here is the white body, and what\u2019s considered normal here is the white culture,\u201d says Ali.\n\nThis makes sense when placed in context within Sweden\u2019s history. Despite its modern reputation as a liberal darling, it was only 1922 when the country established the National Institute of Racial Biology at Uppsala University, where objectives included experiments that divided people by race and involved genetically modifying the shapes of people\u2019s heads, a program later snatched up by Nazi Germany\u2019s eugenics program \u2026 in search of the perfect white body.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Swedish convention dictates that pointing this out, or any racially charged subjects in general, regardless of how justified, is just a recipe for trouble.\n\n\u201cI definitely get called the angry black woman for bringing stuff up, reacting to comments,\u201d says Ali. It\u2019s a painfully familiar scenario that could take place anywhere in the U.S., but given the unspoken agreement among Swedes to live in overall denial of any racial tension, it should be no surprise that conflicts have been popping up in recent years.\n\nIn 2013 the Husby Riots, sparked by the police shooting of a 69-year-old Portuguese man, shook Stockholm\u2019s idyllic facade and awakened people to a brooding feeling of discontent among migrant and minority communities pushed to the outskirts of the city. It\u2019s there, says Ali, where they feel marginalized, invisible and suspicious of any police presence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt a gorgeous bar in Gamla Stan, with a view of the Royal Palace, some locals asked me about my impression of Sweden. I expressed my overall approval and, in turn, inquired about the riots. The question was quickly dismissed with a waved hand, and someone offered to buy me a beer instead. Up until then, I had been having a great time talking to strangers, eating semla and deciphering their incomprehensible language.\n\nBut it instantly reminded me of Azaa\u2019s final words: \u201cHey, the way America\u2019s going right now \u2026 I\u2019d say definitely come to Sweden \u2026 but be prepared to play by the rules.\u201d", "keywords": ["swedish", "sweden", "blaxit", "question", "considering", "ethnic", "present", "gibson", "black", "program", "stockholm", "great", "diversity"], "polarity": 0.1584084648134235, "subjectivity": 0.4473367082871216},

Although studies continue to claim that the lead levels are much lower, residents are still advised to rely on bottled water and water filters as opposed to using water directly from the tap.\n\nAs the people wait for the water in their city to be improved, NPR reports that the city of Flint has come under fire for allegedly violating the terms of a settlement agreement that required the city to provide regular status reports on its progress in replacing lead service lines.\n\nAccording to the settlement, which was reached in March, the city agreed to spend $100 million to replace thousands of water lines in the city within three years. As part of that agreement, 18,000 residential water-service lines were to be examined and replaced if they were made of lead or galvanized steel. According to data released by the mayor, the city has replaced nearly 5,500 lines so far.\n\nBut plaintiffs in the January 2016 lawsuit that led to the settlement say that the city and its administrator are falling short of their obligations, and they filed a motion in the U.S. District Court for Michigan\u2019s Eastern District on Wednesday claiming \u201cplaintiffs cannot know whether the city is administering the agreement\u2019s pipe-replacement program in a comprehensive and health-protective way.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe plaintiffs say that the city\u2019s status reports \u201chave been late, incomplete, inaccurate or a combination thereof.\u201d\n\nOne of the allegations is that the city has not verified whether or not new filters have been installed in homes after service lines have been replaced, which is a part of the settlement. If new filters have not been installed, it exposes the residents to lead spikes that happen after pipes have been replaced.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe city is also accused of not proving that it is keeping track of homes that have declined service-line replacement from the city. Organizations need that information so that they can reach out to homeowners and encourage them to replace their pipes in order to minimize the health risk to the city\u2019s water system.\n\nIn addition, the city is accused of being slow to report new customers who join the city\u2019s water system.

Infrastructure changes as the city\u2019s pipes are replaced have resulted in residents being forced to continue to rely on bottled water or water filters for a semblance of clean water. The city has also been without a permanent source of clean water to rely upon once the pipes are replaced, but a judge\u2019s order may see that problem solved as early as Tuesday night.\n\nU.S. District Judge David Lawson ordered representatives from the city of Flint, the City Council, the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, the Genesee County Drain Commissioner, the Great Lakes Water Authority and the Karegnondi Water Authority into mediation for hours Monday, according to MLive-Flint Journal. The judge also stipulated that the Flint City Council would have until Tuesday night to vote on an amended 30-year water contract with Great Lakes Water Authority.\n\nThat vote will take place at 7 p.m. Tuesday in the City Council chambers and will include amendments to the contract put forth by the city.\n\nCouncil President Herbert Winfrey said, \u201cI still don\u2019t think it\u2019s the best, but there are now some deal sweeteners in there that will certainly benefit the citizens of Flint.\u201d\n\nWinfrey added that he believed Judge Lawson had been \u201cmore than patient\u201d with the City Council. The \u201cdeal sweeteners\u201d that Winfrey referred to were introduced earlier Monday at a City Council meeting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe new version of the 30-year agreement that the council will vote on includes a promise from Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder to appoint a qualified Flint representative to the six-member Great Lakes Water Authority board that is responsible for determining water rates.\n\nThe contract also asks that the city be granted $750,000 for estimated water bill relief and that the $100 million in relief funds from the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act be immediately released from the state to Flint. The WIIN Act funds are the federal relief funds President Barack Obama authorized when he signed the continuing resolution over a year ago.\n\nIn addition, the state of Michigan has requested that the General Motors Engine Plant return as a user of Flint\u2019s water supply.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Monday the Michigan DEQ had gone to court to ask Lawson to bypass the City Council and allow Flint Mayor Karen Weaver to sign the agreement. Attorneys for the City Council called that move unconstitutional.\n\nThis is all part of a lengthy court battle that began in June when the state of Michigan sued the Flint City Council, alleging that the latter was endangering public health by not signing a water agreement.\n\nWinfrey said that the council had a lengthy series of closed and open meetings to go over the contract with various city, county and state officials. Members also sat down with the mayor for the first time to discuss the deal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHopefully, all of this government infighting can come to an end and the people of Flint can start getting what they need from their government.\n\nRead more at MLive-Flint Journal.", "keywords": ["relief", "judge", "vote", "council", "orders", "water", "federal", "permanent", "michigan", "lawson", "city", "source", "night", "contract", "state", "flint"], "polarity": 0.2563084258736433, "subjectivity": 0.45716795282012673},

Yes, I liked it even more than The Wire, Law & Order: SVU, and Unsolved Mysteries. I loved A Different World, and liked The Cosby Show Family Matters, but I was all about Fresh Prince.\n\nSo when \"news\" broke that the show was going to get a reboot, at first I was like, \"hell yeah!\" Then I was like, \"nawl, bitch I said nawl\" and was happy to find out that Will is Smith is in talks (they're only talks at this point) to create a new show similar in premise only. We've hit this nostalgic point when it comes to our golden era of pop culturism. So much so that a a fake post about Tyler Perry re-making Love Jones nearly broke VSB AND the internet before breaking the internet was a thing. Our servers crashed and yes, as per usual, I think Brick killed a guy. We're so stuck in the glory days of the 90s - and they were glorious - that any grasp for the old while attempting to marry it with new flashes and bangs seems exciting. Hell, I throw a 90s party for this very reason.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExcept, there's Girl Meets World.\n\nHonesty box moment - I had the world's biggest crush on two women growing up: Laura Winslow from Family Matters (who I met in real life once in DC and who invited me to a party she was having but I couldn't make it and was sad about it, we never saw one another again) and Topanga Lawrence from Boy Meets World. Boy Meets World was my shit back in the 90s, a decade full of good shows of all stripes. Danielle Fishell is a bad mamma jamma. Lemonade was a popular drink and it still is, just like Topanga. By the time the show ended in 2000, she was legit bad as fuck. So when I saw that they were rebooting Boy Meets World with Girl Meets World on ABC Family and Disney, I was like, yay, more Topanga, even if I honestly had no real plan to watch the show.\n\nUnfortunately, I did watch the show - and because my daughter loves it, I have continued to do so - and it just ain't got that thing that the original show had. Granted, its on Disney and has been even more family-fied than its predecessor, but sheesh, the corn-ball levels are on fleek. Hell, it makes the corniness of Family Matters - a show that I loved to the nth degree but can acknowledge was saccharine as fuck - seem edgy and violent. This isn't a bad thing, per se; I like that my kid can watch people I grew up watching and learn lessons about friendship and shit. It's just that the idea of another reboot of any sort based purely on the nostalgia of a show that may be better in memory than actuality makes me a little concerned about the end product.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor instance, let's say they actually were trying to reboot the show. I get that it makes financial sense. Will Smith attaching his name to a show that was super popular BEFORE he became one of the highest banking actors in Hollywood could only stand to increase its profile. It's an established name and a show that would still hold cache for its viewers who are now almost 20 years older. I'm guessing most of us would at least check it out, Black, white, or other, if only for nostalgia reasons. So I get the business end. But sometimes the business end of this shit can turn your friends against you, said Dre.\n\nBut from a show standpoint, what would a reboot even look like? Would you cast some rapper - like say a J. Cole or Wale - as a cat from the inner city somewhere sent to live with his new tech rich aunt and uncle in Silicon Valley who hit it big by dropping an app that changed the world? Shenanigans ensue? Maybe its a Black girl this time? Yo no se. Maybe Tiara Thomas? Or Azaelia Banks?\n\nOne thing that I think the Fresh Prince got right, and I largely attribute it to the writers and good execution by the actors, was that they touched on social issues without getting too heavy handed with it. In fact, many shows from the 90s were able to walk that line between after school special and edgy comedy. The \"episode\" where Will became Will Smith was handled well as were the drug episodes and the gun episode and the driving-while-black episode. Saturday morning shows like Saved By The Bell and City Guys were fairly heavy handed (at times), but they weren't prime time television either. I feel like nowadays, it would be a whole different ball game. Can you imagine a show like Fresh Prince attempting to deal with police killings and the Black community, something they'd at least attempt? A Different World attempted to address the riots in LA, and it wasn't a bad attempt but ya know, its hard to take a comedy and turn it THAT serious.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich is part of the trouble for Black sitcoms\u2026they're going to at least attempt to deconstruct and address important social issues of the day because they have to. You remember the flack LL Cool J caught with \"I Need Love\" while Black power had enraptured the hip-hop landscape? Black folks, we love us some us, but i f you DON'T address shit, folks are coming for you, dumb as that may be.\n\nSee Internet.\n\nMany of those 90s shows paid the proper deference to issues affecting the main demographic watching. The Fresh Prince did a pretty good job with that. But I do worry about what that would look like now. Folks give Black-ish all types of shit for no good reason and its as good as any show at looking at the dynamic of making it and trying to \"keep it real\", something that's been done before - see The Hughleys - but not really as well as Black-ish is doing it now and largely affects many of the very people beefing with the show, mostly due to its title. That show catches all the flack.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich reminds me, a few months back I went to a panel discussion about Black representation in the media. It was a standard panel, no real groundbreaking dialogue occurred, but a discussion of Empire (at the time it was on its, like, fourth episode and gaining that serious steam of becoming a social media and ratings bonanaza) versus Black-ish came up, and one of the panelists stated that he felt Empire was more relatable than Black-ish, which to me was the most asinine statement I'd heard in quite some time. And I say asinine shit almost as a rule on a daily basis. I decided to ask how exactly would a show like Empire, full of characters that about 99 percent of people wouldn't actually want to be around, could be more relatable than a show like Black-ish, which was a nuclear family show that seemed very representative of what most of our families either did look like or WOULD look like, ya know, for the bougie Blacks in the room.\n\nHis argument was that Empire's family dynamic was more realistic (!!!) and relatable because of the familial structure and love of the brothers, etc. While that's admirable, and I love Empire, nigga what? Nigga who? The reason I love the show is because its so outrageous, from the top to bottom. Relatable is a stretch. Realistic is unrealistic. Now, I can't knock this brother's opinion, even thought I did here and while I was there at the panel, but I couldn't believe that a show that is basically a newer version of The Cosby Show with way more edge and snark could somehow be less realistic or relatable than Empire, DESPITE the fact that everybody on the panel talked about The Cosby Show as the family television gold standard.\n\nThat was a hell of a tangent to point out how confused I am about the hate for Black-ish, which I realize is a topic from months past in the Black zeitgeist. But a show that does a good job of capturing the Black experience gets shitted on, so I can't imagine what type of leeway a reboot of a show that would now be required to address much of the days issues would receive. And that will still be their struggle seeing as Will is trying to create SOME new show.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut thank God they won't take the Fresh Prince name down with it if it flops. That's the problem with banking on nostalgia\u2026sometimes you ruin the original product.\n\nPoint is, I'm really glad Fresh Prince isn't getting a reboot.\n\nThanks, Obama.", "keywords": ["god", "prince", "good", "belair", "isnt", "love", "thank", "rebooted", "blackish", "shit", "fresh", "family", "black", "world", "relatable"], "polarity": 0.08847890208018218, "subjectivity": 0.5109720266346769},

While billed as an opportunity for victims of the Parkland, Fla., mass school shooting to voice their concerns to the president, it quickly devolved into moving but ultimately worthless tragedy porn that gave President Donald Trump and his puppeteers in the National Rifle Association some wiggle room to never commit to policy changes.\n\nOh, and did I mention that the president literally had to be reminded to \u201clisten\u201d to victims of a horrible tragedy with empathy? Or that his solution involved turning every high school teacher into John Creasy from Man on Fire? Like most things in this administration, the train wreck was so slow and spread out, it was hard to grasp just how bad things were until you got to the end.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo president likes to be confronted with people who may insult him or call his work into question. Ronald Reagan had scripted press conferences; George W. Bush famously wouldn\u2019t meet with Cindy Sheehan, the anti-war protester who lost her son in Iraq; even Barack Obama, who was masterful with hecklers, did a good job of curving the right kind of people at the door if he could. However, if this White House vetted everyone as thoroughly as it did the guests for this listening tour, Jared Kushner wouldn\u2019t have access to the White House cafeteria, let alone top security clearance.\n\nMarjory Stoneman Douglas High School survivor Arianna Klein started the president\u2019s listening tour by telling Trump that he was doing a \u201cgreat job\u201d leading the country. Andrew Pollack, the father of a victim, holding back tears, indirectly praised Trump, too. It wasn\u2019t until the tearful testimony of survivor Samuel Zeif (who actually brought me to tears) that anyone in the president\u2019s presence actually mentioned banning any kind of assault weapon.\n\nThis is not to say that conservatives and Trump supporters don\u2019t have a voice in these tragedies\u2014they obviously do\u2014but the fact that the White House had to make sure nobody challenged Trump, or perhaps asked him how he felt about mass shooter Nikolas Cruz wearing a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat during one of his violent social media posts, was apparent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMedia close-ups of the paper Trump was fidgeting with during the session showed his CliffsNotes, including, \u201cBlame it on Sessions,\u201d \u201cBlame it on the FBI\u201d and \u201cTell them \u2018I hear you.\u2019\u201d Yes, only one of those is true, but to be honest, would any of them surprise you, given that just last week Trump blamed the students themselves for failing to stop the shooter?\n\nWhich brings us to the craziest part of the entire afternoon, the Trump solution to school violence: Turn everybody into Kindergarten Cops. Trump\u2019s big plan from the listening session is to give teachers guns.\n\n\u201cIf you had a teacher with\u2014who was adept at firearms, they could very well end the attack very quickly,\u201d Trump said during the listening session. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be looking at that very strongly.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen, in typical Trump fashion, once he got some backlash for such a ridiculous suggestion, he lied, claiming that he didn\u2019t say what he just said, and then said it again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDebunking Donald Trump\u2019s insane, disorganized and racist tweets is something that I try to avoid, but this suggestion, coming out of that meeting, is literally the dumbest, most impractical response a president has ever had to a school shooting. U.S. public schools are so strapped for cash, they\u2019re holding bake sales to pay for student bus passes and charging kids to play football. It\u2019s highly unlikely that the city, state and federal governments are going to make it rain with millions of dollars to train teachers to use firearms.\n\nNext\u2014and let\u2019s just be honest about the racial context of this\u2014some teacher is going to shoot some student in class or in the hallway or in the cafeteria. The fact is, African-American children are overly penalized and punished in schools, and some white teacher is going to shoot a black kid because he or she felt \u201cthreatened.\u201d Arming teachers is only going to escalate the likelihood of violence in schools, not limit it.\n\nLast, and I speak from personal experience on this, as a faculty member, I love my colleagues, but I don\u2019t want 20 percent of them armed. You want to see a spike in workplace violence? Give a bunch of teachers and professors guns and see how quickly a staff meeting or tenure and promotions process gets violent. Do you really want Ms. Grace from home economics to have quick access to her .45 after Principal Skinner says that her class trip to the Smithsonian is canceled because the football team needs new uniforms? Me neither.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe safest solution to the gun problem is to ban some types of weapons and to keep the president and his brand of violent, aggressive language and behavior as far away from the discussion as possible. No one knows if either of these things will happen, but my CliffsNotes tell me that the chances of any of these thoughts and prayers turning into meaningful policy as long as President Shooting Gallery is on the Twitter every few hours are about as likely as me feeling any safer carrying a .22 into the teachers\u2019 lounge.", "keywords": ["check", "going", "victims", "teachers", "trump", "massshooting", "violent", "teacher", "care", "remember", "white", "notes", "school", "house", "listening", "president"], "polarity": 0.09174624395212627, "subjectivity": 0.5543502249384602},

In India, I\u2019m black. In the black community, I\u2019m dark-skinned. In America, I\u2019m British. Bro!\u201d\n\nKaluuya also explained that black people in the United Kingdom also deal with racism and it\u2019s a universal issue, and there are few stories out there that tell of their own experiences.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re getting singled out for the color of your skin, but not the content of your spirit, and that\u2019s everywhere,\u201d the actor continued. \u201cThat\u2019s my whole life, being seen as \u2018other.\u2019 Not fitting in in Uganda, not Britain, not America. They just highlight whatever feature they want.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI really respect African-American people. I just want to tell black stories,\u201d Kaluuya said. \u201cThis is the frustrating thing, bro\u2014in order to prove that I can play this role, I have to open up about the trauma that I\u2019ve experienced as a black person. I have to show off my struggle so that people accept that I\u2019m black.\n\n\u201cNo matter that every single room I go to I\u2019m usually the darkest person there,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou know what I\u2019m saying? I kind of resent that mentality. I\u2019m just an individual. Just because you\u2019re black, you taken and used to represent something. It mirrors what happens in the film. I resent that I have to prove that I\u2019m black. I don\u2019t know what that is. I\u2019m still processing it.\u201d\n\nJackson later clarified his comments and said that he wasn\u2019t blaming Kaluuya, but the Hollywood system that seemingly shuts out African-American actors in favor of their British counterparts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was not a slam against them, but it was just a comment about how Hollywood works in an interesting sort of way sometimes,\u201d Jackson told the Associated Press.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not afforded that same luxury, but that\u2019s fine; we have plenty of opportunities to work,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cI enjoy their work,\u201d Jackson said of the British actors. \u201cI enjoy working with them when I have the opportunity to do that.\u201d", "keywords": ["daniel", "jacksons", "resent", "comments", "darkskinned", "im", "outs", "america", "thats", "l", "samuel", "jackson", "kaluuya", "black", "british", "africanamerican", "prove", "youre"], "polarity": 0.030371660859465736, "subjectivity": 0.3781939605110337},

After being forced by a federal judge to make a decision on the contract, the Flint City Council last week voted 5-4 to approve the contract, too. Wednesday\u2019s vote by the GLWA board was the final step needed to put the agreement into effect.\n\nWednesday\u2019s contract included amendments made by the Flint City Council that removed language that would have required Flint to pay legal fees if the water authority were sued. Other amendments guarantee Flint a seat and representation on the GLWA board for at least the next four years, $750,000 in estimated water-bill relief for the city of Flint, as well as easier access to the $100 million in federal funds earmarked for replacing the lead service lines in the city.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition, there was a request from Michigan Gov.

Introducing Tethys, the easy to use, fast, accurate, portable and inexpensive device to detect lead in water,\u201d Gitanjali explained during her presentation for the national competition.\n\nAnd her solution was inspired by a real-world problem that she was witnessing some thousand miles away from her home.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been following the Flint water crisis for about two years,\u201d the precocious preteen said. \u201cLead is mostly harmful to younger children, about my age\u2014giving them growth defects and potentially damaging their brain.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, she was talking about the nearly 100,000 residents of the Michigan city that unwittingly consumed and used lead-contaminated water. To this day, Flint still doesn\u2019t have clean water.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not something I want to go through, what the Flint residents went through ... our water quality\u2019s just as important as doctor\u2019s appointments or dentist\u2019s appointments,\u201d Gitanjali said.\n\nNow, with the help of her invention, it would be possible to detect lead in seconds using carbon molecules and a mobile app rather than having to sit down and wait for days for water samples to be sent to a lab.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChildren are literally the future.\n\nAnd one of Gitanjali\u2019s teachers, Simi Basu, sees that as well.\n\n\u201cI am so confident that she will be able to take it to the market if we keep providing her help,\u201d Basu told the news site, calling Gitanjali a \u201crisk taker\u2014she\u2019s not afraid to fail.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for what Gitanjali is cooking up next?

The city has also been without a permanent source of clean water to rely upon once the pipes are replaced, but a judge\u2019s order may see that problem solved as early as Tuesday night.\n\nU.S. District Judge David Lawson ordered representatives from the city of Flint, the City Council, the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, the Genesee County Drain Commissioner, the Great Lakes Water Authority and the Karegnondi Water Authority into mediation for hours Monday, according to MLive-Flint Journal. The judge also stipulated that the Flint City Council would have until Tuesday night to vote on an amended 30-year water contract with Great Lakes Water Authority.\n\nThat vote will take place at 7 p.m. Tuesday in the City Council chambers and will include amendments to the contract put forth by the city.\n\nCouncil President Herbert Winfrey said, \u201cI still don\u2019t think it\u2019s the best, but there are now some deal sweeteners in there that will certainly benefit the citizens of Flint.\u201d\n\nWinfrey added that he believed Judge Lawson had been \u201cmore than patient\u201d with the City Council. The \u201cdeal sweeteners\u201d that Winfrey referred to were introduced earlier Monday at a City Council meeting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe new version of the 30-year agreement that the council will vote on includes a promise from Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder to appoint a qualified Flint representative to the six-member Great Lakes Water Authority board that is responsible for determining water rates.\n\nThe contract also asks that the city be granted $750,000 for estimated water bill relief and that the $100 million in relief funds from the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act be immediately released from the state to Flint. The WIIN Act funds are the federal relief funds President Barack Obama authorized when he signed the continuing resolution over a year ago.\n\nIn addition, the state of Michigan has requested that the General Motors Engine Plant return as a user of Flint\u2019s water supply.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Monday the Michigan DEQ had gone to court to ask Lawson to bypass the City Council and allow Flint Mayor Karen Weaver to sign the agreement. Attorneys for the City Council called that move unconstitutional.\n\nThis is all part of a lengthy court battle that began in June when the state of Michigan sued the Flint City Council, alleging that the latter was endangering public health by not signing a water agreement.\n\nWinfrey said that the council had a lengthy series of closed and open meetings to go over the contract with various city, county and state officials. Members also sat down with the mayor for the first time to discuss the deal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHopefully, all of this government infighting can come to an end and the people of Flint can start getting what they need from their government.\n\nRead more at MLive-Flint Journal.", "keywords": ["relief", "judge", "vote", "council", "orders", "water", "federal", "permanent", "michigan", "lawson", "city", "source", "night", "contract", "state", "flint"], "polarity": 0.2563084258736433, "subjectivity": 0.45716795282012673},

Terrible casting aside (Zach was horribly miscast and AC Slater was just confusing) the movie was at least interesting. It showed some of the beefs that the cast members had - seems that Mario Lopez and Dustin Diamond didn't really fuck with one another - and also showed that Zach had a jones for Lark Voorhies which immediately made him good money in my book.\n\nOf course, they showed the rehearsal footage of the most watched and popular episode of Saved By The Bell, the episode where Jesse was taking the diet pills aka the \"I'm so excited!!!!!!!! I'm so excited!!!!!!!\" episode. It immediately took me back to Will Smith's amazing performance in The Fresh Prince of Bel Air when his daddy ain't want him no more aka the \"how come he don't want me, man?\" episode that left nary a dry eye in any room across America. I'm sure even KKK members watched that and shed a tear for the little boy. Like Antwone Fisher.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFYI. I just watched that scene again and it STILL chokes me up. You go, Will. You go.\n\nWell, because we're greedy, when we get one biopic/BTS style movie we always want more. Here are a few more show biopics I'd love for any other network but Lifetime to take a stab at. Oh, also, no BET either. Mmkay, pumpkin? Thanks.\n\n1. The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\n\nIt's not secret that there were personality conflicts on Fresh Prince. Namely, the first Aunt Viv (Janet Hubert-Whitten) and Will Smith really didn't see eye to eye, which led to her ouster, and the introduction of Lightskint Aunt Viv who, to the surprise of no one, was a total wacksauce replacement. I'd love to see how the show evolved from the eyes of somebody else but it almost seems like they all have a gag order. It's like the first rule of Fresh Prince is that nobody talks about Fresh Prince. Also, RIP James Avery.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Family Matters\n\nY'all remember Judy and Richie? Of course you do. You probably also remember that them niggas cold disappeared from the show without a single explanation. The writers probably sat around a meeting trying to figure out how to explain why they weren't going to be on the show anymore, realized nobody gave a shit, and just moved on to the next order of business. Judy of course went into pr0n and I have no clue what ever happened to Bryton McClure. That's a lie. I just googled him. He's an actor on soap operas and a singer and goes by Bryton James now. Me no know either. I wonder if Jaleel White was knockin' chicks off because of the popularity of Urkel. And there's never a bad time for the story of Cherie Johnson. I'm saying, let's get Richie on the line and let him tell the story.\n\n3. Martin\n\nWe know for a fact that there was drama on that set. Hell, Gina (Tisha Campbell) literally phoned in her entire last season appearances because of the sexual harassment suit that was filed. Point is, I can imagine that show had a lot of hilarious moments but also a lot of drama as well. I'd like to see that. We'd need Carl Anthony Payne's story to make it really entertaining since he was the low man on the totem pole.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Dallas\n\nWho shot JR? Who cares\u2026I used to love this show but I figured with all of those larger than life personalities involved in the 80s that there'd be some juicy juice on the western front.\n\nYou ain't see Dallas coming did you?\n\n5. In The House\n\nYou remember this show with a young Maia Campbell, Debbie Allen, and LL Cool J? Well we all know Maia Campbell has experienced some issues with mental health. I wonder what that set was like with LL being super duper hot shit back then and Maia Campbell burgeoning, etc. I'm just saying, they got ride of Debbie Allen and her errant kid for season 2 and focused solely on LL and Maia Campbell and brought in Carlton Banks. I smell a story. And young Austin would be the one to tell it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat's 5 shows\u2026for what other shows would you love to catch an unauthorized biopic?", "keywords": ["prince", "im", "love", "scenes", "id", "watched", "remember", "campbell", "maia", "episode", "fresh", "unauthorized", "showed", "movies"], "polarity": 0.15669879062736208, "subjectivity": 0.5247102544721592},

Did you go in on all of your favorites when you went home for the holidays, as if mini marshmallows only exist within a 1-mile radius of your parents\u2019 home \u2026 for three days of the year?\n\nDid you try the corn-pudding recipe from the founder of the James Hemings Foundation, Chef Ashbell McElveen, in the first installment of this series? It is a sweet homage to our industrious ancestors who added milk and eggs to Native American simple corn mash. Or, perhaps, did Chef Alexander Smalls\u2019 turkey recipe, inspired by the West African favorite, yassa chicken, whet your whistle? You\u2019ve plenty of time to turn your turkey game on its \u201cpope\u2019s nose\u201d before Christmas!\n\nIf Thanksgiving wasn\u2019t your jam to bring the African Diaspora to the table, let me try, try again. Fortunately, we have a built-in annual seven-day celebration that can assist us to this end. That\u2019s right, I am talking about the somewhat maligned African-American-created celebration of Kwanzaa.\n\nOther than my love of saying the word \u201cKujichagulia\u201d for its rhythmic cadence (which I used when singing the theme song of Welcome Back Kotter before I knew the real lyrics), Kwanzaa seems like the giftless black cousin to Hanukkah, replete with a daily candle-lighting ceremony. However, Kwanzaa\u2019s principles and the celebration of Pan-African foods can be an impactful unifier for all, some of which might already be incorporated into your current Christmas celebration.\n\nFor help with this assignment, I asked food historian Tonya Hopkins, co-founder of the James Hemings Foundation, about gateway Kwanzaa foods and principles and the Pan-African dishes we can bring to our holiday tables. She suggests that Kwanzaa\u2019s principles and the foods accompanying them can serve as a salve for all that transpired in the past year and all that is to come in the New Year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe very word \u2018Kwanzaa,\u2019 derived from a Swahili phrase, means \u2018first fruits of the harvest\u2019 and calls on the indigenous African foodstuffs and those introduced to the Americas from Africa,\u201d she writes in her 2014 Oxford Encyclopedia of Food & Drink in America entry.\n\nFrom an African basket or wooden bowl of fruits and vegetables to the passing of a unity cup filled with libations for the ancestors, Hopkins says, \u201cFood imagery is woven throughout the fabric of the holiday and shows up prominently on the Kwanzaa table.\u201d\n\nWhile there is no set menu, it is customary to serve dishes using native African ingredients like black-eyed peas, yams, leafy greens, rice, chilies, peppers and more. Already sounding familiar, eh? Then hold on to your buttermilk biscuits, because they, along with myriad other breads we love\u2014fish, shellfish and poultry, hearty stews and one-pot dishes, along with fruit-based drinks and desserts\u2014can all be celebrated over the seven days of Kwanzaa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe have enjoyed most if not all of the foods of Kwanzaa on our Christmas tables and beyond, but I wanted to go deeper to uncover some of these Pan-African universal food truths. I headed over to meet my friend and co-owner of LoLo\u2019s Seafood Shack in Harlem, Chef Raymond Zamanta Mohan, to ask him what was prepared during Christmas back in his Caribbean home country of Guyana.\n\nChef Mohan began reminiscing fondly, starting one week before Christmas, when all of the fruit-filled rum cakes were baked and beverages made, including sorrel, mauby and ginger beer:\n\n\n\nChef Raymond Zamanta Mohan\u2019s Ginger Beer\n\n1 pound fresh ginger, grated or processed in a blender\n\n2 gallons water\n\n1 pound brown sugar\n\n5 cloves\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBring all ingredients to simmer and let sit overnight at room temperature. Stir the mixture and serve over ice. Keep refrigerated thereafter.\n\nHe quickly mentions baked chicken, but by the time he rounds the corner to his favorite dish of souse, he says, \u201cMy mouth is watering \u2026 I want some.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is a collagen soup historically made from unwanted animal parts like the feet, head and tail. Much like the beginnings of my Louisiana grandmother\u2019s cold hogshead cheese, souse is cooked for hours until it falls apart and is served hot with fresh lime, onions and chili peppers. His affinity for souse carries over to the Guyanese pepper pot, too, where molasses is added to the cooking process, yielding a sweet and spicy dish that is served with homemade bread.\n\nAnd there it is \u2026 Chef Mohan, like most of us, unknowingly hit all of the Kwanzaa food markers: one-pot dishes, bread, fruit-based drinks and desserts, poultry and so much more. I say keep doing what you do, and now, with your Pan-African family in mind\u2014and, as Tonya Hopkins suggests\u2014meditate on one of the seven principles each day of Kwanzaa to become more mindful and present during the holiday season.\n\nMerry Christmas and happy Kwanzaa to all, and to all \u2026 Kujichagulia!

She has seen the conflicting reports, and she told the Detroit Free Press that she doesn\u2019t trust the state.\n\n\u201cMy concern is, who do you believe?\u201d Thornton-George asked. \u201cAt this point, will we ever trust the state of Michigan?\u201d\n\nAccording to the Free Press, researchers from both studies have admitted that their findings need to be reviewed and replicated by other researchers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarc Edwards is a professor with Virginia Tech University who helped expose the lead contamination in 2015, and he told the Free Press that both studies are valuable.\n\nEdwards said that oftentimes in science, \u201cpeople use different data sets. Different methods, different statistical tests. And I think the study that was done in Kansas had some strengths, had some weaknesses, and people need to repeat it.\u201d\n\nThe study Edwards references was conducted by David Slusky of the University of Kansas and Daniel Grossman of West Virginia University. The study found that after April 2014, fertility rates in Flint dropped by 12 percent and fetal deaths rose by 58 percent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEdwards, who consulted with the state of Michigan on its study, said in an interview: \u201cNo one is saying that lead is not a health threat, that it doesn\u2019t cause adverse pregnancy outcomes. There\u2019s unanimity about that. The only question is whether the observed increases for certain groups in this time period were scientifically significant enough that you can say something very unusual happened here.\u201d\n\nThe analysis done by Michigan Health and Human Services found no significant increase in \u201cadverse birth outcomes\u201d in Flint.\n\nIn a news release, the state said it was collaborating with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to put its study through a peer-review process that will either poke holes in its analysis or corroborate its findings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd there will probably be more studies in the near future, with results that will only add to the already mounting confusion of the residents of Flint.\n\nAnd while all of this is going on, please remember that the residents still don\u2019t have clean drinking water.\n\nWhere are the water protectors and protests for Flint?\n\nRead more at the Detroit Free Press.", "keywords": ["residents", "confused", "unsure", "free", "studies", "press", "study", "conflicting", "michigan", "university", "results", "waterstudy", "state", "trust", "health", "flint"], "polarity": 0.13398233486943165, "subjectivity": 0.5407450076804915},

Having grown up on the outskirts of Washington, D.C., formerly known as Chocolate City, attended an HBCU and worked at two black companies in the past, I\u2019ve been happily surrounded by myriad black people.\n\nRecently, that\u2019s included black Americans who\u2019ve relocated to the Lower 48 from other areas, such as Ghana, Cape Verde, Nigeria and regions in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Given that they have lived here for the majority of their lives, it\u2019s no surprise that we have more in common than not. However, during one enlightening Uber ride steered by an Afghan driver, I was left feeling like an outsider among people with diverse backgrounds, with knowledge of their ancestral traditions, exotic cultures, food and languages\u2014people who knew and embraced their ethnic origins in a way that most U.S.-born African Americans have been denied.\n\nWhile they took advantage of the hourlong ride to play music from their homelands and share tidbits about their regions, I had little to offer to the conversation. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t have a culture, but my usual pride was replaced with something else, and I tried to think of something to share with them about being uniquely African American that wasn\u2019t rooted in slavery.\n\nThe soul food our great-grandmothers made, created out of necessity often with the parts of animals and plants that others discarded. The R&B and jazz, evolved from Negro spirituals, which others appropriate. The braids, Afros and press-and-curl hairstyles that either distinguished us or aided us in assimilating for increased opportunities and acceptance. Though they\u2019re the product of a resilient people whose struggle to survive exceeded their limitations, when it comes to African-American culture, the story often begins with enslavement.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what they teach you in school,\u201d said Mary Elliott, a curator at the National Museum of African American History and Culture, scheduled to open Sept. 24. However, much of what we consider American pop culture or African-American culture has its roots in Africa, she said: \u201cThere are things that we have in plain sight that we don\u2019t even realize they tie back to some of these cultural practices.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen enslaved men and women were brought to America, they brought skills and trades, such as farming and agriculture, with them. \u201cThere are African Americans who that was passed down [to] through their families. We received rations and limited types of food, but we grew our own vegetables. We cooked the okra. We found ways to eat healthy,\u201d she said.\n\nElliott shared the story of an African art scholar who filmed a dance practice popular among Cuba\u2019s people of African descent. He recognized the art form and showed it to people living in Africa, who also recognized it. \u201cThat dance and practice had been carried over and passed down to the generations. The people in Cuba didn\u2019t know they had been doing something that had its origins in Africa,\u201d she said.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s pride in knowing and recognizing that parts of our African culture have beaten the odds and somehow survived centuries to exist in today\u2019s society; however, Elliott said, there\u2019s just as much pride to be felt about those things that were birthed in slavery.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile you might not feel chitlins are something to brag about, she noted, \u201cIf all you had was the scraps, you did what you had to. We found a way to make it work. Those are the things that we need to remember. That\u2019s the stuff to think about.\u201d\n\nNot only did African Americans create a significant culture here, but it\u2019s become so ingrained in the DNA of the country that some don\u2019t recognize how much our ancestors contributed. I neglected to join in the conversation that day and share aspects of African-American culture, in part, because I figured my companions were already aware. Surely, they didn\u2019t need me to tell them about African-American music genres, cuisine or language. They aren\u2019t new to the country.\n\nHowever, when one Jamaican-born American later shared the opinion that black Americans \u201cdon\u2019t have a culture,\u201d I realized that just as I had plenty to learn about their cultures, I could have enlightened someone by sharing aspects of mine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat I believed was common knowledge about how America\u2019s music, food, dance, literature and art have all been heavily influenced by black Americans wasn\u2019t. Our contributions to what\u2019s now considered mainstream culture are sometimes lost and overlooked, not just by \u201cothers,\u201d but also by black Americans, who, according to Elliott, share a lot with those blacks from other regions.\n\n\u201cPeople can say, \u2018I\u2019m from Senegal. I\u2019m from Guyana,\u2019 but we\u2019re all connected to the Diaspora,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s something to say about having a connection to what people call a homeland.\u201d\n\nThough we may have been born on different continents, Elliott said, it\u2019s that bond to Africa that keeps us connected, even on those rare occasions when our differences seem greater than our similarities. So while black Americans from other areas have traditions and cultures that reflect their countries of origin, the centuries-long culture of African Americans isn\u2019t any less significant, relevant or influential.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t discredit the working in the field, the toiling of the land, the raising other people\u2019s family. That laid the groundwork for all of this,\u201d said Elliott, who is proud that her ancestors were able to endure and eventually thrive. \u201cI say my home is this place, the U.S. My family built this place.\u201d", "keywords": ["elliott", "american", "share", "african", "americans", "way", "making", "culture", "dont", "black", "food", "defending", "africanamerican"], "polarity": 0.08058386443803112, "subjectivity": 0.3781881313131313},

The city has also been without a permanent source of clean water to rely upon once the pipes are replaced, but a judge\u2019s order may see that problem solved as early as Tuesday night.\n\nU.S. District Judge David Lawson ordered representatives from the city of Flint, the City Council, the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, the Genesee County Drain Commissioner, the Great Lakes Water Authority and the Karegnondi Water Authority into mediation for hours Monday, according to MLive-Flint Journal. The judge also stipulated that the Flint City Council would have until Tuesday night to vote on an amended 30-year water contract with Great Lakes Water Authority.\n\nThat vote will take place at 7 p.m. Tuesday in the City Council chambers and will include amendments to the contract put forth by the city.\n\nCouncil President Herbert Winfrey said, \u201cI still don\u2019t think it\u2019s the best, but there are now some deal sweeteners in there that will certainly benefit the citizens of Flint.\u201d\n\nWinfrey added that he believed Judge Lawson had been \u201cmore than patient\u201d with the City Council.

She even managed to get the fatal shooting scrubbed from her employment record, as if she had never killed an unarmed man.\n\nShe eventually left the TPD and last fall joined the Sheriff\u2019s Office as an unpaid reserve deputy. A few months ago she came board full time, and Rogers County Sheriff Scott Walton confirmed that she has had no issues on the job.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s doing her job and doing it well,\u201d Walton said. \u201cWhen she came on as a reserve deputy, we talked about when she was ready, maybe returning to patrol. She had some commitments she wanted to fulfill first, but she hit that point a few months ago where she was ready.\u201d\n\nSo glad that Shelby could move on with her life and get right back into the swing of things after killing an unarmed man.\n\nWalton said that he has believed in and supported Shelby through all of this, apparently, adding that the people hurt most by the treatment Shelby received by District Attorney Steve Kunzweiler and Tulsa Police Chief Chuck Jordan were \u201cthe good people in North Tulsa who want aggressive proactive policing done, who want to keep the thugs out.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd to hear Walton tell the story, Shelby has been fully embraced by the community in Rogers County, where he says a few residents have even voiced their agreement with his decision to have her on the force.\n\n\u201cNot to make this a black or white or racial deal, but one gentleman, a black gentleman, approached Betty at QuikTrip and struck up a conversation with her and said, \u2018I know who you are and I appreciate what you do,\u2019\u201d Walton said. \u201cNo reason at all for us not to support her.\u201d\n\nLook, guys, not to bring race into the whole thing, but ol\u2019 Betty has a black supporter.

The October meeting was subsequently canceled, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to MLive-Flint Journal, the committee has only met twice since March.\n\nIn the meantime, a permanent water solution for the people of Flint continues to be in limbo as the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality and the Flint City Council battle it out in federal court over whether or not the city should be forced to sign a 30-year contract to buy water from the Great Lakes Water Authority out of Detroit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn June the City Council agreed to a short-term contract with GLWA as it worked to find a permanent solution to the city\u2019s water-supply problems.\n\nWhen the city failed to select a permanent solution by the June 26 deadline set by the state, the state filed a federal lawsuit against the city\u2014alleging that it was endangering public health by not selecting a permanent water source.\n\nThat makes it more than a little ironic that the committee that should be meeting to discuss public health concerns related to the water crisis has not met four months in a row.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast month the Flint City Council asked U.S. District Judge David Lawson for more time to study the city\u2019s long-term water-source options, but Lawson denied that request on Oct. 27. His ruling indicated that if the city does not act, the state will need to go back to court to file a motion that would get the court to enforce an earlier Oct. 23 deadline.\n\nIn a court filing earlier in October, the DEQ asked the judge to allow Flint Mayor Karen Weaver\u2014who is in support of the GLWA contract\u2014to sign the contract without regard to the council.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo yes.

After being forced by a federal judge to make a decision on the contract, the Flint City Council last week voted 5-4 to approve the contract, too.

Other amendments guarantee Flint a seat and representation on the GLWA board for at least the next four years, $750,000 in estimated water-bill relief for the city of Flint, as well as easier access to the $100 million in federal funds earmarked for replacing the lead service lines in the city.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition, there was a request from Michigan Gov.

The constant conflicting reports have left Flint residents confused and unsure of whom to trust.\n\nAngie Thornton-George, 50, has lived in the same house in Flint for 20 years.

The untreated water from the river was highly corrosive and caused lead to leach into the city\u2019s pipes, leading to contaminated tap water for the residents.\n\nMany government officials of have been charged with crimes in the subsequent fallout, but the city is still without a permanent solution that provides an ongoing source of clean water for the people who live there. When the parties were unable to come to an agreement in June, the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality filed a lawsuit against the city after the City Council refused to approve a long-term water contract with the Great Lakes Water Authority, out of Detroit.

One day, while on duty, Shelby kills an unarmed black man named Terence Crutcher while he is walking away from her with his hands in the air. It is caught on two different cameras.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the second act, our antagonist goes on a news show like ... oh, let\u2019s say 60 Minutes. She damn near admits to the crime.

Specifically, while the fictional world of Wakanda gave us a glimpse at what black civilization might have been like without European colonization, it also represented a world in which the systemic rape that accompanied slavery and colonization\u2014let alone voluntary miscegenation\u2014simply wasn\u2019t a consideration.\n\n\n\nSo it\u2019s a little surprising to learn that at one point, 19-year-old biracial actress Amandla Stenberg was seriously considered for one of the coveted leading roles in the film. While an undeniably talented actress who is no stranger to the genre (Hunger Games, anyone?), Stenberg would never be mistaken for a purely African woman.\n\nBut what\u2019s less surprising is that Stenberg\u2014also a staunch and outspoken young activist who faced racist accusations of miscasting after portraying what many mistakenly presumed to be the blond and blue-eyed character Rue in the first film adaptation of the Hunger Games trilogy\u2014was aware of this as well. At the recent TIFF Next Wave Festival, she recounted the experience in an interview with the Canadian Broadcast Co.:\n\nOne of the most challenging things for me to do was to walk away from Black Panther. I got really, really close and they were like, \u201cDo you want to continue fighting for this?\u2019 And I was like, \u201cThis isn\u2019t right.\u201d These are all dark-skin actors playing Africans and I feel like it would have just been off to see me as a biracial American with a Nigerian accent just pretending that I\u2019m the same color as everyone else in the movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile her admission challenges some of our previous assumptions about how the movie was cast, it\u2019s a moment of self-awareness we rarely see in Hollywood, particularly in the narrow realm of quality roles for black actresses. And while it was no doubt devastating not to participate in one of the most powerful and anticipated black films in history, Stenberg stands by her choice:\n\nThat was really challenging, to make that decision, but I have no regrets. I recognize 100 percent that there are spaces that I should not take up, and when I do take up a space, it\u2019s because I\u2019ve thought really, really critically about it and I\u2019ve consulted people I really trust and it feels right.\n\nFrom her mouth to Zoe Saldana\u2019s ears. It is so refreshing to see an actress less concerned with advancing her own career than with making sure that representation is on point, and we (and, we suspect, Letitia Wright, who brilliantly played Shuri) thank her for her humility and integrity. Colorism is enough of a plague in Hollywood without lighter-skinned actresses co-opting roles that don\u2019t resemble them in the least.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut we deeply appreciate Stenberg\u2019s stance, especially when she is also fully aware of the lack of solid roles available to her. In the interview, she speaks about being forced to take time to choose wisely after her breakthrough role at age 12. But she trusted then\u2014as she clearly does now\u2014that her discernment and patience would lead her exactly where she needs to be:\n\nI still am really young and it\u2019s not a race. I didn\u2019t feel like I had to be working all the time just to prove that I could work. I still have a lot of time. You don\u2019t have to force your career to happen all at once.\n\nYou can read the entire article here, but we\u2019re just going to stand and give a Wakandan salute to Amandla Stenberg for doing the work of self-awareness and true sisterhood. This is how you walk the talk.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(Editor\u2019s note: Since publication of this article, we\u2019ve received further clarification from one one of our intrepid sci-fi loving readers that kind of like Jesus, the character of Rue was described as having \u201cdark brown skin and eyes\u201d and \u201chair like moss\u201d in The Hunger Games novel. So, those in opposition to Stenberg playing the role weren\u2019t even protesting color-blind casting. They were just plain racist.

In that time, they have continued to suffer the aftereffects of an extreme example of environmental racism. The City Council was supposed to decide on a permanent source of water by Monday, but once again, that decision is on hold.\n\nThe City Council asked federal Judge David Lawson, who set Monday\u2019s deadline, to give it more time to decide on a new source of water for the city. According to the Associated Press, Lawson, in turn, asked the state of Michigan to file a reply to the city\u2019s request by Tuesday, effectively extending the deadline for at least one more day.\n\n\n\nThe City Council previously refused to approve a 30-year contract with Great Lakes Water Authority out of Detroit before a June 26 deadline that was imposed by the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality. In response, the state filed a lawsuit against the city of Flint, alleging that the city is endangering public health.\n\nThe city has previously alleged that the state was bullying the council into approving the 30-year deal with GLWA.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough Flint Mayor Karen Weaver supports signing the long-term contract with GLWA, the council said in September that it had not had enough time to determine whether or not the GLWA deal would be less expensive than treating water from the new Karegnondi Water Authority pipeline.\n\n\u201cI thought everyone was concerned about bullying tactics when it comes to our children,\u201d 8th Ward Councilwoman Vicki VanBuren told MLive-Flint Journal in September. \u201cWhen it comes to the state, it\u2019s like they\u2019ve never heard of it.

The accolade includes an unrestricted cash award of $250,000.\n\nHanna-Attisha is being recognized for stepping forward to expose the elevated lead levels in children in the city of Flint, Mich.; for the work she put into establishing a comprehensive care and support system for children and families affected by lead exposure; and for igniting a renewed nationwide conversation about lead exposure and drinking-water safety.\n\nAs part of the honor, the doctor will receive an unrestricted cash award of $250,000.\n\nHanna-Attisha is the director of the pediatric residency program at Hurley Medical Center in Flint and an associate professor at Michigan State University College of Human Medicine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2014, shortly after the city of Flint switched its water supply from Lake Huron to the Flint River, residents in the city began complaining about the pungent brown water flowing from their faucets. Although state officials maintained that the water was safe, Hanna-Attisha was not convinced. She had previously studied findings by leading lead researcher and Virginia Tech civil engineering professor Marc Edwards, which indicated that the untreated water in Flint was 19 times more corrosive than the water that had been previously sourced from Lake Huron.\n\nHanna-Attisha told The Root: \u201cWhen anybody in pediatrics or public health hears the word \u2018lead,\u2019 it\u2019s a call to action. We know the science; we know what lead does. It\u2019s an irreversible neurotoxin. There\u2019s huge environmental injustices already with lead. Our country\u2019s most vulnerable children already have higher rates of lead exposure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cLead poisoning impacts a child\u2019s entire future. Their entire life course trajectory ... it impacts how they think, how they act, their behavior,\u201d she added. \u201cWhen I heard the possibility that there was lead in the water, it was a call to action. It was my professional, moral and ethical responsibility to figure out what was going on in our children.\u201d\n\nHanna-Attisha immediately went to work and analyzed data on 2,000 pediatric patients before and after the switch. Her research found that the percentage of children with elevated levels of lead in their blood had almost doubled since the switch, and in some neighborhoods, it had even tripled.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cContrary to what was happening across our nation\u2014where the percentage of children with elevated lead levels had been decreasing because we got lead out of paint and out of gasoline\u2014every year in the nation, in our state and even in our city, the percentage of children with elevated lead levels was going down,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe did a very simple study and looked to see what was happening to lead levels in Flint. We saw that the kids with elevated actually increased with the water switch, and it directly correlated with where the water lead levels were the worst,\u201d Hanna-Attisha explained. \u201cWhere the water lead levels were the highest, we saw the greatest increase in children\u2019s blood lead levels.\u201d\n\nThat research was done in 2015 at \u201crecord speed,\u201d she said.\n\nBecause Hanna-Attisha knew this was a public health emergency, she decided to go public with her findings. Initially, state government officials tried to discount her research and undermine her credibility. The public outcry and national media attention that was generated by her findings forced the state to re-evaluate its data, however, and both Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder and then-President Barack Obama declared a state of emergency for the area.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHanna-Attisha said that although research results are not normally shared at a press conference, she felt that she had no choice because the families of Flint needed and deserved to know what was going on. She released her findings at a press conference in September 2015.\n\n\u201cLead impacts everybody. It impacts every organ system and every age group, including pets,\u201d she said. \u201cWe worry the most about children, especially those under the age of 6 because that\u2019s when their brains are developing. That\u2019s when their nervous system is developing, and lead most potently is a neurotoxin.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince then, Hanna-Attisha has remained at the forefront of efforts to change public health policy on both the local and national levels, and to meet the needs of children and families who are being impacted by exposure to lead. In 2016 she became director of the newly created Pediatric Public Health Initiative, which is an interdisciplinary collaborative effort between Michigan State University and Hurley Children\u2019s Hospital. The program will provide tools, resources and interventions for improving the health and development of children affected by lead exposure, and it will monitor those children and their families for years to come to assess the effectiveness of those interventions.\n\n\u201cWith PPHI, we are actively trying to flip the story for our kids,\u201d Hanna-Attisha said. \u201cWe are doing work that hasn\u2019t been done before. We very much know what lead does\u2014that science is there. We know what it does to cognition, to behavior, to criminality and to life outcomes, and leaning on the field of developmental neuroscience, we are proactively intervening to preserve the tomorrows of our children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEveryone in Flint\u2014community partners, moms, kids, nonprofits\u2014is rolling up their sleeves to make sure that our kids turn out OK, and really better than OK,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have been able to establish free, year-round child care. We are the only city to have universal preschool. We have Medicaid expansion, we have mobile grocery stores, we have breast-feeding services, mental-health support and positive parenting programs.\n\n\u201cMy kids in Flint continue to be the inspiration for this work,\u201d Hanna-Attisha continued. \u201cThey did absolutely nothing wrong other than to live in an almost bankrupt city that was under state emergency management, where the focus was cutting costs rather than children\u2019s health. As a pediatrician, it\u2019s my job to be an advocate for my patients, to protect and speak up for kids, because they can\u2019t. That\u2019s the privilege and honor of what I do every day.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo that end, Hanna-Attisha is coordinating the establishment of a registry that will track the children of Flint who have been exposed to lead. She was appointed to the 15-member Child Lead Exposure Elimination Commission, which has recommended the mandatory testing of all children for lead poisoning, expanded home-testing requirements and the creation of a statewide database of structures with dangerous lead levels.\n\nHanna-Attisha considers the Heinz Family Foundation award to be a huge honor.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s humbling and it\u2019s an incredible honor to receive this award. It\u2019s prestigious in academics, and it means so much to me because one of the first people to receive this award was a pediatrician named Herb Needleman,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis was a pediatrician who spent his whole life and his whole career on lead,\u201d she explained. \u201cHe was one of the first people to tell us that low levels of lead impact children. He spent much of his career being attacked by the lead industry, but he remained resilient and fought back for children.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cI think it means so much to me because I couldn\u2019t do the work I do without incredible mentors and giants in the field, and he was definitely one of these amazing giants, and my work is possible by being able to stand on the shoulders of him and many others like him.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHanna-Attisha also believes that the award is an excellent way to remind people that the crisis in Flint is ongoing. More than three years after it first began, the people of Flint still do not have clean water in their faucets.\n\nThe Heinz Awards were established to honor the memory of U.S. Sen. John Heinz. The awards have recognized 133 individuals and awarded more than $26 million to its honorees.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe are honored to present this year\u2019s public policy award to Dr. Hanna-Attisha, who in her fight to protect the children and families of Flint has embodied the qualities of courage, wisdom, compassion and grit,\u201d Teresa Heinz, chairman of the Heinz Family Foundation, said. \u201cHer unrelenting effort as a champion for truth, her continued advocacy work on behalf of those who will suffer the effects of lead exposure for years to come, and her commitment to making unsafe drinking water an issue of our nation, exemplify the tremendous impact that one citizen activist can have on our world.\u201d\n\nFor more information about Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha and other Heinz awardees, visit the foundation website.", "keywords": ["foundation", "heinz", "levels", "pediatrician", "public", "national", "lead", "water", "michs", "children", "hannaattisha", "award", "state", "family", "leadcontaminated", "honors", "flint"], "polarity": 0.14733458177278408, "subjectivity": 0.43607187444266093},

Mayor Weaver took up the front row with members of her administration, according to the report. Weaver and her administration have publicly butted heads with the council and insisted that it approve the 30-year contract with GLWA immediately.\n\nMLive-Flint Journal reports that on Friday, the council voted to postpone the vote on the 30-year contract for two weeks as three council members suggested alternative options that could be submitted to the state by the end of the night to avoid penalties.\n\n\u201cMy position is we\u2019ve had two months to hold meetings and subpoena the public,\u201d 1st Ward Councilman Eric Mays said. \u201cNow it\u2019s the day, it\u2019s in the consent agreement. We\u2019re at this deadline day and I\u2019ve done my due diligence.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe rationale for the alternative proposal is how the citizens of Flint have been injured by countless bad decisions by the state government,\u201d Councilman Herbert Winfrey of the 6th Ward said. \u201cIt seems unfair that the state would impose deadlines on a city in an emergency situation induced by the state.\u201d\n\nCouncilwoman Monica Galloway of the 7th Ward suggested that the city continue receiving water on a month-to-month contract, but Councilwoman Kate Fields of the 4th Ward said it was \u201cpremature\u201d and \u201cshortsighted\u201d to write an alternative plan before the end of the night because the council did not have all the facts. She accused Weaver of \u201ctrying to shove the GLWA down our throats.\u201d\n\nWeaver had her say as well, taking the mic to talk about no one speaking up for the people of Flint.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cCouncilwoman Galloway, you made a point when you said our backs were against the wall, but our backs were against the wall from the council that was in place when the former mayor asked for an emergency manager and nobody spoke up for us,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cThey sold our pipe, they took away our revenue source, they went to the KWA for 30 years and $7 million a year, and nobody said one word. ... We\u2019ve been asking for an alternative. We gave you 10 to 12 different options and said, \u2018If you have something better, give it to us.\u2019 We didn\u2019t get it. We need it now.\n\n\u201cOur backs are against the wall because it is a public health issue,\u201d the mayor continued. \u201cSo, what happens with the long-term plan\u2014it eliminates the projected $10 million deficit in the water fund that we\u2019re going to have in June of \u201919. We save $7 million a year in bond repayment to the KWA. The long-term deal lowers the wholesale water rates, so we save between $2 and $2.3 million over the fiscal year, and by not doing the water plant, since we didn\u2019t get the money for what we asked for, we invested in the infrastructure and saved $1 to $2 million annually. This contract needs to be approved, and it needs to be approved tonight.\u201d\n\nRead more at MLive-Flint Journal.", "keywords": ["weaver", "alternative", "longterm", "meeting", "council", "arguments", "mayor", "flint", "water", "ward", "city", "heated", "approves", "members", "contract", "million", "shortterm"], "polarity": 0.025154320987654338, "subjectivity": 0.36558641975308637},

The accolade includes an unrestricted cash award of $250,000.\n\nHanna-Attisha is being recognized for stepping forward to expose the elevated lead levels in children in the city of Flint, Mich.; for the work she put into establishing a comprehensive care and support system for children and families affected by lead exposure; and for igniting a renewed nationwide conversation about lead exposure and drinking-water safety.\n\nAs part of the honor, the doctor will receive an unrestricted cash award of $250,000.\n\nHanna-Attisha is the director of the pediatric residency program at Hurley Medical Center in Flint and an associate professor at Michigan State University College of Human Medicine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2014, shortly after the city of Flint switched its water supply from Lake Huron to the Flint River, residents in the city began complaining about the pungent brown water flowing from their faucets. Although state officials maintained that the water was safe, Hanna-Attisha was not convinced. She had previously studied findings by leading lead researcher and Virginia Tech civil engineering professor Marc Edwards, which indicated that the untreated water in Flint was 19 times more corrosive than the water that had been previously sourced from Lake Huron.\n\nHanna-Attisha told The Root: \u201cWhen anybody in pediatrics or public health hears the word \u2018lead,\u2019 it\u2019s a call to action. We know the science; we know what lead does. It\u2019s an irreversible neurotoxin. There\u2019s huge environmental injustices already with lead. Our country\u2019s most vulnerable children already have higher rates of lead exposure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cLead poisoning impacts a child\u2019s entire future. Their entire life course trajectory ... it impacts how they think, how they act, their behavior,\u201d she added. \u201cWhen I heard the possibility that there was lead in the water, it was a call to action. It was my professional, moral and ethical responsibility to figure out what was going on in our children.\u201d\n\nHanna-Attisha immediately went to work and analyzed data on 2,000 pediatric patients before and after the switch. Her research found that the percentage of children with elevated levels of lead in their blood had almost doubled since the switch, and in some neighborhoods, it had even tripled.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cContrary to what was happening across our nation\u2014where the percentage of children with elevated lead levels had been decreasing because we got lead out of paint and out of gasoline\u2014every year in the nation, in our state and even in our city, the percentage of children with elevated lead levels was going down,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe did a very simple study and looked to see what was happening to lead levels in Flint. We saw that the kids with elevated actually increased with the water switch, and it directly correlated with where the water lead levels were the worst,\u201d Hanna-Attisha explained. \u201cWhere the water lead levels were the highest, we saw the greatest increase in children\u2019s blood lead levels.\u201d\n\nThat research was done in 2015 at \u201crecord speed,\u201d she said.\n\nBecause Hanna-Attisha knew this was a public health emergency, she decided to go public with her findings. Initially, state government officials tried to discount her research and undermine her credibility. The public outcry and national media attention that was generated by her findings forced the state to re-evaluate its data, however, and both Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder and then-President Barack Obama declared a state of emergency for the area.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHanna-Attisha said that although research results are not normally shared at a press conference, she felt that she had no choice because the families of Flint needed and deserved to know what was going on. She released her findings at a press conference in September 2015.\n\n\u201cLead impacts everybody. It impacts every organ system and every age group, including pets,\u201d she said. \u201cWe worry the most about children, especially those under the age of 6 because that\u2019s when their brains are developing. That\u2019s when their nervous system is developing, and lead most potently is a neurotoxin.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince then, Hanna-Attisha has remained at the forefront of efforts to change public health policy on both the local and national levels, and to meet the needs of children and families who are being impacted by exposure to lead. In 2016 she became director of the newly created Pediatric Public Health Initiative, which is an interdisciplinary collaborative effort between Michigan State University and Hurley Children\u2019s Hospital. The program will provide tools, resources and interventions for improving the health and development of children affected by lead exposure, and it will monitor those children and their families for years to come to assess the effectiveness of those interventions.\n\n\u201cWith PPHI, we are actively trying to flip the story for our kids,\u201d Hanna-Attisha said. \u201cWe are doing work that hasn\u2019t been done before. We very much know what lead does\u2014that science is there. We know what it does to cognition, to behavior, to criminality and to life outcomes, and leaning on the field of developmental neuroscience, we are proactively intervening to preserve the tomorrows of our children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEveryone in Flint\u2014community partners, moms, kids, nonprofits\u2014is rolling up their sleeves to make sure that our kids turn out OK, and really better than OK,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have been able to establish free, year-round child care. We are the only city to have universal preschool. We have Medicaid expansion, we have mobile grocery stores, we have breast-feeding services, mental-health support and positive parenting programs.\n\n\u201cMy kids in Flint continue to be the inspiration for this work,\u201d Hanna-Attisha continued. \u201cThey did absolutely nothing wrong other than to live in an almost bankrupt city that was under state emergency management, where the focus was cutting costs rather than children\u2019s health. As a pediatrician, it\u2019s my job to be an advocate for my patients, to protect and speak up for kids, because they can\u2019t. That\u2019s the privilege and honor of what I do every day.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo that end, Hanna-Attisha is coordinating the establishment of a registry that will track the children of Flint who have been exposed to lead. She was appointed to the 15-member Child Lead Exposure Elimination Commission, which has recommended the mandatory testing of all children for lead poisoning, expanded home-testing requirements and the creation of a statewide database of structures with dangerous lead levels.\n\nHanna-Attisha considers the Heinz Family Foundation award to be a huge honor.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s humbling and it\u2019s an incredible honor to receive this award. It\u2019s prestigious in academics, and it means so much to me because one of the first people to receive this award was a pediatrician named Herb Needleman,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis was a pediatrician who spent his whole life and his whole career on lead,\u201d she explained. \u201cHe was one of the first people to tell us that low levels of lead impact children. He spent much of his career being attacked by the lead industry, but he remained resilient and fought back for children.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cI think it means so much to me because I couldn\u2019t do the work I do without incredible mentors and giants in the field, and he was definitely one of these amazing giants, and my work is possible by being able to stand on the shoulders of him and many others like him.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHanna-Attisha also believes that the award is an excellent way to remind people that the crisis in Flint is ongoing. More than three years after it first began, the people of Flint still do not have clean water in their faucets.\n\nThe Heinz Awards were established to honor the memory of U.S. Sen. John Heinz. The awards have recognized 133 individuals and awarded more than $26 million to its honorees.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe are honored to present this year\u2019s public policy award to Dr. Hanna-Attisha, who in her fight to protect the children and families of Flint has embodied the qualities of courage, wisdom, compassion and grit,\u201d Teresa Heinz, chairman of the Heinz Family Foundation, said. \u201cHer unrelenting effort as a champion for truth, her continued advocacy work on behalf of those who will suffer the effects of lead exposure for years to come, and her commitment to making unsafe drinking water an issue of our nation, exemplify the tremendous impact that one citizen activist can have on our world.\u201d\n\nFor more information about Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha and other Heinz awardees, visit the foundation website.", "keywords": ["foundation", "heinz", "levels", "pediatrician", "public", "national", "lead", "water", "michs", "children", "hannaattisha", "award", "state", "family", "leadcontaminated", "honors", "flint"], "polarity": 0.14733458177278408, "subjectivity": 0.43607187444266093},

His ruling indicated that if the city does not act, the state will need to go back to court to file a motion that would get the court to enforce an earlier Oct. 23 deadline.\n\nIn a court filing earlier in October, the DEQ asked the judge to allow Flint Mayor Karen Weaver\u2014who is in support of the GLWA contract\u2014to sign the contract without regard to the council.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo yes.

There are dozens of contenders, but none that have ever truly stuck. Basically, the search for the perfect slur for white people has been like the search for a really good fast-food fish sandwich.\n\n\u201cCracker\u201d is perhaps the most famous one, as it\u2019s been around so long that there are popular modifications to it, most notably \u201ccracka\u201d and the sublime \u201ccracka-ass cracka.\u201d But these feel too retrograde, like one of those insults that seemed old even when it was young. It\u2019s the Morgan Freeman of slurs. \u201cHonky\u201d is corny and stupid, and \u201credneck\u201d and \u201cwhite trash\u201d are both classist and allow white people to be intraracially classist.\n\nRecently, quite a few punny attempts at finding the perfect insult have been created\u2014most notably, \u201cwypipo\u201d and \u201cDwight.\u201d But these might be too \u201cclever.\u201d Too\u2014dare I say it\u2014millennial. Plus, what\u2019s the point of a slur if the people you\u2019re slurring don\u2019t even realize it\u2019s a slur? That\u2019s a waste of a slur! Slur wasting is a sin!\n\nSearching for a slur for white people seemed, well, useless. But in the week following the release of Black Panther, a new contender emerged\u2014one that smashes historical reverence and contemporary snark and pith together into a tasty slur sangria: \u201ccolonizer\u201d!\n\nNow, \u201ccolonizer\u201d isn\u2019t a perfect slur. It doesn\u2019t quite roll off the tongue. Plus, it has four syllables, and all of the best slurs have two or fewer. And it requires at least a superficial understanding of world history to understand the context. The best slurs should work even if you slept through social studies, or if you\u2019re like me and you (mostly) stayed awake in class but didn\u2019t quite know what colonization meant until you read a very illuminating Twitter thread on it in 2011.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost importantly, slurs derive their power from power. The main reason slurs for white Americans don\u2019t quite stick or pack much of a punch is that they still wield most of the power here. Slurs are meant to shame and induce claustrophobia\u2014a sense of perpetual unwelcome. But how unwelcoming can a word be if your status exists as a boundless welcome mat? Colonizer, however, recognizes that dynamic and inverts it by laughing at it instead of lauding it. It\u2019s a Jedi slur trick.\n\nPerhaps \u201ccolonizer\u201d won\u2019t catch. But I think we should give it a test drive for the next three months to see how it rides. And if that doesn\u2019t work, we can always go back to the lab. And who knows? Maybe a new contender will emerge. Personally, I\u2019ve always thought \u201cmayonnaise boy\u201d had potential.

The untreated water from the river was highly corrosive and caused lead to leach into the city\u2019s pipes, leading to contaminated tap water for the residents.\n\nMany government officials of have been charged with crimes in the subsequent fallout, but the city is still without a permanent solution that provides an ongoing source of clean water for the people who live there. When the parties were unable to come to an agreement in June, the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality filed a lawsuit against the city after the City Council refused to approve a long-term water contract with the Great Lakes Water Authority, out of Detroit. The suit alleges that the city is endangering public health.\n\nThere are some helpful things happening in the meantime.\n\nThe Detroit News reports that on Tuesday, U.S. District Judge David Lawson appointed attorney Paul Monicatti to facilitate a mandatory mediation between the city of Flint and the DEQ to settle their differences over the future source of water for the city of Flint. This is a good thing, because the constant bickering is only causing further harm to the residents of the city. You know, those same people the state claims to be advocating for in its lawsuit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMayor Karen Weaver\u2019s office told the Daily Progress that since March 2016, about 2,700 homes have had old water lines replaced through the FAST Start Initiative, a program with a goal of replacing nearly 20,000 lead-tained water lines in the city by the year 2020.\n\nAccording to the Minnesota Star Tribune, Michigan State University, which received a four-year, $14.4 million grant from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, announced Tuesday that it will be using the first installment of that grant to establish a registry of Flint residents who have been exposed to lead since the crisis began in 2014. It will use the $3.2 million to connect people to programs that can help minimize the health problems associated with lead exposure, which include effects on brain development in children.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency announced Tuesday that it will forgive $20.7 million in water debt that the city of Flint incurred through the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund. WCRZ reports that Weaver issued a statement thanking the agency for forgiving the debt and saying, \u201cWe have come a long way, but there is still much more work that needs to be done.

Almost 305,000 people were affected by the break.\n\nOakland County and the Great Lakes Water Authority worked nearly around the clock to ensure that the residents in those communities had safe, potable water. Water stations in various communities were set up. Businesses and residences alike were given access to the scarce commodity.\n\nThey even provided water to flush toilets. Let me repeat that: They were given water to flush their toilets. Of course, people had to bring their own containers, but at least people had access to clean, safe water for plumbing and drinking. All of these efforts are impressive, right? This is a fantastic example of how government officials should respond when a water crisis occurs.\n\nIt directly affected my mother, and as a native Detroiter and former resident of Oakland County, I should\u2019ve been ecstatic to hear how well this situation was handled. So what\u2019s the issue, you ask?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nResidents in the Genesee County city of Flint, Mich., have been without potable, usable water since 2014. Government officials\u2014locally and statewide\u2014blatantly lied about the water supply being safe for human consumption. Fertilizers, pesticides, built-up bacteria and lead have contaminated the Flint River (the city\u2019s primary source) for decades. Their half-assed attempt to \u201cclean up the water\u201d never ensured that the city\u2019s folks would remain healthy.\n\nIt\u2019s been three whole years, and citizens still can\u2019t drink the water. Water stations were set up (some years later), and as of this past summer, many of the stations were closed following Flint\u2019s lead levels being under the federal limit. Why is there such a disparity between Oakland County and Genesee County in their response to each crisis?\n\nRace and class.\n\nOakland County is one of the wealthiest counties in Michigan. It used to be the wealthiest, but some argue that Livingston may have snatched the \u201ccoveted\u201d honor. The median income in Oakland County is roughly $70,000. The county\u2019s population is a whopping 72.8 percent white, which is a glaring contrast to Flint\u2019s 60 percent black population. The median income in Genesee County is about $44,000, but the surprise is that the 72 percent white population of Genesee is typically lower-class and poor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe water crisis in Flint was not just a \u201cblack problem.\u201d It was a class problem. Poor whites have been brainwashed to think that they receive the same consideration as well-to-do whites, and that\u2019s simply not true. Because there are more poor whites, they give the advantage of numbers for rich whites with agendas to use them time and time again. And because skin color matters, they never see they are being consistently shit on.\n\nBlacks have and will always suffer first, which is why nobody jumped to make sure that everyone in the city of Flint had access to clean water\u2014nobody who was supposed to, at least. Flint could easily have been Detroit, Pontiac or any other city with a majority-black population in Michigan.\n\nBusinesses and civilians from various counties throughout Michigan sent batches of water to the good folks of Flint. However, their assistance wasn\u2019t enough to mitigate the long-term damage. Fetal deaths spiked, pregnancy rates lowered, 12 people died from Legionnaires\u2019 disease and lead poisoning debilitated many more people in the city. Given the already high infant mortality and morbidity rates in the city, Flint residents never had a chance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApparently, money will always talk, and black lives will always be expendable.", "keywords": ["oakland", "tale", "genesee", "safe", "county", "whites", "water", "stations", "population", "crises", "mich", "city", "flint"], "polarity": 0.1415183792815372, "subjectivity": 0.4721860206070732},

Along with several others, Nick Lyon, director of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, was charged June 14 with misconduct in office and involuntary manslaughter for his role in the crisis\u2014specifically, for failing to publicize an epidemic of Legionnaires\u2019 disease that ultimately claimed at least a dozen lives.\n\nMichigan Attorney General Bill Schuette alleges that Lyon knew about the epidemic in January 2015\u2014a full year before he went public with the information. But this line of reasoning leads straight to the door of Gov. Rick Snyder\u2019s office\u2014a fact about which most media coverage has been silent.\n\n\n\nWhile most of the attention to Flint has rightly focused on the lead poisoning, the corrosive water flowing for almost two years through copper and lead pipes led to multiple outbreaks of Legionnaires\u2019 disease. Caused by ingesting legionella bacteria, which is most often linked to plumbing systems and other human-made water structures, Legionnaires\u2019 disease is normally rare. Research has linked Flint\u2019s shift in water supplier to the Legionnaires\u2019 outbreak, claiming that the corrosive water from the Flint River damaged pipes and created an environment for the bacteria to multiply and thrive before reaching Flint residents through showers and cooling systems.\n\n\n\nExperts have suggested that 90 percent of the problems associated with water from the Flint River could have been prevented if an anti-corrosive agent had been used to treat the water after shifting from Lake Huron as a primary water source. At a meager $3,000 per month, this treatment would have saved lives.\n\n\n\nInstead, according to Schuette, Lyon sat on information about Legionnaires\u2019 from January 2015 to January 2016\u2014allowing two more waves of the outbreak to pass unchecked and deflecting blame away from the water as a potential source. When Lyon finally announced the Legionnaires\u2019 outbreak publicly on Jan. 13, 2016, Snyder claimed that he had heard of the outbreak only two days earlier.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn October 2016, when the investigation into Lyon was announced, several articles drawing on state emails noted that Harvey Hollins, Snyder\u2019s director of urban initiatives, had been informed of a Legionnaires\u2019 outbreak back in March 2015. Now that Lyon has been charged with failing to act on this knowledge, however, the Legionella connections to Snyder have dropped out of the media coverage.\n\n\n\nOur review of emails released by Snyder shows that Snyder\u2019s then-deputy press secretary Dave Murray knew about the outbreak in January 2015, two months earlier than Hollins. We don\u2019t know if Murray is the first Snyder aide to hear about Legionnaires\u2019 and a possible link to the water. But it places the news directly in Snyder\u2019s office a full year before Snyder said he was told in January 2016, the same time Lyon first heard about the outbreak.\n\nIf we are to believe them, neither Murray nor another two aides notified in March saw Legionnaires\u2019 as serious enough to alert the governor\u2014perhaps because the Department of Environmental Quality employees writing them referred to the possibility of Legionnaires\u2019 as bad public relations rather than a public health problem and called efforts to solve it \u201cpolitical flank cover.\u201d The DEQ also stymied Genesee County efforts to bring in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to help with Legionnaires\u2019, altered dates and delayed public warnings about the outbreak for 10 months.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nObfuscation continued far beyond the public discovery of Legionella. Schuette\u2019s warrant (pdf) for Nick Lyon describes Lyon issuing threats to Wayne State University professors investigating the cause of the outbreak. When they expressed concern that people would die in a new outbreak, Lyon allegedly said, \u201cThey have to die of something.\u201d A senior Snyder adviser was present when Lyon said this, an adviser who told their professors their boss (Snyder) was \u201cvery unhappy\u201d with the professors\u2019 public statement of findings.\n\n\n\nPreviously, we have argued that the state bears ultimate responsibility for Flint, thanks to its imposition of three emergency managers between 2011 and 2015 to make decisions for the city, including about Flint\u2019s water (under a law that wound up locally disenfranchising half of Michigan\u2019s black citizens). More recently, two former Flint emergency managers, Darnell Earley and Gerald Ambrose, have been charged with making false pretenses and misconduct in switching Flint\u2019s water source.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf the decision by a state representative to switch water source was based on fraud, Flint should not be saddled with its costs and consequences. But as yet, the crisis has not sparked a lasting conversation on the emergency manager law\u2019s validity, much less Snyder\u2019s responsibility or reparations for its effects.\n\nThe law has also impeded efforts at achieving justice. Just consider former emergency manager Kurtz\u2019s testimony that his job \u201cdid not include ensuring safe drinking water,\u201d despite his total control over the city when deciding to use the polluted Flint River. The Michigan Civil Rights Commission\u2019s report (pdf) on the crisis concluded that \u201crace played a role in the Flint water crisis precisely because it was never considered,\u201d arguing that systemic racism led to the normalization of problems in poor and minority communities.\n\nThe commission suggests that we must understand the role of structures and institutions and change the very laws to better protect people of color from future harms. Moreover, the commission report finds failure to repair the harm itself evidence of discrimination. Our focus is on the daily failure of empathy white bureaucrats showed to suffering Flint residents and how this drove outcomes.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs our ongoing research is revealing, the state\u2019s indifference to human lives in a majority-black, impoverished city drove their actions (and inactions) in the Flint water crisis. The responsible individuals must be held to account (including the governor), but we must also address the organizational structures that produced and exacerbated the crisis. Only by understanding the more systemic failures will it be clear that Flint deserves not just emergency aid but restorative justice to repair the harm caused by the state.\n\n\n\nThe Root aims to foster and advance conversations about issues relevant to the black Diaspora by presenting a variety of opinions from all perspectives, whether or not those opinions are shared by our editorial staff.\n\nLouise Seamster is a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville; Derek Galyon (political science), Nichole Proctor (sociology and psychology) and Patrick Sonnenberg (linguistics) are undergraduate students at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.

Of course, seeing Wakanda brought up a lot of questions: What\u2019s the deal with those sand-like 3D display systems they have? How do they make such good holographic images come out of stylish bracelets? How fast do those mag-lev trains go? And, perhaps most importantly, what are Wakandan cars like?\n\n\n\nOh, I guess I should mention there will likely be some kind of spoilers here, so, you know, I\u2019m warning you now. Here be spoilers. Run.\n\nNow, while we saw a number of very impressive Wakandan transportation machines: aircraft (possibly spacecraft as well?), mag-lev trains, what looked like a nice light-rail system, we never actually saw any Wakandan rolling, car-like automobiles. Perhaps their cities are designed to not require them, or perhaps they prefer mass-transit and air travel culturally; I\u2019m not really sure. But that\u2019s not going to stop me from doing some speculation about what a Wakandan car could be.\n\nI\u2019m actually thinking of a very specific kind of Wakandan car: a Wakandan export-market car. I\u2019m taking as a jumping-off point the events at the end of the movie, where Wakanda is finally abandoning their centuries-long self-imposed isolation from the world and will now become part of the global community, an act which will include the desemination of advanced Wakandan technology to the world, at least to some degree.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWakandan technology is based on the (again, sadly) fictional element known as Vibranium, of which Wakanda has an incredibly supply of, thanks to a massive meteorite of the stuff buried beneath the country. We see vibranium powering things like Black Panther\u2019s suit, for example, and it\u2019s clearly capable of some incredible things, which is why it\u2019s so incredibly valuable.\n\nI don\u2019t think the Wakandans will try to immediately upgrade the entire planet to the level of technology they enjoy; that would be a colossal undertaking, and not only am I not sure that makes sense for Wakanda, I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s even possible. What I do think will happen is that Wakanda will produce products for global consumption that, while largely similar to existing global technology, and as such are understandable and will work with current global infrastructure, will incorporate some amount of advanced Wakandan vibranum-based tech to make them better in some dramatic way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s what I think the Wakandan car will be like: it\u2019ll be essentially recognizable as a car, in that it will have wheels that can use tires you can buy from any local tire store and you\u2019ll drive it and use it in essentially the same way we use cars now, but it will have a huge vibranium-related advantage. Here\u2019s what I\u2019m imagining this first Wakandan export market car, the Wakanda Motors Ingwe (that\u2019s Xhosa for \u2018panther\u2019 or \u2018puma\u2019) , will be:\n\nIt\u2019ll be a hybrid, fundamentally. But with a very crucial difference. Where the hybrids the rest of the world builds rely on heavy, inefficient chemical storage batteries, the Wakandan car will use the remarkable energy-absorbing and releasing power of vibranium.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019ve seen this power in action in Black Panther\u2019s suit, which has vibranium fibers woven into it. Black Panther gets shot with a bullet, for example, but instead of peeing himself and dying like most of us would, the suit not only stops the bullet, but absorbs the considerable kinetic energy from the bullet, stores it, and later releases it when Black Panther wants to do something like punch a truck through a building.\n\nThe WM Ingwe would use this kinetic energy-storage and release property of vibranium to replace the heavy batteries of a hybrid. By building the cars with an alloy of aluminum and vibranium for the main parts of the frame, and perhaps some of the main body panels, the Wakandan car would have a structure that\u2019s not just light and incredibly strong, but capable of storing vast amounts of energy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause vibranium has so far only been shown as something that can store and release energy, not generate it, we\u2019d still need to provide some initial source energy into the system. It may be possible to set up some sort of \u2018charging stations\u2019 which input energy into the vibranium frame of the car, allowing for a purely electric vehicle, but I was thinking it might be more useful for these cars to use a small internal combustion engine to act as an initial source of energy; It could be a fairly small motor, one liter or less, maybe something equivalent to one of the small three-cylinder motors being built by Ford, GM, Mitsubishi, BMW, whoever.\n\nMaybe this part will be sourced outside of Wakanda, or maybe some Wakandan researchers will have fun developing a tiny, powerful ICE engine of their own. It doesn\u2019t really matter. My guess is it would be a better PR move if they partnered with local companies to produce this part of the car.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(Actually, now that I think about it, probably the best move to keep from overly disrupting the global economy would be for them to just license the fundamental technology and provide the needed vibranium to companies all over the world. In that sense, think of the WM Ingwe as a sort of low-volume reference vehicle, with versions of the basic tech produced by established carmakers, under license.)\n\nThe ICE motor would get things started, turning gasoline or diesel into kinetic energy that would start \u2018charging\u2019 the vibranium frame, which would then provide power output to the main electric motor driving the rear axles. Let\u2019s say this is a Wakandan-designed motor, a scaled-down version of what they\u2019re already making for their trains or mining equipment or hover-ship windshield wipers. Based on their technological prowess with this stuff, I imagine this could be a pretty potent motor, certainly comparable to what Teslas use. Let\u2019s say it can produce a peak horsepower of 500, because why not.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnce in motion, the vibranium frame and body panels are collecting every bit of kinetic energy they encounter\u2014the molecules of air that hit the body of the car will transfer their kinetic energy to the system, the vibrations of the road, the motions of the passengers inside, along with more traditional energy reclamation systems like regenerative braking.\n\nHell, if the car was sitting for a while, and you forgot to put fuel in the ICE motor, you could probably get a good 10 or 20 miles of range by just pounding on the hood with your fists for a few minutes.\n\nVibranium has been shown to be incredibly effective at harvesting ambient kinetic energy; a few minutes of ICE-assisted driving would likely be enough to charge the vibranium up to the point where you could travel for 200 to 300 miles before needing to restart the gas engine\u2014perhaps more if it was windy, or if you, say, got caught in a rainstorm, with each raindrop adding a nice burst of energy to the car as it impacted the vibranium-alloy roof and hood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat you\u2019d have, essentially, is a hybrid car without the biggest disadvantage of a hybrid: the heavy, inefficient battery. The vibranium frame and body panels would be both an incredibly strong and safe structure for the car as well as all the energy storage the car needs. You could shave hundreds and hundreds of pounds from cars, eliminate the difficult and environmentally troubling mining of resources like lithium, and never worry about finding a charging station or if your battery pack is going to degrade to uselessness after 10 years.\n\nWith a car like this, the Wakandans could make every Prius (and likely Tesla) on the road obsolete overnight. Wakandan vibranium technology has the potential to make incredibly efficient automobiles without sacrificing range or performance. I can\u2019t wait until we start seeing these things on the market\u2014you\u2019d have to be an idiot to buy anything that didn\u2019t use Wakandan vibranium-based tech.\n\nOh, shit, right.

I had no idea what to expect, but more important, I had no idea what to wear! I was going to a place where being a geek was highly encouraged\u2014and I couldn\u2019t contain my joy (retroactive shoutout to my dad and his girlfriend for dealing with 18-year-old me in the backseat of their car en route to the venue).\n\n\n\nIn the end, I decided on a Gundam Wing-themed ensemble that consisted of a mecha anime shirt and a rather stylish baseball cap. I\u2019d be the cutest black nerd that ever did nerd, and people could @ me all day about Gundam pilots ...\n\nThen I saw a dude walking down the street toward the convention dressed as Vash the Stampede.\n\nGIF Image: Giphy\n\nSlick red coat. Cartoonishly spiky hair. Boots and a wicked pair of shades. It was as if he\u2019d stepped out of Trigun to take a stroll through Rosemont, Ill. Not to borrow from an all-too-common misconception, but I really did think it was a bit too early to be trick-or-treating. But there were entire groups of costumed people walking down the sidewalk, some dressed in geek apparel, while others wore meatball-headed wigs to portray champions of love and justice. I was equal parts confused and intrigued.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGIF Image: Giphy\n\nAfter I got my badge and met up with my, ahem, \u201cfriend\u201d (now partner\u2014sorry, Dad), she explained what I was seeing. Attendees were participating in cosplay, which is when you emulate your favorite fictional characters by playing an elaborate game of dress-up. This ranges from replicating their most iconic outfits to doing variations of them in your own style. It\u2019s not exclusive to nerd culture, either, since pop-culture icons can be seen wandering the convention halls. Oh, and don\u2019t get me started on the costume crossovers. You haven\u2019t lived until you\u2019ve seen the Ronald McDonald and Colonel Sanders version of Final Fantasy VII\u2019s Sephiroth and Cloud. (Google. It. Now.)\n\nPhoto: Steve B\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen the weekend ended, I immediately went on the hunt for characters I could cosplay. I searched all over the internet for a fat, black, queer female character I could bring to the next convention I went to. I\u2019m sure you let out a sad little laugh as you read that sentence. There aren\u2019t too many characters who fill those requirements today, let alone in 2002. But maybe I could take the \u201cqueer\u201d out, or even the \u201cfat\u201d or \u201cblack\u201d if I was brave enough (spoiler: I wasn\u2019t). Eventually, I decided that cosplay wasn\u2019t for me and left the idea in my dorm room.\n\nThis is the story a lot of black cosplayers tell about the first time they decided to give cosplay a shot. Thankfully, many of us eventually say \u201cTo hell with it,\u201d and cosplay whomever we want. That\u2019s what I did in 2004. I was so into Yu Yu Hakusho that when a friend said they were cosplaying from it, I jumped at the chance to join them\u2014even though there wasn\u2019t a single character who looked like me.\n\nBut see, that\u2019s what cosplay is all about! You should cosplay whatever character you want\u2014and I do, all the time. I\u2019ll even alter a character\u2019s outfit and have my partner make it in a style that I\u2019m comfortable with.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut damn, it\u2019d be nice to have options, you know? Canonical options that don\u2019t lead to being labeled the black version of a character. When you\u2019re forever on team #RepresentationMatters, you want to be able to look at a character roster and say, \u201cThat\u2019s me!\u201d\n\nThe reality is that black cosplayers don\u2019t have as many candidates as our white counterparts. And yes, I see you typing that list of black characters in the comments, so let me fill you in on a little secret: We all have that list framed in our living rooms. It\u2019s part of the Black Cosplay Care Package (trademark pending), and it still doesn\u2019t negate the fact that there\u2019s one black ranger in a team of five\u2014or six, depending on Tommy\u2019s mood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s why we get excited when we see the likes of Black Lightning and Black Panther or hear news about an iconic character being reimagined as a black hero or heroine. We love Iron Man, but as soon as news broke that a black woman was going to wear the suit? We were on it in no time.\n\nImage: Mike McKone (Marvel Comics)\n\nYou know, there\u2019s this common thing new cosplayers do where they ask who they should cosplay based on their looks. My partner hates it because she feels you should look at the character you like, not worry about how accurately you can portray someone. But when you\u2019re a fat black girl, you kinda can\u2019t help searching for yourself\u2014and getting discouraged when you\u2019re not present.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI will always cosplay whatever character I\u2019m feeling at that moment, but I\u2019ll also always remember the 18-year-old me who felt so excluded from the group she wanted to be a part of. She\u2014and others like her\u2014deserve more options.\n\n", "keywords": ["characters", "wasnt", "nerd", "thats", "convention", "character", "cosplay", "nice", "black", "28daysofblackcosplay", "options", "youre"], "polarity": 0.12145721608408172, "subjectivity": 0.48781837565419656},

I want a job where I can be on the street to possibly kill more unarmed black men,\u201d so she resigns. Then, in the last scene, she walks into the sunset ... no, even better, she gets a job as a sheriff\u2019s officer, with a gun and everything. She lives happily ever after. Orchestra music plays. Fade to black. Credits roll.\n\nYou\u2019d kick me out of your office. You\u2019d tell me it was too \u201con the nose\u201d and didn\u2019t have enough nuance. \u201cSure, the world is racist,\u201d you\u2019d say. \u201cBut not that racist.\u201d You\u2019d think no one would go see that movie. \u201cIt\u2019s too unbelievable,\u201d you\u2019d say.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBetty Shelby, the former Tulsa, Okla., police officer acquitted of killing Terence Crutcher in cold blood\u2014even though there are two videos that show her killing Crutcher in cold blood\u2014has a brand-new job as a reserve deputy with the Rogers County (Okla.) Sheriff\u2019s Office, according to several sources, including the Tulsa World.\n\n\n\nShelby was sworn in by the RCSO during a live press conference Thursday morning surrounded by Sheriff Scott Walton, county officials and well-wishers. The county doesn\u2019t usually hold press conferences for swearing-in ceremonies, but because of the high profile of Shelby\u2019s case and Walton\u2019s vociferous support of her during her trial, Rogers County apparently thought it necessary to flaunt the fact that it was hiring a cold-blooded killer, because ... fuck Terence Crutcher.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring Shelby\u2019s terrible ordeal, in which she had to endure months of freedom, getting paid without actually working and not being dead, Walton posted at least three letters on the RCSO Facebook page offering support and slamming Shelby\u2019s critics, calling her a \u201csacrificial lamb.\u201d\n\nThis is why Crutcher is dead. This is why Mike Brown is dead. This is why Tamir Rice is dead. This is why John Crawford is dead. It is not just because of the juries who acquit the thieves who rob the world of black lives. It is not simply because of the apathy of men and women in blue uniforms toward the black citizens they are sworn to protect and serve. It is because they know they will never suffer any repercussions for cold-blooded murder under the authority of the law.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot only are they never punished; they also prosper. And they prosper so that they can do it again.\n\nTake Timothy Loehmann, for instance. Loehmann worked as a police officer in Independence, Ohio. His supervisor there recommended his termination for lying, insubordination and being unable to perform his duties. Instead of being fired for being a terrible police officer, he was allowed to resign so that he could get another job as a cop, paving the way for him to shoot 12-year-old Tamir Rice as the youngster played in a Cleveland park in 2014. Even though Loehmann shot Tamir two seconds after he spotted the kid playing in a park, Loehmann never faced charges and kept working for the Cleveland Police Department until May 30, 2017.\n\nNew York City Police Officer Daniel Pantaleo had been accused of police violations and had been sued three times for falsely arresting black men before he murdered stopped Eric Garner from breathing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe police officers in Jennings, Mo., were so notoriously racist, the department eventually had to fire every officer on the force and bring in new officers. Most of the officers kept working. One of those officers\u2014Darren Wilson\u2014landed a better-paying job in Ferguson, Mo., and patrolled the streets there until he shot Mike Brown six times on Aug. 9, 2014.\n\n\u201cBut she was acquitted,\u201d some people will say of Betty Shelby. \u201cIn America, you are innocent until proven guilty. You can\u2019t persecute her if she isn\u2019t guilty of a crime.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d said the long-dead corpses of Tamir Rice, Eric Garner, Mike Brown and Terence Crutcher.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: Tamir, Garner, Brown and Crutcher didn\u2019t actually say that because ... you know.\n\nRead more at the Tulsa World and News 9.\n\n", "keywords": ["say", "stop", "crutcher", "job", "killing", "tamir", "working", "wont", "dead", "betty", "youd", "shelbys", "cops", "black", "officer", "world"], "polarity": -0.05829423264907135, "subjectivity": 0.5394374621793976},

The self-assured, witty and unapologetically brilliant younger sister of T\u2019Challa has not only won over millions of Black Panther fans but, experts note, may also be turning a generation of young girls\u2014black girls in particular\u2014on to STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) fields.\n\nBut is the world of STEM ready for them? Earlier this month, The Glow Up spoke to Jessie Woolley-Wilson, CEO of DreamBox Learning and one of the few black female CEOs in tech, to ask her thoughts on how to foster interest in STEM work; what companies can do to keep and nurture the talent that\u2019s already there; and how she\u2019s trying to make her workplace a safer, more inclusive and supportive space for workers of all backgrounds.\n\nAs FiveThirtyEight noted in a recent article (h/t to Damon Young at Very Smart Brothas), \u201cThe volume of evidence shows that when audiences see on-screen representations of themselves, particularly aspirational ones, that experience can fundamentally change how they perceive their own place in the world.\u201d\n\n\n\nDreamBox Learning provides online math education software for children. Even as a CEO, Woolley-Wilson says she still sometimes gets mistaken for support staff while waiting to be called in to a road show presentation for potential buyers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMany people that I encounter are just not prepared,\u201d Woolley-Wilson tells The Glow Up. \u201cThey\u2019re not used to seeing a black woman walk in the door and ask for $10 million of funding.\u201d\n\n\ufeff\u201cI said, \u2018What if they close the doors?\u2019 And she said, \u2018Well, how many doors do you have access to?\u2019\u201d\n\nClosing the math gap and creating equity in opportunity and achievement is part of what drives Woolley-Wilson, and her company could very well soon become one of the tools that real-life Shuris have to gain comfort and familiarity with math.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m devoting my career to unlocking the learning potential of every child regardless of where they live, what zip code they live in, or what they look like or what language they speak,\u201d Woolley-Wilson says.\n\nBuilding an industry where more leaders look like her, Woolley-Wilson says, means fostering education, exposure and cultivation. And when it comes to education, she says, parents and educators need to be willing to part from a generalized approach and get specific, even at a young age.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important to start STEM young so that kids get exposure,\u201d she points out. \u201cWhen kids are exposed to STEM fields earlier, with specialties, they thrive. They do well.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSecond, students need to understand the relevance of math and broaden their understanding of how it applies to their lives. This is especially important, Woolley-Wilson says, because math is the \u201cunderpinning of science, technology and engineering.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just because everyone should grow up and be a coder or an engineer,\u201d Woolley-Wilson says. \u201cBut technology is transforming how we live. The algorithms that drive Facebook, the algorithms that help people to compose music .... All of those things are impacted by mathematics.\u201d\n\nWoolley-Wilson lauds the work of organizations like Black Girls Code, an organization she says she loves because it\u2019s about creating fundamental shifts in belief \u201cin the hearts and minds of young black girls and in employers about what young black girls can do in engineering and coding.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of Jessie Woolley-Wilson\n\nBut apart from building mathematical and technical skills, there is the importance of building leadership skills at a young age, something, she also notes, you don\u2019t necessarily pick up in school.\n\n\u201cI think about my background; I think about how did I learn to be a leader? I didn\u2019t go to school to be a leader,\u201d Woolley-Wilson says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, she says, her earliest and most formative experiences with leadership came from being a Brownie and a Girl Scout.\n\n\u201cI learned sales, territory management; I learned inventory management. I learned presentation skills. I learned financial skills,\u201d she says. \u201cThey weren\u2019t labeled as such, but my mother was not one of these mothers who sold my Girl Scout cookies for me. She forced me to go out and knock on doors.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018What if they close the doors?\u2019 And she said, \u2018Well, how many doors do you have access to?\u2019\u201d Woolley-Wilson adds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne way to build those opportunities for exposure, Woolley-Wilson says, is for girls of color to see those possibilities for themselves \u201cin flesh and blood.\u201d She advocates giving young people six-week stints in different environments, \u201cwhere they will have enough opportunity to experience somebody like me and to ask questions about how I got there so that they could discover it\u2019s not very planned.\u201d\n\nOf course, Woolley-Wilson isn\u2019t just concerned with raising the future; she also wants to prepare women in the field today who are ready to take on more responsibilities and greater roles within the industry. She notes that social media has made it easier to find and recruit diverse candidates, but the work of achieving gender and racial parity in tech doesn\u2019t stop at recruitment. Once a hire is made, Woolley-Wilson says, it\u2019s important to understand people\u2019s aspirations and goals.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA lot of that work is on the company, she notes.\n\n\u201cWe need to make sure that ... we are still actively and intentionally soliciting input from diverse candidates about what their career aspirations are,\u201d she says. \u201cWe need to make sure that we articulate what the success requirements are for internal progression. We need to encourage lateral moves, so that they can have a more well-rounded experience and skill set to prepare them for leadership and to be successful in leadership.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to invest in them, in their leadership development, through internal coaching and through external coaching,\u201d she continues. \u201cAnd we need to make a commitment that internal progression, career development is very important.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause Woolley-Wilson is one of the few black women in major leadership positions in tech, she says she\u2019s often sought after for mentorship from other women and people of color.\n\n\u201cI do as much of that as I can,\u201d Woolley-Wilson says, \u201cbut the thing that I oftentimes remind young promising talent is that there were so many people who helped me and mentored me, and they still do today, who don\u2019t look anything like me. Who didn\u2019t grow up anything like I did. Who don\u2019t resemble me and my family at all.\u201d\n\nAs one recent survey of diversity in the tech industry found, 76 percent of technical jobs are held by men. And when it comes to the total workforce, black and Latinx people make up only 5 percent. The tech industry\u2019s woeful diversity numbers do mean that seeking out mentors who share one\u2019s background puts enormous pressure and time constraints on a select group of people\u2014and could leave new talent in the dust. Woolley-Wilson says she doesn\u2019t want women of color to limit their opportunities in this way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt frustrates me sometimes when people see people like me and they see us as anomalies, and what I know is that there are a lot of people more talented, more capable than I am that just are not discovered yet.\u201d\ufeff\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s more opportunity for people if they open that aperture and consider anybody who really shares their passion and their beliefs,\u201d she says.\n\nShe does emphasize the importance of creating support groups for minorities in the industry, as well as supporting the initiatives and work of people who are trying to make tech a more inclusive space. She cites the work of Ellen Pao and Project Include. Woolley-Wilson balks at the notion that just because she\u2019s a black female CEO means that she has diversity and inclusion figured out, which was part of the reason she participated in the initiative.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was more work. It was more exposure, but it was a way to signal the importance of this, and I know that Ellen is deeply appreciative of that,\u201d she says.\n\nAs was true in Black Panther, what was good for the women of Wakanda was good for the nation. Fostering their strength and their abilities helped the greater good\u2014whether it was building vibranium-powered trains or protecting the nation. The same is true for industry. Woolley-Wilson notes what the data overwhelmingly shows: that diversity within a business is good for business.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think that the most important thing for ed-tech leaders is to understand that the world is changing, there\u2019s a demographic imperative out there that is not going to change,\u201d she says. \u201cGrowth is now inextricably linked to our ability to tap into the promise of diverse population.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt frustrates me sometimes when people see people like me and they see us as anomalies, and what I know is that there are a lot of people more talented, more capable than I am that just are not discovered yet,\u201d Woolley-Wilson says.", "keywords": ["need", "woolleywilson", "stem", "raise", "leadership", "work", "takes", "women", "jessie", "girls", "young", "tech", "math", "black", "shuris", "world"], "polarity": 0.20187201687201686, "subjectivity": 0.4946342238008904},

Mayor Weaver took up the front row with members of her administration, according to the report. Weaver and her administration have publicly butted heads with the council and insisted that it approve the 30-year contract with GLWA immediately.\n\nMLive-Flint Journal reports that on Friday, the council voted to postpone the vote on the 30-year contract for two weeks as three council members suggested alternative options that could be submitted to the state by the end of the night to avoid penalties.\n\n\u201cMy position is we\u2019ve had two months to hold meetings and subpoena the public,\u201d 1st Ward Councilman Eric Mays said. \u201cNow it\u2019s the day, it\u2019s in the consent agreement.

She accused Weaver of \u201ctrying to shove the GLWA down our throats.\u201d\n\nWeaver had her say as well, taking the mic to talk about no one speaking up for the people of Flint.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cCouncilwoman Galloway, you made a point when you said our backs were against the wall, but our backs were against the wall from the council that was in place when the former mayor asked for an emergency manager and nobody spoke up for us,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cThey sold our pipe, they took away our revenue source, they went to the KWA for 30 years and $7 million a year, and nobody said one word. ... We\u2019ve been asking for an alternative. We gave you 10 to 12 different options and said, \u2018If you have something better, give it to us.\u2019 We didn\u2019t get it. We need it now.\n\n\u201cOur backs are against the wall because it is a public health issue,\u201d the mayor continued. \u201cSo, what happens with the long-term plan\u2014it eliminates the projected $10 million deficit in the water fund that we\u2019re going to have in June of \u201919. We save $7 million a year in bond repayment to the KWA. The long-term deal lowers the wholesale water rates, so we save between $2 and $2.3 million over the fiscal year, and by not doing the water plant, since we didn\u2019t get the money for what we asked for, we invested in the infrastructure and saved $1 to $2 million annually. This contract needs to be approved, and it needs to be approved tonight.\u201d\n\nRead more at MLive-Flint Journal.", "keywords": ["weaver", "alternative", "longterm", "meeting", "council", "arguments", "mayor", "flint", "water", "ward", "city", "heated", "approves", "members", "contract", "million", "shortterm"], "polarity": 0.025154320987654338, "subjectivity": 0.36558641975308637},

Those who received the notices have water bills that have not been paid for six months or more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCity leaders in support of the liens said they were in a bind and needed the cash.\n\nHowever, unless Mayor Karen Weaver vetoes the council resolution, those residents will no longer have to worry about tax liens for now.\n\nFrom Michigan Radio:\n\nThe resolution states that no water account with a delinquent balance dating back to April 2014 will have liens placed on the corresponding property. Councilman Eric Mays abstained from voting on the resolution; the remaining eight Council members all voted in favor. Nelson says the city attorney and chief financial officer called his office urging him not to pass a moratorium on placing liens on properties because the city needs the revenue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time out for that,\u201d Nelson told Michigan Radio. \u201cThe people of this city are suffering. They\u2019re troubled, they\u2019re at their wits\u2019 end. ... We\u2019ve got to do what we can do. I\u2019ve done what I can do.\u201d\n\nMays told Michigan Radio that he abstained from voting because he never had a chance to review the resolution, and he had unanswered legal questions about it.\n\n\u201cThe ordinance can\u2019t go back retroactively and pull liens off houses that have already been lost. That was the main reason,\u201d Mays said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrior to the council meeting, the American Civil Liberties Union and the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund stepped in and urged the City Council \u201cto suspend local efforts to impose property liens on thousands of Flint homeowners for failing to pay delinquent bills for contaminated municipal water\u2014which has been unsafe to drink for more than three years,\u201d the Detroit Metro Times reports.\n\nFrom the Metro Times:\n\nKary Moss, the executive director of the ACLU of Michigan described the water bills as exorbitant and unjust, and told the Council, \u201cThe city has the power to put a moratorium on home foreclosures which is the only equitable solution resulting from this tragedy. The suffering of Flint residents should not be compounded by the loss of their homes.\u201d Moss added: \u201cNo one should be expected to pay for water that is not safe, and that has caused so much physical, psychological and financial damage. In a city where residents have been crying out for justice, even more injustice is being proposed.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichigan Radio reports that Mayor Weaver was also sent a copy of the letter from the ACLU and NAACP LDF, and she responded in a Tuesday statement saying her hands were tied by a city ordinance.\n\n\u201cThe city of Flint is legally obligated to comply with some city and state statutes that are not suitable or appropriate when you consider the extenuating circumstances we are still facing,\u201d Weaver said.\n\nRead more at Michigan Radio and the Detroit Metro Times.", "keywords": ["residents", "stop", "tax", "issuing", "told", "liens", "council", "water", "michigan", "radio", "bills", "unpaid", "city", "resolution", "votes", "flint"], "polarity": 0.09349206349206349, "subjectivity": 0.3755839002267573},

The alternates are one black man and one white woman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShelby shot and killed Crutcher after approaching him on a Tulsa highway on Sept. 16 after his car broke down. Video footage of the incident showed Crutcher walking away from officers with his hands up prior to his death.\n\nAs ABC News reports, the Tulsa County District Attorney\u2019s Office charges that Shelby \u201creacted unreasonably by escalating the situation from a confrontation with Mr. Crutcher, who was not responding to verbal commands and was walking away from her with his hands help up, becoming emotionally involved to the point that she overreacted.\u201d\n\nThe Tulsa World notes that Assistant District Attorney Kevin Gray portrayed the 43-year-old Shelby as an overly emotional officer whose unnecessary fear of Crutcher resulted in his bleeding to death because no one assisted him for more than two minutes after he dropped to the ground after being shot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was just a couple of minutes. You\u2019re gonna spend the next week or so listening to evidence about those couple of minutes,\u201d Gray said.\n\nHe also suggested that Shelby received special treatment from the Police Department when she was allowed to take a look at all the police videotape before making her statement to detectives days after the shooting occurred, according to ABC.\n\nDistrict Attorney Steve Kunzweiler told jurors that \u201cskin color is an issue in the case,\u201d something that Shelby herself denied in a 60 Minutes interview prior to her trial and something that her defense attorneys also refute, the Tulsa World reports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShelby\u2019s attorneys are arguing that Shelby repeatedly ordered Crutcher to stop walking and to get on the ground, claiming that Shelby feared for her life and thought that Crutcher was reaching into his vehicle to grab a gun, ABC reports.\n\nDefense attorney Shannon McMurray called Shelby a model officer who followed her training that day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cShe gave him every opportunity to comply, the evidence will show you,\u201d McMurray told the court. \u201cThis was a rush to file charges. ... And when you look at the whole picture, all the evidence will show this.\n\n\u201cSomebody did act unreasonably and in the heat of passion and out of fear, but it was not Betty Shelby. It was [District Attorney] Steve Kunzweiler,\u201d McMurray added, according to the Tulsa World. \u201cWhat he did was not protocol. \u2026 He went after [Tulsa Police Sgt.] Dave Walker, the lead detective, and had [District Attorney\u2019s Office investigator] Doug Campbell \u2026 step in and do things.\u201d\n\nMcMurray underlined that Shelby had never fired her service weapon while on duty prior to the Sept. 16 shooting. The attorney also emphasized that three people had called in about Crutcher\u2019s \u201cerratic\u201d behavior that day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShelby was not aware of those reports during her encounter with Crutcher, of course, but McMurray claimed that Shelby\u2019s training gave her reason to believe that he was under the influence of PCP and had a gun.\n\n\u201cWhen someone\u2019s going for lethal, you do not go less lethal,\u201d she said, referencing Shelby\u2019s decision to draw her gun rather than her Taser.\n\nCrutcher, as we all know, did not have a weapon on his body or in his vehicle. An autopsy report did indicate that he had acute PCP intoxication when he died, but it was not listed as a contributing factor in his death.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCrutcher\u2019s family has said that any emphasis on the drug in his system is a distraction from the fact that Shelby shot an unarmed man. Tulsa County District Judge Doug Drummond issued a pretrial ruling prohibiting the defense from making claims about Crutcher being a habitual user of the drug or referencing his history with the criminal-justice system, since Shelby knew neither of those things at the time of the shooting.\n\nSix witnesses also testified Wednesday, including Officers Tyler Turnbough\u2014Shelby\u2019s backing officer\u2014and Michael Richert, who was in a helicopter overhead with Shelby\u2019s husband. The witnesses acknowledged that they did not hear Crutcher say anything or do anything that indicated that he planned to attack any of the officers on the scene.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRichert was the one who could be heard on police footage saying that Crutcher \u201clooks like a bad dude\u201d who \u201ccould be on something\u201d just before the shooting.\n\nHe testified that he \u201chad no idea\u201d whether Crutcher was, in fact, under the influence of any substance.\n\n\u201cI was basing those statements on everything in the totality of the circumstances,\u201d he said, according to the Tulsa World.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnce back on the ground, Richert testified that he and Shelby spoke briefly and he heard her say, \u201cI can\u2019t believe he made me do it.\u201d\n\nTurnbough was the first officer who arrived on scene after Shelby. He, as it turns out, opted to deploy his Taser against Crutcher at the same time Shelby shot him, sending an electric current through Crutcher\u2019s body twice.\n\n\u201cIt was obvious there was something that transpired before I arrived,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cthe situation made me a little uneasy, a little edgy.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTurnbough said that he didn\u2019t realize that Crutcher had been shot until a few seconds into the second electric current, when he saw blood coming through his white T-shirt.\n\nHe said that he decided to deploy his Taser when he saw Crutcher reach his left hand into the driver\u2019s-side-door pocket through the window of his SUV.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know that she had fired,\u201d Turnbough said. \u201cWhen I fired my Taser \u2026 I thought it was extra loud.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother officer, Dave Montgomery, who is a member of the Critical Incident Response Team, testified that he drove Shelby back to the Gilcrease Division headquarters after the shooting and attempted to help her stay collected.\n\nMontgomery said that Shelby became visibly emotional as she waited for investigators to take her service weapon and her photograph, asking several times, \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t he listen?

Along with several others, Nick Lyon, director of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, was charged June 14 with misconduct in office and involuntary manslaughter for his role in the crisis\u2014specifically, for failing to publicize an epidemic of Legionnaires\u2019 disease that ultimately claimed at least a dozen lives.\n\nMichigan Attorney General Bill Schuette alleges that Lyon knew about the epidemic in January 2015\u2014a full year before he went public with the information. But this line of reasoning leads straight to the door of Gov. Rick Snyder\u2019s office\u2014a fact about which most media coverage has been silent.\n\n\n\nWhile most of the attention to Flint has rightly focused on the lead poisoning, the corrosive water flowing for almost two years through copper and lead pipes led to multiple outbreaks of Legionnaires\u2019 disease. Caused by ingesting legionella bacteria, which is most often linked to plumbing systems and other human-made water structures, Legionnaires\u2019 disease is normally rare. Research has linked Flint\u2019s shift in water supplier to the Legionnaires\u2019 outbreak, claiming that the corrosive water from the Flint River damaged pipes and created an environment for the bacteria to multiply and thrive before reaching Flint residents through showers and cooling systems.\n\n\n\nExperts have suggested that 90 percent of the problems associated with water from the Flint River could have been prevented if an anti-corrosive agent had been used to treat the water after shifting from Lake Huron as a primary water source. At a meager $3,000 per month, this treatment would have saved lives.\n\n\n\nInstead, according to Schuette, Lyon sat on information about Legionnaires\u2019 from January 2015 to January 2016\u2014allowing two more waves of the outbreak to pass unchecked and deflecting blame away from the water as a potential source. When Lyon finally announced the Legionnaires\u2019 outbreak publicly on Jan. 13, 2016, Snyder claimed that he had heard of the outbreak only two days earlier.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn October 2016, when the investigation into Lyon was announced, several articles drawing on state emails noted that Harvey Hollins, Snyder\u2019s director of urban initiatives, had been informed of a Legionnaires\u2019 outbreak back in March 2015. Now that Lyon has been charged with failing to act on this knowledge, however, the Legionella connections to Snyder have dropped out of the media coverage.\n\n\n\nOur review of emails released by Snyder shows that Snyder\u2019s then-deputy press secretary Dave Murray knew about the outbreak in January 2015, two months earlier than Hollins. We don\u2019t know if Murray is the first Snyder aide to hear about Legionnaires\u2019 and a possible link to the water. But it places the news directly in Snyder\u2019s office a full year before Snyder said he was told in January 2016, the same time Lyon first heard about the outbreak.\n\nIf we are to believe them, neither Murray nor another two aides notified in March saw Legionnaires\u2019 as serious enough to alert the governor\u2014perhaps because the Department of Environmental Quality employees writing them referred to the possibility of Legionnaires\u2019 as bad public relations rather than a public health problem and called efforts to solve it \u201cpolitical flank cover.\u201d The DEQ also stymied Genesee County efforts to bring in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to help with Legionnaires\u2019, altered dates and delayed public warnings about the outbreak for 10 months.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nObfuscation continued far beyond the public discovery of Legionella. Schuette\u2019s warrant (pdf) for Nick Lyon describes Lyon issuing threats to Wayne State University professors investigating the cause of the outbreak. When they expressed concern that people would die in a new outbreak, Lyon allegedly said, \u201cThey have to die of something.\u201d A senior Snyder adviser was present when Lyon said this, an adviser who told their professors their boss (Snyder) was \u201cvery unhappy\u201d with the professors\u2019 public statement of findings.\n\n\n\nPreviously, we have argued that the state bears ultimate responsibility for Flint, thanks to its imposition of three emergency managers between 2011 and 2015 to make decisions for the city, including about Flint\u2019s water (under a law that wound up locally disenfranchising half of Michigan\u2019s black citizens). More recently, two former Flint emergency managers, Darnell Earley and Gerald Ambrose, have been charged with making false pretenses and misconduct in switching Flint\u2019s water source.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf the decision by a state representative to switch water source was based on fraud, Flint should not be saddled with its costs and consequences. But as yet, the crisis has not sparked a lasting conversation on the emergency manager law\u2019s validity, much less Snyder\u2019s responsibility or reparations for its effects.\n\nThe law has also impeded efforts at achieving justice. Just consider former emergency manager Kurtz\u2019s testimony that his job \u201cdid not include ensuring safe drinking water,\u201d despite his total control over the city when deciding to use the polluted Flint River. The Michigan Civil Rights Commission\u2019s report (pdf) on the crisis concluded that \u201crace played a role in the Flint water crisis precisely because it was never considered,\u201d arguing that systemic racism led to the normalization of problems in poor and minority communities.\n\nThe commission suggests that we must understand the role of structures and institutions and change the very laws to better protect people of color from future harms. Moreover, the commission report finds failure to repair the harm itself evidence of discrimination. Our focus is on the daily failure of empathy white bureaucrats showed to suffering Flint residents and how this drove outcomes.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs our ongoing research is revealing, the state\u2019s indifference to human lives in a majority-black, impoverished city drove their actions (and inactions) in the Flint water crisis. The responsible individuals must be held to account (including the governor), but we must also address the organizational structures that produced and exacerbated the crisis. Only by understanding the more systemic failures will it be clear that Flint deserves not just emergency aid but restorative justice to repair the harm caused by the state.\n\n\n\nThe Root aims to foster and advance conversations about issues relevant to the black Diaspora by presenting a variety of opinions from all perspectives, whether or not those opinions are shared by our editorial staff.\n\nLouise Seamster is a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville; Derek Galyon (political science), Nichole Proctor (sociology and psychology) and Patrick Sonnenberg (linguistics) are undergraduate students at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.

As a result, toxic lead started to taint the water of unsuspecting residents, many of whom became ill. State health officials confirmed some 91 cases of Legionnaires\u2019 disease, including 12 deaths. However, the illness has not been conclusively tied to the tainted water, although the cases spiked after the city switched its water source.\n\nThe water crisis was only acknowledged by Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder and state health and environmental officials in September 2015. Several state and local officials have since been criminally indicted in the fallout for the gross negligence and willful disregard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLead, as the Free Press notes, can damage the nervous system of the still-developing, vulnerable fetus. Exposure can cause miscarriages and stillbirths. Men and women can also be left infertile as a result of exposure.\n\nFrom the Free Press:\n\nThere is no safe level of lead in the body, but the impacts of lead are considered most severe on the developing brains and nervous systems of children and fetuses. It can lead to lower intelligence, behavioral problems and diminished life achievement, according to researchers. And the damage is irreversible; it cannot be undone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the study, Flint\u2019s birth and fetal death data were compared with that of 15 other larger Michigan cities, including Detroit.

Jordan. The exploits of the movie\u2019s title hero (Chadwick Boseman) and various members of his team are also throughly, lovingly captured by director and co-writer Ryan Coogler. But something does happen whenever the movie cuts over to Jordan\u2019s Erik \u201cKillmonger\u201d Stevens: The scenes snap Coogler, and by extension his audience, out of the usual Marvel Cinematic Universe reverie of affection and amusement, bringing them to sharper attention.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis may be unique to an MCU project, but it\u2019s not that unusual for Coogler\u2019s films, in part because he\u2019s a terrific filmmaker, and maybe also because all three of them\u2014Black Panther, Creed, and Fruitvale Station\u2014feature Jordan. It\u2019s not just a case of the camera loving Jordan, though he does have some of that innate star quality. Coogler seems especially fascinated by the actor\u2019s confidence\u2014his lack of obvious attempts to ingratiate himself\u2014and how that can transform the material he\u2019s given.\n\nAnd Jordan does help transform his material. None of his movies with Coogler are exactly unpredictable in terms of pure plot. This is even true of the groundbreaking Black Panther. On paper, Jordan\u2019s Erik follows an arc familiar to the MCU: He shares a semi-secret history with the film\u2019s costumed protagonist, spends his early scenes isolated from the other main characters as he gathers his resources and prepares to surprise the hero, and is pitted against that hero in a battle in which he functions as a mirror image, even donning his own panther-like supersuit.\n\nYet by handing this Marvel boilerplate over to Jordan, Coogler turns a well-worn structure into an affecting strategy. Erik\u2019s backstory, revealed well into the film, depends on his being left behind by the futuristic but closed-off country of Wakanda, abandoned in Coogler\u2019s hometown of Oakland following the death of his revolutionary father. He\u2019s one of the weightiest MCU villains, but Jordan doesn\u2019t charge straight into operatic intensity or even normal scenery-chewing. While most of the Wakanda characters speak in African-accented English that sounds regal and precise, Erik has a more colloquial American style, in which Jordan finds a wry musicality. His understated greeting of \u201cHey, auntie,\u201d directed at Wakandan royalty Ramonda (Angela Bassett), has a cultural specificity lacking from the MCU\u2019s easier laugh lines, and a human dimension sorely lacking from, say, the Red Skull. Jordan\u2019s performance depends on these small gestures, like when Erik addresses his Wakandan associates from the throne and taps his finger to betray a nervous energy behind his authority. Most supervillain performances play, with an understandable theatricality, to the audience. Jordan\u2019s speech patterns and little gestures are more self-possessed.\n\nPhoto: Black Panther (Marvel Studios/Disney)\n\nCoogler uses his gift for imagery to support Jordan\u2019s actorly choices, like the scene in which Erik approaches the Wakanda border with a crucial dead body in tow. This brief moment has a texture often lacking in comics movies, a kind of magic-hour idyll that nonetheless depicts an angry revolutionary carting around a corpse. Coogler also employs one of his favorite cinematic devices, the following shot, in which the camera pursues its subject. Killmonger isn\u2019t the only one who gets this treatment; Boseman\u2019s T\u2019Challa has one of his own as he approaches his crowning ceremony. But the most striking version in the movie stays on Killmonger\u2019s back, not Black Panther\u2019s. As Erik assumes the Wakandan throne, the camera begins upside down and makes a full, deliberate 180-degree turn, both a stylish image and a crystallization of the moment when Killmonger transitions from angry outsider to the man in charge.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJordan\u2019s willingness to be still, and explode with emotion when needed, seem to embolden Coogler\u2019s nervier instincts. This was the case before Black Panther, when Coogler made another franchise movie that gave him even more stylistic flexibility. Creed, in which Jordan plays the illegitimate son of Rocky Balboa\u2019s opponent-turned-buddy Apollo Creed, isn\u2019t building an expansion on an expensive, elaborate, ongoing piece of Marvel architecture, but working off of a series bible written mostly (and haphazardly) by Rocky star and screenwriter Sylvester Stallone. This allows Coogler and Jordan to reshape the material and make the best Rocky movie since the first one.\n\nCreed doesn\u2019t give Jordan a lot of dialogue upfront. Adonis Creed\u2019s first lines in the movie are spoken by an actor playing him as a kid, and he\u2019s first seen as an adult getting himself psyched up for a fight before the camera follows him up some stairs, mostly in shadow, and into the boxing ring. Other early scenes, all providing the character with degrees of standoffishness, rely on his seething intensity\u2014and accompanying sense of isolation. Even his first conversation with his love interest, Bianca (Tessa Thompson), gets abruptly curtailed as she slams a door in his face.\n\nIt\u2019s a neat, subtle trick Coogler plays to maintain Creed\u2019s underdog status despite what appears to be a more privileged background than Balboa. The fact that Jordan\u2019s ultra-persistent Creed doesn\u2019t replicate the aw-shucks humility of Rocky counts as a bold gambit in a big-studio environment that demands selfless gestures, cardboard villains, children in peril\u2026 anything to score some more precious likability. Creed works so well because Jordan spends so little time asking for approval, which gives his late-movie mid-fight admission to Balboa, that he\u2019s fighting to prove that he\u2019s not a \u201cmistake,\u201d the force of a major body blow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite Creed\u2019s boxing legacy, the movie succeeds in keeping its characters at ground level, which Coogler emphasizes with more following shots. Some of them have a traditional boxer-into-the-ring iconic grandeur, while others, like Creed\u2019s entrance into Bianca\u2019s apartment, are more intimate, bringing the audience along with the character rather than staring in awe at his majesty. There\u2019s a similar sense of intimacy in the sequence when Coogler follows Jordan and Stallone together from a Philadelphia street, up some stairs, and around the floor of a boxing gym, simply because after a lot of scenes that isolate Jordan, the two stars share the frame for nearly the entire length of the unbroken shot.\n\nAlthough both Creed and Panther have a broader visual vocabulary, it\u2019s their following shots that forge the strongest visual connections between the earliest, least flashy Coogler/Jordan collaboration. Fruitvale Station, a dramatization of the 24 hours leading up to the real-life police shooting of Oscar Grant III, an unarmed Bay Area resident, packs a clear emotional punch, and its relevance sadly hasn\u2019t faded at all since its 2013 release. In the context of Coogler\u2019s career, though, it feels like an extremely promising tryout. Plenty of filmmakers\u2014hopefully most\u2014improve after their first film, but it\u2019s rare to find a director who can follow a Sundance indie with two straight franchise movies and have the franchise movies feel more personal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Fruitvale, Coogler and Jordan haven\u2019t come to experiment or dazzle. Stylewise, the movie stays within contemporary American indie aesthetics, with lots of handheld camera and plainspoken realism (sort of Gus Van Sant lite). Jordan talks more, with a slightly Casey Affleck-ish rasp, and spells out more of his character\u2019s feelings. Most of the movie\u2019s stylistic flourishes are accordingly less sustained, part of its slice-of-life approach: Coogler\u2019s camera follows Oscar into his bedroom as he hastily cleans up and grabs some marijuana that he intends to sell; down the greeting card aisle of a store; and with handheld jitteriness as he approaches the canine victim of a hit-and-run.\n\nBut there are also distinctive if still unshowy stretches: one following shot of Oscar as he walks through his daughter\u2019s school, leading seamlessly into a brief scene with his daughter on the school\u2019s backyard playground, and another that travels with him and his friends up the escalator out of the BART system and onto the streets of San Francisco. The camera isn\u2019t constantly at Jordan\u2019s back but it scarcely lets him out of its sight\u2014a queasily effective strategy given Oscar\u2019s tragic end.\n\nThat coiled quality of waiting for a vicious inevitability lies more with the story of Fruitvale than Jordan\u2019s performance; the real-life events take over and can\u2019t provide the emotional release of an extremely fictional crowd-pleaser like Black Panther or Creed. But Jordan does get to show tremendous range of the everyday-life variety: warmth with his daughter, frustration with his limited job options, guilt over lying to his mom about using a cellphone earpiece while he drives, sly charm in a scene where he talks a shop owner into letting a couple of women in to use the bathroom. That this character\u2019s reality extends to a terrifying and violent police stop makes the movie chilling, and Jordan keeps it from feeling too much like a pure exercise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJordan is in almost every single scene of Fruitvale, most of the scenes in Creed, and comparatively fewer in Black Panther. This progression would make it seem like Coogler is weaning himself off of his muse, if not for the fact that Jordan\u2019s potency only increases as their collaboration goes on. He commands the screen in Fruitvale, emerges as a real movie star in Creed, and by Black Panther does so much with his half hour or so of screen time that his presence looms over the whole movie despite barely appearing in it for the first hour.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven in the single most affecting scene of Black Panther, Coogler holds back his star, trusting him to deliver in small doses. During a dream sequence, Erik speaks to his departed father (Sterling K. Brown), and in a single cut, Coogler brings Erik back to the pre-teen age he was when his dad was killed. Their interaction continues without missing a beat, and when he cuts back to the adult Erik, still in the dream, a tear streaming down Jordan\u2019s cheek, the scared, angry kid of seconds earlier is still there in Jordan\u2019s eyes. Inserting a kid actor into the scene could come off like a filmmaking shortcut, a way to wring emotion out of the scene faster. But it works beautifully because Coogler trusts Jordan to create continuity with those shots of his character\u2019s younger self. The scene has a recognizably real-world sense of tragedy with few, if any, equals in the MCU.\n\nThis carries over into the film\u2019s action climax. As they fight for Wakanda\u2019s fate, Erik and T\u2019Challa are forcefully separated by a vibranium-powered subway that temporarily de-powers their supersuits (Star Wars diehards may recall a similar physical setup in a Phantom Menace duel). Coogler uses the strategic halt in action as an opportunity for Erik to expose his pain, his sense that the world has taken everything from him, an outburst not unlike Creed\u2019s moment of ringside catharsis. Excitingly staged fisticuffs pause for sustained heartbreak. Black Panther has some Marvel limitations, but Coogler seems excited to readjust pop touchstones while pushing Jordan to the fore.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJordan and Coogler are both extremely talented, and will doubtlessly do great work apart. (A fourth collaboration between the two, the test-cheating drama Wrong Answer, has already been announced). Their work together so far, though, feels emboldened like the best star/filmmaker collaborations. In this case, Jordan and Coogler have been able to address aspects of being black in America in all of their movies in pretty disparate genres. Other filmmakers have treated Jordan like a more traditional star. In his movies without Coogler, including two other superhero pictures from now-disgraced director Josh Trank (the found-footage Chronicle and the most recent attempt at rebooting Fantastic Four), he\u2019s still charismatic. But his material leans heavily on that charisma, rather than pushing it beyond movie-star likability. Chronicle seems to at least understand his magnetism, but Fantastic Four strands him and the rest of the cast, while his single foray into comedy, That Awkward Moment, burdens him with the movie\u2019s most serious subplot (though he\u2019s not any worse off than the cast members who have to labor under the impression that their antics are amusing).\n\nAs Jordan becomes more famous, presumably other filmmakers will figure out how to use him more effectively and consistently. But right now it\u2019s hard to imagine another director matching the thrill of Coogler and Jordan getting on each other\u2019s wavelength, modulating big stylistic leaps with subtler performance notes (and, when necessary, vice versa), digging beyond the surface pleasures of their talents. Their collective gravity brings even the biggest movies down to earth.", "keywords": ["michael", "partnership", "erik", "jordan", "coogler", "jordans", "scene", "panther", "ryan", "black", "movie", "movies", "b", "gameraising", "goes", "creed"], "polarity": 0.09555645743145742, "subjectivity": 0.4853012265512266},

We know the science; we know what lead does. It\u2019s an irreversible neurotoxin. There\u2019s huge environmental injustices already with lead. Our country\u2019s most vulnerable children already have higher rates of lead exposure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cLead poisoning impacts a child\u2019s entire future. Their entire life course trajectory ... it impacts how they think, how they act, their behavior,\u201d she added. \u201cWhen I heard the possibility that there was lead in the water, it was a call to action. It was my professional, moral and ethical responsibility to figure out what was going on in our children.\u201d\n\nHanna-Attisha immediately went to work and analyzed data on 2,000 pediatric patients before and after the switch. Her research found that the percentage of children with elevated levels of lead in their blood had almost doubled since the switch, and in some neighborhoods, it had even tripled.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cContrary to what was happening across our nation\u2014where the percentage of children with elevated lead levels had been decreasing because we got lead out of paint and out of gasoline\u2014every year in the nation, in our state and even in our city, the percentage of children with elevated lead levels was going down,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe did a very simple study and looked to see what was happening to lead levels in Flint. We saw that the kids with elevated actually increased with the water switch, and it directly correlated with where the water lead levels were the worst,\u201d Hanna-Attisha explained. \u201cWhere the water lead levels were the highest, we saw the greatest increase in children\u2019s blood lead levels.\u201d\n\nThat research was done in 2015 at \u201crecord speed,\u201d she said.\n\nBecause Hanna-Attisha knew this was a public health emergency, she decided to go public with her findings. Initially, state government officials tried to discount her research and undermine her credibility. The public outcry and national media attention that was generated by her findings forced the state to re-evaluate its data, however, and both Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder and then-President Barack Obama declared a state of emergency for the area.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHanna-Attisha said that although research results are not normally shared at a press conference, she felt that she had no choice because the families of Flint needed and deserved to know what was going on. She released her findings at a press conference in September 2015.\n\n\u201cLead impacts everybody. It impacts every organ system and every age group, including pets,\u201d she said. \u201cWe worry the most about children, especially those under the age of 6 because that\u2019s when their brains are developing. That\u2019s when their nervous system is developing, and lead most potently is a neurotoxin.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince then, Hanna-Attisha has remained at the forefront of efforts to change public health policy on both the local and national levels, and to meet the needs of children and families who are being impacted by exposure to lead. In 2016 she became director of the newly created Pediatric Public Health Initiative, which is an interdisciplinary collaborative effort between Michigan State University and Hurley Children\u2019s Hospital. The program will provide tools, resources and interventions for improving the health and development of children affected by lead exposure, and it will monitor those children and their families for years to come to assess the effectiveness of those interventions.\n\n\u201cWith PPHI, we are actively trying to flip the story for our kids,\u201d Hanna-Attisha said. \u201cWe are doing work that hasn\u2019t been done before. We very much know what lead does\u2014that science is there. We know what it does to cognition, to behavior, to criminality and to life outcomes, and leaning on the field of developmental neuroscience, we are proactively intervening to preserve the tomorrows of our children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEveryone in Flint\u2014community partners, moms, kids, nonprofits\u2014is rolling up their sleeves to make sure that our kids turn out OK, and really better than OK,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have been able to establish free, year-round child care. We are the only city to have universal preschool. We have Medicaid expansion, we have mobile grocery stores, we have breast-feeding services, mental-health support and positive parenting programs.\n\n\u201cMy kids in Flint continue to be the inspiration for this work,\u201d Hanna-Attisha continued. \u201cThey did absolutely nothing wrong other than to live in an almost bankrupt city that was under state emergency management, where the focus was cutting costs rather than children\u2019s health. As a pediatrician, it\u2019s my job to be an advocate for my patients, to protect and speak up for kids, because they can\u2019t. That\u2019s the privilege and honor of what I do every day.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo that end, Hanna-Attisha is coordinating the establishment of a registry that will track the children of Flint who have been exposed to lead. She was appointed to the 15-member Child Lead Exposure Elimination Commission, which has recommended the mandatory testing of all children for lead poisoning, expanded home-testing requirements and the creation of a statewide database of structures with dangerous lead levels.\n\nHanna-Attisha considers the Heinz Family Foundation award to be a huge honor.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s humbling and it\u2019s an incredible honor to receive this award. It\u2019s prestigious in academics, and it means so much to me because one of the first people to receive this award was a pediatrician named Herb Needleman,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis was a pediatrician who spent his whole life and his whole career on lead,\u201d she explained. \u201cHe was one of the first people to tell us that low levels of lead impact children. He spent much of his career being attacked by the lead industry, but he remained resilient and fought back for children.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cI think it means so much to me because I couldn\u2019t do the work I do without incredible mentors and giants in the field, and he was definitely one of these amazing giants, and my work is possible by being able to stand on the shoulders of him and many others like him.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHanna-Attisha also believes that the award is an excellent way to remind people that the crisis in Flint is ongoing. More than three years after it first began, the people of Flint still do not have clean water in their faucets.\n\nThe Heinz Awards were established to honor the memory of U.S. Sen. John Heinz. The awards have recognized 133 individuals and awarded more than $26 million to its honorees.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe are honored to present this year\u2019s public policy award to Dr. Hanna-Attisha, who in her fight to protect the children and families of Flint has embodied the qualities of courage, wisdom, compassion and grit,\u201d Teresa Heinz, chairman of the Heinz Family Foundation, said. \u201cHer unrelenting effort as a champion for truth, her continued advocacy work on behalf of those who will suffer the effects of lead exposure for years to come, and her commitment to making unsafe drinking water an issue of our nation, exemplify the tremendous impact that one citizen activist can have on our world.\u201d\n\nFor more information about Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha and other Heinz awardees, visit the foundation website.", "keywords": ["foundation", "heinz", "levels", "pediatrician", "public", "national", "lead", "water", "michs", "children", "hannaattisha", "award", "state", "family", "leadcontaminated", "honors", "flint"], "polarity": 0.14733458177278408, "subjectivity": 0.43607187444266093},

And on his HBO show Friday night, Maher exploited the brutal slayings of Terence Crutcher and Walter Scott in an effort to get Cornel West to agree with him.\n\nAs previously reported by The Root, on May 17 a jury found Tulsa, Okla., Police Officer Betty Shelby not guilty of manslaughter in Crutcher\u2019s death. The first murder trial for Michael Slager, the South carolina police officer who fatally shot Scott in the back, ended in mistrial in December because of a hung jury. Earlier this month, Slager pleaded guilty to violating Scott\u2019s civil rights in exchange for the prosecution dropping the murder charge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFatally shooting someone in the back while he\u2019s running away, or fatally shooting someone multiple times while he\u2019s walking away with his hands up, certainly qualifies as a civil and human rights violation. These acts of state violence should also have qualified for murder convictions, but America.\n\n\n\nFriday night on Real Time, Maher used Crutcher\u2019s and Scott\u2019s black bodies\u2014and all black people shot down by police\u2014as political props. He used their black lives as ledes and their slayings as segues into what he really wanted to do: Put their blood on West\u2019s hands and on anyone\u2019s who was critical of or didn\u2019t vote for Clinton.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhite liberalism in high definition.\n\nThough West tried to redirect the conversation back to the fact that, once again, police officers were given \u201cKill-a-Black Person\u201d passes in a court of law, Maher was not trying to be distracted from what he felt was important:\n\n\n\nI know this is a matter close to your heart. There was an acquittal this week of a police officer, Betty Jo Shelby from Tulsa. She shot Terence Crutcher, an unarmed black man. She said she feared for her life, and then in South Carolina, Michael Slager shot Walter Scott in his back, and that was a mistrial. And this argument that the cops get away with, \u201cI was fearful that they might do something erratic,\u201d I thought when you went into the police department that you understood there was some danger in this job. I don\u2019t know where they got this idea that if I fear at all, I am allowed to shoot you. And by the way, Trump is all for it and Hillary Clinton wouldn\u2019t have been. So, as someone who said they were equally awful ...\n\nAfter a few words in response, West tried to recenter the conversation on victims of state-sanctioned violence, the U.S. injustice system, and how intrinsically capitalism and racism are linked:\n\nLet\u2019s keep the focus where it belongs: The police have yet to go to jail when they end up committing violence and murdering these young black brothers and sisters. And the problem is, we want a fair trial for them, but there\u2019s a chronic racism that\u2019s shot through, but it\u2019s just not the police. Same is true on Wall Street, no Wall Street executives go to jail, either. Rule of law comes down hard on the poor, the well-to-do get off, or the police get off because they\u2019re protecting the profit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe entire time West was speaking, Maher was like a child playing double Dutch, anxious, excited and determined, just waiting for his chance to jump in.\n\n\u201cRight ... but Hillary ... but ... I know, but ... ,\u201d he tried to interject, but it was never the right spin of the rope.\n\nOnce West finished speaking, Maher brought it all back to Clinton and Trump, showing more excitement and passion when speaking about those two than he ever did in the 47 seconds he spent talking about police brutality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnfortunately, West took the bait, and the two men ended up having a fiery debate about Bernie Sanders, Clinton and Trump, when a discussion of white supremacists in badges\u2014and the criminal system that protects them\u2014is what the moment called for.\n\nWatch the clip below:\n\nI\u2019m trying to remember the episode of Real Time dedicated to discussing police violence, discriminatory policing, the Movement for Black Lives or why a financial divestment from police departments\u2014that reroutes funds to the occupied and systemically oppressed communities they pretend to protect\u2014is necessary, but I\u2019m drawing a blank.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, Maher has proved he\u2019s this guy before. This is, after all, the same man who spends so much time criticizing Trump while making heart eyes at Ann Coulter, an unadulterated bigot who made a name for herself being as repulsive and racist as humanly possible. This is also the man who called Black Lives Matter activists \u201cfucking idiots\u201d for criticizing Hillary Clinton.\n\nWhite liberals have mastered concern of convenience, though. When caring about black people, Latinx people, indigenous people or poor people seems to be in their best political interest, the tears are continuous. But when the need for radical change is discussed, a radical change that does not include automatically defaulting to Clinton because \u201cshe\u2019s much better than Trump,\u201d then the same white liberals tell those same people not to be so demanding and impatient and \u201cideologically pure.\u201d They tell them not to let \u201cperfect be the enemy of the good.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaher said his most honest words in the beginning of the segment:\n\n\u201cI know this is a matter close to your heart ... ,\u201d Maher said to West.\n\nAt least he didn\u2019t pretend that it is close to his own.\n\nDear Mr. Maher: Next time you want to wallow in Clinton\u2019s loss, pretend to have some decency and don\u2019t exploit the police killings of black people to prove your point.

And on his HBO show Friday night, Maher exploited the brutal slayings of Terence Crutcher and Walter Scott in an effort to get Cornel West to agree with him.\n\nAs previously reported by The Root, on May 17 a jury found Tulsa, Okla., Police Officer Betty Shelby not guilty of manslaughter in Crutcher\u2019s death. The first murder trial for Michael Slager, the South carolina police officer who fatally shot Scott in the back, ended in mistrial in December because of a hung jury. Earlier this month, Slager pleaded guilty to violating Scott\u2019s civil rights in exchange for the prosecution dropping the murder charge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFatally shooting someone in the back while he\u2019s running away, or fatally shooting someone multiple times while he\u2019s walking away with his hands up, certainly qualifies as a civil and human rights violation. These acts of state violence should also have qualified for murder convictions, but America.\n\n\n\nFriday night on Real Time, Maher used Crutcher\u2019s and Scott\u2019s black bodies\u2014and all black people shot down by police\u2014as political props. He used their black lives as ledes and their slayings as segues into what he really wanted to do: Put their blood on West\u2019s hands and on anyone\u2019s who was critical of or didn\u2019t vote for Clinton.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhite liberalism in high definition.\n\nThough West tried to redirect the conversation back to the fact that, once again, police officers were given \u201cKill-a-Black Person\u201d passes in a court of law, Maher was not trying to be distracted from what he felt was important:\n\n\n\nI know this is a matter close to your heart. There was an acquittal this week of a police officer, Betty Jo Shelby from Tulsa. She shot Terence Crutcher, an unarmed black man. She said she feared for her life, and then in South Carolina, Michael Slager shot Walter Scott in his back, and that was a mistrial. And this argument that the cops get away with, \u201cI was fearful that they might do something erratic,\u201d I thought when you went into the police department that you understood there was some danger in this job. I don\u2019t know where they got this idea that if I fear at all, I am allowed to shoot you. And by the way, Trump is all for it and Hillary Clinton wouldn\u2019t have been. So, as someone who said they were equally awful ...\n\nAfter a few words in response, West tried to recenter the conversation on victims of state-sanctioned violence, the U.S. injustice system, and how intrinsically capitalism and racism are linked:\n\nLet\u2019s keep the focus where it belongs: The police have yet to go to jail when they end up committing violence and murdering these young black brothers and sisters. And the problem is, we want a fair trial for them, but there\u2019s a chronic racism that\u2019s shot through, but it\u2019s just not the police. Same is true on Wall Street, no Wall Street executives go to jail, either. Rule of law comes down hard on the poor, the well-to-do get off, or the police get off because they\u2019re protecting the profit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe entire time West was speaking, Maher was like a child playing double Dutch, anxious, excited and determined, just waiting for his chance to jump in.\n\n\u201cRight ... but Hillary ... but ... I know, but ... ,\u201d he tried to interject, but it was never the right spin of the rope.\n\nOnce West finished speaking, Maher brought it all back to Clinton and Trump, showing more excitement and passion when speaking about those two than he ever did in the 47 seconds he spent talking about police brutality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnfortunately, West took the bait, and the two men ended up having a fiery debate about Bernie Sanders, Clinton and Trump, when a discussion of white supremacists in badges\u2014and the criminal system that protects them\u2014is what the moment called for.\n\nWatch the clip below:\n\nI\u2019m trying to remember the episode of Real Time dedicated to discussing police violence, discriminatory policing, the Movement for Black Lives or why a financial divestment from police departments\u2014that reroutes funds to the occupied and systemically oppressed communities they pretend to protect\u2014is necessary, but I\u2019m drawing a blank.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, Maher has proved he\u2019s this guy before. This is, after all, the same man who spends so much time criticizing Trump while making heart eyes at Ann Coulter, an unadulterated bigot who made a name for herself being as repulsive and racist as humanly possible. This is also the man who called Black Lives Matter activists \u201cfucking idiots\u201d for criticizing Hillary Clinton.\n\nWhite liberals have mastered concern of convenience, though. When caring about black people, Latinx people, indigenous people or poor people seems to be in their best political interest, the tears are continuous. But when the need for radical change is discussed, a radical change that does not include automatically defaulting to Clinton because \u201cshe\u2019s much better than Trump,\u201d then the same white liberals tell those same people not to be so demanding and impatient and \u201cideologically pure.\u201d They tell them not to let \u201cperfect be the enemy of the good.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaher said his most honest words in the beginning of the segment:\n\n\u201cI know this is a matter close to your heart ... ,\u201d Maher said to West.\n\nAt least he didn\u2019t pretend that it is close to his own.\n\nDear Mr. Maher: Next time you want to wallow in Clinton\u2019s loss, pretend to have some decency and don\u2019t exploit the police killings of black people to prove your point. Because\u2014and this may come as a shock\u2014police officers continue to kill with impunity regardless of which party or person occupies the Oval Office.", "keywords": ["maher", "clinton", "know", "liberalism", "killing", "violence", "trump", "score", "political", "hd", "white", "west", "away", "hillary", "watch", "black", "shot", "points"], "polarity": 0.017155287817938413, "subjectivity": 0.4326582520558424},

I teach at a university less than an hour from Tulsa. Much of the trial happened during my finals week, so I made the trip to Tulsa so I could see Betty Shelby in person. I was able to get into the courthouse because I work in ministry in Oklahoma City, but really, I went because something inside me needed to lay eyes on her for myself. What I saw was unimpressive.\n\n\n\nShe was dressed in a simple business suit and had what appeared to be a bemused grin on her face. She impatiently slumped as she walked to the courtroom\u2014almost as if she had been inconvenienced by the death of this black man. Looking at Shelby, I was reminded of Mark Richert, the police officer who called Terence Crutcher a \u201cbad dude,\u201d and of what Betty Shelby\u2019s husband, David, said on 60 Minutes a few weeks earlier: that there were two victims that night in September.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSomehow, she saw herself as a victim.\n\nLater that week, my iPhone text message alert pinged: \u201cNot Guilty.\u201d\n\nDamn.\n\nBack in September, Crutcher, an unarmed black man, was walking to his car with his hands up when he was shot by Tulsa Police Officer Betty Shelby. This incident was captured on video by both a police dashboard camera and an aerial video from a police helicopter in which Richert, a fellow officer who was overlooking the scene, profiled Crutcher and called him a bad dude.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShelby went on 60 Minutes last month to tell her side of the story; she said that Crutcher \u201ccaused his own death\u201d by \u201cfailing to comply\u201d with her orders. She insisted that race had nothing to do with her shooting and killing an unarmed man. With tears in her eyes, Shelby had the audacity to say that she felt as if a \u201clynch mob is after her.\u201d\n\nEach time these kinds of cases go before legal authorities, I do something illogical, something I\u2019ve tried very hard to stop: I have hope.\n\n\n\nHope that they will see what I see and rule in a way that aligns with justice. Hope that the families will find a measure of peace despite suffering an incalculable loss. Hope that the vicious legacy of violence against black bodies will come to an end.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI keep expecting the moral arc of the universe to finally start bending toward justice. I want Martin Luther King Jr. to be right in his belief that things will, eventually, get better, but now I am beginning to think that he may have been wrong.\n\n\n\nI find it amazing how police officers find a way to reason with and subdue white offenders without killing them, but black men and women in far less confrontational encounters consistently end up dead.\n\n\n\nRecently, NPR released a story on its podcast Embedded about a police shooting that could have, and perhaps should have, happened\u2014but did not. That perpetrator was verbally threatening and running toward a police officer with his hands in his pocket, but the police found a way to use restraint. Of course, the suspect was white.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCrutcher had his hands up while walking away from the officers and, as his sister informed us on 60 Minutes, was most likely putting his hands on the car as he had been taught to do by his father when interacting with the police. And yet he was killed \u2026 and his killer was found not guilty.\n\n\n\nMaya Angelou once said that when people show you who they are, believe them the first time.\n\n\n\nThe same is true of institutions.\n\n\n\nI need to stop putting hope in a system that was never designed to protect people who look like me. This country taught me what to expect in this case by what happened in the cases of Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Freddie Gray, Tamir Rice, Rekia Boyd and Keith Lamont Scott. I should have known that black lives don\u2019t matter in America, and that police officers can kill us on camera and then go home to their families feeling vindicated.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA murderer was found not guilty of the lesser charge of manslaughter in the death of Terence Crutcher, and I was a fool to hope for anything resembling justice in this case. Betty Shelby is the physical embodiment of Darth Susan, and what\u2019s worse, she was found innocent because she had a jury of her peers.", "keywords": ["killer", "cop", "hands", "man", "crutcher", "guilty", "killing", "hope", "ive", "way", "unarmed", "betty", "shelby", "black", "officers", "seen", "officer", "tulsa"], "polarity": 0.003945972328325278, "subjectivity": 0.4759453781512605},

At this point, I think it\u2019s safe to say that we not only want to go to Wakanda, we want to live there. Who wouldn\u2019t?\n\nBut if there\u2019s one gripe we have with our cinematic utopia, it\u2019s that outside of the typical T-shirts and action-figure merch, the brilliant minds at Marvel seem to have underestimated how much we\u2019d want to inhabit this world\u2014starting with our closets. Costume designer Ruth E. Carter\u2019s glorious design work was not only gorgeous but wearable, and while Marvel\u2019s \u201cWelcome to Wakanda\u201d presentation during New York Fashion Week gave us a taste of how some of those styles might translate into the real world, it ultimately just left us starving for more.\n\nPhoto: Jamie McCarthy (Getty Images)\n\nWhile those styles were fly, they were only vaguely evocative of what we saw on the big screen. With that in mind, we\u2019ve put our heads together to create our own silver-screen-to-street-slay lookbook [Editor\u2019s note: Watch out for spoilers!], inspired by our favorite looks. Let\u2019s get into it, starting with everyone\u2019s favorite prodigy, Shuri:\n\nPhoto: Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe love, love, loved Shuri\u2019s super-accessible but luxe athletic-inspired style. While it was too sophisticated to call \u201cathleisure,\u201d it definitely gave us the kind of sporty, futuristic chic we bet is all the rage in Wakanda. I loved the modernist neoprene and reworked sweatshirt stylings\u2014not to mention her incredible white lab dress, which I have a feeling will inspire more than a few minimalist wedding gowns\u2014but The Glow Up Editor Veronica Webb fell hard for her more ceremonial looks:\n\n\n\nThe princess of Wakanda coronation-ceremony corset crushed it with Maasai-style beadwork, and the gold-plated alligator \u201cjaw grill\u201d took gold fronts to a whole new level. Corset-style bustiers worn over tees and button-down shirts are an \u201980s-inspired trend I predict will now go Wakandan with beaded prints in active wear and beaded body-cage necklaces showing up on both runways and in shop windows.\n\nIf you\u2019re a fan of Shuri\u2019s sporty-chic style, look no further than the sleek and saturated silhouettes of Chromat, though I also spotted plenty of Shuri-worthy styles in the latest activewear collection by online retailer ASOS.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Left and right: Noam Galai (Getty Images for Chromat), center: Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nNow onto Nakia (Lupita Nyong\u2019o): I personally swooned over the one-shouldered, green wax-print jumpsuit she wore while walking through Step Town with T\u2019Challa. Needless to say, sundresses aren\u2019t the only thing I\u2019ll be rocking this summer, and I headed right over to online African marketplace Zuvaa on Afrikrea to score some Nakia street style.\n\nFor Veronica Webb, it was all about the nightlife:\n\nThe green halter-neck dress worn in the Korean casino? Now, that\u2019s literally how you slay. As daring as the slit-to-there dress looked on her beyond-perfect toned and glowing body, this silhouette actually looks good on all body types. Proms and summer garden parties get ready: Wakanda is coming in force.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLaQuan Smith and Xuly B\u00ebt both nailed Nakia\u2019s rather-be-seen-in-green style in their Fall/Winter 2018 collections:\n\nPhoto: Left to right: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images), Marvel Studios/Disney, Noam Galai (Getty Images)\n\nBut costume designer Carter brought Black Panther\u2019s male leads through in style, too. If you\u2019re a tech-savvy traditionalist, like T\u2019Challa (Chadwick Boseman), you can actually cop the T\u2019Challa tunic from Afrikrea, closely modeled after the fitted black embroidered jacket he first wore on the throne. A riff on his purple-embroidered vest is available as a tunic from the site as well.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nBut if Killmonger\u2019s (Michael B. Jordan) rough and rugged all-American look is more your style, look no further than American unisex-friendly brands Levi\u2019s, Wrangler and Pyer Moss, who nailed our legacy in American style with its \u201cAmerican Also\u201d collection during New York Fashion Week.\n\nVeronica Webb also predicts that we\u2019ll see a lot more scarification as a trend in body art. She says this is \u201critual body art at its best. I think we might see these turning up as a choice in piercing studios and as a choice for Greeks over traditional frat branding.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images), Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nVeronica thinks we\u2019ll being seeing a lot more skull art, too, as seen on Danai Gurira as General Okoye. She\u2019s envisioning long-wear temporary skull tattoos for the sultry days of summer.\n\nOn that note, let\u2019s talk about Okoye out of uniform: Gorgeous! I was coveting her plaid trench during the interrogation scene, and Veronica and I were both gagging over her little black dress in the final scene (we know you stayed for the credits, didn\u2019t you?).

Some even said that this is a unique opportunity to forgive Shelby, and, thereby, show the love of Jesus Christ. Many of them went so far as to ask what would Jesus do when faced with these circumstances. Their assumption is that Jesus would calmly be comfortable with injustice. I disagree. Many Christians find themselves lost when they are confronted with injustice. They assume that God wants them to be passive and overly spiritual when staring in the face of evil; yet, when I look at the story of Jesus, I see 10 things we can all do in response to injustices like the Shelby verdict that Jesus would, unquestionably, be comfortable with.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1: Drink Alcohol\n\nBecause, after all Jesus did turn water into wine in John 2: 1-11. I need some spirits to soothe my soul\u2014and I\u2019m not talking about any holy ones.\n\n2: Curse\n\nIn Matthew 21: 18-22, Jesus curses a fig tree. I can curse all I want in response to this Darth Susan getting off. It\u2019s better I get it out than hold it inside. After all, as my Jesuit seminary professor taught me, cursing is spiritual catharsis\u2014it cleanses the soul.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3: Riot\n\nJesus was wilding in the temple in John 2:15. He pulled out whips and was beating niggas\u2019s asses. His motivation was the injustice he saw in the temple. I can riot in response to similar injustice in the streets.\n\n4: Fight\n\nAs the above shows, Jesus was not above laying hands. In fact, in Matthew 10:34, he said, \u201cThink not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTranslation: Punks that jump up can get beat down\u2014in Jesus name.\n\n5: Mourn\n\nToo many black folks think that being a Christian means that we have to be quick to forgive. Jesus does not say this. In fact, in Romans 12:15, the Bible says we are to, \u201cweep with those who weep.\u201d That is, empathy is important. If we are callous to the suffering of others, then we need to reexamine our relationship with God. Further, it is important to not tell people how to mourn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6: Cry\n\nBecause John 11: 35, \u201cJesus Wept,\u201d is the verse everyone knows.\n\n7: Sit alone in silence\n\nIn Luke 5: 15-16, Jesus withdrew to be alone. Sometimes, we do not know what so Say, Jesus modeled for us how to be alone and tarry with difficulties.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8: Express anger\n\nJesus would be comfortable with anger. In fact, in Ephesians 4: 26, the Bible says Be ye angry, and sin not. Anger is an appropriate response to injustice.\n\n9: Say that Black Lives Matter\n\nIn Matthew 25:31-46, Jesus tells the stories of sheep and goats. It\u2019s a metaphor for his followers who have concern for others and those who do not. When the goats say, \u201c\u2018Lord, when did we see You hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not care for You?\u201d He responds by saying, \u201cinasmuch as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to Me.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack folks in this country have, consistently, been the \u2018least of these.\u2019 From decrepit schools to the new Jim Crow, we are the left out and the forgotten in America\u2019s democratic experiment. I have no doubt that Jesus would boldly declare, in response to these injustices, that Black Lives Matter. If you have beef with that declaration, your problem is not with me, it\u2019s with Jesus.\n\n10: Pray\n\nBecause once I\u2019ve prayed with my hands and my feet, I should certainly pray with my heart\u2014but it will not be for their forgiveness. It\u2019ll be that I don\u2019t whip their ass.\n\n", "keywords": ["jesus", "say", "need", "hands", "crutcher", "injustice", "isnt", "fury", "matthew", "christian", "way", "terence", "response", "shelby", "respond", "black", "john", "murder", "forgiveness"], "polarity": 0.040788567493112944, "subjectivity": 0.48257083825265634},

I teach at a university less than an hour from Tulsa. Much of the trial happened during my finals week, so I made the trip to Tulsa so I could see Betty Shelby in person. I was able to get into the courthouse because I work in ministry in Oklahoma City, but really, I went because something inside me needed to lay eyes on her for myself. What I saw was unimpressive.\n\n\n\nShe was dressed in a simple business suit and had what appeared to be a bemused grin on her face. She impatiently slumped as she walked to the courtroom\u2014almost as if she had been inconvenienced by the death of this black man. Looking at Shelby, I was reminded of Mark Richert, the police officer who called Terence Crutcher a \u201cbad dude,\u201d and of what Betty Shelby\u2019s husband, David, said on 60 Minutes a few weeks earlier: that there were two victims that night in September.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSomehow, she saw herself as a victim.\n\nLater that week, my iPhone text message alert pinged: \u201cNot Guilty.\u201d\n\nDamn.\n\nBack in September, Crutcher, an unarmed black man, was walking to his car with his hands up when he was shot by Tulsa Police Officer Betty Shelby. This incident was captured on video by both a police dashboard camera and an aerial video from a police helicopter in which Richert, a fellow officer who was overlooking the scene, profiled Crutcher and called him a bad dude.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShelby went on 60 Minutes last month to tell her side of the story; she said that Crutcher \u201ccaused his own death\u201d by \u201cfailing to comply\u201d with her orders. She insisted that race had nothing to do with her shooting and killing an unarmed man. With tears in her eyes, Shelby had the audacity to say that she felt as if a \u201clynch mob is after her.\u201d\n\nEach time these kinds of cases go before legal authorities, I do something illogical, something I\u2019ve tried very hard to stop: I have hope.\n\n\n\nHope that they will see what I see and rule in a way that aligns with justice. Hope that the families will find a measure of peace despite suffering an incalculable loss. Hope that the vicious legacy of violence against black bodies will come to an end.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI keep expecting the moral arc of the universe to finally start bending toward justice. I want Martin Luther King Jr. to be right in his belief that things will, eventually, get better, but now I am beginning to think that he may have been wrong.\n\n\n\nI find it amazing how police officers find a way to reason with and subdue white offenders without killing them, but black men and women in far less confrontational encounters consistently end up dead.\n\n\n\nRecently, NPR released a story on its podcast Embedded about a police shooting that could have, and perhaps should have, happened\u2014but did not. That perpetrator was verbally threatening and running toward a police officer with his hands in his pocket, but the police found a way to use restraint. Of course, the suspect was white.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCrutcher had his hands up while walking away from the officers and, as his sister informed us on 60 Minutes, was most likely putting his hands on the car as he had been taught to do by his father when interacting with the police. And yet he was killed \u2026 and his killer was found not guilty.\n\n\n\nMaya Angelou once said that when people show you who they are, believe them the first time.\n\n\n\nThe same is true of institutions.\n\n\n\nI need to stop putting hope in a system that was never designed to protect people who look like me. This country taught me what to expect in this case by what happened in the cases of Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Freddie Gray, Tamir Rice, Rekia Boyd and Keith Lamont Scott. I should have known that black lives don\u2019t matter in America, and that police officers can kill us on camera and then go home to their families feeling vindicated.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA murderer was found not guilty of the lesser charge of manslaughter in the death of Terence Crutcher, and I was a fool to hope for anything resembling justice in this case.

This incident was caught on video by both a police dash cam and an aerial video from a police helicopter wherein an officer looking on the scene profiles Crutcher and calls him a \u2018bad dude.\u2019\n\nOn \"60 Minutes\" last night, Shelby said Crutcher \u201ccaused his own death\u201d by \u201cfailing to comply\u201d to her orders. She insisted that race had nothing to do with her shooting and killing an unarmed man. This was bad enough, but they were all things I\u2019ve heard before. What happened next convinced me that I was in the White supremacy Matrix.\n\nWith tears in her eyes, Shelby had the fucking audacity to say that she feels like a \u2018lynch mob is after her.\u2019 Thereafter, her husband, also a police officer, said that there were two victims that night in September: Crutcher and Shelby.\n\nSomehow this woman has found a way to talk herself into thinking she is a victim. She sat on national television and cried the Whitest of tears while expressing zero remorse for killing a man whom she thought had a gun, but, in fact, had one neither on his person nor in his car.\n\nWhen she talked about a lynch mob coming to get her, I had cognitive dissonance. I could not believe I was in Oklahoma listening to a White woman talk about how she was afraid of a lynch mob.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow could she, a White woman, say that shit as a police officer in a city where White folks were responsible for the destruction of Black Wall Street\u2014 the worst mass killing of Black people in American history. An incident that began on the night of May 31, 1921 and lasted only 14 hours resulted in 35 city blocks burned, 800 people injured and more than 300 people killed. The mass murder finally ended when Adjutant General Charles Barrett of the Oklahoma National Guard arrived with 109 soldiers and declared martial law\u2014but Darth Susan was sitting on my TV talking about how she was afraid of a lynch mob.\n\nThen I thought about Laura and LD Nelson. On the night of May 2, 1911, a four-man posse arrived at the Nelson home to search for stolen cows as Laura, her husband Austin, their 14-year-old son L.D., and 2-year-old daughter Carrie were sleeping in bed. Startled by the men who burst into their home, L.D. grabbed a rifle off the wall to defend his family, but as Laura tried to wrestle the firearm away, it discharged and fatally wounded Okfuskee Deputy Sheriff George Loney. On the morning of May 25, a lynch mob of 40 men arrived at the county jail and carried away L.D. and Laura. She was sexually assaulted, and then along with her son, lynched. As their Black bodies swung in the winds that came sweeping down the plains, the lynch mob posed for local photographer George Henry Farnum who captured an image that was later used on postcards. A district judge convened a grand jury, but no charges were filed because witnesses were unwilling to identity the 40 murderers\u2014but no.\n\nShe was talking about neither Black Wall Street nor the Lynching of Laura and LD Nelson. She did not see that her killing Crutcher participated in the legacy of white violence against black bodies in Oklahoma. She was concerned about her feelings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCrutcher reminded me of my uncle: a southern Black man who loved God, struggled with drug addiction and had a generous heart. She did not see him. She, like the police officer who was in the helicopter-circling overhead, saw a \u2018bad dude.\u2019 Or perhaps it was a \u2018bad guy\u2019\u2014like the kind she told her grand son to chase as he rode in a toy police car later in the interview, reminding me of the way that anti-Blackness and stereotypes are passed down generation to generation.\n\nI am constantly amazed by how police officers find a way to reason with and subdue white offenders without killing them, but Black men and women in far less confrontational encounters consistently end up dead.\n\nRecently, NPR released a story on their podcast Embedded about a police shooting that could have happened\u2014but did not. That perpetrator was threatening, running toward a police officer with his hands in his pocket, but the police used restraint. Of course, the suspect was White.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTerrence Crutcher had his hands up, was walking away from the officers, and, as his sister informed us, was most likely putting his hands on the car as he had been taught to do by his father when interacting with the police. It is sadly ironic that what his father taught him to do as a means to try to teach his son how to survive police encounters is what probably got him killed.\n\nNo. He was murdered.\n\nWhat amazes me is not that it happens, but that police officers continue to insist that race has nothing to do with it. The same way that a glitch in the game had nothing to do with why Bo Jackson kept breaking through tackles every time you play with him in Tecmo Super Bowl.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBetty Shelby is the worst type of Darth Susan.

But, Get Out is a lot less comforting, which is probably why it didn\u2019t win Best Picture last night.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s safety in distance. That\u2019s one of the things you realize when surveying creative work that touches on prejudice in American society. Recent Oscar-nominated films about the black experience like Malcolm X, 12 Years a Slave, or Selma have all had the buffer of decades or centuries. They still hold up a mirror that reflects a history of institutionalized racism but there\u2019s a thick layer of dust covering the reflected image, letting viewers say \u201cThat only kinda looks like us; things have gotten better.\u201d\n\nThe Shape of Water has that same dust on it. The period-piece stylings in Guillermo del Toro\u2019s movie are meant to invoke the timeframe when B-movie monster features were all the rage. That element also ties in neatly to the fact that blatant racism and sexism ran rampant during the Cold War era. Nothing about the movie\u2019s lush romanticism or softly lit happy ending makes the viewer think about the plight of society\u2019s outsiders in the present day.\n\nBecause it\u2019s in the here-and-now, Get Out doesn\u2019t offer the easy dodge of distance. Its central plot mechanic calls on a history of exploitation and injustice that\u2019s continuing to happen. Lured in by white people he thought he could trust, Chris gets treated like a resource: a body to be hollowed out and a soul to be discarded. Niceties are said about his talent but doors aren\u2019t opened; instead, the bidders at the Armitages\u2019 backyard auction want to possess Chris\u2019 skills for themselves rather than have him create his own successes.\n\nLook, I\u2019m glad that Get Out and The Shape of Water won their respective awards last night. It\u2019s not insignificant that The Shape of Water is the first genre movie to win Best Picture since 2004, but Peele\u2019s win for Best Original Screenplay feels like a safe consolation prize, something big enough to be meaningful but not heavy with the ultimate weight of Best Picture.

Rodriguez (Getty Images)\n\nWhen writer-director Jordan Peele won his Best Original Screenplay Oscar for 2017\u2019s biggest hit, Get Out, I cheered. When cast members of 2018\u2019s biggest hit so far, Marvel\u2019s Black Panther, walked the red carpet at the 90th Academy Awards, I swooned. And when I looked out at the sea of (mostly) white people attending the Oscars, I wondered, \u201cDid Hollywood learn anything over the past year?\u201d\n\n\n\nOn a budget of less than $5 million, Get Out made $255 million at the U.S. box office last year. Girls Trip, directed by Malcolm D. Lee, made more than $140 million in 2017. Black Panther is on pace to do $1 billion worth of business worldwide, reaching $900 million over this past weekend. Movie-theater owners know what\u2019s up: Films that are more diverse put up numbers. But does Hollywood know that?\n\nIn a show of amazing discipline, no one of note (so far) has written a story lately expressing shock that black movies are having a moment. Because, technically, this \u201cmoment\u201d has been a known thing since the \u201990s (Wesley Snipes\u2019 vehicle Blade made $415 million in 1998). Or at least since Tyler Perry took his chitlin circuit plays and made Madea mainstream with 2005\u2019s Diary of a Mad Black Woman. If a movie is good, or at least steeped in our cultures and traditions, someone will happily plunk down more than $10 to see the flick. And studies show that films with diverse casts make more money.\n\nBut you can know all of this, make all the money, get all the accolades and still have a career that never quite hits the stratosphere after an Academy Award, thanks to good ol\u2019 prejudice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHalle Berry is a bona fide star with an Oscar for her role in Monster\u2019s Ball, and the most interesting thing I\u2019ve seen her in of late is a fitness-themed, quasi \u201cthirst trap\u201d photo on Instagram. Mo\u2019Nique has been pretty vocal about her post-Oscar life. And while Taraji P. Henson was happy to be nominated for an Oscar in 2009, she struggled to get work until Empire came along.\n\nI know how Hollywood works for white people, particularly white men. You get a real hit that makes real money and win some awards, and you get a blank check to do, create, write, produce or direct almost anything you want almost in perpetuity, even when you struggle to make another hit.\n\nFor example, I don\u2019t expect director Ryan Coogler to win an Academy Award for Black Panther next year, but\u2014according to \u201cYou just made almost a billion dollars\u201d rules\u2014I do expect someone to whip out a blank check and tell him to go create.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s how Hollywood is supposed to work. Just as I expect all of Jordan Peele\u2019s film dreams to come true post-Get Out\u2019s success and his Oscar win Sunday night. Just as I expect Ava DuVernay to have a long and storied career post the Oscar-nominated Selma (and her new Disney film, A Wrinkle in Time).\n\nWhat I don\u2019t want to see is some Langston Hughes, \u201cWhat happens to a dream deferred?\u201d mess where everyone\u2019s potential dries up like a raisin in the sun.\n\nIt\u2019s not easy to be successful in film and television. Take it from someone with a failed TV show (or two) under her belt. But in a world where white men can fail upward until they succeed, black men and women who create, and are successful at creating, deserve the same opportunities, funding and support that, say, Zack Snyder or Michael Bay receive, despite the fact that they ruin most things they touch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, successful black creators deserve even more, since they have a proven record of success.

But, Get Out is a lot less comforting, which is probably why it didn\u2019t win Best Picture last night.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s safety in distance. That\u2019s one of the things you realize when surveying creative work that touches on prejudice in American society. Recent Oscar-nominated films about the black experience like Malcolm X, 12 Years a Slave, or Selma have all had the buffer of decades or centuries. They still hold up a mirror that reflects a history of institutionalized racism but there\u2019s a thick layer of dust covering the reflected image, letting viewers say \u201cThat only kinda looks like us; things have gotten better.\u201d\n\nThe Shape of Water has that same dust on it. The period-piece stylings in Guillermo del Toro\u2019s movie are meant to invoke the timeframe when B-movie monster features were all the rage. That element also ties in neatly to the fact that blatant racism and sexism ran rampant during the Cold War era. Nothing about the movie\u2019s lush romanticism or softly lit happy ending makes the viewer think about the plight of society\u2019s outsiders in the present day.\n\nBecause it\u2019s in the here-and-now, Get Out doesn\u2019t offer the easy dodge of distance. Its central plot mechanic calls on a history of exploitation and injustice that\u2019s continuing to happen. Lured in by white people he thought he could trust, Chris gets treated like a resource: a body to be hollowed out and a soul to be discarded. Niceties are said about his talent but doors aren\u2019t opened; instead, the bidders at the Armitages\u2019 backyard auction want to possess Chris\u2019 skills for themselves rather than have him create his own successes.\n\nLook, I\u2019m glad that Get Out and The Shape of Water won their respective awards last night. It\u2019s not insignificant that The Shape of Water is the first genre movie to win Best Picture since 2004, but Peele\u2019s win for Best Original Screenplay feels like a safe consolation prize, something big enough to be meaningful but not heavy with the ultimate weight of Best Picture.

Blige was the first person in Oscars history to be nominated for both an acting award and for best original song for the same film (and performed!). Jordan Peele became the first black person to score a win for best original screenplay. And in a surprise plot twist, Kobe Bryant is now also the first NBA player to score an Oscar win.\n\nAnd while we still have a long way to go in terms of representation (and after the success of Black Panther, we are anxious to see what next year\u2019s Oscars might bring), this year\u2019s ceremony was nevertheless filled with refreshing moments.\n\nOur favorite?

Christian Siriano and Tadashi Shoji have both become reliable industry sources for all-inclusive glamour, but Spencer nailed her look Sunday night courtesy of one of our fashion faves, Brandon Maxwell (who also dressed best actress winner Alison Janney and our hilarious homegirl Tiffany Haddish for the Vanity Fair after-party Sunday night). In a lovely Instagram post, Maxwell wrote:\n\nI am very proud, with my team, to have dressed Best Supporting Actress nominee @octaviaspencer in a custom emerald green satin faced organza gown for Tonight\u2019s 90th Annual Academy Awards. Octavia makes history tonight with her third nomination, and we are beyond honored to be a part of her special moment.\n\nWhat we loved about this dress is how well the belted silhouette and full, flowing skirt highlighted Spencer\u2019s curvy figure, as well as the deep emerald green, which played to perfection against her brown skin\u2014which we were thrilled to see more of on display. But our favorite aspect by far was the off-the-shoulder neckline, which framed her beautiful face and shoulders, which were grazed by a wavy bob, styled by celebrity hairstylist and groomer David Stanwell.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStanwell began working with Spencer five years ago while at the Cannes Film Festival to promote Fruitvale Station.

We always opt for curls going away from [the] face, and we alternate the tightness depending upon the size of the curling iron.

Instantly, I knew I wanted to do a side part, so that one side was off the shoulder to compliment her dress and jewelry.

For Spencer, he\u2019s been relying on a variety of Dove hair products, which, in his words, \u201c[have] helped with that shine and healthy glow that we all want for our hair.\u201d\n\nWe were curious, so he graciously gave The Glow Up a how-to on Spencer\u2019s wavy Oscars bob:\n\n\u201cI started prepping the hair by mixing Dove Style + Care Smooth & Shine Heat Protection Spray and a dollop of Dove Absolute Curls Supreme Cr\u00e8me Serum together to moisturize her hair before applying any heat.\n\n\u201cUsing a large, round brush, I blow-dried her hair to create the desired face-framing shape. We decided on taking the hair shorter [for the night], so after I blow-dried it, I made a deep side part to add more definition to the look.\n\n\u201cAfter I finished blow-drying the hair, I went through it with a 1-inch curling iron to create glamorous, defined waves by twisting the hair toward her face.\n\n\u201cWhile the hair was cooling, I sprayed Dove Style + Care Compressed Micro Mist Flexible Hold Hairspray to give it that extra hold before running my hands through to break up the curls. [Pro tip: Waiting until the hair is cool enough to run one\u2019s fingers through it gives it a fabulous curl that will last all night long.]\n\n\u201cAfter shaping the hair and dressing it around her face, I tucked the curls on the right side of her face behind her ear to give it a romantic feel and show off her jewelry. To finish, I sprayed Dove Style + Care Compressed Micro Mist Flexible Hold Hairspray again throughout the hair to give it a boost of shine.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe have to give credit to Stanwell and Spencer\u2019s entire glam squad for giving one of our screen queens the Cinderella moment she so richly deserved.

For Spencer, he\u2019s been relying on a variety of Dove hair products, which, in his words, \u201c[have] helped with that shine and healthy glow that we all want for our hair.\u201d\n\nWe were curious, so he graciously gave The Glow Up a how-to on Spencer\u2019s wavy Oscars bob:\n\n\u201cI started prepping the hair by mixing Dove Style + Care Smooth & Shine Heat Protection Spray and a dollop of Dove Absolute Curls Supreme Cr\u00e8me Serum together to moisturize her hair before applying any heat.\n\n\u201cUsing a large, round brush, I blow-dried her hair to create the desired face-framing shape. We decided on taking the hair shorter [for the night], so after I blow-dried it, I made a deep side part to add more definition to the look.\n\n\u201cAfter I finished blow-drying the hair, I went through it with a 1-inch curling iron to create glamorous, defined waves by twisting the hair toward her face.\n\n\u201cWhile the hair was cooling, I sprayed Dove Style + Care Compressed Micro Mist Flexible Hold Hairspray to give it that extra hold before running my hands through to break up the curls. [Pro tip: Waiting until the hair is cool enough to run one\u2019s fingers through it gives it a fabulous curl that will last all night long.]\n\n\u201cAfter shaping the hair and dressing it around her face, I tucked the curls on the right side of her face behind her ear to give it a romantic feel and show off her jewelry. To finish, I sprayed Dove Style + Care Compressed Micro Mist Flexible Hold Hairspray again throughout the hair to give it a boost of shine.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe have to give credit to Stanwell and Spencer\u2019s entire glam squad for giving one of our screen queens the Cinderella moment she so richly deserved. It\u2019s always exciting to see a star\u2019s style evolve, and while Spencer isn\u2019t known for glamorous roles, we\u2019re hoping to see these gorgeous, age-appropriate (and subtly sexy!) red-carpet moments continue for her.

Rodriguez (Getty Images)\n\nWhen writer-director Jordan Peele won his Best Original Screenplay Oscar for 2017\u2019s biggest hit, Get Out, I cheered. When cast members of 2018\u2019s biggest hit so far, Marvel\u2019s Black Panther, walked the red carpet at the 90th Academy Awards, I swooned. And when I looked out at the sea of (mostly) white people attending the Oscars, I wondered, \u201cDid Hollywood learn anything over the past year?\u201d\n\n\n\nOn a budget of less than $5 million, Get Out made $255 million at the U.S. box office last year. Girls Trip, directed by Malcolm D. Lee, made more than $140 million in 2017. Black Panther is on pace to do $1 billion worth of business worldwide, reaching $900 million over this past weekend. Movie-theater owners know what\u2019s up: Films that are more diverse put up numbers. But does Hollywood know that?\n\nIn a show of amazing discipline, no one of note (so far) has written a story lately expressing shock that black movies are having a moment. Because, technically, this \u201cmoment\u201d has been a known thing since the \u201990s (Wesley Snipes\u2019 vehicle Blade made $415 million in 1998). Or at least since Tyler Perry took his chitlin circuit plays and made Madea mainstream with 2005\u2019s Diary of a Mad Black Woman. If a movie is good, or at least steeped in our cultures and traditions, someone will happily plunk down more than $10 to see the flick. And studies show that films with diverse casts make more money.\n\nBut you can know all of this, make all the money, get all the accolades and still have a career that never quite hits the stratosphere after an Academy Award, thanks to good ol\u2019 prejudice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHalle Berry is a bona fide star with an Oscar for her role in Monster\u2019s Ball, and the most interesting thing I\u2019ve seen her in of late is a fitness-themed, quasi \u201cthirst trap\u201d photo on Instagram. Mo\u2019Nique has been pretty vocal about her post-Oscar life. And while Taraji P. Henson was happy to be nominated for an Oscar in 2009, she struggled to get work until Empire came along.\n\nI know how Hollywood works for white people, particularly white men. You get a real hit that makes real money and win some awards, and you get a blank check to do, create, write, produce or direct almost anything you want almost in perpetuity, even when you struggle to make another hit.\n\nFor example, I don\u2019t expect director Ryan Coogler to win an Academy Award for Black Panther next year, but\u2014according to \u201cYou just made almost a billion dollars\u201d rules\u2014I do expect someone to whip out a blank check and tell him to go create.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s how Hollywood is supposed to work. Just as I expect all of Jordan Peele\u2019s film dreams to come true post-Get Out\u2019s success and his Oscar win Sunday night. Just as I expect Ava DuVernay to have a long and storied career post the Oscar-nominated Selma (and her new Disney film, A Wrinkle in Time).\n\nWhat I don\u2019t want to see is some Langston Hughes, \u201cWhat happens to a dream deferred?\u201d mess where everyone\u2019s potential dries up like a raisin in the sun.\n\nIt\u2019s not easy to be successful in film and television. Take it from someone with a failed TV show (or two) under her belt. But in a world where white men can fail upward until they succeed, black men and women who create, and are successful at creating, deserve the same opportunities, funding and support that, say, Zack Snyder or Michael Bay receive, despite the fact that they ruin most things they touch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, successful black creators deserve even more, since they have a proven record of success. But until the best of us are treated as well by Hollywood as the worst of them, Hollywood won\u2019t have learned this lesson: Diversity sells. Black movies and their success aren\u2019t flukes. And talent is talent, and you should reward it. Nurture it. Take risks for it.\n\nEspecially when that talent just won an Oscar or raked in a billion dollars.", "keywords": ["know", "talent", "expect", "learn", "finally", "white", "successful", "nah", "oscar", "lesson", "black", "win", "million", "hollywood"], "polarity": 0.15548086498790728, "subjectivity": 0.4440389813629249},

(If you haven\u2019t already, join The Glow Up Facebook group to participate in a live red-carpet roundup with us at 6:45 p.m. EST.)\n\nBut in a season full of honors and awards shows, we have a special place in our hearts for the one with an independent streak. On Saturday the stars came out to celebrate the 33rd Annual Independent Spirit Awards in Santa Monica, Calif. And we didn\u2019t come away disappointed.\n\nAs its name suggests, the Independent Spirit Awards honor the best independent films of each year. The ceremony is presented by the organization Film Independent and traditionally takes place the day before the Academy Awards.\n\nOf course, as independent films have gained greater prominence in the mainstream in recent years, there has been increasing crossover between the nominees of the two events. But what keeps the Independent Spirit Awards so relevant and refreshing is seeing some of our faves get the recognition they deserve.\n\nFor instance, the big winner yesterday was director and writer Jordan Peele, who won in both the Best Director and Best Picture categories for his brilliant breakout hit, Get Out\u2014and was presented his awards by actor Chadwick Boseman and legendary director Spike Lee, respectively. We can only hope that his winning streak follows him to the Academy Awards Sunday night; but even if it doesn\u2019t, it was gratifying to see our favorite film of 2017 get the respect it deserved.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Tommaso Boddi (Getty Images)\n\nAnother big honor was given to director Dee Rees and the cast and crew of Mudbound, who were awarded the Robert Altman Award for a remarkable ensemble cast, director and casting director. Rees gave an incredible speech that drove home the fact that, in her words, \u201cMudbound is cinema.\u201d\n\n\n\nFilm Independent via YouTube\n\nBut perhaps our favorite aspect of the Independent Spirit Awards is how fully it lives up to its name. In contrast to the formality of the Academy Awards, the independent spirit is alive and well at this awards ceremony, and the stars revel in it.

Designer Brandon Maxwell\u2019s newly launched Spring/Summer 2018 advertising campaign, starring British model Jourdan Dunn and her surprise date, is a follow-up to his two previous and equally stunning campaign videos featuring models Riley Montana and Joan Smalls.\n\nGorgeous clothes, perfect bodies and pretty faces are the least of what we\u2019re treated to in Maxwell\u2019s videos, written and directed by the designer himself in collaboration with his longtime creative partner, Jessy Price. Each is striking in its intimacy as Maxwell unzips the model mystique, allowing us to peer into the souls of the women he loves to dress.\n\nFashion has a fairy-tale quality to it, and it\u2019s an element illustrated by Maxwell\u2019s clothes juxtaposed against the backdrop of his models\u2019 everyday lives. In his most recent campaign, Dunn gets confessional about her own transformative journey into modeling and motherhood, both while she was still a teenager. Dunn\u2019s life as a mother lies at the center of her video, filmed with her own tiny Prince Charming, 8-year-old son Riley.\n\nIt\u2019s a pure fantasy of a mother-son scenario, but nonetheless one that speaks to the dream of how we all like to think of those magical days of childhood, a time when seeing your mother happy, dressed up and looking lovely\u2014along with an extra ride on the carousel and a second ice cream\u2014was, in fact, real magic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up caught up with Maxwell via Instagram while he was burning the midnight oil, creating his next collection\u2014only two weeks away from being presented at New York Fashion Week. For him, Dunn\u2019s campaign video expresses something very special:\n\nIt\u2019s not about who you are, nor how much you can provide for your child; it\u2019s about the relationship, the act of doing something together, the love of a mother and the safety you feel when she says to you through action, \u201cYou matter, I see you, and I love you, right where you are.\u201d\n\nIn Maxwell\u2019s Fall/Winter 2017 campaign video, superstrong Puerto Rican model Joan Smalls celebrated her career and craft. She tells us not so much about herself, but reminds us that we should not forget the humanity of people, no matter the package in which they come\u2014glamorous or otherwise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDrenched in sunlight, wearing a cocktail dress, Smalls displays the discipline of a soldier as a team of tailors pins the little black dress to fit Smalls\u2019 tight curves while she stands stock-still. Then she elegantly bursts to life, strutting across the floor and instantly giving us an inside look at the role models play in making runway creations a reality. In a quote from the company\u2019s website, Maxwell describes the feeling of Smalls\u2019 shoot:\n\nI wanted to capture the collection the way that I see it during fittings and during the creation process. It helps to better explain why I create the clothes that I do, which are meant to enhance a woman\u2019s personality, goals, talents and desires\u2014never to outshine her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDetroit-born Ebony Riley\u2014now better known as Riley Montana\u2014came to the model game late, after completing her nursing degree. Despite the fact that models age in dog years, Riley broke out of the pack and became a star with the love and support of designers like Riccardo Tisci, Tom Ford and, most of all, Brandon Maxwell, whom she refers to fondly as her \u201cfather.\u201d\n\nMaxwell\u2019s video portrait of Riley explores her cosmic destiny in down-to-earth terms, from her beginnings in Detroit to \u201c a new reality.\u201d That reality is the fashion business, where she was asked to become another version of herself; \u201cone that was more relatable and that didn\u2019t offend.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRiley, a foster child, takes us into the place she calls \u201chome,\u201d proudly showing every intimate, unidealized and precious detail of a family life full of warmth and love, in stark contrast with the devastated urban landscape that lies outside the family\u2019s door. In Riley\u2019s words, all of these were things \u201cthat I was once [was] taught to hide\u2014but they make me who I am.\u201d\n\nIn this urban fashion fairy tale, Cinderella rescues herself, embracing the struggle to excel while not assimilating. Maxwell says:\n\nI\u2019ve spent so much time with Riley, and we talked about our lives and similarities. I realized that she\u2019s the embodiment of the woman I design for. The woman who, no matter what she\u2019s been through, puts on the clothes with her head held high.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat beautiful black girls might we expect to see high-stepping on Brandon Maxwell\u2019s runway this season?\n\n\u201cWe are still in the process of casting, so no spoilers!\u201d he says. \u201cEach season, we prioritize diversity in our runway casting and do our best to represent the Brandon Maxwell woman: strong, sophisticated and confident.\u201d\n\nYou can trust that The Glow Up will be there to see our beautiful queens serve the people in the next chapter of his fashion fairy tale.", "keywords": ["maxwell", "times", "maxwells", "model", "brandon", "love", "designer", "smalls", "models", "believes", "3rd", "blackgirlmagic", "video", "fashion", "riley", "campaign", "charm"], "polarity": 0.27941388373531234, "subjectivity": 0.556208410636982},

Watch it.\u2019 Honestly, a few of them had not even seen it and they were saying it, so dispelling that kind of thing has been super important.\u201d\ufeff\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, that line of thinking is as predictable as it is disheartening. Late last year, Jada Pinkett Smith voiced a similar frustration that the Hollywood Foreign Press didn\u2019t even watch the box-office smash Girls Trip, in which she co-starred, so that it could be considered for Golden Globe nominations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe film\u2014a departure from mainstream depictions of black trauma\u2014was loved by critics and moviegoers alike.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t get eyes on the film or a press conference,\u201d Pinkett Smith said via Twitter. \u201cHow could a nom happen and how much more critical acclaim must a movie have to simply get a screening?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to disagree with the artistic merits and value of a film, and surely, lovers of movies do all the time. It\u2019s quite a different matter to write off a film wholesale without even watching it\u2014especially when it is literally your job.\n\n\n\nAt least new one member of the academy, however, believes that the influx of new voters has already affected who gets awards, and could nullify a potential Get Out snub from the old Oscar guard.\n\n\u201cWhen Moonlight won,\u201d said the voter, \u201cit felt like the new members of the academy, myself included, really had made a difference.\u201d\n\n", "keywords": ["voter", "really", "let", "voters", "watched", "black", "wont", "older", "havent", "film", "oscar", "members", "movie", "academy", "oscargreat"], "polarity": 0.1344469696969697, "subjectivity": 0.5079660894660895},

Henson. Seriously, the woman so regularly kills it on the red carpet, we\u2019re ready to nickname her Buffy the Couture Slayer. At last night\u2019s Academy Awards, she certainly lived up to the moniker, putting her own slightly gothic spin on the goddess-inspired trend that threatened to take over the red carpet.\n\nWearing a sleek bob styled by Tymothe Wallace and a Vera Wang couture gown chosen by stylist Jason Bolden (who also dressed Ava DuVernay this Oscar weekend), the actress showed off her famously toned body with yards of chiffon, sheer paneling and an up-to-there slit, flashing us a gleaming length of leg throughout the evening\u2019s festivities.\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images)\n\nAnd because we never tire of an epic slay here at The Glow Up, when we heard that Henson\u2019s longtime makeup artist Ashunta Sheriff was dishing on the star\u2019s look last night, we naturally wanted the goods. I mean ... who wouldn\u2019t?\n\nFun fact: As both a model and, later, a first-time Grammy nominee, I was blessed to have my face polished to perfection by Ashunta Sheriff. I can personally attest that she is a master of her craft, and a makeup maven who makes contouring a breeze with the first-ever dual-ended foundation stick from her collection, Ashunta Sheriff Beauty. She\u2019s also generous enough to share her expertise: Time spent in her chair is as educational as it is beautifying!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images)\n\nOn that note, here\u2019s our favorite secret to how Sheriff created Henson\u2019s Oscar slay: Several components can be found right in your local drusgtore aisle. For instance, like Issa Rae\u2019s Golden Globes makeup artist, Joanna Simkin, Sheriff looked no further than a reliable household name to make sure Henson\u2019s skin took center stage last night. As she shared with The Glow Up:\n\n1. \u201cBecause Taraji\u2019s dress was Grecian and flowy and showed lots of skin, I wanted to make sure she was glowing and moisturized from head to toe! I used Vaseline Intensive Care Cocoa Radiant Lotion, made with deep healing moisturizers and Vaseline jelly; it was the perfect choice to show off her healthy, luminous skin.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. \u201cTo start off her makeup, I used Fenty Beauty by Rihanna Pro Filt\u2019r Instant Retouch Primer. Then Perfect Blend by Ashunta Sheriff, a dual-ended foundation and concealer that helps you get even in one step. Perfect Blend is the first dual-ended foundation and helps to tone down redness. The formula feels lightweight and wears like a second skin, giving you medium to buildable coverage. I used the shade medium for a natural soft coverage.\n\n\n\n3. \u201cFor Taraji\u2019s already amazing cheekbones, I used my fingertips for a softening effect to highlight, using Danessa Myricks Enlight Illuminator powder in Confidence. Its super-pigmented shimmer is my favorite. I contoured using Cozette S145 Perfect Contour brush and Cozette Infinite Contour Palette to sculpt cheekbones.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. \u201cFor the eyes, I used Kiss Beauty Blowout Lashes in Pixie. These lashes are perfect for sexy and soft looks; plus, Kiss makes affordable lashes that are comparable to high-end brands. I placed lashes close to Taraji\u2019s lash line, then created a thin line using Kiss Waterproof Wonders precision-point eye liner to create definition. I always marry faux lashes and real lashes with Kiss Mascara in Black.\n\n\n\n5. \u201cLastly, I finished the look off with lip liner in MAC Cork and filled in her lips as well, for longevity\u2014layering ensures the color lasts longer. To finish the lip, I applied the Lip Bar Liquid Matte Creme in Savage and Drama Queen.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAshunta Sheriff and Taraji P. Henson are clearly a match made in makeup heaven\u2014after all, what better color to use on Henson than \u201cDrama Queen\u201d? Henson certainly brought the drama last night, and with a slay game this consistent, we\u2019re not sure which we\u2019re more excited about: the Oscar-nominated actress\u2019s next film, or her next appearance on the red carpet!", "keywords": ["oscars", "slays", "using", "red", "henson", "kiss", "carpetagain", "taraji", "ashunta", "sheriff", "makeup", "tarajis", "perfect", "p", "glow", "lashes", "used"], "polarity": 0.1809403559403559, "subjectivity": 0.46866489991489985},

But fuck! The evidence was right there, and I still gave her the benefit of the doubt. Which makes me wonder if I just naturally give white people the benefit of the doubt. Or women. Or, gasp, white women.\n\nGet Out, of course, was as essential to 2017\u2019s collective zeitgeist as any other piece of art. The film was record-breaking, the characters\u2014pitch-perfect archetypes of subtly problematic liberal whiteness\u2014iconic, and the sunken place is now a permanent fixture of America\u2019s cultural lexicon. Before Get Out, Candyman and cockroaches were the only things that scared me. Now it\u2019s middle-aged white women with teacups.\n\nAnd the ending, well. I remember the dread I felt when I saw those police lights approach Chris. There\u2019d be no possible way for him to explain the dead white girl lying next to him and the dead parents a few hundred feet up the road. This is where, even though I was watching it in a theater, the realities of our reality became too stark and too heavy to ignore. And an alternative ending to the movie, which I watched for the very first time last week, depicted that worst-case but terrifyingly plausible scenario.\n\nKeeping that ending probably would\u2019ve made Get Out an even better movie. It would have completed the Kafkaesque journey it took us on, proving that Chris\u2019 efforts were ultimately futile. The moment he agreed to visit Rose\u2019s family, imprisonment was the only outcome. His sense of choice had been relinquished, his fate determined. But as much as I appreciate movies that end with a \u201cfuck your feelings\u201d (well, movies that end with a \u201cfuck your feelings\u201d except for Funny Games, because fuck that movie), I think I needed Get Out to end the way it did. I think I wouldn\u2019t have been able to watch it again if it ended with Chris behind bars.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd I think I think these things because of when Get Out was released. I saw it a month after Donald Trump was inaugurated. And I think I hadn\u2019t yet recovered from the shock of what had happened in our country in the months before that. (For the record, I still don\u2019t think I have. I\u2019ve had more random aches and aliments in the last 12 months than I had in the last 12 years combined. I doubt that\u2019s a coincidence.)\n\nThe ending, at least, allowed for a brief exhalation, a minuscule but meaningful respite from the world we\u2019d return to when the credits rolled. America had just reminded us that we\u2019re all Chris. That we\u2019re all stuck on the Armitage compound, all surrounded by people who call themselves allies and spin themselves as friends, all aware that something is off but not quite able to articulate exactly what it is. And I think I needed that catharsis. And by \u201cthat catharsis\u201d I mean \u201cto be saved by a ride-or-die homie with a gun and an innate mistrust of \u2018them white girls.\u2019\u201d", "keywords": ["end", "ending", "fuck", "wasnt", "think", "outs", "america", "movie", "ready", "depressing", "alternate", "white", "doubt", "women", "week", "realistic", "chris"], "polarity": 0.04457282913165267, "subjectivity": 0.45355975723622777},

Appearing for her third supporting actress nod for eventual best picture winner The Shape of Water, the actress and children\u2019s-book author was styled by sister team Wendi and Nicole in an ethereal green gown that evoked the flowing depths of the sea.\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images)\n\nAs we\u2019ve learned from several female celebs who don\u2019t fit the typical Hollywood starlet mold\u2014including being over 40 and not a sample size\u2014it can sometimes be a struggle to find red-carpet-worthy gowns. Christian Siriano and Tadashi Shoji have both become reliable industry sources for all-inclusive glamour, but Spencer nailed her look Sunday night courtesy of one of our fashion faves, Brandon Maxwell (who also dressed best actress winner Alison Janney and our hilarious homegirl Tiffany Haddish for the Vanity Fair after-party Sunday night). In a lovely Instagram post, Maxwell wrote:\n\nI am very proud, with my team, to have dressed Best Supporting Actress nominee @octaviaspencer in a custom emerald green satin faced organza gown for Tonight\u2019s 90th Annual Academy Awards. Octavia makes history tonight with her third nomination, and we are beyond honored to be a part of her special moment.\n\nWhat we loved about this dress is how well the belted silhouette and full, flowing skirt highlighted Spencer\u2019s curvy figure, as well as the deep emerald green, which played to perfection against her brown skin\u2014which we were thrilled to see more of on display. But our favorite aspect by far was the off-the-shoulder neckline, which framed her beautiful face and shoulders, which were grazed by a wavy bob, styled by celebrity hairstylist and groomer David Stanwell.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStanwell began working with Spencer five years ago while at the Cannes Film Festival to promote Fruitvale Station. He says he hit it off with the acclaimed actress the moment they met, telling The Glow Up: \u201cShe has a great sense of humor, and we always have a fun time together. She is professional, and all those elements make for a good work environment.\u201d\n\nThis awards season, Spencer\u2019s hair\u2014which Stanwell tells us is naturally curly and pressed out\u2014has consistently looked stunning, with the actress frequently rocking loose waves to accent her array of red-carpet looks. Stanwell tells us:\n\nOctavia loves curls in the hair\u2014big, medium, and sometimes smaller! We always opt for curls going away from [the] face, and we alternate the tightness depending upon the size of the curling iron. The only time we don\u2019t curl is if we do a slicked-back look with a bun or ponytail. As most award shows are long, we like to stick to simple and practical looks, yet still with a glamorous edge without being too fussy. Our influence always comes from classic and elegant so we always end up in that wheelhouse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Tristan Fewings (Getty Images)\n\nWhile Stanwell is always willing to gently push his star client to try something new and different, he\u2019s also very respectful of her comfort zone and happiness on the red carpet. But when Stanwell saw a sketch of Spencer\u2019s 2018 Oscar gown, he was inspired to take her look shorter to keep the shoulders bare, telling us:\n\nOctavia had sent me the sketch of her dress [last] week, which helped spark my inspiration for [Sunday night\u2019s] look. Instantly, I knew I wanted to do a side part, so that one side was off the shoulder to compliment her dress and jewelry. Octavia liked the idea of a curl, but not too brushed out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStanwell says his secret to keeping Spencer\u2019s hair looking glamorous and healthy is simpler\u2014and far less expensive\u2014than one might think. For Spencer, he\u2019s been relying on a variety of Dove hair products, which, in his words, \u201c[have] helped with that shine and healthy glow that we all want for our hair.\u201d\n\nWe were curious, so he graciously gave The Glow Up a how-to on Spencer\u2019s wavy Oscars bob:\n\n\u201cI started prepping the hair by mixing Dove Style + Care Smooth & Shine Heat Protection Spray and a dollop of Dove Absolute Curls Supreme Cr\u00e8me Serum together to moisturize her hair before applying any heat.\n\n\u201cUsing a large, round brush, I blow-dried her hair to create the desired face-framing shape. We decided on taking the hair shorter [for the night], so after I blow-dried it, I made a deep side part to add more definition to the look.\n\n\u201cAfter I finished blow-drying the hair, I went through it with a 1-inch curling iron to create glamorous, defined waves by twisting the hair toward her face.\n\n\u201cWhile the hair was cooling, I sprayed Dove Style + Care Compressed Micro Mist Flexible Hold Hairspray to give it that extra hold before running my hands through to break up the curls. [Pro tip: Waiting until the hair is cool enough to run one\u2019s fingers through it gives it a fabulous curl that will last all night long.]\n\n\u201cAfter shaping the hair and dressing it around her face, I tucked the curls on the right side of her face behind her ear to give it a romantic feel and show off her jewelry. To finish, I sprayed Dove Style + Care Compressed Micro Mist Flexible Hold Hairspray again throughout the hair to give it a boost of shine.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe have to give credit to Stanwell and Spencer\u2019s entire glam squad for giving one of our screen queens the Cinderella moment she so richly deserved. It\u2019s always exciting to see a star\u2019s style evolve, and while Spencer isn\u2019t known for glamorous roles, we\u2019re hoping to see these gorgeous, age-appropriate (and subtly sexy!) red-carpet moments continue for her.

I mean, we know she\u2019s an Oakland, Calif., native, and a child model-turned-Disney starlet. We know she appeared on Dancing With the Stars before scoring the coveted role of M.J. in the latest installment of the Spider-Man franchise. We even know she\u2019s also a singer whose 2014 single \u201cReplay\u201d hit No. 40 on the Billboard charts, and most recently she sang while swinging on a flying trapeze in Hugh Jackman\u2019s latest film, the Oscar-nominated The Greatest Showman.\n\nBut we can\u2019t really pinpoint the moment when she arrived\u2014on our radar, at least. It feels as if we just looked up one day and there she was, stunning and perfectly deserving of the spotlight. All we know is that we\u2019ve had a hard time taking our eyes off of her ever since, because she consistently gets it right on the red carpet.\n\nThe 90th annual Academy Awards ceremony was no exception. The Glow Up Facebook live thread collectively gasped when Zendaya appeared on the step-and-repeat in a one-sleeved, deep-sienna-colored chiffon gown by Giambattista Valli. (Notably, the gown beautifully photographed chocolate brown against the red carpet, then appeared a burnished burgundy against the Oscars stage set, where she was a presenter.) On another star, the voluminous silhouette might have been overwhelming, but at a willowy 5 feet 10 inches, the 21-year-old looked like a true goddess, even as an ingenue among established megastars.\n\nBut everyone knows it takes a village to raise a successful red-carpet look, and Zendaya has found a dream team in stylist Law Roach (who also styled Mary J. Blige for the evening), makeup artist Sheika Daley and hairstylist Ursula Stephen, the mastermind who created many of Rihanna\u2019s most iconic looks.\n\nTo offset the volume of her dress, Stephen chose to keep her starlet\u2019s hair stylish and simple, telling The Glow Up, \u201cZendaya and I went back and forth about her look for tonight\u2019s show, but ultimately landed on a sleek and chic top knot to enhance the elegant silhouette created by her Giambattista Valli dress.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images)\n\nBut pulled-back doesn\u2019t automatically mean easy, especially when you\u2019re creating a style that has to last from the awards ceremony through the after-party. So Stephen\u2014a brand ambassador for Unilever as well as Dyson hair products\u2014gave The Glow Up her step-by-step on how to create the perfect topknot\u2014using her go-to tools and products. With most of these products available in our local drugstore, frankly, this is a high-low tutorial we can wrap our heads around. Says Stephen:\n\n\n\n\u201cI prepped Zendaya\u2019s damp hair by spritzing Dove Style + Care Smooth & Shine Heat Protection Spray [$5.99] throughout before blow-drying as straight as possible with my Dyson Supersonic hair dryer [$399.99], which was on high heat and speed.\n\n\u201cOnce the hair was dry\u2014and super shiny!\u2014I sprayed with Suave Professionals Natural Hold Compressed Micro Mist Hairspray [$3.94] and separated her hair in half from ear to ear and brushed the top section into a high ponytail, securing it with an elastic.\n\n\u201cNext, I brought the bottom section up and secured the two pieces together before twisting them up into a chic little knot, which I secured with hair pins. [Pro tip: Separating the hair into sections allows for more control over the look and ensures security through the night.]\n\n\u201cI finished the look with TRESemm\u00e9 Compressed Micro-Mist Hair Spray Hold Level 2: Smooth [$4.99] to keep strands sleek and in place all night, without the stiffness and crunch of a traditional hair spray.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Christopher Polk (Getty Images)\n\nOf course, pulling the star\u2019s hair off her face perfectly showcased a glowing face and gorgeous sienna smoky eye by makeup artist Sheika Daley. [Editor\u2019s note: The Glow Up reached out to Daley for the specific tricks and tools she used Oscar night, but as of press time, we haven\u2019t received the details.] To re-create the look, we\u2019d suggest using eye shadow colors from the Masquerade palette by Juvia\u2019s Place ($25 for a mini palette), or the Obsessions palette in Warm Brown from Huda Beauty ($27). To quickly create a sultry, smoky eye similar to Zendaya\u2019s:\n\nApply an eye shadow base or primer, to lock in color. We like Black Up\u2019s new Matte Eye Primer ($23). Apply liquid liner to the upper lash line, avoiding an obvious cat eye. Define the outer corners of each crease with a dark matte brown eye shadow shade. Using a deep mahogany shade, smoke the eye from lash to just above the crease, extending slightly at the outer ends.\n\nUse a fine brush to lightly smudge the same color on the lower lash line. Pop the inner corners of the eyes with a shimmering champagne shadow. Apply several layers of mascara\u2014making sure to avoid clumps!\n\nNeedless to say, we loved this look, not only for its drama but also for its timeless simplicity. The 90th annual Academy Awards were so filled with nostalgia that Rita Moreno even wore the dress she wore when she accepted her 1962 Oscar (and still fit in beautifully!) for West Side Story.

(If you haven\u2019t already, join The Glow Up Facebook group to participate in a live red-carpet roundup with us at 6:45 p.m. EST.)\n\nBut in a season full of honors and awards shows, we have a special place in our hearts for the one with an independent streak. On Saturday the stars came out to celebrate the 33rd Annual Independent Spirit Awards in Santa Monica, Calif. And we didn\u2019t come away disappointed.\n\nAs its name suggests, the Independent Spirit Awards honor the best independent films of each year. The ceremony is presented by the organization Film Independent and traditionally takes place the day before the Academy Awards.\n\nOf course, as independent films have gained greater prominence in the mainstream in recent years, there has been increasing crossover between the nominees of the two events. But what keeps the Independent Spirit Awards so relevant and refreshing is seeing some of our faves get the recognition they deserve.\n\nFor instance, the big winner yesterday was director and writer Jordan Peele, who won in both the Best Director and Best Picture categories for his brilliant breakout hit, Get Out\u2014and was presented his awards by actor Chadwick Boseman and legendary director Spike Lee, respectively. We can only hope that his winning streak follows him to the Academy Awards Sunday night; but even if it doesn\u2019t, it was gratifying to see our favorite film of 2017 get the respect it deserved.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Tommaso Boddi (Getty Images)\n\nAnother big honor was given to director Dee Rees and the cast and crew of Mudbound, who were awarded the Robert Altman Award for a remarkable ensemble cast, director and casting director. Rees gave an incredible speech that drove home the fact that, in her words, \u201cMudbound is cinema.\u201d\n\n\n\nFilm Independent via YouTube\n\nBut perhaps our favorite aspect of the Independent Spirit Awards is how fully it lives up to its name. In contrast to the formality of the Academy Awards, the independent spirit is alive and well at this awards ceremony, and the stars revel in it. Even the step-and-repeat has a dynamically different quality as celebs pose for candid portraits, rather than typical paparazzi shots. Here are some of our favorites who were in attendance yesterday\u2014we only wish we were, too!\n\nAdvertisement", "keywords": ["stars", "streak", "celebrate", "biggest", "best", "films", "spirit", "awards", "independent", "academy", "director"], "polarity": 0.26517999544315335, "subjectivity": 0.49793233082706767},

Jay performed for roughly two hours. And I could have danced and rapped along for two more hours, easy. Obviously this is not news to anybody, but that man\u2019s catalog is STACKED. He ran through a few records from Reasonable Doubt (he did \u201cCan I Live\u201d to give a shoutout to D.C. drug kingpin Rayful Edmonds, \u201cD\u2019Evils\u201d and the first verse of \u201cDead Presidents\u201d over the \u201cAllure\u201d beat), quite a bit from The Black Album and The Blueprint and, of course, every song on 4:44 except \u201cLegacy\u201d and \u201cCaught Their Eyes.\u201d Of course, \u201cBig Pimpin\u2019\u201d and \u201cGive It to Me\u201d and \u201cEmpire State of Mind.\u201d\n\nBut NOTHING prepared me for the HUGE energy boost of him hitting \u201cBam\u201d and the intro line of \u201cFuck all that pretty Shawn Carter shit, nigga, HOV!\u201d The entire arena went apeshit on that as well as, always crowd favorites, \u201cPublic Service Announcement\u201d and \u201cU Don\u2019t Know.\u201d Personal favorite? \u201cImaginary Player,\u201d one of my favorite Jay records ever that I never thought I\u2019d see performed live. Single thug tear, bro. Single thug tear.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Jay is turning 48 next week. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a single other rapper outside of maaaaaaybe/likely Eminem (because white) who will be able to sell out 20,000-seat venues at that age. LL Cool J can\u2019t do it. Not by himself. And Capital One Arena (formerly the Verizon Center and MCI Center, aka the Phone Booth) was sold out. He might not have sold out every stop on the tour, but all 18,000-plus spots in Washington, D.C., were black history.\n\n3. I\u2019ve seen Jay maybe five times. The first time was back in the 1999 right after white people discovered him because of \u201cHard Knock Life,\u201d but he was still doing club spots, bringing along the likes of Amil and Memphis Bleek, which is how I first saw him at D.C. Live (RIP) on 9th and F streets. I wonder what THAT shit feels like\u2014to go from performing in a club on F Street to performing at an almost 20,000-seat arena two blocks away.\n\nNothing to see here\u2014just, I would love to ask what it feels like to live that life that\u2019s had such ups and downs and such a huge progression. Of course everybody has issues\u2014Lemonade and 4:44 are testaments to the fact that humans gon\u2019 human no matter how much money they have\u2014but it has to feel like playing with house money at some point, right?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Jay is my favorite rapper. To me, he is the GOAT. And it\u2019s not even close. Seeing him in concert running through 20 years of hits that we ALL knew, word for word, and watching the 50-plus Armenian dude in front of me dance like the whitest of dads just solidifies it to me.\n\nSure, lyrics, influence, fame, success, etc.\u2014in roughly all measures he\u2019s either at the top or very, very near it. But white-dad dancing? In a sea of young, cool, hip black people, those older white men and women gave no fucks and got their lives and had fun. I think Kanye is the only other rapper who could probably pull that off.\n\n5. That brings up another point\u2014the concert was actually fun. Jay is a very cool dude. Like, you\u2019d hang out with Jay in the way that I can\u2019t see anybody wanting to actually hang out with Kanye or Eminem. You might love those shows for their awesomeness, but fun? Jay is fun.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. Two rows in front of me was a stripper. And I don\u2019t feel no kinds of ways by saying she was a stripper without definitive proof because I ain\u2019t no judge, bih. Either way, this woman, who, if she wasn\u2019t a stripper, NEEDS to be a stripper because she\u2019s leaving money on the table, was putting in not-safe-for-WORK.\n\nSome song came on\u2014it escapes me, provided by the DJ after Vic Mensa and before Jay\u2014and she shot right up, bent over and started getting to twerking and gyrating and doing all kinds of shit that had people hitting \u201cvideo\u201d on their phones.\n\nLike, she was impressively inappropriate. She had on the bootiest of booty shorts and pulled them into her ass so that she could be at optimal twerk. Mind you, the rows were absolutely not that wide. Had she thrown her leg onto a chair and popped that ***** for a real nigga, I wouldn\u2019t have been surprised in the slightest. Why am I telling you this? Because sharing is caring.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. I realized last night that if I had to be a rapper for a day and perform a concert as that person, I\u2019d have to be Jay-Z. I knew about 90 percent of the words to every song he performed last night. I think Outkast (both Big and Dre) would be next, followed by maybe Biggie then Ice Cube and DJ Quik. What about you?\n\n8. I also realized last night why white people ask if they can say the n-word. It\u2019s because any one of them asking goes to rap concert and wants to know if they can rap along. Jay\u2019s song \u201cThe Story of O.J.\u201d starts off with \u201cLight nigga, dark nigga, faux nigga, real nigga\u201d\u2014you get my point. There were A LOT of white people in there last night, and you can bet I was looking around my section doing my black duty, ready to slap somebody in the mouth. Everybody stayed in their lanes, but you could tell it gets uncomfortable. Universally, white people, no. Just hum, nigga(s).\n\n9. I really wonder what it\u2019s like to be worth that much money. I had the same thought standing in front of Oprah, like, this woman can afford me. Like, you know how folks jokingly say shit like, \u201cYou can\u2019t afford me\u201d? For some people, that statement is literally not true at all. These things keep me up at night.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. Fuck all that pretty Shawn Carter shit, nigga, HOV! Pretty much.

A spectrum of vibrant fabrics are stacked to the ceiling, while dress forms stand half-draped in fabric, soon to join the rack of garments hanging along one full wall. In a corner beneath dozens of spools of thread, two industrial sewing machines sit lit and ready to turn out more of designer Whitney Mero\u2019s coveted creations.\n\n\n\nMero created the label over two decades ago; when asked for the origin story, she tossed back her trademark halo of tangled golden curls in laughter: \u201cThere\u2019s a respectable version, and there\u2019s a messy version. Which would you like to hear?\u201d Of course, The Glow Up wanted to hear both.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been shapely\u2014even as a child, I had a shape that was challenging for my parents to shop for,\u201d she shared. \u201cAnd as a result of that challenge, they put me in very ugly clothes. ... How do you dress a 12-year-old shaped like a grown person?\u201d\n\nAn adolescent Mero took matters into her own hands, getting an after-school job to fund her own clothing budget, shopping at thrift stores and then redesigning her finds into fresh styles. By her junior year in high school, she was making prom dresses for classmates when an older boyfriend suggested that she turn her talent into a business. The prospect was daunting but exciting:\n\nI remember taking a trip to Buffalo to visit a friend. I was talking to her mom about my idea and what I wanted to do, but having no clue how to do any of it. And she\u2019s like, \u201cWell, with all that ass you need to call it \u2018Onion.\u2019\u201d That\u2019s the messy version. The respectable version is I\u2019m answering the question, \u201cHow to dress for different kinds of women\u2014different sizes, different shapes, different needs, all while being stylish and comfortable.\u201d And for me that answer\u2014[from] that time onto this time\u2014is Onion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Mero tells it, despite any more lascivious overtones, the term \u201cOnion\u201d originated as a Southern euphemism for shapely figures. Forgoing fashion school in favor of Spelman College in her native Atlanta, she majored in sociology while continuing to hone her craft.\n\nAfter graduation and a stint in China, she based herself and her burgeoning business in New York City, where she began hosting trunk shows for her growing clientele. That\u2019s how Mero, an introvert who admits to being leery of the social aspects of retail, likes it:\n\n\n\nGrowing up, the idea of having a store where somebody would just have access to me was just not going to happen\u2014me having a place where you could just walk in? Fuck that. So I started at an early age, very early in the business, having these trunk sales. And then you can invite the people. You can set the tone, you get to control the setting ... it never occurred to me to have brick-and-mortar\u2014not just for that reason; the overhead is murder.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer lack of overhead, coupled with the growth of online retail, provided a model that perfectly suited both Mero\u2019s personality and the growth of Onion Cut & Sewn. Her line is a rarity in the retail sector: There are no manufacturers, and everything is truly cut and sewn by hand from whole cloth in the workshop that Mero also staffs and owns. Orders are as made-to-measure as possible and take 12-14 days to produce.\n\nMero describes it as \u201cpret-a-porter meets couture,\u201d yet amazingly, every item in her extensive line of dresses, separates and jumpsuits retails for under $200. It\u2019s a point of pride for the designer, all due to the strength of her online business:\n\nOnion should not be here; it\u2019s a beautiful accident. It should have been a lot harder for me. Having a store online and being able to take payments from damn near anywhere from anyone is really what grew the business.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut while technology makes it infinitely easier to sell, it\u2019s Mero\u2019s technical skill that developed her faithful following. She loves draping and primarily cuts on the bias; in her words: \u201cI love it when fabric moves with you, as opposed to you trying to make fabric do something that it doesn\u2019t do.\u201d\n\nAs a result, her designs\u2014some with names like \u201ctrap dress\u201d and \u201cfast lady\u201d\u2014naturally flatter a variety of figures. While undeniably feminine, they are never fussy, and remarkably feel as good as they are fashionable, thanks to Onion\u2019s signature fabric: jersey. Mero stumbled upon her favorite fabric almost by accident, but it\u2019s since become instrumental in creating the comfortable couture Onion is known for:\n\nI got really sick about 10 years ago, and I needed comfortable clothes. My skin was really jacked up, and I needed something that actually was soft and comforting. I started working with jersey, and then I just fell in love with it. ... I mean, I\u2019ve seen dresses fit a size 2, put that dress down and [get] picked up by a size 16, and it worked. You know, Miss Celie\u2019s pants. But I\u2019m a huge fan of jersey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlong with her love for the stretchy, travel-friendly cottons and rayons she uses in most of her designs, Mero is seemingly also her own muse. Her enviably compact and curvy frame is an ideal and relatable mannequin for her array of body-conscious but very forgiving silhouettes, and visitors to Onion Cut & Sewn\u2019s site will find the designer herself modeling most of her collection.\n\nIt could be argued that Mero represents the type of aspirational yet accessible allure her customers are seeking with every Onion purchase. But in her studio, she is refreshingly frank and unassuming, dressed down in a hoodie with her incredible hair in orbit around a bare face, while her impeccable cobalt manicure makes one wonder how she so effectively maneuvers a sewing machine. It\u2019s all part of Mero\u2019s personal credo, which extends to Onion Cut & Sewn\u2019s philosophy:\n\nYou put something on, and you feel great. I need it to feel like pajamas. ... But you know, the goal is, at the most, fundamental: Put one thing on and be able to leave the house and feel completely comfortable and confident in what you\u2019re wearing ... I want to design a star for people\u2014something that shines on you, without you necessarily having to shine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd women truly do shine in Mero\u2019s designs. Just ask good friend and #MeToo founder Tarana Burke, who wore a sequined black dress designed by Mero to grace this year\u2019s Golden Globes carpet. As Burke told The Glow Up:\n\nWhitney is a friend, but I have a very separate obsession with Onion Cut & Sewn. There was no question that I was going to wear one of her amazing creations on the red carpet at the Golden Globes. All of the women that night shied away from questions about who they were wearing, but I couldn\u2019t wait. I was proud to wear a black designer and proud to be wearing my girl\u2019s design. She makes impeccably tailored, comfortable, beautifully designed dresses, and the world should know about them.\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut while Mero finds Burke\u2019s choice to wear her design to the Golden Globes deeply meaningful, she says she couldn\u2019t care less about courting celebrity:\n\nYou know, people are celebrity-obsessed\u2014actually starstruck in a way that makes no sense. And I get that question: Well, what celebrities do you dress? And I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat the fuck [do] I need to dress celebrities for? I dress you. And unless you\u2019re telling me that you\u2019re not good enough\u2014which is not something I\u2019m ready to accept\u2014then stop asking me about celebrities. I don\u2019t care about a celebrity; ask them.\u201d I think that for Tarana to have basically lived a life of service without expectation, to be on the red carpet ... I love that version of it better than a model or an actor trying to be an activist, as opposed to a fashionable activist. I\u2019m not denigrating anyone, but you know the work has meaning. ... I\u2019d rather those people than celebrities, frankly, because celebrities have access to everything.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou likely also won\u2019t see Mero showing at New York Fashion Week, since she also doesn\u2019t do seasonal collections, telling us: \u201cThat means nothing to me. Whenever I want to introduce something new, I just introduce it.\u201d\n\nWhitney Mero is a woman who plays by her own rules. Similarly, her clothes represent a woman who has found both herself and her style, caring more about looking good than any fashion trend. Ironically, that\u2019s exactly what keeps an Onion Cut & Sewn design\u2014and its enchantingly irreverent designer\u2014always in fashion:", "keywords": ["know", "whitney", "onion", "sewn", "version", "im", "fabric", "comfortable", "having", "couture", "mero", "dress", "cut", "meros", "dressing"], "polarity": 0.27471558186159956, "subjectivity": 0.5654813303707109},

Just know that it all builds up to some hot mute-woman-on-fishman action in a bathtub.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWho created this movie?\n\nGuillermo del Toro.\n\nDoes he specialize in amphibian back breaking?\n\nNo. He\u2019s actually the mind behind Pan\u2019s Labyrinth, which is one of my favorite movies, and many other films melding fantasy and reality. He\u2019s a gifted filmmaker, and I think this is his first foray into fish fucking.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis actually sounds like quite an intriguing and ambitious film.\n\nI agree! Imagine the balls it takes to walk up in a studio like, \u201cGive me some money to make a period-piece porno about a fish that is also a spy.\u201d During his acceptance speech for his Best Original Screenplay win, Jordan Peele mentioned that he stopped writing Get Out \u201cabout 20 times\u201d because he thought it was impossible.\n\nWell, Get Out, both the best and the most important movie of 2017, lost last night to Grinding Nemo. So anything is possible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou mean anything is possible ... if you\u2019re not a black person?\n\nOh yeah. I forgot that part.\n\nAnything else?\n\nAs good as Black Panther is, its Oscar chances would probably be better if it were named A Fish Called Wakanda instead.", "keywords": ["original", "spy", "beat", "fish", "plot", "best", "fucks", "explained", "fishporn", "mean", "won", "hes", "oscar", "flick", "black", "movie", "picture"], "polarity": 0.14908536585365853, "subjectivity": 0.5382113821138212},

Watch it.\u2019 Honestly, a few of them had not even seen it and they were saying it, so dispelling that kind of thing has been super important.\u201d\ufeff\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, that line of thinking is as predictable as it is disheartening. Late last year, Jada Pinkett Smith voiced a similar frustration that the Hollywood Foreign Press didn\u2019t even watch the box-office smash Girls Trip, in which she co-starred, so that it could be considered for Golden Globe nominations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe film\u2014a departure from mainstream depictions of black trauma\u2014was loved by critics and moviegoers alike.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t get eyes on the film or a press conference,\u201d Pinkett Smith said via Twitter. \u201cHow could a nom happen and how much more critical acclaim must a movie have to simply get a screening?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to disagree with the artistic merits and value of a film, and surely, lovers of movies do all the time. It\u2019s quite a different matter to write off a film wholesale without even watching it\u2014especially when it is literally your job.\n\n\n\nAt least new one member of the academy, however, believes that the influx of new voters has already affected who gets awards, and could nullify a potential Get Out snub from the old Oscar guard.\n\n\u201cWhen Moonlight won,\u201d said the voter, \u201cit felt like the new members of the academy, myself included, really had made a difference.\u201d\n\n", "keywords": ["voter", "really", "let", "voters", "watched", "black", "wont", "older", "havent", "film", "oscar", "members", "movie", "academy", "oscargreat"], "polarity": 0.1344469696969697, "subjectivity": 0.5079660894660895},

Appearing for her third supporting actress nod for eventual best picture winner The Shape of Water, the actress and children\u2019s-book author was styled by sister team Wendi and Nicole in an ethereal green gown that evoked the flowing depths of the sea.\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images)\n\nAs we\u2019ve learned from several female celebs who don\u2019t fit the typical Hollywood starlet mold\u2014including being over 40 and not a sample size\u2014it can sometimes be a struggle to find red-carpet-worthy gowns. Christian Siriano and Tadashi Shoji have both become reliable industry sources for all-inclusive glamour, but Spencer nailed her look Sunday night courtesy of one of our fashion faves, Brandon Maxwell (who also dressed best actress winner Alison Janney and our hilarious homegirl Tiffany Haddish for the Vanity Fair after-party Sunday night). In a lovely Instagram post, Maxwell wrote:\n\nI am very proud, with my team, to have dressed Best Supporting Actress nominee @octaviaspencer in a custom emerald green satin faced organza gown for Tonight\u2019s 90th Annual Academy Awards. Octavia makes history tonight with her third nomination, and we are beyond honored to be a part of her special moment.\n\nWhat we loved about this dress is how well the belted silhouette and full, flowing skirt highlighted Spencer\u2019s curvy figure, as well as the deep emerald green, which played to perfection against her brown skin\u2014which we were thrilled to see more of on display. But our favorite aspect by far was the off-the-shoulder neckline, which framed her beautiful face and shoulders, which were grazed by a wavy bob, styled by celebrity hairstylist and groomer David Stanwell.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStanwell began working with Spencer five years ago while at the Cannes Film Festival to promote Fruitvale Station. He says he hit it off with the acclaimed actress the moment they met, telling The Glow Up: \u201cShe has a great sense of humor, and we always have a fun time together. She is professional, and all those elements make for a good work environment.\u201d\n\nThis awards season, Spencer\u2019s hair\u2014which Stanwell tells us is naturally curly and pressed out\u2014has consistently looked stunning, with the actress frequently rocking loose waves to accent her array of red-carpet looks. Stanwell tells us:\n\nOctavia loves curls in the hair\u2014big, medium, and sometimes smaller! We always opt for curls going away from [the] face, and we alternate the tightness depending upon the size of the curling iron. The only time we don\u2019t curl is if we do a slicked-back look with a bun or ponytail. As most award shows are long, we like to stick to simple and practical looks, yet still with a glamorous edge without being too fussy. Our influence always comes from classic and elegant so we always end up in that wheelhouse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Tristan Fewings (Getty Images)\n\nWhile Stanwell is always willing to gently push his star client to try something new and different, he\u2019s also very respectful of her comfort zone and happiness on the red carpet. But when Stanwell saw a sketch of Spencer\u2019s 2018 Oscar gown, he was inspired to take her look shorter to keep the shoulders bare, telling us:\n\nOctavia had sent me the sketch of her dress [last] week, which helped spark my inspiration for [Sunday night\u2019s] look. Instantly, I knew I wanted to do a side part, so that one side was off the shoulder to compliment her dress and jewelry. Octavia liked the idea of a curl, but not too brushed out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStanwell says his secret to keeping Spencer\u2019s hair looking glamorous and healthy is simpler\u2014and far less expensive\u2014than one might think. For Spencer, he\u2019s been relying on a variety of Dove hair products, which, in his words, \u201c[have] helped with that shine and healthy glow that we all want for our hair.\u201d\n\nWe were curious, so he graciously gave The Glow Up a how-to on Spencer\u2019s wavy Oscars bob:\n\n\u201cI started prepping the hair by mixing Dove Style + Care Smooth & Shine Heat Protection Spray and a dollop of Dove Absolute Curls Supreme Cr\u00e8me Serum together to moisturize her hair before applying any heat.\n\n\u201cUsing a large, round brush, I blow-dried her hair to create the desired face-framing shape. We decided on taking the hair shorter [for the night], so after I blow-dried it, I made a deep side part to add more definition to the look.\n\n\u201cAfter I finished blow-drying the hair, I went through it with a 1-inch curling iron to create glamorous, defined waves by twisting the hair toward her face.\n\n\u201cWhile the hair was cooling, I sprayed Dove Style + Care Compressed Micro Mist Flexible Hold Hairspray to give it that extra hold before running my hands through to break up the curls. [Pro tip: Waiting until the hair is cool enough to run one\u2019s fingers through it gives it a fabulous curl that will last all night long.]\n\n\u201cAfter shaping the hair and dressing it around her face, I tucked the curls on the right side of her face behind her ear to give it a romantic feel and show off her jewelry. To finish, I sprayed Dove Style + Care Compressed Micro Mist Flexible Hold Hairspray again throughout the hair to give it a boost of shine.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe have to give credit to Stanwell and Spencer\u2019s entire glam squad for giving one of our screen queens the Cinderella moment she so richly deserved. It\u2019s always exciting to see a star\u2019s style evolve, and while Spencer isn\u2019t known for glamorous roles, we\u2019re hoping to see these gorgeous, age-appropriate (and subtly sexy!) red-carpet moments continue for her.

We saw some solid debuts and some great sophomore follow-ups. To be honest, there aren\u2019t many projects released this year that I can say I viscerally hated, but that won\u2019t stop me from complaining about some of this year\u2019s biggest and most acclaimed albums that I just couldn\u2019t go up for. So in the spirit of Festivus, without further ado (in no particular ranking order), here are five albums released in 2017 that I never, ever, ever have to listen to again.\n\n1. CTRL, by SZA\n\nI really wanted to like this album. I\u2019ve been a huge fan of SZA since her early Soundcloud EP days, and while I realize I\u2019m going to sound like such an unbearable hipster, I like her old \u201cunderground\u201d shit a lot better. I get why CTRL resonates so much with its intended audience; that aside, in comparison with her other projects, it\u2019s quite lackluster.\n\nThe indie-artist welcome-to-my-kitchen accent thing she\u2019s doing is way more exaggerated on CTRL than on any of her other EPs. It\u2019s so ridiculous, it almost makes songs like \u201cSupermodel\u201d unlistenable. She sounds like a melaninneal (melanated and millennial) Barbara Walters warbling about heartache and insecurity throughout most of the album. A real disappointment. I just listen to \u201cSweet November,\u201d \u201cCountry\u201d and \u201cBed\u201d instead.\n\n\n\n2. More Life, by Drake\n\nAre we calling this an album or a \u201cplaylist\u201d? It doesn\u2019t matter\u2014it\u2019s going on the list. Like Views, More Life is more of Drake\u2019s new brand of global pop casserole that I DO NOT ENJOY. Do you know how it feels to be the only person who didn\u2019t instinctively wine their hips when \u201cPassionfruit\u201d came on in 2017??? Isolating. It\u2019s like being a Republican who believes in climate change. Even \u201cFake Love\u201d gets on my nerves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDrake has the vocal range of a dial tone, and while that may work on certain songs, I just cannot withstand a whole-ass project of his rhythmic humming and \u201cname that Diasporic accent\u201d challenges. The only thing I\u2019ve missed out on by avoiding Drake\u2019s music is being able to recognize when his songs are being referenced in dramatic picture captions on Instagram. I regret nothing.\n\n\n\n3. DAMN., by Kendrick Lamar\n\nDon\u2019t you just hate it when you can tell that a writer has no meaningful critique of a very popular and critically acclaimed album and can only offer shallow contrarianism? I don\u2019t know what it is, but every time I see K. Dot and his Black Israelite protective styles, my eyes begin to instinctively roll. Does this album have any other songs that people even like besides \u201cHumble\u201d and \u201cDNA\u201d?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is the album that I imagine is gonna be played at that \u201ccookout\u201d y\u2019all keep inviting all those white people to for showing a modicum of human decency, and I\u2019ll be more than pleased to miss out on teaching Deb and them how to \u201chit dem folks\u201d to \u201cLoyalty.\u201d\n\n4. Drunk, by Thundercat\n\nIs it OK to admit that Donald Glover made a better Thundercat album with Awaken, My Love! last year? I realize Thundercat is not exactly a household name, but I felt obligated to listen to Drunk in the name of black artistry. Thundercat is the kind of artist that people who like to earnestly call themselves \u201caudiophiles\u201d name-drop. That being said, Drunk, while clearly thematic and purposely uniform in sound, was still a monotonous chore to listen to, and I\u2019d rather fold laundry than revisit it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. 4:44, by Jay-Z\n\nOK, I actually enjoyed 4:44 for three or four weeks, but months later the only songs I can still muster the interest to listen to are \u201cMarcy Me\u201d and \u201cBam.\u201d It doesn\u2019t help that Jay is going on a \u201cYa know I cheated on my wife, right?\u201d public speaking tour and consistently dropping asinine gems and hot takes on every major media outlet known to man.\n\nJiggaisms on everything from marriage and financial investments to racial injustice are inescapable right now, and it\u2019s not because of quotables found on the album, but the narrative he needs to keep reiterating to sell the album\u2019s theme of introspection and redemption. 4:44 is a project that insists upon itself as a profound \u201cmoment,\u201d and Jay is not allowing the audience any room for inference. I\u2019m tired and ready for it to end.", "keywords": ["listen", "know", "going", "songs", "444", "drunk", "albums", "loved", "ctrl", "album", "thundercat", "2017"], "polarity": 0.0981569819069819, "subjectivity": 0.5516761016761017},
{"url": "https://verysmartbrothas.theroot.com/common-has-secured-the-bag-1823517019", "title": "/common-has-secured-the-bag-", "text": "Photo: Christopher Polk (Getty Images)\n\nCommon is killing the game; or, in today\u2019s parlance, Common has secured the bag. I\u2019m almost 40 years old, which means that I grew up in the \u201980s and \u201990s listening to Common (n\u00e9e Lonnie Rashid Lynn Jr.) when he was rapping about watermelons and communism and asking to borrow a dollar. I still own a copy of his classic album Resurrection, which has his name listed as Common Sense\u2014you know, before the lawsuit that had him change his name to Common.\n\nThe Common I see today is a far cry from the rapper Common (Sense) that used to be part of hip-hop great debates; his GOAT potential was always on the table. His One Day It\u2019ll All Make Sense (my God, \u201cInvocation\u201d is perfect) and Like Water for Chocolate albums are indisputable classics. Be is a classic Kanye album (seriously, Kanye had the most memorable verse on the entire record, and the intro song \u201cBe\u201d is easily one of Kanye\u2019s best beats of all time\u2014fight me, bro).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Common from the \u201990s was still beefing with all comers\u2014remember, this is the nigga who beefed with Ice Cube in his prime and Louis Farrakhan intervened, and who also took shots at both Hype Williams AND Puffy at their height on the Roots\u2019 \u201cAct Too (Love of My Life)\u201d from 1999\u2019s Things Fall Apart album. Com Sense from the City of Wind was Chicago\u2019s answer to Nas, a street poet who participated in the culture he was helping to curate in real time. He was part of the Soulquarians collective, pushing the genre forward artistically.\n\nAnd then shit changed. Common went from being a rapper\u2019s rapper to \u201cGlory,\u201d a rap song for white people who read Ta-Nehisi Coates books. His albums weren\u2019t bad, per se, but his verses were less biting, less edgy, less memorable and more generally vague mixed with corny attempts at crossover success. Gone was the social commentary in favor of comments to Jon Stewart on The Daily Show in 2015 like this, via HuffPost:\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019ve been bullied, we\u2019ve been beat down and we don\u2019t want it anymore. We are not extending a fist and we are not saying, \u2018You did us wrong.\u2019 It\u2019s more like, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m extending my hand in love,\u2019\u201d he said to host Jon Stewart. \u201cLet\u2019s forget about the past as much as we can and let\u2019s move from where we are now. How can we help each other? Can you try to help us because we are going to try to help ourselves, too.\u201d \u201cMe as a black man, I\u2019m not sitting there like, \u2018Hey, white people, y\u2019all did us wrong.\u2019 We know that existed,\u201d Common said. \u201cI don\u2019t even have to keep bringing that up. It\u2019s like being in a relationship and continuing to bring up the person\u2019s issues. Now I\u2019m saying, \u2018Hey, I love you. Let\u2019s move past this. Come on, baby, let\u2019s get past this.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, one could say that Common somehow stumbled into the sunken place, but that\u2019s not accurate at all. Assuming that the sunken place has something to do with access to or dating white women, that\u2019s not Common\u2019s ministry, for the most part. He\u2019s been linked with Taraji P. Henson, Serena Williams, Kerry Washington and, of course, the original knit-pants-procurement specialist, Erykah Badu. So what the hell happened? How does one of the most aggressive rappers whose entire M.O. was keepin\u2019 it real become hip-hop for white people?\n\nSimple. He secured the bag. And he found out what rappers who make a transition ALL say: Rap checks ain\u2019t shit compared with movie, television, commercial and \u201cWhite people love me\u201d checks. Common made it into television and movies, and even as a struggle actor in Wanted and Smokin\u2019 Aces, and an entirely unbelievable role as an NBA superstar in Just Wright opposite Queen Latifah\u2014another ultimate bag securer\u2014he was likely clearing more per film than most of his album royalty checks.\n\nThis man went from \u201cCom, I make righteous bitches get low\u201d to performing poetry at the White House to doing NPR Tiny Desks to winning an Oscar and several Grammys. He was a Gap model. He\u2019s in Microsoft commercials as the damn voice of Microsoft. Common figured out how to secure the fuck out of the bag, and his rapping suffered for taking a backseat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be clear, I don\u2019t think any of this is negative. At least not for him. Common might not be a very good rapper at this point, but hell\u2014he used to be hungry. This nigga is eating now. A lot. When he wants to and where he wants. He went from British Knights to Balenciaga. When your drive as a rapper is largely tied to being underappreciated, lack of respect or anger at society, better circumstances and access to money and resources change shit. Then the angst subsides. It\u2019s hard to stay mad in Ferragamo slippers and sippin\u2019 Dom Perignon, or at least not that White Star!\n\nIn fact, I\u2019ll bet Common laughs to the bank (or more likely laughs when direct deposit hits) every time he thinks about where he started and where he is now. He has made the absolute most of the hip-hop game. Folks reach out to him to do songs for major motion pictures that end up nominated for Academy Awards for the most vapid, boring, black-music-for-white-people bullshit (like \u201cStand Up for Something,\u201d with Andra Day, which might as well have been called \u201cGlory-er\u201d), and they cut big checks.\n\nHell, I\u2019m wondering if he even tries anymore, and he still secures the bag every time. His latest album, Black America Again, even missed the mark despite its supreme timeliness. There were some familiar flashes of brilliance and very solid production. It just didn\u2019t have ... it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPretty much, he\u2019s dad rap now\u2014he is a father\u2014but he still has all the respect of the hip-hop community for past achievements in the inner-city hip-hop arts.

Collectively, they\u2019ve undergone a bit of a cultural reckoning, as there has never been a hotter spotlight on their role in propagating, nurturing and fighting to maintain white supremacy. Even those who claim to be allies are becoming progressively less immune to criticism for their tone-deafness and their tendency to center themselves and their feelings over everything.\n\nPerhaps most emblematic of this particular type of conspicuous whiteness is Taylor Swift, who last year revealed herself to be 1) a fraud and 2) a fraud eager to take advantage of the interminable benefit of the doubt her white-womanness and celebrity provide to throw a black person (Kanye West) under the bus. I talked about this last year:\n\nNo one is better at this type of specifically White female performative faux melodrama\u2014where status is cultivated and maintained through a state of perpetual exaggerated victimhood (which everyone laps up because \u201csad White woman\u201d = \u201cLet\u2019s find our fucking capes and save her!\u201d)\u2014than she is. You know that co-worker (let\u2019s call her \u201cSusan\u201d) who somehow managed to use her offense at a minor breach in email etiquette (someone forgot to put an exclamation point on a sentence, which made Susan \u201cinterpret\u201d it as a \u201cthreat\u201d) as fuel for a raise and a promotion? Taylor Swift is Darth Susan.\n\n\u201cLook What You Made Me Do,\u201d the first single off of her upcoming Reputation, reiterates this theme, referring to a totally not-mysterious-at-all \u201cyou\u201d while ensconcing itself in victimhood like a top sheet smothered by appropriated throw pillows. It\u2019s as if her grade of uncut whiteness is so bright that it\u2019s blinding her gaslighting ass to the fact that we have receipts. We know who you are, Taylor. We don\u2019t believe you anymore. You need more people.\n\nAdding insult to Beckery is the preview for the yet-to-be-released video accompanying the single. Which, when considering the subject matter, would seem to be a clear allusion to Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Lemonade. In a vacuum, this wouldn\u2019t be an issue. Artists borrow from and exist as muses for one another all the time. Shit, just yesterday I borrowed a plate of cheese from Samantha Irby. (I didn\u2019t, actually. But I\u2019m sure Samantha has awesome cheeses.)\n\nBut when your single is a reference to that time you lied on that black guy to elicit sympathy and then got mad and sad that everyone saw through to your Regina George core, borrowing your visuals from a personal paean to black women ain\u2019t the best look.

Blige was the first person in Oscars history to be nominated for both an acting award and for best original song for the same film (and performed!). Jordan Peele became the first black person to score a win for best original screenplay. And in a surprise plot twist, Kobe Bryant is now also the first NBA player to score an Oscar win.\n\nAnd while we still have a long way to go in terms of representation (and after the success of Black Panther, we are anxious to see what next year\u2019s Oscars might bring), this year\u2019s ceremony was nevertheless filled with refreshing moments.\n\nOur favorite? Seeing Janet Mock, Patrisse Kahn-Cullors and Tarana Burke in the spotlight among an array of activists featured in Common and Andra Day\u2019s performance of their nominated song, \u201cStand Up for Something,\u201d from Marshall.\n\nBut this is The Glow Up, so aside from waiting to see if our faves would win, we fixed our collective gaze on the red carpet.

Hunt, \u201cYou can\u2019t outdo black people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith very few exceptions, we slayed the red carpet\u2014sometimes with a costume change. In an otherwise overly long ceremony, it certainly gave us something to look forward to. So, without further ado, here\u2019s how we showed up and out Sunday night:\n\nJanet Mock gave us old Hollywood glamour in this white gown. (Frazer Harrison/Getty Images) Common keeps his cool.

One of the best parts of Oscar night is the \u00fcber-exclusive annual Vanity Fair after-party, and our folks were out in force, giving us a bonus round of big fashion moments (minus one blue vest that felt a bit out of place amid all that glamour\u2014#SorryNotSorry).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was truly a night full of stars\u2014and they were outspoken and in full effect.

But fuck! The evidence was right there, and I still gave her the benefit of the doubt. Which makes me wonder if I just naturally give white people the benefit of the doubt. Or women. Or, gasp, white women.\n\nGet Out, of course, was as essential to 2017\u2019s collective zeitgeist as any other piece of art. The film was record-breaking, the characters\u2014pitch-perfect archetypes of subtly problematic liberal whiteness\u2014iconic, and the sunken place is now a permanent fixture of America\u2019s cultural lexicon. Before Get Out, Candyman and cockroaches were the only things that scared me. Now it\u2019s middle-aged white women with teacups.\n\nAnd the ending, well. I remember the dread I felt when I saw those police lights approach Chris. There\u2019d be no possible way for him to explain the dead white girl lying next to him and the dead parents a few hundred feet up the road. This is where, even though I was watching it in a theater, the realities of our reality became too stark and too heavy to ignore. And an alternative ending to the movie, which I watched for the very first time last week, depicted that worst-case but terrifyingly plausible scenario.\n\nKeeping that ending probably would\u2019ve made Get Out an even better movie. It would have completed the Kafkaesque journey it took us on, proving that Chris\u2019 efforts were ultimately futile. The moment he agreed to visit Rose\u2019s family, imprisonment was the only outcome. His sense of choice had been relinquished, his fate determined. But as much as I appreciate movies that end with a \u201cfuck your feelings\u201d (well, movies that end with a \u201cfuck your feelings\u201d except for Funny Games, because fuck that movie), I think I needed Get Out to end the way it did. I think I wouldn\u2019t have been able to watch it again if it ended with Chris behind bars.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd I think I think these things because of when Get Out was released. I saw it a month after Donald Trump was inaugurated. And I think I hadn\u2019t yet recovered from the shock of what had happened in our country in the months before that. (For the record, I still don\u2019t think I have. I\u2019ve had more random aches and aliments in the last 12 months than I had in the last 12 years combined. I doubt that\u2019s a coincidence.)\n\nThe ending, at least, allowed for a brief exhalation, a minuscule but meaningful respite from the world we\u2019d return to when the credits rolled. America had just reminded us that we\u2019re all Chris. That we\u2019re all stuck on the Armitage compound, all surrounded by people who call themselves allies and spin themselves as friends, all aware that something is off but not quite able to articulate exactly what it is. And I think I needed that catharsis. And by \u201cthat catharsis\u201d I mean \u201cto be saved by a ride-or-die homie with a gun and an innate mistrust of \u2018them white girls.\u2019\u201d", "keywords": ["end", "ending", "fuck", "wasnt", "think", "outs", "america", "movie", "ready", "depressing", "alternate", "white", "doubt", "women", "week", "realistic", "chris"], "polarity": 0.04457282913165267, "subjectivity": 0.45355975723622777},

The three-time Academy Award nominee, who won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for 2016\u2019s Fences\u201a is a regular on the awards circuit and is often called the \u201cblack Meryl Streep\u201d\u2014to which she rightly responds, \u201c[then] pay me what I\u2019m worth.\u201d\n\n\n\nIndeed, it\u2019s Davis\u2019 frank, fearless and unfailing honesty\u2014in her acting roles, her rising visibility as an advocate for equal rights and pay, and her willingness to talk about her own experiences of poverty and sexual abuse\u2014that has so endeared her to us.\n\nSo it\u2019s no surprise that Davis didn\u2019t hold back when speaking to digital magazine Porter Edit about the game-changing opportunity that came with playing Annalise Keating, the character that elevated her from supporting film roles into a leading\u2014and sexually liberated\u2014lady of television drama:\n\nI\u2019m 52 and darker than a paper bag. Women who look like me are relegated to the back of the bus, auditioning for crackheads and mammas and the person with a hand on her hip who is always described as \u2018sassy\u2019 or \u2018soulful\u2019. I\u2019ve had a 30-year career and I have rarely gotten roles that are fleshed out, even a little bit. I mean, you wouldn\u2019t think [these characters] have a vagina. Annalise Keating has changed the game. I don\u2019t even care if she doesn\u2019t make sense. I love that she\u2019s unrestricted, that every week I actually have to fight [showrunner] Peter Nowalk not to have another love scene. When does that ever happen?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat liberation has also been a revelation for Davis, who had to tap into a previously unexplored aspect of her tremendous talent to be free enough to play a woman in touch with her own sexuality and desire. Part of that process was realizing that sexiness doesn\u2019t only come in one package:\n\n... because very rarely in my career \u2013 and in my life \u2013 have I been allowed to explore that part of myself, to be given permission to know that is an aspect of my humanity, that I desire and am desired. I always felt in playing sexuality you have to look a certain way, to be a certain size, to walk a certain way. Until I realized that what makes people lean in is when they see themselves. There\u2019s no way I am going to believe that all women who are sexualized are size zero or two, all have straight hair, all look like sex kittens every time they go to bed and want sex from their man, all are heterosexual. I am mirroring women. I always say it is not my job to be sexy, it\u2019s my job to be sexual. That\u2019s the difference.\n\nDavis goes on to discuss the wage gap in Hollywood, referencing the recent move by actress Jessica Chastain to ensure that she and her Oscar-winning co-star Octavia Spencer would make equal pay on their next film together. Says Davis: \u201cCaucasian women have to stand in solidarity with us. And they have to understand we are not in the same boat.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd as both a Hollywood heavyweight and a survivor of sexual abuse, when asked if the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements would have gained momentum if brought forward by women of color, she is emphatically clear:\n\nNo. Recy Taylor came forward in 1944 when she was gang raped by six men in Alabama. Tarana Burke was the founder of the #MeToo movement in 2006. There are plenty of black women who have come forward. I don\u2019t think people feel we deserve the same empathy. Or investment. We are not as valued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavis has plenty more to say on the hypocrisy of Hollywood and how she navigates it as a black woman.

(He has a big one, remember?)\n\nBut on 4:44, dropped at the stroke of midnight on Tidal, he opens by bidding farewell to both the image and ego that cemented him in the urban American imagination. \u201cBye, Jay-Z,\u201d he says, paving the way for a conversation he hopes to have \u201cin a place of vulnerability and honesty.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat vulnerability reaches its apex in the title track, a contrite tribute to his wife, punctuated by Hannah Williams\u2019 wailing refrain, \u201cI\u2019m never gonna treat you like I should \u2026 \u201d More than a song, it hits the body like a four-minute-long pang of regret; a rare revelation from the man who cavalierly quipped, \u201cI\u2019m a pimp by blood, not relation; y\u2019all be chasin\u2019, I replace \u2019em \u2026 \u201d Instead, a more muted and matured megastar now rhymes:\n\nI wasn\u2019t ready, so I apologize\n\nI\u2019ve seen the innocence leave your eyes\n\nI still mourn this death, I apologize for all the stillborns\n\n\u2019Cause I wasn\u2019t present, your body wouldn\u2019t accept it\n\nI apologize to all the women whom I\n\nToyed with your emotions, because I was emotionless.\n\nIt\u2019s a passage that personally cut me to the core, along with many women (and perhaps a few men) I know. It\u2019s the apology so many of us feel we deserved but have never received. It speaks to a grown man\u2019s accountability\u2014and 4:44 is undeniably a grown man\u2019s album. It is complete, self-aware and clear in its intentions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhether it is a response to Lemonade is perhaps irrelevant. But listening, I couldn\u2019t help wondering if it would create the same ripple effect of affirmation and empathy for black men as its counterpart, which was hailed as a testament to both the glory and painfully requisite resilience of black women. As Candice Benbow, creator of last year\u2019s viral Lemonade Syllabus (she\u2019s hoping brothers will create one for 4:44), wrote about these companion pieces:\n\nLoving him almost killed her. As it has almost killed so many of us. Sometimes, it does kill us. The cost of loving like we do. Loving men who ain\u2019t ready or willing to be loved like that. Miscarriages. Blank stares. Soulless bodies. Robbed of time and hope. Broken. The cost is too high. It\u2019s just too much.\n\nWith 4:44, Jay-Z attempts to own some of this cost, too: the cost of broken trust, lost faith and shame from becoming so lost in his legend that he almost \u201clet the baddest girl in the world get away.\u201d They are profound confessions from a powerful man; ones that will likely ultimately earn him far more than he\u2019s lost (materially, at least), just as his wife both earned millions and an even higher level of artistic acclaim with her own confessional. And that\u2019s OK. In fact, it\u2019s what artists (see: Adele, Taylor Swift, Kanye, et al.) do: They spin pain into pop-culture gold\u2014or, in this case, platinum.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut what of us mere mortals? In this case, women too brokenhearted to even feel like the baddest girl on the block anymore\u2014let alone the world\u2014and the men we so desperately love(d)? Will black men take from 4:44 the permission to love and be loved completely? Will their pain\u2014as well as our own\u2014be validated by the testimonials of one of the biggest hustlers to ever play the game? Will they accept from Jay the lessons he claims to have gleaned from the mistakes of Eric Ben\u00e9t and Michael Corleone? Will 4:44 be for black men the healing tonic that Lemonade offered so many women? Or will it end up another drop in the bucket of the \u201cStars: They\u2019re Just Like Us!\u201d culture we love to identify with?\n\n\u201cSee! We\u2019re messy and dysfunctional AF, too!\u201d\n\nBecause as cathartic as 4:44 might be\u2014and it is, from start to finish\u2014in the end, it still speaks to a love, commitment and contrition that many of us will never experience. Even if we have the love, most of us will never have the therapy, the money or even the time to pause and self-reflect as Jay alludes to. Too many men (and women) will never make the apology. And despite his highly listenable cautionary tale, too many will inevitably cut off their noses to spite their faces\u2014ironically, because they\u2019re always reaching for something newer, better and badder than even their soul mates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe pain revealed by both of these albums is sometimes excruciatingly relatable. And like his bars on black wealth, there is much wisdom to be gained from Jay\u2019s revelations about black love. But for many of us, this kind of reckoning and reconciliation remains as aspirational as any other celebrity trope or Hollywood romance. Because for all the anger, anguish and negotiation of their dueling confessionals, theirs is ultimately a love still firmly on top. And while that\u2019s a beautiful testament to (billionaire, heterosexual) black love, until we collectively do the work, most of us will end up forced to forgive ourselves for awaiting an apology we\u2019ll never receive\u2014and shouldn\u2019t have to be the \u201cbaddest\u201d to deserve. And as Benbow notes, that\u2019s a song far more bitter than sweet:", "keywords": ["tale", "fighting", "love", "apology", "power", "444", "lemonade", "vulnerability", "jayz", "thats", "cost", "women", "black", "men", "fairy"], "polarity": 0.12895195578231292, "subjectivity": 0.5263414115646257},

She\u2019s got this undeniable Midas touch, which is why we want her to save America by running for president, but we don\u2019t deserve the precious soul that is Oprah as the leader of the free world. In fact, in order for her to keep her limitless effervescence, it\u2019s best that we keep Momma O away from politics.\n\nWe need the queen to remain in her current position so that she can bring us things like SuperSoul Conversations. This is Oprah\u2019s live event that\u2019s an extension of her three-time Emmy Award-winning series, SuperSoul Sunday, which features conversations between Oprah and top thinkers, authors, visionaries and spiritual leaders, exploring themes and issues including happiness, personal fulfillment, spirituality, conscious living and what it means to be alive in today\u2019s world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBasically, it\u2019s the gospel. And when the gospel came to New York City earlier this month, I had to be in the building. Oprah brought her SuperSoul Conversations to the historic Apollo Theater and sat down for a day of interviews with Jordan Peele, Trevor Noah, Yara Shahidi, Salma Hayek, Stephen Colbert and Lin-Manuel Miranda, and each conversation brought with it inspiration, belly laughs and aha moments.\n\nWhen Oprah walked out onto the stage, she gave the excited audience hope by saying, \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be all right,\u201d regarding how all of us are living in Trump\u2019s America. And then she welcomed her first guest, Oscar nominee Peele. Oprah couldn\u2019t help gushing over him. It was adorable. She physically leaned into his every word, and when she spoke of Rose from Peele\u2019s Get Out, Oprah said, \u201cKill the bitch!\u201d Y\u2019all, Oprah said that!\n\n\n\nShe admitted that she\u2019s not the biggest fan of horror, but Get Out challenged her to change her mind. Peele said, \u201cThe fact that we don\u2019t deal with our fears because they\u2019re so unpleasant doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re gone.\u201d This was an aha moment for Oprah, who then reasoned that watching horror movies in the theater is the safest way to experience your fears. Peele responded by saying that we make personal progress by not turning our backs on our own fears. He added, \u201cThere\u2019s a deficit in black men being allowed to be afraid and to fear.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeele said that he used Get Out as a vehicle for black men to explore their fear. That was such a dope conversation to witness. And it ended with Oprah letting Peele know that she\u2019d reach out to former President Barack Obama to find out what he thought of Get Out.\n\nThe good word kept coming through conversations with the brilliant Shahidi, of whom Oprah is also an extreme fan. If you\u2019ve ever heard the young woman speak, you\u2019ll know that she\u2019s basically a genius, spouting off knowledge about the world, activism, art, politics and more. Shahidi\u2019s conversation with Oprah centered on being part of a generation of changemakers, on how she\u2019s fascinated by civil rights and on her bright future. \u201cI\u2019m here to shift the perception of what\u2019s deemed possible,\u201d Shahidi said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo which Oprah replied, \u201cBaby, your future is so bright, it burns my eyes.\u201d\n\nAnd as the day went on, Oprah talked to our faves about a range of topics. With Miranda, Oprah talked about people of color having to work twice as hard for half the payoff; she marveled at Miranda\u2019s passion for giving back, especially to the people (his people) of Puerto Rico. She reminisced with Noah about growing up in poverty, and they bonded over their use of outhouses.\n\nHayek opened up about speaking out against sexual assault and said that Harvey Weinstein harassed her for over five years and said to her, \u201cI am going to kill you.\u201d She didn\u2019t write it in the New York Times article, but Weinstein allegedly told her, \u201cI am going to break the kneecaps of that cunt.\u201d The crowd was noticeably uncomfortable for Hayek.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Oprah has that magic, where she\u2019s able to dig out the biggest truth you\u2019ve never revealed and makes the space for you to share it for your own healing. It\u2019s beautiful to watch, but what are even more beautiful are the life gems you gain from her conversations.\n\nSo do yourself a favor, watch Oprah at the Apollo on OWN on Feb. 27 at 10 p.m. ET to see conversations with Jordan Peele, Salma Hayek and Trevor Noah and Tuesday, march 6 at 10 p.m. ET for Stephen Colbert, Lin-Manuel Miranda and Yara Shahidi.\n\nAnd if you don\u2019t have OWN, what are you doing? No, I\u2019m kidding. You can also listen on Oprah\u2019s SuperSoul Conversations podcast. Now go forth and live your best life!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: The best part was making my way into the official after party, which ended up being super intimate and Oprah literally greeted everyone there individually. And I got to take this picture with her.\n\n", "keywords": ["shahidi", "chakras", "shes", "brought", "conversations", "miranda", "oprah", "aligned", "apollo", "dont", "supersoul", "noah", "fears", "peele", "harlems"], "polarity": 0.2450367732625797, "subjectivity": 0.5730760950519015},

But where Sebastian Silva\u2019s Sundance flick differs from Jordan Peele\u2019s Oscar-nominated movie is that Tyrel exists without hypnosis or the sunken place.\n\n\n\nIt doesn\u2019t pack the overt racial punch in the gut that Get Out had, but Tyrel provides a nuanced exploration of human behavior and cultural differences that is delivered with a harrowing sense of reality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJason Mitchell (The Chi, Mudbound, Straight Outta Compton) stars as Tyler, who is in need of a break from the hustle and bustle of New York City after his girlfriend\u2019s family takes over their apartment. His friend Johnny (Christopher Abbott) suggests that he hang out with him and his buddies in their Catskills, N.Y., cabin to celebrate the birthday of Pete (Caleb Landry Jones). What appears to be an all-male affair where the bros can indulge in alcohol and conversation slowly devolves into something that Tyler isn\u2019t familiar with. And from unfamiliarity emerges an uncomfortable environment and, eventually, paranoia.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the film\u2019s title of Tyrel, while the protagonist\u2019s name is Tyler, is no mistake and is indicative of the cultural misunderstandings that abound.\n\nDuring their first drunken night at the cabin, Tyler is swiftly sobered up by the collective raucous behavior, with Pete being the most grating and unnerving of the varied personalities. This phase of microaggression isn\u2019t anything new for the group. But for Tyler, it\u2019s foreign territory that doesn\u2019t sit well with him. Rather than endear himself to the group, Tyler instead warms up to Cosmo, the family dog, and hides away from the crew behind his bond with the canine. Eventually, Tyler feigns fatigue and retreats to bed, but Johnny notices that his friend is acting oddly and calls him out for being a party pooper the following morning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThings don\u2019t get any easier when Alan (a charismatic Michael Cera) arrives to crank up the abrasive behavior another notch. Tyler tries to lose himself in seemingly endless gulps of Irish coffee, but it only heightens his paranoia and uneasiness. While the group of buddies welcome Alan\u2019s behavior, it\u2019s simply too unnerving for Tyler. Silly games that ask Tyler to use a \u201cblack accent,\u201d or when the group mocks religion, pull back the curtain on some racial prejudices that exist within the group. Perhaps none is more damning than when one of the partygoers mistakingly calls the protagonist \u201cTyrel.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard for Tyler to decide if his discomfort is racial, cultural or just a simple case of struggling to be social. But, ultimately, he realizes that this just isn\u2019t a crowd he can relate to, and it results in his making some irrational decisions as the weekend drags on.\n\nWhile Silva\u2019s film handles this situation very naturally, it lacks the punch of Get Out and opts to stew in its own despondence throughout the 86-minute runtime. It occasionally drags without anything of consequence taking place as the group\u2019s antics swallow up a majority of the screen time. And we don\u2019t really learn much about the partygoers or why they are the way they are, which forces them into one-dimensional characters. You have the gay guy, the eccentric guy, the hard-nosed guy, etc. Names don\u2019t really matter when you can identify them by their actions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat truly anchors the film is Mitchell\u2019s performance. He masterfully puts together a character who is a passive and well-intentioned presence and tries his best not to ruin the fun with the uneasiness he feels toward the group. But as the film carries on, their shenanigans wear him down and cause him to question whether or not these actions are designed to unnerve him or if he\u2019s just a little too paranoid about his surroundings. What Mitchell also does extraordinarily well is portray a man who unintentionally uses liquor as a truth serum of sorts. The more alcohol he consumes, the more comfortable he is with calling out their antics. His intoxication is believable as Mitchell handles the inner turmoil of Tyler with exceptional nuance.\n\nIt all leads to a final act where everything comes to a head and leads Tyler to come to grips with his surroundings. The story doesn\u2019t end neatly and seems to take a lot longer to get to the resolution than it actually does. However, it manages to be a tense, and not necessarily amusing, experience that will be digested differently depending on the viewing audience.", "keywords": ["mitchell", "place", "guy", "sunken", "isnt", "racial", "tyrel", "group", "hypnosis", "film", "dont", "sundances", "tyler", "behavior"], "polarity": 0.09661118763391491, "subjectivity": 0.45882220473129554},

Buoyed by Grammy-winning lead single \u201cYou Got Me,\u201d featuring Erykah Badu (who rerecorded Jill Scott\u2019s original vocals for a higher profile), the Roots\u2019 fourth album managed to be critically acclaimed and commercially successful, becoming their first album to go gold and eventually platinum.\n\nWhile \u201cYou Got Me\u201d and \u201cThe Next Movement\u201d were singles, the best song on the album\u2014and one of the most perfect musical creations of all time\u2014started out as an interlude that, by the grace of God and all things right in the world (I imagine Wakandan prophets had a hand in this), was expanded into a full-length song featuring Common, \u201cAct Too (the Love of My Life).\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s start with the music.

Sure, it\u2019s not just a beat\u2014it\u2019s more of a musical composition\u2014but it\u2019s so ethereal and beautiful and fit perfectly with the verses. There\u2019s a reason that the Roots realized they needed to expand it from an interlude. I imagine they were sitting in the studio listening to it and Questlove was like, \u201cI can\u2019t just listen to this for a minute and a half; I need this to last for at least five minutes.\u201d\n\nI could listen to it for 10. And then to infinity and beyond. Listen, I don\u2019t know what God\u2019s favorite song or album of all time is. I\u2019d imagine God has a pretty varied musical palate. But I\u2019d be willing to bet all of the money in my bank account that this song is on his \u201cBest of Humans\u201d playlist.\n\n\n\nLyrically, we have pre-Hollywood-fame Common where he was still spitting with hunger with a continuation of the same observant theme from 1994\u2019s classic ode to hip-hop, \u201cI Used to Love H.E.R.\u201d Common dropped his famous \u201cwhen we perform it\u2019s just coffee shop chicks and white dudes\u201d line and sent a few shots at Hype Williams and Puffy for turning hip-hop into commercial garbage (his opinion, not mine) with the shiny-suit era through their visuals and music, respectively. This was the Common we all knew and loved.\n\nOne of the knocks on Black Thought in all of the arguments about his GOAT status is that while he\u2019s clearly a top-tier lyricist, his verses are not memorable; most folks can\u2019t recite any lines or verses on instant recall. I\u2019ve made that argument. That\u2019s not the case on \u201cAct Too,\u201d for it\u2019s literally the only entire Black Thought verse I know from start to finish. When he opens up with \u201cThe anticipation arose as time froze, I stared off the stage with my eyes closed ... ,\u201d I can see it. It may help that the verse is short, checking in at waaaay less than 16 bars, but hey, the impact pushed back the first five rows.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven almost 20 years later, \u201cAct Too\u201d still impresses me when I hear it. When I\u2019m in the car and I can\u2019t think of anything to listen to, and I\u2019ve already listened to Midnight Marauders on repeat, I always fall back on Things Fall Apart, specifically so I can listen to \u201cAct Too.\u201d It\u2019s one of those songs that I can absolutely say have added to my own life by virtue of their existence. There are certain moments where artists create works of art that are nothing short of blessings. \u201cAct Too\u201d is one of those works of art, helping to explain why hip-hop is now and always will be a love of my life.", "keywords": ["listen", "act", "fall", "love", "life", "hiphop", "common", "perfect", "history", "black", "song", "things", "moments", "verses", "album", "music", "roots"], "polarity": 0.21462818003913892, "subjectivity": 0.45669710806697117},

Five years of building up black communities. Five years of experiencing police repression. Five years of centering black stories as the way we honor both the dead and the living. We took to the Oscar stage because Black Lives Matter refuses to stop fighting and loving and pushing for the dignity of black people everywhere.\n\nThere is an African proverb: \u201cUntil the lion tells the story, the hunter will always be the hero.\u201d In no place is that more true than American filmmaking. Each year, the Academy Awards are a celebration of hunters and a silencing of lions: a glorification of the lion\u2019s slaughter through the centering of white film and stories. These stories both create and feed white fantasy; they enable Eurocentrism and entitlement with carefully constructed, beautifully written tales about white love, war, domination, family, power and every imaginable interaction, both real and imagined, that affirms for white filmgoers that everything is, indeed, about them, and the stories remind people of color of their insignificance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis practice came to a head in 2016 when #OscarsSoWhite protested that every single Oscar nominee was white and most of the films made that year were white-centered. This in a nation where people of color were almost 40 percent of the population and were projected to outnumber whites by 2050; in a world where people of color were the vast majority\u2014whites constitute only about 16 percent of the global population; and at a time where people of color were unapologetically struggling for racial justice through #BlackLivesMatter and #NoDAPL.\n\nThe 2016 awards marked the taking of a side; it was a declaration that filmmakers were hunters. But the proverb about lions and hunters is not simply one of diversity and inclusion; it is ultimately a proverb about power. It is about whose stories get told and how the telling of stories both mirrors and embeds societal power.\n\nLions telling stories is about reframing who is the hero or shero. Lions telling stories is about reminding folks that there is a savanna undiscovered by hunters, that there are relationships between lions, between men and women, children and adults; there is a search for food and the building of shelter. For black people, there is love, not only war. Stories by and for black people are not fantasy. There is no time for escapism\u2014only radical imagining and freedom dreams for Wakandas and Wrinkles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStories are also about affirming our existence. In a world that tries to erase our presence, our stories are a claiming of space. They tell us that we are not alone or crazy, that we are not who they tell us we are. When black people tell stories, we also uplift black reality. We retell the stories of black struggle, not through the creation of a messianic leader or, worse, white saviors, but through the masses of black people who made up the civil rights movement in Selma.\n\nWe remind folks that when police steal the lives of our people, they are stealing fathers and sons who have love and laughter away from their daughters, mothers and uncles, as they did with Oscar Grant in Fruitvale Station. When black people tell stories, there is the amplification of black realities\u2014of realities yet untold except by those who live them.\n\nWhere are the films about stopping Los Angeles, the largest jailer in the world, from incarcerating people in black and poor communities? Where are the films about the 55,000 houseless people, the 1 in 22 black men, who live on the streets of Los Angeles? Where are the stories of Wakiesha Wilson, Ezell Ford, Redel Jones, Kisha Michael, Kendrec McDade, Anthony Weber or any of the 400 people killed in the last five years by police in Los Angeles County? Where are the stories of black domestic abuse survivors like Marissa Alexander, who dared to stand up to her abuser and was imprisoned for it in Florida, the same state where George Zimmerman was protected by \u201cStand your ground\u201d law as he stalked and murdered 17-year-old Trayvon Martin?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen black people\u2019s stories are told, we need not be perfect to be heroes; we can be complicated, broken and brilliant Killmongers. We can stand at the intersections of black, queer, revolutionary writer identities. When lions tell stories, they are messy and complicated and beautiful and ugly all at the same time. And every story shapes and is shaped by black realities.\n\nThe Black Lives Matter Global Network took to the Oscar stage because we are \u201crooting for everybody black\u201d\u2014because through black filmmakers, our stories are told without making the hunters the heroes.\n\nMelina Abdullah is professor and chair of Pan-African studies at Cal State L.A.

As she told Newsweek in 2017:\n\nWhat I do now, when I\u2019m taking on a film, I always ask about the fairness of the pay. I ask what they\u2019re offering me in comparison to the guy. I don\u2019t care about how much I get paid; I\u2019m in an industry where we\u2019re overcompensated for the work we do. But I don\u2019t want to be on a set where I\u2019m doing the same work as someone else and they\u2019re getting five times what I\u2019m getting.\n\nSo when Chastain approached Oscar-winning actress Octavia Spencer about doing a holiday comedy with her (the two first appeared together in 2011\u2019s The Help), the discussion naturally turned to the gender wage gap. But what Chastain wasn\u2019t prepared for was the wage gap she\u2019d yet to consider: how much less actresses of color make than their white counterparts.\n\nGood friend Spencer quickly brought her up to speed\u2014a conversation she recounted last week while on the Women Breaking Barriers panel at the Sundance Film Festival (Spencer\u2019s revelation begins at the 19:30 mark):\n\nWomen Breaking Barriers panel at Sundance 2018 (Golden Globes/YouTube screenshot)\n\nWe were dropping f-bombs and getting it all out there. And then I said, \u201cBut here\u2019s the thing: Women of color on that spectrum, we make far less than white women. So if we\u2019re gonna have that conversation about pay equity, we gotta bring the women of color to the table.\u201d And I told her my story, and we talked numbers, and she was quiet, and she said she had no idea that that\u2019s what it was like for women of color.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChastain did more than listen; she committed to bringing her new knowledge to the negotiating table, brokering what she called a \u201cfavored nations\u201d deal. As Spencer recalls:\n\nShe said: \u201cOctavia, we\u2019re gonna get you paid on this film. You and I are gonna be tied together. We\u2019re gonna be favored nations, and we\u2019re gonna make the same thing.\u201d\n\nChastain\u2019s negotiations sparked a bidding war for the film, which will be produced by Chastain and released by Universal Pictures, and resulted in salaries five times higher than what was initially offered, making Spencer\u2019s salary as an actor equal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Chastain told Business Insider in 2016:\n\nWe really need to look at ourselves and say we need to reevaluate this. We need to reevaluate women who ask for a pay raise or ask for a promotion. It\u2019s actually an okay thing. It\u2019s okay to be ambitious, it\u2019s okay to be over-prepared.\n\nIt may be the type of story that for some will evoke tropes of the \u201cwhite savior,\u201d or the much overused (and often misunderstood) term \u201cwhite allies.\u201d But for Spencer, it\u2019s simply an example of how true allies can effectively use their privilege for positive change: \u201cI love that woman, because she\u2019s walking the walk and she\u2019s actually talking the talk.\u201d", "keywords": ["worth", "im", "told", "gonna", "ask", "pay", "chastain", "white", "spencer", "helped", "privilege", "jessica", "women", "earn", "film", "octavia"], "polarity": 0.2190909090909091, "subjectivity": 0.3655952380952381},

The reason Kanye West\u2019s line is so memorable is that we\u2019ve all seen it happen. The idea that white women have always been a graduation present or lifetime achievement award for black men has become an accepted trope among black people. We quietly talk about it among ourselves, in barbershops and at cookouts.\n\nThe thought that rich, successful and famous black men eventually trade in black women for white women is such an acknowledged fact that we don\u2019t even bother pointing out that the guy who wrote and rapped it left our ass for a white girl.\n\nAt no time has that idea been more in focus than this week. The entire Umar Johnson controversy started over comments he made on The Breakfast Club about interracial dating. Johnson basically condemned black men who choose to date white women. While his comments were cringeworthy to most progressive, logical-thinking people, his explanation was almost like hearing someone describe a bout of explosive diarrhea\u2014you don\u2019t want to listen, but you can\u2019t publicly deny that you\u2019ve felt the same way.\n\nThat\u2019s also how many of us caught feelings listening to Jay-Z on 4:44 explain his regret over his affair with the infamous \u201cBecky with the good hair.\u201d I always believed that Jigga suffered more from the widespread notion that it was a nonblack woman with whom he cheated. I mean, if you can cheat on Beyonc\u00e9, with a white woman, is any black woman safe?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHov also released a video, \u201cFootnotes for 4:44,\u201d with a number of men explaining their relationship woes. Jesse Williams, the last of the light-skinned heartthrobs, appeared in the video and addressed his divorce and the pain he went through.\n\nThe feeling was echoed later in the week when news broke that Williams was dating Minka Kelly (see, I didn\u2019t call her \u201ca white woman,\u201d even though many of you know I suffer from a yet-to-be-named syndrome that renders me unable to tell white women apart). The intelligent part of your brain that makes kale smoothies and reads think pieces said, \u201cI don\u2019t care who celebrities date. That\u2019s their business.\u201d But the reptilian part of your brain that likes Real Housewives and occasionally will buy chicken from a gas station said, \u201cDamn! Not Jesse \u2018Woke Bae\u2019 Williams!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI don\u2019t know who Kelly is, but I assumed she was white (I didn\u2019t even Google her picture) because:\n\nHer name; I\u2019ve never met a black Minka. (I know a \u201cMeka\u201d and a \u201cMika,\u201d whom I am careful not to get confused because\u2014for some reason\u2014if you refer to someone named Tomika as \u201cTameka,\u201d you might as well just go full out and call them the b-word, because they are very sensitive about their shit.)\n\nJesse Williams is rich and successful. And as much as we want to deny the truth in it, when he gets on ...\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is not an indictment of Williams or of white women. Williams is free to choose whomever he wants to love, and he should. And it\u2019s not as if there\u2019s a ceremony that graduates black men to the white-woman dating pool and gives them a secret white-girl discount to use on Tinder. It\u2019s just a reflection of the society we live in.\n\nThere was a beautiful piece of writing a few days ago that examined the new movie The Big Sick. In the movie, a Pakistani man chronicles his love affair with his white girlfriend. Aditi Natasha Kini wrote a beautiful piece about watching men always choose the white woman. However, I don\u2019t know if a black woman could write this without being castigated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd that\u2019s where the unlikely trio of Umar Johnson, Jesse Williams and white women all meet. Politeness and rules of inclusiveness won\u2019t let us say it out loud. Our kale minds don\u2019t want to accept it, but our gas-station-chicken-eating brains know that there is a universally intrinsic value to white women, and it is not just an American thing. It is beat into the head of every single human being on earth from the moment we are born, and black men\u2014like all others\u2014have bought into it. White women are the global standard of beauty. Everything about them, from the way they wear their hair to the color of their lips, is imitated and monetized by every civilization on the planet.\n\nThe brainwashing is so pervasive that it has managed to bypass our instinct and nature. Most societies want to perpetuate their culture by having the men marry within it. Ask a Korean mom, a Jewish family or an Indian father, and they will most likely tell you that they hope their children marry someone of their faith, ethnicity or nationality. There are even studies that show men marry women who remind them of their mothers.\n\nBut white women are the exception.\n\n\n\nAs a man, I know it. I feel it. I see it. But there is nothing on earth more attractive to me than a black woman. It might be racist of me to say that everything else pales in comparison, but I am often called a racist, so\u2014everything else pales in comparison.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know it\u2019s uncouth to express these thoughts out loud, but I\u2014and I bet many black women\u2014wonder how someone can switch so easily. From afar it looks like kicking your mother to the curb. To the black people \u201cleft behind,\u201d it feels like the person who switched sides chose to stiff-arm their culture and their people. My experience as a human on this planet is colored by the lens of living as a black man. I can\u2019t fathom choosing to spend my life with someone who will never be able to understand that.\n\nBut then again, I\u2019m not \u201con,\u201d yet.\n\nIf we\u2019re being honest, we\u2019ll agree that black women are the ones on whose shoulders Williams\u2019 platform of #BlackGirlMagic speeches and BET awards was built. They didn\u2019t make him famous, but the core support that made Williams a star was from black women who thought he was cute, outspoken and smart\u2014as if Steph Curry joined the Black Panthers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliams\u2019 new girlfriend in no way means that he has lessened his commitment to the causes and issues he championed. And yes, Williams can and should date whomever he wants. As a rule, everyone on the planet should love whomever they choose to love. We should not let cultural norms fence in our relationships. But we aren\u2019t required to suppress our disappointment.\n\nI imagine that it feels a little bit shitty to navigate the trials of life with someone and have to stand there and watch that person leave\u2014regardless of whom he or she leaves with. But living in a country that seemingly wakes up every day with the express purpose of making sure you know that, simply because of the color of your skin, you will always be in second place\u2014and then having to watch the men who were supposed to protect and accompany you walk away, hand in hand, with facsimiles of your oppressor\u2014must be pretty tough.\n\nWe don\u2019t have to hide those feelings, even if they seem illogical. Emotions are not meant to have logic. We can say it out loud, and we don\u2019t have to give a damn what people think about the sentiment, because it is natural.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlus, anyone who cares is probably gonna leave your ass for a white girl.", "keywords": ["jesse", "know", "johnson", "love", "jayz", "white", "umar", "allure", "week", "women", "williams", "black", "dont", "woman", "men"], "polarity": 0.09563172374147984, "subjectivity": 0.4369899635143536},

With over two decades in the trenches, Torres, who founded Wax Poetics magazine and was also executive editor at the lyrics site Genius, is now vice president of the urban catalog at Universal Music Enterprises. And in his new role, he\u2019s launched Universal Music\u2019s latest imprint, Urban Legends.\n\n\n\nUrban Legends can be described as a repository or catalog of all things hip-hop from Universal Music. The site will celebrate anniversaries of some hip-hop classics, as well as provide its audience with new and inventive ways to interact with the music and its artists. In an interview with The Root, Torres discusses his goals for the site, as well as his own vinyl loves.\n\nThe Root: How did the Urban Legends imprint concept come about?\n\nAndre Torres: I come from media, having run my own magazine and running the Spotify collaboration at Genius. When I got this position, I was looking at how things were being marketed and how hip-hop was dominating on music streaming services, but obviously there\u2019s no liner notes there, or some of the things I grew up with.\n\nI also knew younger people are now into collecting vinyl and obsessing over stuff. I figured it was good to start with one central location where we can bring everything together\u2014whether it\u2019s content, exclusive-material drops or all of our releases\u2014and act as a hub for Universal Music Group. It\u2019s urban music, going back decades. I think a lot of what people are listening to, catalogwise, there\u2019s a way to tie all of that together, and Urban Legends is the perfect destination for that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Root: How has the site been received so far?\n\nAT: It\u2019s been great. We had a soft launch before the holidays and did a redesign a couple of weeks ago. We\u2019ve been getting a good response. I\u2019ve brought in Lauren Nostro, who I knew at Genius, and Tyrine Howard, who was at Fake Shore Drive, who\u2019s running social. We come from the music-media world, and I don\u2019t see us as competition from other music sites; they\u2019re our \u201chomies.\u201d We\u2019re going to them saying, \u201cYo, you love this record, why don\u2019t you come here and write about it?\u201d It\u2019s really a spot for fans. We\u2019re finding our niche and what works well for us, and discovering what is possible out here.\n\nTR: With your own background within music, how has the landscape changed since you started in music journalism?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAT: It\u2019s like night and day. Being in print media in the early 2000s, it was a much different game. The label system was stronger, there was a lot of indie labels. This was preweb. Once the internet became a huge part of music culture, its effect on the way people consumed music, it had a drastic effect on what content was being made around music and how people\u2019s attention spans were shifting.\n\nLabels, much like media companies who were focused in music, have been scrambling and trying to figure out what works. It\u2019s a process, because what worked two years ago doesn\u2019t even now. The Facebook algorithm switches so quickly, you have no other choice but to take it day by day. People are hungry for content, context and discovery, and whether you\u2019re talking about preinternet and now, a lot of that hasn\u2019t changed. There\u2019s a lot of freedom artists have now, and kids are free to express themselves in ways we haven\u2019t seen.\n\nTR: With Universal, who\u2019s had everyone from Tupac to Dr. Dre, what do you think their legacy is when it comes to hip-hop music?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAT: Looking at Universal with all of its tentacles globally, it\u2019s the biggest record label in the world. When I was looking into what this position means, and the material I\u2019d have my hands on, it was hard to argue with, because you\u2019re talking everything from Pac to Dre. From Def Jam to Motown. There\u2019s huge catalogs. There\u2019s a wealth of material at Universal.\n\nOver the years, we\u2019ve been there from the beginning of hip-hop, and this company has been committed to urban music from its inception. And them bringing me over proves how much more of a commitment the company has, and understands the importance of urban music.\n\nTR: Everyone who knows you knows you\u2019re a vinyl head. As a vinyl head, what\u2019s your favorite record?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAT: I own thousands and thousands of records. That\u2019s one of the hardest questions that you could ask me. One record that always pops up in my head is\u2014and it\u2019s revolutionary for me\u2014is 3 Feet High and Rising, De La Soul. Also, James Brown\u2019s The Popcorn record is revolutionary for me. It\u2019s difficult to name just one.\n\nTR: What do you think people are missing from not having a vinyl experience?\n\nAT: I think there\u2019s always been a sort of tactile part of music listening. It\u2019s always been that physical element. This younger generation is kind of the first that doesn\u2019t have that. But even with streaming music becoming a No. 1 genre, vinyl sales are still up year after year. And the No. 1 vinyl retailer is Urban Outfitters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYounger people are now looking for that tactile moment. Even though people have everything on their phone, people still want to be able to have something to show people what they love. And vinyl allows that. Kids are luckier nowadays because they have many more options and have the best of both worlds.\n\nTR: Where do you see Urban Legends in a year?\n\nAT: I want to build a strong community of super-hardcore fans of urban music. I want people to experience the catalog and making of these records with anniversaries of music. And how younger artists are influenced by our history of music, as well as physical products we\u2019ll be releasing this year. It\u2019ll put Urban Legends in a different light.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m not trying to do what has been traditionally done in a catalog space. We have great anniversaries this year, from Black Star to Slick Rick\u2019s Great Adventures. This year will be big on the content and product side. As we keep the momentum going, people will clearly understand that the site is where it\u2019s at. Hip-hop\u2019s catalog is dominating, and Urban Legends is positioned to do that better than everyone else.\n\nTo learn more about Urban Legends, visit its site.\n\n", "keywords": ["site", "torres", "urban", "catalog", "vp", "vinyl", "hiphop", "theres", "platform", "musics", "legends", "universal", "talks", "music", "editorial"], "polarity": 0.1860886959482465, "subjectivity": 0.39524125687047035},

Blige will attend the 90th Academy Awards not as a guest, presenter or simply a performer, but as a dual nominee for best supporting actress and best original song for Dee Rees\u2019 gripping post-World War II drama, Mudbound. It\u2019s a remarkable first-time feat for a first-time nominee; no other person has ever been nominated in an acting and song category for the same film.\n\nIn Mudbound, Blige plays Florence Jackson, the beleaguered but noble matriarch of a sharecropping family in rural Mississippi. Her stillness often anchors the film, riveting your attention to her every time she is on-screen. In the months since the film\u2019s release and growing Oscar buzz, Blige has spoken frequently about harnessing the power of her sadness from her ongoing divorce from former manager Kendu Isaacs for the role, as well as stripping down to play Florence Jackson. From Vulture:\n\nI\u2019m Mary J. Blige. I mean, like, this is what I do. I wear wigs, I wear bob wigs, and I had to completely strip down to my own natural hair texture, which I\u2019ve always been afraid of. Dee stripped me down all the way to what I truly am, and people were complimenting me. People were saying how beautiful I was. I didn\u2019t know I was that beautiful for real. You understand what I\u2019m saying? I didn\u2019t know that.\n\nTwo-time Emmy Award-winning hairstylist Lawrence Davis was instrumental in that transformational \u201cmakeunder,\u201d using both his extensive historical knowledge and incredible skill to render the Queen of Hip-Hop Soul almost unrecognizable to audiences at last year\u2019s Sundance Film Festival, where Mudbound premiered. Said director Rees: \u201cThe great surprise at Sundance was that people didn\u2019t know it was her until the credits rolled.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Derek Blanks\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIntrigued by the power of Blige\u2019s natural beauty, The Glow Up had the opportunity to talk with Davis about stripping down a megastar like Mary J. Blige, whom he describes as \u201cone of the shyest women on earth ... and so super-sweet.\u201d He tells us:\n\nI remember Mary\u2019s first day coming in for a camera test; I had specific directions from Dee Rees about how she wanted Mary just to strip down. She\u2019s like, \u201cI don\u2019t want wigs, I don\u2019t want this, I don\u2019t want that; I want it all organic.\u201d I said, \u201cYou got it.\u201d So Mary came in the trailer, and she sat in my chair, and we talked a little bit, as I was like, \u201cWell, I just need to get you to trust the process. Trust me to take you where you want to go, and if anything feels uncomfortable, we\u2019ll talk through it. So I [asked], \u2018Are you ready?\u2019 She\u2019s like, \u2018I\u2019m not taking my wig off in front of all these people!\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavis accommodated, clearing out the hair and makeup trailer to unmask the artist as well known for her assortment of blond coifs, lengthy manicures and thigh-high boots as for her hit-making urban ballads and bangers. Of course, Blige tried to negotiate her way into wearing a natural wig to play a sharecropper\u2019s wife, but Davis remained firm:\n\n\u201c\u2018No ... Dee wants you. She wants you to strip down,\u2019\u201d he told Blige. \u201c\u2018She don\u2019t want to see Mary; she wants to see Florence Jackson walk in there for this camera test.\u2019\u201d\n\nDavis ultimately won her trust, peeling back both wig and tracks of weave to reveal Blige\u2019s natural hair. Throughout Mudbound, audiences are seeing Blige\u2019s natural texture at work in creating humble updos and a single scene in which we see her shoulder-length hair hang free. While the star was leery at first, she soon succumbed to the process\u2014and the freedom that came from releasing the trappings of being Mary J. Blige. Says Davis:\n\nShe basically let herself go, and she became Florence right there in that trailer. And with that, it was just taking any hair she had on her head out\u2014no hair, no weave, no wig\u2014taking her nails off, her lashes off. Basically, you got organic Mary. And I would say about the second, third day, Mary was coming in the trailer full-on Afro, just totally free ... [A]nd I could definitely see that she had this freedom that she did not have day one from that point on. And with that, it just took me saying, \u201cYou\u2019re Florence Jackson.\u201d I said, \u201cFlorence, she\u2019s a woman\u2014she lives on a farm, but she takes care of herself. She washes her clothes, she washes her kids\u2019 clothes. She does the best with what she has; she\u2019s a groomed woman. She lives on a farm in the South in the \u201940s. But she takes care of herself and her family.\u201d And that\u2019s who Mary became; she became Florence Jackson.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMary J.

Blige and director Dee Rees working on Mudbound (Netflix) 1 / 8\n\nAs for the personal woes that Blige was admittedly experiencing during filming, Davis says he was unaware of the specifics at the time, but definitely noticed the emotional transformation that took place:\n\n[T]here were times when I could feel the heaviness\u2014but didn\u2019t know what it was. But I will say that I literally saw that heaviness go away as she got into this character, and she came in there every day and became Florence Jackson. She started talking more, and that heaviness that was there, it disappeared during this movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs lead hairstylist on Mudbound, Davis was entirely in his element. The Baltimore native has a specific affinity for period hairstyles and has previously flexed his knowledge and skills behind the scenes of era-specific projects like The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, Bessie and Hairspray Live!\u2014for which he won the second of his two Emmys.\n\nDavis got his start in his native city, owning his own salon before making the brave choice to sell it and move to Los Angeles in 2001. Halle Berry\u2019s then-stylist Neeko Abriol gave Davis a shot in his salon, and doors immediately began to open. He has since garnered 81 film and television credits, in addition to leading the hair teams of Being Mary Jane, Greenleaf and Claws. But it is the period pieces that remain his true passion. Case in point: His current project is styling Mahershala Ali into virtuoso pianist Don Shirley for the upcoming film Green Book. As Davis tells The Glow Up:\n\nI honestly feel like I\u2019ve been reincarnated, because as long as I remember\u2014even from being a young kid\u2014I gravitated toward anything that was vintage. Vintage cars, vintage clothing; I loved thrift stores because of the vintage clothing. And when I first got a call to do a period piece, I was most excited because it got to the root of what I wanted to do. You know, hairstyling is great, and I love it. But there\u2019s something that I\u2019m drawn to when it comes to period styling. I love the authenticity of it, and how it brings forth the story and tells the story without there even being any verbiage. You can look at the person and see where they\u2019re from, or what\u2019s going on with them because of maybe the economic setting, but just the style that they\u2019re adorned with\u2014the beautiful hair, the beautiful clothes, the beautiful makeup\u2014all of that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Derek Blanks\n\nBut, specifically, Davis loves working with the natural textures of black hair, and is emphatic that it be portrayed accurately on-screen. For him, there is an eternal elegance to natural hair. He believes that natural hairstyles belong in every film and on every red carpet because they are part of our legacy of style:\n\nBlack women, even before they started pressing their hair, they basically knew how to create these wonderful shapes out of natural hair; these silhouettes and things like that that speak elegance and class without pressing it out and going bone straight and having it go silky and shiny. It just was a beautiful, beautiful thing to see. ... But we definitely have the most beautiful hair to me on earth. And you know we wear it well, and I think that in any period movie\u2014no matter what period it is\u2014I think there always should be a black woman with natural hair. ... I just feel like black hair\u2014natural hair\u2014should always be a part of it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut if Davis is excited about the resurgence of natural hair on-screen and on the red carpet alike, he also loves that even black women who wear wigs are gravitating toward styles with more texture in them (e.g., Viola Davis\u2019 incredible Golden Globes look this year). He predicts that at the Oscars this Sunday and many to come, we may bring even more natural styles and braided updos to the step-and-repeat, and tells us:\n\nI think women are much more open to showing exactly, you know, what\u2019s under that wig as opposed to covering up nowadays. And I look at every award show and I always see somebody come forth and say, \u201cNo, this is who I am, and this is who I have been and I want to show it.\u201d ... I think that even when other races look at us and see us out there in our natural form, they love it, because it tells them how proud we are as a people and how proud we are to show what\u2019s natural about us, and what\u2019s unique about us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly how Davis thinks it should be. For him, natural hair has always been far more than just a trend or a movement: \u201cJust call it us. ... I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a movement anymore; I just think it is reality. It\u2019s who we are, and we\u2019re proud of it.\u201d", "keywords": ["mudbound", "natural", "florence", "hair", "hiphop", "netflix", "davis", "soul", "unmaking", "lawrence", "j", "blige", "mary", "talks", "beautiful", "hairstylist", "queen"], "polarity": 0.2369808449695669, "subjectivity": 0.49995972073039713},

Appearing for her third supporting actress nod for eventual best picture winner The Shape of Water, the actress and children\u2019s-book author was styled by sister team Wendi and Nicole in an ethereal green gown that evoked the flowing depths of the sea.\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images)\n\nAs we\u2019ve learned from several female celebs who don\u2019t fit the typical Hollywood starlet mold\u2014including being over 40 and not a sample size\u2014it can sometimes be a struggle to find red-carpet-worthy gowns. Christian Siriano and Tadashi Shoji have both become reliable industry sources for all-inclusive glamour, but Spencer nailed her look Sunday night courtesy of one of our fashion faves, Brandon Maxwell (who also dressed best actress winner Alison Janney and our hilarious homegirl Tiffany Haddish for the Vanity Fair after-party Sunday night). In a lovely Instagram post, Maxwell wrote:\n\nI am very proud, with my team, to have dressed Best Supporting Actress nominee @octaviaspencer in a custom emerald green satin faced organza gown for Tonight\u2019s 90th Annual Academy Awards. Octavia makes history tonight with her third nomination, and we are beyond honored to be a part of her special moment.\n\nWhat we loved about this dress is how well the belted silhouette and full, flowing skirt highlighted Spencer\u2019s curvy figure, as well as the deep emerald green, which played to perfection against her brown skin\u2014which we were thrilled to see more of on display. But our favorite aspect by far was the off-the-shoulder neckline, which framed her beautiful face and shoulders, which were grazed by a wavy bob, styled by celebrity hairstylist and groomer David Stanwell.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStanwell began working with Spencer five years ago while at the Cannes Film Festival to promote Fruitvale Station. He says he hit it off with the acclaimed actress the moment they met, telling The Glow Up: \u201cShe has a great sense of humor, and we always have a fun time together. She is professional, and all those elements make for a good work environment.\u201d\n\nThis awards season, Spencer\u2019s hair\u2014which Stanwell tells us is naturally curly and pressed out\u2014has consistently looked stunning, with the actress frequently rocking loose waves to accent her array of red-carpet looks. Stanwell tells us:\n\nOctavia loves curls in the hair\u2014big, medium, and sometimes smaller! We always opt for curls going away from [the] face, and we alternate the tightness depending upon the size of the curling iron. The only time we don\u2019t curl is if we do a slicked-back look with a bun or ponytail. As most award shows are long, we like to stick to simple and practical looks, yet still with a glamorous edge without being too fussy. Our influence always comes from classic and elegant so we always end up in that wheelhouse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Tristan Fewings (Getty Images)\n\nWhile Stanwell is always willing to gently push his star client to try something new and different, he\u2019s also very respectful of her comfort zone and happiness on the red carpet. But when Stanwell saw a sketch of Spencer\u2019s 2018 Oscar gown, he was inspired to take her look shorter to keep the shoulders bare, telling us:\n\nOctavia had sent me the sketch of her dress [last] week, which helped spark my inspiration for [Sunday night\u2019s] look. Instantly, I knew I wanted to do a side part, so that one side was off the shoulder to compliment her dress and jewelry. Octavia liked the idea of a curl, but not too brushed out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStanwell says his secret to keeping Spencer\u2019s hair looking glamorous and healthy is simpler\u2014and far less expensive\u2014than one might think. For Spencer, he\u2019s been relying on a variety of Dove hair products, which, in his words, \u201c[have] helped with that shine and healthy glow that we all want for our hair.\u201d\n\nWe were curious, so he graciously gave The Glow Up a how-to on Spencer\u2019s wavy Oscars bob:\n\n\u201cI started prepping the hair by mixing Dove Style + Care Smooth & Shine Heat Protection Spray and a dollop of Dove Absolute Curls Supreme Cr\u00e8me Serum together to moisturize her hair before applying any heat.\n\n\u201cUsing a large, round brush, I blow-dried her hair to create the desired face-framing shape. We decided on taking the hair shorter [for the night], so after I blow-dried it, I made a deep side part to add more definition to the look.\n\n\u201cAfter I finished blow-drying the hair, I went through it with a 1-inch curling iron to create glamorous, defined waves by twisting the hair toward her face.\n\n\u201cWhile the hair was cooling, I sprayed Dove Style + Care Compressed Micro Mist Flexible Hold Hairspray to give it that extra hold before running my hands through to break up the curls. [Pro tip: Waiting until the hair is cool enough to run one\u2019s fingers through it gives it a fabulous curl that will last all night long.]\n\n\u201cAfter shaping the hair and dressing it around her face, I tucked the curls on the right side of her face behind her ear to give it a romantic feel and show off her jewelry. To finish, I sprayed Dove Style + Care Compressed Micro Mist Flexible Hold Hairspray again throughout the hair to give it a boost of shine.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe have to give credit to Stanwell and Spencer\u2019s entire glam squad for giving one of our screen queens the Cinderella moment she so richly deserved. It\u2019s always exciting to see a star\u2019s style evolve, and while Spencer isn\u2019t known for glamorous roles, we\u2019re hoping to see these gorgeous, age-appropriate (and subtly sexy!) red-carpet moments continue for her.

You\u2019ve never done this before; no one informed you how to do this. You don\u2019t even have the tools to do it \u2026\n\n\u201cWill 4:44 be for black men the healing tonic that Lemonade offered so many women?\u201d This was the question I asked after hearing Jay-Z\u2019s own confessional addressing the pain and shame of trying to repair a broken relationship.\n\nWith the subsequent release of \u201cFootnotes for 4:44,\u201d the short film accompaniment to his title track, Jay-Z joins a slew of famous contemporaries to ruminate on what it means to be a man in relationships with women\u2014specifically, black relationships. The revelations are raw and revealing, exposing struggles with giving and receiving honest communication, grappling equally with demons and vulnerability and with fears of ending up alone. And unlike Beyonc\u00e9 in Lemonade, Jay-Z unequivocally addresses the reality within the rumor mill:\n\nThis my real life. \u2026 We built this big, beautiful mansion of a relationship that wasn\u2019t totally built on the 100 percent truth, and it started cracking. And then things start happening that the public can see. ... And then we had to go to a point and be like, \u201cOK, tear this down and let\u2019s start from the beginning ... \u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, let\u2019s start from the beginning and keep it 100 percent. Admittedly, after watching \u201cFootnotes for 4:44,\u201d I was so relieved to see and hear such an outpouring of masculine honesty and humility that my first instinct was a slow-clap standing ovation\u2014until I remembered that I\u2019m not personally involved with any of these men. When my editor asked if I\u2019d be willing to address it as a follow-up to my earlier piece, I couldn\u2019t possibly imagine what I\u2019d say that hadn\u2019t already been said better by the likes of Anthony Anderson, Kendrick Lamar, et al.\u2014not to mention what was said in dozens of other think pieces since.\n\nBut yet again, I wondered about the impact that these epiphanies might have on those without the platforms, the resources and the impetus to become self-aware. How can we help our men\u2014our people\u2014find or create the space to be free to love, too? What tools can we provide those who frequently lack the very foundation upon which to build functional relationships? Whose ability to focus on the emotional is all too often sublimated by the work of survival?\n\nI would break that down by telling them to think of the most excruciating thing you could feel, as far as a loss. How would that make you feel? Recognize that emotion \u2026 prior to it even happening.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn his appearance in \u201cFootnotes,\u201d Lamar calls this\u2014not just the loss, but the ability to put oneself in another\u2019s shoes\u2014a matter of \u201cperspective\u201d and \u201ccompassion.\u201d Similarly, Meek Mill admits that he had to learn to care for somebody as much as he cared for himself. They\u2019re both referring to as an age-old, but apparently still novel concept known as empathy\u2014also known as \u201cthe Golden Rule.\u201d And if there is a tool that might be of greatest use in our collective arsenal, empathy might be it.\n\nIn 4:44, Jay-Z reveals that it took fathering a daughter to consider how she might experience the world as a woman\u2014which is somewhat ironic, considering his wife\u2019s chart-topping single \u201cIf I Were a Boy.\u201d But what if we were able to teach our sons and daughters to approach relationships with that awareness from the onset? Or, more powerfully, to approach each other with an empathy that is typically absent elsewhere? What if we treated each other with the care and compassion that America refuses to, if only out of sheer defiance of that denial?\n\nAs Audre Lorde famously admonished us: \u201c[T]he master\u2019s tools will never dismantle the master\u2019s house. They may allow us to temporarily beat him at his own game, but they will never enable us to bring about genuine change.\u201d Our lack of empathy for each other\u2014as contemporaries, comrades, partners\u2014has come to mimic the world\u2019s, becoming as much a threat to our collective survival as any external factors. And yet it is perhaps the only factor we have complete control over, at present, and arguably far easier to acquire than the collective wealth Jay is also urging us to build.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast year, Kid Cudi\u2019s admissions about his own struggles with anxiety and depression prompted leagues of black men to create the safe space to ask, #YouGoodMan? Similarly, the collective works of 4:44 present an opportunity for those same men to discuss emotional health and relationship readiness. Are we good to each other, in both intention and actions? Can we at least aspire to be?\n\nFor those of us black women who love men\u2014black men especially\u2014we can\u2019t tell you not to be hardened by the experience of being an endangered species in America (or beyond) or to magically transcend being the products of your environment by simple virtue of our love. At least, not on our time. Truth is, we\u2019re hardened, too; but please know that our pain runs not in opposition or competition but, rather, in tandem with yours.\n\nIf we show you ours, will you show us yours?\n\nIn \u201cFootnotes,\u201d Will Smith half jokingly proclaims, \u201cThere\u2019s some shit you don\u2019t want to know about your partner.\u201d But for the survival of our relationships and of blackness as a whole, can we afford to continue willing ourselves not to know? In hopes of building stronger unions, perhaps all we can do is sit and listen, the way we hope to be heard. And when it comes to the work of getting each other free enough to love in a world that often has no love for us, perhaps the best relationship advice ultimately comes from Jay-Z\u2019s wife:\n\n\u201cShow me your scars, and I won\u2019t walk away.\u201d", "keywords": ["footnotes", "relationships", "love", "power", "444", "vulnerability", "tools", "collective", "relationship", "black", "start", "building", "men"], "polarity": 0.15773577268142483, "subjectivity": 0.5272001247544723},
{"url": "https://verysmartbrothas.theroot.com/how-do-you-listen-to-hip-hop-1822763759", "title": "/how-do-you-listen-to-hip-hop-", "text": "On Feb. 2, 2018, Brooklyn, N.Y., wordsmith Skyzoo released an album called In Celebration of Us. I don\u2019t know exactly how I decided to listen to it\u2014I can\u2019t call myself a Skyzoo fan\u2014but since I did, it\u2019s been in heavy rotation. Skyzoo, as any hip-hop head will tell you, is a noted lyricist in the \u201990s tradition. He\u2019s got solid wordplay, substance, weaves in and out of bars effortlessly, rides the beats well\u2014basically everything you could ask for in a lyricist you get in Skyzoo.\n\nAnd until now, I\u2019ve never made it through an entire project of his. I\u2019m aware of them all. Because I\u2019m a hip-hop head, every time one of his projects drops, somebody asks me for my opinion on it. And I almost always give the same response: It\u2019s cool, but not really my bag. Put a pin in this.\n\n\n\nIt turns out that I\u2019m a meat-and-potatoes guy about my hip-hop. What that means is this: If the production isn\u2019t good or if you\u2019re not a good performer of the art, I don\u2019t care how good a lyricist you are; I can\u2019t critically consume it. Shit, I can barely listen to what you have to say. It\u2019s why I\u2019ve always struggled with Lupe Fiasco and even Black Thought\u2014two of the best lyricists to ever do it, but I\u2019m not invested in their catalogs, though I love the Roots for what they do, and they are responsible for some of my favorite hip-hop creations: specifically, \u201cAct Too (Love of My Life),\u201d which is EASILY one of the best pieces of music, regardless of genre, ever composed.\n\nMy favorite rapper is Jay-Z. My favorite hip-hop album has long been De La Soul\u2019s De La Soul Is Dead, but I think I might have to change that to A Tribe Called Quest\u2019s Midnight Marauders. N.W.A.\u2014in all of their problematic glory\u2014have long been my favorite rap group, though Outkast is right in there at 1a. As you can see, my tendencies skew toward the \u201990s. My top five will almost always feature Biggie, Jay, Nas, Andr\u00e9 3000 and Ice Cube the Rapper before he died in the early \u201990s and was reborn as Ice Cube the Guy Gettin\u2019 Those Checks.\n\n\n\nIn that same vein, I also do think that Tupac is one of the greatest to ever do it. Was he one of the best technical rappers ever? No. Best lyricists ever? No. But did he perform rap on record better than almost anybody else? Absolutely. Tupac made you feel what he was saying in ways that folks like Scarface and Ice Cube did, though Cube\u2019s pen game was clearly on a hundred, thousand, trillion. Tupac, though, wasn\u2019t a bad rapper at all. He had tremendous skill and was better at maximizing his strengths than almost any other rapper. But his performance on the microphone stands out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy favorite rap song is Pete Rock and CL Smooth\u2019s \u201cThey Reminisce Over You (T.R.O.Y.),\u201d which for my money is the best rap song ever created. Which is interesting because CL Smooth would make not ONE single person\u2019s list\u2014outside of his family\u2019s\u2014of top 10, 20, even top 50 best rappers to ever do it. In fact, the only reason most of us know CL Smooth is because of the production he rapped over.\n\nIf Pete Rock weren\u2019t one of the greatest producers of all time, CL Smooth would be any other rapper from New York whose time came and went. And he\u2019s not a terrible rapper; he\u2019s just not great, either. Yet I know entire CL Smooth verses, and he sounded perfect over Pete\u2019s production. His voice is distinct and powerful. The marriage of the two artists made some of the best hip-hop of the \u201990s. So much so that I\u2019m super pissed that their album The Main Ingredient is unavailable on streaming services. Somebody needs to make a call.\n\nDespite the fact that I name-checked De La Soul Is Dead and Midnight Marauders (and honestly, you could throw Dr. Dre\u2019s The Chronic, Ice Cube\u2019s Death Certificate and Jay-Z\u2019s Reasonable Doubt in there to round out my top five), DJ Shadow\u2019s Endtroducing... (1996), RJD2\u2019s Deadringer (2002) and Dilla\u2019s Donuts (2006) are the three albums that resonate most deeply with me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe most telling part is that they\u2019re almost entirely instrumental hip-hop albums. RJD2\u2019s \u201cJune\u201d is particularly compelling as a piece of work. But they\u2019re producer-showcase albums where Shadow, RJD2 and Dilla spread their wings and do their things. DJ Shadow\u2019s song \u201cBuilding Steam With a Grain of Salt\u201d changed all kinds of shit for me. It even influenced the way I approached production and my own attempts at hip-hop artistry to this day.\n\nBut that highlights my struggle: Without a solid backing of music, it is very difficult for me to dig into what\u2019s being presented vocally, ESPECIALLY if you\u2019re a super technically proficient rapper who just happens to have a fairly droning voice. It\u2019s the Nas paradox\u2014one of the greatest to ever do it, top five dead or alive, known for trash beat selection, but he gets a pass because he\u2019s Nas and released Illmatic. Because of Illmatic (and to a lesser extent It Was Written), I have to listen to people tell me that even though his beats suck often, I should push past because the God MC is spitting that knowledge. Which, yeah, not always, boo.\n\nThis brings me back to Skyzoo, an artist I\u2019ve never listened to that heavily. After In Celebration of Us came out, because of how much I loved it, I had to ask myself what went wrong. I\u2019m aware of Skyzoo and have listened to his projects in parts, so what gives? I revisited several of his projects, and the same problem always resurfaced\u2014I didn\u2019t love the beat selection, even though I can hear the skill. None of it is bad; it just fades into the beats and background at times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, I think he\u2019s got a very, very solid understanding of what works best for him. But most of it didn\u2019t draw me in because unlike rappers like Tupac or Ludacris or Scarface, whose voices and lyrical performances are super instrumental in their craftsmanship, he gets lost.\n\nMeanwhile, when I first pulled up \u201cEverything\u2019s Fine\u201d on In Celebration of Us, I INSTANTLY got invested when he started spitting. I was and am able to dig into the project because he picked some awesome beats to supplement his lyricism, even if he was the same solid Skyzoo he\u2019s always been, drawing it to the top of the beat for the first time in my listening experience.\n\nHell, it\u2019s the very reason that so many people from the \u201990s are familiar with and swear by Group Home\u2019s Livin\u2019 Proof album, and with all due respect, there\u2019s no reason to ever know Lil Dap or Melachi the Nutcracker. Melachi is so bad, he had Dap sounding like Nas. DJ Premier\u2019s production was SO good on that album that I can listen to it despite lyrics like this:\n\nYo, I rock on the block with the real hip-hop/As you start to clock ... and jock/Yo, I\u2019m coming off with mad rage/Eighteen, and hitting the real stage/But don\u2019t worry \u2019bout me, \u2019cause I\u2019m making it/And if I can\u2019t have it, then I\u2019m taking it/That\u2019s how it is, \u2019cause I\u2019m living trife/Where\u2019s my knife? Take a chance with your life/Rappers decapitate, and disintegrate/You I will mutilate, when I penetrate/Go for the one when I say raid/A hitman for hire and I wanna get paid/\u2019Cause bullets are sprayed and anybody is laid/More money is made and that\u2019s the family trade/See, I make moves and tell what\u2019s the truth/That\u2019s why I\u2019m here, to be living proof\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s Melachi\u2019s verse on the title track, \u201cLivin\u2019 Proof.\u201d Where\u2019s Offset when you need him? And if you think that verse is better than any verse any Migo(s) has spit, you should stick a quarter in your ass \u2019cause you played yourself.\n\nSkyzoo has always been a great rapper like Royce, Elzhi, etc. Always. And after revisiting previous projects, this album had the music that resonated the most with me. It only helps that the execution of the project is top-notch.\n\nI acknowledge that lyrics are the bedrock of rap music, so ultimately as a fan and consumer, I try my best to dig into the lyricism, but when you\u2019re largely a rapper\u2019s rapper, it\u2019s easy to get lost on a record. I can understand people who are able to focus on lyrics over bad beats for the sake of artistry. But songs are not just lyrics; songs are beats and rhymes. And I need the beats and performance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m too big a fan of music to ignore a less-than-decent beat for the sake of some extremely talented lyricism. My mind is not set up that way. I want to feel what\u2019s happening, and the beats are often the entryway. And to be fair, it\u2019s why Tupac was a hard sell for many until Me Against the World. All Eyez on Me and The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory both have extremely solid production and are therefore much easier to consume and digest because Tupac performed the hell out of his records.\n\nThink about this: One of the big controversies Drake was involved in was that on his album If You\u2019re Reading This It\u2019s Too Late, he had writers. Quentin Miller is credited for several of the records, and reference vocal tracks surfaced with him performing the songs word for word. And they sucked. He sucked on them. Drake takes the same shit, Drakes them with the exact same words, and all of a sudden you have hits. The performance makes all the difference. It\u2019s indisputable. For me, performance and production are how I listen to hip-hop. Lyrics are important, but I can\u2019t just forgo the rest.\n\nHow do you listen to your hip-hop?", "keywords": ["listen", "rapper", "production", "im", "best", "hiphop", "beats", "skyzoo", "tupac", "album"], "polarity": 0.2334303142744702, "subjectivity": 0.5255721875527068},

(If you haven\u2019t already, join The Glow Up Facebook group to participate in a live red-carpet roundup with us at 6:45 p.m. EST.)\n\nBut in a season full of honors and awards shows, we have a special place in our hearts for the one with an independent streak. On Saturday the stars came out to celebrate the 33rd Annual Independent Spirit Awards in Santa Monica, Calif. And we didn\u2019t come away disappointed.\n\nAs its name suggests, the Independent Spirit Awards honor the best independent films of each year. The ceremony is presented by the organization Film Independent and traditionally takes place the day before the Academy Awards.\n\nOf course, as independent films have gained greater prominence in the mainstream in recent years, there has been increasing crossover between the nominees of the two events. But what keeps the Independent Spirit Awards so relevant and refreshing is seeing some of our faves get the recognition they deserve.\n\nFor instance, the big winner yesterday was director and writer Jordan Peele, who won in both the Best Director and Best Picture categories for his brilliant breakout hit, Get Out\u2014and was presented his awards by actor Chadwick Boseman and legendary director Spike Lee, respectively. We can only hope that his winning streak follows him to the Academy Awards Sunday night; but even if it doesn\u2019t, it was gratifying to see our favorite film of 2017 get the respect it deserved.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Tommaso Boddi (Getty Images)\n\nAnother big honor was given to director Dee Rees and the cast and crew of Mudbound, who were awarded the Robert Altman Award for a remarkable ensemble cast, director and casting director.

This month saw the debut of a web seminar on the same subject, offered by Prof. Tananarive Due and her husband, author Steven Barnes.\n\n\n\nWhen I spoke to Due and Barnes on Skype two weeks ago, they said that the idea for the Sunken Place webinar came from the overwhelming response to the UCLA course. \u201cThe highest number I\u2019ve ever had in [my] Afrofuturism [class] was about 30. And that was a lot of students,\u201d said Due. \u201cI had 60 in my first quarter for Sunken Place, and I have 60 again. They\u2019ve given us a bigger room, in fact.\u201d\n\nThe media coverage of the class, Due explained, led to many students who wanted to take the class, but couldn\u2019t get in (even before they knew Peele himself would stop by). \u201cSo now, it\u2019s crazy and so many people have said, \u2018Oh, I wish I could take that class,\u2019\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd we teach classes through webinar, and have for years, and it\u2019s just suddenly like, \u2018Well, wait a minute \u2014 why don\u2019t we just offer this class online?\u2019\n\nAs Due mentioned, Peele did wind up showing up to her course after it debuted last fall, in a surprise appearance that made students go crazy.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe act of sneaking Peele in involved showing his movie. \u201cThe way I kept them distracted before sneaking Jordan into the room was showing the clip where Rose says, \u2018You know I can\u2019t give you these keys, babe,\u2019\u201d says Due. \u201cThat scene where you realize he has no allies in the house? They had had an extensive discussion about that\u2014and the messaging in the film around the complicity of white women\u2014in the previous class. So, I knew if I put that clip on, we could have an earthquake and they wouldn\u2019t notice.\u201d\n\nBarnes, who was there as well, chimed in with more details: \u201cThere were two doors. And we snuck him in through the back door, we had a seat reserved for him, but he\u2019s wearing the hoodie and a baseball cap and he\u2019s kind of hunched down.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAfter I brought the lights up, I said, \u2018Okay\u2014what did you think the director was trying to say about the coveting of black bodies?\u2019\u201d Due continued. \u201cAnd he raises his hand in the back, and he\u2019s like, \u2018I have a question.\u2019 And he stood up, walked to the front of the room, and the class, in waves, just went crazy.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOne student ran out of the classroom, sobbing,\u201d Barnes said. Says Due, \u201cI was like, \u2018Where is she going?\u2019 And she was just going to the hall to walk it off and get herself re-centered so she could come back. And what was fantastic about it, was that I really got the sense that it wasn\u2019t just \u2018Jordan Peele from Key & Peele\u2019 kind of love he was getting. It was \u2018this is the creator of this masterwork we have been studying.\u2019 I mean, they totally got that.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOne student ran out of the classroom, sobbing!\u201d\n\nIn a similar way, Get Out\u2019s impact has rippled all over the world in the months since its release. \u201cThere are conversations that are happening now in 2018 concerning race that have never been happening in the history of this country, thanks to Get Out,\u201d Barnes observed. \u201cThere is an opening for artists right now. If you\u2019re willing to speak a dangerous truth, and you\u2019ve got the skill to do it right, there is real opportunity.\u201d\n\nPart of why Get Out resonates so much is because it gets at what\u2019s been called America\u2019s birth defect, which is to say the slave trade and its legacies. \u201cPolitics are the way you actualize or mobilize philosophy. You know, the question\u2014the core questions of philosophy are, \u2018Who am I?\u2019, \u2018What is true?\u2019, and \u2018What is the basic nature of mankind?\u2019\u201d Barnes offers. \u201cAnd in race in America, the basic question was, \u2018Who are we? What are we?\u2019 In other words, does nature trump nurture? Does essence precede existence?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSlavery was based upon the assumption of inferiority,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe emancipation did not say black people were equal. The emancipation said we should not treat these poor people this badly. We\u2019re still dealing with that question of inferiority. I think that up until 1970, and the Voting Rights Act, we were not even full citizens in America. That was when the conversation really began to turn towards, \u2018Are we actually equal? What are the implications of that?\u2019 and, \u2018How much guilt do we need to feel as a nation about the way they\u2019ve been treated if they\u2019re actually equal?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat Get Out does,\u201d Due said, \u201cis allegorically document white supremacy and its effects on black Americans. It\u2019s from slavery\u2014metaphorically, you can look at that\u2014Jordan Peele talked about the sunken place about being an interpretation of mass incarceration. But I think you can also extrapolate slavery. The theft of black bodies for labor. In this case, it was the theft of black bodies just to enhance their lives.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that though Due is still teaching it, the online version of the course is not affiliated with UCLA\u2014and there are no exams or graded essays, either. \u201cThere is homework that we will expect students to keep up with,\u201d she says, \u201cbut why take the class if you\u2019re not going to do the homework, right?\u201d Homework largely consists of watching a roster of films. \u201cInstead of one film a week, like I had my UCLA students do, online they\u2019ll be doing more like two films a week,\u201d she notes. The reading portion is mostly made up of short stories. \u201cIt\u2019s an overview course, where the lynchpin is Get Out. Because Get Out\u2014not only because of its success\u2014gives us a common point of conversation, and encompasses to much of what I call the black horror aesthetic. Which is using that allegory as a way of processing everything from slavery, to white supremacy and whatever racialized trauma.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI talked to Due and Barnes weeks ago, after Get Out got shut out at the 2018 Golden Globes, and asked them I asked them what they thought the prospects of an Oscar nomination were. They were optimistic and they also ended up being right:\n\nTananarive Due: I really believe very strongly that Get Out will get, not one, but at least a couple Oscar nominations. I would be shocked if it doesn\u2019t get a Best Original Screenplay. Steven Barnes: I would say that that\u2019s pretty close to a lock. Due: And aside from that, there\u2019s talk of Best Picture. There\u2019s talk of Daniel Kaluuya as Best Lead Actor. So there may be some other nominations. I don\u2019t know how to explain exactly what happened at the Golden Globes. First of all, let me preface it this way \u2014 I don\u2019t know how significant the Golden Globes are as a forecast of the Oscars. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s helpful. And I know it probably can\u2019t hurt. But the voting base is so different. I mean \u2014 can you really think its more important when you look at Writers Guild Awards, and stuff like that.\n\n\u2018But having said that, I\u2019m sure everyone would have loved it if the film had won, or if Daniel Kaluuya had won. Um... it\u2019s tough. Their categorization process is awkward? So that might be some of it. I saw a lot of people obviously will assume it\u2019s sort of a racial shut out, because people don\u2019t want to look at the things that Get Out put out in people\u2019s faces. There may be some truth to that. Or maybe an aversion to even seeing the film, because you can see from the trailer, \u201cOh, this might make me uncomfortable.\u201d You know? In fact, I think I said that to someone at a party. Barnes: I think its possible to look at it in at least two different ways \u2014 one is simply the practical way of how a single film doesn\u2019t give us enough data to know whether or not it\u2019s lost. But it\u2019s also possible to look into the framework of a history of films of certain political points of view being excluded or discounted. Or psychologically, black people understand that movie on a different level. Actually, there was one guy who was just going on, \u201cwhoever did this movie has no idea about race relations in America\u201d. You know? Just a white guy who thinks he understands what he doesn\u2019t understand. The Dunning-Kruger effect. Ignorance masquerading as wisdom. That we get what Jordan Peele was doing to the point where, whatever qualities are in that film, it is lifted up by our understanding of the truth that is being given to us. It\u2019s like we look at this movie, and \u201cOh my God,\u201d someone is speaking the unspeakable. This isn\u2019t a joke.\n\nDue: Someone said it. But this also the thing\u2014besides the racial possible handicap\u2014it\u2019s also a horror film. And as someone tweeted...I wish I could cite the tweet I saw earlier...where some guy was saying, \u201cOh, those of you who are upset about Get Out being shut out of the Oscars, welcome to being a horror fan.\u201d So there are a lot of people who will not take horror films seriously.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(Get Out received four nominations: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Actor. The Oscars are on March 4.)\n\nElaborating on the specifics of the online seminar, Due says they\u2019re hoping to get Peele and Candyman lead actor Tony Todd to appear as they did in the UCLA class. \u201cBut it\u2019s more lecture and discussion-based than special guest-based at this point,\u201d Due says. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly lectures and deep dives into the themes of not only Get Out, but also Candyman, Ganja and Hess\u2014that movie\u2019s take on the vampire mythos\u2014and Beloved.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhen asked who might be the ideal people to take the Sunken Place seminar, Barnes singled out three populations. \u201cOne is just the fans who want to understand and have a wider context and deeper understanding of the roots of horror, black horror in America, and our transition from being the monsters in Birth of a Nation to being the ones who fight the monsters. That\u2019s an amazing, heroic journey that we have taken in this country,\u201d he began. \u201cWe also want to be a resource for teachers of black horror to provide them with context, to deepen them, so that they can in turn reach out and touch other people. But also, we want to impact the next generation of the creators of black horror.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI really do think horror is significant socially, period, and has a way of providing a lens that few other kinds of art can. Black horror in particular is especially powerful that way. And I want to spread it like a virus.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all stand on giants,\u201d Barnes said. \u201cBut someone like Jordan Peele has created very broad shoulders, indeed. And so if we understand what he has done\u2014and what some of these other people have done, like what Tony Todd says about the way he approached the acting in Candyman, and what this means to him\u2014it changes things. You\u2019re no longer looking at the surface of the question, now you\u2019re looking underneath. You\u2019re popping up the hood and looking at the actual engine that makes that car work. Most people are just looking at the finish, the color, the paint. Let\u2019s look at the power train. How this works. Why this works. How this can be something that is a transformative experience, culturally. That\u2019s different.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI really do think horror is significant socially, period, and has a way of providing a lens that few other kinds of art can,\u201d said Due. \u201cBlack horror in particular is especially powerful that way. And I want to spread it like a virus. One of the things that was most exciting to me about the UCLA course was that I gave my students the opportunity to write either an essay, or a short story, or make a short film. And in the past, I\u2019ve never had anyone make a film. A few people have written stories. This past year, I got several stories. I got two excellent films. And it just showed me, when you open that door of enlightenment and teach students how to take the feelings that they already have, but express them through horror, boom, we\u2019re ready to go.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDue said she and Barnes want to help create artists. \u201cThat\u2019s a big part of what we want to do, and who we are. So, while it\u2019s more of an academically-oriented course, I hope that through that better intellectual understanding of the material, it will help artists open up their imaginations about how they can take their truth\u2014like Jordan Peele took his truth\u2014and create art with social impact.\u201d\n\n\n\nTo find out how to register for the \u201cThe Sunken Place\u201d web seminar, go here.", "keywords": ["class", "know", "think", "version", "college", "online", "inspired", "way", "film", "horror", "black", "course", "barnes", "students", "peele", "anybody"], "polarity": 0.10579354851906406, "subjectivity": 0.4737300564555716},

It was an adorable gimmick, and enough to raise the question: Is Cross Colours due for a comeback?\n\nLaunched in 1989 by Carl Jones and T.J. Walker, the black-owned urban-streetwear label marketed itself as \u201cclothing without prejudice\u201d and was a perfect fit for the era of new jack swing, a Fresh Prince and \u201chappy\u201d hip-hop\u2014not to mention how well the clothing coordinated with our African medallions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDistinguished by boxy silhouettes\u2014worn intentionally even more oversized, of course\u2014Cross Colours\u2019 trademark bright-hued schemes were initially inspired by a swatch of kente cloth, as Walker told Bobby Kim\u2019s The Hundreds magazine in 2014:\n\nIt elevated into a lifestyle, a collection, a look, a style. It morphed. ... For us, the colors were not only for the people, but for the fabric, for the thread, for the united force of people. Gang violence was also very prevalent at that time. So then we said Cross Colours for all that too \u2013 to unite the colors of the gangs.\n\nThe brand was a hit, dominating the early-\u201990s urban-fashion landscape, and seen on everyone from Muhammad Ali to Paula Abdul. And then, just as quickly as it peaked, it fell, due in large part to its affiliation with Merry-Go-Round\u2014one of the era\u2019s premier fast-fashion retailers\u2014which declared bankruptcy and defaulted upon millions of dollars in orders from Cross Colours in the process.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe downward spiral would continue as trademarks changed hands; eventually leading the brand to become dormant for the next two decades.\n\nBut if Cross Colours\u2019 appearance on the Grammy stage came as a surprise to most, it\u2019s only because Walker and Jones have taken a tactical approach to quietly rebuilding their brand, beginning to harness the power of social media several years ago to gauge the interest of, and access to, a new generation, as they told Kim in 2014:\n\nWe\u2019re trying to sort out how we really want to present ourselves. ... Is it all vintage? Do we have better pricing? Higher pricing? So we\u2019re going through that \u2013 the motions right now. And what do we really mean to the consumer today? It\u2019s a younger, different generation. Do they know our brand? So we start with a little bit of Instagram and now we have 5,000 followers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat following is now over 25,000\u2014and rising since Sunday night. [Editor\u2019s note: As of press time, we are still awaiting comment from Cross Colours.]\n\nBut while Bruno Mars and Co. rocked the classic baseball jerseys and bucket hats that Gen X instantly waxed nostalgic over, a visit to the Cross Colours site offers a refreshing update on the aesthetic, in addition to \u201cretro reissues\u201d\u2014where there was not an orange jersey in sight. Military-inspired looks and message T-shirts are in abundance, as well as a surprisingly sexy underwear line perfectly made for peeking out of the waistband of your saggy jeans.\n\nAnd while we\u2019re not sure we\u2019re ready to rock rainbow stripes again (sorry, Cardi), we have to admit that just seeing the brand back in action takes us back to a happier time and place.

Either way, there could be no doubt in anyone's mind that, whether you personally believe Beyonce merits this type of reverence and attention, we were watching the person considered by the people in the room to be The Most Important Person In The Room.\n\nThis is a status Beyonce has possessed since the surprise December 2013 release of Beyonce and cemented last year with Lemonade. Of course, there are those who've attempted to qualify her position as one that only exists within some sort of Black American (and specifically Black female American) bubble; citing other artists who perhaps match or surpass her in album sales, touring revenue, and critical hardware \u2014 a tired and transparently racist effort to somehow minimize the fact that the music industry's HNIC is 1) a Black woman and 2) a Black woman whose art, while racially transcendent, is speaking directly to and created specifically for Black women.\n\nThere can also be no rational doubt that Lemonade \u2014 the biggest and most ambitious album from the world's biggest artist \u2014 dominated 2016. And its sovereignty didn't just extend to the airwaves. Its extended and mysterious rollout, the paralyzation of time that occurred when it debuted, the visual art accompanying it, the conversations and conspiracy theories spawned from it, the critical assessments of it (and the conversations about who was \"allowed\" to even assess it), the myriad interpretations of its lyrics, themes, and imagery \u2014 its cultural supremacy was total. Shit, there are fucking syllabi devoted to both understanding Lemonade's context and using it as a springboard for an education on womanism.\n\nAnd it losing out to Adele's 25 \u2014 a nice and decent and popular album from a nice and decent and popular woman \u2014 last night was a message:\n\n\"Your best doesn't matter here\"\n\nPerhaps this message was unintentional. Maybe they just believed that 25 was just better. A better representative of the year in music. A bigger success. A more important album. But even a lack of malicious intent does nothing but reinforce the concept of pervasive invisibility. That we could be on their stage, defying gravity and time and age and common sense while waving our pregnant-as-fuck bellies in their faces \u2014 with our cute-ass-fuck babies serving as our impromptu hype men \u2014 and they still don't see us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo her credit, Adele did what she could to acknowledge this invisibility in her acceptance speech. (And, for the record, I get why people may have been turned off by that. But isn't this exactly what we ask White people who claim to be friends and allies to do? To acknowledge their privilege and use their status and position to call out other White people? Perhaps she didn't communicate it as best she could, but those types of heartfelt appreciations \u2014 particularly ones existing in a cultural and racial minefield \u2014 are rarely perfect. I'm not sure what else she could have done or said.) But it's little consolation for the inescapable reality of the moment.\n\nNaturally, there are going to be people who'll use this as more proof of why we (Black people) need to stop depending on the Grammys and the Oscars and the Emmys and other similar types of awarding for validation \u2014 a predictable ask for self-empowerment that seems logical but is inherently faulty. Because its recognition, not validation, that is sought. Validation exists to fill an internal deficit. Recognition is ultimately just desiring a level playing field and concretized rules that apply to everyone and make sense. In this context, it's demanding that White people somehow remove their goggles of Whiteness and allow themselves to see what's right in front of their fucking faces. Not just for our sake, or even their's specifically, but just so they'll maybe possibly finally get things right.", "keywords": ["know", "type", "lemonade", "didnt", "types", "white", "dont", "specifically", "black", "beyonce", "watch", "album", "validation", "win", "woman"], "polarity": 0.09833733617980193, "subjectivity": 0.5034518373559469},

The Oscars are Sunday night, and just like Issa Rae, we\u2019re \u201crooting for everybody black.\u201d Here\u2019s a breakdown of the black contenders for the gold in this year\u2019s major categories.\n\nBest Actor\n\nDaniel Kaluuya: Get Out\n\nScreenshot: Universal Pictures\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe news of Daniel Kaluuya\u2019s nomination for his portrayal of Chris Washington in Get Out came as very little surprise to anyone who watched the movie, helping it to reach its $255 million box-office figure. The satire/horror film was both a critical and financial success, leading to speculation that he could walk away with Oscar gold.\n\nCould he win? Nah, fam. Get Out gives white people the heebie-jeebies. His odds of winning are as bad as the odds of a black guy making it to the end of most horror movies. I know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cBut Get Out is not a horror movie. It\u2019s a documentary.\u201d\n\nDenzel Washington: Roman J. Israel, Esq.\n\nScreenshot: Columbia Pictures\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlong with Kaluuya, Denzel Washington, a perennial favorite, is helping to buoy the nominations for blacks this year in the Best Actor category. Washington portrays the titular legal persona, Roman J. Israel, with drama and humor.\n\nCould he win? Unfortunately, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences doesn\u2019t appreciate black people doing comedy. Or drama. Or anything. Plus, the movie was neither a critical darling nor a financial success. He should be happy just to be nominated.\n\nAnalysis: Over the last decade, the award in this category has often gone to actors playing white dudes amid historical periods, like Daniel Day-Lewis (who is also nominated this year), for his roles in There Will Be Blood and Lincoln; Sean Penn in Milk; and Eddie Redmayne for his portrayal of Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything. The closest nonhistorical portrayals to Washington\u2019s role among recent winners are probably Matthew McConaughey in Dallas Buyers Club and Jeff Bridges in Crazy Heart. The precedent set by these two wins arguably gives Washington the better shot of the two black actors this year. But this means his performance will have to get more votes than two in movies that are both notably historical and dramatic: Gary Oldman in Darkest Hour and Daniel Day-Lewis in Phantom Thread.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNote: There are no black nominees for best actress or best supporting actor this year.\n\n\n\nBest Supporting Actress\n\n\n\nOctavia Spencer: The Shape of Water\n\nScreenshot: Fox Searchlight\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOctavia Spencer snagged a nomination for her role in The Shape of Water this year, making her the first black actress to be nominated two years in a row. She also now ties Viola Davis for Oscar nominations with three.\n\nCould she win? Spencer has a slight chance because of her pedigree and the fact that there is no clear-cut favorite in the category.\n\nMary J. Blige: Mudbound\n\nScreenshot: Armory Films\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMary J. Blige surprised everyone with her understated portrayal in Mudbound and could be the first actress to win an award for a movie released on a streaming service (Netflix), which might undercut the boycott of that service by a previous black Academy Award winner, Mo\u2019Nique.\n\nCould she win? Possibly. Academy voters love newcomers like Jennifer Hudson, who gave a star turn in Dreamgirls. Even though Spencer might split the small black vote with Blige, a lot of liberal Oscar voters like the song \u201cReal Love.\u201d\n\nAnalysis: Looking at history to predict the future in this category seems to give even odds to most of the actresses in the category this year. Some might consider Spencer\u2019s recent win for Hidden Figures to be a potential handicap, however, considering that the academy might not want to hand her the award after a previous win and back-to-back nominations. Also, Spencer gets her nomination from a science fiction movie, a genre mostly honored at the Oscars in more technical categories, like sound editing and visual effects.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBest Director\n\nJordan Peele: Get Out\n\nScreenshot: NBC Universal\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJordan Peele, for Get Out, represents the only black entry among this year\u2019s Best Director nominees.\n\nCould he win? Looking at the past decade, Peele\u2019s best hope for a win lies in the winning precedent of drama and grit, set by films like Slumdog Millionaire, The Hurt Locker and Birdman, as opposed to the cinematic eye candy displayed by films like Gravity and The Revenant. But in the year of #MeToo, Peele\u2019s chances may also be undercut by Greta Gerwig, the only female nominee in the category, nominated for Lady Bird.\n\nBest Picture\n\nJordan Peele: Get Out\n\nGet Out, represented in five categories this year, has a tough run to complete in order to pick up the win for Best Picture.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCould he win? First off, it\u2019s an off year for #OscarsSoWhite guilt. That is to say, last year\u2019s win by Moonlight in the category might offer the academy slight relief from the social pressure to take Get Out so seriously. Also, Get Out is fighting an uphill battle against a grouping of four historical films out of the nine Best Picture nominees this year: Darkest Hour, Dunkirk (both World War II films), Phantom Thread and The Post. Historical films account for about half the winners over the last decade in this category.\n\n\n\nOne factor that gives some hope is that many times, the Best Director and Best Picture categories are closely related; about half the time, the film that wins one award wins both.\n\nWith an academy that\u2019s over 90 percent white and over 70 percent male, winning it over seems to be a daunting task for our nominees in a lot of these categories. It\u2019s not surprising to see wins that heavily favor white, male-centric nominees even in categories that aren\u2019t gender-specific\u2014thus #OscarsSoWhite.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Oscars air on March 4, should you choose to watch, with black fist held high, rooting for black excellence to shine.\n\n", "keywords": ["categories", "washington", "best", "handicapping", "films", "nominees", "oscar", "rooting", "spencer", "black", "movie", "everybody", "academy", "win", "category"], "polarity": 0.2255360422405878, "subjectivity": 0.3797382920110191},

But I also I knew that at this point, the structure of the film, it needed to take us on a ride because it\u2019s the horror genre. I wrote this scene in a very vulnerable state. I put my worst fears out there and onto the page, and when I was finished writing that scene, the experience of writing this movie changed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI realized what this movie was about.

I have Google Play, so I can easily find what I like. My concern lies more in how much the discussion and debate around the culture have changed and\u2014in my not-so-humble opinion\u2014devolved.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe rivalry between the nostalgic fans of old-school rappers and the new-school up-and-comers (or, as I call them, \u201cTeam: Art is subjective\u201d) can get downright sitcom-ish at times.\n\n\n\nFrom Anderson .Paak scolding Lil Yachty\u2019s non-Tupac-and-Biggie-knowing-face-ass about learning and respecting hip-hop\u2019s lineage, to Pete Rock wanting to smack fire out of Waka Flocka for claiming to be the new Nas and Jay-Z (Pete got that arthritis and shit, so he just wrote an angry Instagram post instead), to the infamous Joe Budden-vs- Migos standoff, to 21 Savage calling out \u201cOG Rappers\u201d for judging the new generation, everyone seems to be in a perpetual state of social media warfare over the current state of hip-hop.\n\nI get it: All the big, bad Joe Buddens of the world need to stop huffing and puffing and blowing up everyone\u2019s spot while pining away for some long-lost golden era of hip-hop. #TeamArtIsSubjective and their fan base are vocal about their desire for us old-school critics to give the youngins room to create and allow hip-hop to have subgenres like all other music. Lil Yachty said, in an interview with The Guardian: \u201cOlder hip-hop people, they don\u2019t understand evolution, or just don\u2019t want it. One of the two.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s the thing that\u2019s hard for an old head like myself to admit: They\u2019re right (well, the Yachty quote is debatable, but ... whatever).\n\nIf you\u2019re still saying, \u201cThat ain\u2019t real hip-hop!\u201d you need to return your whole narrative to 2004 and go find yourself a cave to go cry in.

Some things aren\u2019t subjective. 2 Chainz will never be 2Pac, just like Tyler Perry will never be James Baldwin. I don\u2019t know when we got into this \u201cIf you don\u2019t have anything nice to say, don\u2019t say anything at all\u201d era of hip-hop discourse, but I\u2019m telling y\u2019all, it\u2019s for the birds. It\u2019s indicative of how a lot of us have become disconnected from the full spectrum of the culture.\n\nThe larger culture has always been critical of artists and music it determined to be inferior. It\u2019s where the phrase \u201cwack emcees\u201d comes from. If it seems disrespected, it\u2019s supposed to be. Hip-hop literally invented the word \u201cdiss.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, it is true we oldies sound the same way our parents did when they were shitting all over whatever we were listening to when we were younger. But be honest, guys: Who, in their youth, ever gave a fuck about their parents\u2019 opinion on ... well ... anything? So let\u2019s not pretend it\u2019s so damaging.\n\n(And, if we\u2019re being honest, our folks were right about a lot of shit. If you grew up in the \u201990s, you had Boyz II Men, Jodeci, En Vogue, Whitney Houston and a few others who might be able to hold their own sharing a stage with Motown\u2019s finest. Even Boyz II Men would just barely be holding the Temptations\u2019 jockstrap. But I digress.)\n\nThe truth is, this isn\u2019t purely a generational thing, as there is no era in hip-hop where purists (or real \u201cheads\u201d) weren\u2019t talking shit about commercial rap music. Ask Kool Herc and Grandmaster Caz what they thought about the Sugarhill Gang\u2019s \u201cRapper\u2019s Delight.\u201d Ask Run-DMC how many elitist assholes had something to say about their crossover collaboration with Aerosmith.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShit, I was calling out the unabashed wackness of mainstream pop rap when I was in my late teens and early 20s (meaning I was still of the current generation). We old-school hip-hoppers have always had a list as long as an MC Hammer remix of rappers from our era we absolutely despised. And none of our opinions had even the slightest impact on their bottom lines. Which leads me to a final question:\n\nWhy do you give a shit what we think?\n\nIf you\u2019re a fan of popular music, you\u2019re on the favorable side of supply and demand, so I just don\u2019t understand the degree of contempt you have for the detractors of your faves. It\u2019s like you\u2019re sitting at the popular kids\u2019 table worried about what the second-string chess club is gossiping about. Migos spent all of 2017 at the top of every pop chart in the country. You think that nigga gives a fuck how trash I think he is?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWait ... what? Migos is three people? Well, shit\n\n\u201cWe the biggest group ever. Ever. In pop, hip-hop, all that, because every genre in music right now is structured off us. We got this culture.\u201d \u2014rapper Offset of Migos\n\nHell, try being an underground head. Think how much easier our lives would\u2019ve been if we had just liked what the masses were in to. Do you know how many women I wouldn\u2019t have had to eventually cancel because they kept hopping into my car and snatching my Pharoahe Monch out of the disc drive to bump that new Ja Rule or Nelly (by the end of this piece, you should all be able to guess my age).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI grew up in Atlanta, the city where clubbing is a staple of the culture and a rite of passage, as someone with a serious distaste for Lil Jon and the Ying Yang Boys (wait ... that\u2019s not right). I was the old guy in the club when I was, like, 22.\n\nMaybe I am just an old fogy shouting at the modern rap world to get off my lawn. But I\u2019d like to think that harsh criticism among the different sects of hip-hop fandom has always been more healthy than draining, and I fail to see how it prohibits the evolution of the culture or the ability of new generations to get their shine and add their own branches to the genre tree.\n\nTruth is, subgenre has always been present in hip-hop.

The film was adapted from the 2008 Hillary Jordan novel about two families\u2014one black and one white\u2014attempting to stay afloat by sharecropping the same patch of hard Mississippi acreage in the World War II era.\n\nI won\u2019t drop any spoilers here, but Mudbound is a captivating watch\u2014the film was nominated for two Golden Globes (though it ultimately lost), and Mary J. Blige is a revelation as a matriarch. It excels in large part because of its dedication to authenticity, including how whites treated black folks (and how blacks had to treat whites in order to survive) in the Jim Crow South. The rage-whitening of your black knuckles only intensifies as the movie creeps toward its climax, and once it\u2019s done, you\u2019re left with the residue of anger at our treatment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCertain period films allow us to escape to days long past with a relative certainty that the technology, mindsets and quality of life portrayed have permanently evolved, but black Americans\u2014most of whom, at the very least, have living parents or grandparents who faced legal consequences for using the same toilet as white people\u2014aren\u2019t afforded the luxury of viewing such things passively. Mudbound is set some seven decades ago, but in a #MakeAmericaGreatAgain, tiki-torch, George Zimmerman-still-walks-as-a-free-man America that reminds you just how little shit has changed since then, it\u2019s not so easy to divorce oneself from the fact that it\u2019s just a movie.\n\nAnd really, there\u2019s a metric-ass ton of films that evoke these feelings within us. Damon Young created a list a few years back, but he only scratched the surface of what could easily be a 5,000-word article. So here\u2019s a very nonexhaustive list of films that make me kinda wanna trip Kaitlyn as she strolls out of Lululemon:\n\nDetroit (2017)\n\nAudiences pretty much steered clear of this film, which is based on the 1967 Detroit rebellion, likely because they heard that the middle hour is like a Saw film for racially motivated police brutality. Detroit is actually a decent film, and I was one of the few black reviewers who gave it praise. But after watching a press screening, I skipped out on the star-studded world premiere for the same reason I\u2019ll likely never watch the film again: because ain\u2019t nobody got time to be miserable for the rest of the afternoon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMurder in Mississippi (1990)\n\nThis made-for-TV movie starring Blair Underwood traumatized me when I was a young child with an inchoate understanding of racism. Based on the real-life murder of civil rights activists by the Ku Klux Klan in the 1960s, the film\u2019s protagonists inspired 8-year-old me before I had to watch them get dragged out of their vehicles and executed in the conclusion. They might as well have clipped Mr. Rogers in front of me. I haven\u2019t laid eyes on this film for the better part of 30 years, but it\u2019s the only reason I refused to stop for gas when driving through Mississippi at night while in my 20s.\n\n\n\nDead Presidents (1995)\n\nIt\u2019s not always the films that feature explicit white-on-black violence. Dead Presidents masterfully depicts the black American condition as it\u2019s affected by the sublimation of overt racism: Young black and brown men fight the white man\u2019s war (Vietnam here, but isn\u2019t every war the white man\u2019s war?), only to return home with addictions, illness, injuries, emotional trauma and scarce financial options. Not even the liberal use of Terrence Howard\u2019s \u201cmayne,\u201d Clifton Powell\u2019s \u201cnyuguh\u201d or the best soundtrack ever make the conclusion less depressing.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmerican History X (1998)\n\nThough it\u2019s in my top 10 all-time favorite films, this white nationalist redemption tale is never too easy to take in. Edward Norton\u2019s Derek Vinyard is a nasty Nazi bastard before eventually becoming a sympathetic character, and Stacy Keach\u2019s predatory patriarch motivating children to hate is infuriating. And of course, there\u2019s that curbside scene\u2014hit the \u201cplay\u201d button on the above video if you, too, wish to be pissed off.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPitch Perfect movies\n\nIncluded in this list because I can\u2019t think of a series that better personifies the unbridled caucasity that is the Hollywood machine than one that portrays the \u201ccompetitive\u201d world of collegiate a cappella as comedy. The industry is doing a better-than-ever job of green-lighting the stories of marginalized voices, and Moonlight getting the Oscars drop on Fluffernutter-sandwich-turned-cinematic-experience La La Land was monumental. But it\u2019s still tough to see Pitch Perfect films being made even when no one asked for them.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGet Out (2017)\n\nPretty much every white person in Jordan Peele\u2019s blockbuster is written to appall. But there\u2019s a unique animus that should be reserved for Allison Williams\u2019 Rose Armitage, the (spoiler alert) main cog in the machine of a family that subverts and \u201ctransforms\u201d black folks into modern-day slaves. I\u2019m sayin\u2019 \u2026 she should\u2019ve gotten it much worse in the end.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDjango Unchained (2012)\n\nMuch has been written about Quentin Tarantino\u2019s liberal use of the n-word in his films, but few will argue that the man can\u2019t write a good revenge tale. Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s unctuous plantation owner is impressively reprehensible as a man who forces his slaves to participate in some ungodly mixed martial arts for his amusement. But it\u2019s the scene in which dogs tear a slave to pieces that makes us root for Jamie Foxx\u2019s Django to snatch the life of every human of European descent on-screen.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSurviving the Game (1994)\n\nAn entire movie centered on rich white men (and Charles S. \u201cRoc\u201d Dutton) hunting a homeless black man for sport. Get past the action-thriller aspect of the film (which isn\u2019t too shabby for the early 1990s) and focus on the optics of Ice-T\u2019s down-on-his-luck widower thinking he\u2019s catching a break at the hands of some well-meaning white folks who are all betting on being the first to off him. It\u2019s fitting that Rutger Hauer, the poster boy for Hollywood bad guys whom you\u2019d probably steer clear of in real life, plays the main antagonist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRosewood (1997)\n\nYeah, I know Damon has this on his list. But John Singleton\u2019s best film not named Boyz n the Hood remains the gold standard of don\u2019t-bring-your-Anglo-ass-anywhere-within-10-yards-of-me-after-I-watch-this filmmaking. Based on a real-life 1920s massacre following the lie of a white woman on a black man, not many films before or since Rosewood have so unflinchingly depicted raw white brutality on black bodies.

I\u2019m here to ask for blessings for the rapper Post Malone. I know you are the creator of all things\u2014even this man who looks like the result of Pippi Longstocking fucking a semidomesticated billy goat. I read an article today about him in GQ where he was asked, \u201cDo you, Post Malone, ever feel anxious about working in a primarily black-identified genre of music?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe writer, Bijan Stephen, even noted his own feelings about Malone\u2019s hypocrisy when he wrote: \u201cI\u2019m black. I\u2019m young. I\u2019ve been put off by some of the things he\u2019s said about distancing himself from rap, from R&B, from anything, really, that\u2019s musically black-identified.\u201d\n\nStephen went on to explain: \u201cI enjoy Post\u2019s music, but I\u2019m skeptical: What\u2019s worse than appropriating a black sound without giving appropriate credit is doing that and not realizing why that might be wrong.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, Lord, you are the alpha and omega, and being that you are the only one in heaven or on earth who pledged two fraternities, I\u2019m sure you already knew this, our bright and morning star. In your omnipotence, I\u2019m sure you are aware of Post Malone\u2019s response, but Imma just type it out so the copyedit team won\u2019t ask me for the quote, Almighty One. Oh, ye Giver of Life, Death and Krispy Kreme doughnuts, Post Malone said:\n\nI definitely feel like there\u2019s a struggle being a white rapper. But I don\u2019t want to be a rapper. I just want to be a person that makes music. I make music that I like and I think that kicks ass, that I think the people who fuck with me as a person and as an artist will like.\n\nOh, Lord, I need you right now!\n\nI need you to still this slapping spirit that is rising in my heart and tingling in my palms! Quench this desire to ask, \u201cWhat the fuck did he just say?\u201d I know it ain\u2019t nothing but the devil trying to work his way into my mind like that time Satan made me renege on the spades table and I ran a Boston in the last hand and told First Lady Chambers to get her bitch ass off my table! I felt the same thing when I read that quote from Post Malone, and I need you to eject this reneging spirit from my soul, Most High!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut most of all, Big Poppa (yes, I\u2019ve heard the gospel hymn when you said you love it when we call you that), take Post Malone\u2019s hand and guide him through the misery of being a millionaire and being white. I know it must be hard for him to exist in a world where he has every societal advantage that comes with whiteness while simultaneously getting to wade in the pool of black culture.\n\nI imagine it tastes like fruit from the Tree of Knowledge of Good, Evil and White Privilege. Yea, though Post Malone walks through the valley of the shadow of cultural appropriation, comfort him with your rod and staff. Or beat him.\n\nPlease beat him.\n\nAnd forgive him, Your Highness.\n\nForgive him, for he knows not what he\u2019s doing when he makes millions from an art form created by black people while distancing himself from the individuals and the struggle that birthed the art by stiff-arming anything remotely related to blackness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nForgive him for dabbling in the outlaw-thug stereotype while not recognizing the privilege of not having every aspect of himself associated with the oppression and danger that goes along with his inverted shucking and jiving.\n\nOh, my Good & Plenty higher power, I know some will say that he is not guilty of cultural appropriation, but if hip-hop is a culture, and the definition of appropriation is \u201cthe deliberate reworking of images and styles from earlier, well-known works of art\u201d without attribution or acknowledgment, and Malone doesn\u2019t even acknowledge that he is a rapper, then I don\u2019t know what else to call him, dear Lord. A rap gentrifier? A rhyme colonialist? Motherfucker? (Forgive me for that, thou divine one.)\n\nBut most of all, ye magnificent with the sensational style, forgive Post Malone for his tone-deaf, oblivious whining about the paper-cut-deep criticism he receives for his third-grade-level lyrical, gold-front blackface as if he couldn\u2019t stop rapping tomorrow, waltz his ass back to the suburbs, and become the one thing in the world that is greater and exponentially more precious than being a young, famous, millionaire musician:\n\nA white man.\n\nIn this, and all things, we ask your blessings.\n\nAmen.", "keywords": ["know", "rapper", "lord", "im", "post", "struggle", "prayer", "white", "dont", "sure", "malone", "black"], "polarity": 0.13341600529100528, "subjectivity": 0.5150589726631394},

Far too many people have died, and a spoiled, mango-colored racist man surrounded by a bunch of like-minded bigots and sycophants will soon make life hell for many who have survived. However, as draining as this year has felt for many, there are plenty of bright spots to behold. Here, I recap some of my favorite winners of 2016.\n\n\n\nBeyonc\u00e9\n\nTechnically, Beyonc\u00e9 wins every damn year of her wonderful life, but in 2016 she gave us a show-stealing performance at the Super Bowl; released an illuminating visual film for her phenomenal latest album, Lemonade; had an incredible tour; gave one brilliant performance after another on awards shows like the VMAs, the CMAs and the BET Awards; tried to save this country from its stupid self by endorsing Hillary Clinton for president; and continued to be gloriously country, black, Houston and all-around better than her peers. I\u2019m always bowing down.\n\n\n\nRihanna\n\nThe initial singles in 2015 were not up to the standard she has set, and the release delays felt painful, but finally, Anti arrived and was Rihanna\u2019s greatest album. And while some may have made snide remarks over her deal with Samsung that led to her giving away 1 million copies for free, that\u2019s $25 million more than they have. Besides, if you turn on the radio, that Rihanna reign still won\u2019t let up.\n\n\n\nFrank Ocean\n\nThe singer-songwriter seemingly loves reclusion as much as he does an ole nasty somber song. Yet, close to a year after he initially promised fans new material, Ocean finally delivered on his promise with not one, but two works. The first was Endless, a visual album that turned out to be his way of fulfilling his contractual obligations with his former label, and then came Blonde, which he released independently. Not only does Ocean enjoy complete artistic freedom, but he is now more than ever getting to the \u201cmu-mu-muny/yen and the pesos.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichelle Obama\n\nAlthough her work did not lend itself to the result she intended, the first lady was by far the greatest political surrogate of the election season. Obama advocated for Hillary Clinton in ways that were superior to those of everyone else\u2014including Clinton herself. Moreover, Obama was able to condemn Donald Trump and all of his despicable ways without even uttering his name. Typically not one to shy away from public beef, even Honeysuckle Lenin didn\u2019t dare come for the neck of FLOTUS. When asked about the election results, Obama didn\u2019t say much but made one thing clear: She meant everything she said.\n\nOf all things to miss about our current administration, I will miss Michelle Obama most. She has been a winner every year, but history will look kindly on this one, for many reasons.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIssa Rae\n\nFans of the Los Angeles-based gem have long known of her genius from her popular Web series, The Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl, but this year, she made her long-awaited television debut with the HBO comedy Insecure, and it's bigger, brighter and more complicated than its online predecessor. Rae seized upon the opportunity and ran with it. Not only has the show resulted in a Golden Globe nomination for its star and heart, but it has also already been confirmed for a second season. Until then, many will be debating who had it right: Issa or Lawrence. The rest of us will just be happy Issa knocked it out with the show.\n\n\n\nDonald Glover\n\nSome of us were open-minded but nonetheless slightly skeptical about his new TV series, but Atlanta proved itself to be smart, idiosyncratic, nearly genre-boundless television that proved vital. So much nuance and layers were crammed into 10 30-minute episodes\u2014a testament to Glover\u2019s vision. Long live the South.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAva DuVernay\n\nQueen Sugar is gorgeous in its subtlety, and brilliant in its complex depiction of a contemporary black family in Louisiana. And there's DuVernay's documentary The 13th, a haunting look at mass incarceration and America\u2019s long-standing tradition of devaluing black life.\n\n\n\nSolange\n\nThere are only two real options for siblings of superstars who also function as artists: Ray J or Janet Jackson. Thankfully, Solange is more so the latter. And before you say it, no one will ever be Janet Jackson, but at the same time, very few get to step out of the shadows of their siblings and let their own light shine as brightly as their talent deserves. Solange has had her own lane for years now, but this year, with her recent and best body of work, A Seat at the Table, Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s little sis is doing big things, like landing her first No. 1 album on the Billboard 200.

The film was adapted from the 2008 Hillary Jordan novel about two families\u2014one black and one white\u2014attempting to stay afloat by sharecropping the same patch of hard Mississippi acreage in the World War II era.\n\nI won\u2019t drop any spoilers here, but Mudbound is a captivating watch\u2014the film was nominated for two Golden Globes (though it ultimately lost), and Mary J. Blige is a revelation as a matriarch. It excels in large part because of its dedication to authenticity, including how whites treated black folks (and how blacks had to treat whites in order to survive) in the Jim Crow South. The rage-whitening of your black knuckles only intensifies as the movie creeps toward its climax, and once it\u2019s done, you\u2019re left with the residue of anger at our treatment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCertain period films allow us to escape to days long past with a relative certainty that the technology, mindsets and quality of life portrayed have permanently evolved, but black Americans\u2014most of whom, at the very least, have living parents or grandparents who faced legal consequences for using the same toilet as white people\u2014aren\u2019t afforded the luxury of viewing such things passively. Mudbound is set some seven decades ago, but in a #MakeAmericaGreatAgain, tiki-torch, George Zimmerman-still-walks-as-a-free-man America that reminds you just how little shit has changed since then, it\u2019s not so easy to divorce oneself from the fact that it\u2019s just a movie.\n\nAnd really, there\u2019s a metric-ass ton of films that evoke these feelings within us. Damon Young created a list a few years back, but he only scratched the surface of what could easily be a 5,000-word article. So here\u2019s a very nonexhaustive list of films that make me kinda wanna trip Kaitlyn as she strolls out of Lululemon:\n\nDetroit (2017)\n\nAudiences pretty much steered clear of this film, which is based on the 1967 Detroit rebellion, likely because they heard that the middle hour is like a Saw film for racially motivated police brutality. Detroit is actually a decent film, and I was one of the few black reviewers who gave it praise. But after watching a press screening, I skipped out on the star-studded world premiere for the same reason I\u2019ll likely never watch the film again: because ain\u2019t nobody got time to be miserable for the rest of the afternoon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMurder in Mississippi (1990)\n\nThis made-for-TV movie starring Blair Underwood traumatized me when I was a young child with an inchoate understanding of racism. Based on the real-life murder of civil rights activists by the Ku Klux Klan in the 1960s, the film\u2019s protagonists inspired 8-year-old me before I had to watch them get dragged out of their vehicles and executed in the conclusion. They might as well have clipped Mr. Rogers in front of me. I haven\u2019t laid eyes on this film for the better part of 30 years, but it\u2019s the only reason I refused to stop for gas when driving through Mississippi at night while in my 20s.\n\n\n\nDead Presidents (1995)\n\nIt\u2019s not always the films that feature explicit white-on-black violence. Dead Presidents masterfully depicts the black American condition as it\u2019s affected by the sublimation of overt racism: Young black and brown men fight the white man\u2019s war (Vietnam here, but isn\u2019t every war the white man\u2019s war?), only to return home with addictions, illness, injuries, emotional trauma and scarce financial options. Not even the liberal use of Terrence Howard\u2019s \u201cmayne,\u201d Clifton Powell\u2019s \u201cnyuguh\u201d or the best soundtrack ever make the conclusion less depressing.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmerican History X (1998)\n\nThough it\u2019s in my top 10 all-time favorite films, this white nationalist redemption tale is never too easy to take in. Edward Norton\u2019s Derek Vinyard is a nasty Nazi bastard before eventually becoming a sympathetic character, and Stacy Keach\u2019s predatory patriarch motivating children to hate is infuriating. And of course, there\u2019s that curbside scene\u2014hit the \u201cplay\u201d button on the above video if you, too, wish to be pissed off.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPitch Perfect movies\n\nIncluded in this list because I can\u2019t think of a series that better personifies the unbridled caucasity that is the Hollywood machine than one that portrays the \u201ccompetitive\u201d world of collegiate a cappella as comedy. The industry is doing a better-than-ever job of green-lighting the stories of marginalized voices, and Moonlight getting the Oscars drop on Fluffernutter-sandwich-turned-cinematic-experience La La Land was monumental. But it\u2019s still tough to see Pitch Perfect films being made even when no one asked for them.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGet Out (2017)\n\nPretty much every white person in Jordan Peele\u2019s blockbuster is written to appall. But there\u2019s a unique animus that should be reserved for Allison Williams\u2019 Rose Armitage, the (spoiler alert) main cog in the machine of a family that subverts and \u201ctransforms\u201d black folks into modern-day slaves. I\u2019m sayin\u2019 \u2026 she should\u2019ve gotten it much worse in the end.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDjango Unchained (2012)\n\nMuch has been written about Quentin Tarantino\u2019s liberal use of the n-word in his films, but few will argue that the man can\u2019t write a good revenge tale. Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s unctuous plantation owner is impressively reprehensible as a man who forces his slaves to participate in some ungodly mixed martial arts for his amusement. But it\u2019s the scene in which dogs tear a slave to pieces that makes us root for Jamie Foxx\u2019s Django to snatch the life of every human of European descent on-screen.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSurviving the Game (1994)\n\nAn entire movie centered on rich white men (and Charles S. \u201cRoc\u201d Dutton) hunting a homeless black man for sport. Get past the action-thriller aspect of the film (which isn\u2019t too shabby for the early 1990s) and focus on the optics of Ice-T\u2019s down-on-his-luck widower thinking he\u2019s catching a break at the hands of some well-meaning white folks who are all betting on being the first to off him. It\u2019s fitting that Rutger Hauer, the poster boy for Hollywood bad guys whom you\u2019d probably steer clear of in real life, plays the main antagonist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRosewood (1997)\n\nYeah, I know Damon has this on his list. But John Singleton\u2019s best film not named Boyz n the Hood remains the gold standard of don\u2019t-bring-your-Anglo-ass-anywhere-within-10-yards-of-me-after-I-watch-this filmmaking. Based on a real-life 1920s massacre following the lie of a white woman on a black man, not many films before or since Rosewood have so unflinchingly depicted raw white brutality on black bodies.

They\u2019re the women whose names we\u2019ll never know; they are domestic workers and farmworkers.

What?! This is the true story of Margot Lee Shetterly. She is the black woman who helped bring Hidden Figures to life.\n\nHidden Figures is the amazing but previously untold story of three black female mathematicians\u2014Katherine Johnson, Mary Jackson and Dorothy Vaughan; their contributions to NASA; and pretty much their role in helping shape America's history in space exploration.\n\nThis story is not only a surefire box-office smash but also a book that was written as the movie was being produced. Shetterly is now a New York Times best-selling author, and Hidden Figures is also the No. 1 young readers book. Shetterly wondered, as we all did, how does that happen on your first book? She and I chatted on the phone, mostly gushing over her seemingly overnight success. \"It\u2019s a lightning strike \u2026 fairy dust,\" she said.\n\n\"I wrote the book I wanted to read,\" she added. \"I wanted those kinds of women protagonists\u2014strong, smart, successful, and [I wanted] to show the challenges they faced. I wanted it big and American.\"\n\nShetterly also wanted the world to see that black people are as much a part of American history as anyone. \"I didn\u2019t know how badly other people wanted it, not just black women.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd what a revelation!\n\nBefore the book was even finished, Hidden Figures producer Donna Gigliotti put it in the hands of Hollywood heavyweights and told Shetterly, \"We're going to make \u2026 a movie out of your book proposal.\" Within three years, both the book and the movie were finished.\n\nAnd now Shetterly has gone from an unknown writer to a best-seller who not only gets to be in the same room as first lady Michelle Obama but also gets to be praised by her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo what's next? How do you move up from this height as an author? Shetterly is already working on her next book, which is part of the trilogy that Hidden Figures kicks off. Can we say \u201cYay!\u201d about more black history being revealed?\n\nShetterly is obsessed with midcentury stories and wants to continue telling them. She tells me, \"The new story [I'm working on] is also unseen, but not quite untold. It deals with midcentury. Anything I will ever do in life will not be as consuming and overwhelming as Hidden Figures.\"\n\nShe's modest, which is understandable, because not everyone gets this type of love with a first book, but success can be fleeting. I'm sure, though, that Shetterly will continue to see major success so long as she's writing our stories with such care and honesty. I'm looking forward to her continued success and am just glad I get to help tell her story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWatch the interview with Shetterly:\n\n\n\n", "keywords": ["hidden", "wanted", "im", "margot", "limits", "figures", "shetterlys", "proves", "book", "success", "history", "blackgirlmagic", "knows", "lee", "shetterly", "movie", "black"], "polarity": 0.09996526107637219, "subjectivity": 0.4270936882047993},

Hyacinthe is one of the hardest-hustling creatives in New York City, crafting a hybrid career out of her two greatest passions: music and fashion. By day, the stylist and CEO of Immaculate Wardrobe dresses Fortune 500 female power brokers; by night, she\u2019s DJ Soda Pop, spinning hip-hop and house at Manhattan venues like the Museum of Sex\u2014where she launches a weekly residency tonight.\n\nThe Glow Up recently caught up with the busy Bronx-born beauty to discuss her parallel creative careers and her future as a fashion DJ. The product of what she describes as a traditional Haitian-American family, Hyacinthe grew up on a steady diet of hip-hop and haute couture, influenced by three older brothers and a style-obsessed stepsister. Her own obsession with fashion began so early, she recalls cutting out and stashing Vogue spreads under her pillowcase, just so she could wear the outfits in her dreams:\n\nI remember being in school\u2014we had to list our skills, what we were good at. And the only thing I [could] think of was that I can put clothes together nicely. ... And I remember picking up\u2014it was Vibe magazine\u2014and they used to have the fashion editorials, and I saw [celebrity fashion stylist] June Ambrose. And they had this article, and I remember it led with \u201cstyle architect,\u201d and I was just like, \u201cThat\u2019s what I want to do!\u201d She was a major inspiration. ... I just saw her, and I was like, \u201cThis is what I aspire to be.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUltimately, it was a mentoring program led by image activist Michaela angela Davis that would be the conduit for bringing Hyacinthe\u2019s aspirations to fruition\u2014and would teach her a powerful lesson in asking for what you want:\n\nIt all starts with Michaela; she was running something called Salon du Shine at her house, where there\u2019d be a group of, like, 10 of us girls [getting] together in her loft in Brooklyn. And we would just talk about stuff, you know. And I remember going up to Michaela, like, \u201cCan you introduce me to June Ambrose?\u201d And she was just like, \u201cI don\u2019t know ... June is super-busy.\u201d I kid you not: A couple of days later, Michaela calls me and she says, \u201cJune is looking for an intern.\u201d... So I went to the interview\u2014June\u2019s two assistants at the time, they tore me to pieces\u2014but I wound up getting the internship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile interning for Ambrose, Hyacinthe also worked full time to put herself through the Fashion Merchandising Management program at New York City\u2019s Berkeley College. It was the beginning of a career path that her Haitian parents, unfortunately, didn\u2019t understand:\n\nMy parents\u2014although they were very loving\u2014they didn\u2019t understand the concept of me wanting to be a stylist and me being in a creative field; it was foreign to them. ... They didn\u2019t have the opportunity to dream as we do, and I think because of that, they\u2019re unable to\u2014they\u2019re in a sense blind to that. ... So I wound up having to put myself through college; I worked full time [in retail] and I did this internship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWorking for Ambrose taught Hyacinthe how the editorials she once obsessed over were created, but it was working in retail that helped her find her niche: helping busy professional women build their wardrobes.\n\nI would work with clients, and they\u2019d be like, \u201cSophia, I love working with you; you style me so well. I wish you could come dress me at home.\u201d And one day I actually got the courage to say, \u201cWell, I can.\u201d ... So this one client took me up on it, and I went to her house and started with her closet. But then she had me speak with her career coach, and that\u2019s when it really clicked: This is on another level. Like, you know, female executives really need this. And I really found the value that I could add.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIdentifying her core clientele and their unique need to possess a high-end wardrobe without having the time to curate or shop for it, Hyacinthe launched her company, Immaculate Wardrobe. The self-described \u201cwardrobe whisperer\u201d currently dresses about 20 clients, all of whom are powerful women who inspire her daily, as she explained:\n\n\n\nI work primarily with female boss bitches. These are women that are working [as] CEOs of companies, and they\u2019re also moms. ... I feel like it\u2019s really important for me to surround myself with these powerful women. And I feel like since they\u2019re at the top of their companies, not only am I empowering them, but also the women that come [into their companies] that\u2019ve just graduated from college ... to see that someone at the top of their career is not only killing it, but also killing it with style.\n\nBut while helping other women fulfill their potential, Hyacinthe also realized an opportunity to further fulfill her own. A longtime avid lover of music, she was often critical of DJs on the New York City nightclub scene. Challenged by an exasperated friend to learn for herself, she accepted his gift of a DJ class at New York\u2019s famed Rock & Soul record store. Instantly, another passion was born, along with an alter ego: DJ Soda Pop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike her styling career, Hyacinthe\u2019s growth as a DJ has been simultaneously organic and self-driven. She initially asked more-established DJs for opening slots and cultivated her own contacts and connections. It\u2019s a path that called into conflict the hip-hop-loving girl from New York\u2019s Bronx borough and the cultured style expert whom elite businesswomen entrust with their wardrobes:\n\n\n\nGrowing up in my family, I grew up listening to Reasonable Doubt, to Onyx, to Nas\u2014like, really hard music. Like, I\u2019m very feminine and girly now, but I grew up liking really hard-core rap. I\u2019ve always known that I\u2019ve had this love and passion for music, but it was, \u201cOK, Sophia, either you can pursue fashion styling or you can be a DJ.\u201d I didn\u2019t think in my mind\u2014I couldn\u2019t fathom the idea of me flourishing in both fields ... [But] to be honest with you, I can\u2019t exist with one without the other. ... I feel like they feed into each other so much, especially the route that I want to go. ... I want to be New York\u2019s new fashion DJ, and there\u2019s not enough of us brown girls up there that are actually doing it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile her dual careers may seem to be a study in contrasts, Hyacinthe approaches both spinning and styling instinctively, using unexpected textural combinations to evoke new feelings. And in the process of embracing her dual passions, her own identity fell into place.\n\nI feel like deejaying has really helped me fully come into my skin. ... Even with race: It\u2019s like before, I thought that I needed to kind of neglect my own identity to be accepted. And I know I\u2019m not the only one that feels that way; as a black woman in the fashion industry, which is predominantly white. I thought that I needed to strip some of my identity\u2014the fact that I listened to hip-hop, the fact that I loved it, the fact that I came from the Bronx\u2014I thought that I almost needed to move away from that in order for me to be seen in society as being this elegant person in fashion ... [but] I feel like once you accept yourself, they have no choice but to accept you for who you are. And I feel like deejaying has really allowed me to accept myself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up tip: If you\u2019re in the New York City area, you can catch DJ Soda Pop every Thursday night at the Museum of Sex at 233 Fifth Ave. She launches her weekly residency Thursday night with a viewing party for RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race.", "keywords": ["york", "think", "really", "life", "dressed", "double", "inside", "hyacinthe", "feel", "wardrobe", "women", "dj", "night", "fashion", "sophia", "career", "dope"], "polarity": 0.16347579051383396, "subjectivity": 0.5693305335968378},

I thought to myself, that's pretty cool. Well, as luck would have it, a friend of hers who reads VSB reached out and said that the professor was both an avid reader and sharer of VSB articles. Well, since I appreciate avid readers and sharers of VSB articles and since I was intrigued by the idea of the class itself, I said to myself, \"Self, mayhaps you should reach out and talk to said professor, Dr. Kinitra Brooks, about the class, if she's open to it.\" Turns out she was. Below is the email exchange interview we had about her, her class, and Beyonc\u00e9 as an academic subject. Shouts to Dr. Brooks for being awesome.\n\nPanama: First, tell me (and the people) a bit about yourself. All I know so far is that you teach at the University of Texas-San Antonio, and that you're teaching a class called \"Black Women, Beyonc\u00e9 & Popular Culture\" and Lemonade will feature prominently, I believe. Which is awesome. Like, I can't tell you how awesome I find that. But what's your background? Who exactly are you?\n\nDr. Kinitra Brooks, Ph.D.: I am a New Orleans native. I have my PhD in Comparative Literature from UNC-Chapel Hill. I specialize in African American and Afro-Caribbean women's literature and film. I am actually a horror scholar. I have a scholarly book coming out Fall (2017) titled Searching for Sycorax: Black Women Haunting Contemporary Horror and I also co-edited (with horror poet Linda Addison and fellow scholar Susana Morris) a creative anthology titled Sycorax's Daughters which features short horror fiction written by black women.\n\nI am interested in how black women remix, revise, and reimagine the horror genre both as characters and creators of horror. So, I have a scholarly article published about Michonne and Selena in The Walking Dead and 28 Days Later, respectively.\n\nI am most interested in how black women take folklore and syncretic religious practices (so spiritual practices that mix West African religion with Christianity) in their creative fiction and use it as a place of power and subversion against the horror genre and classic readings of black women's literature.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI read Gloria Naylor's Mama Day as a great example of black women writing horror which focuses on a Conjure Woman and her lineage. I read Nalo Hopkinson's fiction as this wonderful manifestation of Caribbean horror\u2014which stems from the folklore.\n\nP: You know how you ask somebody a question and the answer you get is nothing like you expected? That's exactly what just happened. For starters, I've never heard the term \"horror scholar\" and it's not because I don't get out enough. What got you so interested in the horror genre? Especially to the point where you decided to make it into a scholarly endeavor? For the record, I dodge horror films as a rule. It's not that I'm scared, it's just that the way my imagination is set up, after watching Stephen King's IT, I didn't sleep for, like, 10 years. I'm still tired.\n\nKB: LOL! I know, what I do usually sends folks left. I got into horror from my Dad (and his side of the family). My Dad was a blerd before we even knew what it was. We did an interview with him about it here at the Black Speculative Arts Digital Archive. My book opens up with a memory of the first time I saw Vamp with Grace Jones with my Aunt Errolyn and my cousin, Lee. Remember that movie? (Panama Note: I do not. Not even a little bit.) And it scared the crap out of me. But even then, I noticed that Katrina NEVER spoke! The entire film she's a central character and she never says a mumbling word! Where dey do dat at? And then, when she went into full monster mode\u2014they basically exaggerated all of her African features (nose, mouth, etc.,). Even as a little girl I was like\u2026something is off.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI watched Night of the Living Dead with my Dad early on. And then I got into Stephen King in 6th grade. It scarred me for life. I still sleep with the light on when my husband is out of town. And then me and my Dad were really into Buffy and Angel (we are now obsessed with Supernatural) and I was HIGHLY pissed when they killed the black slayer, Kendra. (I'm STILL pissed)\n\nBut our ideas of fear and what scares us is heavily influenced by culture and society. The majority of horror traffics in some form of Negrophobia or Gynophobia. And since I studied black women, I've always been fascinated by what happens if you fit both of those qualities? Both black AND woman? And I've been down that rabbit hole ever since.\n\nPlus black women have BEEN writing horror and trafficking in supernatural themes, it was simply called something else. Folklore (Zora Neale Hurston) or magical realism (Toni Morrison). But so much of the scholarship has focused on the horrors of enslavement but not actual horror itself. And granted, sometimes there are valid intersections of those areas, but other times, not so much.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nP: I have now spoken more about horror anything in these few questions than I have in the entire 37 years of my existence. You have changed my life. Thank you. So now that I know a bit about you, let's talk about this class and how you ended up getting this approved. For starters, are you a huge Beyonc\u00e9 fan? I am. I'm guessing you'd need to be in order to teach an entire class about her. I ain't saying you have to be part of the Beyhive, but I guess it might help. But what spurred this idea and turned it into an actual class? And why?\n\nKB: How did I get it approved? I've taught kooky classes before. I'm the weird one in the department. So, I've taught Horror Text & Theory, Black Women in Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror, Speculative Black Women, Bad Black Mothers\u2014so a class about Beyonc\u00e9 was almost normal at this point. My department is pretty supportive about my course choices.\n\nI have become a Beyonc\u00e9 fan with her last two projects. Before then, I was pretty fairweather in my fandom. I enjoyed and appreciated her music and definitely her Black woman Southerness but I wouldn't have called myself a true fan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was really in defending Beyonc\u00e9's choices to other folks that I literally had an \"Omigosh. I'm in the Beyhive!\" moment. She got such flack for her last album (self-titled Beyonc\u00e9) and daring to be sexual with her husband. I was just like, look the woman has followed all of the rules that society makes for black women\u2014she's conventionally attractive with enough curves to be appealing, she comes from a two-parent home, she got married to a successful Black man who was just street enough, and then she had her child\u2014and now she can't sing about banging her husband? Whatever.\n\nI tell my students and my friends, black women are going to be denigrated no matter what you choose. You might as well be yourself and be happy.\n\nBut the Lemonade project was completely different. It was that moment where she recites the \u201cAnger\u201d section. Where she discusses literally wearing the other woman's skin and using her spine as a bedazzled cane\u2026I literally jumped off my seat. That's the Boo Hag! That's the Soucouyant! These are folkloric characters who are know for shedding own skin (soucouyant) or wearing the skin of another (Boo Hag). That fell right into my research! And they say black women don't do horror?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was also co-teaching a Black Lives Matter class when \u201cFormation\u201d dropped. Me and other black feminist scholars were literally analyzing the video in the comment sections and DMs of Facebook. The next class, I began to show my students our work so they could see theoretical frameworks being constructed by academics as it happened and they were SO into it!\n\nA few weeks later, Candice Benbow released the Lemonade Syllabus with lots of material with which I was quite familiar. At that point, I knew I could make this into a class.\n\nP: I think it's awesome that your school is supportive of your course choices. I've often wondered if Black professors were stymied in taking chances or if many just weren't actually taking chances. Granted, I'm about 13 years out of any type of educational institution so it's entirely possible that there are courses on all fashion of the Black experience, but we always seem to hear about them for a reason. So the Beyonc\u00e9 fan in me is excited that any classes of the sort exist. And I do think she took her artistry into a whole different stratosphere with the release of Lemonade.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeems like the visuals alone are ripe for the picking for all matters of the experience of Black women, in particular. It's for reasons like that I wish that I could audit a class just to see what Beyonc\u00e9 in an academic setting looks like. So, what DOES Beyonc\u00e9 in an academic setting look like? What's the approach? Projects? Tell me about the class!\n\nKB: Some do and get stymied. Some don't and won\u2019t take that chance. I believe my freedom in course choices to be not necessarily unique but also not necessarily common. Some folks get handed a syllabus when they arrive with the understanding that this is the way the department has taught African American literature for the last 15 years and expects to teach it for the next 15 years. I also earn/balance out my course freedom by teaching core or service course like the Intro courses that are the workhorses of the department. So, I'm also teaching Introduction to Graduate Studies along with the Beyonc\u00e9 course.\n\nHmm. Beyonc\u00e9 in an academic setting. I've included the syllabus (Beyonce Syllabus) so you can see what's going on but it's about using Lemonade as a framework with which to enter a conversation that's been going on about black womanhood amongst black women for over a century. Janell Hobson has spoken about Beyonc\u00e9 as a Conjure Woman and so I have the students read her blog post and then use that idea to introduce the folkloric figure of The Conjure Woman\u2014who first appeared in African American literature in the late 19th-Century in a collection of stories by Charles Chesnutt. So we read about the oral folklore concerning the Conjure Woman in the work of Kameelah Martin and then look at the contemporary literary manifestation of the Conjure Woman by reading Gloria Naylor's Mama Day. So the students start with Beyonc\u00e9 and expand further into classic African American literature and folklore.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThough today, I finally admitted to the students what they all knew. They had been bamboozled! Led astray (Their words!) because I have them reading hardcore literary theory and analyzing complex literature and folklore all under the guise of studying Beyonc\u00e9.\n\nBut the class wouldn't be so successful if I didn't have such a strong group of students. They are working their butts off and thinking about blackness and womanhood in popular culture and literature they never thought they could accomplish. And I am so proud of them. They continue to amaze me because they are so passionate and yet complex in their assessments of the readings.\n\nAnd today I assigned them to make their own Lemonade Short films they write, film, edit, and analyze themselves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nP: I imagine that the possibility of taking a class about Beyonc\u00e9, and specifically Lemonade would be very well received by students, even if they do feel bamboozled. What kind of students sign up for the class? Do you think they'll come out with a greater appreciation for Beyonc\u00e9 and look at Lemonade differently? Has teaching this class made you look at Beyonc\u00e9 differently?\n\nKB: Teaching this class has definitely made me see her differently. I think I respect her more because of how deeply so many of the students admire her. And how hard they are willing to work to understand more of what she is doing.\n\nWe have all kinds of students. Half of the class is Black women. The other half is a healthy mix of Latina and white students, male and female, and across the sexuality spectrum. I am surprised by the number of straight male students of color (Black and Latino) that are in the class who are doing the work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI also want to be clear. None of the students are drinking Beyonc\u00e9 Kool-Aid. They have some hard questions for her and the work and make me think harder about the work. They push back in terms of who isn't included in Lemonade that often go hard for Beyonc\u00e9\u2014fat women and men who identify as queer (particularly those of color).\n\nI can't wait until we read the pieces that push back at Lemonade and they take their analysis even deeper. We are going to read Ashleigh Shackleford's piece on Lemonade and feeling excluded and I think it is strong and going to really push the students to interrogate Beyonc\u00e9 and the text for weaknesses and examine her imperfections, which is necessary as critics of Beyonc\u00e9 and popular culture as a whole. But I continue to reiterate, similar to their support of Lemonade\u2014their critiques of Lemonade must be as supported and documented by the evidence.\n\nP: Well I think this is all awesome and I really appreciate you taking the time to share and discuss the class with me. As a student of pop culture, I'm always intrigued when academics find ways to intermingle the two worlds. Has the class and response from students met your own expectations? And are there any other types of classes you hope to bring to the masses that are in similar veins? I understand if you can't let that cat out of the bag, but I had to ask. And lastly, is there anything additional that you'd like to share about the class, life, or anything? The floor is yours!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKB: Wow, the entire floor? That makes me nervous.\n\nMy students have exceeded my expectations. The response for the class has been out of control. I simply wanted to work out my thoughts on Lemonade with my students as I am co-writing an article with Dr. Kameelah Martin! A great trick we academics use is to center your class readings/teachings on your current research so you are FORCED to do the reading and writing\u2014because you have to teach it.\n\nI'm currently working on a course on Afrofuturism and planning a visit from Black Kirby next semester to talk about Blackness, comic books, and cool science fiction stuff.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnything I can do to get my students excited about literature and cultural studies concerning black womanhood in all its many different aspects, I'm in. Lemonade is not perfect, nothing is, but it gave many of us scholars an opportunity, an entrance into the enthusiasm of our students. Many of my colleagues had students emailing us and asking all kinds of interesting questions and courses like this are our opportunity to weave together what our students see every day and the socio-cultural structures that gird them. We also get a chance to share what we do and remove some of the mystery that surrounds academia for folks.\n\nThank you for this opportunity. I really enjoyed our conversation and thanks for showing some love to academia. I really enjoy your website and have been following y'all for years. (And sometimes fighting in the comment sections\u2014under my secret agent alias, of course!)\n\nHave a wonderful day!\n\nP: Thank you!", "keywords": ["class", "im", "lemonade", "literature", "dr", "beyonc\u00e9", "brooks", "horror", "kinitra", "black", "women", "interview", "teaches", "students", "woman"], "polarity": 0.10883355287364249, "subjectivity": 0.4692899110628196},

Maxine Waters: Breaker of Chains, Reclaimer of Time\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter having to suffer the devastating dishonor of having an orange buffoon in the White House, black people have pretty much been fed up since before 2017. And no person illustrated this \u201cfed-uppedness\u201d more than longtime career politician Rep. Maxine Waters.\n\n\n\nMadame Waters (D-Calif.) was, quite frankly, the mood of 2017. From her hilarious and biting tweets to her determination to see Donald Trump impeached, she simply had no fucks to give. And the greatest example of this was when her legitimate question about 45\u2019s financial ties to Russia was interrupted by wayward Caucasian American Steven Mnuchin. The deflection did not deter her and she instead repeated \u201cReclaiming my time\u201d over and over again until he eventually shut the fuck up.\n\nShe\u2019s a boss. You know it. I know it. And 2017 knew it.\n\n2. Michelle Obama and the Side Eye Seen\u2019t Around the World\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMuch despair was felt through the force when it was announced that Agent Orange was gonna waltz his baked-Cheeto, dusty ass into the White House. And while that was bad enough, most of us couldn\u2019t stop thinking about how little time we had left to spend with the Obamas. So imagine our surprise when Michelle Obama gifted us with enough side eye during Inauguration Day to help us power through the rest of 2017.\n\nYes, before she would walk into the sunset with her beloved Barack and say goodbye to us forever, our good sis Michelle gave the best side eye ever after getting a gift from Melania and listening to all the Inauguration Day malarkey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was her final act as first lady. And what an act it was.\n\n3. Anika Noni Rose Lovingly Encouraging Cicely Tyson at the Emmys\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have a love-hate relationship with the Emmys, mostly based on how Caucasian the nomination lineups are for the night. However, I luckily caught a few moments from the 2017 Emmys. And I\u2019m glad I did because had I not, I would have missed one of the greatest moments in Black Girl Magic history.\n\n\n\nThe moment includes both Anika Noni Rose and Cicely Tyson going up to announce the winner for Outstanding Limited Series. The immortal Tyson paused right before recalling her role in Roots, and instead of awkwardly standing there until Tyson remembered, Rose leaned over and whispered an encouragement in Tyson\u2019s ears.\n\n\n\nIt was one of the simplest yet greatest acts of black sisterhood and solidarity that I had seen in a while. And in a year that was as brutal as 2017, it was sorely needed.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. World Stop: Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Pregnancy Announcement\n\nGreatness begets greatness. I don\u2019t know who said that, and I don\u2019t care to ask, but just know that it has been and always will be applied to Her Majesty King Beyonc\u00e9, First and Only of Her Name.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter having a fantastic year in 2016, Beyonc\u00e9 blew our black minds when she surprise-announced her pregnancy on Instagram with the radiance and grace of a black Madonna. And while gracing us with her otherworldliness, she managed to piss off white women and white conservatives and inspire low-budget Great Value copycats in one wild swoop.\n\nNever change, Bey. Never change.\n\n5. Black Twitter Gathering Kendall Jenner\u2019s Edges Over That Pepsi Commercial\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlenty of black folx had a fantastic year. Cardi B had a fantastic year. Issa Rae had a phenomenal year. Rihanna had a spectacular year. New Edition had an amazing year. And Tiffany Haddish had an astounding year.\n\n\n\nThe list of black people laughing in the face of 2017 is very long. But such a list would be incomplete without the collective that is Black Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack Twitter has been a respected entity for a while now. But it truly cemented itself as a cultural force for change when it single-handedly got Kendall Jenner\u2019s tone-deaf-ass Pepsi commercial yoinked from the TV airwaves. Indeed, Jenner thought she was doing all of us a favor by throwing some dusty Party City wig at a fellow sista in the commercial (an apt self-dragging of white feminism) before hijacking black and brown traditions of protest, and Black Twitter, of course, said, \u201cNot today, Satan.\u201d\n\n\n\nCombine this with other cultural moments like spurring on (along with Black Tumblr) Netflix to make that Rihanna-Lupita Nyong\u2019o Heist movie, penned by Issa Rae and directed by Ava DuVernay, a reality and exposing the hell out of Keaton Jones\u2019 white supremacist family, and it is very clear that Black Twitter is here to stay and suffers no fools.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. Black Women in Alabama Telling Roy Moore, \u201cYou Thought!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou probably notice how I keep mentioning that 2017 was a tough-ass year. This is most certainly true, especially politically.\n\nSince the Over-Inflated Tangerine was voted into office by white women, it\u2019s been a yearlong battle to make sure that our legislators, quite frankly, do not kill us. This has been true concerning the Affordable Care Act, the GOP tax plan, net neutrality and so much more. So you can say, politically, we really needed a win.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd black women gave us exactly that in the election battle between Roy Moore and Doug Jones for a U.S. Senate seat representing Alabama.\n\nThe choice was between an accused child-molesting, homophobic bigot and a Democrat, Doug Jones, and white people almost purposely screwed the pooch again by voting in the alleged child molester because he was \u201ccloser to God\u201d (cue an eye roll). Of course, black women did not allow this to pass.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was a nod to the 94 percent who showed us they had common sense during the general election, and it proved that, yes, even states like Alabama (where black people live, too, Bernie Sanders) can have competitive elections if given the fucking chance.\n\nBlack women, I salute you. Truly.\n\n7. It Ain\u2019t Over Till It\u2019s Over: Moonlight\n\nIn that same vein, 2017 must have been the year of \u201cHold up, wait a minute,\u201d because not only did black people pull off the upset in Alabama this year, but we managed to pull it off during Oscar season, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarlier this year, La La Land was heavily projected to win the Oscar for Best Picture over Moonlight, and despite all the queer black people everywhere giving Goku our energy for a spirit bomb, it looked like La La Land would indeed win. And that much was confirmed when B(La)h B(La)h Land was crowned winner.\n\nThat is ... until it was un-crowned.\n\nIn one of the most confusing moments of 2017, La La Land producer Jordan Horowitz snatched the card from the dazed and confused presenter and clarified that it was Moonlight that had actually won Best Picture. I\u2019m always gonna wonder who I need to drag for low-key stealing Moonlight\u2019s moment, but this should be a lesson to us as a people that it is not over until we say it\u2019s over.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. Colin Kaepernick Has the Last Laugh\n\nColin Kaepernick\u2019s long, hard-fought battle to call out police brutality and systemic injustice started out in 2016 when he, a San Francisco 49ers quarterback at the time, sat down during the playing of the national anthem at a preseason game versus the Green Bay Packers.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince then, the football player and activist has been the center of an intense, national debate on racial and social injustice, and because he continued to walk and talk the talk, the powers that be decided that Kaepernick would enter the year as an unsigned free agent, despite being more talented than plenty of other current quarterbacks (*stares at Jay Cutler*).\n\n\n\nAnd these racist NFL owners probably had a good chuckle over it all ... until it was announced that Kaepernick was suing the shit out of all of them, of course.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot only did Kaepernick decide to bring a case against them, but he also went on to become GQ\u2019s Citizen of the Year, and he\u2019s currently mulling over the prospect of maybe owning the Carolina Panthers alongside Diddy and Steph Curry.\n\nClearly, Kaepernick is just getting started.\n\n9. Black People Do Do Horror: On Get Out Being a Success\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn times of trial and tribulation, black art has risen like a phoenix and thrived in the face of uncertainty, and Get Out was certainly not an exception this year.\n\n\n\nJordan Peele\u2019s directorial debut and smash hit changed the game forever this year.\n\nNot only did it make bank with a film budget that sounded like the movie-producing equivalent of $3, but its biting social commentary on racial relations in America presented in the horror genre reminded us of how multifaceted black people are and how it\u2019s about damn time that black creatives get to flex our muscles in genre movies (another great example of this is Dee Rees\u2019 Mudbound, which no doubt counts as a Western/period piece).\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd not even the Golden Globes\u2019 outdated genre system can take this win away from us.\n\n10. LeBron James Calling Donald Trump by His Name: \u201cBum\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the year when white people continued to show their asses and black people made a conscious and collective decision to stop giving a singular fuck, no such person illustrated this big mood quite like LeBron R. James.\n\nJames, a three-time NBA champ, has proved time and time again that he doesn\u2019t concern himself with the opinions of sheep, but he took this attitude to the next level when the Expired Squash got in his Twitter feelings about Steph Curry and the Golden State Warriors\u2019 declining his booty-ass invite to visit the White (Supremacist) House.\n\nTrump was about five more seconds from going full Mean Girls on Curry (which included uninviting them) when James became sick of the bullshit and fired off the tweet heard around the world:\n\nHe called 45 a \u201cbum.\u201d\n\nThe legendary tweet is still on James\u2019 Twitter page. To this day. And I am hoping that it continues to serve as a visible reminder that black people from all walks of life are never too busy to speak truth to power and call a spade a spade. All while having a good and necessary laugh.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd that\u2019s that on that.", "keywords": ["twitter", "kaepernick", "won", "white", "moments", "tyson", "women", "black", "land", "2017", "la"], "polarity": 0.10843534659042689, "subjectivity": 0.4960628438703303},

Sleight\n\nIf a white filmmaker had made this small, contemplative superhero origin story, it would have been enough to convince studio executives to give him a chance to make a big-budget genre film. Instead, many have still heard of neither the film nor J.D. Dillard, the black writer and director. Sleight takes seriously the question of what would happen if a superhero were to come out of a South Central, Calif., milieu. This is one of the most original superhero films of 2017.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Strong Island\n\nThis is a beautiful, devastating film about the 1992 murder of the filmmaker\u2019s brother that occurred on New York\u2019s Long Island and how, because the victim was black and the perpetrator white, justice remains elusive. Yet while Yance Ford explores the crime, he is more interested in what grief did to his family because they were forced to move forward without resolution. This is required viewing.\n\n\n\n3. Mudbound\n\nDirected by Dee Rees of Pariah fame and co-written by her and Virgil Williams, this Netflix original film examines how racism and war forever change two families\u2014one white, the other black\u2014struggling to survive in early-20th-century America. Mary J. Blige gives a powerful performance as the matriarch of the Jackson family. I expect her to receive an Oscar nomination for her role.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Girls Trip\n\nThe comedy of the year follows a group of black women as they reconnect in New Orleans during the Essence Festival. If you haven\u2019t seen this, shame on you\u2014but be warned: You\u2019ll never look at grapefruit the same again.\n\n\n\n1. Get Out\n\nThis is the movie of 2017. While it has been analyzed and discussed ad nauseam, the fact that Jordan Peele called this a documentary, not a fictional tale, is one of the most insightful comments he could have made about the film.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNext, the best television:\n\n5. Black-ish\n\nIn the same way that we take LeBron James for granted, we also take for granted this show\u2019s consistent greatness. It tells the hard truths about being black in America without losing sight of the joy that being black can bring. The fact that it does this on network TV and has not yet been canceled is a testament to the writing and acting on the show.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Underground\n\nAlthough it was canceled, this was one of the most original shows of the year. There were many narrative questions left unanswered, but that does not take away from the fact that this season was brilliant.\n\n\n\n3. Greenleaf\n\nThis season of Greenleaf was an honest examination of homophobia, class, family and pettiness within the black church. It doesn\u2019t hide the revered institution\u2019s imperfections; nor is it cynical about the good that can be found between those four walls. This and Queen Sugar are proof that Oprah has become the 21st century\u2019s patron saint of black visual art.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Queen Sugar\n\nIt was hard to put this at No. 2 because of the beauty and honesty of the show, which, in no small part, is because black women are deeply involved in the writing, direction and running of the show. Yet while the direction and writing of this show are top-notch, the performances of the actors in the series that is in the No. 1 spot, plus the sheer ubiquitous nature of that show\u2019s cultural conversation, are what place it just above this one.\n\n\n\n1. Insecure\n\nPart of why Issa Rae\u2019s HBO original series became a social media phenomenon is that each character in the show is so well-written, you can see why they make the poor decisions they do while still being angry with them for making those choices. The only thing I would change is the male lead\u2019s name. He is out here messing it up for everyone named Lawrence.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI mean, I am Team Lawrence, but I ain\u2019t team that dude.", "keywords": ["family", "original", "shes", "didnt", "tv", "white", "writing", "gotta", "film", "superhero", "series", "black", "shows", "cut", "movies", "2017"], "polarity": 0.11444075587334017, "subjectivity": 0.450336227442969},

(No.) Which then made me ask if at that point \u2014 an hour into the night \u2014 there'd been any White performers. (Just Ariana Grande. Who earned honorary Black sympathy points by dating Big Sean, so she doesn't even really count. Thank you for your service, Ariana. May your wings forever be well-cooked and properly seasoned.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich then led me to conclude that I was watching the Blackest VMAs ever. Not the best \u2014 as the only actual memorable performances on stage were Beyonce's set and Rihanna's cheekbone jumping between her lips and Drake's lips and taking the bullet. But as someone who's watched enough VMAs to consider himself a VMA watching veteran (which is the most depressing thing I consider myself to be), I can't recall a Blacker time. The hosts were Black, the co-hosts were Black, the presenters were (mostly) Black, the performers were (mostly) Black, the winners were (mostly) Black, and even Kanye was (mostly) Black last night.\n\nAnyway, these are some of my thoughts on the night MTV stole BET's steez.\n\n1. If you're not a fan of Key & Peele, I imagine last night was a 180-minute-long confirmation of why you find their absurd and at times too esoteric humor to be grating. If you are a fan of Key & Peele (as I am) I imagine last night was the equivalent of convincing your friends to accompany you to a restaurant they're not particularly fond of.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Trust me!\" you say. \"The food is gonna be great this time!\" So they come with you, already skeptical, and eat the food\u2026and hate it. \"Well\" you say in response to their collective irritable bowels \"it's an acquired taste.\"\n\nThat said, even as a fan, I have to admit they had more misses than hits last night.\n\n2. I've come to believe that the only reason I have a baby is that when she's mature and advanced enough to communicate complex thoughts, she finds a way to help me understand why Future is a thing. And I'm saying this as someone who actually doesn't actively dislike his music. I think it's generally okay, and I really liked \"Same Damn Time\" for nearly three weeks in 2012. I just feel the same way about him that I feel about cucumbers. They're fine in salads and on vegetable trays and shit. But if cucumber cafes suddenly became a thing \u2014 popping up in spades in every gentrified neighborhood \u2014 I would go into the nearest cucumber cafe, stand on a table and scream \"WHY ARE YOU PEOPLE HERE?!? CUCUMBERS ARE NOT IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO BE A THING!!! THEY DON'T EVEN TASTE LIKE ANYTHING!!! CAN SOMEONE PLEASE EXPLAN THE CUCUMBER THING TO ME BECAUSE I JUST DON'T GET IT AND IT'S DRIVING ME CRAZY!!!\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. That said, as an admirer of performative petty, I appreciate the cameraman who zoomed in on Desiigner while Future was performing. That was top-notch, Grade-A petty. If Future is a cucumber, Desiigner is a water chestnut.\n\n4. Jay Pharoah's Kevin Hart is his Mona Lisa, his masterpiece. It's so good that he should attempt to convince Hollywood to save a few million with the next Kevin Hart movie and just start casting him doing a Kevin Hart impression instead of Kevin Hart.\n\n5. Alicia Keys seems to be firmly ensconced in and committed to this \"bless her heart\" phase of her career, and it's sweet. Her heart is blessed. She is nestled in try-hard; burrowed in earnestness; snuggled up in a blanket of African Arts Festival tent residue. And, last night, she invented a new genre: spoken word classic rock. Good for her!\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. Listening to Kanye West speak on stage in 2016 is like waiting in a two-hour-long line for a broken roller coaster. The anticipation of what he might say far surpasses the interestingness of what he actually says. Which, for him, is unfortunate. Because his music is still very good. As is (some of) the things he has to say when it's not \"Kanye is saying things now\" time. But the residue of the fatigue of his increasingly transparent attempts at provocation \u2014 which is now actually, kinda just boring \u2014 has a way of permeating how the music is processed and assessed.\n\n7. I'm glad White America knows who Teyana Taylor is now. Welcome to the party. And I just hope her insane performance and her literally unbelievable body \u2014 it was like watching a live-action Elastagirl \u2014 doesn't distract them from the fact that Iman Shumpert and the Cleveland Cavaliers fought back from a 3-to-1 series deficit to defeat the Golden State Warriors in the NBA Finals.\n\n8. Beyonce\u2026Beyonce just Beyonced. There's nothing else to say. Beyonce just Beyonced the fuck out of that stage. And Beyonced the fuck out of the backstage by having the mothers of Eric Garner, Trayvon Martin, Mike Brown, and Oscar Grant as her guests.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(Of course, the obvious question here is \"What about Sandra Bland's people?\" But, well, um, let's just move on.)\n\n\n\n9. So, we've already established that scheduling Britney Spears's much-hyped comeback performance right after Beyonce was cruel and unusual punishment. This was ultimately the VMA's equivalent of waterboarding. Even Britney herself seemed shellshocked at MTV positioning her to be the Sam's Club Splenda to Beyonce's Lemonade.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut what's the alternative? You can't really open or close the show with her now in 2016, so she was always going to be stuck in the middle somewhere. So why not schedule her directly after Beyonce \u2014 a time you know most people will be watching? I guess that question doesn't have a very satisfying answer either. Maybe next year, when, I don't know, Pink or someone wants to make a big comeback splash, they should just send her to voicemail. And then pick up at the last moment like \"Oh, I didn't know you were calling. Did you want to be on the show?\" And then Pink says \"Yes!\" And they're like \"We only have one slot left. After Beyonce. Are you cool with that?\" And then Pink, already deep in \"left like 16 voicemails already\" fatigue, just says yes and accepts it.\n\n10. Of course, the entire night was ultimately a prolonged culmination to Rihanna's acceptance of the Video Vanguard Award. Which ultimately served as a contrived meet-cute to get Drake and Rihanna on stage together. Let's talk about that!\n\nRemember on The Wire, right before Michael killed Snoop, when she said (paraphrasing) \"You never could have been one of us\" \u2014 her way of saying that Michael just had too much of a conscience to be like Snoop, Chris, and Marlo? Well, I feel the same way about Drake and \"being a fuckboy.\" He makes fuckboy anthems \u2014 shit, he makes entire fuckboy albums \u2014 tries to do fuckboy things, dates fuckboy magnets, and even apparently became BFFs with Future, who's basically Fuckboy Emeritus. But I just don't think he has it in him to be that type of guy. He just seems to like women too much to be one. And not \"likes women\" in a \"likes having sex with women\" sense. (Although I assume he enjoys that too.) But actually likes their company, companionship, and friendship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, this is not a bad thing at all. It's actually, for lack of a better term, refreshing. And, with his H&M tux draped on his Dominican Uncle torso last night, his very obvious affection for Rihanna was palpable and endearing. Which is why her curve last night \u2014 and yes, she totally gave him the \"we're better as friends\" cheek turn when he attempted to kiss her \u2014 was so cringe-worthy to watch. It was like throwing someone an alley oop\u2026and then watching them just watch the ball drift out of bounds while they made no effort to get it.\n\nGIF\n\nLet's watch again, from a different angle!\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, to be fair, Rihanna's reaction could have been less \"awww, bless your little Canadian heart \" and more her being pissed that Drake was making her moment about himself. During his speech, I'm sure she was thinking what many of us were thinking while watching it: \"This nigga better not propose.\"", "keywords": ["worst", "say", "actually", "thing", "best", "fuckboy", "stage", "night", "ive", "black", "watching", "blackest", "way", "moments", "vmas", "seen"], "polarity": 0.059464247336587756, "subjectivity": 0.4823512736278695},

It stuck with me as I watched the New York Times\u2019 election needle tremble back and forth during Alabama\u2019s special election, in which an alleged pedophile, Roy Moore, was nearly sent to the U.S. Senate. It dug in when I saw a statistic that echoed to a similar one regarding Donald Trump voters from November of last year: Sixty-three percent of white women voted for Moore. And when pundits began their near-instant erasure of that fact, Williams\u2019 anecdote, relayed with wide-eyed disbelief by the actress, rose up like detritus stirred up by a current.\n\nThe truly radical thing about Get Out, the horror it captures with precision and clarity, is less about the violence white people can and have exacted on black bodies. What\u2019s truly terrifying about the film, about Rose\u2019s character, is the assumption of white innocence\u2014an innocence that is reflected in white audiences\u2019 insistent belief that Rose is, deep down, good. Chris, the film\u2019s main character, is just as guilty of this as the white audience that approaches Williams. It\u2019s as if the delusion of innocence is itself a kind of hypnosis, even as the evidence of villainy is literally written on the wall (\u201cShe has photos of people whose lives she ended behind her\u201d).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2017, I learned that the fulcrum of white supremacy isn\u2019t violence, as I had always thought. It was virtue.\n\nI understand that, to many, this isn\u2019t a particularly new or bold revelation, but I had gotten used to thinking of white supremacy in terms of violence: of physical violence, but also emotional trauma, the plunder of one\u2019s body as well as one\u2019s mind and one\u2019s wealth. It wasn\u2019t until talking to Joe Feagin, a professor at Texas A&M University who is credited with coining the term \u201csystemic racism,\u201d that I was introduced to the concept of white virtue\u2014and how it was the axis on which white supremacy turns.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn his theory of the \u201cwhite racial frame\u201d\u2014a pro-white worldview that many white and nonwhite people aren\u2019t consciously aware they\u2019ve absorbed\u2014whiteness is seen as inherently good.\n\n\u201cWe whites are trained into seeing ourselves as virtuous. We have the most virtuous history. We have the most advanced civilization,\u201d Feagin explained. \u201cWe speak the best-quality English. We have the best beauty images, especially for women. All of those things ... civilization, history, values, religion, virtues, work ethic.\u201d\n\nAnd, Feagin adds, it\u2019s the hardest element of socialized racism for white people to dismantle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was hard for me, a biracial Filipina, to wrap my head around this at first. Aren\u2019t all people, all tribes, convinced of their goodness? Doesn\u2019t that need for self-preservation, to guard the image of yourself as virtuous, sit deep within everyone?\n\nWe can\u2019t count the number of black and brown lives this country has plundered and broken in the name of white virtue: to preserve white neighborhoods and white voting booths, to keep women and bloodlines \u201cpure\u201d and politics \u201cclean.\u201d\n\nBut the difference is one of scale and cost: This nation codified the value of whiteness into its earliest laws: laying out who exactly was and wasn\u2019t white. Detailing and revising exactly what that whiteness earned you. Whiteness (along with maleness, along with money) was a virtue. And from those who did not meet its qualifications, this country extracted a steep price.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe evidence of this inclination to insist on white virtue is everywhere. There\u2019s the obvious: the white supremacists and white nationalists who refuse to cede any political or cultural ground to people of color; the neo-Nazis and the Holocaust deniers. Fringe groups who assumed center stage in American discourse in 2017.\n\nBut it\u2019s evident in smaller offenses. Rhetorically, it\u2019s in the way Ryan Lochte, a 33-year-old Olympic swimmer, can be called a \u201cboy\u201d when he engages in criminal behavior. It\u2019s evident in the way white people\u2019s racist performances\u2014the nigger jokes, the blackface\u2014can be excused as \u201cjust jokes.\u201d It\u2019s the ease with which white people (and lots of nonblack people) can slip into caricatures of African Americans that paint them as lazy, incompetent or immoral. It\u2019s evident in the quick and ready defenses some white people provide when faced with uncomfortable conversations about systemic racism: Yeah, but I had nothing to do with that. That was a long time ago. It\u2019s not like I owned slaves. I wasn\u2019t there.\n\n\n\nThis, despite the fact that we can\u2019t count the number of black and brown lives this country has plundered and broken in the name of white virtue: to preserve white neighborhoods and white voting booths, to keep women and bloodlines \u201cpure\u201d and politics \u201cclean.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA comfortable delusion. A self-serving hypnosis. An insistence on innocence that delays a reckoning.\n\nI\u2019m not shocked that there are white audiences who see Rose and still insist on seeing a victim, on drawing some strand of virtue from a character who is clearly aware of what she is doing and delights in it. If we consider white virtue to be the fulcrum of white supremacy, nobody symbolizes this virtue more than white women.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn this way, you see Rose everywhere.\n\nYou see it when Betsy DeVos is looked at as an incompetent stooge rather than an active, knowledgeable participant in dismantling our public education system. You see it in the false feminism and performative innocence of Ivanka Trump, a woman credited with helping push the GOP\u2019s tax bill\u2014an enormous wealth transfer for the rich\u2014through Congress. You see it in the silence of white Hollywood when their black peers are attacked or exploited (this pattern, of course, extends to other industries). In 2017, Rose was just as likely to wear a pussy hat as a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d shirt.\n\nThe cruelty that extends the cut? Even as we\u2019re surrounded by the evidence of Rose\u2019s crimes (look no further than the White House), many are reluctant to reckon with the woman in the mirror. To part with their innocence. To break the hypnosis that continues to bind and betray us all.", "keywords": ["supremacy", "shes", "violence", "armitage", "rose", "white", "virtue", "women", "black", "innocence", "2017"], "polarity": 0.06526736813871553, "subjectivity": 0.3853764921946739},

The group were asked to pay before they were allowed to be seated. Savage and her friends agreed to pay, but then noticed something was not quite right after she realized that other customers weren\u2019t asked to do the same.\n\nSavage asked the manager about the discrepancy, only for the manager to respond, \u201cYou people steal.\u201d\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe the way we were treated there,\u201d she told the newspaper.\n\nAnother diner who noticed the disagreement reportedly got involved and began shouting at the manager about the discriminatory behavior. But the manager, Jay Dong, apparently has no shame in his stance, and insists that his policies are not racist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDong told the site that he makes some people pay up front, acknowledging that more often than not those customers are black, but notes that he does not think it\u2019s discrimination because he does not make all of his black customers pay first. So naturally that makes it all better.\n\nHe said that it was a policy he usually uses for people he does not know, or when it\u2019s a big group of people who plan to pay for separate checks.\n\n\u201cA lot of people steal from me.

As The State notes, it all started when Black Lives Matter staged a counterprotest to a white secessionist Statehouse rally about the Confederate flag.

Many of us are just now learning their names: Katherine Johnson, Mary Jackson and Dorothy Vaughn.\n\nSo much of our history has been omitted from the curricula of many schools. That's a huge chunk of the foundation of racism that our country is built on. It's the reason that the three women who are highlighted in Hidden Figures, as well as the many black women who worked right alongside them and many others, have been ignored by history. It's the reason that today, some 54 years later, we still have to proclaim that black lives matter when we see evidence right in front of our eyes that says they don't.\n\nAstronaut John Glenn's orbit around Earth in 1962 was called one of the most important flights in U.S. history, and it no doubt is. NASA even says that because of that mission, Glenn \"became a national hero and a symbol of American ambition.\" And yet there was no mention of the numbers that made the mission successful, or that the only numbers Glenn trusted were Johnson's.\n\nAt a press conference for Hidden Figures, Taraji P. Henson, who plays Johnson, said, \u201cWhen you\u2019re playing a person who\u2019s real, there\u2019s a responsibility to get it right. As soon as I signed on, I asked if she was still alive. I had to meet her immediately.\u201d Johnson and her family were delighted not only to meet the superstar but also to have her play the beloved matriarch, who is now 98 years old.\n\nAnd while Henson felt that she was in the presence of a queen-and-superhero hybrid, it was Johnson's humility that floored her. Johnson told Henson that it's just the way things were and she just wanted to do her job and do it well. Henson was blown away, as we will be with her performance. Taraji P. Henson becomes Katherine Johnson\u2014embodying struggle and flight.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOctavia Spencer, who portrays Vaughn, was the first to sign on to the hefty project, and she just knew she needed to be a part of it. So of course the director, Theodore \u201cTed\u201d Melfi, locked the Oscar-winning actress in. At the Hidden Figures press conference, of her portrayal of Vaughn, she said, \"There\u2019s enough negative images of black women out there. I didn\u2019t want to portray her in some stereotype. I wanted to make sure her integrity was preserved.\u201d\n\nThese heroes' images are not only preserved but reinvigorated. These women will help future generations defy the world's limitations. Margot Shetterly, the author of the book Hidden Figures, which was being produced the same time as the movie, says that her mission was to expand the idea of what black women were capable of. \"They went to work and brought their A game. They did our country and women a great service. They are the American dream,\" Shetterly says.\n\nThis is a history lesson we all deserve. Knowing that black women were the backbone of one of the biggest space missions in America is knowing that we can be anything. It's knowing that #BlackGirlMagic is an actual trait in our DNA that allows us to excel gracefully. It's knowing that even when we're \"hidden figures,\" we're still there, making our mark.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCheck out the trailer:", "keywords": ["hidden", "henson", "johnson", "right", "upholds", "mission", "figures", "knowing", "legacy", "changed", "history", "women", "extraordinary", "black", "world"], "polarity": 0.14494047619047615, "subjectivity": 0.49054232804232795},

Aside from being a groundbreaking hit, the visual album inevitably rekindled a flurry of questions about her marriage to Jay-Z, sparked by the infamous \u201cbillion dollars on an elevator incident\u201d nearly two years before.\n\n\n\nDid he? Didn\u2019t he? Was it just a publicity stunt? Despite earlier rumors and artistic allusions to Jay-Z\u2019s complicated relationship with monogamy (\u201cSong Cry,\u201d \u201cBig Pimpin\u2019\u201d and \u201cGirls, Girls, Girls,\u201d to name a few), the questions were suddenly inextricable from the music, which seemed to offer a rare glimpse into the imperfect union of perhaps the most famous\u2014and private\u2014couple in the world. And because we are a nation of voyeurs, it was almost impossible to look away.\n\nJay-Z\u2019s appearance in the intimate and painful visuals for the ballad \u201cSandcastles\u201d seemed to confirm the rumors, throwing an unexpectedly tender lens onto a man whose success had been largely built upon infectious swagger anthems and autobiographical rhymes about his trajectory from Brooklyn, N.Y.-based aspiring rapper and \u201cAmerican Gangster\u201d to international megastar and CEO. Jay-Z the untouchable. The aspirational. The undisputed (if repeatedly retired) king of contemporary hip-hop. The ego. (He has a big one, remember?)\n\nBut on 4:44, dropped at the stroke of midnight on Tidal, he opens by bidding farewell to both the image and ego that cemented him in the urban American imagination. \u201cBye, Jay-Z,\u201d he says, paving the way for a conversation he hopes to have \u201cin a place of vulnerability and honesty.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat vulnerability reaches its apex in the title track, a contrite tribute to his wife, punctuated by Hannah Williams\u2019 wailing refrain, \u201cI\u2019m never gonna treat you like I should \u2026 \u201d More than a song, it hits the body like a four-minute-long pang of regret; a rare revelation from the man who cavalierly quipped, \u201cI\u2019m a pimp by blood, not relation; y\u2019all be chasin\u2019, I replace \u2019em \u2026 \u201d Instead, a more muted and matured megastar now rhymes:\n\nI wasn\u2019t ready, so I apologize\n\nI\u2019ve seen the innocence leave your eyes\n\nI still mourn this death, I apologize for all the stillborns\n\n\u2019Cause I wasn\u2019t present, your body wouldn\u2019t accept it\n\nI apologize to all the women whom I\n\nToyed with your emotions, because I was emotionless.\n\nIt\u2019s a passage that personally cut me to the core, along with many women (and perhaps a few men) I know. It\u2019s the apology so many of us feel we deserved but have never received. It speaks to a grown man\u2019s accountability\u2014and 4:44 is undeniably a grown man\u2019s album. It is complete, self-aware and clear in its intentions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhether it is a response to Lemonade is perhaps irrelevant. But listening, I couldn\u2019t help wondering if it would create the same ripple effect of affirmation and empathy for black men as its counterpart, which was hailed as a testament to both the glory and painfully requisite resilience of black women. As Candice Benbow, creator of last year\u2019s viral Lemonade Syllabus (she\u2019s hoping brothers will create one for 4:44), wrote about these companion pieces:\n\nLoving him almost killed her. As it has almost killed so many of us. Sometimes, it does kill us. The cost of loving like we do. Loving men who ain\u2019t ready or willing to be loved like that. Miscarriages. Blank stares. Soulless bodies. Robbed of time and hope. Broken. The cost is too high. It\u2019s just too much.\n\nWith 4:44, Jay-Z attempts to own some of this cost, too: the cost of broken trust, lost faith and shame from becoming so lost in his legend that he almost \u201clet the baddest girl in the world get away.\u201d They are profound confessions from a powerful man; ones that will likely ultimately earn him far more than he\u2019s lost (materially, at least), just as his wife both earned millions and an even higher level of artistic acclaim with her own confessional. And that\u2019s OK. In fact, it\u2019s what artists (see: Adele, Taylor Swift, Kanye, et al.) do: They spin pain into pop-culture gold\u2014or, in this case, platinum.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut what of us mere mortals? In this case, women too brokenhearted to even feel like the baddest girl on the block anymore\u2014let alone the world\u2014and the men we so desperately love(d)? Will black men take from 4:44 the permission to love and be loved completely? Will their pain\u2014as well as our own\u2014be validated by the testimonials of one of the biggest hustlers to ever play the game? Will they accept from Jay the lessons he claims to have gleaned from the mistakes of Eric Ben\u00e9t and Michael Corleone? Will 4:44 be for black men the healing tonic that Lemonade offered so many women? Or will it end up another drop in the bucket of the \u201cStars: They\u2019re Just Like Us!\u201d culture we love to identify with?\n\n\u201cSee! We\u2019re messy and dysfunctional AF, too!\u201d\n\nBecause as cathartic as 4:44 might be\u2014and it is, from start to finish\u2014in the end, it still speaks to a love, commitment and contrition that many of us will never experience. Even if we have the love, most of us will never have the therapy, the money or even the time to pause and self-reflect as Jay alludes to. Too many men (and women) will never make the apology. And despite his highly listenable cautionary tale, too many will inevitably cut off their noses to spite their faces\u2014ironically, because they\u2019re always reaching for something newer, better and badder than even their soul mates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe pain revealed by both of these albums is sometimes excruciatingly relatable. And like his bars on black wealth, there is much wisdom to be gained from Jay\u2019s revelations about black love. But for many of us, this kind of reckoning and reconciliation remains as aspirational as any other celebrity trope or Hollywood romance. Because for all the anger, anguish and negotiation of their dueling confessionals, theirs is ultimately a love still firmly on top. And while that\u2019s a beautiful testament to (billionaire, heterosexual) black love, until we collectively do the work, most of us will end up forced to forgive ourselves for awaiting an apology we\u2019ll never receive\u2014and shouldn\u2019t have to be the \u201cbaddest\u201d to deserve. And as Benbow notes, that\u2019s a song far more bitter than sweet:", "keywords": ["tale", "fighting", "love", "apology", "power", "444", "lemonade", "vulnerability", "jayz", "thats", "cost", "women", "black", "men", "fairy"], "polarity": 0.12895195578231292, "subjectivity": 0.5263414115646257},

So much of what we see in television, film and music, particularly as it pertains to black women and femme representation, is distilled from the lived experiences of dancers who sell sex or the illusion of sex.\n\nIn her 1992 essay \"Selling Hot P\u2014sy\" (pdf), iconic feminist scholar and critic bell hooks talked about black women\u2019s sexuality being packaged for commercial use as \u201cbitchified\u201d prostitution, a sexuality that is violent and male-derived, detached from autonomy and romanticism, rendering it nothing more than a miming of toxic masculine desires, a broken mirror in which too many women anxiously try to see their authentic selves even though their images are distorted by the cracks of race, class and gender.\n\nFor hooks, the commercial success of sexual empowerment feeds a lie that black women tell themselves in a man\u2019s world that hates us but loves the money our bodies can make.\n\nShe recently revisited this theme in a critique of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Lemonade, writing:\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s all about the body, and the body as commodity. This is certainly not radical or revolutionary. From slavery to the present day, black female bodies, clothed and unclothed, have been bought and sold.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut when women own their bodies, when it is their choice whether or not to place themselves on the marketplace, can that be empowering? When it is for the \u201cgirl\u201d to \u201cget her money straight,\u201d is that freedom in a capitalist society?\n\nIs it feminism?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a strong, independent, intelligent and empowered woman, so yes, I\u2019m a feminist,\u201d Jaz, a former dancer at Magic City, Atlanta\u2019s most infamous strip club, told The Root.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJaz, who went on to earn two master\u2019s degrees and is now an IT project manager, said that men are \u201cmostly weak creatures\u201d who are easily tempted, so \u201cselling sex\u201d is not contradictory to feminism; nor does it strip dancers of their autonomy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no real challenge to tempt a man or coerce him to spend money for sex,\u201d Jaz said. The larger issue, according to Jaz, is a society where less focus is placed on \u201ceducation and personal empowerment\u201d and young women are encouraged to \u201cbare everything for everyone to see for free.\u201d\n\nAnd what of the claim that women take off their clothes to seek male validation?\n\n\u201cPeople end up in adult entertainment environments for a variety of reasons,\u201d Jaz said. \u201cSome do have low self-esteem. Some come from an environment where it\u2019s the norm, and some end up there out of desperation. I got a lot of ridicule from people who knew me before I started dancing. But none of those people were willing to help me when my back was up against the wall.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen asked about society\u2019s perception of her and other dancers, Jaz said that women were often the ones doing the judging.\n\n\u201cMen paid to look at me naked,\u201d she said. \u201cThey never touched me, and I wasn\u2019t into hooking up outside the club. I helped my daughter with her homework every night, we lived in a nice home and she went to good schools. There are a lot of women who are sleeping with men they aren\u2019t married to, [men] who cheat on them, and they are getting nothing in return. Their hearts are broken and they settle for the crumbs these men give them, but because it\u2019s done behind closed doors, they can hide behind it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had people try to berate me today over something I did 25 years ago,\u201d Jaz continued. \u201cI think that is more about their insecurity than mine.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSayuri, another former Magic City dancer who is the author of Scriptures for Strippers, said that the financial independence dancing gave her was empowering.\n\n\u201cI felt empowered by the fact that I was able to support my son and myself without having to answer to anyone regarding my schedule,\u201d Sayuri told The Root. But she also said that dancing naked in front of men left her \u201cfeeling vulnerable and only in control of myself.\u201d\n\nThat feeling of vulnerability, while navigating a scene that was becoming more about sex work than dancing, is the reason Sayuri finally left Magic City.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was a real struggle to stop dancing,\u201d she told The Root. \u201cIt took four different attempts before I actually completely transitioned out, which finally happened at the end of 2014. I now work with an organization called 4Sarah that assists women with transitioning out of sex work by providing housing, drug rehabilitation, scholarships and moral support.\u201d\n\nNow in the insurance field, Sayuri says that she feels more fulfilled than she ever has: \u201cInstead of investing in another permit to dance, I went for a career I can be proud of and help others prepare for their transition out of the club.\u201d\n\nShane, a dancer who has worked at strip clubs in Atlanta, Florida and Texas for the past 15 years and who also does sex work, is proud of her career.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf I could dance forever, I would,\u201d Shane told The Root. \u201cI sell fantasy and that works for me. I have sold my body, but I got it back. As long as I enjoy it and as long as it takes care of my family, I will.\u201d\n\nShane arrived in Atlanta with dreams of being a lawyer, but by her second year in the Atlanta University Center, she was dancing in Strokers, another popular strip club in Atlanta.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t come from a \u2018bad\u2019 family, nobody beat me and I haven\u2019t done one thing I regret. Every time I take that stage, I feel strong, sexy. And every time I leave that stage, I\u2019m paid. I don\u2019t punch a clock and I don\u2019t answer to anybody. I probably make more than half the men in the club, and I do it on my terms.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn multiple levels, black women who place a monetary value on their bodies are stripped of their voices. This becomes evident when so many public discussions about sexuality and power and how they exist, intersect and mutate in our society do not include them. Why? Because when patriarchy and misogyny are subverted by black women giving voice to their lips, hips and thighs\u2014instead of silently shaking something for the male gaze\u2014it makes many people uncomfortable. Further, some women benefit more from speaking for other women instead of listening to and engaging with other women.\n\nShane agreed that in the current debates surrounding feminism and sexuality, women like her are often ignored, but she doesn\u2019t let that bother her.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a feminist, but so many feminists want to \u2018save\u2019 dancers, when they don\u2019t even respect us,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to hear what we have to say, and that\u2019s fine. Because we don\u2019t owe anybody an explanation.\u201d", "keywords": ["stereotypes", "sex", "told", "psy", "selling", "sexuality", "hot", "strip", "work", "talk", "jaz", "misogyny", "dancing", "women", "dont", "black", "strippers", "men"], "polarity": 0.11296536796536798, "subjectivity": 0.4586796536796536},

Instead, they complained to other NBC staffers about the message, including the Roots\u2019 manager Keith McPhee. The next day they were called into separate meetings in the human resources department.

And NBC, terribly beholden to Questlove for some reason that isn\u2019t really articulated, listened and followed his orders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs evidence, they pointed their fingers at Roots bassist Mark Kelley, who also received the text message but wasn\u2019t fired or disciplined.

Cleon Brown claims that Police Chief Jeff Pratt called him \u201cKunte\u201d after the character in Alex Haley\u2019s Roots: The Saga of an American Family, while other officers whispered \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d and pumped their fists in the air as they walked by, according to MLive.com.\n\nThe mayor, who retired in January, also told racial jokes, Brown claims.\n\nFormer \u201cMayor [Frank] Campbell saw [Brown], smiled and said, \u2018Hey, I got a joke for you guys,\u2019 and proceeded to tell a racist joke using the word \u2018Negroid\u2019 at least two or three times,\u201d the lawsuit claims.\n\nThen there was allegedly an incident at Christmas when the department hung stockings with names of the officers on a Christmas tree, and a black Santa Claus figurine with \u201c18%\u201d written on its white beard was put in Brown\u2019s stocking.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrown has filed a federal lawsuit accusing defendants of state and federal civil rights violations and violation of the state\u2019s Whistleblower\u2019s Protection Act. He also claims intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n\nNamed in the lawsuit are the city of Hastings, Police Chief Jeff Pratt, City Manager Jeff Mansfield, Deputy Chief Dale Boulter and Sgt. Kris Miller.\n\nHowever, the city says Brown is the one who started the whole thing. Mansfield released a statement by the city insisting that the police chief ordered that the racial comments stop and that Brown had started the \u201cjoking and banter.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSgt. Brown, in a very joking and jovial manner, informed several of his fellow officers that he had recently taken a DNA test through Ancestry.com and the results showed that he was 18 percent African American,\u201d the statement read. The city also noted that Ancestry.com\u2019s website did not include \u201cAfrican American\u201d as a possible result.\n\n\u201cAncestry.com\u2019s website also states that the test results do not definitively reveal where a person\u2019s ancestors actually originated; only that there are shared characteristics in genes, which might or might not indicate a person\u2019s ancestors are actually from that geographic area,\u201d the city added, according to the news site.\n\nThe city claims that the topic would die down, and then Brown would once again bring it up, resulting in \u201cmutual bantering\u201d about officers\u2019 heritage. Brown, the city said, engaged in \u201ctypical racial stereotypes.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAfter a month or so of Brown originally bringing it up, even that ended,\u201d the city said.\n\nAs for the apparent Christmas fiasco, the city said that the black Santa was indeed put in Brown\u2019s stocking, but it was removed and an officer brought up concerns with the chief. However, according to the city, Brown told the chief that he was not upset and the city said that Pratt told Brown to be proud of his heritage.\n\nPratt then informed officers that there would be no more joking about the results, the city claims.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe officer who placed the Santa in Brown\u2019s stocking then went to Brown to apologize ... since he heard that Brown was upset. ... Sgt. Brown emphatically denied that he ever complained about it or that he was upset or offended by it and he even seemed confused that the issue was being raised,\u201d the city said, adding that Pratt was concerned that Brown was the one initiating the racial comments.\n\nThe city contends it is also uncertain as to whether Brown is truly considered a part of a protected class under civil rights law, even if the Ancestry.com test is valid, emphasizing that racial discrimination laws are \u201cnot designed to protect those who can demonstrate some trace amount of a particular race or geographic origin ... \u201d\n\nBrown\u2019s attorney, Karie Boylan, said that when the defendants became aware of the complaint, which was filed Jan. 4 with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the chief and deputy chief \u201cconducted highly coercive, offensive, intimidating employee interviews asking only leading questions.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoylan said that the defendants also \u201cunfriended\u201d Brown on Facebook and would not allow him to play at the annual charity basketball games. The city manager also ignored him, and the police chief either ignored him or was \u201ccurt,\u201d she said. Pratt also allegedly asked Brown to return to patrol officer, the lawsuit claims.\n\n\u201cBased on the openly hostile, retaliatory behaviors displayed by the defendants (the city manager, police chief, the deputy chief, one of four sergeants, and one of seven officers), and tacit approval of defendant\u2019s conduct by many other Hastings officers, it is more likely than not, plaintiff will not have adequate back up in the event of an emergency,\u201d Boylan wrote.\n\nBoylan added that the stress has affected her client\u2019s health and that he may not be able to continue working.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClick here to view this up.anv.bz embed.\n\nRead more at MLive.com.", "keywords": ["defendants", "cop", "chief", "test", "racial", "brown", "hes", "white", "taunts", "mich", "city", "faced", "lawsuit", "pratt", "officers", "showed", "officer"], "polarity": 0.051394335511982574, "subjectivity": 0.37801742919389963},

Janelle Mon\u00e1e, Taraji P. Henson and Octavia Spencer, the movie's three stars, were among the notable women on the panel, as well as the author of the book on which the movie is based, Margot Lee Shetterly.\n\nHidden Figures tells the incredible story of three brilliant African-American women\u2014Katherine Johnson (Henson), Dorothy Vaughn (Spencer) and Mary Jackson (Mon\u00e1e)\u2014who worked at NASA and were the brains behind the launch of astronaut John Glenn into orbit. The trio made history not only as women but as African-American women.\n\nDuring the panel discussion, the audience heard a bit about the lives and stories behind each character, especially concerning Katherine Johnson, who is celebrated in the film as the main source of intelligence behind one of the greatest operations in NASA history.\n\nHenson described Johnson as a courageous woman living in a time in history when accomplishments like hers were unheard of.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"You're talking about being the first woman in a room of all white men at a time where that was not popular. The courage to even walk in that room with your head held high,\" she said. \"I don't think many people could do that. Just the fear of 'What are they going to think of me?' or 'Will I make it?' The courage just to walk in that room speaks to her fearlessness, speaks to her tenacity, speaks to her brilliance.\n\n\"At the end of the day, you couldn't take her mind from her. You could call her all kinds of names and belittle her efforts, but she had a brilliant mind that God gave her. And she walked in that. She did not complain,\" Henson added.\n\nThe idea of Johnson not complaining was something that Henson emphasized and acknowledged that she learned and took away from in playing the role.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I use that in my life,\" she said. \"I don't complain about Hollywood. I don't say that they don't do this for black women and that and the third; I just keep working because one day you look up and you're a Golden Globe winner, you're Academy Award-nominated, but I couldn't get there by complaining.\"\n\nDorothy Vaughan, played by Spencer, was Johnson's supervisor, and Mary Jackson, played by Mon\u00e1e, was an engineer who also worked at the agency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen speaking of these three historic and inspiring women, Michelle Obama underlined the great dedication each had to their field, as well as their ability to maintain their poise during the racism and sexism that they faced at the time.\n\n\"Now, these women couldn't even drink from the same water fountain or use the same bathroom as many of their colleagues,\" the first lady pointed out. \"And folks didn't always take these women seriously because they were black and also because they were women. \u2026 But they didn't listen to those doubters, you understand? They did not listen to the haters.\"\n\nThe event was held in front of a small audience, much of it high school and middle school students. And so, fittingly, one of the main themes that seemed to be seen throughout the presentation was the importance of hard work and how far it can get individuals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"What also matters is how hard you're willing to work,\" Michelle Obama said. \"Because none of this is easy, and it's not supposed to be.\"\n\nWhen discussing hard work, the first lady referenced her own husband, President Barack Obama, and his diligent work ethic and serious commitment to his job.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Look at this eight years,\" she said. \"We were supposed to be 'hidden.' People didn't even want to believe we were real. But here we are, eight years later.\"\n\nObama further solidified her point, quoting Katherine Johnson toward the end of her remarks, saying, \"Stick with it; no matter the problem it can be solved.\"\n\nVeronica Graves is a digital-news associate at The Root.

Of course, to listen to it you had to either sign up for Sprint and why would you do that or have a subscription to Tidal, which is only slightly less unreasonable than signing up for Sprint in 2017. I\u2019m not the most reasonable chap, so way back in the day I signed up for the Tidal premium subscription and have forgotten to cancel it EVER SINCE LEMONADE DROPPED. Think about that, Lemonade came out in April 2016. For over a year, I\u2019ve been meaning to cancel Tidal and haven\u2019t and it\u2019s only been beneficial TWICE. Nobody will ever accuse me of solid decision making. Either way, armed with beats by veteran super-under-the-radar-top-tier producer, No I.D., Jay decided to give the summer some, one more time. And boy did he. I had no expectations and because of that, Jay reminded me why he\u2019s the GOAT.\n\nHere are 12 thoughts on the album everybody is going to be talking about for the next few weeks, and for good reason.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. This is the most quotable Jay album since The Black Album. And honestly, I thank Kanye for this. I\u2019m not going to say that Kanye made Jay-Z irrelevant, but \u2018Ye has leapfrogged Jay in terms of cultural relevance. A lot of it is due to the fact that Kanye is a self-contained creator. He moves the needle and sound, on purpose, when the mood suits him. He\u2019s a cultural icon because of how frequently he contributes to it. Jay has been on retired Godfather status - where he belongs - for a while now. But Jay is a competitor and you can\u2019t turn off your mind. Jay went in. He stepped it back up to Blueprint days, lyrically. It\u2019s also a lot more socially important than those magnificent misses from Kingdom Come and Magna Carta Holy Grail. Point is, the natural order of the hip-hop world is restored as, again, there is a Jay lyric to fit any situation, the way Hov intended.\n\n2. Good lord, No I.D. The hip-hop head in me thinks that No I.D. was working on an album in the vein of Dilla\u2019s Donuts, which is in my top five favorite hip-hop albums EVER. In that album, Dilla dropped a batch of his production ideas, concoctions that might not have worked super well as soundbeds for rappers but were perfect soundscapes on their own. To me, the production on 4:44 sounds like a bunch of ideas that No I.D. was playing around with. The samples are chopped up superbly; it\u2019s as if he loaded up samples into an MPC and chopped those joint into all 16 pads and went to work. In my head, Jay was talking to him one day and asked what he was working on, heard those beats, and said, \u201cLet me get those, all of them.\u201d\n\n3. I joked after Lemonade dropped that the Carter family was about to murder the game as soon as Jay dropped the companion album, Lemons. Well, it turns out that Jay did decide to give us Lemons, he just called it 4:44, and addressed it all in-depth on the song \u201c4:44\u201d. We can debate whether or not he needed to address Beyonce\u2019s album. I tend to think that he couldn\u2019t NOT address it and he did it in the best way possible, a head on collision with the truth. He even mentions Becky on the album. Obviously we assume Bey heard it and approved of the album before it dropped, but there\u2019s something about hearing him open up and acknowledge how fucked up he was and how much reflection he\u2019s done. It doesn\u2019t make it better, but it\u2019s also THEIR issue and THEIRS to deal with. Jay didn\u2019t owe any of us shit, but since he decided to share, I think he did about as good a job as he could on an album.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Motherfucking Frank Ocean (who after not being an artist I gave much of a shit about is probably the artist I listen to more than any other), used the word \"solipsistic\" on \u201cCaught Their Eyes.\u201d Nigga. Slow clap. Also, you are a lie. You who swears that you didn\u2019t have to look that shit up. I\u2019ve heard the word before. I even knew how to spell it, but I had to look that shit up because I had ZERO clue what it meant using context clues. Again, motherfucking slow clap to Frank Ocean, one of the absolute best phrasers in the game.\n\n5. As a beat head, I fucking LOVE the beats on this album. I\u2019m a sucker for a good sample use and No I.D. murked these samples.In particular, my favorites so far are \u201cThe Story of O.J.\u201d, \u201cCaught Their Eyes\u201d, \u201c4:44\u201d, \u201cFamily Feud\u201d, \u201cBam\u201d, \u201cMoonlight\u201d, \u201cMarcy Me\u201d, and let me say a little something about \u201cLegacy\u201d. GOTDAMN. Look, I love Donny Hathaway. I\u2019m a well-documented Donny stan. So if you\u2019re going to sample Donny, to me, you better use it well and shit. It seems like producers don\u2019t really fuck up Donny samples and \u201cLegacy\u201d is another in the line banging ass uses of a Donny sample. As a production head, I appreciate this album for being a nod to straight sampling without focusing on radio friendliness. Thank you, No I.D. and Jay for making an album in 2017 that could have come out in the 90s, the 00s, and obviously sounds good today.\n\n6. Well Jay had something to say about that Prince shit now, didn\u2019t he?\n\n7. This is a grown man ass album, but not in the way of Kingdom Come where it didn\u2019t really connect. Jay\u2019s obviously grown a lot since 2006, and the way he approaches talking about how he\u2019s living is more reflective and relatable now. As he said, he\u2019s giving you a million dollars worth of game for $9.99. And I appreciate that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. \u201cNever go Eric Benet\u201d - Jay Z, \u201cKill Jay Z\u201d. I wonder how Eric Benet feels about the fact that he\u2019s about to be heard around the internet for a very long time now as a reminder how he fucked it up with Halle Berry EVEN THOUGH nobody thinks he fucked it up by losing Halle Berry because of his sex addiction. I think we\u2019re all in agreement that maybe Halle does better solo than in a tandem. But still. Kinda sucks for Eric Benet.\n\n9. I\u2019m only 10 hours into this album but have listened 6 times as of this writing. I\u2019m sure many people are going to love the song \u201c4:44\u201d because of its vulnerability, but good gotdamn does \u201cThe Story of O.J.\u201d have so many gems and so much game in it. That song should change the trajectory of the bougie Black people in DC for at least this summer. There\u2019s also something hilarious about how he said, \u201cI\u2019m not Black, I\u2019m OJ!\u2026Okay.\u201d I laugh every time I hear it.\n\n10. It's cool hearing grown man, father rap, that sounds dope. Obviously this man is in love with his children and loves making sure Blue, in particular since the twins are just getting here, gets her due on record.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n11. Jay has 13 albums now. I\u2019m saying this is in his top 5. I\u2019m Reasonable Doubt over everything, then Blueprint, then The Black Album. As of right now, I have this as number 4, right before American Gangster.

Vague \u2018sources\u2019 have been quoted everywhere from Rap Up to Vanity Fair, claiming that the cursed release is set to have a surprise stream on Tidal. This is a particularly harmful threat to a long time Jay Z stan like myself, still nursing the trauma from his \"Poundcake\" verse and other erroneous features \u2014 like that limerick he gave Drake \u2014 that only serve as additional dents on his already battered legacy. To make matters worse, Jay Z has stoked more fear into the hearts of millions by offering a new verse on the remix of Fat Joe and Remy Ma\u2019s \"All The Way Up.\" Remy sounds better than ever, and even Joe sounds a bit refreshed. But Jay\u2026Jay offers the rap equivalent of a $25 Black Angus gift card. You're not gonna turn down that gift card, but its still Black Angus, so no one is getting excited about that shit.\n\nMy face contorted as I heard him name drop the success of his artistically better half's recent album, and the elevator incident..that Bey had also\u2026already mentioned. I audibly groaned when I heard him utter \"its survival of the littest\" and make a David Lachapelle reference that harkened back to the days where both he and VIBE were pop culture standards of excellence. Is this foreshadowing? Does this mean that Satan\u2019s busy ass is working a double shift and Jay is going to plague this world with a response to Lemonade or, even worse, a joint album with Bey? Each possibility is horrifying; a Jay Lemonade response is an unknown horror. Aside from \"Song Cry\" and \"Lost Ones\" we\u2019re not sure what else to expect of a Jay album that is supposed to mirror an arguable testament to the trials of his marriage. A joint album is a more familiar punishment, as Jay and Beyonce have miraculously managed to make some of the worst music of their careers with each other. I\u2019m also not fond of Jay sullying Bey\u2019s musical winning streak with his stench of recent wackness, need I remind you all of his \"Drunk In Love\" verse? Exactly.\n\nHowever, I feel a solo Jay project is more imminent. So, I have crafted some key suggestions to act as strikes against this orange level threat of new Sean Carter material.\n\n1. Kidnap Timbaland, and Justin Timberlake\n\nDeposit them into an unknown location for at least two to three years. Timbaland and JT are usual suspects when it comes to who Jay looks for when its time to make tepid music, as Timbo was largely responsible for Magna Carter Holy Grail. Maybe if they are not available, this will discourage him, and buy us some more time, until he goes to some monastery in Nepal to unearth Rick Rubin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Pay Foxy Brown to tail him and follow him to all his favorite studio locations.\n\nIf there's one person Jay seems to ignore and avoid on purpose, it's Foxy, theories as to why notwithstanding. She can serve as a powerful asset to the Stop Jay Z agenda. I\u2019d wager that she is not that quick to turn down a check, we can groupfund her payments. Perhaps the mere site of Inga Marchand and her steely piercing blue contacts glaring at him, while she\u2019s pacing back and forth in front of his creative spaces \u2014 and threatening to plunder him with her Louis Speedy bag \u2014 will hinder his process.\n\n3. Hack into Tidal\n\nUndoubtedly any and everything Jay releases will be a Tidal \"exclusive\" and I\u2019m sure he\u2019d want the roll out for such a project to go as smooth as possible. The anti Anti release. Hacking into the Tidal database (because according to all computer hacker movies, it\u2019s always the database or system mainframe) and shaking his confidence in the possibility of said roll out having a seamless execution will buy us time. I don\u2019t know exactly what message to send after hacking it, but make it something ominous. Post Peedi Crack mixtapes, recent Jaz O interviews. WHATEVER IT TAKES.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Remind him that Kingdom Come happened, and plea to his humanity\n\nJay hates Kingdom Come as much as we do. On his own Life and Times website, he ranked his albums from best to worst. Not surprisingly, Kingdom Come was listed as No. 12 with the caption \u201cFirst game back, don\u2019t shoot me.\u201d He knows. What Jay attempted with Kingdom Come is what he will likely attempt at a new album meant to be a response to Bey\u2019s Lemonade, a mature window into his adult life and his vulnerability. What resulted from such ambitions in the past is an album that should only be played as an act of mental warfare. The probability of similar wackness is very high. I propose we compile a short documentary, interviewing how Jay Z fans felt listening to the album, and how we\u2019ve learned to heal and move past it. Make it go viral, enter it into every pretentious film festival possible until he has no choice but to face our scars.\n\n5. Time travel\n\nI haven\u2019t sussed out all the details on the proposal yet. Just know that things can get very dark going down this road, and it is a point of no return.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSure my reaction might seem hyperbolic and my plans impossible to people with no imagination or faith in magic and technology. But, I\u2019m willing to do whatever it takes to prevent having to be subjected to my favorite rapper further destroying my youthful admiration with his aggressive mediocrity. A rapper of Jay\u2019s age even still maintaining a modicum of relevance for all these years in such a youth driven genre is a feat, yes I\u2019ll admit. However, seeing Jay become the rapper he is today is like seeing an aging Batman in a urologist's office.\n\nJay.

Everything is about to change\u2014or so it seems\u2014as designers present fashion shows featuring clothes generally intended to break the rules. But one thing rarely, if ever, seems to change, and that\u2019s the absence of black designers occupying top spots in the fashion industry.\n\nFreelance designer and journalist Kibwe Chase-Marshall recently published an op-ed in Business of Fashion\u2014one of the most respected media outlets for fashion-industry reporting\u2014titled, \u201cWhy Aren\u2019t There More Black Designers?\u201d It\u2019s a question I\u2019ve asked myself nearly every time I\u2019ve gone into work over my 30-year career in fashion. Why?\n\nAll too often, I\u2019m the only person of color on set doing any job. The rare exception is on the catwalk, where the sheer number of people required to produce a fashion show calls for hiring more than one black person, simply by default. But when the final bow is taken, it is almost never a black designer who has the chance to receive either kudos or a career-ending critique from the press.\n\nChase-Marshall\u2014who worked in high-level but never top-tier jobs, such as vice president or head designer, for firms like Michael Kors, Isaac Mizrahi and Oscar de la Renta\u2014found himself repeatedly slamming up against a glass ceiling. And now he\u2019s breaking that glass ceiling by breaking the silence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Jan. 3, an action-oriented social media campaign, #BreakSilenceBreakCeilings, went live. The campaign was conceived by Chase-Marshall and aimed at breaking the unwritten and unspoken rule of discriminatory hiring practices in fashion, an industry that Chase-Marshall says does not have a \u201cdiversity problem\u201d but, rather, a \u201cblack-people problem.\u201d\n\nHimself a talented technical draftsman, stylist and cutter, Chase-Marshall is not content to simply illustrate the talent of black designers as a solution to the problem. In February, I was on a steering committee for the Black Designers Exhibition and Symposium at the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology, which shed light on the fierce beauty of too-little-seen talent and started the conversation as to why\u2014but did not offer us a plan to advance the battle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChase-Marshall has tailored a solution to fit the problem, noting in his op-ed, \u201cFed up with watching this most blatant form of discrimination thrive, while the broader industry capitalizes on Black celebrity associations and the recent uptick in Black casting, I decided to do something.\u201d\n\nChase-Marshall, who stopped working full time in design studios in 2010 after 13 years, now makes a living as a freelance designer and writer for publications like Elle. He has devised a plan of action for the Council of Fashion Designers of America and Vogue, which collaborate on the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund, the most powerful entity in the American\u2014if not global\u2014luxury-garment industry, which has promoted some of the most successful black designers in recent memory, such as Tracy Reese and Cushnie and Ochs.\n\nChase-Marshall would like to see CFDA/Vogue adopt a program with greater oversight of its design-industry members, such as offering immersive training for hiring managers in elimination of bias, along with CFDA/Vogue\u2019s annual disclosure and endorsement of participating brands, along with annual statistics regarding the racial composition of their design teams.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s what the industry can do, but to consumers who want to take a stand against inequality and appropriation, Chase-Marshall posted:\n\nLet\u2019s do something: If you agree that it\u2019s time for the community of fashion design professionals to be taken to task regarding employment/advancement discrimination against qualified black candidates, along with liking this post, comment #breaksilencebreakceilings and tag @CFDA, @Voguemagazine, @Bof, @nytimes, and @wwd below. In addition, forward this post to 5 friends (or more) that you feel care to affect overdue change.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBlackness, until very recently, was seen as an unmarketable quality,\u201d says Chase-Marshall, who hails from Trinidad, was raised in Washington, D.C., and was a classmate of the Clinton and Gore children. But despite having the clubby connections to wealth and power that headhunters prize for their potential to move the needle when it comes to selling expensive designer clothing, he was discounted, simply because of the color of his skin.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if someone is racist,\u201d Chase-Marshall says. \u201cI care if people use discriminatory hiring practices.\u201d His is neither a call for affirmative action nor a call for quotas\u2014which can undercut recognition of real talent\u2014but, rather, a call for education transparency and accountability that can create lasting change within the fashion industry.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019m proud of Chase-Marshall for pushing us beyond merely saying that we have the right to more than just exist and be seen in the fashion industry. It\u2019s our responsibility to demand, not only of fashion but also of our trendsetting selves, that our spending be reflected in the identities of the images marketed to us, as well as that our dollars come back into our communities through the black talent being paid and promoted according to their true worth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInspired by Muhammad Ali and Colin Kaepernick, Chase-Marshall, who currently engages in every type of freelance work, from designing pull-up diapers to diamond rings, wants to be the kind of person who \u201cprioritizes their integrity over their paycheck.\u201d He broke his silence \u201cbecause you can\u2019t continue to play a losing game.\u201d Now it\u2019s time for the powerful consumers black women are to suit up and make the fashion industry play ball.", "keywords": ["problem", "hiring", "missing", "talent", "designer", "designers", "industry", "chasemarshall", "action", "black", "simply", "fashion"], "polarity": 0.12858133650387174, "subjectivity": 0.4944134503993659},

Henson and Janelle Mon\u00e1e\u2014had been sold. This comes as no surprise: The story of these brilliant African-American female \u201chuman computers\u201d who were instrumental in calculating the math necessary to propel rockets into space is fascinating. The only surprise is that this story has not been told before.\n\nNovelist Toni Morrison says, \u201cIf there\u2019s a book that you want to read but it hasn\u2019t been written yet, then you must write it.\u201d Enter Shetterly, who grew up in Hampton, Va., the site where this mathematical research was done\u2014and who also knew first-hand many of the black women who had been employed to do these mathematical calculations.\n\n\u201cThe idea that black women had been recruited to work as mathematicians at the NASA installation in the South during the days of segregation defies our expectations and challenges much of what we think we know about American history,\u201d writes Shetterly.\n\nSimply put, this book is the story she needed to write.\n\n\u201cAs a child, I knew so many African Americans working in science, math and engineering that I thought that\u2019s just what black folks did,\u201d writes Shetterly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis was her normal. There was Mrs. Land, a NASA mathematician who taught Sunday school every Sunday morning. There was Katherine Johnson, who worked on computing the trajectory for John Glenn\u2019s space flight. There was Dorothy Vaughan, who wrote the textbook on algebraic methods for the mechanical calculating machines used throughout the department.\n\nAnd these women are just the beginning.\n\n\u201cI can put names to almost 50 black women who worked as computers, mathematicians, engineers or scientists at the Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory from 1943 through 1980, and my intuition is that 20 more names can be shaken loose from the archives with more research,\u201d writes Shetterly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Shetterly is careful to note that what seemed normal to her did not come easily to this previous generation. Her father, growing up during segregation, had a passion for engineering but was told to become a physical education teacher instead.\n\n\u201cIn those days,\u201d writes Shetterly, \u201ccollege-educated African Americans with book smarts and common sense put their chips on teaching jobs or sought work at the post office.\u201d\n\nShetterly\u2019s father\u2019s love of engineering\u2014\u201che built his first rocket in junior high metal shop class\u201d\u2014would not let him give up his dream. Still, it was not easy: \u201cAs late as 1970, just 1 percent of all American engineers were black\u2014a number that doubled to a whopping 2 percent by 1984,\u201d writes Shetterly. \u201cStill, the federal government was the most reliable employer of African Americans in the sciences and technology: In 1984, 8.4 percent of NASA\u2019s engineers were black.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHidden Figures shines a much-needed light on the contributions of black women in science and technology that have been vastly overlooked. In prose that is engaging and compelling, Shetterly refutes the commonly held stereotype that STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) fields are the province of men, specifically white men. Black women have been doing this work for ages. Before desktop computers, black women were the computing machines, using their vast intelligence to determine the orbital trajectories of space flight and accomplish other leading discoveries in aerodynamics and engineering.\n\n\u201cEven as a professional in an integrated world, I have been the only black woman in enough drawing rooms and boardrooms to have an inkling of the chutzpah it took for an African-American woman in a segregated southern workplace to tell her bosses she was sure her calculations would put a man on the Moon,\u201d Shetterly writes.\n\nIt is this empathy with her subjects\u2014her ability to put herself in their shoes\u2014that brings the narrative to life. Steeped in history and thorough research, Shetterly also crafts richly drawn portrayals of these black women who were mathematicians, engineers and scientists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn vivid, specific detail, Shetterly paints the personal and professional lives of these black women who were vital to America\u2019s scientific advancement. We see their brilliance in their work; we see the ever-present institutional racism; we see the racist microaggressions from white colleagues; we see the inevitable \u201cColored Only\u201d signs on drinking fountains and bathrooms in their workplace Langley. And yet these women were responsible for some of the greatest scientific advancements of the age.\n\nThis is a book that should be required reading in schools\u2014both as a history of science and technology and an inspiration for young black women to succeed in STEM fields. This is history that needs to be told; this is history that is still an ever-present reality for women of color working in STEM fields.\n\nBy celebrating these black female \u201chuman computers,\u201d we give credit to the work of black women that has, like the achievements of black women in so many other fields, historically been ignored. In Shetterly\u2019s clear, vibrant prose, we have a compelling, thoroughly researched narrative that is in a class of its own. A groundbreaking, deeply inspiring read.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHope Wabuke is a Southern California-based writer and a contributing editor at The Root.

It\u2019s the first of its kind: a grown-ass hip-hop album.\n\nJay-Z isn\u2019t the first hip-hop star to try to do this; he is just the first to accomplish it. Common\u2019s Black America Again was close, but it was too aware of itself and too poised to blast in the car. A Tribe Called Quest\u2019s We Got It From Here ... was too reminiscent. We listened because it was Tribe. ATCQ is the rap version of Frankie Beverly and Maze\u2014they just make you feel good.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s not as if there isn\u2019t hip-hop that grown people can enjoy. Aside from Kendrick, J. Cole, Kanye and Chance, there are a million good, lesser-known hip-hop artists available at the touch of your smartphone\u2019s screen. But until today, hip-hop didn\u2019t have a legend who was still making great, relevant art. Where was our version of Mary J. Blige? Can we get a version of U2?\n\nJay-Z\u2019s 4:44 is the first time we\u2019ve heard a fully realized adult make relevant, popular music without desperately clinging to his youth or sounding like your uncle in the short set. He\u2019s the same Jay-Z, but a different Jay-Z\u2014as he should be. He\u2019s a grown-ass man.\n\nOpening with \u201cKill Jay-Z,\u201d he is introspective but still defiant, reminding himself that \u201cyou got people you love you sold drugs to.\u201d He is still a baller, but instead of popping bottles, he raps about how he has the only fully black-owned Champagne company. \u201cYou wanna know what\u2019s better than throwing away money at a strip club? Credit,\u201d he raps in \u201cThe Story of O.J.\u201d\n\nFinancial freedom our only hope/Fuck living rich and dying broke I bought some art work for one million/Two years later it\u2019s worth 2 million Three years later it\u2019s worth 8 million/I can\u2019t wait to give this shit to my children Y\u2019all think it\u2019s bougie and that\u2019s fine/But I\u2019m trying to give you a million dollars of game for $9.99\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis may be the most personal and honest Jigga we have ever heard. He fearlessly wades into the Lemonade controversy in the album\u2019s title track with a bare-chested, desperate, open-hearted apology taking responsibility for infidelity, his attitude and even one (or more) miscarriages. After revealing his fears about his children finding out about his cheating, he rolls into \u201cFamily Feud,\u201d with a Beyonc\u00e9 appearance on the track, with both of them reveling in the strength of the family they created.\n\nIn perhaps the album\u2019s most important and uplifting song, \u201cSmile,\u201d Hov raps: \u201cMama had four kids, but she\u2019s a lesbian/Had to pretend so long that she\u2019s a thespian,\u201d later adding, \u201cCried tears of joy when you fell in love/Don\u2019t matter to me if it\u2019s a him or her.\u201d His mother makes an appearance on the song, reciting poetry about how she spent her life \u201cliving in the shadows\u201d; and who else has their mother coming out on their album like Gloria Carter?\n\nProduced entirely by the legend No I.D., even the tracks are grown, using samples of Nina Simone, Stevie Wonder\u2019s \u201cLove\u2019s in Need of Love Today\u201d and Donny Hathaway. Jay didn\u2019t laden the album with features, as there are no guest verses, and when Beyonc\u00e9, Frank Ocean and Damian Marley make appearances, they serve complementary roles in the chorus.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though it is adult, introspective, loving and smart, the album still bangs. It is still a Hov album, and even though I am partial to the machine-gun, lyrical show-off, these may be the best songs he has ever made. It is defiant but under control; intelligent without being preachy. It is a man whose youth may have been one of the brightest we have ever seen, but instead of riding his legacy, he looks back and moves forward.\n\nJay-Z released Reasonable Doubt in 1996, and there is no other person in hip-hop who has enjoyed this much success for this long. Twenty-one years is a long time in any industry\u2014and in hip-hop it is unfathomable. I will not make the shortsighted declarations about where this album ranks in his catalog, but this album actually did what the first track suggested: It does kill Jay-Z, putting the iconic balling-out, collar-popping drug dealer to rest. But this new Hov is infinitely more interesting, because he is a grown-ass man.", "keywords": ["later", "long", "im", "1st", "version", "hiphop", "444", "grownass", "track", "jayzs", "album", "raps", "million"], "polarity": 0.21604894023725196, "subjectivity": 0.48173806712767764},

It is unclear who\u2019s responsible for posting the flyers, which were spotted on the New Jersey campus Monday, but they came in two varieties: the first, a personal attack against a Jewish resident of the city of Princeton; the second, an advertisement for a fake course at the university called, \u201cIntroduction to White Studies: White Guilt and Reparations.\u201d\n\nThe personal attack, titled \u201cThe Truth About \u2018White Privilege\u2019 and Jewish Supremacy,\u201d targets Linda Oppenheim. According to Forward, Oppenheim has worked on racial and justice issues in Princeton and has specifically promoted more pathways for racial inclusivity within the Jewish community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhoever targeted Oppenheim was familiar with her work and sought to discredit her.\n\nThe flyer, which the Daily Princetonian showcases in full, appears as one might expect\u2014littered with grammatical errors and lies, like the claim that 70 percent of the sexual predators who have been exposed in recent weeks are Jewish.\n\nAnd while your [sic] at it Linda, why don\u2019t you tell all your pet negroes about the overwhelming Jewish role in the trans-atlantic slave trade. Also you might want to discuss why Israel is deporting 60,000 black African jews from the Jewish state. Diversity and multi-culturalism is only for America and not the chosen people, Linda?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the Princetonian notes, the person or people responsible for posting the second poster, advertising the fake Princeton course, appear to be well-acquainted with Princeton-specific academic language and coding.\n\nThe fake course advertisement is meant to mock Princeton\u2019s liberal sensibilities. In describing the course, the poster states that it\u2019s time to \u201cexamine the oppressor society, to study Whites the way they have studied colonized people for decades.\u201d The flyer lists the course as \u201cYTS 305/WHS 201 (SA),\u201d which is consistent with Princeton\u2019s course coding, and lists homework as \u201cWeekly Blackboard Posts and Weekly Reparations.\u201d (I mean, it honestly doesn\u2019t sound like a terrible course.)\n\nFor the past year, racist, anti-immigrant and anti-Semitic flyers have been flooding America\u2019s college campuses.

In the lawsuit, plaintiffs claim that at CNN and other Time Warner units, African Americans receive lower performance ratings in evaluations, that there are huge discrepancies in pay between employees doing similar jobs but who are of different races, and that promotion for black employees is blocked by a \u201cglass ceiling.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Hollywood Reporter, the lawsuit, which was filed in December, cited hiring and advancement statistics. It also accuses superiors of hurling out racially charged comments to black employees, such as \u201cIt\u2019s hard to manage black people\u201d and \u201cWho would be worth more: black slaves from times past, or new slaves?\u201d\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter says that the CNN case may grow exponentially. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss the case or at least acquire more definitive statements about specific allegations. Defendants also allegedly argued that some of the claims may be barred by the statute of limitations, or by the fact that the plaintiffs did not fully exhaust administrative remedies. At that point, the plaintiffs stepped forward, telling the judge that they wished to file an amended complaint.\n\n\u201cSince the filing of this action, counsels for the plaintiffs have been contacted by more than 175 people, both former and current employees of the Defendant, requesting to be members of the putative class action, all having similar complaints of intentional racial discrimination, discrimination impact and discriminatory practices employed by the Defendants,\u201d the plaintiff\u2019s motion, which was filed in March, read.\n\nTime Warner has until April 14 to respond to the motion to amend the complaint.\n\nThe new development comes after Fox News was also slapped with a racial-discrimination lawsuit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast month, two black women filed a federal lawsuit in New York claiming that they were subjected to \u201ctop-down racial harassment\u201d in the organization\u2019s payroll department.\n\nTichaona Brown, a payroll manager, and Tabrese Wright, a payroll coordinator, accused now-former Controller Judith Slater of making several racially charged comments, including suggestions that black men were \u201cwomen beaters\u201d and black people wanted to physically harm white people, among other allegations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd, just Tuesday, another black female employee with the network\u2019s payroll department joined that lawsuit. New York magazine reports that Monica Douglas, a manager for credit collections, said that she was also subjected to years of racist comments at the hand of Slater. Douglas claims that Slater complained that she had \u201cblack eyes,\u201d in comparison with the \u201cAryan race,\u201d which has blue eyes and blond hair, and that Slater also called her Brooklyn, N.Y., neighborhood the \u201cmurder capital of the world\u201d and voiced \u201can unwillingness to even be near black people.\u201d\n\nVariety reports that Slater would also allegedly rub her hands in Douglas\u2019 hair and even kicked her in her backside as she walked down the hall. Slater is also accused of insulting Douglas\u2019 Panamanian heritage and mocking her accent.\n\nTo add insult on top of insult and injury, Slater reportedly even mocked Douglas about having a mastectomy as a result of breast cancer, calling her \u201cone-boobed girl\u201d and \u201ccancer girl,\u201d among other examples of ridicule.", "keywords": ["defendants", "performance", "filed", "ratings", "evaluations", "plaintiffs", "lower", "racialdiscrimination", "claiming", "receive", "slater", "employees", "lawsuit", "black", "cnn", "motion", "facing", "douglas", "payroll"], "polarity": -0.028256622832094524, "subjectivity": 0.34072190911813555},

For my money, few rappers could do what he did (pack that much substance into that many bars for that length of time and perform it so flawlessly) THAT well, and almost all of them are named Eminem or part of Slaughterhouse. I won\u2019t rehash all that he covered; that\u2019s been done already. But what has happened is that it should reignite a convo that exists in the rap community: Just where does Black Thought rank in the greatest-of-all-time conversation?\n\nOver the course of my life, I\u2019ve probably had a thousand \u201cWho is in my top five?\u201d discussions, give or take a hundred or so. At almost no time has Black Thought ever cracked my top five, which typically consists of Biggie, Jay, Nas, Andr\u00e9 3000, and Tupac or Ice Cube (AmeriKKKa\u2019s Most Wanted through Lethal Injection). There aren\u2019t any surprises on that list. It\u2019s a fairly standard \u201cmainstream\u201d list of GOATs.\n\nBlack Thought is as good as or a better rapper than every single person on that list. Yet he almost never makes my personal list, and based on the conversations I have, he typically gets left off a lot of other folks\u2019 lists, too, even extending them to top 10s. There are a few reasons why I think that\u2019s happened.\n\nFor starters, I think because he\u2019s part of such a great collective, the Roots, people sometimes forget to think of him in isolated terms. As an entity, the Roots are super beloved and appreciated, but we always lump them into one. Also because of their \u201cfirst hip-hop band\u201d image, I think sometimes Black Thought gets lost in that shuffle.\n\nWhen we think of the Roots, we think of Black Thought and Questlove, but we think of them in tandem and rarely of Black Thought as just pure rapper. Which is why I think every time he goes on shows and ends up spitting something, it stands out so much more. We are thinking of him as a solo entity in those moments, such as the Flex freestyle. Had Black Thought ever released a solo album, I think that might be different.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSecond, he\u2019s been so consistent for so long, spitting at such a high level, that even when you are paying attention to him, it gets easy to overlook just how skilled he is. Which also gets back to him being lost in the collective, so to speak. They make music that often caters so well to his vocals that he sounds more like an instrument than an MC bodying a track. It\u2019s like D\u2019Angelo on Voodoo.\n\nThe most controversial of reasons is this: He sounds ... unexciting. He\u2019s not a sexy pick. I\u2019m a Black Thought fan, but that everyman-show-up-to-work-every-day-without-any-pizzazz thing tends to push him into the \u201cYeah, he\u2019s tight, but he don\u2019t really spark\u201d convo that people like Tim Duncan fell into. Duncan is the Big Fundamental; his game had very little razzle-dazzle or spark, so it was easy to forget you were watching one of the best to ever do it for so long. Of course everybody knows Duncan is one of the greats, but he\u2019ll end up in those conversations in a more interesting way now that his career is over.\n\nI think Black Thought is similar in that sense. Plain and simple, he\u2019s just that damn good. That freestyle wasn\u2019t a revelation for most of us who are familiar with the Roots. It was a super-skilled MC doing what super-skilled MCs do: They get nasty on the mic. For others it may have been an aha moment, and that\u2019s good for him, and hopefully it translates into new fans for him and the Roots.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNone of the aforementioned reasons is particularly deep, but I think they are all relevant. Rappers in groups do struggle for that individual \u201cbest ever\u201d title, and it\u2019s usually when they step out on their own that we really start paying attention to their greatness. The catch here is that in the Roots, Black Thought has done the vast majority of the heavy lifting with assists from Dice Raw and Malik B., etc. Black Thought is primarily a solo MC in a band that we think of like a group.\n\nBut with freestyles like that one or any time he raps alongside musical guests on Jimmy Fallon or spits freestyles while on talk shows, you get the opportunity to appreciate just how special Black Thought is as an MC, IF he gets lost in the group shuffle. So here\u2019s the important question: Where DOES Black Thought rank in the GOAT convo?\n\nGlad you asked. For me? I think if Nas is in that convo, then so is Black Thought if I\u2019m being reasonable. I actually think Black Thought MIGHT be better than Nas, though Nas will always have Illmatic, which ensures his rap Mount Rushmore status for influence and impressiveness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBiggie will always be in my top five because I don\u2019t think there was a single weakness in his skill set, but I struggle with GOAT because of limited catalog, for obvious reasons. Jay is likely always going to be No. 1 because of how good he\u2019s been for so long and because of his cultural impact and footprint.\n\nBlack Thought, while being easily one of the most skilled rappers to ever do it, doesn\u2019t have the cultural impact piece, THOUGH the Roots are easily one of the most recognizable acts in hip-hop, especially as the backing band for Fallon. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re an unknown outfit. They have platinum and gold albums and six albums that opened in the top 10 on the Billboard pop charts, and 10 albums that opened in the top 10 of the R&B charts. Clearly, they\u2019re a band with a presence and are well-known enough to have an impact. Pretty much any outfit where rap is prominently featured out front and there\u2019s a backing band is following in their footsteps.\n\nHere\u2019s another thing: If you ask any MC who their top MCs are, Black Thought is more often than not going to end up in that number. So his impact is felt and he\u2019s universally respected as one of the best to ever do it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo what\u2019s the point of it all? It\u2019s this: While I think everybody is aware of and knows that Black Thought is a great rapper, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s gotten his just due in the conversations for GOAT. That Flex freestyle is a reminder why he should. If not for the pleasure, at least for the principle.\n\nBlack Thought is one of the best to ever do it; that\u2019s indisputable. Where does he rank on that GOAT list?

Oh, and Lemonade. We definitely talked a lot about Lemonade. Because it was FDALD (five days after Lemonade dropped) and both it and the conversations surrounding it were fresh on everyone's minds.\n\nDuring the Lemonade portion of the conversation, Jamilah expressed that she'd like to see a moment like that for Black men, where an ambitious, powerful, vulnerable, and important work that centered on our relationship lives was consumed, deconstructed, and treasured the way Lemonade has been.\n\nBut, as Jamilah and a few other panelists and audience members asked, who'd create it?\n\nOne reason why Lemonade has become such a landmark cultural moment is that Beyonce is firmly past superstar status and is now, inarguably, an icon. An institution. Everything she does, by virtue of her being the one doing it, is important. Lemonade is big as fuck because Beyonce is big as fuck. And while there are multiple Black male artists who are legitimate stars, none today are as famous and popular as she is.\n\n(Also, are we even sure that a Black male Lemonade moment would be wanted? A part of me feels like that type of deep dive into a Black man's emotional and spiritual journey in connection to his relationship life is something we (collectively) desire more in theory. Even if there was a guy as big and popular as Beyonce is right now, I have doubts that a similar type of work would be received the way hers has been. I just don't know if America is quite ready to see how that sausage is made.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyway, when you consider each of the criteria necessary to make something like this \u2014 popularity, platform, a level of stanishness possessed by the fans, a level of artistic and creative autonomy, a public history, a history of critical and commercial success, talent, tirelessness, ambition, and the courage to be as vulnerable as Lemonade is \u2014 we're left with six contemporary artists who could maybe, possibly, maybe create something like this. Kendrick Lamar, Drake, Jay Z, Kanye West, J Cole, and Frank Ocean. Each listed below, in order from \"least likely to make a Lemonade\" to \"most likely to make a Lemonade.\"\n\nJ Cole\n\nA case for why J Cole can make a Lemonade: Although the North Carolina-bred rapper is the least popular person on this list, he perhaps induces the greatest amount of stan-dom among his fans. They're basically Bernie Sanders supporters. He also seems to be ambitious enough to attempt to create that type of work. And he's lightskinned.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA case for why he won't: Because as talented as J Cole is, he's not particularly interesting. Or compelling. Or not \"not boring as all the fucks.\" Like, I can totally imagine him naming his Lemonade \"J Cole's Forest Hills Interpretation of Lemonade.\" Earnestness is good for a guidance counselor or a fireman in a movie about a family of fireman, but earnestness on wax is a fucking Ambien.\n\nFrank Ocean\n\nA case for why Frank Ocean can make a Lemonade: He seems to have both the potential for compelling personal experiences to pull from and the creative chops to pull it off. Also, he's currently pop culture's most vulnerable artist. You listen to Frank Ocean's music and you want to, I don't know, help him find an apartment on Craiglist cause he's new to the city and really struggling right now and needs a friend. He's practically a baby in an unstrapped car seat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA case for why he won't: No one \u2014 Frank Ocean included, apparently \u2014 is quite sure if Frank Ocean actually enjoys making music. Or if he's even alive right now.\n\nDrake\n\nA case for why Drake can make a Lemonade: He's the biggest Black male artist in music right now, so there's that. He also has the pseudo vulnerability thing mastered, so I imagine it doesn't take much to be actually vulnerable instead of a passive-aggressively subtle fuckboy with a Dominican uncle's torso.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA case for why he won't: Despite releasing the exact same album five different times, he's already the biggest Black male artist in music. So there's no real incentive for him to stop being a passive-aggressively subtle fuckboy with a Dominican uncle's torso. Also, I can't see any men over 35 not named Peter Gunz getting any emotional cues from his music. (At least not admitting to it.)\n\nJay Z\n\nA case for why Jay Z can make a Lemonade: Like anyone reading this wouldn't be interested in a 12 track version of his interpretation of the events that led to the creation of Lemonade. Remember that scene at the beginning of Mad Max: Fury Road when Immortan Joe was about to turn on the giant shower head and everyone was wanting underneath, desperate for any drop of water?\n\nThat would be me waiting for Jay Z's Lemons.\n\nA case for why he won't: He'd never do anything to throw his wife under the bus. Except, apparently, Becky With The Good Hair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKanye West\n\nA case for why Kanye West could make a Lemonade: He actually kinda did already. My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy was intended on being that type of watershed moment for him. It even came with a 35-minute film everyone forgot about but should definitely watch again now just to see how absurd and ridiculous it is.\n\nA case for why he won't: Kanye actually meets each of the criteria listed in the intro. He has the name and the platform, his fans have a streak of standom in them, he's pretty much artistically and creatively autonomous, he has a history of critical and commercial success, and he seems to possess the talent, tirelessness, ambition, and the courage to be as vulnerable as Lemonade is. To be honest, 808s and Heartbreak went even further down the emotional pit than Lemonade does.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut what's holding him back is that far fewer people wish to connect to his emotional journey. Because his antics and his personal relationships have turned a large percentage of his fans into either grudging fans or ex-fans. And even fewer people want to connect to the esoteric and increasingly inaccessible music he's mined from it.\n\nKendrick Lamar\n\nA case for why Kendrick Lamar could make a Lemonade: No one currently in pop culture is in a better position to craft this type of work and induce this type of response than he is. And it would be a natural progression to go from Good Kid, M.A.A.D City to To Pimp a Butterfly to a concept album articulating a Black male's relationship journey and each of the accompanying fears and anxieties.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA case for why he won't: He's a bit too young right now for that to connect with Black men in a way that Lemonade did with Black women. Also, considering some of the criticism he's received for some less than progressive things he's said about women and activism, I'm not quite sure if he's ready to make something like that yet.\n\nBut we'll see.", "keywords": ["vulnerable", "case", "type", "right", "frank", "lemonade", "create", "moment", "hes", "wont", "black", "music", "men"], "polarity": 0.06497423211708929, "subjectivity": 0.5198309626881056},

High School health teacher is learning that the hard way after being removed from the classroom after bragging on a Facebook post that he had failed two students more than a decade ago partially because they would not stand for the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\nNeedless to say, as Newsday reports, the post by 58-year-old Steven Solomon resulted in swift and immediate backlash. But, apparently, never one to quit while ahead, Solomon instead doubled down and defended his inexcusable actions, saying that he was trying to teach a lesson in patriotism that is currently being misunderstood in today\u2019s world.\n\n\u201cThese kids failed themselves,\u201d Solomon claimed, adding that the students\u2019 refusal to stand for the pledge was only part of the reason he failed them. He told Newsday that the students were mediocre and had behavioral issues.\n\n\u201cThey had a 63 or 62 ... less than passing,\u201d Solomon said. \u201cThey did not stand for the pledge. That was part of the component, and it\u2019s the teacher\u2019s discretion at that point whether they want to pass them or not.\n\n\u201cBut if a kid doesn\u2019t stand for the pledge, who said he doesn\u2019t care if these military people live or die, who doesn\u2019t respect his peers and is a discipline problem in the classroom\u2014why should I reward this kid?\u201d he added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWow, what a douchebag.\n\nThe controversial Facebook post, according to the report, referred to the students as \u201csuckers\u201d and \u201cunpatriotic.\u201d\n\nBut what is posted online is your own damn problem, and members of the public quickly contacted the school district, which took action.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe school district is aware of a teacher posting on social media about a situation involving grades and standing for the Pledge of Allegiance that occurred more than a decade ago,\u201d Superintendent William Lloyd said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cThe district has taken the proactive measure of assigning this faculty member to out-of-classroom duties until further investigation into the matter can be completed. The district will make available any information that is uncovered that can legally and responsibly be released to the public.\u201d\n\nStill, despite the ridiculousness of it all, Solomon is still a white man, and he was suspended with pay.\n\nAnd after all the backlash, Solomon has seemed to backtrack on his shitty actions just a bit, claiming that he didn\u2019t make the kids stand, even though his Facebook status stated that he \u201crequired\u201d the students he failed to do so.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t make them stand. They didn\u2019t stand. They sat,\u201d he said. \u201cI encouraged them to stand and I said your standing is just a respect for the country, the flag and for the military people that risked their lives to fight to protect your freedom.\u201d\n\nRead more at Newsday.", "keywords": ["failing", "suspended", "refused", "failed", "post", "solomon", "teacher", "stand", "high", "bragging", "facebook", "school", "pledge", "district", "newsday", "students"], "polarity": 0.0006705948372615037, "subjectivity": 0.44270061728395055},

But it bares repeating. Just in case anyone forgot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyway, since she's the shit and all, it's natural she'd be a writing ass chick I love too.\n\n\n\nDY: Since Saturday evening, both my Facebook feed and my Twitter timeline have been filled with Beyonce and Lemonade-related hosannas. Even those who usually feel the need to preface their Beyonce-related thoughts with stuff like \"I aint on Beyonce's dick like the rest of y'all\u2026\" are finishing those sentences with \"\u2026but Lemonade changed my life, b.\"\n\nThis, however, hasn't been you. At all. You've been very critical of it, especially the hour-long film accompanying the album. And if I recall you made similar criticisms when \"Formation\" dropped. So why aren't you drinking the Lemonade? Do you just hate nice things?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAS: I do hate nice things like the sunshine, fresh cut peonies and Black girl joy.\n\nSeriously, though. My feelings about Lemonade and a lot of Bey's recent stuff are complicated. Please keep in mind that I am not a Beyonce hater. I think she's beautiful, savvy and an exceptional performer.\n\nAnyway, I watched Lemonade twice. I hated it the first time and liked (but not loved) it the second time. The first time was the night it premiered. I had zero context about Warsan Shire's poetry, the multiple directors or the Oshun references. As a piece of art, I thought it was all over the place and I am sick of the gangsta-Bey novelty. As a piece of Black art, I thought it was another example of how poorly Bey deals with skin-color politics and antebellum imagery.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStarting with \"Formation\" and the Superbowl performance and now with Lemonade, Beyonce has been doing this very particular thing of reinforcing color hierarchy by using groups of darker-skinned, similarly styled women with afros or some other \"natural\" hair as background noise.\n\nIn \"Formation\" the video and the Superbowl show, Beyonce doesn't place herself in community with these women. The lighting, her position, her lighter skin and long straight blonde hair make her the queen. That's superstar stuff, but people want to make this stuff Nina Simone-level Blackness\u2014just without the sacrifice.\n\nDY: But couldn't someone make the counterargument that the juxtaposition exists because Beyonce is the star and they're literally the background? That she feels a kinship with these women. But since they're her background dancers, both the uniformity and them existing in the background are understandably intentional?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAS: The \"Formation\" lyrics\u2014\"Mix that Negro with that Creole make a Texas 'bama\"\u2014tell a different story than one of that type of kinship. Beyonce is literally saying that Creole people are not regular-Black but special-mixed Black. Her construction makes it seems as if there is no privilege attached to being a more European-looking Creole rather than a West African-presenting Black 'bama. Like, \"yay, we're all mixed and equal and pretty.\" We all are mixed and pretty. But it's bullshit to imply that we're regarded equally amongst ourselves and the overall trick bag of White supremacy. Bey did not invent the Creole idea.(Read this essay by Dr. Yaba Blay, a dark-skinned New Orleanian of Ghaniain descent and a scholar of skin-color politics.) But it's still troublesome to me.\n\nThe color thing happens again in the Superbowl performance. The darker-skinned women are now wearing black berets over fro wigs and black pleather booty shorts. Despite the Black Panther allusions, Beyonce, maintains her signature long, straightened blonde weave and rocks a special bodysuit that looks like it's from the Jacksons' Victory Tour. That juxtaposition makes the 50 or so darker dancers part of the set rather than actual human women.\n\nIn Lemonade, she does this on the bus with the darker women in the body paint and various African hairstyles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen she takes things a step further by having Serena Williams\u2014one of the best athletes in the world and a dark-skinned woman frequently called ugly, mannish and a monkey\u2014twerk and body-roll as she sits on a throne doing no such labor. People have argued that Beyonce is giving props to Serena because at one point she drapes herself over the throne the way Serena did on her Sports Illustrated cover. Plus they say that Serena \"wanted this.\" And, OK. Serena Williams clearly does whatever she wants. But none of that context explains why Serena is a twerk-maiden for most of her time in the video.\n\nFinally on this, her constant antebellum imagery is confusing and it's romanticized. Here we see Beyonce sitting in the center of group of darker women fanning herself. Or Beyonce alone, fanning herself. Or Beyonce bragging about Guivinchy (sp?).\n\nI'm not a historian, but these images remind me of placage, quadroon balls and/or the fancy trade. I'm unclear why Beyonce is going back to this.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo the colorism and antebellum weirdness bother me, especially given how so many Black folks want to cast these cultural products as the ultimate declaration 360-degree Blackness\u2014old Black, new Black, Afro-Futurist Black, Feminist Black, Rich Black, Slaying Black, Queer Black, 'Hood Black, Southern Black, Real Black.\n\nYes, Beyonce is Real Black. But colorism and historical myths are Real Black too, and they suck.\n\nDY: In your first answer you mentioned that your thoughts on Lemonade have shifted a bit since your first viewing. That you see it in more of a positive light now. (Or, rather, less of a negative light.) What changed?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAS: I watched it again a couple nights ago after skimming a billion think pieces and think-posts. I felt I was missing something. I was. This project isn't as disjointed or unintentional as I thought and there's a lot of symbolism I haven't been exposed to before.I can now see why people are losing it. It's an often beautiful piece with powerful scenes of Black male vulnerability, moms mourning their children slain by racist police or vigilantes, performance, love in many forms, baptism and Black women bonding.\n\nI still feel the same about the color politics and antebellum shit, though.\n\nDY: So, since you don't like sunshine, fresh cut peonies, Black girl joy, and Beyonce's Simply Creole Raspberry Lemonade all that much, what does catch your fancy right now?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1.

Last year, Sprint announced that it was partnering with Tidal to offer the streaming service to Sprint customers, servicing customers with premium content.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s no release date for the movie, but it definitely got fans of Ali all worked up because of the boxing scene.", "keywords": ["partnership", "tidal", "mahershala", "fans", "clip", "commercial", "444", "jay", "sprint", "ali", "appeared", "hints", "film", "danny", "lupita", "customers", "nyongo", "glover"], "polarity": 0.020670995670995673, "subjectivity": 0.28279220779220776},

It has been overlooked for too long, but it\u2019s time that someone called attention to this rapidly spreading illness:\n\nBlack people who can\u2019t dance.\n\nWe all have a friend or relative who looks like they\u2019re being stunned with a Taser whenever they hear \u201cCash Money Records taking over for the nine-nine and two thousand!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFar be it from us to engage in rhythm-shaming. There is nothing wrong with not being able to dance. But we thought we\u2019d look at some of the more famous entertainers who\u2014despite their level of stardom and talent\u2014are stricken with what poet and amateur scientist Jonathan Samuel Eddie diagnosed as \u201crheumatoid Negroitis.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the list of the greatest nondancing entertainers:\n\n10. Rihanna\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s not that Rihanna can\u2019t dance. Rihanna looks like she just doesn\u2019t give a damn about dancing. Rihanna is from Barbados, so anything past the dutty wine level of difficulty looks like she\u2019s just biding time until she\u2019s free to jump on a Jet Ski and hit the joint she keeps tucked in her bra.\n\n\n\nTo be fair, after you\u2019ve smoked half a blunt, every dance step feels like you are Fred Astaire. And Rihanna never smokes half a blunt. She always goes all in. That\u2019s why she\u2019s the queen.\n\n9. Johnny Gill\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen God handed out singing ability, apparently Johnny Gill got in line twice instead of waiting for his allotment of dancing skills. No one can impugn Gill\u2019s vocal chops, but he dances like he\u2019s the son of a preacher. There is no middle ground for preachers\u2019 kids. Either they can twerk like the Friday midnight main feature at Magic City or they dance like they have two left feet. Gill\u2019s gyrations will make you say, \u201cMy, my, my ... that nigga can\u2019t dance!\u201d\n\n\n\nIn defense of Gill, as one of the last holdouts to get rid of the S-Curl, the activator drips that surrounded him made doing the running man very precarious.\n\nGod, that brother can sing, though!\n\n8. Mary J. Blige\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWho doesn\u2019t love Mary J. Blige? It\u2019s not that the Queen of Hip-Hop Soul can\u2019t dance, it\u2019s that she\u2019s created her own genre of dance moves that is a mix of karate and being gone off the Henny.\n\nThe countless memes of people mimicking Blige\u2019s dances are always hilarious.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. P. Diddy\n\nSean \u201cP. Puff Daddy Diddy Brother Love\u201d Combs moves like he caught the Holy Ghost while a Junior M.A.F.I.A. song was playing. Unlike many people on this list, however, Brother Diddy Love seems to believe he is good at dancing, and\u2014to be honest\u2014he might be. Diddy always looks as if he just learned the dance routine in rehearsal, but when he gets all the steps down and memorized, he\u2019s going to slay it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe never gets it down.\n\n6. Whitney Houston\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe golden-voiced diva possessed one of the greatest set of vocal cords of all time. Like Johnny Gill, she didn\u2019t bother to bring her dancing shoes anywhere. With Houston, it didn\u2019t matter, because we all fast-forwarded through her up-tempo songs anyway.\n\nI actually do want to dance with somebody who loves me ... but not to that particular song. Plus, if I see Houston cutting a rug, it might get me out of the mood.\n\nWe will still always love her.\n\n5. Boyz II Men\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is another example of great voices who just didn\u2019t have it when it came to dance-floor charisma. Boyz II Men aren\u2019t supposed to be able to dance. They\u2019re supposed to stand in the middle of a field of dandelions and sing to a camera circling around them. They are supposed to stand on the beach in white linen and serenade the ocean breeze.\n\nSure, they might look like they just ate a family-sized bucket of Church\u2019s chicken before their performance, but as long as they\u2019re in tune when they sing \u201cEnd of the Road,\u201d no one cares if they\u2019re in step when they sing \u201cMotownphilly.\u201d\n\n4. Drake\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDrake is one of the worst dancers on the list. Heavy D rolled over in his grave when he saw Drake\u2019s \u201cHotline Bling\u201d video sullying the dancing legacy of light-skinned entertainers like Christopher \u201cKid\u201d Reid of Kid \u2019n Play, Chris Brown, Prince and post-Thriller Michael Jackson.\n\nDrake gets a pass because he dances exactly like who he is: an emo, half-Jewish Degrassi High child actor from Canada.\n\n3. Q-Tip\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQ-Tip is one of the coolest figures in hip-hop history, but he dances like Frankenstein at the disco. It doesn\u2019t matter because A Tribe Called Quest is not known for dancing. He only made it this high on the list as a warning. There are men who look so cool, when they do something, you will sometimes mistakenly think the thing they are doing is cool. Please, I beg of you, don\u2019t go to the club on Friday night thinking you look as cool as Q-Tip when \u201cVivrant Thing\u201d comes on. You don\u2019t.\n\nAlso, why are you at a club that still plays \u201cVivrant Thing\u201d?\n\n2. Lil\u2019 Kim\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLil\u2019 Kim is the impetus for this list after a clip of a recent performance became a meme:\n\nI cannot confirm the rumor that Lil\u2019 Kim will replace Derrick Rose on the Cleveland Cavaliers roster.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. Mariah Carey\n\nMariah Carey doesn\u2019t even try. She sleepwalks through her show like she\u2019s high on Percocet and red wine. Mimi has so few fucks left to give that she is known to just say \u201cScrew this\u201d and let her backup dancers carry her through the performance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut if given the choice, which do we prefer: watching Mariah Carey zombie-wobble though the running man in 7-inch heels or hearing her hit those exquisite high notes?\n\nI admit that I\u2019m biased because me and Mariah go back like babies and pacifiers.", "keywords": ["worst", "look", "shes", "theyre", "love", "dancers", "looks", "dance", "sing", "black", "dancing", "rheumatoid", "music", "rihanna", "list", "negroitis"], "polarity": 0.16432659932659932, "subjectivity": 0.5259090909090908},

Lemonade is basically her 73 home run season. And that it came from the same person who created \"Soldier\" and spent the first decade of her career saying things like \"Nice things are nice\" in interviews will never not be amazing. And suspicious.\n\nWhat is Lemonade?\n\nRemember when you were a kid, and your grandma left you alone in the kitchen, and said \"don't take any cookies from the cookie jar,\" but there were like 17 cookies in the jar, so you took one thinking she wouldn't notice, but when she came back in the kitchen you started acting all guilty like you know she knows you took a cookie? Well, if you're a man in a relationship with a woman, both Lemonade the album and the short film are that cookie jar. The only other thing that's ever made this many men this self-conscious is Lexington Steele.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt's that bad, huh?\n\nLet's just say that 60% of the men in America are spending this week vacillating between feeling bad for Jay Z and being mad at Jay Z for doing whatever he did with Becky With The Good Hair and putting the spotlight on all of us. It's one thing to do some fuckshit when you have 600 million to fall back on. You might be forgiven. You'll be memed. But forgiven. It's another thing if your girl is paying your wifi bill. And your Netflix bill. And your electric bill. You have much less of a rope. You're practically ropeless. And there are A LOT of ropeless niggas out there, and I'd imagine they're all very mad at Jay Z.\n\nI see. Wait\u2026who is Becky With The Good Hair?\n\nBecky With The Good Hair is apparently the woman Jay Z cheated on Beyonce with. As far as who Becky With The Good Hair actually is, Sunday it was apparently Rachel Roy. (And then, for like 15 unfortunate minutes, it was Rachel Ray.) Monday it was Rita Ora. And perhaps by Thursday it'll be Gwyneth Paltrow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInteresting. All of these women have nice hair I guess, but none of them are named Becky. So why Becky With The Good Hair? Where does \"Becky\" come from?\n\nFor years, \"Becky\" has been used as a general reference for a particular type of White woman.\n\nWhat type of White woman? What's the criteria?\n\nIt's actually easier for me to say whether a White woman would be considered a Becky than it is to explain the criteria. Hillary Clinton? Not a Becky. Natalie Portman? Not really a Becky. Taylor Swift? The Beckiest. Iggy Azelea? Darth Becky. There are several theories on its etymology, but the one that makes the most sense is that it stems from the first line of \"Baby Got Back.\"\n\n\n\nOh, my, god. Becky, look at her butt\n\nI see. Well, it's fitting that you called Iggy Azelea \"Darth Becky,\" because she's in the news today for claiming that using that word is racist. Do you think it is?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDo I recognize the irony in Iggy Azelea \u2014 the hip-hop equivalent of cucumber salad wrapped in a week-old chitlin \u2014 calling something racist? Yes! Of course I do. But is the use of Becky racist? Well, no. But it's complicated.\n\nComplicated how?\n\nThere are two schools of thought on what qualifies something as racist. The first is that something is racist if the act stems from either a belief of racial superiority or a position of constructed/structural racial superiority. (Or both.) The second encompasses all unfavorable acts which might be race-based. Basically, one school of thought is right (the former) and one is wrong (the latter).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd it's not a surprise that the rapping Quiznos frappuccino would be wrong on this too.\n\nSo it's the difference between something being truly racist and something being racially insensitive, but not actually racist?\n\nYes. Admittedly, referring to White women as \"Becky\" isn't particularly nice, but it's ultimately a reaction to a certain type of privileged young White woman who exists in a state of racial obliviousness that shifts from intentionally clueless to intentionally condescending.

Residents of Philadelphia will take to the streets Monday afternoon to protest the imprisonment of the rapper and notorious collector of L\u2019s after the hip-hop star was imprisoned on parole violations.\n\nBorn Robert Williams, the emcee was sentenced to two to four years for violating the conditions of his parole in a 2008 weapons case. Mill was arrested in March for an altercation at a St. Louis airport, but charges were later dropped. In August of this year, Meek was charged with reckless endangerment after a traffic violation on a motorcycle.\n\nSupporters argue that Mill\u2019s sentence is too harsh, while lawyers for the star say that the judge has an unusual \u201cobsession\u201d with the case. Attorney Joe Tacopina told Billboard magazine that Judge Genece Brinkley is \u201cenamored\u201d with Meek after he recorded a song that mentioned her by name. Tacopina also states that Brinkley has shown up at Mill\u2019s court-ordered community service and even requested that Mill drop Roc Nation as his management and sign with a local manager with whom she has a relationship.\n\nCelebrities and activists have spoken out against the unusually harsh sentence. Billboard reports that Philadelphia Eagles safety Malcolm Jennings, known for his social activism against injustice and mass incarceration, plans to attend the rally, as well as 76ers legend Julius \u201cDr. J\u201d Erving.

The current owner, Jerry Richardson, is going to put the club up for sale after reports of several payouts being made to victims of sexual misconduct came out via Sports Illustrated.\n\n2017 is definitely the year of getting creeps out of there. Owning an NFL team puts you in rare air. There are only 32 NFL franchises, so getting into that club is both exciting and difficult as hell. And white.\n\nWith the news that the Panthers are going to be up for sale, Sean \u201cDiddy/Puffy/Puff\u201d Combs (we will call him Puff in this article) posted a video and tweeted his interest in becoming the next owner of the Panthers. Steph Curry, a Charlotte, N.C., native, also wants in. Glory day.\n\nPuff is a very, very rich man\u2014his reported net worth is almost $1 billion (around $820 million)\u2014but the Panthers are worth an estimated $2.3 billion. Puff is going to have to put together a solid team of folks to make a reality where he could maybe be the primary owner.\n\nFor the record, I do think it can happen\u2014financially, at least\u2014but I wonder if the league would welcome the mogul to the table. All of that has to be sorted and worked out in the coming months. But for now, I can dream and shit. Here are 10 reasons that this needs to happen. The NFL probably doesn\u2019t even realize that it needs this to be a thing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. It immediately makes Charlotte a cooler place.\n\nLook, I like Charlotte just fine. It\u2019s a swell city. Lush and shit. Very nice foliage. The CIAA tourney is awesome, and I know some absolutely wonderful people from the city. A few years ago, Charlotte was supposed to become the next Atlanta. I think we can all agree that never happened. Puff immediately fixes that problem. LeBron went to Cleveland and folks looked at Cleveland like, \u201cYou know what? Maybe I should holler at Cleveland.\u201d Same shit. All kinds of famous folks might stop through Charlotte just to holler at Puff.\n\n2. Puff might single-handedly lift the Charlotte nightclub economy.\n\nPuff is no spring chicken, but does anybody think that this man couldn\u2019t (or wouldn\u2019t) go out partying seven days a week in a place like Charlotte just to find something to do? He\u2019d have to set up shop and roots down there and stay during the season at least, I\u2019m guessing. I\u2019m not sure if Puff ever sleeps anyway, so he\u2019d have to find something to do. He\u2019d stop at different clubs and food spots and spend all kinds of money, and his folks would do so, too. I\u2019m just saying, there is no nightlife downside to this.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. Ciroc everywhere!\n\nWhile I\u2019m a brown-liquor fellow myself, it seems like many of you still drink that white. We all know Puffy is the main marketer and promoter for Ciroc. Half of you think he OWNS it. He\u2019d mess around and turn Charlotte into the Ciroc capital of the world, taking that title from the Park at 14th in Washington, D.C., which has so much of the shit that I\u2019ve literally been handed free ENTIRE bottles on several occasions.\n\n4. Cam Newton could finally have somebody sit his ass down and get his fashion right.\n\nI realize this is No. 4 on my list, but we all know this is one of the biggest upsides. You remember how the current owner wanted Cam to stay straight-laced with no tats and shit. Well, maybe Puff would encourage Cam to get tatted up, and that might even out his style or something. Or maybe Puff would become the outfitter for all of the Panthers players or something. I don\u2019t know. But anything that helps Cam stop Cammin\u2019 it up fashionwise can only be seen as a net positive for not only the league but mankind. And if Cam is your fashion spirit animal, just fucking stop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. The games would be just as exciting for who might be there.\n\nPuff\u2019s box would be the most insane box of all time. I\u2019m talking DJs, good food and drank and celebs all the time. Random folks would come through on Sundays to attend Panthers games. Pharrell? Mary J.? Barack Obama? Who knows? The possibilities are literally endless because of the sheer number of people Puff has connections with.\n\n6. The Charlotte music market might get much-needed glow.\n\nI don\u2019t know anything about Charlotte rappers. I think Big Daddy Kane lives down there, but I could also be making that up. Point is, every artist in Charlotte and the surrounding areas and into South Carolina would be trying to get to Puff, so they\u2019d all have to step their games up. But what if Puff decided to randomly show up at events and shows and look for some burgeoning new acts of any type? Lordt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. Atlanta is a three- to three-and-a-half-hour drive, and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s much quicker by private jet, and I\u2019m sure Puffy has access to one, but I don\u2019t, so I always drive.\n\nBruh. Atlanta would even catch some of the shine here. Puff could wake up and be like, \u201cYo, I want to go to Spondivits this morning,\u201d and be there on a private jet in, like, 15 minutes. NOBODY LOSES HERE!\n\n8. This opens the door for more opportunities for blacks in positions of power in the NFL.\n\nYou want to put the right football people in the right positions to win. But I think there\u2019d be a natural tendency for a black owner, especially like Puff, to look more favorably on qualified black applicants for jobs. What\u2019s better than one billionaire? Two. Especially when they from the same hue as you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. Bruh, the halftime shows.\n\nLet\u2019s be real\u2014you and I BOTH know that Puff is gonna require himself to be part of the halftime shows at least once a season. At least. They might fuck around and catch a Super Bowl in Charlotte. Assuming they can get their inclusion policies together. North Cack is still North Cack.\n\n10. Most importantly, this would really test white folks\u2019 love for football\u2014IN THE SOUTH.\n\nCan you imagine\u2014and this is probably why it wouldn\u2019t happen\u2014white people up in arms at any changes Puff might want to make to anything? The racism and trolls would come out in full force, but they wouldn\u2019t be able to do shit because Puff is Puff and would be franchise owner.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDear racist white people, (potentially) take that, take that.", "keywords": ["diddy", "cam", "panthers", "know", "think", "charlotte", "im", "thing", "combs", "owner", "carolina", "folks", "buying", "sean", "shit", "needs", "reasons", "puff"], "polarity": 0.10013413354322442, "subjectivity": 0.5288600288600287},

Since Saturday night, social media has been ablaze with tweets, IG posts, and commentary about Yonc\u00e9 and the latest addition to her catalog.\n\nI had some thoughts. And because sharing is caring, I will share them, though all of these are less specific to Lemonade and more about everything surrounding Lemonade. I guess I\u2019m a white journalist.\n\n1. I was one of those people who \u2018pacifically did not get Tidal. On purpose. I was already paying for Spotify and because of that there\u2019s almost no reason to get Tidal, even for those artists who exclusively release music via Tidal. I have all of Jay, Kanye, and Beyonce\u2019s albums. I managed to download The Life of Pablo without subscribing to Tidal so I was ahead of the game. And let\u2019s be real, none of these people are stupid; limiting your musical output to one single streaming service shortchanges a money stream. They are all business people on top of being musicians. Well, this shit all changed on April 21. Prince died. I shed a few purple tears. And then I started reading about how none of his music was available anywhere ELSE but Tidal. Prince was all about being an artist who controlled his art, so any service that purports to be artist-centric in terms of paying artists, well, The Purple One was about that life. If he says Tidal only, he means Tidal only.\n\nSo on Friday, April 22, I got Tidal. I own several Prince albums on compact disc. If you\u2019ll remember, I have yet to open up my boxes of compact discs since moving into my home. I wasn\u2019t about to wade in those waters (children wade) so I put on my big girl panties and accepted that this is how big of a deal Prince is: he made me get Tidal.\n\nThis is getting long \u2013 and yes Virginia, that\u2019s what she said \u2013 but this is how much of a great person Prince is, even in death. Because I had to get Tidal to listen to Purple Rain, that means that when Lemonade dropped on Tidal, I was ready to go and devoured it without having to deal with the \u201cdammit I have to get Tidal for this!\u201d mental machinations. See, because I love Prince, I wasn\u2019t even mad I had to cop it to listen, Prince said he\u2019d die for me (or u); the least I could do was up Tidal to listen. On Saturday night? Totally worth it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll this to say, thank you, Prince.\n\n2. Part of the fun of artistic consumption these days is the social engagement of it all: we\u2019re all watching and listening to these things together. This is both a gift and a curse. It\u2019s a gift because the internet is FULL of the most hilarious and comedic minds ever. It\u2019s a curse because groupthink is real: folks take one story and run like Michael Johnson in 1996. Those of us who were watching were all (yes all) like, is Beyonce about to end this bitch with a sign that says \u201cJay and I are done\u201d??? It\u2019s definitely her most personal output to date, by far. But I had to re-center myself half way through. It took them motherfuckers YEARS to even acknowledge they were married publicly, all of a sudden Beyonce is gonna put ALL their business out on front street? I don\u2019t care how pissed she is (or has been) at Jay, that\u2019s a tall order for a couple of the most famous and powerful people in the entertainment industry and world who enjoyed years playing coy.\n\n3. The visuals for Lemonade are absolutely amazing. Stunning, even. Once I finally figured out what the hell was happening, and yes it took me a second, I was able to step back and truly appreciate the art being presented. Shit was beautiful. The weaving of the songs into the poems by Warsan Shire, who I\u2019d never heard of before Saturday night (similar to Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie before \u201cFlawless\u201d \u2013 thank you Beyonce), was super well done. Queen Bey and her team put their foots all up and through this short film. And even though Deep Beyonce is a hard sell, it still worked beautifully.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. With that being said, listening to the the album as part of the visual presentation is better than when listening to it without them. This is NOT to say that the album isn\u2019t good. It's a super personal, concept album and I enjoy it a lot. Listen to it all the times. Just Blaze murked \"Freedom\" and her vocals, in the parlance of those who slay, slayed. I\u2019ve given it multiple listens at this point so I could put some respeck on Beyonce\u2019s name and because before I go speaking about something, I like to have at least SOME idea of what I\u2019m talking about. Plus it\u2019s Yonce. Ain\u2019t no way I wasn\u2019t about to delve into it. Watching the film adds so many layers that aren\u2019t necessarily there when listening. I found myself skipping some tracks. For instance, \u201cSorry\u201d just doesn\u2019t play the same way without watching Serena Williams put some stank on it.\n\n5. Which gets to a point about the film, got damn! There was so much symbolism and so many easter eggs for which I'm not well enough versed to discuss. But scrolling through Facebook and seeing article upon article about this fact or that facet of the film lets me know that Beyonce had one mission with this film: whatever the next level is, Beyonce said, I want that level. She probably wrote the words \u201cchange the game\u201d on the white board before strategizing and if somebody had an idea that wasn\u2019t part of that mentality, they were fired.\n\n6. Speaking of Facebook, it is AMAZING how many articles were produced between 10pm Saturday night and noon Sunday. It\u2019s almost as if all of us who write (myself included, but I wanted to listen to the album several times first) immediately went into our thought-boxes to figure out how we were going to write about it. Be clear, I don\u2019t care how many articles already exist, I\u2019d wager that nearly every single person who writes about music and or culture will share their opinions, no matter how grand or small, somewhere. This again, is a gift and a curse. I saw a lot of people talking about who should or shouldn\u2019t and who can or can\u2019t write about Lemonade. And I think that\u2019s unfair. This site included. No shots fired at Dame because I get the point being made and we talked about it. No Becky with the good hair issues around here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut you don\u2019t put your product out \u2013 and let\u2019s be clear, no matter what the intent, it\u2019s art \u2013 for public consumption on motherfucking HBO intending for EVERYBODY and their mama to watch it and then believe that only a segment of the population has a true protective right to speak on it. It ain't like it ran on PBS after Sesame Street. I realize that it\u2019s probably not Beyonce\u2019s intent, but seeing so many people on Facebook expressing that effectively white people needed to sit this one out is pure bullshit. While some people \u2013 myself included \u2013 can\u2019t speak articulately about much of the symbolism in the visual, what I CAN do is use my eyes to look at what I see. I can tell you if something is stunning even if I don\u2019t know what it represents.\n\nI can tell you if music is great or sucks, even if I don\u2019t know the context behind certain lyrics. Until Sunday, I had no idea that Rachel Roy was an alleged sidepiece to Jay. Hell, I forgot she existed. I always thought that the thorn in their side was Rihanna. I do understand that everybody doesn\u2019t have the nuance to speak with authority on all pieces of art. But I also know that people like Beyonce create art to be consumed by all. I understand the need to protect our art. But I also think that Beyonce created this and pushed it to the masses because she wanted EVERYBODY to see where her artistic head space is. Some folks would get it. Others wouldn\u2019t. But sometimes the folks that don\u2019t need to get dragged across the coals and exposed as frauds who don\u2019t HAVE the context or wherewithal to get some in order to critique art in the event they refuse to learn. A lot of learning can happen from taking the time to write about what you saw.\n\n7. This is Beyonce\u2019s sixth studio album. She is now at the point where I think we\u2019re required to start ranking her albums. Here\u2019s my order: Beyonc\u00e9, 4, Lemonade, B\u2019Day, Dangerously In Love, and I Am\u2026Sasha Fierce, which was just awful, save for a few songs. I remember when 4 came out, I didn\u2019t think it was awesome. Revisiting that album has taught me (years ago) that I\u2019m an idiot. I was also wrong about Kanye West\u2019s Late Registration, Common\u2019s Be, and Teedra Moses\u2019 Complex Simplicity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. Let's talk about the Jay angle for a moment. I'm sure Jay heard this album a long time ago. I'm sure they had all the conversations about it while it was being created. I'm sure they've gone through and mended all of the fences. At least those that existed before Saturday. And I'm sure when Jay gets asked for the umpteenth time about it, he'll say, \"Beyonce is an artist and one of the greatest to have ever done it. I won't stop her from creating her art and I stand 100 percent behind her ability to do so.\" I also know that when Kanye dropped \"Big Brother\" on Graduation, Jay said that was Kanye's version of events and his truth, but shed some light on his side.\n\nMy boy and I were talking about this and he was like, if EVER Jay needed some motivation to drop a concept album, this is it. Point is, if Jay drops Lemons next month, I won't be surprised.\n\n9. I love everything Beyonce has done in the past 3+ years. From the moment she dropped \u201cBow Down/I Been On\u201d back in like March of 2013 she\u2019s been on this tear that has caused folks to say, \u201cwhat in the world is Bey doing?\u201d She\u2019s been on full art status and it\u2019s all been worth it. She\u2019s been putting her money where her mouth is and taking stands and showing her personality and giving us the best that she\u2019s got.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. One last thing, \u201cFormation\u201d doesn\u2019t fit this album. Oh, and Beyonc\u00e9 has the greatest team of all time when it comes to shutting the fuck up.\n\nKthxbi.", "keywords": ["art", "prince", "tidal", "point", "im", "lemonade", "jay", "beyonc\u00e9", "beyonce", "dont", "thoughts", "album"], "polarity": 0.1490280960869196, "subjectivity": 0.49970173254486966},

She and her infant daughter were forced to sleep in the airport to catch the first flight out the next morning after being booted from their flight.\n\n\n\nBriana Williams was on her way to visit family Aug. 21 when, she says, she was humiliated and forcibly removed from an American plane after she asked for her stroller during a five-hour delay due to weather.\n\n\n\nWilliams contacted the New York Daily News after seeing the story about activist Tamika Mallory, who was also kicked off an American Airlines flight on Sunday, as previously reported by The Root.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliams is a Harvard Law School student and she said she plans to sue.\n\n\n\nIn both cases, the women were removed by the plane\u2019s pilot, who seems to wield an inordinate amount of power to enact discriminatory practices against black women.\n\n\u201cThis type of unregulated discretion is a segue into discriminatory policy,\u201d said Williams.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliams also said that the pilot literally put her life in danger by labeling her a \u201cthreat.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe pilot put me in a potentially dangerous situation with law enforcement as a young black woman, saying that I was a \u2018threat,\u2019\u201d Williams said. \u201cThis type of rhetoric paralyzes the African-American community, and I want to ensure that policies are put in place that regulate the pilot\u2019s discretionary abilities.\u201d\n\n\n\nOnce American announced that her flight was delayed, Williams, who was carrying her baby and three bags, asked airline staff to return the stroller she had checked at the gate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAirline staff refused, and Williams said that she would not leave without her stroller.\n\n\n\nThe pilot was called.

Another of those pivotal albums, Dr. Dre\u2019s The Chronic, was released on Dec. 15, 1992, exactly 25 years ago today.\n\nI don\u2019t think I heard any of this album until somewhere in 1993. I was living in Germany at the time, and we got a lot of music and movies fairly late. But I had a friend who used to make me tapes because he had the stateside plug, and a few songs from that album were on one particular tape. On a trip to Italy for spring break, I remember stopping on base in Livorno and buying the tape from the PX. Life was never the same.\n\nTo me, EFIL4ZAGGIN was the album where Dr. Dre became \u201cDr. Dre the go-to West Coast producer extraordinaire.\u201d The music on that album was nothing short of beautifully produced from start to finish. It\u2019s also one of the most ignorant albums in all of existence. There are actual odes to statutory rape. And nonstatutory rape. And murder. It\u2019s super homophobic. It\u2019s almost as if they set out to make the most misogynistic album they could make and refused to stop until even they were impressed with their own nihilism.\n\nA 12- or 13-year-old me was entertained and didn\u2019t really care, but a 38-year-old me can\u2019t even listen to it. No matter how sonically wonderful it is, the actual content is easily one of the most indefensible bodies of work ever created. I don\u2019t know how any of them played that album for their mothers, and I\u2019m not even joking.\n\nThe Chronic, released a year and a half after EFIL4ZAGGIN, continued in that same tradition but with a brand-new cast of characters, including immediate standout Snoop Doggy Dogg. But RBX, Nate Dogg, Jewell, Kurupt, Dat Nigga Daz and the Lady of Rage all held their own. The beats were extra banging, and the sound, man, the sound was gold. Dr. Dre knew how to make a record and knew how to make that record sound timeless. Even now, listening to the actual CDs I purchased in the early \u201990s, the sound quality is as good as anything mixed and mastered nowadays. Musically, The Chronic is top-notch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut like a lot of albums coming out of Southern Cali during that time, the gangsta rap era, it\u2019s really hard to listen to it today. Back then, I was fully engrossed with West Coast gangsta rap. From Ice Cube to (especially) DJ Quik to Compton\u2019s Most Wanted to Lil Half Dead to Dogg Pound. If it was coming out of Los Angeles, I was typically all in.\n\nAnd almost all of the albums shared similar themes: house parties, weed, sex, violence, gangbanging, rape and rampant misogyny. It\u2019s actually impressive just how much rappers from Cali seemed to hate women. And yeah, I know, \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about women\u2014we\u2019re talking about bitches\u201d was the refrain from ignorant fools near and far, but it was really hard to distinguish from their lyrics who exactly was who.\n\nNow, compared to EFIL4ZAGGIN, The Chronic is almost tame. Almost. While the violence and misogyny are still cranked up to a 10\u2014the video for \u201cNuthin\u2019 but a \u2018G\u2019 Thang\u201d is particularly problematic\u2014the constant rape, murder and dismissal of women isn\u2019t AS present. Hell, there\u2019s even a pseudo-introspective song in the Donny Hathaway-sampling \u201cLil\u2019 Ghetto Boy.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s interesting. As I\u2019ve gotten older, I\u2019ve maintained a certain nostalgic appreciation for classic albums like The Chronic, but I find them very difficult to listen to. Don\u2019t get it twisted\u2014the album itself is every bit as good as it\u2019s always been. The songs are constructed well, the lyricism is great, the sequencing, the skits, everything. Plus, it gave us the \u201cdeez nuts\u201d gag that is as useful now as it was then.\n\nBut as I recently discovered, my ears are just different. I cringed at so many lines while listening to the album recently. My personal politics have adjusted toward less willful recklessness and more responsible thought processes, and that means that listening to 62 minutes of sex, murder and mayhem isn\u2019t as easy. And I\u2019d be lying if I said it was the gun or murder talk that bothered me; it\u2019s the misogyny. It\u2019s really hard to listen to albums that are built upon disrespect and violence toward women for no other reason than that they exist.\n\nWhen I was 13 and discovered The Chronic, it changed the way I listened to music, especially hip-hop. I was already a hip-hop fan, but it made me get into the actual art of creation. I was interested in the liner notes and the samples and who was involved in each record. I stopped being a consumer and started being an active engager. I started to really pay attention to labels and even engineers because any album this good, I needed to know everybody involved so I could go find other stuff from them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe trinity of EFIL4ZAGGIN, The Chronic and (Snoop\u2019s) Doggystyle is why Dr. Dre\u2019s name rings out so much among producers, and those albums turned me into a producer guy. It\u2019s why I love the wave of \u201970s instrumental jazz-fusion albums. The Chronic is a memorable mainstay part of my musical journey for that reason; sonically, we just hadn\u2019t heard anything like it.\n\nBut just like the album changed the way I listened to music, over time, the music changed the way I listened to albums, and some I had to put on the shelf and appreciate from afar. The Chronic will always be one of hip-hop\u2019s masterpieces and will always be one of my favorites. Always. But sometimes you take a look at them, remember what they meant and why, and move on because the art itself belongs in the era in which it was first consumed.\n\nThat\u2019s The Chronic.

The album, also titled Lemonade, was made available on Tidal (sigh) when the film concluded.\n\nNaturally, this film and the album dominated pop culture last night, and will continue to for the coming weeks. And people who write about these types of things for publications will be compelled to do so. Some of these people will be people who happen to be White. And, if you are a person who happens to be White, and you're compelled to write about Lemonade today or some time this week, here's a few tips on how you should go about doing it.\n\n1. Don't\n\nThis is the easiest strategy to employ. If you consumed Lemonade last night and you need to write a news piece about the release, or perhaps something about how it dominated Twitter, or maybe a review of the album itself, please go ahead! Be my guest!\n\nBut if you consumed Lemonade last night and you feel particularly compelled to offer an assessment or deconstruction of the appropriateness of the incorporation of Warsan Shire's words, or how Serena Williams' twerking signals the beginning of a new post-feminist meta anti-feminism, or why Jay Z seems preternaturally obsessed with Beyonce's ankles, or how it all connected to #BlackLivesMatter (please, please, please don't do this), or which messages Lemonade conveyed about Black fatherhood, or Quvenzhane Wallis's hair, take a step back from your keyboard, take a deep breath, say \"Nah,\" and go take a walk or something.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, your words and thoughts matter. #WhiteopinionsaboutLemonademattertoo. But at this specific moment, this is when you take your take and sit on and/or swallow it. Instead, use this opportunity to take a step back and consume the dozens of takes and pieces from smart and sharp Black writers and pundits and critics. If you say you can not find one, you are a lie. Because they are literally everywhere. I tripped over a Michael Arceneaux piece about it on my way to the bathroom this morning.\n\nAnd, if you believe you don't have a choice in the matter because you work at a publication and you were asked to offer your thoughts on what Lemonade means, guess what? You do have a choice! You can say no! And you could even use this opportunity to be a true White ally and recommend one of your Black colleagues for the assignment. And if you don't have any Black colleagues, this is when you say \"Hey, maybe we should reach out to Alex Hardy or Eve Ewing. They both had interesting thoughts on Twitter last night, and I'd love to see what they'd say in 1200 words.\" And if you don't know any cool and smart Black people like that, 1) REALLY? WHY THE FUCK DONT YOU? and 2) WHY THE FUCK DO YOU EVEN THINK IT'S OK FOR YOU TO WRITE ANYTHING ABOUT THIS IF YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW ANY COOL AND SMART BLACK PEOPLE?\n\nThis may seem unfair, racist even. But trust me. It is not. Ultimately, it is for your own protection. Because if you do dare offer a take on what any of it meant, and you get anything wrong \u2014 especially if it's wrong in a specifically tone-deaf, \"this White person just went full White person\" way \u2014 you will feel the wrath of tens of thousands of perturbed niggas with degrees raining fire, acid, Kendrick quotes, and chicken grease on your face, and it will not be pretty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Wait\n\nAfter a few days or perhaps a week has passed, and after you've read dozens of the smartest and sharpest assessments and deconstructions of Lemonade written by Black people, and you still wish to offer your own analysis, you can go ahead now. Because now, after you've consumed and learned from those pieces, you're (presumably) able to offer a more nuanced and thorough take. Perhaps you can even cite the specific pieces you read, using quotes to lean on when a point is articulated in a way you wouldn't have thought to.\n\nAnd don't worry about writer FOMO, because this is freakin Beyonce's Lemonade. Which means that, until Beyonce releases a part two \u2014 which'll probably be titled Simply Raspberry Creole Lemonade \u2014 Lemonade takes will continue to be relevant.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you happen to be a White person who writes things and you happen to be reading this, I'm flattered that you spent part of your Sunday reading this. Thank you! Now back the fuck away from your screen, close your laptop, go to brunch, take a walk with some friends, and spend the rest of the day watching the NBA playoffs and Game of Thrones.\n\nYou can even drink some actual lemonade!

Racism is still alive; they just be concealing it, after all. Or more likely, I\u2019m dazed by the fact that Alabama did the unthinkable, entirely thanks to black people, so I\u2019m feeling greedy. Yo no s\u00e9.\n\nBut the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame recently announced its 2018 inductees, a list that includes Nina Simone, Bon Jovi, the Cars, Dire Straits, Sister Rosetta Thorpe and the Moody Blues. A fine group of performers, some of whom you love and some of whom you probably hate. It\u2019s music and it\u2019s subjective. But their accomplishments are undeniable. In fact, inquiring why it took so long for all of those people to get in would be fair.\n\nAlso nominated but not selected for 2018? One James Todd Smith, better known to the world as LL Cool J. Including 2018, he\u2019s been on the ballot four times. How in the hell has he NOT gotten in?\n\nI realize that we don\u2019t care about Grammys or Oscars or Halls of Fame or any accolades, especially in hip-hop. Or so we say. According to Phife Dawg (RIP) on the song \u201cAward Tour\u201d from 1993\u2019s Midnight Marauders album, \u201cI\u2019ll never let a statue tell me how nice I am ... \u201d\n\nMeanwhile, in 2017, Q-Tip felt a way about being snubbed by the Grammys. So even if we as a community pretend we don\u2019t care, validation is validation and acknowledgment is acknowledgment, and we all like it\u2014especially for hip-hop, which has had to fight and claw its way into being respected by the mainstream gatekeepers DESPITE being the predominant musical form of the USA and, really, the world. I mean, everybody loves Tupac.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is not devoid of black artists. They ain\u2019t stupid. Artists from Sam Cooke to Gladys Knight & the Pips to Aretha Franklin to Bo Diddley to Jimmy Cliff to Bob Marley to the Jackson 5 to Michael Jackson all grace the annals of the Hall of Fame. And while I\u2019m sure there was a time when black artists struggled for that acknowledgment, we are all up and through there now.\n\nEXCEPT for the world of hip-hop, where, despite the genre\u2019s contributions to the WORLD, the only current inductees are Grandmaster Flash & the Furious Five, Run-DMC, Public Enemy, N.W.A and Tupac. A fine list of people who fit the criteria for the Hall of Fame\u2019s inductees: \u201cArtists\u2014a group encompassing performers, composers and/or musicians ... demonstrating unquestionable musical excellence and talent [who] have had a significant impact on the development, evolution and preservation of rock & roll.\u201d Obviously, the use of rock \u2019n\u2019 roll is the widest general definition, considering the various acts and individuals included therein.\n\nBut THEREIN lies my own confusion about the exclusion of LL Cool J. As a cultural icon and embodiment of everything the Hall of Fame exists to showcase, LL should have gone in when Run-DMC did, basically. As a solo act, especially. Every other act belongs there, but so does LL. While LL isn\u2019t the best at ANY particular realm of hip-hop, what he DOES have is the longevity tab on lock. We STILL know this man. He\u2019s still relevant\u2014maybe not as a musical artist, but for what you can do with your hip-hop celebrity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut even musically, he gave us Mama Said Knock You Out, Mr. Smith and Bigger and Deffer. He has seven No. 1 rap singles. Four top 10 U.S. singles in a time before hip-hop was entirely embraced by the country. He\u2019s got classic songs and, more important, is the REASON so many of those early rappers even decided to pick up microphones. He\u2019s been influential.\n\nIn hip-hop, he\u2019s one of the most well-known stalwarts of the most famed hip-hop label that\u2019s ever existed. He leveraged his hip-hop bona fides into commercials, movies and television. He took hip-hop to the boardrooms and got that corporate money there. He got FUBU into a Gap commercial.\n\nHow influential does an artist need to be to get that recognition, IF we\u2019re recognizing artists for those reasons? I have no idea if LL Cool J cares. I\u2019m sure he would like to be inducted, since it is a great honor and at this point of his career, musically, that\u2019s about all he has left to accomplish. Maybe it\u2019s not that big a deal to him, but since he\u2019s been nominated, NOT being inducted must be a little annoying, especially on this fourth go-round.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m sure that at some point he\u2019ll get in, as will artists like Jay-Z, Biggie, Puffy, Nas, DJ Kool Herc, DJ Premier and others, on sheer influence on hip-hop alone. I also think that Rakim belongs in there because he was YEARS ahead of his time and his influence cannot be measured even if he doesn\u2019t get universal credit for it. But it would be a shame for him not to get in soon, especially considering the other hip-hop acts that are in, as they\u2019re his contemporaries in the art form. Tupac is moving into the \u201990s. I can\u2019t see a world where LL doesn\u2019t make it, and I hope the Hall of Fame doesn\u2019t, either.", "keywords": ["rock", "roll", "im", "ll", "snubbing", "hiphop", "hes", "hall", "does", "j", "artists", "cool", "world", "fame"], "polarity": 0.1269675925925926, "subjectivity": 0.5079282407407406},

He claimed that those spots were given to the newly hired white and Latino employees instead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey started hiring all these people, and instead of putting them on day shifts, they was giving them night shifts and keeping us on day shift.

Every policy decision is cloaked\u2014and coded\u2014in the dismantling of everything that has helped give marginalized people even the smallest leg up in a society that is stacked against them in the first place.\n\nAttorney General Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III has been one of the most egregious and openly out members of the Trump administration when it comes to his plans to restore the white man\u2019s unadulterated power.\n\nEveryone Hates Jeff Sessions In this political climate, which seems to be grounded in separatism, it is rare when we can all\u2026 Read more Read\n\nIn his short time as head of the U.S. Department of Justice, he has reinstated an asset-forfeiture program, which unfairly targets minorities and poor people; he is trying to make \u201cfetch\u201d happen in the form of the purported \u201cwar on drugs\u201d; he wants to get rid of the consent decrees that hold police departments accountable for the way they treat everyday citizens; he is the biggest supporter of slavery in the form of mass incarceration; and he advocates for private prison companies to profit from that very same form of slavery.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNothing Sessions has done has been done in secret, and the latest move by the Justice Department may be the very thing that tips us over the edge from \u201cAre they doing what I think they are doing?\u201d to full-on \u201cHoly shit! They are doing exactly what we think they are doing.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday night, the New York Times broke the news that it was in possession of a Justice Department document outlining a plan to redirect the resources of the DOJ\u2019s Civil Rights Division toward investigations of and lawsuits against colleges and universities with affirmative action admissions policies that the department deemed discriminatory against white applicants.\n\nLet that sink in.\n\nFirst of all, keep in mind that if this were truly about real instances of white people being discriminated against in college admissions, the Justice Department has a division that handles issues related to schools and education issues; it\u2019s the Educational Opportunities Section, and it was put in place to enforce court decisions such as Brown v. Board of Education and federal legislation mandating that schools may neither segregate students by race nor discriminate against students based on sex, national origin, language barrier, religion or disabilities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo why not go through that department? I\u2019ll tell you why.\n\nMy theory is that the reason the Justice Department is going at this from the civil rights angle, and the reason it is attacking colleges and universities with affirmative action policies first, is that this is the low-hanging fruit that will lead to the ultimate victory: wiping out affirmative action in all aspects of American life, including employment.\n\nIf the people at the Justice Department are able to get a court victory that sustains their belief that affirmative action policies are prejudicial against white people, that opens the door for employers to say, \u201cHey, then why do we have to have affirmative action?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou know what that also does?\n\nIt opens the door for open discrimination in housing.\n\nIt is the opening to dismantle the Civil Rights Act from a long-con approach.\n\nBecause let\u2019s be clear: This idea of removing these protections is not anything new. These ideas have been in the heads of white people in power for a long time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Times cites Roger Clegg, a former top official in the Civil Rights Division under President Ronald Reagan, as an open supporter of this latest move.\n\nClegg is quoted as saying, \u201cThe civil rights laws were deliberately written to protect everyone from discrimination, and it is frequently the case that not only are whites discriminated against now, but frequently Asian Americans are as well.\u201d\n\nIn case you aren\u2019t aware, Clegg is president of the Center for Equal Opportunity, a misnomer for an organization that is hell-bent on fighting affirmative action, immigrant-friendly immigration policies and the Voting Rights Act, among other things.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI will not provide a link to the center\u2019s hateful website. You are free to Google the organization\u2019s name and take a look for yourself, but let me provide you with a snippet from its \u201cmission statement\u201d:\n\nWe work to promote a colorblind society, one within which race and skin color are no longer an issue and so accordingly we oppose admission, hiring, and contracting policies that discriminate, sort, or prefer on the basis of race or ethnicity. We oppose racial gerrymandering. We oppose bilingual education, because it segregates students by national origin, encourages identity politics, and fails to teach children English\u2014the single most important skill they can learn and the most important social glue holding our country together. And, whatever one believes to be an acceptable level of immigration, all should agree that those coming to America must become Americans, and this means that assimilation is not a dirty word, but a national necessity.\n\nRead it twice so you get where I\u2019m going with this.\n\nAgain, none of this is being done in secret. The Department of Education, under the monster that is Betsy DeVos, has already said that it plans to scale back on investigations of civil rights violations at the nation\u2019s public schools and universities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom the Times:\n\nAccording to an internal memo issued by Candice E. Jackson, the acting head of the department\u2019s office for civil rights, requirements that investigators broaden their inquiries to identify systemic issues and whole classes of victims will be scaled back. Also, regional offices will no longer be required to alert department officials in Washington of all highly sensitive complaints on issues such as the disproportionate disciplining of minority students and the mishandling of sexual assaults on college campuses.\n\nAre you paying attention? Are you seeing what they are doing here?\n\nThey are creating a fast track to the return of Jim Crow. They won\u2019t call it Jim Crow; they consider it making American \u201cgreat\u201d again, but as I said before, it is Jim Crow in a red hat and a bloated white body, wielding its power over marginalized communities no matter how you look at it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTake away access to education. Remove restrictions that prevent discrimination in hiring and housing. Crack down on small-time drug dealers and people in poor communities in every way you can.\n\nCreate a system in which there is no way for people to break out of the systems of poverty that hold them down.\n\nTake away health care. Cut down on social programs that help the poor.\n\nMake it OK for an already militarized police force to create a police state in which we have no defense against their aggressions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nContinue to open private prisons. Funnel the oppressed and those committing small crimes into that system. Create a new system of chattel slavery that profits off of white supremacy.\n\nCall it justice, because it has all been enabled by the \u201cJustice\u201d Department.\n\nSit back and watch their master, or your master\u2019s, plan at work.\n\nBe afraid.

These instances are typically about female students (because let\u2019s face it, dress codes are pretty much only about women\u2019s fashion and beauty), and more often than not about students of color.\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, we learned of black teen twins in Massachusetts who were banned from prom and extracurricular clubs for wearing braided hair extensions. A popular protective style for naturals, the braids were said to be against the school\u2019s rules against hair extensions, distracting hairstyles and hair higher than 2 inches.\n\n\n\nKnowing what we know about black hair growth\u2014that tightly coiled or kinky hair grows up and out instead of down, and that the use of extensions like box braids allows for healthy hair growth\u2014this rule sounded extremely targeted toward students of color, specifically black students. The school has since suspended all punishments and promised to rework the policies, but the larger concern is cultural education and addressing the biases that breed school policies targeting black students.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAuthor Obiagele Lake discusses the connection between black codes from the Reconstruction era and the mandated appearance codes that we see in the present day in her 2003 book, Blue Veins and Kinky Hair: Naming and Color Consciousness in African America. After the Civil War, Southern states passed black codes as a means of limiting newly freed African Americans and pushing free blacks to continue to work in labor-intensive industries.\n\n\n\nThe book touches on the internalized negative images carried through black generations created from involuntary lives in a white supremacist culture. Some of these codes were so specific that they targeted the types of patterns and clothes that black people were able to wear, citing them as an effort to help newly freed blacks \u201cfit in\u201d with their new environment. All the while, the codes continued to limit the freedom of identity and cultural expression that had been stifled through enslavement.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe hear similar reasoning behind school dress code policies, that they are an effort to decrease obvious income disparities or differences that might distract others in a learning environment\u2014giving students a visual level playing field and contributing to school unity. But a 2014 study conducted by the National Women\u2019s Law Center (pdf) and NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund reported that black girls are fives times more likely to be suspended from school than their white female counterparts (only 17 percent of the school population, black girls make up 43 percent of those receiving disciplinary action). When we look at the targets of dress codes and bias toward mandating the appearance of girls, these numbers aren\u2019t surprising at all.\n\n\n\nSystematic discrimination is a major problem. But what about the long-term effects on our children? I spoke with Adrianne Pettiford, a published research psychologist who studies discrimination in schools as well as racial-identity development, particularly among black youths. When asked about the effects of being discriminated against or \u201cpicked on\u201d based on racial characteristics like hair or skin color, Pettiford explained that bullying of any nature may have many effects (e.g., anxiety, physical aggression, academic disengagement, low self-esteem, etc.). Yet \u201c[w]hen bullying is racially motivated, there are additional potential consequences\u2014the child may internalize the messages of their bullies and come to feel that being black is a negative characteristic,\u201d she said.\n\nPettiford noted that while she does not specifically study the connection between dress code violations and racial identity, she is definitely aware of the disparity in punishment of black children compared with their white counterparts. She commented that \u201cthis disparity fuels the academic disengagement of black female students and contributes to their contact with the juvenile justice system and subsequent adult offending. The school-to-prison pipeline often is discussed when speaking of black male youths, but it is also a reality for our girls.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI asked Pettiford what advice she would give to parents wanting to advocate and address their children\u2019s feelings, since we have some understanding of how our children may be affected by punishment connected to their appearance. She suggested that \u201cparents be intentional about ensuring social media and popular media are not the only sources of racial messages their child receives.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith regard to racial socialization [the practice of teaching children about the meaning and personal implications of race], a combination of conveying both the positive aspects of being black and how to handle instances in which they encounter racial bias seems to work best,\u201d she said. \u201cFor example, a parent might discuss with their teenager how to respond when told their natural hair is problematic before such an issue ever occurs, and help plan appropriate responses.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn popular culture, black natural hair is \u201con trend.\u201d Mainstream media has picked up on the perceived coolness of some types of black hair, and we see an increase in representation. However, for many black women, our hair has been anything but cool for the majority of our lives. Regardless of the celebration we may see now, there is a lifetime of hate and pain wrapped around our natural hair texture and the way we have been treated because of it.\n\n\n\nTo be told that your natural self (a \u201cself\u201d that many of us have spent the majority of our lives learning to love and accept) is a fad, is extreme or is exaggerated can be dehumanizing. Where is the code banning blond hair? We would be up in arms at someone\u2019s personal preference of acceptable beauty being made into a hard-and-fast rule for all women to follow.\n\nThis is what is being asked of black girls and women\u2014to take a cultural standard as rule and change ourselves to fit in. The Transportation Security Administration still pats down my hair every single time I travel\u2014all while I am watching white women with buns and updos walk through untouched. We are tired of being prohibited, especially while being told that it is to help us fit in or to avoid distracting others.

From the piano riff that runs through the entire song, which is nothing short of heaven-sent in its perfection, to the buildup at the end to punctuate the emotions and the stories of the four women who are the essence of the song, \u201cFour Women\u201d brilliantly shares the various pain and struggles of black womanhood in America, as faced by these four black figures: Aunt Sarah, Saffronia, Sweet Thing and Peaches.\n\nAccording to an old Village Voice piece written by Thulani Davis after Simone passed away in 2003:\n\n\n\nBut it was \u201cFour Women,\u201d an instantly accessible analysis of the damning legacy of slavery, that made iconographic the real women we knew and would become. For African American women it became an anthem affirming our existence, our sanity, and our struggle to survive a culture which regards us as anti-feminine. It acknowledged the loss of childhoods among African American women, our invisibility, exploitation, defiance, and even subtly reminded that in slavery and patriarchy, your name is what they call you.\n\nAs a youth, I\u2019d heard Simone\u2019s music through my own discovery of new artists, but it (admittedly) wasn\u2019t until Kanye West sampled \u201cSinnerman\u201d for Talib Kweli\u2019s \u201cGet By\u201d in 2002 that I did a deep dive into her entire catalog. I spent a week digging into internet crates looking for every album I could find, trying to learn as much as I could.\n\nHer political messaging stood out to me particularly because of the timing and tone of a lot of her music\u2014so much was released in the heat of the civil rights movement\u2014and she didn\u2019t make any bones about her feelings over what was happening in America.\n\nFrom the Washington Post about the creation of the song \u201cMississippi Goddam\u201d:\n\nWhen Nina Simone heard about the bombing death of four young girls at the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Ala., in 1963, she famously went to her garage and tried to build a zip gun to take out her anger on someone. When her husband suggested that her music would be a more effective weapon, she wrote \u201cMississippi Goddam,\u201d a politically charged song that declared, \u201cLord have mercy on this land of mine / we all gonna get it in due time.\u201d When she released the song in 1964, it contained this curious, spoken aside: \u201cThis is a show tune, but the show hasn\u2019t been written for it yet.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFour Women\u201d follows along in that political ideology, and from the moment I first heard it, I was drawn into it. It\u2019s almost impossible not to feel something. She electrified us with her storytelling, and influenced other artists\u2014there are plays and works named in honor of the song\u2014by creating offerings that spoke to black womanhood in ways that resonated broadly, but particularly among black women.\n\nHer catalog contains so many gems that one listen through any greatest-hits compilation would whet your appetite for more. From \u201cPlease Don\u2019t Let Me Be Misunderstood\u201d to the aforementioned \u201cSinnerman\u201d and \u201cMississippi Goddam\u201d to \u201cI Put a Spell on You,\u201d you can find almost anything you\u2019re looking for from Nina Simone. She has over 30 albums for your choosing, but even among the many gems, \u201cFour Women\u201d stands out for its impact and purpose.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s why they call her Peaches, the last of the four women:", "keywords": ["introduced", "mississippi", "perfect", "history", "simones", "black", "song", "women", "simone", "moments", "nina", "heard", "music", "released"], "polarity": 0.11215200029855203, "subjectivity": 0.4679047245857591},

You know I rock with you. You\u2019re my man 100 grand. But why are you devoting an entire explainer to the difference between two words I can just go and find in the dictionary?\n\nThank you for the kind words! I should tell you, though, that this explainer is actually about the colloquial use of \u201chungry\u201d and \u201cthirsty,\u201d not the standard definitions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAh, I see. I never should have doubted you. Just like I never should have eaten that microwaved sashimi for lunch today.\n\nShit. I need to hurry with this explainer, then, because you\u2019re gonna die soon.\n\n\n\nAnyway, in a colloquial sense, \u201cthirsty\u201d and \u201chungry\u201d both mean the same thing. Each term is a way of articulating a person\u2019s ambition. Where they differ is in connotation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow so?\n\n\u201cHungry\u201d describes an ambition that\u2019s rooted in integrity. It implies hard work, diligence and dedication. You\u2019d advise any person attempting to achieve a goal to be hungry. \u201cThirsty,\u201d however, implies desperation. A blind ambition where your goals are suspect and you\u2019re more than willing to make questionable decisions to achieve them.\n\nI see. Can you provide an example?\n\nOf course! Let\u2019s say a high school sophomore wishes to be the starting point guard on the school\u2019s basketball team next year. If he\u2019s hungry, he\u2019s going to spend the entire summer refining his game, lifting weights and getting in better shape. If he\u2019s thirsty, however, he\u2019ll start a rumor that the kid he\u2019s competing with for that starting spot has herpes. And not just herpes herpes, but a rare herpes that can only be contracted through basketball contact.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThirsty niggas invent diseases?\n\nAnd spread unsubstantiated rumors. Shit, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the bubonic plague was caused by a crew of really thirsty sewer rats pissed that the house rats were getting all the cheese.\n\nIs thirst just based on ambition-based actions?\n\nNo. Thirst levels can also be based on why you have a particular ambition. Using the high school basketball player again, if he\u2019s hungry, he wants that starting spot to prove that he deserves it and to be able to compete on the highest levels. Perhaps he even wants to earn a basketball scholarship. If he\u2019s thirsty, he just wants to be a starter to increase his pool for potential prom dates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs it possible to be hungry and thirsty at the same time?\n\nDefinitely! For instance, no one would deny that Drake has an impeccable work ethic. Especially back when he was releasing new mixtapes every few months. He was hungry to establish himself as, well, who he is today. But his actual content, while good (mostly), has always been thirsty.\n\nI mean, how many songs can one person write about \u201cAmber\u201d from \u201cSilver Spring\u201d who \u201cworked at Cheesecake Factory\u201d and \u201chooked you up with extra jalape\u00f1o poppers\u201d and how you always wished you could \u201cescape the world together\u201d but you\u2019re \u201ctoo infatuated with Houston strippers\u201d but still wish, sometimes, that you were \u201cnormal\u201d so you could have your \u201cCheesecake Factory romance\u201d in peace?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDrake is so thirsty, I\u2019m shocked his tonsils aren\u2019t sandpaper. Someone get that nigga an Aquafina!\n\nAnyone else hungry and thirsty at the same time?\n\nMiley Cyrus, whose career seems to be a perpetual vacillation between extreme hunger and extreme thirst. Taylor Swift was hungry once and now needs intravenous fluids. America, for all its faults, was hungry as fuck for a few hundred years. But now this entire country needs some Kool-Aid.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOh, and Jay-Z.\n\nJay-Z?\n\nYeah. As interesting and laudable as 4:44 was, you have to admit that was a thirsty-adjacent album. Like, it wasn\u2019t quite parched, but it probably should have hydrated a bit more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI see. Well, how are the distinctions between hunger and thirst applied to our daily lives?\n\nThe internet, for instance, is a virtual petri dish for unregulated thirst. Like, you know how many cities have created bike lanes on roads, making it easier for people with bikes to travel? Well, the internet is a bike lane for thirsty niggas. Unsolicited DM sliding, unabashed desperation for likes and retweets, performative contrarianism\u2014these are all products of excessive thirst. One day, someone needs to dump the entire internet into a baptismal pool.\n\nThat would need to be a big-ass pool.\n\nI guess the ocean would do. But then we\u2019d have to deal with all of that salt.

This means that whenever we go ANYWHERE, I have to have a few things on deck: diapers, wipes, a first-aid kit of some sort, snacks, and water or juice. You can get away with water for a while, but once your little ones taste that sweet nectar of concentrate, all you\u2019ll hear from then on is, \u201cI WAN\u2019 JUICE!\u201d Parenting, man. It\u2019s the business.\n\n\n\nNow, I have a fairly boss diaper bag that has all the pockets and several compartments in odd places that aren\u2019t handy until they\u2019re super handy. Mommy, though? Mommy throws stuff in her purse. It\u2019s why she gets very nice but big-as-hell tote purses. They can fit everything! I\u2019m talking snack cups, diapers, juice boxes, changes of clothes, etc.\n\nMy parents can feel me on this one.

I shall eat them myself.\n\nSo it was no surprise but also a little bit awesome to see Blue Ivy munching on what looks to be fruit snacks while mom Yonc\u00e9 held on to the juice box and an extra fruit-snack pouch, just in case. Listen\u2014for those of you who are not parents yet, let me explain something to you about children under the age of, say, 8 who want shit:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey don\u2019t give a fuck about where they are or who you are or why you\u2019re there. When they want something, they want it, and they are going to let you know loudly and frequently.\n\nSome kids? They learn early on about \u201ctime and place.\u201d Other kids know that lesson, but ain\u2019t nothing worse than being hungry and bored. It\u2019s the same thing as being hangry, except when you\u2019re 6, being bored is the ultimate in, \u201cWHY IS THIS MY LIFE?!\u201d For whatever reason, snacks and juice typically shut kids up for a while as they happily munch away on whatever it is you decided to bring, from pita chips to Cheerios, temporarily satisfied with life.\n\nI imagine for a show as long as the Grammys were\u2014and good Lord, were they long\u2014that Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s bag was full of an assortment of amazing snack treats. And juice boxes. I\u2019d also bet money that while Blue Ivy has clearly done this before, they have conversations about whether or not to bring her along. My guess is that because her daddy was up for several awards, she got to go.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile clearly the lives of folks like Jay and Beyonc\u00e9 are far beyond most of us, it\u2019s those moments that let you know that though fame and fortune may separate us, they deal with a lot of same shit we all do on a daily basis. Relationships have the same ups and downs and worries about money (at varying degrees, of course), and the joys of parenting\u2014the simplest parts\u2014are the same for us all.\n\nI don\u2019t know for sure, but I\u2019ll bet Jay and Bey change diapers for their twins, and I imagine they\u2019ve had to deal with the hilarity of a kid peeing after you remove the diaper, OR the kid taking a diaper off and running down the hall as you chase them in an attempt to get to them before they squat.\n\nOr having to wake up at the ass crack of dawn because your child has decided that it\u2019s 6 a.m. and they are ready to \u201ceat eat\u201d even though Jesus himself is like, \u201cNaw bro. I need 3o more minutes.\u201d Kids don\u2019t care about celebrity; they care about themselves in the sometimes cutest ways possible.

With tears in his eyes, Lamar rapped a mile a minute to songs like \u201cXXX,\u201d \u201cDNA\u201d and \u201cKing\u2019s Dead,\u201d marching alongside the soldiers and introducing us to his satire. The screens behind him read, \u201cThis is a satire by Kendrick Lamar.\u201d Men in red hoodies fell to the ground every time Lamar extended his arm to shoot them.\n\n\n\nAs if that wasn\u2019t entertaining enough, Lamar brought out U2\u2019s Bono and the Edge and Dave Chappelle! Chappelle reminded the audience, \u201cThe only thing more frightening than watching a black man be honest in America is being a an honest black man in America.\u201d Message! Then out came a black female drummer, not only giving you African realness, but sis danced, too! Lamar better give us Motherland! \u201cIs this on cable?\u201d Chappelle asked, because Lamar was out here giving the world the realness.\n\n\n\nBy the time Lamar went onstage, he was already the winner of three Grammys. He won for best rap performance, best rap album and best music video for \u201cHumble.\u201d He and Rihanna also won best rap/sung performance for \u201cLoyalty.\u201d I\u2019m like congrats to Lamar and all, but Rihanna in that monochromatic vinyl moment was worth fawning over.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOh, and I couldn\u2019t get enough of Rihanna busting out the South African dance the gwara gwara!\n\n\n\nThe All-Black Church Choir During Sam Smith\u2019s Performance\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSam Smith was accompanied by a black church choir that stood behind him giving nothing but strong black women who were all fresh out the salon. Sam sang down on his single \u201cPray\u201d as the choir served us Baptist church.\n\nChuck Berry and Fats Domino Tribute\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJon Batiste and Gary Clark Jr. laced the stage with more rock \u2019n\u2019 roll than the Grammys deserved with their Chuck Berry and Fats Domino tribute. Late Show bandleader Batiste\u2019s laid-back style was a perfect complement to Clark\u2019s funky style. From Domino\u2019s \u201cAin\u2019t That a Shame\u201d to Berry\u2019s \u201cMaybelline,\u201d the performance reminded us all of Berry\u2019s and Domino\u2019s undeniable contributions to music.\n\n\n\nBlue Ivy Shushing Mommy and Daddy\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYeah, these front-row seats to the Grammys are great and all, but chill, Mom and Dad, you\u2019re embarrassing me.\u201d We all go through that phase where our parents are less superhero and more super annoying. I wonder what that\u2019s going to look like for Blue Ivy because she clearly runs the entire compound of the Knowles-Carters.\n\n\n\nChildish Gambino Performance\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI felt like I was in the middle of a \u201990s sex scene in a classic black movie. Donald Glover sang \u201cTerrified\u201d and the vibes of the entire show changed. There are moments during many shows when singers bring out their backup singers to riff together. One of the most iconic was when Mariah Carey brought out Trey Lorenz during a performance of \u201cI\u2019ll Be There,\u201d and going forward, everyone wanted to hear that version of the song. Glover brought out child actor J.D. McCrary (who is featured on the song), and he is easily a vocal genius.\n\n\n\nGlover was quietly impressive. He\u2019s well on his way to EGOT territory, as he\u2019s already holding two Emmys and a Grammy. An Oscar and a Tony aren\u2019t far-fetched.\n\n\n\nDave Chappelle Shades Whole Show Over Tribe Called Quest Snub\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDave Chappelle was asked to present the award for the best rap album, and he did so, in a very Chappelle way. He gave several shoutouts, including one to A Tribe Called Quest, calling them all out by name, then making a reference to the group\u2019s 2016 album, We Got It from Here ... Thank You 4 Your Service.\n\n\u201cI have so much love and respect to all the nominees tonight,\u201d Chappelle began, \u201cand I just want to take a moment to honor Jarobi, Ali Shaheed Muhammad, Q-Tip, sometimes Busta, sometimes Consequence and, of course, always and forever Phife Dawg. Can we kick it?\u201d\n\nAnd then Kendrick Lamar won the Grammy, giving him his fifth win for the night! \u201cGod up top all the time,\u201d Lamar said. \u201cI thought it was about the accolades, the cars and clothes, but it\u2019s really about expressing yourself and putting that paint on the canvas for the world to evolve for the next generation and the next.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUgh, Kendrick Lamar for president!\n\n(Sidenote: When Dave Chappelle won the Grammy for best comedy album, mostly what he had to say in his acceptance speech was, \u201cSee you Monday.\u201d)\n\n\n\nCardi B and Bruno Mars Drippin\u2019 in \u2018Finesse\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s hard to watch Cardi B without being excited thinking of her meteoric rise and smiling. I\u2019m just so proud of her, out here getting nominated and performing at her first Grammys! Being nominated up against Jay-Z and Kendrick Lamar is crazy and, yes, \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d still slaps.\n\nIt was great seeing Grammy god Bruno Mars and Cardi kill their In Living Color tribute of a performance on the Grammys stage. Bruno\u2019s dance break hyped the crowd up with the best \u201990s moves you\u2019ve seen since House Party.\n\nShaggy Kept Coming Out With Sting\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSting wants us to know that he\u2019s all about the islands with his new collaboration with Shaggy. From their subway skit (that went on way too long) with the show\u2019s host, James Corden, to their performance, I felt force-fed, but I am honestly curious about this odd couple.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s evidently a joint album coming, and they sang \u201cDon\u2019t Make Me Wait,\u201d which actually does slap. I\u2019m low-key excited for this unlikely pairing. I might be lying.\n\n\n\nShemar Moore and Eve Introducing SZA\u2019s Performance\n\nWhat\u2019s black as hell?

And SZA went off!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd my feelings are a little bit hurt that SZA was the most nominated woman at the Grammys this year and left with nothing. I\u2019m glad she didn\u2019t win for best new artist. We all know that curse.\n\n\n\nFire and Fury Spoken-Word Auditions\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of host James Corden\u2019s skits consisted of various celebrities with not-so-positive opinions on your president sitting down to do dramatic readings of the book Fire and Fury. The lineup was perfect: John Legend, Snoop Dogg, Cher, Cardi B and Hillary Clinton. The skit was glorious.\n\nAnd an honorable mention goes to Cardi B\u2019s red-carpet moment with E! host Giuliana Rancic. When she asked Cardi how she was feeling, Cardi cardi-ed and said: \u201cI\u2019m feeling good. I\u2019m feeling nervous, overwhelmed, everything. Butterflies in my stomach and vagina.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was clear Rancic couldn\u2019t remember the Cardi B lyrics she desperately wanted to summon; nor could she handle Cardi (or Lil Uzi Vert, for that matter), but Cardi handled her own and made for another hilarious, viral moment.\n\n\n\nDid you watch the 2018 Grammys?

Henson. Seriously, the woman so regularly kills it on the red carpet, we\u2019re ready to nickname her Buffy the Couture Slayer. At last night\u2019s Academy Awards, she certainly lived up to the moniker, putting her own slightly gothic spin on the goddess-inspired trend that threatened to take over the red carpet.\n\nWearing a sleek bob styled by Tymothe Wallace and a Vera Wang couture gown chosen by stylist Jason Bolden (who also dressed Ava DuVernay this Oscar weekend), the actress showed off her famously toned body with yards of chiffon, sheer paneling and an up-to-there slit, flashing us a gleaming length of leg throughout the evening\u2019s festivities.\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images)\n\nAnd because we never tire of an epic slay here at The Glow Up, when we heard that Henson\u2019s longtime makeup artist Ashunta Sheriff was dishing on the star\u2019s look last night, we naturally wanted the goods. I mean ... who wouldn\u2019t?\n\nFun fact: As both a model and, later, a first-time Grammy nominee, I was blessed to have my face polished to perfection by Ashunta Sheriff. I can personally attest that she is a master of her craft, and a makeup maven who makes contouring a breeze with the first-ever dual-ended foundation stick from her collection, Ashunta Sheriff Beauty. She\u2019s also generous enough to share her expertise: Time spent in her chair is as educational as it is beautifying!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images)\n\nOn that note, here\u2019s our favorite secret to how Sheriff created Henson\u2019s Oscar slay: Several components can be found right in your local drusgtore aisle. For instance, like Issa Rae\u2019s Golden Globes makeup artist, Joanna Simkin, Sheriff looked no further than a reliable household name to make sure Henson\u2019s skin took center stage last night. As she shared with The Glow Up:\n\n1. \u201cBecause Taraji\u2019s dress was Grecian and flowy and showed lots of skin, I wanted to make sure she was glowing and moisturized from head to toe! I used Vaseline Intensive Care Cocoa Radiant Lotion, made with deep healing moisturizers and Vaseline jelly; it was the perfect choice to show off her healthy, luminous skin.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. \u201cTo start off her makeup, I used Fenty Beauty by Rihanna Pro Filt\u2019r Instant Retouch Primer. Then Perfect Blend by Ashunta Sheriff, a dual-ended foundation and concealer that helps you get even in one step. Perfect Blend is the first dual-ended foundation and helps to tone down redness. The formula feels lightweight and wears like a second skin, giving you medium to buildable coverage. I used the shade medium for a natural soft coverage.\n\n\n\n3. \u201cFor Taraji\u2019s already amazing cheekbones, I used my fingertips for a softening effect to highlight, using Danessa Myricks Enlight Illuminator powder in Confidence. Its super-pigmented shimmer is my favorite. I contoured using Cozette S145 Perfect Contour brush and Cozette Infinite Contour Palette to sculpt cheekbones.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. \u201cFor the eyes, I used Kiss Beauty Blowout Lashes in Pixie. These lashes are perfect for sexy and soft looks; plus, Kiss makes affordable lashes that are comparable to high-end brands. I placed lashes close to Taraji\u2019s lash line, then created a thin line using Kiss Waterproof Wonders precision-point eye liner to create definition. I always marry faux lashes and real lashes with Kiss Mascara in Black.\n\n\n\n5. \u201cLastly, I finished the look off with lip liner in MAC Cork and filled in her lips as well, for longevity\u2014layering ensures the color lasts longer. To finish the lip, I applied the Lip Bar Liquid Matte Creme in Savage and Drama Queen.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAshunta Sheriff and Taraji P. Henson are clearly a match made in makeup heaven\u2014after all, what better color to use on Henson than \u201cDrama Queen\u201d? Henson certainly brought the drama last night, and with a slay game this consistent, we\u2019re not sure which we\u2019re more excited about: the Oscar-nominated actress\u2019s next film, or her next appearance on the red carpet!", "keywords": ["oscars", "slays", "using", "red", "henson", "kiss", "carpetagain", "taraji", "ashunta", "sheriff", "makeup", "tarajis", "perfect", "p", "glow", "lashes", "used"], "polarity": 0.1809403559403559, "subjectivity": 0.46866489991489985},

But men and women had very different reactions, to put it lightly.\n\nMany women applauded Jay\u2019s ability to finally take up the mantle of manhood and apologize for his bad behavior; for black women especially, there seemed to be a collective \u201cThank you!\u201d He had violated the trust of Queen Bey, and that was unacceptable. In the aftermath of the release, Candice Benbow\u2019s \u201c4:43\u201d spoke to nearly every black woman I know about what it means for men to finally reckon with honesty and faithfulness\u2014or not to\u2014at the expense of the women they claim to love.\n\nHowever, men weren\u2019t collectively as gracious, and although a 4:44 syllabus created by Anthony Boynton addressed issues of toxic masculinity and manhood, the reception from some men seemed to decry Jay as a \u201csellout\u201d to women. How dare he apologize? Maybe Bey wasn\u2019t doing her \u201cjob.\u201d [Editor\u2019s note: GTFOH.]\n\nWith the appearance of writer and transgender activist Janet Mock as one of the \u201cfounding mothers\u201d in the \u201cFamily Feud\u201d video, I couldn\u2019t help wondering: What are these same men thinking about Jay now?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019ll confess that though I\u2019m a longtime fan of Jay-Z, I\u2019m not a fan of \u201cFamily Feud.\u201d Though Jay rarely has a misstep lyrically, the line \u201cLet me alone, Becky\u201d seems to completely place the blame for his affair or affairs on the infamous \u201cBecky with the good hair\u201d rather than where it squarely needs to be: at Jay-Z\u2019s billionaire feet. In my opinion, it undermines the title track (\u201c4:44\u201d), where he actually apologizes and keeps the attention solely on his fuckboy behavior. So suffice it to say that when the video for \u201cFamily Feud\u201d debuted on Dec. 29, I wasn\u2019t too interested in checking it out.\n\nBut then I thought, \u201cIt\u2019s Jay. I got to.\u201d And I\u2019m happy that I did.\n\nTo start off, the choice to open the video with a quote by James Baldwin\u2014a queer black man\u2014is subversive in its own way. But then, when we time-travel to 2050 and the council of founding mothers, among the many famous faces, we see Janet Mock.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s an interesting vibe when you watch a video intended to reveal a futuristic narrative about families feuding; I read the table of founding mothers as a collective of multihued women \u201csaving\u201d us from ourselves\u2014yet again. Some have expressed concern about the fact that there\u2019s no truly ebony woman at the table, which is an important conversation about colorism that needs to be addressed. And yet seeing Mock at the table as a fully participating part of the healing process made my masculine-of-center lesbian heart leap for joy!\n\nAs I replayed that section of the video, I wondered if Mock\u2019s inclusion was a result of Ava DuVernay\u2019s hand in the process, or was Jay giving a nod to us queer women\u2014cis and trans alike\u2014that yes, I see your womanhood? Hard to tell, but I\u2019ll take that win. Of course, that also means acknowledging the possibility of tokenism, which I\u2019m never in favor of.\n\nIn fact, one could argue that the entire video has moments that give us a wobbly understanding of futurism\u2014possibly Afro but certainly black American: a distinction that is important in the analysis of why it feels very American. For instance, the question of tokenism could also be raised when examining the inclusion of Native American actress Irene Bedard as one of the presidents in this futuristic world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I\u2019d beg to differ; for me, her appearance alongside Omari Hardwick was a reminder of the much-needed conversation that black Americans and Native Americans\u2014both of whom have been uniquely affected by colonization in the social project that is America\u2014need to have. It is important that they are sitting side by side, defending each other and having each other\u2019s backs.\n\nWith that in mind, I\u2019m going to optimistically err on the side of DuVernay\u2019s deft hand and say that tokenism isn\u2019t a part of Mock\u2019s inclusion. She belongs there because she is a woman. I hope Mock\u2019s presence among the founding mothers in this video signifies a shift away from the misogynoir and queer antagonism still present in contemporary hip-hop narratives. Maybe young men will take a note from an elder statesman and begin to understand their regressive ideologies.\n\nBut I can hardly see someone like black activists\u2019 fave Kendrick Lamar doing any work in this area. He can barely speak about cis black women in a positive manner, so I\u2019d be doubly surprised if he attempted to take on embracing queer and trans black women. I wondered as I watched this video\u2014do you have to get to almost 50 years old and out of the price range of Target runs to get some damn sense when it comes to love and womanhood?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI find it telling that embracing queer women on an album where you are finally understanding that black women aren\u2019t the cocoons in which black men find their humanity feels like the next step in an evolution toward manhood. And when it comes to toxic masculinity and its relationship to womanhood, I\u2019m interested to see if Jay will, at some point, walk us through his understanding of the humanity of queer men as well.\n\nBut the presence of Janet Mock gives me hope. Not hope of acceptance\u2014that would just be empty rhetoric and truly a pitch to tokenism of the basest form. No, I hope that her presence is an acknowledgment of the personhood of queer folks. The ongoing murders of trans women\u2014particularly those of color\u2014speak to a deep and entrenched toxic combination of internalized racism and unhealthy masculinity that continues to inhabit our communities.\n\nIt\u2019s finally time for people to recognize that the most marginalized voices in the room\u2014those of trans women of color\u2014should be centered in our conversations when we are talking about getting free. Maybe our human family can stop the feuding over gender-identity labels and start thinking more broadly about what it means to be a man or a woman or genderqueer. That said, I\u2019m not going to label this video as a catalyst for that freedom.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I am going to call it a start.", "keywords": ["queer", "jayzs", "belongs", "tokenism", "im", "seat", "jay", "makes", "major", "finally", "trans", "video", "women", "feud", "family", "table", "black", "woman", "men", "statement"], "polarity": 0.13311459667093473, "subjectivity": 0.527593896713615},

Henson. Seriously, the woman so regularly kills it on the red carpet, we\u2019re ready to nickname her Buffy the Couture Slayer. At last night\u2019s Academy Awards, she certainly lived up to the moniker, putting her own slightly gothic spin on the goddess-inspired trend that threatened to take over the red carpet.\n\nWearing a sleek bob styled by Tymothe Wallace and a Vera Wang couture gown chosen by stylist Jason Bolden (who also dressed Ava DuVernay this Oscar weekend), the actress showed off her famously toned body with yards of chiffon, sheer paneling and an up-to-there slit, flashing us a gleaming length of leg throughout the evening\u2019s festivities.\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images)\n\nAnd because we never tire of an epic slay here at The Glow Up, when we heard that Henson\u2019s longtime makeup artist Ashunta Sheriff was dishing on the star\u2019s look last night, we naturally wanted the goods. I mean ... who wouldn\u2019t?\n\nFun fact: As both a model and, later, a first-time Grammy nominee, I was blessed to have my face polished to perfection by Ashunta Sheriff. I can personally attest that she is a master of her craft, and a makeup maven who makes contouring a breeze with the first-ever dual-ended foundation stick from her collection, Ashunta Sheriff Beauty. She\u2019s also generous enough to share her expertise: Time spent in her chair is as educational as it is beautifying!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images)\n\nOn that note, here\u2019s our favorite secret to how Sheriff created Henson\u2019s Oscar slay: Several components can be found right in your local drusgtore aisle. For instance, like Issa Rae\u2019s Golden Globes makeup artist, Joanna Simkin, Sheriff looked no further than a reliable household name to make sure Henson\u2019s skin took center stage last night. As she shared with The Glow Up:\n\n1. \u201cBecause Taraji\u2019s dress was Grecian and flowy and showed lots of skin, I wanted to make sure she was glowing and moisturized from head to toe! I used Vaseline Intensive Care Cocoa Radiant Lotion, made with deep healing moisturizers and Vaseline jelly; it was the perfect choice to show off her healthy, luminous skin.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. \u201cTo start off her makeup, I used Fenty Beauty by Rihanna Pro Filt\u2019r Instant Retouch Primer. Then Perfect Blend by Ashunta Sheriff, a dual-ended foundation and concealer that helps you get even in one step. Perfect Blend is the first dual-ended foundation and helps to tone down redness. The formula feels lightweight and wears like a second skin, giving you medium to buildable coverage. I used the shade medium for a natural soft coverage.\n\n\n\n3. \u201cFor Taraji\u2019s already amazing cheekbones, I used my fingertips for a softening effect to highlight, using Danessa Myricks Enlight Illuminator powder in Confidence. Its super-pigmented shimmer is my favorite. I contoured using Cozette S145 Perfect Contour brush and Cozette Infinite Contour Palette to sculpt cheekbones.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. \u201cFor the eyes, I used Kiss Beauty Blowout Lashes in Pixie. These lashes are perfect for sexy and soft looks; plus, Kiss makes affordable lashes that are comparable to high-end brands. I placed lashes close to Taraji\u2019s lash line, then created a thin line using Kiss Waterproof Wonders precision-point eye liner to create definition. I always marry faux lashes and real lashes with Kiss Mascara in Black.\n\n\n\n5. \u201cLastly, I finished the look off with lip liner in MAC Cork and filled in her lips as well, for longevity\u2014layering ensures the color lasts longer. To finish the lip, I applied the Lip Bar Liquid Matte Creme in Savage and Drama Queen.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAshunta Sheriff and Taraji P. Henson are clearly a match made in makeup heaven\u2014after all, what better color to use on Henson than \u201cDrama Queen\u201d? Henson certainly brought the drama last night, and with a slay game this consistent, we\u2019re not sure which we\u2019re more excited about: the Oscar-nominated actress\u2019s next film, or her next appearance on the red carpet!", "keywords": ["oscars", "slays", "using", "red", "henson", "kiss", "carpetagain", "taraji", "ashunta", "sheriff", "makeup", "tarajis", "perfect", "p", "glow", "lashes", "used"], "polarity": 0.1809403559403559, "subjectivity": 0.46866489991489985},

For my money, few rappers could do what he did (pack that much substance into that many bars for that length of time and perform it so flawlessly) THAT well, and almost all of them are named Eminem or part of Slaughterhouse. I won\u2019t rehash all that he covered; that\u2019s been done already. But what has happened is that it should reignite a convo that exists in the rap community: Just where does Black Thought rank in the greatest-of-all-time conversation?\n\nOver the course of my life, I\u2019ve probably had a thousand \u201cWho is in my top five?\u201d discussions, give or take a hundred or so. At almost no time has Black Thought ever cracked my top five, which typically consists of Biggie, Jay, Nas, Andr\u00e9 3000, and Tupac or Ice Cube (AmeriKKKa\u2019s Most Wanted through Lethal Injection). There aren\u2019t any surprises on that list. It\u2019s a fairly standard \u201cmainstream\u201d list of GOATs.\n\nBlack Thought is as good as or a better rapper than every single person on that list. Yet he almost never makes my personal list, and based on the conversations I have, he typically gets left off a lot of other folks\u2019 lists, too, even extending them to top 10s. There are a few reasons why I think that\u2019s happened.\n\nFor starters, I think because he\u2019s part of such a great collective, the Roots, people sometimes forget to think of him in isolated terms. As an entity, the Roots are super beloved and appreciated, but we always lump them into one. Also because of their \u201cfirst hip-hop band\u201d image, I think sometimes Black Thought gets lost in that shuffle.\n\nWhen we think of the Roots, we think of Black Thought and Questlove, but we think of them in tandem and rarely of Black Thought as just pure rapper. Which is why I think every time he goes on shows and ends up spitting something, it stands out so much more. We are thinking of him as a solo entity in those moments, such as the Flex freestyle. Had Black Thought ever released a solo album, I think that might be different.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSecond, he\u2019s been so consistent for so long, spitting at such a high level, that even when you are paying attention to him, it gets easy to overlook just how skilled he is. Which also gets back to him being lost in the collective, so to speak. They make music that often caters so well to his vocals that he sounds more like an instrument than an MC bodying a track. It\u2019s like D\u2019Angelo on Voodoo.\n\nThe most controversial of reasons is this: He sounds ... unexciting. He\u2019s not a sexy pick. I\u2019m a Black Thought fan, but that everyman-show-up-to-work-every-day-without-any-pizzazz thing tends to push him into the \u201cYeah, he\u2019s tight, but he don\u2019t really spark\u201d convo that people like Tim Duncan fell into. Duncan is the Big Fundamental; his game had very little razzle-dazzle or spark, so it was easy to forget you were watching one of the best to ever do it for so long. Of course everybody knows Duncan is one of the greats, but he\u2019ll end up in those conversations in a more interesting way now that his career is over.\n\nI think Black Thought is similar in that sense. Plain and simple, he\u2019s just that damn good. That freestyle wasn\u2019t a revelation for most of us who are familiar with the Roots. It was a super-skilled MC doing what super-skilled MCs do: They get nasty on the mic. For others it may have been an aha moment, and that\u2019s good for him, and hopefully it translates into new fans for him and the Roots.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNone of the aforementioned reasons is particularly deep, but I think they are all relevant. Rappers in groups do struggle for that individual \u201cbest ever\u201d title, and it\u2019s usually when they step out on their own that we really start paying attention to their greatness. The catch here is that in the Roots, Black Thought has done the vast majority of the heavy lifting with assists from Dice Raw and Malik B., etc. Black Thought is primarily a solo MC in a band that we think of like a group.\n\nBut with freestyles like that one or any time he raps alongside musical guests on Jimmy Fallon or spits freestyles while on talk shows, you get the opportunity to appreciate just how special Black Thought is as an MC, IF he gets lost in the group shuffle. So here\u2019s the important question: Where DOES Black Thought rank in the GOAT convo?\n\nGlad you asked. For me? I think if Nas is in that convo, then so is Black Thought if I\u2019m being reasonable. I actually think Black Thought MIGHT be better than Nas, though Nas will always have Illmatic, which ensures his rap Mount Rushmore status for influence and impressiveness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBiggie will always be in my top five because I don\u2019t think there was a single weakness in his skill set, but I struggle with GOAT because of limited catalog, for obvious reasons. Jay is likely always going to be No. 1 because of how good he\u2019s been for so long and because of his cultural impact and footprint.\n\nBlack Thought, while being easily one of the most skilled rappers to ever do it, doesn\u2019t have the cultural impact piece, THOUGH the Roots are easily one of the most recognizable acts in hip-hop, especially as the backing band for Fallon. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re an unknown outfit. They have platinum and gold albums and six albums that opened in the top 10 on the Billboard pop charts, and 10 albums that opened in the top 10 of the R&B charts. Clearly, they\u2019re a band with a presence and are well-known enough to have an impact. Pretty much any outfit where rap is prominently featured out front and there\u2019s a backing band is following in their footsteps.\n\nHere\u2019s another thing: If you ask any MC who their top MCs are, Black Thought is more often than not going to end up in that number. So his impact is felt and he\u2019s universally respected as one of the best to ever do it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo what\u2019s the point of it all? It\u2019s this: While I think everybody is aware of and knows that Black Thought is a great rapper, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s gotten his just due in the conversations for GOAT. That Flex freestyle is a reminder why he should. If not for the pleasure, at least for the principle.\n\nBlack Thought is one of the best to ever do it; that\u2019s indisputable. Where does he rank on that GOAT list?

Yo no s\u00e9.\n\nBut the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame recently announced its 2018 inductees, a list that includes Nina Simone, Bon Jovi, the Cars, Dire Straits, Sister Rosetta Thorpe and the Moody Blues. A fine group of performers, some of whom you love and some of whom you probably hate. It\u2019s music and it\u2019s subjective. But their accomplishments are undeniable. In fact, inquiring why it took so long for all of those people to get in would be fair.\n\nAlso nominated but not selected for 2018? One James Todd Smith, better known to the world as LL Cool J. Including 2018, he\u2019s been on the ballot four times. How in the hell has he NOT gotten in?\n\nI realize that we don\u2019t care about Grammys or Oscars or Halls of Fame or any accolades, especially in hip-hop. Or so we say. According to Phife Dawg (RIP) on the song \u201cAward Tour\u201d from 1993\u2019s Midnight Marauders album, \u201cI\u2019ll never let a statue tell me how nice I am ... \u201d\n\nMeanwhile, in 2017, Q-Tip felt a way about being snubbed by the Grammys. So even if we as a community pretend we don\u2019t care, validation is validation and acknowledgment is acknowledgment, and we all like it\u2014especially for hip-hop, which has had to fight and claw its way into being respected by the mainstream gatekeepers DESPITE being the predominant musical form of the USA and, really, the world. I mean, everybody loves Tupac.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is not devoid of black artists. They ain\u2019t stupid. Artists from Sam Cooke to Gladys Knight & the Pips to Aretha Franklin to Bo Diddley to Jimmy Cliff to Bob Marley to the Jackson 5 to Michael Jackson all grace the annals of the Hall of Fame. And while I\u2019m sure there was a time when black artists struggled for that acknowledgment, we are all up and through there now.\n\nEXCEPT for the world of hip-hop, where, despite the genre\u2019s contributions to the WORLD, the only current inductees are Grandmaster Flash & the Furious Five, Run-DMC, Public Enemy, N.W.A and Tupac. A fine list of people who fit the criteria for the Hall of Fame\u2019s inductees: \u201cArtists\u2014a group encompassing performers, composers and/or musicians ... demonstrating unquestionable musical excellence and talent [who] have had a significant impact on the development, evolution and preservation of rock & roll.\u201d Obviously, the use of rock \u2019n\u2019 roll is the widest general definition, considering the various acts and individuals included therein.\n\nBut THEREIN lies my own confusion about the exclusion of LL Cool J. As a cultural icon and embodiment of everything the Hall of Fame exists to showcase, LL should have gone in when Run-DMC did, basically. As a solo act, especially. Every other act belongs there, but so does LL. While LL isn\u2019t the best at ANY particular realm of hip-hop, what he DOES have is the longevity tab on lock. We STILL know this man. He\u2019s still relevant\u2014maybe not as a musical artist, but for what you can do with your hip-hop celebrity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut even musically, he gave us Mama Said Knock You Out, Mr. Smith and Bigger and Deffer. He has seven No. 1 rap singles. Four top 10 U.S. singles in a time before hip-hop was entirely embraced by the country. He\u2019s got classic songs and, more important, is the REASON so many of those early rappers even decided to pick up microphones. He\u2019s been influential.\n\nIn hip-hop, he\u2019s one of the most well-known stalwarts of the most famed hip-hop label that\u2019s ever existed. He leveraged his hip-hop bona fides into commercials, movies and television. He took hip-hop to the boardrooms and got that corporate money there. He got FUBU into a Gap commercial.\n\nHow influential does an artist need to be to get that recognition, IF we\u2019re recognizing artists for those reasons? I have no idea if LL Cool J cares. I\u2019m sure he would like to be inducted, since it is a great honor and at this point of his career, musically, that\u2019s about all he has left to accomplish. Maybe it\u2019s not that big a deal to him, but since he\u2019s been nominated, NOT being inducted must be a little annoying, especially on this fourth go-round.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m sure that at some point he\u2019ll get in, as will artists like Jay-Z, Biggie, Puffy, Nas, DJ Kool Herc, DJ Premier and others, on sheer influence on hip-hop alone. I also think that Rakim belongs in there because he was YEARS ahead of his time and his influence cannot be measured even if he doesn\u2019t get universal credit for it. But it would be a shame for him not to get in soon, especially considering the other hip-hop acts that are in, as they\u2019re his contemporaries in the art form. Tupac is moving into the \u201990s.

We saw some solid debuts and some great sophomore follow-ups. To be honest, there aren\u2019t many projects released this year that I can say I viscerally hated, but that won\u2019t stop me from complaining about some of this year\u2019s biggest and most acclaimed albums that I just couldn\u2019t go up for. So in the spirit of Festivus, without further ado (in no particular ranking order), here are five albums released in 2017 that I never, ever, ever have to listen to again.\n\n1. CTRL, by SZA\n\nI really wanted to like this album. I\u2019ve been a huge fan of SZA since her early Soundcloud EP days, and while I realize I\u2019m going to sound like such an unbearable hipster, I like her old \u201cunderground\u201d shit a lot better. I get why CTRL resonates so much with its intended audience; that aside, in comparison with her other projects, it\u2019s quite lackluster.\n\nThe indie-artist welcome-to-my-kitchen accent thing she\u2019s doing is way more exaggerated on CTRL than on any of her other EPs. It\u2019s so ridiculous, it almost makes songs like \u201cSupermodel\u201d unlistenable. She sounds like a melaninneal (melanated and millennial) Barbara Walters warbling about heartache and insecurity throughout most of the album. A real disappointment. I just listen to \u201cSweet November,\u201d \u201cCountry\u201d and \u201cBed\u201d instead.\n\n\n\n2. More Life, by Drake\n\nAre we calling this an album or a \u201cplaylist\u201d? It doesn\u2019t matter\u2014it\u2019s going on the list. Like Views, More Life is more of Drake\u2019s new brand of global pop casserole that I DO NOT ENJOY. Do you know how it feels to be the only person who didn\u2019t instinctively wine their hips when \u201cPassionfruit\u201d came on in 2017??? Isolating. It\u2019s like being a Republican who believes in climate change. Even \u201cFake Love\u201d gets on my nerves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDrake has the vocal range of a dial tone, and while that may work on certain songs, I just cannot withstand a whole-ass project of his rhythmic humming and \u201cname that Diasporic accent\u201d challenges. The only thing I\u2019ve missed out on by avoiding Drake\u2019s music is being able to recognize when his songs are being referenced in dramatic picture captions on Instagram. I regret nothing.\n\n\n\n3. DAMN., by Kendrick Lamar\n\nDon\u2019t you just hate it when you can tell that a writer has no meaningful critique of a very popular and critically acclaimed album and can only offer shallow contrarianism? I don\u2019t know what it is, but every time I see K. Dot and his Black Israelite protective styles, my eyes begin to instinctively roll. Does this album have any other songs that people even like besides \u201cHumble\u201d and \u201cDNA\u201d?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is the album that I imagine is gonna be played at that \u201ccookout\u201d y\u2019all keep inviting all those white people to for showing a modicum of human decency, and I\u2019ll be more than pleased to miss out on teaching Deb and them how to \u201chit dem folks\u201d to \u201cLoyalty.\u201d\n\n4. Drunk, by Thundercat\n\nIs it OK to admit that Donald Glover made a better Thundercat album with Awaken, My Love! last year?

We practiced his juking moves in the mirror, our hands too small to hold the ball loosely, the way he did. We even wanted to go to U.S.C., where he led the nation in rushing two years in a row. We were angry when he lost the Heisman Trophy to the white, All-American, clean-cut U.C.L.A. quarterback Gary Beban, known as \u2018The Great One.\u2019 We were triumphant when he won it the next year.\u2019\n\n\n\nBaquet\u2019s 35-minute interview, posted Wednesday, is to appear in the New York Times Style Magazine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe continued, \u201cBut O.J. was not a perfect hero for young black boys, even though he launched himself from poverty in San Francisco to superstardom. He was racially ambivalent. At a time when other athletes were starting to make their blackness a cause, he was trying to make his a footnote.\n\n\u201cSo when I was invited to interview Jay-Z, I wanted to talk about his song \u2018The Story of O.J.,\u2019 from his most recent album, \u20184:44,\u2019 in which he quotes the legendary, maybe apocryphal, Simpson line \u2018I\u2019m not black, I\u2019m O.J.\u2019\n\n\u201cI was less engaged by the rapper\u2019s marital troubles or his infamous, caught-on-video 2014 elevator dust-up with his sister-in-law. But I did want to try to understand how, with an $88 million Bel Air mansion a freeway ride from neighborhoods where black people endure with so little, Jay-Z holds onto his younger self \u2014 a black man who grew up in the \u201970s in the Marcy projects of Brooklyn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt seemed from his new body of work that examining this high-wire act of straddling two places had been stirring more deeply within him \u2014 much the way it stirs in me, a Southern black man who grew up revering O.J. and whose own success is infinitely greater than anyone in my early life would have imagined for me.\n\n\u201cWhat is it about the story of O.J.

Is there an adjective form of toe-may?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cToe-may?

It actually might be happening more frequently now, since I\u2019m doing more panels and talks. And on said panels and talks, I\u2019ll think about a point I made in something I wrote and attempt to articulate that point. But then I\u2019ll think, \u201cHoly shit.

I\u2019m still communicating with people regularly, but all of those communications are either through email, chat, Slack or text. (This is where people who know me are probably like, \u201cUmm. You don\u2019t communicate at all, nigga.\u201d But baby steps!)\n\nAnyway, with some of those words, I just never had the opportunity to say them aloud or hear someone say them.

Henson. Seriously, the woman so regularly kills it on the red carpet, we\u2019re ready to nickname her Buffy the Couture Slayer. At last night\u2019s Academy Awards, she certainly lived up to the moniker, putting her own slightly gothic spin on the goddess-inspired trend that threatened to take over the red carpet.\n\nWearing a sleek bob styled by Tymothe Wallace and a Vera Wang couture gown chosen by stylist Jason Bolden (who also dressed Ava DuVernay this Oscar weekend), the actress showed off her famously toned body with yards of chiffon, sheer paneling and an up-to-there slit, flashing us a gleaming length of leg throughout the evening\u2019s festivities.\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images)\n\nAnd because we never tire of an epic slay here at The Glow Up, when we heard that Henson\u2019s longtime makeup artist Ashunta Sheriff was dishing on the star\u2019s look last night, we naturally wanted the goods. I mean ... who wouldn\u2019t?\n\nFun fact: As both a model and, later, a first-time Grammy nominee, I was blessed to have my face polished to perfection by Ashunta Sheriff. I can personally attest that she is a master of her craft, and a makeup maven who makes contouring a breeze with the first-ever dual-ended foundation stick from her collection, Ashunta Sheriff Beauty. She\u2019s also generous enough to share her expertise: Time spent in her chair is as educational as it is beautifying!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images)\n\nOn that note, here\u2019s our favorite secret to how Sheriff created Henson\u2019s Oscar slay: Several components can be found right in your local drusgtore aisle. For instance, like Issa Rae\u2019s Golden Globes makeup artist, Joanna Simkin, Sheriff looked no further than a reliable household name to make sure Henson\u2019s skin took center stage last night. As she shared with The Glow Up:\n\n1. \u201cBecause Taraji\u2019s dress was Grecian and flowy and showed lots of skin, I wanted to make sure she was glowing and moisturized from head to toe! I used Vaseline Intensive Care Cocoa Radiant Lotion, made with deep healing moisturizers and Vaseline jelly; it was the perfect choice to show off her healthy, luminous skin.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. \u201cTo start off her makeup, I used Fenty Beauty by Rihanna Pro Filt\u2019r Instant Retouch Primer. Then Perfect Blend by Ashunta Sheriff, a dual-ended foundation and concealer that helps you get even in one step. Perfect Blend is the first dual-ended foundation and helps to tone down redness. The formula feels lightweight and wears like a second skin, giving you medium to buildable coverage. I used the shade medium for a natural soft coverage.\n\n\n\n3. \u201cFor Taraji\u2019s already amazing cheekbones, I used my fingertips for a softening effect to highlight, using Danessa Myricks Enlight Illuminator powder in Confidence. Its super-pigmented shimmer is my favorite. I contoured using Cozette S145 Perfect Contour brush and Cozette Infinite Contour Palette to sculpt cheekbones.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. \u201cFor the eyes, I used Kiss Beauty Blowout Lashes in Pixie. These lashes are perfect for sexy and soft looks; plus, Kiss makes affordable lashes that are comparable to high-end brands. I placed lashes close to Taraji\u2019s lash line, then created a thin line using Kiss Waterproof Wonders precision-point eye liner to create definition. I always marry faux lashes and real lashes with Kiss Mascara in Black.\n\n\n\n5. \u201cLastly, I finished the look off with lip liner in MAC Cork and filled in her lips as well, for longevity\u2014layering ensures the color lasts longer. To finish the lip, I applied the Lip Bar Liquid Matte Creme in Savage and Drama Queen.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAshunta Sheriff and Taraji P. Henson are clearly a match made in makeup heaven\u2014after all, what better color to use on Henson than \u201cDrama Queen\u201d? Henson certainly brought the drama last night, and with a slay game this consistent, we\u2019re not sure which we\u2019re more excited about: the Oscar-nominated actress\u2019s next film, or her next appearance on the red carpet!", "keywords": ["oscars", "slays", "using", "red", "henson", "kiss", "carpetagain", "taraji", "ashunta", "sheriff", "makeup", "tarajis", "perfect", "p", "glow", "lashes", "used"], "polarity": 0.1809403559403559, "subjectivity": 0.46866489991489985},

Is there an adjective form of toe-may?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cToe-may? What do you mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know, the word to describe a really long and heavy piece of text.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mean tome?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna go get some lunch.\u201d\n\nThese are just two examples, but I have dozens more of me publicly butchering words that I know very well and use while writing quite regularly. It actually might be happening more frequently now, since I\u2019m doing more panels and talks. And on said panels and talks, I\u2019ll think about a point I made in something I wrote and attempt to articulate that point. But then I\u2019ll think, \u201cHoly shit. I\u2019ve never actually said that word or that sequence of words aloud before.\u201d And then I\u2019ll do the low-mumble thing and hope no one notices.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, in my defense, there\u2019s a decent explanation of why this dynamic exists. I just don\u2019t talk very much. I\u2019ve gone entire days\u2014sometimes three or four days in a row\u2014without saying a word to anyone other than my wife and daughter. I\u2019m still communicating with people regularly, but all of those communications are either through email, chat, Slack or text. (This is where people who know me are probably like, \u201cUmm. You don\u2019t communicate at all, nigga.\u201d But baby steps!)\n\nAnyway, with some of those words, I just never had the opportunity to say them aloud or hear someone say them. And when it\u2019s my time to say it aloud, I just guess and hope I\u2019m right or mumble and hope there are enough context clues there for them to know what I mean.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t make it feel any less paradoxical, though. And it\u2019s especially paradoxical right now, at this exact moment, because I\u2019m just now realizing I\u2019ve never said paradoxical aloud, either.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s pronounced \u201cpa-ra-doe-x-cow,\u201d right?", "keywords": ["living", "write", "actually", "words", "know", "aloud", "im", "word", "say", "think", "pronounce", "confession", "zeitgeist", "dont"], "polarity": 0.10348356009070292, "subjectivity": 0.43785474446188727},

The film has been applauded by black people across the world for touching on the complex relationships between Africans and African Americans, for serving up positive images of African culture for global audiences, and for providing a vehicle that allows black people throughout the world to showcase their heritage and their pride.\n\n\n\nAs a recent article from The Intercept explains, this influence has shown up in Brazil in the form of rolezinho pretoi, which roughly translates to \u201cblack stroll,\u201d in which large groups of Afro-Brazilians turn up together to walk about an area. The stroll has a recent history of being a form of protest in Brazil.\n\nIn the Intercept piece, one group of Afro-Brazilians coordinated a rolezinho to watch Black Panther at one of Rio de Janeiro\u2019s most exclusive high-end shopping malls, Leblon. As the writer notes, Leblon is couched in one of the most affluent areas in Brazil and is also a predominantly white space in a country where the majority of the population now identifies as black or mixed race.\n\nThis made the Black Panther screening as much a political act as a celebration.\n\nFrom The Intercept:\n\nOrganizers would start an event on Facebook and call for everyone to meet at a certain mall at a certain time. Young, mostly dark-skinned residents of the city\u2019s poor and working-class neighborhoods on the urban periphery would take a sometimes one- or two-hour train or bus ride to shopping centers in the bougiest enclaves and just go for a walkabout. In some cases, thousands showed up, much to the horror of Brazil\u2019s white elite, whose ever-present racial and class-based fears were palpable. Malls, including Shopping Leblon, closed down in anticipation of these protests. Others were broken up with tear gas and rubber bullets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe rolezinho for the global blockbuster, then, was a way to celebrate blackness in a highly visible way, to reclaim a highly segregated and exclusive space.\n\nReinaldo Junior, an actor who participated in a recent rolezinho, told The Intercept, \u201cWe wanted to occupy this space today to say, \u2018We are alive.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWe almost never see any of our people in this kind of space. It\u2019s as though this space is only meant for white people,\u201d said Lucin\u00edo Janu\u00e1rio, another actor. \u201cSo when we have a film written by black man, with black actors and black producers, we felt it was our duty to occupy this space so we could serve as an example.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYgor Marinho, a 28-year-old student who participated in the recent rolezinho and watched Black Panther for the first time, said that the movie\u2019s black-majority cast filled him with pride.\n\n\u201cIt makes me want to win. It makes me want to fight. It makes me like myself more, like my own skin tone, like my kind of hair, like the shape of my nose, like the shape of my lips, like myself more,\u201d Marinho told The Intercept, \u201cbecause you start to see people who are like you, and you see how they carry themselves\u2014empowered, happy with themselves\u2014and you start to like yourself better.\u201d", "keywords": ["recent", "occupy", "inspires", "space", "rolezinho", "brazilians", "spaces", "shopping", "white", "makes", "panther", "intercept", "whitedominant", "black", "start"], "polarity": 0.11405685932001719, "subjectivity": 0.4190486316802105},

During this year\u2019s Carnival in Brazil, blackface made an appearance not only on the streets but also in the parades of three samba schools: Mangueira, Salgueiro and Beija Flor.\n\nUnlike the United States, where black men are the main subjects of blackface, black women are the main targets of blackface in Brazil. Nega Maluca is a white man\u2019s interpretation of a black woman. She\u2019s usually represented as a person painted black with an Afro wig, domestic servant\u2019s outfit, large breasts and exaggerated facial features.\n\n\u201cNega Maluca stereotypes and ridicule[s] the black woman, sexualizing her and stereotyping her as a sex object. She has big breasts and large lips,\u201d Eliane Pereira, a lawyer in Rio de Janeiro, tells The Glow Up. \u201cThis comes from the time period of slavery, when we were colonized and the black woman was always seen as an object. This woman does not represent me.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe history of the Nega Maluca blackface is closely intertwined with the history of black women in Brazil. The 1950s Carnival song \u201cNega Maluca\u201d tells the story of a black woman who works as a domestic servant and is impregnated by her white boss\u2014something that was common back then. When she demands that the father claim the baby, she is called a \u201cnega maluca\u201d\u2014a crazy black woman.\n\nIn the 75 years after slavery ended in Brazil, the most common form of work for a black woman was working as a domestic servant, often living in her boss\u2019s house. To popularize the song, the composer started to include the image of Nega Maluca, interpreted by a white man.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis history of Nega Maluca is hidden on the internet, because today, Nega Maluca is also the name of a Brazilian chocolate cake.\n\nLawyer Marina Mar\u00e7al dreamed of parading with the Mangueira samba school\u2014Rio de Janeiro\u2019s most prestigious and traditional samba school. A samba school is a cultural organization created by blacks in Rio de Janeiro 90 years ago to celebrate samba music during Carnival. Since their founding, the groups have evolved into Brazil\u2019s biggest Carnival attraction. Thousands of costumed people parade each year in the biggest schools.\n\nMar\u00e7al joined the Mangueira school as a \u201ccommunity\u201d member\u2014a discounted way to participate in the Carnival parade without having to pay an outrageous fee, and the main way blacks participate in Carnival. One month after she joined the school, she learned that one of the sections would have some people dressed in the Nega Maluca costume.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMar\u00e7al says that she tried to reason with Mangueira\u2019s officials. She explained the racist history of the costume and why it should not be in the school\u2019s parade. But she said that school officials disagreed and kept the costume in the parade because they felt it was art and not racism.\n\n\n\n\u201cRacism is not an opinion but a crime,\u201d said Mar\u00e7al, who will soon receive a master\u2019s degree in race relations. \u201cWhen you are showing a racist persona of a black woman in a section that includes black women who are saying that Nega Maluca is very offensive, those concerns ought to be taken seriously.\u201d\n\nMar\u00e7al left the Mangueira samba school, and for the last two months, she has tried to educate as many people as possible about the racist origins of the Nega Maluca costume. Seventeen black women were interviewed for a documentary on its origins titled, Nega Maluca N\u00e3o. And Rio de Janeiro\u2019s women\u2019s law association hosted a forum on Nega Maluca right before Carnival.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven a parade that exalted the history and heritage of black women used blackface.\n\nThe theme for the Salgueiro samba school was \u201cSenhoras do Ventre do Mundo,\u201d which translates to \u201cWomen of the Womb of the World,\u201d meant to celebrate the history of black women.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe school\u2019s dance group was composed of men dressed as women, with their faces painted black. The costumes of the drum section, consisting of black and white people, were inspired by the images of the 25th dynasty of Nubia, and those performers also had their faces painted black. But while the public loved their celebration of black women, the blackface costumes dominated the social media discussion.\n\nA modern form of blackface also reared its head at this year\u2019s street Carnival festivities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSinger Jojo Todynho\u2019s song \u201cQue Tiro Foi Esse (What Are These Gunshots)\u201d is a hit in Brazil. But before her popular funk song brought her national fame, she was well-known on the internet for proudly displaying her triple-G breasts in skimpy Brazilian bikinis. This Carnival, she became a costume, with white women and men wearing large, fake brown breasts and black wigs and sometimes even painting their skin dark.\n\nBut though the tradition continues, there is increasing resistance. In Minas Gerais, the carnival bloco Domesticas de Lixo (Male Domestic Servants of Trash) consists of white men who dress up as black domestic servants as a way to pay homage to the domestic servant. This year, several black YouTube bloggers mounted a campaign against the bloco, which celebrated its 60th anniversary by receiving a key to the city from the mayor. At least a dozen Afro-Brazilians protested the bloco\u2019s parade two weeks ago.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMar\u00e7al says that she thinks blackface in Brazil will end only if Brazilians start listening to Afro-Brazilian women.\n\n\u201cCarnival comes from black culture, but they ignore the opinions of black people,\u201d she says.\n\n", "keywords": ["carnival", "samba", "maluca", "2018", "blackface", "school", "white", "women", "black", "misogynoir", "woman", "nega", "brazils"], "polarity": -0.047854526425955016, "subjectivity": 0.4117739403453689},

She was strong, tall, elegant, gracious, and I saw myself in her. I cried because her beauty was the same type of beauty that I have. It was a relief to see her being celebrated. For many decades in the United States, I was not considered pretty. I was strange. They thought my skin was too dark. My arms and legs were very large.\n\nEvery year, 16 Afro-Brazilian women compete to become the Queen of Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea, an Afro-Bloco carnival group in Salvador, Brazil, that promotes black pride and Afro-Brazilian culture in Brazil. Afro-Brazilians in the neighborhood of Liberdade started Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea in 1975 in resistance to Salvador\u2019s carnival, which at the time excluded blacks. The group derives its heritage from Candombl\u00e9, an Afro-Brazilian religion traditionally led by women. Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea has traditionally been a carnival group for dark-skinned black people in Salvador, and the contestants of the Beleza Negra pageant represent this aesthetic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe goal of the Beleza Negra is to represent black women in a way that Brazilian and international media fail to\u2014as strong, spirit-filled and divine. Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea\u2019s theme this year was \u201c100 Years of Madiba: Nelson Mandela\u201d; contestants represented this in their dresses. The winner of the pageant will now reign as the Queen of Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea\u2019s carnival, and her responsibilities include representing the Afro-Bloco in and outside Brazil, as well as dancing in carnival during the group\u2019s parade.\n\n\u201cThe Goddess of Ebony contest is a validation of representation,\u201d Neal, 35, told a Brazilian newspaper. \u201cIt is very much needed here, [and] all over the world. To me, it says, \u2018I am here, I am valid, I exist, I have a proud history, I have beautiful cultural narratives and I am not alone.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNeal traveled back to Salvador to prepare and compete, thanks to a fundraising campaign she started once she learned that Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea had accepted her application for the pageant. On the day she arrived, she went straight from the airport to her first practice with the other contestants, who ranged in age from 18 to their 40s. All but four came from Salvador.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was dropping a kitten in a bunny cage,\u201d said Neal, who is a director, filmmaker, photographer and writer. \u201cThe other contestants didn\u2019t quite know what to make of me. They didn\u2019t know if I was a novelty or serious competitor. I was fatigued, sweating, and my eyes were bloodshot from all the travel.\u201d\n\nShe made waves in Salvador and was featured on the front page of the local newspaper. The local population supported her participation in the pageant, which has traditionally been seen as a way to promote black women from local communities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think that the overall impact has been positive,\u201d said Adrian Erik McCray, a longtime African-American expat in Salvador. \u201cThe fact that an African American\u2014\u2018an elite,\u2019 in the eyes of Brazil\u2014chose to participate in something that revives the resistance spirit of Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea is something positive.\u201d\n\nOnce settled in Salvador, Neal scrambled desperately to find someone who could create the two required dresses\u2014one representing Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea and another representing a deity. She then learned a special dance that\u2014more so than beauty\u2014defines the Ebony Goddess.\n\nNeal found a savior in 27-year-old Cec\u00edlia Cadile, an entrepreneur who placed third in last year\u2019s Beleza Negra. Cadile\u2019s involvement in the pageant dates back to when she was a teenager, when her sister competed in the pageant. In the two weeks before the pageant, Cadile worked as Neal\u2019s coach, teaching her the special Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea dance and helping to prepare her two dresses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a already precious stone, and she only needed someone to help bring out the shine in her,\u201d Cadile said.\n\nContestants pose with last year\u2019s Deusa de \u00c9bano, Gisele Santos Soares.

Neal had already developed an intimate relationship with Afro-Brazilian culture and music through her participation in a Brazilian drumming group in the U.S., but she did not grow up with the rhythms and dances of Candombl\u00e9, a handicap she overcame within two weeks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThese women have been doing this all of their lives as part of their experience in Candomble,\u201d Neal said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t born in Candombl\u00e9.\u201d\n\nWhen the moment came for her to perform her dance, Neal put her heart, soul and even stomach into it:\n\nRight before I was about to go on, we were standing in a narrow, one-window hallway backstage, and it was really uncomfortable. I was hot, I was breathless, I was dizzy, I needed to sit down, I needed to stand up. I needed to eat something, I needed to throw up ... all these contradictions! I perform and I\u2019m fine. As soon as I get offstage, I\u2019m sick again. I can\u2019t breathe, I\u2019m hot, I\u2019m sleepy, I\u2019m awake ... then I\u2019m fine. I go to where I can see the rest of the contestants, and as they come offstage to the holding area, they\u2019re all going through the same or similar feelings as I am: hot, breathless, crying, shaking.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNeal didn\u2019t win the contest. The new Deusa de Ebano is J\u00e9ssica Almeida Nascimento dos Santos, 19, who hails from the Cabula neighborhood in Salvador.\n\n\u201cI felt like I did what I came to do and was satisfied,\u201d Neal said. \u201cI didn\u2019t win, obviously, but I feel emotionally amazing.\u201d", "keywords": ["afrobrazilian", "il\u00ea", "needed", "competed", "im", "beauty", "goddess", "contestants", "salvador", "aiy\u00ea", "women", "queen", "ebony", "africanamerican", "pageant", "woman", "neal"], "polarity": 0.10597478544846965, "subjectivity": 0.4534500075947444},

Henson. Seriously, the woman so regularly kills it on the red carpet, we\u2019re ready to nickname her Buffy the Couture Slayer. At last night\u2019s Academy Awards, she certainly lived up to the moniker, putting her own slightly gothic spin on the goddess-inspired trend that threatened to take over the red carpet.\n\nWearing a sleek bob styled by Tymothe Wallace and a Vera Wang couture gown chosen by stylist Jason Bolden (who also dressed Ava DuVernay this Oscar weekend), the actress showed off her famously toned body with yards of chiffon, sheer paneling and an up-to-there slit, flashing us a gleaming length of leg throughout the evening\u2019s festivities.\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images)\n\nAnd because we never tire of an epic slay here at The Glow Up, when we heard that Henson\u2019s longtime makeup artist Ashunta Sheriff was dishing on the star\u2019s look last night, we naturally wanted the goods. I mean ... who wouldn\u2019t?\n\nFun fact: As both a model and, later, a first-time Grammy nominee, I was blessed to have my face polished to perfection by Ashunta Sheriff. I can personally attest that she is a master of her craft, and a makeup maven who makes contouring a breeze with the first-ever dual-ended foundation stick from her collection, Ashunta Sheriff Beauty. She\u2019s also generous enough to share her expertise: Time spent in her chair is as educational as it is beautifying!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images)\n\nOn that note, here\u2019s our favorite secret to how Sheriff created Henson\u2019s Oscar slay: Several components can be found right in your local drusgtore aisle. For instance, like Issa Rae\u2019s Golden Globes makeup artist, Joanna Simkin, Sheriff looked no further than a reliable household name to make sure Henson\u2019s skin took center stage last night. As she shared with The Glow Up:\n\n1. \u201cBecause Taraji\u2019s dress was Grecian and flowy and showed lots of skin, I wanted to make sure she was glowing and moisturized from head to toe! I used Vaseline Intensive Care Cocoa Radiant Lotion, made with deep healing moisturizers and Vaseline jelly; it was the perfect choice to show off her healthy, luminous skin.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. \u201cTo start off her makeup, I used Fenty Beauty by Rihanna Pro Filt\u2019r Instant Retouch Primer. Then Perfect Blend by Ashunta Sheriff, a dual-ended foundation and concealer that helps you get even in one step. Perfect Blend is the first dual-ended foundation and helps to tone down redness. The formula feels lightweight and wears like a second skin, giving you medium to buildable coverage. I used the shade medium for a natural soft coverage.\n\n\n\n3. \u201cFor Taraji\u2019s already amazing cheekbones, I used my fingertips for a softening effect to highlight, using Danessa Myricks Enlight Illuminator powder in Confidence. Its super-pigmented shimmer is my favorite. I contoured using Cozette S145 Perfect Contour brush and Cozette Infinite Contour Palette to sculpt cheekbones.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. \u201cFor the eyes, I used Kiss Beauty Blowout Lashes in Pixie. These lashes are perfect for sexy and soft looks; plus, Kiss makes affordable lashes that are comparable to high-end brands. I placed lashes close to Taraji\u2019s lash line, then created a thin line using Kiss Waterproof Wonders precision-point eye liner to create definition. I always marry faux lashes and real lashes with Kiss Mascara in Black.\n\n\n\n5. \u201cLastly, I finished the look off with lip liner in MAC Cork and filled in her lips as well, for longevity\u2014layering ensures the color lasts longer. To finish the lip, I applied the Lip Bar Liquid Matte Creme in Savage and Drama Queen.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAshunta Sheriff and Taraji P. Henson are clearly a match made in makeup heaven\u2014after all, what better color to use on Henson than \u201cDrama Queen\u201d?

It actually might be happening more frequently now, since I\u2019m doing more panels and talks. And on said panels and talks, I\u2019ll think about a point I made in something I wrote and attempt to articulate that point. But then I\u2019ll think, \u201cHoly shit. I\u2019ve never actually said that word or that sequence of words aloud before.\u201d And then I\u2019ll do the low-mumble thing and hope no one notices.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, in my defense, there\u2019s a decent explanation of why this dynamic exists. I just don\u2019t talk very much. I\u2019ve gone entire days\u2014sometimes three or four days in a row\u2014without saying a word to anyone other than my wife and daughter. I\u2019m still communicating with people regularly, but all of those communications are either through email, chat, Slack or text. (This is where people who know me are probably like, \u201cUmm. You don\u2019t communicate at all, nigga.\u201d But baby steps!)\n\nAnyway, with some of those words, I just never had the opportunity to say them aloud or hear someone say them. And when it\u2019s my time to say it aloud, I just guess and hope I\u2019m right or mumble and hope there are enough context clues there for them to know what I mean.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t make it feel any less paradoxical, though. And it\u2019s especially paradoxical right now, at this exact moment, because I\u2019m just now realizing I\u2019ve never said paradoxical aloud, either.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s pronounced \u201cpa-ra-doe-x-cow,\u201d right?", "keywords": ["living", "write", "actually", "words", "know", "aloud", "im", "word", "say", "think", "pronounce", "confession", "zeitgeist", "dont"], "polarity": 0.10348356009070292, "subjectivity": 0.43785474446188727},

The city she lived in and schools she attended were mostly white. But when she moved to Campinas, a city of 1 million approximately two hours outside of Sao Paulo, she decided to be proactive.\n\n\u201cI wanted to increase my connection to Afro-Brazilian people,\u201d she says.\n\nThaisa joined Afrodengo, an Afro-Brazilian dating community on Facebook. When she finally got up the nerve to post her photo and introduced herself\u2014a requirement of the community\u2014she noticed that one guy who \u201cliked\u201d her photo lived in her city. His name was Jackson Xavier.\n\nShe reached out to him on Facebook and they immediately started talking. Two days later, they went out on their first date. She instantly liked his intelligence, responsibility and the way he cared for her. He liked her stubbornness, humor and intelligence as well. Five months later, the couple were married. As Jackson explains:\n\nBefore the group, I didn\u2019t even think to look for relationships with black women, and I had never had a black girlfriend. But once I entered the group, I started to focus more on having a relationship with a black person like me because we have similar experiences. The black movement is very strong on the internet, so I entered the group wanting to see more beautiful black people and to have references in my life to black things.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfrodengo was created one year ago by Afro-Brazilian journalist and single mother Lorena If\u00e9, 29, to promote love and marriage among Afro-Brazilians. \u201cDengo\u201d is a word with African roots that Brazilians\u2014especially Afro-Brazilians\u2014call people to show love and care. Despite the country\u2019s African origins, hundreds of years of slavery and European colonialism have made affection and stable relationships between black women and black men in Brazil unique and unusual.\n\nNow Afro-Brazilians are flocking to the Afrodengo Facebook group to build relationships that they never before considered having. But If\u00e9 not only wants to spark love among Afro-Brazilians; she also wants to help them build relationships with one another so that they can combat racism in Brazil. She explains:\n\nHaving relationships between black people is a way to combat racism. Only a black person will know how racism affects you and its consequences in our lives. In a society where we learn to hate ourselves, if we unite with people like us, then we can combat racism with something as simple as having a conscious family.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo jump-start the group, If\u00e9 invited Afro-Brazilian men and women to post photos and descriptions of themselves. Within a week, it exploded\u2014with both members and photos. At one point, If\u00e9 had more than 10,000 people waiting to be approved to the group. If\u00e9 created an environment where every type of black person, regardless of sexuality, sex, religion or political viewpoint, is welcome.\n\nToday the group is still going strong; having produced at least two marriages and countless couples and friendships. There are more than 100,000 members in the main group and its affiliates (which focus on LGBT members, Christians and body positivity). If\u00e9 plans to turn the Facebook group into an app.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Afro-Brazilians enjoy the group, some white Brazilians consider If\u00e9 and the group racist because it is exclusively for black people. For African Americans, a dating site for black people seems obvious. But for Brazilians, communities restricted by race are always frowned upon. White Brazilians also want to be a part of the group.\n\n\u201cTo this day, I have to deny entrance to white people who want to join the group,\u201d If\u00e9 said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe creation of Afrodengo stems from If\u00e9\u2019s personal experiences pursuing amor afrocentrado\u2014\u201dblack love\u201d\u2014 in Salvador, Brazil. While in a relationship with her son\u2019s father, she felt that their relationship lacked the affection she sees given to white women in Brazil. Soon after they broke up, she tried her hand at online dating and even created a profile on Tinder. But although she lives in a city that is more than 80 percent black, she couldn\u2019t find any black men on the platform.\n\nIf\u00e9 says she wasn\u2019t raised with affection\u2014which is common among poor Afro-Brazilians simply trying to survive. Personally, she longs for a black man who will cherish her intelligence and give her affection when she wants\u2014even when she doesn\u2019t need it. She still longs for an \u201cAfrodengo.\u201d\n\nCreating this Afrodengo [was] a way to help me survive and help others going through a similar situation. It helped me to move on from my relationship and survive my depression.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf\u00e9\u2019s struggle is one that many black women in Brazil share. Many of their lives are marked by loneliness (solid\u00e3o da Mulher Negra) because they aren\u2019t chosen\u2014the chosen women being white women. In Brazil, black and mixed-race women have been traditionally oversexualized or looked upon as domestic servants, while white women are viewed as the perfect women to give affection to and to have a healthy marriage with. It is a given that the more money and education an Afro-Brazilian has, the more likely he will marry a white woman.\n\nTranslating from a YouTube video by anthropologist Ana Cl\u00e1udia Pacheco, a professor at the State University of Bahia:\n\nBecause of historical reasons related to racism, many black women in Brazil suffer from solitude. ... Our choices in who we give affection to and who we choose as a partner are still regulated by and structured by racism and sexism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Afrodengo isn\u2019t just for creating romantic relationships; Afro-Brazilian men and women are using the group to strengthen their black identity and create friendships with Afro-Brazilians across Brazil. Says early adopter Gabriel Rangel, 25, from Rio de Janeiro:\n\nI still haven\u2019t found a relationship through Afrodengo, but now I have friends all over the country, and the group has really opened my mind to the Black Movement in Brazil.\n\nMember Lais Mello entered the group one week after it launched. Adopted by a white family, she\u2019d lacked a strong connection to Afro-Brazilian culture. She created the first city-specific WhatsApp group for Afrodengo, which helped her organize meetups in Salvador and make friends with Afro-Brazilians close to her town in Bahia. Now Mello is a moderator of the group, and credits Afrodengo with increasing her self-esteem and pulling her out of depression:\n\nBefore Afrodengo, I wouldn\u2019t leave the house because of my depression and anxiety. My self-esteem was so low. But now I love going to Afrodengo meetups.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf\u00e9 has grand plans for the Afrodengo brand. The first thing she wants to do is get off of Facebook and create an app for the group. She\u2019s currently looking for funding and support, and plans to apply to the Vale de Dend\u00ea accelerator, which is targeting Afro-Brazilian startups based in Salvador.", "keywords": ["afrobrazilian", "relationships", "afrobrazilians", "afrodengo", "love", "style", "group", "white", "making", "women", "black", "brazil", "if\u00e9", "easier"], "polarity": 0.10571208112874778, "subjectivity": 0.43239417989417983},

It wasn\u2019t until I was 30 years old and I had already experienced so much racism, read tons of books and looked at myself within, that I finally recognized myself as a black woman,\u201d said Almeida, who is a hairstylist.\n\nAnd Almeida wanted to communicate her identity to the world.\n\n\u201cWhen I started to see myself as a black woman, I started looking for aesthetic elements that helped me to form this identity,\u201d she said.\n\nShe discovered turbantes, \u201chead wraps\u201d in Portuguese, and for the last few years she has been wearing turbantes to complement her hair and ethnicity.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Brazil, wearing head wraps is an expression of Afro-Brazilian culture, history and religion. Enslaved Africans brought the tradition from their homelands, and enslaved Afro-Brazilian women continued the tradition by using turbantes during their religious practices or simply to protect their hair. Today, young Afro-Brazilian women are embracing turbantes as an opportunity to assert their blackness in a country where white supremacy rules.\n\nTha\u00eds Muniz, a native of Salvador, Brazil, teaches Afro-Brazilian women how to wear turbantes through her company and brand Turbante.se, which means to \u201chead wrap yourself.\u201d But her lessons aren\u2019t limited to the aesthetics of head wraps. She also focuses on the unique history and politics of head wraps in Brazil, a country where more than 50 percent of the population identifies as black.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen I first started researching head wraps years ago, I couldn\u2019t find anything on the internet about Afro-Brazilian women,\u201d said Muniz, who is based in Dublin but is from Salvador, Brazil.\n\nNow she travels across Brazil doing turbante workshops, showing young Afro-Brazilian women how to wear turbantes. Her Instagram and Facebook accounts have more than 60,000 followers combined.\n\n\u201cRight now, young black women in Brazil aren\u2019t wearing turbantes for religious purposes or just aesthetic purposes,\u201d Muniz said at a recent workshop in Rio de Janeiro. \u201cIt\u2019s an act of resistance. It\u2019s a new symbol that we have created of our roots.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe use of turbantes by Afro-Brazilian women goes back to the era of slavery. According to Muniz, the Yoruba people from what is now modern-day Nigeria and Benin were some of the last Africans to be brought to Brazil. Their Yoruba religion led to the creation of the Afro-Brazilians\u2019 Candombl\u00e9 religion, in which women and men wear turbantes on their heads as a form of protection.\n\nOutside of religion, while white women often wore jeweled hats, enslaved black women all over Brazil wore turbantes to carry heavy baskets on their heads and cover their short hair or shaved heads. Eventually, their use as a fashion accessory in the public declined\u2014black women only wore them while cleaning. The turbante became identified with Baianas de Acarajae, women in Salvador who sell acarajae and sweets on the streets, wearing the clothes they would wear to a Candombl\u00e9 ceremony\u2014a white robe and turbante and, sometimes, jewelry. Carmen Miranda, a white Brazilian woman of Portuguese origins, popularized the style of these black women in the 1940s with the song \u201cO que \u00e9 que tem a Baiana tem\u201d (\u201cWhat Does the Baiana Have?\u201d).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPeople look at me and say that I look like Carmen Miranda, which is insulting,\u201d Muniz said. \u201cWhy would someone look at a black woman and associate her with a white woman who romanticized the situation of black women who were enslaved, exploited and sexually abused?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe contemporary valorization of turbantes as a political statement has its roots in Salvador, the blackest city in Brazil. In the \u201970s, Salvador\u2019s Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea carnival group took the turbante in a direction Brazilians had never seen before: The Afro Bloco, created in response to the exclusion of blacks in Salvador\u2019s carnival, combined black pride with fashion, with the turbante as the centerpiece.\n\nDete Lima, one of the female founders of the Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea group, created the signature look of Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea and continues to work as a stylist for the group. As she told a Brazilian newspaper (translated from Portuguese):\n\n\n\nI learned when I was a child to be conscious that I am black and I have to do my part as a militant and uplift my people, my roots and everything related to my history. We are black and we are beautiful ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer contemporary Negra Jh\u00f4 was one of the first black women to wear turbantes in the streets of Salvador back in the \u201970s. From there, she started teaching people how to create elaborate turbantes and hairstyles using braids. Negra Jh\u00f4\u2019s beauty salon in the center of Salvador is an aesthetic reference for Afro-Brazilian women across the country.\n\nAfro-Brazilian women aren\u2019t the only ones embracing turbantes. Their white Brazilian counterparts are, too\u2014and it\u2019s not being received well. In the last few years, Brazilian media and fashion have taken to featuring white women in turbantes, diluting the political statement in favor of a fashion statement. Last year, a white cancer survivor admitted on Facebook that she was being criticized by black women for wearing turbantes. The post was shared more than 38,000 times and sparked the hashtag #VaiTerBrancaDeTurbanteSim, which translates to, \u201cYes, white people will wear head wraps.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Afro-Brazilian women, this is a form of cultural appropriation. When black women wear turbantes, they are often discriminated against in stores, on the streets, even at university. Shortly after the #VaiTerBrancaDeTurbanteSim hashtag took off, Dandara Tonantzin Castro suffered harassment from several men when she wore her turbante at a university graduation. In a Facebook post titled \u201cOur Presence Makes Them Uncomfortable,\u201d Castro described how a young man pulled at her turbante.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Thais Muniz, rather than restrict white people from wearing turbantes, it\u2019s more important that people understand the history and meaning of turbantes for Afro-Brazilians. But as she told The Glow Up, she understands the discrepancy in the respect that white women receive when they wear turbantes: \u201cWhenever you have a white body dressed in a turbante alongside a black body, the white person will always be the one valued more.\u201d", "keywords": ["afrobrazilian", "brazilian", "deeply", "head", "political", "history", "white", "wear", "women", "brazil", "black", "turbantes", "fashion", "turbante", "woman", "reemergence", "statement"], "polarity": 0.03785922912428938, "subjectivity": 0.34405935430031837},

Like a mother preparing her home for 500,000 tourists, Rio has swept the city's poverty under the rug by increasing police and army presence in favelas. As a result, part of the local population isn\u2019t that anxious about the games. Militarized police presence and violence are only some of the issues that have affected the Afro-Brazilian population living in Rio since the possibility of sports mega events such as the World Cup in 2014, and now the Olympic Games, became a reality in Brazil.\n\n\"Urban segregation in Rio de Janeiro was aggravated with the preparation to receive the sports mega events,\" anthropologist Luciane O. Rocha, a researcher at the Nucleo de Estudos da Cidadania Conflito e Viol\u00eancia Urbana of the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, told The Root. \"While the investments in housing and the majority of the spatial structure for the games were constructed in privileged areas, to the poorest areas were destined only violent actions from the policy and the army.\"\n\nSince 2014, the black population of Rio has complained that the government has been increasing police presence in favela communities, which aggravates an already problematic issue of violence between the poor and the police. Also, in 2014, Rio de Janeiro\u2019s former governor Sergio Cabral requested the presence of military forces in the state to help pacify favela communities. More than 20,000 military officers are reported to be part of the security force for the Olympics. But it isn't just the increased police presence that has many concerned; racial profiling of poor black youths inside the public transportation has also increased, and some have reportedly been denied access to wealthy neighborhoods close to beach areas.\n\nIn August 2015, Secretariat of Security Jos\u00e9 Mariano Beltrame decided to control gang-related robberies in beach areas by requesting that the military police approach poor black youths and demand to see their documents, even removing them from buses while they were trying to go to the beach.\n\n\u201cThe media put the population against the youth that only wanted go to the beach, when we had almost 90-degree [days],\" actor and journalist Ernesto Xavier said. \"They were arresting the minors and left them [the] whole day in a police station with no food or water, releasing them only at the end of the day.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs tension grew between the poor and the police, the number of black deaths increased. In 2015 more than 480 black men were killed by the police in Rio. One of the victims of the over-policing of favelas was 30-year-old Vitor Santiago. On Feb. 11, 2015, Santiago and some friends were returning to the Complexo da Mar\u00e9, a group of favela communities in Rio's north side, after watching a soccer team play when the army, which was patrolling the area, reportedly opened fire on the car they were riding in. The car was hit with 762 bullets.\n\nSantiago would suffer a punctured lung and have his leg amputated. The damage done to his bone marrow after the shooting rendered Santiago a paraplegic.\n\n\"I have a lot of needs; I can\u2019t work anymore because someone needs to take care of my son,\" Santiago's mother, Irone Santiago, said. \"Everything the government promised to me didn\u2019t work. I don\u2019t have home care, the diapers that my son is using were a donation from people in the community. I\u2019m still waiting on a neurosurgeon to evaluate my son.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIrone Santiago claims that the government called the shooting a \"mistake\" and notes that she has yet to receive any financial support from the state, the federal government or the army.\n\nFor many black residents like VItor Santiago, Brazil's Olympic legacy will be more about violence and exclusion, since the games don't feel welcoming to those who live in the poor parts of the city.\n\n\"Olympics for whom?\" Irone Santiago asks. \"These games are made with the blood of our sons.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDaniela Gomes, who is from Sao Paulo, is a Ph.D. candidate in African and African Diaspora studies at the University of Texas at Austin and a journalist.

At last night\u2019s Academy Awards, she certainly lived up to the moniker, putting her own slightly gothic spin on the goddess-inspired trend that threatened to take over the red carpet.\n\nWearing a sleek bob styled by Tymothe Wallace and a Vera Wang couture gown chosen by stylist Jason Bolden (who also dressed Ava DuVernay this Oscar weekend), the actress showed off her famously toned body with yards of chiffon, sheer paneling and an up-to-there slit, flashing us a gleaming length of leg throughout the evening\u2019s festivities.\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images)\n\nAnd because we never tire of an epic slay here at The Glow Up, when we heard that Henson\u2019s longtime makeup artist Ashunta Sheriff was dishing on the star\u2019s look last night, we naturally wanted the goods. I mean ... who wouldn\u2019t?\n\nFun fact: As both a model and, later, a first-time Grammy nominee, I was blessed to have my face polished to perfection by Ashunta Sheriff. I can personally attest that she is a master of her craft, and a makeup maven who makes contouring a breeze with the first-ever dual-ended foundation stick from her collection, Ashunta Sheriff Beauty. She\u2019s also generous enough to share her expertise: Time spent in her chair is as educational as it is beautifying!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images)\n\nOn that note, here\u2019s our favorite secret to how Sheriff created Henson\u2019s Oscar slay: Several components can be found right in your local drusgtore aisle. For instance, like Issa Rae\u2019s Golden Globes makeup artist, Joanna Simkin, Sheriff looked no further than a reliable household name to make sure Henson\u2019s skin took center stage last night. As she shared with The Glow Up:\n\n1. \u201cBecause Taraji\u2019s dress was Grecian and flowy and showed lots of skin, I wanted to make sure she was glowing and moisturized from head to toe! I used Vaseline Intensive Care Cocoa Radiant Lotion, made with deep healing moisturizers and Vaseline jelly; it was the perfect choice to show off her healthy, luminous skin.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. \u201cTo start off her makeup, I used Fenty Beauty by Rihanna Pro Filt\u2019r Instant Retouch Primer. Then Perfect Blend by Ashunta Sheriff, a dual-ended foundation and concealer that helps you get even in one step. Perfect Blend is the first dual-ended foundation and helps to tone down redness. The formula feels lightweight and wears like a second skin, giving you medium to buildable coverage. I used the shade medium for a natural soft coverage.\n\n\n\n3. \u201cFor Taraji\u2019s already amazing cheekbones, I used my fingertips for a softening effect to highlight, using Danessa Myricks Enlight Illuminator powder in Confidence. Its super-pigmented shimmer is my favorite. I contoured using Cozette S145 Perfect Contour brush and Cozette Infinite Contour Palette to sculpt cheekbones.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. \u201cFor the eyes, I used Kiss Beauty Blowout Lashes in Pixie. These lashes are perfect for sexy and soft looks; plus, Kiss makes affordable lashes that are comparable to high-end brands. I placed lashes close to Taraji\u2019s lash line, then created a thin line using Kiss Waterproof Wonders precision-point eye liner to create definition. I always marry faux lashes and real lashes with Kiss Mascara in Black.\n\n\n\n5. \u201cLastly, I finished the look off with lip liner in MAC Cork and filled in her lips as well, for longevity\u2014layering ensures the color lasts longer. To finish the lip, I applied the Lip Bar Liquid Matte Creme in Savage and Drama Queen.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAshunta Sheriff and Taraji P.

Henson, who reportedly dropped him as a manager over the weekend, issued a statement saying he was out of the game.\n\n\u201cIt is with incredibly great sadness that at this time, I believe it\u2019s in the best interests of all my actors and actresses that I represent to close my management company. This business is hard enough and I don\u2019t want to distract in any way from their careers or opportunities in the entertainment field. I wish all the people I represent the very best in all their future endeavors,\u201d Cirrincione said a statement to Deadline.\n\nBerry had reportedly dropped Cirrincione some years back over allegations that he used her name to come on to up-and-coming actresses.\n\nEarlier:\n\n\n\nA prominent manager of African-American talent that once included Halle Berry and currently includes Taraji P. Henson is the latest man in Hollywood to be accused of sexual harassment. This time, nine women of color\u2014eight black, one Asian\u2014have accused Vincent Cirrincione of unwanted sexual advances (and, of course, public masturbation) over a period beginning in 1993 and ending in 2011.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Washington Post broke the story Friday. Cirrincione allegedly used his prominence to \u201cprey upon young women of color seeking an entry into Hollywood,\u201d according to the report.\n\nThe first woman cited in the article, Tamika Lamison, says that she was 27 years old when she was at Cirrincione\u2019s hotel room for an impromptu audition after the Tony Awards when Berry called. Cirrincione put the star on speaker. The Post reports:\n\nWhen the call ended, Lamison began reciting a poem she had written. Midway through her performance, she said Cirrincione grabbed her and started kissing her, sticking his tongue in her mouth. She said he told her that he could take her on as a client, on the condition that he would get to see her for sex whenever he wanted. She said she pushed him away and left.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf the nine women, three say that Cirrincione pushed for sex as a condition of representing them, and that he did not take them on when they refused. A fourth said that he offered to help advance her career if she agreed to have sex with him monthly. A fifth actress said that he masturbated in front of her in his office during the years he managed her.\n\nBerry reportedly cut ties with Cirrincione three years ago after hearing about the allegations against him.\n\n\n\n\u201cOver three years ago, a woman was on the radio saying that Halle Berry\u2019s manager was her worst casting couch experience ever. That news literally stopped me in my tracks. I immediately confronted Vince about it, and he denied it completely. But even with his denial, something didn\u2019t feel right in my spirit, and with the possibility that it could be true, I immediately ended our over-25-year relationship,\u201d she told the Post.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Post reports that Cirrincione and Berry co-produced Introducing Dorothy Dandridge for HBO in 1999.\n\nOn Friday, Berry spoke out again on Instagram, saying she\u2019s \u201clivid that [Cirrincione] used me.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBerry said that the manager had never made an inappropriate gesture toward her.\n\n\n\nHenson, who has been managed by Cirrincione for two decades, said that she never heard of or witnessed any inappropriate behavior by Cirrincione toward women.\n\nIn fact, she says, he really helped her when she was struggling.\n\n\u201cHe saw a single mother trying to make her dreams come true, and he nurtured that,\u201d Henson told the Post. \u201cHe wrote checks and wouldn\u2019t ask for anything in return. It wasn\u2019t coming from a creepy place. If anything, it empowered me. Like, this man believes in me. I love him for that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs with Berry, Cirrincione has also been Henson\u2019s producing partner; Henson\u2019s publicist, Pam Sharp, is Cirrincione\u2019s longtime girlfriend, according to the Post.\n\nIn a statement, Cirrincione responded to the criticisms:\n\nWe live in a time where men are being confronted with a very real opportunity to take responsibility for their actions. I support this movement wholeheartedly. I have had female clients and employees my entire career in this industry. I have built a reputation for advancing the careers of women of color. I have had affairs while in committed relationships, ones I am now ashamed to say are coming to light and shading my past and my reputation. I can say without a doubt that I have never used favors, sexual or otherwise, as a reason for managing anyone. I want to make it clear that not one of those relationships were anything but consensual. I take responsibility for my part in the situation and I am not here to diminish anyone\u2019s feelings or experiences. I apologize to these women, my past and present partner, my clients and employees for the pain this is bringing them. I was under the impression I was living my life as a supportive man to women. It is with a heavy heart that I see now I was wrong.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNone of the nine women make accusations of rape or criminal misconduct. Only three have used their names publicly because they say they feared (and still fear) repercussions.\n\n", "keywords": ["sexual", "say", "cirrincione", "reportedly", "manager", "told", "post", "allegations", "amid", "harassment", "berry", "vincent", "used", "blackadjacent", "women", "shuts", "agency", "hollywood"], "polarity": 0.10151600033952973, "subjectivity": 0.4795098039215686},

Appearing for her third supporting actress nod for eventual best picture winner The Shape of Water, the actress and children\u2019s-book author was styled by sister team Wendi and Nicole in an ethereal green gown that evoked the flowing depths of the sea.\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images)\n\nAs we\u2019ve learned from several female celebs who don\u2019t fit the typical Hollywood starlet mold\u2014including being over 40 and not a sample size\u2014it can sometimes be a struggle to find red-carpet-worthy gowns. Christian Siriano and Tadashi Shoji have both become reliable industry sources for all-inclusive glamour, but Spencer nailed her look Sunday night courtesy of one of our fashion faves, Brandon Maxwell (who also dressed best actress winner Alison Janney and our hilarious homegirl Tiffany Haddish for the Vanity Fair after-party Sunday night). In a lovely Instagram post, Maxwell wrote:\n\nI am very proud, with my team, to have dressed Best Supporting Actress nominee @octaviaspencer in a custom emerald green satin faced organza gown for Tonight\u2019s 90th Annual Academy Awards. Octavia makes history tonight with her third nomination, and we are beyond honored to be a part of her special moment.\n\nWhat we loved about this dress is how well the belted silhouette and full, flowing skirt highlighted Spencer\u2019s curvy figure, as well as the deep emerald green, which played to perfection against her brown skin\u2014which we were thrilled to see more of on display. But our favorite aspect by far was the off-the-shoulder neckline, which framed her beautiful face and shoulders, which were grazed by a wavy bob, styled by celebrity hairstylist and groomer David Stanwell.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStanwell began working with Spencer five years ago while at the Cannes Film Festival to promote Fruitvale Station. He says he hit it off with the acclaimed actress the moment they met, telling The Glow Up: \u201cShe has a great sense of humor, and we always have a fun time together. She is professional, and all those elements make for a good work environment.\u201d\n\nThis awards season, Spencer\u2019s hair\u2014which Stanwell tells us is naturally curly and pressed out\u2014has consistently looked stunning, with the actress frequently rocking loose waves to accent her array of red-carpet looks. Stanwell tells us:\n\nOctavia loves curls in the hair\u2014big, medium, and sometimes smaller! We always opt for curls going away from [the] face, and we alternate the tightness depending upon the size of the curling iron. The only time we don\u2019t curl is if we do a slicked-back look with a bun or ponytail. As most award shows are long, we like to stick to simple and practical looks, yet still with a glamorous edge without being too fussy. Our influence always comes from classic and elegant so we always end up in that wheelhouse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Tristan Fewings (Getty Images)\n\nWhile Stanwell is always willing to gently push his star client to try something new and different, he\u2019s also very respectful of her comfort zone and happiness on the red carpet. But when Stanwell saw a sketch of Spencer\u2019s 2018 Oscar gown, he was inspired to take her look shorter to keep the shoulders bare, telling us:\n\nOctavia had sent me the sketch of her dress [last] week, which helped spark my inspiration for [Sunday night\u2019s] look. Instantly, I knew I wanted to do a side part, so that one side was off the shoulder to compliment her dress and jewelry. Octavia liked the idea of a curl, but not too brushed out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStanwell says his secret to keeping Spencer\u2019s hair looking glamorous and healthy is simpler\u2014and far less expensive\u2014than one might think. For Spencer, he\u2019s been relying on a variety of Dove hair products, which, in his words, \u201c[have] helped with that shine and healthy glow that we all want for our hair.\u201d\n\nWe were curious, so he graciously gave The Glow Up a how-to on Spencer\u2019s wavy Oscars bob:\n\n\u201cI started prepping the hair by mixing Dove Style + Care Smooth & Shine Heat Protection Spray and a dollop of Dove Absolute Curls Supreme Cr\u00e8me Serum together to moisturize her hair before applying any heat.\n\n\u201cUsing a large, round brush, I blow-dried her hair to create the desired face-framing shape. We decided on taking the hair shorter [for the night], so after I blow-dried it, I made a deep side part to add more definition to the look.\n\n\u201cAfter I finished blow-drying the hair, I went through it with a 1-inch curling iron to create glamorous, defined waves by twisting the hair toward her face.\n\n\u201cWhile the hair was cooling, I sprayed Dove Style + Care Compressed Micro Mist Flexible Hold Hairspray to give it that extra hold before running my hands through to break up the curls. [Pro tip: Waiting until the hair is cool enough to run one\u2019s fingers through it gives it a fabulous curl that will last all night long.]\n\n\u201cAfter shaping the hair and dressing it around her face, I tucked the curls on the right side of her face behind her ear to give it a romantic feel and show off her jewelry. To finish, I sprayed Dove Style + Care Compressed Micro Mist Flexible Hold Hairspray again throughout the hair to give it a boost of shine.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe have to give credit to Stanwell and Spencer\u2019s entire glam squad for giving one of our screen queens the Cinderella moment she so richly deserved. It\u2019s always exciting to see a star\u2019s style evolve, and while Spencer isn\u2019t known for glamorous roles, we\u2019re hoping to see these gorgeous, age-appropriate (and subtly sexy!) red-carpet moments continue for her.

Henson is a stellar actress, but sadly, most people recognize her from Empire. Maybe they were under rocks for The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Hustle & Flow, Hidden Figures, Baby Boy or any of the other silver screen hits in which she\u2019s appeared..\n\nAnd while Henson has made her Empire character, Cookie, into a household name, she wants to be sure that the world knows that as an actress, she has more to offer. And she does!\n\nIn her latest role, in Proud Mary, Henson plays Mary, a bad-ass mother and assassin. She told the Chicago Tribune of her character: \u201cThis woman wants out of a lifestyle that she is sick of. She has a bunch of men telling her she can\u2019t leave; well, guess what? She takes the power back.\u201d\n\nHenson is not a newbie when it comes to strong leading lady roles, but it is the first time we get to see her in action. As the big wheels keep on turnin\u2019 in Hollywood, this \u201cproud Mary\u201d keeps on rollin\u2019 to provide us with refreshing performances in roles that a woman of her caliber deserves.\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ve got to admit, watching a woman \u201cof a certain age and hue\u201d (as Henson says in the video above) play a role like this one is empowering. We haven\u2019t really seen this type of character since the \u201970s, with portrayals like Pam Grier\u2019s Foxy Brown. We see you, Taraji!

Henson. Seriously, the woman so regularly kills it on the red carpet, we\u2019re ready to nickname her Buffy the Couture Slayer. At last night\u2019s Academy Awards, she certainly lived up to the moniker, putting her own slightly gothic spin on the goddess-inspired trend that threatened to take over the red carpet.\n\nWearing a sleek bob styled by Tymothe Wallace and a Vera Wang couture gown chosen by stylist Jason Bolden (who also dressed Ava DuVernay this Oscar weekend), the actress showed off her famously toned body with yards of chiffon, sheer paneling and an up-to-there slit, flashing us a gleaming length of leg throughout the evening\u2019s festivities.\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images)\n\nAnd because we never tire of an epic slay here at The Glow Up, when we heard that Henson\u2019s longtime makeup artist Ashunta Sheriff was dishing on the star\u2019s look last night, we naturally wanted the goods. I mean ... who wouldn\u2019t?\n\nFun fact: As both a model and, later, a first-time Grammy nominee, I was blessed to have my face polished to perfection by Ashunta Sheriff. I can personally attest that she is a master of her craft, and a makeup maven who makes contouring a breeze with the first-ever dual-ended foundation stick from her collection, Ashunta Sheriff Beauty. She\u2019s also generous enough to share her expertise: Time spent in her chair is as educational as it is beautifying!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images)\n\nOn that note, here\u2019s our favorite secret to how Sheriff created Henson\u2019s Oscar slay: Several components can be found right in your local drusgtore aisle. For instance, like Issa Rae\u2019s Golden Globes makeup artist, Joanna Simkin, Sheriff looked no further than a reliable household name to make sure Henson\u2019s skin took center stage last night. As she shared with The Glow Up:\n\n1. \u201cBecause Taraji\u2019s dress was Grecian and flowy and showed lots of skin, I wanted to make sure she was glowing and moisturized from head to toe! I used Vaseline Intensive Care Cocoa Radiant Lotion, made with deep healing moisturizers and Vaseline jelly; it was the perfect choice to show off her healthy, luminous skin.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. \u201cTo start off her makeup, I used Fenty Beauty by Rihanna Pro Filt\u2019r Instant Retouch Primer. Then Perfect Blend by Ashunta Sheriff, a dual-ended foundation and concealer that helps you get even in one step. Perfect Blend is the first dual-ended foundation and helps to tone down redness. The formula feels lightweight and wears like a second skin, giving you medium to buildable coverage. I used the shade medium for a natural soft coverage.\n\n\n\n3. \u201cFor Taraji\u2019s already amazing cheekbones, I used my fingertips for a softening effect to highlight, using Danessa Myricks Enlight Illuminator powder in Confidence. Its super-pigmented shimmer is my favorite. I contoured using Cozette S145 Perfect Contour brush and Cozette Infinite Contour Palette to sculpt cheekbones.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. \u201cFor the eyes, I used Kiss Beauty Blowout Lashes in Pixie. These lashes are perfect for sexy and soft looks; plus, Kiss makes affordable lashes that are comparable to high-end brands. I placed lashes close to Taraji\u2019s lash line, then created a thin line using Kiss Waterproof Wonders precision-point eye liner to create definition. I always marry faux lashes and real lashes with Kiss Mascara in Black.\n\n\n\n5. \u201cLastly, I finished the look off with lip liner in MAC Cork and filled in her lips as well, for longevity\u2014layering ensures the color lasts longer. To finish the lip, I applied the Lip Bar Liquid Matte Creme in Savage and Drama Queen.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAshunta Sheriff and Taraji P. Henson are clearly a match made in makeup heaven\u2014after all, what better color to use on Henson than \u201cDrama Queen\u201d? Henson certainly brought the drama last night, and with a slay game this consistent, we\u2019re not sure which we\u2019re more excited about: the Oscar-nominated actress\u2019s next film, or her next appearance on the red carpet!", "keywords": ["oscars", "slays", "using", "red", "henson", "kiss", "carpetagain", "taraji", "ashunta", "sheriff", "makeup", "tarajis", "perfect", "p", "glow", "lashes", "used"], "polarity": 0.1809403559403559, "subjectivity": 0.46866489991489985},

And how about an \u00fcber-talented hairdresser like Tym Wallace scrutinizing your every move via a super-closeup iPhone app for moviemakers? You would be flawless, that\u2019s what. Don\u2019t take my word for it, though; see for yourself when Proud Mary,\n\nTaraji P. Henson\u2019s latest star vehicle, hits the big screen today, Friday, Jan. 12.\n\nTo celebrate the film\u2019s release\u2014and all things hair\u2014Wallace, along with hair-care brand Creme of Nature, recently hosted a bevy of beauty editors in the penthouse suite of 60 Thompson, a sexy little boutique hotel in New York City\u2019s SoHo neighborhood.\n\nChampagne and high tea were served while Wallace\u2014who had just wrapped a publicity shoot in the adjacent suite of rooms\u2014emerged and took his place at the center of the circle to tell the tale of how he built the hair story for Henson\u2019s titular role as Mary. \u201cNot since Pam Grier have we seen a role like this on film,\u201d he said.\n\nClad in all black, with a razor-sharp brushed fade and a flute of Champagne at the end of his Yakuza sleeve-tattooed arm, he proceeded to hold court with a nod to the current national mood: \u201cIt\u2019s great to see women taking their power back,\u201d declared Wallace as the room raised their glasses in agreement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWallace\u2019s reading of the script for Proud Mary, directed by Babak Najafi, led him to create hairstyles so closely interwoven with the plot that he could scarcely reveal the number of hair changes, for fear of spoiler alerts. Wallace explained, \u201cContract killers move in mystery and in silence\u2014the outside world is not supposed to know the personality of a killer.\u201d\n\nThe role had many challenges: creating a look that was simultaneously fly, incognito and capable of standing up to the physical demands of Henson performing many of her own stunts. Wallace\u2019s tactic was simple: \u201cKeep it minimal,\u201d killing it with a series of high-end human-hair wigs.\n\nTo hold those $575-a-piece human-hair wigs in place during filming, his adhesive of choice was spirit gum, specifically from WM Creations in its matte finish. Wallace, who has been looking after Henson\u2019s tresses since the two met in 2015, does not like using glue for wigs; he feels it damages the hair and doesn\u2019t clean up easily with 99 percent alcohol, the way spirit gum does. He\u2019s a fan of buying French hairpins by the pound to secure wigs and pieces.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo matter what you\u2019re doing with your hair, Wallace maintains that edge care is a major issue\u2014certainly, removing and regluing wigs twice a day takes its toll. His No. 1 weapon in the war on edge erosion is his own \u201cspecial concoction\u201d of oils, including Jamaican black castor, jojoba, tea tree and coconut oils, adding a dash of lavender oil to neutralize the smell of the castor oil.\n\nAs for working with Henson, Wallace says she\u2019s the kind of client \u201cI prayed for. She\u2019s hilarious and she lets me do anything and everything to her hair.\u201d But one thing Wallace won\u2019t do is leave a weave in longer than two months without taking it out for a one-week breather and mandatory maintenance, which always includes trimming split ends. \u201cOne bad petal kills a whole flower; same for split ends in your hair.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe also cautions against braiding hair too tightly, citing an epidemic of traction alopecia he\u2019s been seeing lately, due to braiders who are so deft at their craft they can \u201ccatch and braid your eyebrows!\u201d\u2014a truth that made the room erupt in laughter. But Wallace got serious as he slid his signature glasses down his nose, peering sincerely at the editors gathered: \u201cTell your braider not to touch your edges, and give those braids some slack.\u201d\n\nFor everyday edge care, he advises using edge-taming products that don\u2019t list alcohol as the No. 1 ingredient. He also swears by tinted gels to boost the shine and luster of edges, giving that extra touch of #BlackGirlMagic. According to the Wallace gospel\u2014where hair is a \u201crelatable form of ministry\u201d\u2014tips for maintaining straight hair include using leave-in conditioner and heat-protectant products.\n\nNow in his 12th year as a hairdresser, he\u2019s happy to see that so many women have had a come-to-Jesus moment and joined the natural-hair movement. Says Wallace: \u201cWe have the best hair in the world. It does everything. All we have to do is protect it.\u201d\n\n", "keywords": ["killer", "using", "proud", "role", "tym", "hair", "tarajis", "hes", "secrets", "making", "wallace", "hensons", "edge", "does", "wigs", "world", "stylist", "shares", "mary"], "polarity": 0.24024927142574204, "subjectivity": 0.5239982457629516},

I mean, we know she\u2019s an Oakland, Calif., native, and a child model-turned-Disney starlet. We know she appeared on Dancing With the Stars before scoring the coveted role of M.J. in the latest installment of the Spider-Man franchise. We even know she\u2019s also a singer whose 2014 single \u201cReplay\u201d hit No. 40 on the Billboard charts, and most recently she sang while swinging on a flying trapeze in Hugh Jackman\u2019s latest film, the Oscar-nominated The Greatest Showman.\n\nBut we can\u2019t really pinpoint the moment when she arrived\u2014on our radar, at least. It feels as if we just looked up one day and there she was, stunning and perfectly deserving of the spotlight. All we know is that we\u2019ve had a hard time taking our eyes off of her ever since, because she consistently gets it right on the red carpet.\n\nThe 90th annual Academy Awards ceremony was no exception. The Glow Up Facebook live thread collectively gasped when Zendaya appeared on the step-and-repeat in a one-sleeved, deep-sienna-colored chiffon gown by Giambattista Valli. (Notably, the gown beautifully photographed chocolate brown against the red carpet, then appeared a burnished burgundy against the Oscars stage set, where she was a presenter.) On another star, the voluminous silhouette might have been overwhelming, but at a willowy 5 feet 10 inches, the 21-year-old looked like a true goddess, even as an ingenue among established megastars.\n\nBut everyone knows it takes a village to raise a successful red-carpet look, and Zendaya has found a dream team in stylist Law Roach (who also styled Mary J. Blige for the evening), makeup artist Sheika Daley and hairstylist Ursula Stephen, the mastermind who created many of Rihanna\u2019s most iconic looks.\n\nTo offset the volume of her dress, Stephen chose to keep her starlet\u2019s hair stylish and simple, telling The Glow Up, \u201cZendaya and I went back and forth about her look for tonight\u2019s show, but ultimately landed on a sleek and chic top knot to enhance the elegant silhouette created by her Giambattista Valli dress.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images)\n\nBut pulled-back doesn\u2019t automatically mean easy, especially when you\u2019re creating a style that has to last from the awards ceremony through the after-party. So Stephen\u2014a brand ambassador for Unilever as well as Dyson hair products\u2014gave The Glow Up her step-by-step on how to create the perfect topknot\u2014using her go-to tools and products.

I mean, we know she\u2019s an Oakland, Calif., native, and a child model-turned-Disney starlet. We know she appeared on Dancing With the Stars before scoring the coveted role of M.J. in the latest installment of the Spider-Man franchise. We even know she\u2019s also a singer whose 2014 single \u201cReplay\u201d hit No. 40 on the Billboard charts, and most recently she sang while swinging on a flying trapeze in Hugh Jackman\u2019s latest film, the Oscar-nominated The Greatest Showman.\n\nBut we can\u2019t really pinpoint the moment when she arrived\u2014on our radar, at least. It feels as if we just looked up one day and there she was, stunning and perfectly deserving of the spotlight. All we know is that we\u2019ve had a hard time taking our eyes off of her ever since, because she consistently gets it right on the red carpet.\n\nThe 90th annual Academy Awards ceremony was no exception. The Glow Up Facebook live thread collectively gasped when Zendaya appeared on the step-and-repeat in a one-sleeved, deep-sienna-colored chiffon gown by Giambattista Valli. (Notably, the gown beautifully photographed chocolate brown against the red carpet, then appeared a burnished burgundy against the Oscars stage set, where she was a presenter.) On another star, the voluminous silhouette might have been overwhelming, but at a willowy 5 feet 10 inches, the 21-year-old looked like a true goddess, even as an ingenue among established megastars.\n\nBut everyone knows it takes a village to raise a successful red-carpet look, and Zendaya has found a dream team in stylist Law Roach (who also styled Mary J. Blige for the evening), makeup artist Sheika Daley and hairstylist Ursula Stephen, the mastermind who created many of Rihanna\u2019s most iconic looks.\n\nTo offset the volume of her dress, Stephen chose to keep her starlet\u2019s hair stylish and simple, telling The Glow Up, \u201cZendaya and I went back and forth about her look for tonight\u2019s show, but ultimately landed on a sleek and chic top knot to enhance the elegant silhouette created by her Giambattista Valli dress.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images)\n\nBut pulled-back doesn\u2019t automatically mean easy, especially when you\u2019re creating a style that has to last from the awards ceremony through the after-party. So Stephen\u2014a brand ambassador for Unilever as well as Dyson hair products\u2014gave The Glow Up her step-by-step on how to create the perfect topknot\u2014using her go-to tools and products.

Blige will attend the 90th Academy Awards not as a guest, presenter or simply a performer, but as a dual nominee for best supporting actress and best original song for Dee Rees\u2019 gripping post-World War II drama, Mudbound. It\u2019s a remarkable first-time feat for a first-time nominee; no other person has ever been nominated in an acting and song category for the same film.\n\nIn Mudbound, Blige plays Florence Jackson, the beleaguered but noble matriarch of a sharecropping family in rural Mississippi. Her stillness often anchors the film, riveting your attention to her every time she is on-screen. In the months since the film\u2019s release and growing Oscar buzz, Blige has spoken frequently about harnessing the power of her sadness from her ongoing divorce from former manager Kendu Isaacs for the role, as well as stripping down to play Florence Jackson. From Vulture:\n\nI\u2019m Mary J. Blige. I mean, like, this is what I do. I wear wigs, I wear bob wigs, and I had to completely strip down to my own natural hair texture, which I\u2019ve always been afraid of. Dee stripped me down all the way to what I truly am, and people were complimenting me. People were saying how beautiful I was. I didn\u2019t know I was that beautiful for real. You understand what I\u2019m saying? I didn\u2019t know that.\n\nTwo-time Emmy Award-winning hairstylist Lawrence Davis was instrumental in that transformational \u201cmakeunder,\u201d using both his extensive historical knowledge and incredible skill to render the Queen of Hip-Hop Soul almost unrecognizable to audiences at last year\u2019s Sundance Film Festival, where Mudbound premiered. Said director Rees: \u201cThe great surprise at Sundance was that people didn\u2019t know it was her until the credits rolled.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Derek Blanks\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIntrigued by the power of Blige\u2019s natural beauty, The Glow Up had the opportunity to talk with Davis about stripping down a megastar like Mary J. Blige, whom he describes as \u201cone of the shyest women on earth ... and so super-sweet.\u201d He tells us:\n\nI remember Mary\u2019s first day coming in for a camera test; I had specific directions from Dee Rees about how she wanted Mary just to strip down. She\u2019s like, \u201cI don\u2019t want wigs, I don\u2019t want this, I don\u2019t want that; I want it all organic.\u201d I said, \u201cYou got it.\u201d So Mary came in the trailer, and she sat in my chair, and we talked a little bit, as I was like, \u201cWell, I just need to get you to trust the process. Trust me to take you where you want to go, and if anything feels uncomfortable, we\u2019ll talk through it. So I [asked], \u2018Are you ready?\u2019 She\u2019s like, \u2018I\u2019m not taking my wig off in front of all these people!\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavis accommodated, clearing out the hair and makeup trailer to unmask the artist as well known for her assortment of blond coifs, lengthy manicures and thigh-high boots as for her hit-making urban ballads and bangers. Of course, Blige tried to negotiate her way into wearing a natural wig to play a sharecropper\u2019s wife, but Davis remained firm:\n\n\u201c\u2018No ... Dee wants you. She wants you to strip down,\u2019\u201d he told Blige. \u201c\u2018She don\u2019t want to see Mary; she wants to see Florence Jackson walk in there for this camera test.\u2019\u201d\n\nDavis ultimately won her trust, peeling back both wig and tracks of weave to reveal Blige\u2019s natural hair. Throughout Mudbound, audiences are seeing Blige\u2019s natural texture at work in creating humble updos and a single scene in which we see her shoulder-length hair hang free. While the star was leery at first, she soon succumbed to the process\u2014and the freedom that came from releasing the trappings of being Mary J. Blige. Says Davis:\n\nShe basically let herself go, and she became Florence right there in that trailer. And with that, it was just taking any hair she had on her head out\u2014no hair, no weave, no wig\u2014taking her nails off, her lashes off. Basically, you got organic Mary. And I would say about the second, third day, Mary was coming in the trailer full-on Afro, just totally free ... [A]nd I could definitely see that she had this freedom that she did not have day one from that point on. And with that, it just took me saying, \u201cYou\u2019re Florence Jackson.\u201d I said, \u201cFlorence, she\u2019s a woman\u2014she lives on a farm, but she takes care of herself. She washes her clothes, she washes her kids\u2019 clothes. She does the best with what she has; she\u2019s a groomed woman. She lives on a farm in the South in the \u201940s. But she takes care of herself and her family.\u201d And that\u2019s who Mary became; she became Florence Jackson.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMary J.

Blige and director Dee Rees working on Mudbound (Netflix) 1 / 8\n\nAs for the personal woes that Blige was admittedly experiencing during filming, Davis says he was unaware of the specifics at the time, but definitely noticed the emotional transformation that took place:\n\n[T]here were times when I could feel the heaviness\u2014but didn\u2019t know what it was. But I will say that I literally saw that heaviness go away as she got into this character, and she came in there every day and became Florence Jackson. She started talking more, and that heaviness that was there, it disappeared during this movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs lead hairstylist on Mudbound, Davis was entirely in his element. The Baltimore native has a specific affinity for period hairstyles and has previously flexed his knowledge and skills behind the scenes of era-specific projects like The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, Bessie and Hairspray Live!\u2014for which he won the second of his two Emmys.\n\nDavis got his start in his native city, owning his own salon before making the brave choice to sell it and move to Los Angeles in 2001. Halle Berry\u2019s then-stylist Neeko Abriol gave Davis a shot in his salon, and doors immediately began to open. He has since garnered 81 film and television credits, in addition to leading the hair teams of Being Mary Jane, Greenleaf and Claws. But it is the period pieces that remain his true passion. Case in point: His current project is styling Mahershala Ali into virtuoso pianist Don Shirley for the upcoming film Green Book. As Davis tells The Glow Up:\n\nI honestly feel like I\u2019ve been reincarnated, because as long as I remember\u2014even from being a young kid\u2014I gravitated toward anything that was vintage. Vintage cars, vintage clothing; I loved thrift stores because of the vintage clothing. And when I first got a call to do a period piece, I was most excited because it got to the root of what I wanted to do. You know, hairstyling is great, and I love it. But there\u2019s something that I\u2019m drawn to when it comes to period styling. I love the authenticity of it, and how it brings forth the story and tells the story without there even being any verbiage. You can look at the person and see where they\u2019re from, or what\u2019s going on with them because of maybe the economic setting, but just the style that they\u2019re adorned with\u2014the beautiful hair, the beautiful clothes, the beautiful makeup\u2014all of that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Derek Blanks\n\nBut, specifically, Davis loves working with the natural textures of black hair, and is emphatic that it be portrayed accurately on-screen. For him, there is an eternal elegance to natural hair. He believes that natural hairstyles belong in every film and on every red carpet because they are part of our legacy of style:\n\nBlack women, even before they started pressing their hair, they basically knew how to create these wonderful shapes out of natural hair; these silhouettes and things like that that speak elegance and class without pressing it out and going bone straight and having it go silky and shiny. It just was a beautiful, beautiful thing to see. ... But we definitely have the most beautiful hair to me on earth. And you know we wear it well, and I think that in any period movie\u2014no matter what period it is\u2014I think there always should be a black woman with natural hair. ... I just feel like black hair\u2014natural hair\u2014should always be a part of it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut if Davis is excited about the resurgence of natural hair on-screen and on the red carpet alike, he also loves that even black women who wear wigs are gravitating toward styles with more texture in them (e.g., Viola Davis\u2019 incredible Golden Globes look this year). He predicts that at the Oscars this Sunday and many to come, we may bring even more natural styles and braided updos to the step-and-repeat, and tells us:\n\nI think women are much more open to showing exactly, you know, what\u2019s under that wig as opposed to covering up nowadays. And I look at every award show and I always see somebody come forth and say, \u201cNo, this is who I am, and this is who I have been and I want to show it.\u201d ... I think that even when other races look at us and see us out there in our natural form, they love it, because it tells them how proud we are as a people and how proud we are to show what\u2019s natural about us, and what\u2019s unique about us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly how Davis thinks it should be. For him, natural hair has always been far more than just a trend or a movement: \u201cJust call it us. ... I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a movement anymore; I just think it is reality. It\u2019s who we are, and we\u2019re proud of it.\u201d", "keywords": ["mudbound", "natural", "florence", "hair", "hiphop", "netflix", "davis", "soul", "unmaking", "lawrence", "j", "blige", "mary", "talks", "beautiful", "hairstylist", "queen"], "polarity": 0.2369808449695669, "subjectivity": 0.49995972073039713},

Blige was the first person in Oscars history to be nominated for both an acting award and for best original song for the same film (and performed!). Jordan Peele became the first black person to score a win for best original screenplay. And in a surprise plot twist, Kobe Bryant is now also the first NBA player to score an Oscar win.\n\nAnd while we still have a long way to go in terms of representation (and after the success of Black Panther, we are anxious to see what next year\u2019s Oscars might bring), this year\u2019s ceremony was nevertheless filled with refreshing moments.\n\nOur favorite?

Seriously, reflect for uno momento about the sheer number of pop culture, hm, things that the original brought into our lives:\n\nUnstable creatures. \u201cFuck yo\u2019 fort.\u201d The hood nigga (and wrong) explanation of the the macroeconomic GDP model of guns versus butter. \u201cLet me smell your dick.\u201d Omar Gooding, of Hanging With Mr. Cooper fame being a hard-core LA gangster nigga. Dr. Frances Cress-Welsing theories espoused while Tyrese is in a makeshift womb, fully grown. The beat it up good dance. Taraji P. Henson in full DC-accent being a chick from Los Angeles. \u201cI make love to you, I want to be with you, but I fuck other females occasionally.\u201d \u201cJesus be like: turn yo\u2019 ass around nigga.\u201d Melvin schooling Jody about the Oedipus Complex that he has. Melvin cooking breakfast in the buff. Melvin frog-fucking Jody\u2019s mama. Sweet Pea (Omar Gooding) schooling Jody on the proper way to knock a nigga out with the patented One Hitta Quitta. \u201cI tell those other hoes the truth, I lie to you because I care about your feelings.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou get the picture. Pun. And that\u2019s not even an exhaustive list! Baby Boy wasn\u2019t just a movie, it was a beacon of Blackness and what love can look like - even if ridiculous - in the hood. If we got even one third of the shenanigans in a new movie, it would pay for itself. Well, Tyrese is either trolling those of us who like good things or there is a God. Tyrese aka Black Ty aka The Professional Misspeller aka The Syntax Slaughterer teased the potential for a Baby Boy 2: Coming of Age movie by posting on IG (and then deleting) what looks to be a mockup movie poster.\n\nIn an odd twist, however, Snoop Dogg, who played Yvette\u2019s gangbanger, prison homie, ex-boyfriend Rodney in the original, is on the poster. This makes no sense since His-Name-Is-Not-Walter Rodney caught quite a few hot ones at the hands of Sweet Pea because Jody couldn\u2019t pull the trigger. Sweet Pea tho? Yeah, he did that. He did it like he was doing it for television. Straight west coast style with good form and everything. Point is, I don\u2019t know if Snoop would be in the movie as a ghost or some shit but I mean, who knows? Ya know?\n\nLong story short, I don\u2019t know about you, but the potential of a sequel to what I believe is one of the best Black movies ever made - and I\u2019m dead serious when I say that - has got me thinking about some long-standing questions I've had about their lives since the original that I'd hope might be addressed in the sequel. Such as? Such as:\n\n1. WTF?\n\nNigga, why? Why are we even GETTING a sequel. Sure, I\u2019m here for it, but I still would like to know why for come this is a thing. It\u2019s only right to ask that. I don\u2019t even care if it\u2019s a good answer. Every movie doesn\u2019t need a sequel. That is a fact. Like, I went to see Best Man Holiday but did it really need a sequel? Not at all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Did Jody and Yvette\u2019s son ever build a fort again?\n\nWhen Snoop came through and crushed the buildings on the little homey, I felt really bad for him. Mostly because he\u2019s a little kid and getting his fort destroyed might have ruined his esteem for life. What if every time he sees forts he just starts crying. PLUS that nigga Rodney, at some point, never showed up again. MORE PLUS, when Rodney DID show up the first time he just moved into Yvette\u2019s place all willy nilly and was left home with her son, which, let\u2019s be real, is TERRIBLE parenting. I\u2019m just saying, I hope he built another fort.\n\n3. Did Melvin go back to jail?\n\nMy bet is yes. He had two strikes, if you\u2019ll remember. I ain\u2019t saying Melvin was a terrible person, but he had kids he wasn\u2019t taking care of \u201cbecause of their mamas,\u201d etc. It\u2019s entirely believable that the dude who put Jody through a table could end up losing his temper again and ending up back in jail. Just sayin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Did Sweet Pea become a preacher?\n\nHe had all the makings of a reformed thug turned preacherman who opens a storefront and cops some Malcolm X glasses and goes full zealot on anybody who will listen. He\u2019s like the corny version of DMX\u2019s charater in Belly.\n\n5. How many more kids do Jody and Yvette have?\n\nThey already have three (their son and the one on the way, plus his kid with Peanut) when the movie ends, but you know niggas in the hood do not believe in vasectomies and they didn\u2019t seem to believe in condoms. My money is on two more at least. And because I\u2019m a betting man, I\u2019d wager on him having another outside kid.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6.What does their marriage look like?\n\nIt\u2019s implied at the end that Jody had some growing up moments. Yeah, okay. Poor Yvette is how I felt at the end of the movie. You love what you love and like what you like, but I felt like she definitely needed to be barking up another tree. Be that as it may, for their to be a sequel, they\u2019d almost have to be together or else it would be an entire movie about baby mama drama.\n\n7. Does Jody ACTUALLY grow up?\n\nLet\u2019s say that he does actually get some adult about himself, what does THAT look like? Is he a dude with a steady job - say at like the post office - and comes home and takes care of family? Seems like that might make for a short movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. How\u2019s Jody\u2019s mama\u2019s garden looking now?\n\nThat thang was looking mighty nutritious at the end of the movie. It must be a jungle back there now.\n\n9. Who dies?\n\nLook, I hate to be that dude, but this is a South Central love story, kind of. If they all made it to 15 years later I\u2019d be surprised. SOMEBODY might don\u2019t didn\u2019t not make it all the way to the sequel. I might be disappointed if everybody does, to be honest. Shit, somebody dies in Best Man Holiday and that was the upper crust, good health insurance, ain\u2019t in the hood crowd.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10.

But as she tells Allure in its March issue, her own journey to choosing to wear her hair in its natural state was a very different one from the almost instantaneous success she enjoyed after being cast in her Oscar-winning role in 12 Years a Slave.\n\nAs a tween in Kenya, Nyong\u2019o was teased and felt \u201creally unpretty\u201d in comparison with her classmates\u2014who almost all wore their hair relaxed. Her mother wanted her to wait until near adulthood to relax her hair but eventually acquiesced to her daughter\u2019s pleas. Nyong\u2019o explains:\n\nShe took me to the salon in the middle of the school day, and I got my hair relaxed. I felt so much better because it was easier to tame. All the girls in my class had their hair relaxed. Very few had natural kink, so I felt a lot more acceptable. I had my hair relaxed for most of my teenage years, and that was a whole other world. The upkeep of relaxed hair is a commitment. It took styling it once a week and then having it retouched once a month. I remember doing crazy things, like sleeping with my head above the headboard so that my curls wouldn\u2019t get messed up for the next day. I\u2019d have these terrible neck aches because I was determined to keep my hair as pristine as possible. And it was super expensive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, Nyongo\u2019s conversion back to natural hair began in response to a joke from her father while she was asking him for money to support her relaxer habit: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just cut it all off?\u201d he said. She did, having her head shaved completely bald, a choice that she told Allure was \u201cliberating.\u201d\n\nBut the choice wasn\u2019t a cure-all; Nyong\u2019o struggled with managing her texture for years, especially after moving to the northeastern United States for college and graduate school:\n\nMoving to the U.S. was very difficult because I didn\u2019t have the same kind of support system. [Braiding] services were not readily available in Amherst, Massachusetts. For a long time I would braid my hair in Kenya and then spend months with the braids in when I got to the States so that I didn\u2019t have to worry about my hair. Also, my hair did something very different in freezing weather, which I didn\u2019t know how to handle. My hair needs moisture. It needs warmth. All of a sudden I was in this very cold environment, and my hair was bristly and dry and really hard to manage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd while it was Nyong\u2019o\u2019s work with famed stylist Ted Gibson that got many inspired about the versatility of natural hair, it was her current stylist, Vernon Franc\u0327ois, who helped her learn how to manage and care for her natural texture, thanks in large part to his eponymous line of products/ (Franc\u0327ois also provided some insight and tips on how he created the looks for Nyong\u2019o\u2019s Allure cover shoot.)\n\nNyong\u2019o says:\n\n\n\nOne thing I\u2019ve learned was the acronym LOC, and that\u2019s basically the rule for how to treat my hair: liquid, oil, and then cream. It\u2019s the idea that you wet your hair first, then you add oil so that it can trap the moisture in, then you put a moisturizer or a cream over it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNyong\u2019o says that this is the longest her hair has been in a decade. And while we\u2019re guessing that a few extras were added to create the cloudlike coifs she rocks in Allure\u2019s March issue, we\u2019re liking the look on her. We can\u2019t wait to see where her natural-hair journey might take her next.", "keywords": ["relaxed", "journey", "natural", "wait", "hair", "didnt", "allure", "takes", "took", "lupita", "nyongo", "nyongos", "felt"], "polarity": 0.02315238095238094, "subjectivity": 0.4495380952380952},

Blige will attend the 90th Academy Awards not as a guest, presenter or simply a performer, but as a dual nominee for best supporting actress and best original song for Dee Rees\u2019 gripping post-World War II drama, Mudbound. It\u2019s a remarkable first-time feat for a first-time nominee; no other person has ever been nominated in an acting and song category for the same film.\n\nIn Mudbound, Blige plays Florence Jackson, the beleaguered but noble matriarch of a sharecropping family in rural Mississippi. Her stillness often anchors the film, riveting your attention to her every time she is on-screen. In the months since the film\u2019s release and growing Oscar buzz, Blige has spoken frequently about harnessing the power of her sadness from her ongoing divorce from former manager Kendu Isaacs for the role, as well as stripping down to play Florence Jackson. From Vulture:\n\nI\u2019m Mary J. Blige. I mean, like, this is what I do. I wear wigs, I wear bob wigs, and I had to completely strip down to my own natural hair texture, which I\u2019ve always been afraid of. Dee stripped me down all the way to what I truly am, and people were complimenting me. People were saying how beautiful I was. I didn\u2019t know I was that beautiful for real. You understand what I\u2019m saying? I didn\u2019t know that.\n\nTwo-time Emmy Award-winning hairstylist Lawrence Davis was instrumental in that transformational \u201cmakeunder,\u201d using both his extensive historical knowledge and incredible skill to render the Queen of Hip-Hop Soul almost unrecognizable to audiences at last year\u2019s Sundance Film Festival, where Mudbound premiered. Said director Rees: \u201cThe great surprise at Sundance was that people didn\u2019t know it was her until the credits rolled.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Derek Blanks\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIntrigued by the power of Blige\u2019s natural beauty, The Glow Up had the opportunity to talk with Davis about stripping down a megastar like Mary J. Blige, whom he describes as \u201cone of the shyest women on earth ... and so super-sweet.\u201d He tells us:\n\nI remember Mary\u2019s first day coming in for a camera test; I had specific directions from Dee Rees about how she wanted Mary just to strip down. She\u2019s like, \u201cI don\u2019t want wigs, I don\u2019t want this, I don\u2019t want that; I want it all organic.\u201d I said, \u201cYou got it.\u201d So Mary came in the trailer, and she sat in my chair, and we talked a little bit, as I was like, \u201cWell, I just need to get you to trust the process. Trust me to take you where you want to go, and if anything feels uncomfortable, we\u2019ll talk through it. So I [asked], \u2018Are you ready?\u2019 She\u2019s like, \u2018I\u2019m not taking my wig off in front of all these people!\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavis accommodated, clearing out the hair and makeup trailer to unmask the artist as well known for her assortment of blond coifs, lengthy manicures and thigh-high boots as for her hit-making urban ballads and bangers. Of course, Blige tried to negotiate her way into wearing a natural wig to play a sharecropper\u2019s wife, but Davis remained firm:\n\n\u201c\u2018No ... Dee wants you. She wants you to strip down,\u2019\u201d he told Blige. \u201c\u2018She don\u2019t want to see Mary; she wants to see Florence Jackson walk in there for this camera test.\u2019\u201d\n\nDavis ultimately won her trust, peeling back both wig and tracks of weave to reveal Blige\u2019s natural hair. Throughout Mudbound, audiences are seeing Blige\u2019s natural texture at work in creating humble updos and a single scene in which we see her shoulder-length hair hang free. While the star was leery at first, she soon succumbed to the process\u2014and the freedom that came from releasing the trappings of being Mary J. Blige. Says Davis:\n\nShe basically let herself go, and she became Florence right there in that trailer. And with that, it was just taking any hair she had on her head out\u2014no hair, no weave, no wig\u2014taking her nails off, her lashes off. Basically, you got organic Mary. And I would say about the second, third day, Mary was coming in the trailer full-on Afro, just totally free ... [A]nd I could definitely see that she had this freedom that she did not have day one from that point on. And with that, it just took me saying, \u201cYou\u2019re Florence Jackson.\u201d I said, \u201cFlorence, she\u2019s a woman\u2014she lives on a farm, but she takes care of herself. She washes her clothes, she washes her kids\u2019 clothes. She does the best with what she has; she\u2019s a groomed woman. She lives on a farm in the South in the \u201940s. But she takes care of herself and her family.\u201d And that\u2019s who Mary became; she became Florence Jackson.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMary J.

Blige in Mudbound (Netflix) Mary J. Blige and director Dee Rees working on Mudbound (Netflix) 1 / 8\n\nAs for the personal woes that Blige was admittedly experiencing during filming, Davis says he was unaware of the specifics at the time, but definitely noticed the emotional transformation that took place:\n\n[T]here were times when I could feel the heaviness\u2014but didn\u2019t know what it was. But I will say that I literally saw that heaviness go away as she got into this character, and she came in there every day and became Florence Jackson. She started talking more, and that heaviness that was there, it disappeared during this movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs lead hairstylist on Mudbound, Davis was entirely in his element. The Baltimore native has a specific affinity for period hairstyles and has previously flexed his knowledge and skills behind the scenes of era-specific projects like The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, Bessie and Hairspray Live!\u2014for which he won the second of his two Emmys.\n\nDavis got his start in his native city, owning his own salon before making the brave choice to sell it and move to Los Angeles in 2001. Halle Berry\u2019s then-stylist Neeko Abriol gave Davis a shot in his salon, and doors immediately began to open. He has since garnered 81 film and television credits, in addition to leading the hair teams of Being Mary Jane, Greenleaf and Claws. But it is the period pieces that remain his true passion. Case in point: His current project is styling Mahershala Ali into virtuoso pianist Don Shirley for the upcoming film Green Book. As Davis tells The Glow Up:\n\nI honestly feel like I\u2019ve been reincarnated, because as long as I remember\u2014even from being a young kid\u2014I gravitated toward anything that was vintage. Vintage cars, vintage clothing; I loved thrift stores because of the vintage clothing. And when I first got a call to do a period piece, I was most excited because it got to the root of what I wanted to do. You know, hairstyling is great, and I love it. But there\u2019s something that I\u2019m drawn to when it comes to period styling. I love the authenticity of it, and how it brings forth the story and tells the story without there even being any verbiage. You can look at the person and see where they\u2019re from, or what\u2019s going on with them because of maybe the economic setting, but just the style that they\u2019re adorned with\u2014the beautiful hair, the beautiful clothes, the beautiful makeup\u2014all of that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Derek Blanks\n\nBut, specifically, Davis loves working with the natural textures of black hair, and is emphatic that it be portrayed accurately on-screen. For him, there is an eternal elegance to natural hair. He believes that natural hairstyles belong in every film and on every red carpet because they are part of our legacy of style:\n\nBlack women, even before they started pressing their hair, they basically knew how to create these wonderful shapes out of natural hair; these silhouettes and things like that that speak elegance and class without pressing it out and going bone straight and having it go silky and shiny. It just was a beautiful, beautiful thing to see. ... But we definitely have the most beautiful hair to me on earth. And you know we wear it well, and I think that in any period movie\u2014no matter what period it is\u2014I think there always should be a black woman with natural hair. ... I just feel like black hair\u2014natural hair\u2014should always be a part of it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut if Davis is excited about the resurgence of natural hair on-screen and on the red carpet alike, he also loves that even black women who wear wigs are gravitating toward styles with more texture in them (e.g., Viola Davis\u2019 incredible Golden Globes look this year). He predicts that at the Oscars this Sunday and many to come, we may bring even more natural styles and braided updos to the step-and-repeat, and tells us:\n\nI think women are much more open to showing exactly, you know, what\u2019s under that wig as opposed to covering up nowadays. And I look at every award show and I always see somebody come forth and say, \u201cNo, this is who I am, and this is who I have been and I want to show it.\u201d ... I think that even when other races look at us and see us out there in our natural form, they love it, because it tells them how proud we are as a people and how proud we are to show what\u2019s natural about us, and what\u2019s unique about us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly how Davis thinks it should be. For him, natural hair has always been far more than just a trend or a movement: \u201cJust call it us. ... I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a movement anymore; I just think it is reality. It\u2019s who we are, and we\u2019re proud of it.\u201d", "keywords": ["mudbound", "natural", "florence", "hair", "hiphop", "netflix", "davis", "soul", "unmaking", "lawrence", "j", "blige", "mary", "talks", "beautiful", "hairstylist", "queen"], "polarity": 0.2369808449695669, "subjectivity": 0.49995972073039713},

Back in December, the midseason finale ended with a bang\u2014and for once it didn\u2019t involve Lucious shooting someone or him getting shot.\n\n\n\nStill, Lucious tried to kill Angelo Dubois\u2019 mayoral career\u2014or at least leave a nasty scar. The Lyons\u2019 eldest son, Andre, continued his descent into darkness and revealed a plan to kill Papa Lyon. Can you blame him? Can you? It\u2019s a wonder the whole family doesn\u2019t join in.\n\nBoo Kitty was back to season 1 form, and the wardrobe department returned to Frederick\u2019s of Hollywood, so we got to see a nearly naked Miss Kitty randomly prance around without discretion. It\u2019s not that I have a lady crush on Miss Boo Boo, but her antics give Leslie Uggams\u2019 Leah Walker more biting one-liners. Obviously, I have a lady crush on Leah.\n\nBest of all, Cookie, Cookie, Cookie. The show bowed down to the queen and mined her surprising family history to reveal that she was once a good, studious girl, until she met Lucious and gave up a promising future as a spelling bee champ and mathlete. There was so much good stuff in the finale; here\u2019s what I hope happens for the rest of the season.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. Andre continues taking his life goals from The Godfather playbook.\n\nLet\u2019s not forget that to get his way in a business deal with Gina Gershon\u2019s Helene \u201cI\u2019m Not a Racist\u201d Von Wyeth, Andre issued a warning by hacking off Helen\u2019s daughter\u2019s hair while the little girl was sleeping. A little girl! The child was a blonde, too, and you know how white people have a bizarre attachment to blond hair. Andre got his way, of course. Oh yeah, he also announced his plan to kill Lucious. No judgment. Bad Andre is all kinds of sexy, especially when he puts on the hat, so I say: Have at it, Andre. Speaking of ...\n\n2. They bring on the bad-girl bitchery.\n\nAndre\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9/love interest, Nessa, is shady AF. After she deliberately set Tiana\u2019s couture dress ablaze before a big event and made sure the ensuing tantrum went viral, Nessa put on her lipstick, raised one eyebrow of evil and took Tiana\u2019s place in a big show. If you ask me, Sierra Aylina McClain\u2019s Nessa makes a top-notch bitch, and the show needed one for the younger set.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though she\u2019s been around since the first season, I never found myself going, \u201cWhere\u2019s Tiana? I miss her.\u201d I save my longing for Cookie\u2019s clunky assistant, Porsha, who makes me clap my hands with glee when she galumphs into a scene with her lollipop. Anyway, if Empire plans to do anything with Tiana, keep adding fuel to this dueling-divas story and let the catfights begin. Lock each other in broom closets; knock each other offstage. Make it work.\n\n3. Gimme a shower song, please.\n\nNot to bring up old scars, but I have never recovered from Lucious\u2019 \u201cBoom, Boom, Boom, Boom\u201d mess. \u201cBlack Girl Magic\u201d gave me an empowering song to butcher. Contact me if you\u2019re interested in a cringeworthy karaoke night!\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Leah Walker is allowed to do some dirty work.\n\nLucious\u2019 mom is crazy like a fox. OK, she\u2019s actually crazy, but it was hilarious to find out that she and Lucious were working together to thwart Tariq\u2019s sting operation and hopefully let the Tariq-vs.-Lucious thing drop. I\u2019m not saying the tale of Lucious\u2019 long-lost stepbrother/FBI agent was uninteresting; I\u2019m just saying ... Zzzzzzzzz. Whoops, I just nodded off there for a couple of minutes. Empire should trot out Leah every time there\u2019s a lackluster storyline. The best part of Leah\u2019s mischief: You can\u2019t always tell if she\u2019s off her meds or if she\u2019s just stirring up trouble.\n\n5. Last but not least, Cookie goes to Washington.\n\nOr at least Gracie Mansion. Can\u2019t you just picture Cookie as New York City\u2019s first lady? To get even with Clair Huxtable, aka Diana Dubois, for getting haughty with him (and probably to mess up Cookie\u2019s shot at romance), Lucious maneuvered to bring Angelo Dubois\u2019 sordid past to light. The pol\u2019s drunk driving killed a girl, and he ran off. Look, it didn\u2019t end Teddy Kennedy\u2019s career, and he probably would have made it to the White House if he had the advantage of the \u201cCookie effect.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe constituents love Cookie. Let her smooth things over, maybe distract everyone with a glitzy wedding and then have Cookie join the political scene. Or just make her mayor. Phylicia Rashad and Taraji P. Henson are brilliant together. Let\u2019s watch \u2019em duke it out with higher stakes.

Appearing for her third supporting actress nod for eventual best picture winner The Shape of Water, the actress and children\u2019s-book author was styled by sister team Wendi and Nicole in an ethereal green gown that evoked the flowing depths of the sea.\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images)\n\nAs we\u2019ve learned from several female celebs who don\u2019t fit the typical Hollywood starlet mold\u2014including being over 40 and not a sample size\u2014it can sometimes be a struggle to find red-carpet-worthy gowns. Christian Siriano and Tadashi Shoji have both become reliable industry sources for all-inclusive glamour, but Spencer nailed her look Sunday night courtesy of one of our fashion faves, Brandon Maxwell (who also dressed best actress winner Alison Janney and our hilarious homegirl Tiffany Haddish for the Vanity Fair after-party Sunday night). In a lovely Instagram post, Maxwell wrote:\n\nI am very proud, with my team, to have dressed Best Supporting Actress nominee @octaviaspencer in a custom emerald green satin faced organza gown for Tonight\u2019s 90th Annual Academy Awards. Octavia makes history tonight with her third nomination, and we are beyond honored to be a part of her special moment.\n\nWhat we loved about this dress is how well the belted silhouette and full, flowing skirt highlighted Spencer\u2019s curvy figure, as well as the deep emerald green, which played to perfection against her brown skin\u2014which we were thrilled to see more of on display. But our favorite aspect by far was the off-the-shoulder neckline, which framed her beautiful face and shoulders, which were grazed by a wavy bob, styled by celebrity hairstylist and groomer David Stanwell.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStanwell began working with Spencer five years ago while at the Cannes Film Festival to promote Fruitvale Station. He says he hit it off with the acclaimed actress the moment they met, telling The Glow Up: \u201cShe has a great sense of humor, and we always have a fun time together. She is professional, and all those elements make for a good work environment.\u201d\n\nThis awards season, Spencer\u2019s hair\u2014which Stanwell tells us is naturally curly and pressed out\u2014has consistently looked stunning, with the actress frequently rocking loose waves to accent her array of red-carpet looks. Stanwell tells us:\n\nOctavia loves curls in the hair\u2014big, medium, and sometimes smaller! We always opt for curls going away from [the] face, and we alternate the tightness depending upon the size of the curling iron. The only time we don\u2019t curl is if we do a slicked-back look with a bun or ponytail. As most award shows are long, we like to stick to simple and practical looks, yet still with a glamorous edge without being too fussy. Our influence always comes from classic and elegant so we always end up in that wheelhouse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Tristan Fewings (Getty Images)\n\nWhile Stanwell is always willing to gently push his star client to try something new and different, he\u2019s also very respectful of her comfort zone and happiness on the red carpet. But when Stanwell saw a sketch of Spencer\u2019s 2018 Oscar gown, he was inspired to take her look shorter to keep the shoulders bare, telling us:\n\nOctavia had sent me the sketch of her dress [last] week, which helped spark my inspiration for [Sunday night\u2019s] look. Instantly, I knew I wanted to do a side part, so that one side was off the shoulder to compliment her dress and jewelry. Octavia liked the idea of a curl, but not too brushed out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStanwell says his secret to keeping Spencer\u2019s hair looking glamorous and healthy is simpler\u2014and far less expensive\u2014than one might think. For Spencer, he\u2019s been relying on a variety of Dove hair products, which, in his words, \u201c[have] helped with that shine and healthy glow that we all want for our hair.\u201d\n\nWe were curious, so he graciously gave The Glow Up a how-to on Spencer\u2019s wavy Oscars bob:\n\n\u201cI started prepping the hair by mixing Dove Style + Care Smooth & Shine Heat Protection Spray and a dollop of Dove Absolute Curls Supreme Cr\u00e8me Serum together to moisturize her hair before applying any heat.\n\n\u201cUsing a large, round brush, I blow-dried her hair to create the desired face-framing shape. We decided on taking the hair shorter [for the night], so after I blow-dried it, I made a deep side part to add more definition to the look.\n\n\u201cAfter I finished blow-drying the hair, I went through it with a 1-inch curling iron to create glamorous, defined waves by twisting the hair toward her face.\n\n\u201cWhile the hair was cooling, I sprayed Dove Style + Care Compressed Micro Mist Flexible Hold Hairspray to give it that extra hold before running my hands through to break up the curls. [Pro tip: Waiting until the hair is cool enough to run one\u2019s fingers through it gives it a fabulous curl that will last all night long.]\n\n\u201cAfter shaping the hair and dressing it around her face, I tucked the curls on the right side of her face behind her ear to give it a romantic feel and show off her jewelry. To finish, I sprayed Dove Style + Care Compressed Micro Mist Flexible Hold Hairspray again throughout the hair to give it a boost of shine.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe have to give credit to Stanwell and Spencer\u2019s entire glam squad for giving one of our screen queens the Cinderella moment she so richly deserved. It\u2019s always exciting to see a star\u2019s style evolve, and while Spencer isn\u2019t known for glamorous roles, we\u2019re hoping to see these gorgeous, age-appropriate (and subtly sexy!) red-carpet moments continue for her.

In the past four years, the third-generation hairstylist has been making her mark on Marvel films, leading the hair departments of the last two Captain America films, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 and, now, Black Panther.\n\nOf course, the Black Panther is a unique superhero, and Black Panther is already proving to be an exceptionally unique film, as Friend tells The Glow Up:\n\nI think Black Panther is\u2014I call it a stand-alone Marvel movie, even though Marvel still has a formula. But I feel like it\u2019s a stand-alone movie, especially for me, because I\u2019m a black woman, and [to do] the first black superhero, that was really an honor, in the sense [that] we\u2019re presenting all of this to the world. We had an important job to do, and I looked at it in a whole different way, because it represents my people. So I felt like, the weight of the world on me at some points, but in the greatest way\u2014that I had the opportunity to present us in the best possible light and put something on camera that\u2019s never been [seen]. So it\u2019s a great responsibility and it\u2019s a great challenge, but it\u2019s my greatest joy in doing it, also.\n\nRepresenting her people was paramount in Friend\u2019s mind as she approached the task of helping to bring Black Panther to life. To begin, she divided the film into three elements: traditional Africa, contemporary Africa and the futuristic Africa represented by the technologically advanced civilization that is Wakanda. In her research, she drew inspiration from everything from traditional African tribes like the Maasai and Zulu to the groundbreaking fashion statements we\u2019ve seen at Afropunk celebrations around the globe.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really taking and looking at traditional styles, traditional tribal looks, and seeing what we can make into a modern style,\u201d Friend says. \u201cI like to take, like, a period hairstyle and put it in a modern movie and just put a twist on it. For me, it\u2019s still about classic hairdressing and beautiful lines and silhouettes. That\u2019s how I design hair.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFriend has certainly had her share of experience with period styles, having also headed the hair departments of Miles Ahead, The Help, Django Unchained, Rock of Ages and Dreamgirls. But whether it\u2019s long and flowing or elaborately braided and twisted, one thing you won\u2019t see in Black Panther is any straightened hair. For Friend, natural hair textures were a major part of her contribution to the visual narrative.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a beautiful time where people are wearing their natural hair,\u201d she says. \u201cI mean, there [are] women everywhere who are like, \u2018Throw the pressing comb away, throw the relaxer away. I\u2019m going to wear my natural hair.\u2019 So that whole movement of the empowerment of the hair is there,\u201d Friend explains.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCreating a diverse universe of naturally styled characters involved a team highly skilled in styling, caring for and mimicking natural hairstyles, as in the case of Angela Bassett\u2019s glorious custom-made wig of 24-inch silvery locs, inspired in equal parts by writer Toni Morrison and director Ryan Coogler\u2019s mother, Joselyn.\n\nBut while Friend isn\u2019t playing favorites on the styles she created, she\u2019s already seeing the influence this film is having on our beauty and fashion choices. She\u2019s received countless raves on the twisted crop Lupita Nyong\u2019o rocks as Dora Milaje operative Nakia and graciously provided The Glow Up with the how-to (hint: The key is keeping it close to the scalp):\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the \u2018Wakanda knot\u2019\u2014because it is different than a Bantu knot,\u201d she tells us. \u201c[Because] basically, the hair is rolled down, kind of like a cinnamon roll. And then, once the hair is dried, then, we lifted it from there.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEducating other hairstylists is a huge part of Friend\u2019s career, as her greatest hope is to see more hairstylists performing at the top of their game. That\u2019s why she created Hair Scholars, a consortium of award-winning artists led by Friend in educating and preparing aspiring stylists to be the best at their craft and ready to work in the industry.\n\nFriend knows firsthand the value of having a talented team by her side. She credits her Black Panther team for being a large part of the inspiration and craftsmanship that we\u2019ll see on-screen next week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt just felt like our brains\u2014the brainpower was just so high, and the energy was so high, just because we got to create,\u201d she says. \u201cOr somebody\u2019s like, \u2018Well, let\u2019s try this.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018Let\u2019s try it!\u2019\n\n\u201cSo it was really great to have that think tank, where we could just be in there and be creating, and just really coming up with things on the fly ... just really having the momentum just to create original pieces that are going to stand the test of time on film,\u201d she continues.\n\nAnd of course, we couldn\u2019t end our conversation without asking Friend how it felt to be on the purple carpet for Black Panther\u2019s epic premiere in Los Angeles last week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe premiere was like, you know, it was like 2018 Coming to America\u2014like, it was for real. People took it all the way,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I think what it is too, is as black people, we have like\u2014especially now\u2014there\u2019s a sense of pride. People are wearing their hair natural. People are [saying] \u2018black excellence.\u2019 People are rising to the occasion, and I think this movie comes at the time where black people, we want to step forward; we want to be recognized.\n\n\u201cThis movie hits all the right notes for having a black superhero,\u201d she explains. \u201cI mean, at the end of the day, we all want to be superheroes, in whatever we do. If we\u2019re a mom, if we\u2019re a secretary, if we\u2019re a hairdresser\u2014whatever we do, we all want to be a superhero.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up tip: If you\u2019re an Los Angeles-based hair artist, you can join Camille Friend for a Hair Scholars master class at the \u201cHair and Makeup by ... \u201d Symposium on March 11 from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.", "keywords": ["panthers", "natural", "really", "movie", "think", "hair", "friend", "designer", "meet", "having", "traditional", "panther", "teamsupernatural", "black", "hero", "camille"], "polarity": 0.17398076259489295, "subjectivity": 0.5284920634920632},

(If you haven\u2019t already, join The Glow Up Facebook group to participate in a live red-carpet roundup with us at 6:45 p.m. EST.)\n\nBut in a season full of honors and awards shows, we have a special place in our hearts for the one with an independent streak. On Saturday the stars came out to celebrate the 33rd Annual Independent Spirit Awards in Santa Monica, Calif. And we didn\u2019t come away disappointed.\n\nAs its name suggests, the Independent Spirit Awards honor the best independent films of each year. The ceremony is presented by the organization Film Independent and traditionally takes place the day before the Academy Awards.\n\nOf course, as independent films have gained greater prominence in the mainstream in recent years, there has been increasing crossover between the nominees of the two events. But what keeps the Independent Spirit Awards so relevant and refreshing is seeing some of our faves get the recognition they deserve.\n\nFor instance, the big winner yesterday was director and writer Jordan Peele, who won in both the Best Director and Best Picture categories for his brilliant breakout hit, Get Out\u2014and was presented his awards by actor Chadwick Boseman and legendary director Spike Lee, respectively. We can only hope that his winning streak follows him to the Academy Awards Sunday night; but even if it doesn\u2019t, it was gratifying to see our favorite film of 2017 get the respect it deserved.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Tommaso Boddi (Getty Images)\n\nAnother big honor was given to director Dee Rees and the cast and crew of Mudbound, who were awarded the Robert Altman Award for a remarkable ensemble cast, director and casting director. Rees gave an incredible speech that drove home the fact that, in her words, \u201cMudbound is cinema.\u201d\n\n\n\nFilm Independent via YouTube\n\nBut perhaps our favorite aspect of the Independent Spirit Awards is how fully it lives up to its name. In contrast to the formality of the Academy Awards, the independent spirit is alive and well at this awards ceremony, and the stars revel in it. Even the step-and-repeat has a dynamically different quality as celebs pose for candid portraits, rather than typical paparazzi shots.

What?! This is the true story of Margot Lee Shetterly. She is the black woman who helped bring Hidden Figures to life.\n\nHidden Figures is the amazing but previously untold story of three black female mathematicians\u2014Katherine Johnson, Mary Jackson and Dorothy Vaughan; their contributions to NASA; and pretty much their role in helping shape America's history in space exploration.\n\nThis story is not only a surefire box-office smash but also a book that was written as the movie was being produced. Shetterly is now a New York Times best-selling author, and Hidden Figures is also the No. 1 young readers book. Shetterly wondered, as we all did, how does that happen on your first book? She and I chatted on the phone, mostly gushing over her seemingly overnight success. \"It\u2019s a lightning strike \u2026 fairy dust,\" she said.\n\n\"I wrote the book I wanted to read,\" she added. \"I wanted those kinds of women protagonists\u2014strong, smart, successful, and [I wanted] to show the challenges they faced. I wanted it big and American.\"\n\nShetterly also wanted the world to see that black people are as much a part of American history as anyone. \"I didn\u2019t know how badly other people wanted it, not just black women.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd what a revelation!\n\nBefore the book was even finished, Hidden Figures producer Donna Gigliotti put it in the hands of Hollywood heavyweights and told Shetterly, \"We're going to make \u2026 a movie out of your book proposal.\" Within three years, both the book and the movie were finished.\n\nAnd now Shetterly has gone from an unknown writer to a best-seller who not only gets to be in the same room as first lady Michelle Obama but also gets to be praised by her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo what's next? How do you move up from this height as an author? Shetterly is already working on her next book, which is part of the trilogy that Hidden Figures kicks off. Can we say \u201cYay!\u201d about more black history being revealed?\n\nShetterly is obsessed with midcentury stories and wants to continue telling them. She tells me, \"The new story [I'm working on] is also unseen, but not quite untold. It deals with midcentury. Anything I will ever do in life will not be as consuming and overwhelming as Hidden Figures.\"\n\nShe's modest, which is understandable, because not everyone gets this type of love with a first book, but success can be fleeting. I'm sure, though, that Shetterly will continue to see major success so long as she's writing our stories with such care and honesty. I'm looking forward to her continued success and am just glad I get to help tell her story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWatch the interview with Shetterly:\n\n\n\n", "keywords": ["hidden", "wanted", "im", "margot", "limits", "figures", "shetterlys", "proves", "book", "success", "history", "blackgirlmagic", "knows", "lee", "shetterly", "movie", "black"], "polarity": 0.09996526107637219, "subjectivity": 0.4270936882047993},

I mean, we know she\u2019s an Oakland, Calif., native, and a child model-turned-Disney starlet. We know she appeared on Dancing With the Stars before scoring the coveted role of M.J. in the latest installment of the Spider-Man franchise. We even know she\u2019s also a singer whose 2014 single \u201cReplay\u201d hit No. 40 on the Billboard charts, and most recently she sang while swinging on a flying trapeze in Hugh Jackman\u2019s latest film, the Oscar-nominated The Greatest Showman.\n\nBut we can\u2019t really pinpoint the moment when she arrived\u2014on our radar, at least. It feels as if we just looked up one day and there she was, stunning and perfectly deserving of the spotlight. All we know is that we\u2019ve had a hard time taking our eyes off of her ever since, because she consistently gets it right on the red carpet.\n\nThe 90th annual Academy Awards ceremony was no exception. The Glow Up Facebook live thread collectively gasped when Zendaya appeared on the step-and-repeat in a one-sleeved, deep-sienna-colored chiffon gown by Giambattista Valli. (Notably, the gown beautifully photographed chocolate brown against the red carpet, then appeared a burnished burgundy against the Oscars stage set, where she was a presenter.) On another star, the voluminous silhouette might have been overwhelming, but at a willowy 5 feet 10 inches, the 21-year-old looked like a true goddess, even as an ingenue among established megastars.\n\nBut everyone knows it takes a village to raise a successful red-carpet look, and Zendaya has found a dream team in stylist Law Roach (who also styled Mary J. Blige for the evening), makeup artist Sheika Daley and hairstylist Ursula Stephen, the mastermind who created many of Rihanna\u2019s most iconic looks.\n\nTo offset the volume of her dress, Stephen chose to keep her starlet\u2019s hair stylish and simple, telling The Glow Up, \u201cZendaya and I went back and forth about her look for tonight\u2019s show, but ultimately landed on a sleek and chic top knot to enhance the elegant silhouette created by her Giambattista Valli dress.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images)\n\nBut pulled-back doesn\u2019t automatically mean easy, especially when you\u2019re creating a style that has to last from the awards ceremony through the after-party. So Stephen\u2014a brand ambassador for Unilever as well as Dyson hair products\u2014gave The Glow Up her step-by-step on how to create the perfect topknot\u2014using her go-to tools and products. With most of these products available in our local drugstore, frankly, this is a high-low tutorial we can wrap our heads around. Says Stephen:\n\n\n\n\u201cI prepped Zendaya\u2019s damp hair by spritzing Dove Style + Care Smooth & Shine Heat Protection Spray [$5.99] throughout before blow-drying as straight as possible with my Dyson Supersonic hair dryer [$399.99], which was on high heat and speed.\n\n\u201cOnce the hair was dry\u2014and super shiny!\u2014I sprayed with Suave Professionals Natural Hold Compressed Micro Mist Hairspray [$3.94] and separated her hair in half from ear to ear and brushed the top section into a high ponytail, securing it with an elastic.\n\n\u201cNext, I brought the bottom section up and secured the two pieces together before twisting them up into a chic little knot, which I secured with hair pins. [Pro tip: Separating the hair into sections allows for more control over the look and ensures security through the night.]\n\n\u201cI finished the look with TRESemm\u00e9 Compressed Micro-Mist Hair Spray Hold Level 2: Smooth [$4.99] to keep strands sleek and in place all night, without the stiffness and crunch of a traditional hair spray.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Christopher Polk (Getty Images)\n\nOf course, pulling the star\u2019s hair off her face perfectly showcased a glowing face and gorgeous sienna smoky eye by makeup artist Sheika Daley. [Editor\u2019s note: The Glow Up reached out to Daley for the specific tricks and tools she used Oscar night, but as of press time, we haven\u2019t received the details.] To re-create the look, we\u2019d suggest using eye shadow colors from the Masquerade palette by Juvia\u2019s Place ($25 for a mini palette), or the Obsessions palette in Warm Brown from Huda Beauty ($27). To quickly create a sultry, smoky eye similar to Zendaya\u2019s:\n\nApply an eye shadow base or primer, to lock in color. We like Black Up\u2019s new Matte Eye Primer ($23). Apply liquid liner to the upper lash line, avoiding an obvious cat eye. Define the outer corners of each crease with a dark matte brown eye shadow shade. Using a deep mahogany shade, smoke the eye from lash to just above the crease, extending slightly at the outer ends.\n\nUse a fine brush to lightly smudge the same color on the lower lash line. Pop the inner corners of the eyes with a shimmering champagne shadow. Apply several layers of mascara\u2014making sure to avoid clumps!\n\nNeedless to say, we loved this look, not only for its drama but also for its timeless simplicity. The 90th annual Academy Awards were so filled with nostalgia that Rita Moreno even wore the dress she wore when she accepted her 1962 Oscar (and still fit in beautifully!) for West Side Story. But looking at Zendaya\u2019s gorgeous goddess-inspired glamour last night, it\u2019s hard to think that her polished, graceful beauty will ever go out of style.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images)\n\nEditor\u2019s note: A previous version of this post erroneously referred to the character of M.J. as the romantic interest in Spider-Man: Homecoming.", "keywords": ["oscars", "glamour", "look", "zendaya", "know", "getty", "served", "hair", "night", "shadow", "palette", "glow", "simply", "stunning", "eye"], "polarity": 0.21726044554696233, "subjectivity": 0.5395757737892568},

And how about an \u00fcber-talented hairdresser like Tym Wallace scrutinizing your every move via a super-closeup iPhone app for moviemakers? You would be flawless, that\u2019s what. Don\u2019t take my word for it, though; see for yourself when Proud Mary,\n\nTaraji P. Henson\u2019s latest star vehicle, hits the big screen today, Friday, Jan. 12.\n\nTo celebrate the film\u2019s release\u2014and all things hair\u2014Wallace, along with hair-care brand Creme of Nature, recently hosted a bevy of beauty editors in the penthouse suite of 60 Thompson, a sexy little boutique hotel in New York City\u2019s SoHo neighborhood.\n\nChampagne and high tea were served while Wallace\u2014who had just wrapped a publicity shoot in the adjacent suite of rooms\u2014emerged and took his place at the center of the circle to tell the tale of how he built the hair story for Henson\u2019s titular role as Mary. \u201cNot since Pam Grier have we seen a role like this on film,\u201d he said.\n\nClad in all black, with a razor-sharp brushed fade and a flute of Champagne at the end of his Yakuza sleeve-tattooed arm, he proceeded to hold court with a nod to the current national mood: \u201cIt\u2019s great to see women taking their power back,\u201d declared Wallace as the room raised their glasses in agreement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWallace\u2019s reading of the script for Proud Mary, directed by Babak Najafi, led him to create hairstyles so closely interwoven with the plot that he could scarcely reveal the number of hair changes, for fear of spoiler alerts. Wallace explained, \u201cContract killers move in mystery and in silence\u2014the outside world is not supposed to know the personality of a killer.\u201d\n\nThe role had many challenges: creating a look that was simultaneously fly, incognito and capable of standing up to the physical demands of Henson performing many of her own stunts. Wallace\u2019s tactic was simple: \u201cKeep it minimal,\u201d killing it with a series of high-end human-hair wigs.\n\nTo hold those $575-a-piece human-hair wigs in place during filming, his adhesive of choice was spirit gum, specifically from WM Creations in its matte finish. Wallace, who has been looking after Henson\u2019s tresses since the two met in 2015, does not like using glue for wigs; he feels it damages the hair and doesn\u2019t clean up easily with 99 percent alcohol, the way spirit gum does. He\u2019s a fan of buying French hairpins by the pound to secure wigs and pieces.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo matter what you\u2019re doing with your hair, Wallace maintains that edge care is a major issue\u2014certainly, removing and regluing wigs twice a day takes its toll. His No. 1 weapon in the war on edge erosion is his own \u201cspecial concoction\u201d of oils, including Jamaican black castor, jojoba, tea tree and coconut oils, adding a dash of lavender oil to neutralize the smell of the castor oil.\n\nAs for working with Henson, Wallace says she\u2019s the kind of client \u201cI prayed for. She\u2019s hilarious and she lets me do anything and everything to her hair.\u201d But one thing Wallace won\u2019t do is leave a weave in longer than two months without taking it out for a one-week breather and mandatory maintenance, which always includes trimming split ends. \u201cOne bad petal kills a whole flower; same for split ends in your hair.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe also cautions against braiding hair too tightly, citing an epidemic of traction alopecia he\u2019s been seeing lately, due to braiders who are so deft at their craft they can \u201ccatch and braid your eyebrows!\u201d\u2014a truth that made the room erupt in laughter. But Wallace got serious as he slid his signature glasses down his nose, peering sincerely at the editors gathered: \u201cTell your braider not to touch your edges, and give those braids some slack.\u201d\n\nFor everyday edge care, he advises using edge-taming products that don\u2019t list alcohol as the No. 1 ingredient. He also swears by tinted gels to boost the shine and luster of edges, giving that extra touch of #BlackGirlMagic. According to the Wallace gospel\u2014where hair is a \u201crelatable form of ministry\u201d\u2014tips for maintaining straight hair include using leave-in conditioner and heat-protectant products.\n\nNow in his 12th year as a hairdresser, he\u2019s happy to see that so many women have had a come-to-Jesus moment and joined the natural-hair movement. Says Wallace: \u201cWe have the best hair in the world. It does everything. All we have to do is protect it.\u201d\n\n", "keywords": ["killer", "using", "proud", "role", "tym", "hair", "tarajis", "hes", "secrets", "making", "wallace", "hensons", "edge", "does", "wigs", "world", "stylist", "shares", "mary"], "polarity": 0.24024927142574204, "subjectivity": 0.5239982457629516},

The afternoon\u2019s honors went to actress and comedian Tiffany Haddish; actress and writer Danai Gurira; Emmy Award-winning writer, director and actress Lena Waithe; and actress and activist Tessa Thompson.\n\nWaithe was honored with the Ford Vanguard Award and used her acceptance speech to proclaim her love for fiancee Alana Mayo, saying, \u201cWho knew that in 2018 that would still be considered a revolutionary act?\u201d She went on to encourage her closeted colleagues who are \u201cstill hiding\u201d to stay true to themselves, saying in part:\n\n[We\u2019re] hiding because we don\u2019t want to lose an endorsement deal. Hiding because they want to be \u201cnormal.\u201d Hiding because we don\u2019t want to make white folks uneasy. But most of all, hiding because we don\u2019t want to make our own people uncomfortable. ... Being born gay, black and female is not a revolutionary act. Being proud to be a gay black female is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWaithe\u2019s powerful message reportedly garnered loud applause from the audience of luminaries as she added: \u201cIt\u2019s not just my job to make art ... but to be a shining light for all the little lesbians in training. To care about them more than my bank account.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Gurira also spoke about understanding her increased visibility and impact on younger generations since her standout role as Dora Milaje general Okoye in Black Panther, saying:\n\nThis journey has led me many a time to the presence of young people. .... Young people who look at me to give them something to hold onto, that special nugget that just may help them get through. And, I realized that sometimes I forget what it was like to be that young, to struggle in your own skin that much. To grapple with a world system that was clearly not made for us in mind. To be unsure of your place in this realm, of how you will ever find it or how you will ever like yourself, let alone love yourself. ... We\u2019ve been lied to and our youth are struggling with those lies, drowning in them. Being denied their greatness because there are so many lies standing between them and their true selves. We have to repel, dispel the lies.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven just reading their words, we were deeply inspired by the words of these phenomenal women.

And she's right! It is about time that we learn not only about these three pioneers but also about other black women who have contributed to our development in STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) fields and set the tone for us to dream bigger than what we see in front of us.\n\nSpencer continued, \"The fact that none of us knew their names says a lot about history, but we're rewriting it.\" It's the rewriting of our history that's allowing us to be a part of it because, guess what\u2014we were! Our futures look a lot brighter because of women like Johnson, Jackson and Vaughan who were fearless enough to do the groundwork.\n\nWe now have women like Shelia Nash-Stevenson, Ph.D., a NASA engineer who continues to break barriers; and Stephanie Wilson, a NASA engineer and astronaut!

Appearing for her third supporting actress nod for eventual best picture winner The Shape of Water, the actress and children\u2019s-book author was styled by sister team Wendi and Nicole in an ethereal green gown that evoked the flowing depths of the sea.\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images)\n\nAs we\u2019ve learned from several female celebs who don\u2019t fit the typical Hollywood starlet mold\u2014including being over 40 and not a sample size\u2014it can sometimes be a struggle to find red-carpet-worthy gowns. Christian Siriano and Tadashi Shoji have both become reliable industry sources for all-inclusive glamour, but Spencer nailed her look Sunday night courtesy of one of our fashion faves, Brandon Maxwell (who also dressed best actress winner Alison Janney and our hilarious homegirl Tiffany Haddish for the Vanity Fair after-party Sunday night). In a lovely Instagram post, Maxwell wrote:\n\nI am very proud, with my team, to have dressed Best Supporting Actress nominee @octaviaspencer in a custom emerald green satin faced organza gown for Tonight\u2019s 90th Annual Academy Awards. Octavia makes history tonight with her third nomination, and we are beyond honored to be a part of her special moment.\n\nWhat we loved about this dress is how well the belted silhouette and full, flowing skirt highlighted Spencer\u2019s curvy figure, as well as the deep emerald green, which played to perfection against her brown skin\u2014which we were thrilled to see more of on display. But our favorite aspect by far was the off-the-shoulder neckline, which framed her beautiful face and shoulders, which were grazed by a wavy bob, styled by celebrity hairstylist and groomer David Stanwell.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStanwell began working with Spencer five years ago while at the Cannes Film Festival to promote Fruitvale Station. He says he hit it off with the acclaimed actress the moment they met, telling The Glow Up: \u201cShe has a great sense of humor, and we always have a fun time together. She is professional, and all those elements make for a good work environment.\u201d\n\nThis awards season, Spencer\u2019s hair\u2014which Stanwell tells us is naturally curly and pressed out\u2014has consistently looked stunning, with the actress frequently rocking loose waves to accent her array of red-carpet looks. Stanwell tells us:\n\nOctavia loves curls in the hair\u2014big, medium, and sometimes smaller! We always opt for curls going away from [the] face, and we alternate the tightness depending upon the size of the curling iron. The only time we don\u2019t curl is if we do a slicked-back look with a bun or ponytail. As most award shows are long, we like to stick to simple and practical looks, yet still with a glamorous edge without being too fussy. Our influence always comes from classic and elegant so we always end up in that wheelhouse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Tristan Fewings (Getty Images)\n\nWhile Stanwell is always willing to gently push his star client to try something new and different, he\u2019s also very respectful of her comfort zone and happiness on the red carpet. But when Stanwell saw a sketch of Spencer\u2019s 2018 Oscar gown, he was inspired to take her look shorter to keep the shoulders bare, telling us:\n\nOctavia had sent me the sketch of her dress [last] week, which helped spark my inspiration for [Sunday night\u2019s] look. Instantly, I knew I wanted to do a side part, so that one side was off the shoulder to compliment her dress and jewelry. Octavia liked the idea of a curl, but not too brushed out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStanwell says his secret to keeping Spencer\u2019s hair looking glamorous and healthy is simpler\u2014and far less expensive\u2014than one might think. For Spencer, he\u2019s been relying on a variety of Dove hair products, which, in his words, \u201c[have] helped with that shine and healthy glow that we all want for our hair.\u201d\n\nWe were curious, so he graciously gave The Glow Up a how-to on Spencer\u2019s wavy Oscars bob:\n\n\u201cI started prepping the hair by mixing Dove Style + Care Smooth & Shine Heat Protection Spray and a dollop of Dove Absolute Curls Supreme Cr\u00e8me Serum together to moisturize her hair before applying any heat.\n\n\u201cUsing a large, round brush, I blow-dried her hair to create the desired face-framing shape. We decided on taking the hair shorter [for the night], so after I blow-dried it, I made a deep side part to add more definition to the look.\n\n\u201cAfter I finished blow-drying the hair, I went through it with a 1-inch curling iron to create glamorous, defined waves by twisting the hair toward her face.\n\n\u201cWhile the hair was cooling, I sprayed Dove Style + Care Compressed Micro Mist Flexible Hold Hairspray to give it that extra hold before running my hands through to break up the curls. [Pro tip: Waiting until the hair is cool enough to run one\u2019s fingers through it gives it a fabulous curl that will last all night long.]\n\n\u201cAfter shaping the hair and dressing it around her face, I tucked the curls on the right side of her face behind her ear to give it a romantic feel and show off her jewelry. To finish, I sprayed Dove Style + Care Compressed Micro Mist Flexible Hold Hairspray again throughout the hair to give it a boost of shine.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe have to give credit to Stanwell and Spencer\u2019s entire glam squad for giving one of our screen queens the Cinderella moment she so richly deserved. It\u2019s always exciting to see a star\u2019s style evolve, and while Spencer isn\u2019t known for glamorous roles, we\u2019re hoping to see these gorgeous, age-appropriate (and subtly sexy!) red-carpet moments continue for her.

Blige will attend the 90th Academy Awards not as a guest, presenter or simply a performer, but as a dual nominee for best supporting actress and best original song for Dee Rees\u2019 gripping post-World War II drama, Mudbound. It\u2019s a remarkable first-time feat for a first-time nominee; no other person has ever been nominated in an acting and song category for the same film.\n\nIn Mudbound, Blige plays Florence Jackson, the beleaguered but noble matriarch of a sharecropping family in rural Mississippi. Her stillness often anchors the film, riveting your attention to her every time she is on-screen. In the months since the film\u2019s release and growing Oscar buzz, Blige has spoken frequently about harnessing the power of her sadness from her ongoing divorce from former manager Kendu Isaacs for the role, as well as stripping down to play Florence Jackson. From Vulture:\n\nI\u2019m Mary J. Blige. I mean, like, this is what I do. I wear wigs, I wear bob wigs, and I had to completely strip down to my own natural hair texture, which I\u2019ve always been afraid of. Dee stripped me down all the way to what I truly am, and people were complimenting me. People were saying how beautiful I was. I didn\u2019t know I was that beautiful for real. You understand what I\u2019m saying? I didn\u2019t know that.\n\nTwo-time Emmy Award-winning hairstylist Lawrence Davis was instrumental in that transformational \u201cmakeunder,\u201d using both his extensive historical knowledge and incredible skill to render the Queen of Hip-Hop Soul almost unrecognizable to audiences at last year\u2019s Sundance Film Festival, where Mudbound premiered. Said director Rees: \u201cThe great surprise at Sundance was that people didn\u2019t know it was her until the credits rolled.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Derek Blanks\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIntrigued by the power of Blige\u2019s natural beauty, The Glow Up had the opportunity to talk with Davis about stripping down a megastar like Mary J. Blige, whom he describes as \u201cone of the shyest women on earth ... and so super-sweet.\u201d He tells us:\n\nI remember Mary\u2019s first day coming in for a camera test; I had specific directions from Dee Rees about how she wanted Mary just to strip down. She\u2019s like, \u201cI don\u2019t want wigs, I don\u2019t want this, I don\u2019t want that; I want it all organic.\u201d I said, \u201cYou got it.\u201d So Mary came in the trailer, and she sat in my chair, and we talked a little bit, as I was like, \u201cWell, I just need to get you to trust the process. Trust me to take you where you want to go, and if anything feels uncomfortable, we\u2019ll talk through it. So I [asked], \u2018Are you ready?\u2019 She\u2019s like, \u2018I\u2019m not taking my wig off in front of all these people!\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavis accommodated, clearing out the hair and makeup trailer to unmask the artist as well known for her assortment of blond coifs, lengthy manicures and thigh-high boots as for her hit-making urban ballads and bangers. Of course, Blige tried to negotiate her way into wearing a natural wig to play a sharecropper\u2019s wife, but Davis remained firm:\n\n\u201c\u2018No ... Dee wants you. She wants you to strip down,\u2019\u201d he told Blige. \u201c\u2018She don\u2019t want to see Mary; she wants to see Florence Jackson walk in there for this camera test.\u2019\u201d\n\nDavis ultimately won her trust, peeling back both wig and tracks of weave to reveal Blige\u2019s natural hair. Throughout Mudbound, audiences are seeing Blige\u2019s natural texture at work in creating humble updos and a single scene in which we see her shoulder-length hair hang free. While the star was leery at first, she soon succumbed to the process\u2014and the freedom that came from releasing the trappings of being Mary J. Blige. Says Davis:\n\nShe basically let herself go, and she became Florence right there in that trailer. And with that, it was just taking any hair she had on her head out\u2014no hair, no weave, no wig\u2014taking her nails off, her lashes off. Basically, you got organic Mary. And I would say about the second, third day, Mary was coming in the trailer full-on Afro, just totally free ... [A]nd I could definitely see that she had this freedom that she did not have day one from that point on. And with that, it just took me saying, \u201cYou\u2019re Florence Jackson.\u201d I said, \u201cFlorence, she\u2019s a woman\u2014she lives on a farm, but she takes care of herself. She washes her clothes, she washes her kids\u2019 clothes. She does the best with what she has; she\u2019s a groomed woman. She lives on a farm in the South in the \u201940s. But she takes care of herself and her family.\u201d And that\u2019s who Mary became; she became Florence Jackson.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMary J.

Blige in Mudbound (Netflix) Mary J. Blige and director Dee Rees working on Mudbound (Netflix) 1 / 8\n\nAs for the personal woes that Blige was admittedly experiencing during filming, Davis says he was unaware of the specifics at the time, but definitely noticed the emotional transformation that took place:\n\n[T]here were times when I could feel the heaviness\u2014but didn\u2019t know what it was. But I will say that I literally saw that heaviness go away as she got into this character, and she came in there every day and became Florence Jackson. She started talking more, and that heaviness that was there, it disappeared during this movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs lead hairstylist on Mudbound, Davis was entirely in his element. The Baltimore native has a specific affinity for period hairstyles and has previously flexed his knowledge and skills behind the scenes of era-specific projects like The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, Bessie and Hairspray Live!\u2014for which he won the second of his two Emmys.\n\nDavis got his start in his native city, owning his own salon before making the brave choice to sell it and move to Los Angeles in 2001. Halle Berry\u2019s then-stylist Neeko Abriol gave Davis a shot in his salon, and doors immediately began to open. He has since garnered 81 film and television credits, in addition to leading the hair teams of Being Mary Jane, Greenleaf and Claws. But it is the period pieces that remain his true passion. Case in point: His current project is styling Mahershala Ali into virtuoso pianist Don Shirley for the upcoming film Green Book. As Davis tells The Glow Up:\n\nI honestly feel like I\u2019ve been reincarnated, because as long as I remember\u2014even from being a young kid\u2014I gravitated toward anything that was vintage. Vintage cars, vintage clothing; I loved thrift stores because of the vintage clothing. And when I first got a call to do a period piece, I was most excited because it got to the root of what I wanted to do. You know, hairstyling is great, and I love it. But there\u2019s something that I\u2019m drawn to when it comes to period styling. I love the authenticity of it, and how it brings forth the story and tells the story without there even being any verbiage. You can look at the person and see where they\u2019re from, or what\u2019s going on with them because of maybe the economic setting, but just the style that they\u2019re adorned with\u2014the beautiful hair, the beautiful clothes, the beautiful makeup\u2014all of that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Derek Blanks\n\nBut, specifically, Davis loves working with the natural textures of black hair, and is emphatic that it be portrayed accurately on-screen. For him, there is an eternal elegance to natural hair. He believes that natural hairstyles belong in every film and on every red carpet because they are part of our legacy of style:\n\nBlack women, even before they started pressing their hair, they basically knew how to create these wonderful shapes out of natural hair; these silhouettes and things like that that speak elegance and class without pressing it out and going bone straight and having it go silky and shiny. It just was a beautiful, beautiful thing to see. ... But we definitely have the most beautiful hair to me on earth. And you know we wear it well, and I think that in any period movie\u2014no matter what period it is\u2014I think there always should be a black woman with natural hair. ... I just feel like black hair\u2014natural hair\u2014should always be a part of it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut if Davis is excited about the resurgence of natural hair on-screen and on the red carpet alike, he also loves that even black women who wear wigs are gravitating toward styles with more texture in them (e.g., Viola Davis\u2019 incredible Golden Globes look this year). He predicts that at the Oscars this Sunday and many to come, we may bring even more natural styles and braided updos to the step-and-repeat, and tells us:\n\nI think women are much more open to showing exactly, you know, what\u2019s under that wig as opposed to covering up nowadays. And I look at every award show and I always see somebody come forth and say, \u201cNo, this is who I am, and this is who I have been and I want to show it.\u201d ... I think that even when other races look at us and see us out there in our natural form, they love it, because it tells them how proud we are as a people and how proud we are to show what\u2019s natural about us, and what\u2019s unique about us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly how Davis thinks it should be. For him, natural hair has always been far more than just a trend or a movement: \u201cJust call it us. ... I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a movement anymore; I just think it is reality. It\u2019s who we are, and we\u2019re proud of it.\u201d", "keywords": ["mudbound", "natural", "florence", "hair", "hiphop", "netflix", "davis", "soul", "unmaking", "lawrence", "j", "blige", "mary", "talks", "beautiful", "hairstylist", "queen"], "polarity": 0.2369808449695669, "subjectivity": 0.49995972073039713},

It\u2019s the lady up the street who takes lunch and dinner soul food orders and the brotha with bootleg movies stopping through on a Saturday morning; the gospel music in some spots and the hip-hop or trap music in others. It\u2019s generations of women from one family either working in the shop or getting their hair done in that same shop. For many black women, the shop is a second home where we create family ties through nurturing our hair.\n\n\n\nWhen I saw Chris Rock\u2019s 2009 documentary Good Hair, I was surprised to learn that black hair care is a multibillion-dollar business. Most of us don\u2019t think about those numbers; what\u2019s always been most important to me\u2014as I\u2019m sure it is for other folks\u2014is to find a shop that aesthetically makes me feel comfortable and at home. I want to be in a place where the business practices are exceptional and the stylist cares about my hair. But for me, the black beauty shop experience is also complicated by my identities as a lesbian, butch woman and a black/biracial person.\n\nI grew up in the black church\u2014which meant long services, skeevy deacons, wilding-out preachers\u2019 kids (PKs) and older women who absolutely ran the church, regardless of the pastor. But one of the things I remember most from my religious education is that a woman\u2019s hair is her \u201ccrowning glory,\u201d which meant you had to be very cautious about how you cut or styled your hair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a kid, I had thick, curly locks that at one point extended down to my butt. People gushed over my hair, but quite frankly, I hated it. I never quite understood what to do with it, and it never held a relaxer like my friends\u2019 hair did.\n\nAs I got older, I felt even more alienated from black beauty shops because of my own relationship with race. I was adopted into a black family, so I had a clear understanding of my blackness from a very young age. But it wasn\u2019t until I was older that I began to explore the nuances of being light-skinned, black and also biracial. The push and pull of being accepted by black folk who weren\u2019t sure whether I was \u201cblack enough\u201d felt constant. And that push and pull extended to the relationship I had with my hair, and my identity as a butch woman.\n\nFor me, long hair was not part of my butch identity. It indicated a femininity that felt uncomfortable, and I needed a stylist and salon that understood and respected that. The choice to cut my hair was the most liberating feeling I\u2019d ever experienced, aside from coming out to the world and myself. But it took a long time for me to find the right person and the right shop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019ve been in hair salons with a heavy evangelical Christian energy, where people consider Harry Potter \u201cblack magic\u201d and implore folks to beware of the churches with rainbow flags, because that\u2019s where \u201cthose people\u201d go to church.\n\nI\u2019ve been in salons where the stylist criticized my hair just for being my hair. I\u2019ve been in salons where I was simply a number in a chair. And, of course, we\u2019ve all had a salon experience where your appointment is at 9 a.m. and you don\u2019t get out of the chair until 5 p.m.\n\nAt a certain point, I knew I needed a place with a mixture of great energy, client-centered service and stylists who wanted me to love my hair as much as they loved doing hair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was lucky to find Consciously Beautiful salon in St. Paul, Minn., through a friend who wears her hair natural in intricate braided styles. My relationship with stylist and owner Marla Smith is intense and intimate; she knows me almost as well as my partner of 18 years.\n\nShe was the first stylist to tell me that my hair has an actual identity (spiral corkscrew 3a), and the only stylist to identify my partner\u2019s formerly inflamed scalp as a sign of lactose intolerance and recommend that she lay off dairy for a while. Recently, she recommended that I use a little coconut oil before adding product so that my hair doesn\u2019t dry out in the harsh Minnesota winter.\n\nMarla says she decided to go into hair care because she wanted to do something she could be passionate about. And though she loves black women\u2019s hair, her clientele is diverse and spans different types of identities and people. And most importantly, her spot is a place that has great healing energy. Every month, I leave her spot relaxed, rejuvenated and filled with joy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know there are women who work in barbershops, and butch lesbians and straight women alike who get their hair cut in barbershops, but my personal politic is that I don\u2019t belong in black barbershops. There are so few places where black men are able to be vulnerable with one another that it just doesn\u2019t feel right for me to be there.\n\nBut I\u2019ve also had plenty of moments where I felt out of place in black beauty shops. I\u2019ve often felt like I was eavesdropping on black women\u2019s vulnerability in a space where femme black women have felt their safest to talk about their partners, their children, their relationships with their mothers and other women in their lives, and maybe\u2014at their most raucous\u2014whether they should be the first one to text their new love back after a night of getting their backs blown out.\n\nMy place in black beauty shops has often been fraught with deciding what part of my identity must take precedence over the other. At this point in my life, I feel lucky I no longer have to worry about that, but that\u2019s not the case for every butch woman. Understanding our place within black and primarily femme women\u2019s spaces can be complicated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I love the scents of black beauty salons and the energy of black women. We are divine, complex individuals\u2014even in our most hood and ratchet moments\u2014and in those spaces, we find ways to make joy and community.\n\nThankfully, I\u2019ve found a space\u2014a space where my stylist literally and figuratively weaves magic\u2014where I don\u2019t have to decide which of my identities gets to show up. For Marla, I am Stephanie: black/biracial, butch, lesbian, a client she respects, and whose success she roots for.

The three-time Academy Award nominee, who won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for 2016\u2019s Fences\u201a is a regular on the awards circuit and is often called the \u201cblack Meryl Streep\u201d\u2014to which she rightly responds, \u201c[then] pay me what I\u2019m worth.\u201d\n\n\n\nIndeed, it\u2019s Davis\u2019 frank, fearless and unfailing honesty\u2014in her acting roles, her rising visibility as an advocate for equal rights and pay, and her willingness to talk about her own experiences of poverty and sexual abuse\u2014that has so endeared her to us.\n\nSo it\u2019s no surprise that Davis didn\u2019t hold back when speaking to digital magazine Porter Edit about the game-changing opportunity that came with playing Annalise Keating, the character that elevated her from supporting film roles into a leading\u2014and sexually liberated\u2014lady of television drama:\n\nI\u2019m 52 and darker than a paper bag. Women who look like me are relegated to the back of the bus, auditioning for crackheads and mammas and the person with a hand on her hip who is always described as \u2018sassy\u2019 or \u2018soulful\u2019. I\u2019ve had a 30-year career and I have rarely gotten roles that are fleshed out, even a little bit. I mean, you wouldn\u2019t think [these characters] have a vagina. Annalise Keating has changed the game. I don\u2019t even care if she doesn\u2019t make sense. I love that she\u2019s unrestricted, that every week I actually have to fight [showrunner] Peter Nowalk not to have another love scene. When does that ever happen?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat liberation has also been a revelation for Davis, who had to tap into a previously unexplored aspect of her tremendous talent to be free enough to play a woman in touch with her own sexuality and desire. Part of that process was realizing that sexiness doesn\u2019t only come in one package:\n\n... because very rarely in my career \u2013 and in my life \u2013 have I been allowed to explore that part of myself, to be given permission to know that is an aspect of my humanity, that I desire and am desired. I always felt in playing sexuality you have to look a certain way, to be a certain size, to walk a certain way. Until I realized that what makes people lean in is when they see themselves. There\u2019s no way I am going to believe that all women who are sexualized are size zero or two, all have straight hair, all look like sex kittens every time they go to bed and want sex from their man, all are heterosexual. I am mirroring women. I always say it is not my job to be sexy, it\u2019s my job to be sexual. That\u2019s the difference.\n\nDavis goes on to discuss the wage gap in Hollywood, referencing the recent move by actress Jessica Chastain to ensure that she and her Oscar-winning co-star Octavia Spencer would make equal pay on their next film together. Says Davis: \u201cCaucasian women have to stand in solidarity with us. And they have to understand we are not in the same boat.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd as both a Hollywood heavyweight and a survivor of sexual abuse, when asked if the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements would have gained momentum if brought forward by women of color, she is emphatically clear:\n\nNo. Recy Taylor came forward in 1944 when she was gang raped by six men in Alabama. Tarana Burke was the founder of the #MeToo movement in 2006. There are plenty of black women who have come forward. I don\u2019t think people feel we deserve the same empathy. Or investment. We are not as valued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavis has plenty more to say on the hypocrisy of Hollywood and how she navigates it as a black woman.

Since I was 18-years-old, I\u2019ve been surrounded by Black people who are actively involved in STEM fields. I have several friends with STEM PhDs, including one who writes for VSB on occasion. Two of my closest friends in life are PhDs in biomedical engineering/biology and psychometrics, I have several friends with math PhDs, a few with chemistry PhDs, I even know some physics PhDs. Not to mention the numbers of medical doctors I personally know. They\u2019re all very brilliant, regular people and fixtures in my life.\n\nTo say that I live in a bubble of Black excellence would be an understatement, but it\u2019s true. I wrote about this some time ago after Damon and I attended Yale\u2019s Black Solidarity Conference in February and came across this young woman who had never seen a Black PhD before. She is in college majoring in some STEM major. It gave me the sads. I might still have those sads.\n\nI recently wrote about my TI-83 graphing calculator and being in a pre-freshman summer program for STEM majors at Morehouse. We had a counterpart program at Spelman College (thy name we praise) called WISE, or Women In Science and Engineering, also (I believe) funded by NASA.\n\nI just used 203 words to basically state that Black mathematicians and scientists aren\u2019t anything new to me, regardless of gender. So when I see movies like Hidden Figures it serves to reinforce the things that I, personally, know and can attest to: Black folks been doing the damn thing like beavers for a while now.\n\nBut what I also have to do is take a step outside of my own bubble and realize that, apparently, for a vast many of people, Black, white, or other, the world that I call normal is actually pretty small and potentially anomalous, which is exactly why movies like Hidden Figures are important.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs you know by now, Hidden Figures is a movie that explores the roles several (and I do mean SEVERAL) Black women played in the early stages of America\u2019s quest to get a man into outer space. It specifically tells an abbreviated story of Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson, three Black women mathematicians who worked at NASA\u2019s Langley facility in Virginia in separate roles that were vital to the early space missions. Katherine Johnson (played by Taraji P. Henson) is especially vital in the movie as she\u2019s the woman whose calculations SPECIFICALLY ensured America wouldn\u2019t lose in the space race with Russia.\n\nThe movie is based on a true story, and sadly a story I had NO clue existed until the promotions for Hidden Figures began earlier this year. We are all aware that Black women\u2019s contributions are often downplayed if not altogether erased when it comes to the struggle for civil rights in this country no matter the era, but I\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t EXTREMELY frustrated by how much I learned about these pivotal women, and women like them, by watching this movie.\n\nTo know that there was an entire group of women period, but especially Black women, all of extraordinary intelligence and acumen, working at NASA ensuring the continuation of the early space program and having ZERO idea about their contributions is exactly why we need to support movies like this. It helps that it\u2019s actually a good movie (though long, and that\u2019s what she said) and that Janelle Monae (as Mary Jackson) and Octavia Spencer (as Dorothy Vaughan), as well as Taraji, are magnificent on screen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, there are definitely several moments that are specifically designed to make you clap or say \u201cAmen\u201d even though I\u2019m pretty sure they didn\u2019t happen exactly how presented. There are several speeches that seem a little bit too on the nose, though they are very important for moving along the greater point about discrimination Black women faced due to both their color and sex. But those a-little-bit-too-perfect moments don\u2019t detract from the greater good and greater lessons to be learned from watching this movie: Black women are excelling everywhere, even in places where history tries to tell you they weren\u2019t.\n\nMy daughter wants to be a scientist when she grows up. She\u2019s not sure exactly what kind yet, and sometimes she wants to be a doctor and a scientist and a songwriter and a spy. Part of this desire is that many of the television shows for kids now feature kids, and girls specifically, who are conducting experiments and using their brains to change the world or whatever. I\u2019m glad that my daughter can watch KC Undercover or Doc McStuffins and see girls of color being who she wants to be without any obstacle or roadblock. Because of those television shows, my daughter\u2019s imagination is wide open.\n\nBut I definitely want my daughter to see Hidden Figures; that way, she can see why shows like KC Undercover or Doc McStuffins exist. She needs to know that these smart Black women took no prisoners and used the gifts they were blessed with to excel even if took 50 years for their stories to hit the mainstream. Our history is everything.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo many contributions of people of color have been overlooked, and Hidden Figures puts that fact front and center. Specifically, the roles of Black women in every facet of the furthering of our community are often relegated to background roles or plot devices. It\u2019s a nice change of pace to see a movie headed up by a group of Black women about a group of Black women who not only excelled, but excelled in a world most people think is only inhabited by (white) men.\n\nI realize that many women have a complicated relationship with the term \u201cBlack girl magic\u201d and for various understandable reasons. But it is the term I thought of while watching the movie. No they\u2019re not unicorns, just Black women doing the work that Black women have been doing for eons and fighting a fight that many of us fail to acknowledge, including some Black men who sometimes present ourselves as an additional foe. The Black women in this movie are brilliant mathematicians who paved the way for those women that I know who never realized that being a math major wasn\u2019t an option. And the world is a better place for it.\n\nHidden Figures? I\u2019m glad we found them.

Henson. Seriously, the woman so regularly kills it on the red carpet, we\u2019re ready to nickname her Buffy the Couture Slayer. At last night\u2019s Academy Awards, she certainly lived up to the moniker, putting her own slightly gothic spin on the goddess-inspired trend that threatened to take over the red carpet.\n\nWearing a sleek bob styled by Tymothe Wallace and a Vera Wang couture gown chosen by stylist Jason Bolden (who also dressed Ava DuVernay this Oscar weekend), the actress showed off her famously toned body with yards of chiffon, sheer paneling and an up-to-there slit, flashing us a gleaming length of leg throughout the evening\u2019s festivities.\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images)\n\nAnd because we never tire of an epic slay here at The Glow Up, when we heard that Henson\u2019s longtime makeup artist Ashunta Sheriff was dishing on the star\u2019s look last night, we naturally wanted the goods. I mean ... who wouldn\u2019t?\n\nFun fact: As both a model and, later, a first-time Grammy nominee, I was blessed to have my face polished to perfection by Ashunta Sheriff. I can personally attest that she is a master of her craft, and a makeup maven who makes contouring a breeze with the first-ever dual-ended foundation stick from her collection, Ashunta Sheriff Beauty. She\u2019s also generous enough to share her expertise: Time spent in her chair is as educational as it is beautifying!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images)\n\nOn that note, here\u2019s our favorite secret to how Sheriff created Henson\u2019s Oscar slay: Several components can be found right in your local drusgtore aisle. For instance, like Issa Rae\u2019s Golden Globes makeup artist, Joanna Simkin, Sheriff looked no further than a reliable household name to make sure Henson\u2019s skin took center stage last night. As she shared with The Glow Up:\n\n1. \u201cBecause Taraji\u2019s dress was Grecian and flowy and showed lots of skin, I wanted to make sure she was glowing and moisturized from head to toe! I used Vaseline Intensive Care Cocoa Radiant Lotion, made with deep healing moisturizers and Vaseline jelly; it was the perfect choice to show off her healthy, luminous skin.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. \u201cTo start off her makeup, I used Fenty Beauty by Rihanna Pro Filt\u2019r Instant Retouch Primer. Then Perfect Blend by Ashunta Sheriff, a dual-ended foundation and concealer that helps you get even in one step. Perfect Blend is the first dual-ended foundation and helps to tone down redness. The formula feels lightweight and wears like a second skin, giving you medium to buildable coverage. I used the shade medium for a natural soft coverage.\n\n\n\n3. \u201cFor Taraji\u2019s already amazing cheekbones, I used my fingertips for a softening effect to highlight, using Danessa Myricks Enlight Illuminator powder in Confidence. Its super-pigmented shimmer is my favorite. I contoured using Cozette S145 Perfect Contour brush and Cozette Infinite Contour Palette to sculpt cheekbones.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. \u201cFor the eyes, I used Kiss Beauty Blowout Lashes in Pixie. These lashes are perfect for sexy and soft looks; plus, Kiss makes affordable lashes that are comparable to high-end brands. I placed lashes close to Taraji\u2019s lash line, then created a thin line using Kiss Waterproof Wonders precision-point eye liner to create definition. I always marry faux lashes and real lashes with Kiss Mascara in Black.\n\n\n\n5. \u201cLastly, I finished the look off with lip liner in MAC Cork and filled in her lips as well, for longevity\u2014layering ensures the color lasts longer. To finish the lip, I applied the Lip Bar Liquid Matte Creme in Savage and Drama Queen.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAshunta Sheriff and Taraji P. Henson are clearly a match made in makeup heaven\u2014after all, what better color to use on Henson than \u201cDrama Queen\u201d? Henson certainly brought the drama last night, and with a slay game this consistent, we\u2019re not sure which we\u2019re more excited about: the Oscar-nominated actress\u2019s next film, or her next appearance on the red carpet!", "keywords": ["oscars", "slays", "using", "red", "henson", "kiss", "carpetagain", "taraji", "ashunta", "sheriff", "makeup", "tarajis", "perfect", "p", "glow", "lashes", "used"], "polarity": 0.1809403559403559, "subjectivity": 0.46866489991489985},

Sitting there in the theater, gazing up at the gorgeous Dora Milaje, the thought occurred to you at least once: Could I pull off a bald head?\n\nPhoto: Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nMaybe your answer was an immediate and unequivocal \u201cNo,\u201d but if there was even a glimmer of curiosity, let\u2019s dig into it. While women have been rocking baldies and fades for centuries now, our hair is often still considered our \u201ccrowning glory.\u201d But is the crown really what\u2019s on your head, or what\u2019s in it?\n\nWith the ongoing popularity of Marvel\u2019s Black Panther, we got not only an eyeful of epic black excellence and battle scenes, but also a bevy of bald beauties, courtesy of Wakanda\u2019s royal guard, the Dora Milaje, led by General Okoye (played by Danai Gurira), who sports not only a clean-shaven head but a tattooed one.\n\nMuch to our delight, long after shooting wrapped, Gurira continued to have fun with the look in real life; even taking to having designs etched into her reverse bald fade, which she rocked to glamorous effect at the Black Panther European premiere.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Gareth Cattermole (Getty Images for Disney)\n\nBut for those of us who aren\u2019t starring in the latest Hollywood blockbuster, is this a look we can realistically pull off? To find out, we reached out to one of our favorite bald beauties, psychiatrist and occasional contributor to The Root, Dr. Imani J. Walker.\n\n\n\nWalker began shaving her head at about the age of 17 while an incoming freshman at Xavier University in New Orleans. Originally arriving at school with the popular \u201990s-era permed-and-cropped cut made famous by Halle Berry, Walker tells The Glow Up that she quickly found the need for a drastic change:\n\nSo, I got down to New Orleans, and it was like 90-something degrees and 120 percent humidity, and my hair was just\u2014I was like, \u201cThis isn\u2019t happening. I\u2019m not looking cute right now.\u201d And then, my roommate at the time, when we met, we had the exact same haircut. And I was like, OK; out of necessity and also because I just hate doing what everybody else is doing, I just cut it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat \u201cbig chop\u201d led to what has become Walker\u2019s trademark look for the past 25 years, a gleaming bald head she shaves every other day. A very active mom and wife on top of her duties as a doctor, she credits her choice of hairstyle\u2014or lack thereof\u2014with making her busy lifestyle simpler.\n\nI\u2019m fairly active\u2014I work out a good six, if not seven, days a week. So one of the things I really love about it is the fact that it\u2019s not, there\u2019s not anything that I have to really be concerned about ... but also on top of that, [if I\u2019m] jumping in the pool, or I\u2019m the middle of the street and the wind blows, it feels really just nice. It\u2019s just a really refreshing feeling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWalker also admits to us that her personal affinity for baldness is as psychological as it is physical:\n\n\n\nI guess, spiritually speaking, I\u2019ve always felt the need [for] my thoughts to be as close to the air as possible; I just need to feel like I have freedom of thought. And for me, that physically just means having the freedom to be able to have my scalp exposed to as many elements possible. But I think more than anything, I like the way it feels, and it just so happens to look good.\n\nBut Walker warns that while lower maintenance, choosing to go bald doesn\u2019t mean no maintenance. She indulges in a strict skin and scalp regimen to keep her look smooth and free of razor bumps, emphasizing that \u201cyou have to give it as much thought as you would give any type of hairstyle.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow does she keep her dome glowing? By taking extreme care with the tools and products she uses. \u201cYou can\u2019t just take Barbasol shaving cream or some plastic cheap razor and just go to your head; you\u2019ll destroy your scalp,\u201d she warns. \u201cYou\u2019ll have razor bumps forever, and it\u2019s not going to be cute.\u201d\n\nTo keep her close shave extra-cute, Walker has her routine down to a science:\n\nFirst, using a barber-grade Wahl trimmer, like the GroomsMan T-Pro, specially made to give a bump-free shave, Walker shaves her entire head.\n\n\n\nNext, she goes over her head with a set of clippers\u2014she likes Wahl\u2019s Ultra Close Cut Pro, crafted specifically for close shaves but less likely to cause razor bumps. While, technically, she has a very close shave, Walker says, \u201cTo the naked eye, it looks like my head is shining.\u201d\n\nAfter shaving, Walker oil cleanses her scalp, stressing that she treats her scalp the way she treats her face, first applying an oil cleanser that she wipes off with a hot washcloth, followed by a turmeric mask to her face and scalp, which helps to decrease inflammation, and does double duty against pimples and razor bumps. Walker\u2019s homemade mask includes turmeric powder, yogurt, rosewater and lemon juice.\n\nOnce out the shower, she applies a toner with salicylic acid, which she says is \u201cvery exciting in a tingling, like, \u2018Oh my God,\u2019 kind of a way\u2014but the tingle at least lets me know that it works!\u201d Afterward, she recommends using a hydrocortisone or steroid cream on the scalp to help nip any inflammation or razor bumps in the bud.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWalker follows this regimen religiously, shaving only every other day to cut down on irritation and get the best results.\n\nBut while Walker absolutely loves her look, she admits that she\u2019s used to getting stares from those who are unaccustomed to seeing a bald woman, which is why it was so refreshing to see the similarly styled Dora Milaje on-screen.\n\n\u201cI went to go see the movie with my son, and we talked a little bit about it after the movie, and he was like, \u2018Well, yeah, it\u2019s like an army of my mom. This is great ... it\u2019s like having my mom, but, like, 10 of them. This is amazing.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd for those who think a woman going bald compromises her femininity, the doctor has this to say:\n\nFemininity to a lot of people equates with being soft. Femininity to me is the ability to have the option to be soft\u2014the option to be whatever you want\u2014but more importantly, it\u2019s to be a woman and powerful. So I feel very feminine with my head shaved ... I\u2019d feel less feminine if I wore a wig or if my bald head were not on display every day. This is my head. I do what I want to do with it. And if they don\u2019t like it, that\u2019s not really my problem. ... But anybody who doesn\u2019t feel that this look is feminine, I think, needs to really re-evaluate what their insecurities are, and why they would feel the need to place their insecurities on someone else.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd because Walker isn\u2019t the only bald baddie in our midst, we did a little roundup of a few of our other favorite beauties who\u2019ve dared to go bare\u2014or, at least, almost there.\n\nFlorence Kasumba attends the European premiere of Black Panther in London Feb. 8, 2018.

But that said, we know it\u2019s not a look every woman can pull off, as Walker aptly notes:\n\nI mean, it\u2019s not for everyone. I do think that everyone should try it, but it\u2019s not necessarily for everyone, because not [everyone\u2019s head] is necessarily evenly shaped. People have asked me \u201cWell, how did you know what your head was going to look like?\u201d I don\u2019t know, I just did it. Just do it. Just try it and see. The worst-case scenario, your hair is going to grow back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, what do you say? Do you dare to go bare?

Now my hair is a few inches past my shoulders and longer and thicker than it ever was when it was relaxed.\n\n\n\nI give all the glory in my natural-hair journey to Lenelle Howell, the person who convinced me to go natural, but who is also the person who used to give me relaxers. I know I\u2019m supposed to give all glory to God, but as a black woman (and an agnostic), the closest thing I know to a deity is Lenelle, my hairdresser. She is my alpha and omega. My comforter in times of need. She is my rock in a weary land, and often\u2014when she finishes a new hairdo\u2014I have screamed \u201cHallelujah\u201d and done a Holy Ghost dance.\n\nI met Lenelle in 2010 when I was in an abusive relationship\u2014with my hair. My strands were broken, abused and in desperate need of some tender loving care. While it sometimes takes stylists a few weeks to get the hang of what a client desires, she immediately knew how to transform my sad-ass strands into something happy and manageable.\n\nInitially, I would wash my hair during off-weeks and have her do my touch-ups, occasionally treating myself to a simple wash-and-set (if I was feeling like a rich bitch). Soon it became painfully obvious which weeks she did my hair and which weeks I did, so eventually I decided not to derail her efforts to make my hair healthy and became a pampered weekly client.\n\nI consistently received compliments on my hair, and my Lenelle addiction got so bad that I\u2019d fly to my out-of-town job during the week and fly home simply to have her do work on my locks. She was like my dealer\u2014I\u2019m now convinced that\u2019s why they call it getting one\u2019s hair \u201cfixed.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am not sure when Lenelle and I crossed over from client and stylist to friends, but we did. She wasn\u2019t just my hair\u2019s caretaker; she provided me with an outlet that facilitated my emotional health on so many days. But shortly after she convinced me to adopt the natural-hair lifestyle (ugh ... I can\u2019t believe I just wrote that), I moved from Orlando, Fla., to Atlanta. Atlanta probably has more natural hairstylists per capita than any other place in the country, but none of them was my hairstylist. It was only after my big move that I realized the space Lenelle occupied in my life, and how much I missed her.\n\nRecently we were on the phone for about a half an hour, but only about five minutes of the conversation centered on my hair. We talked about career, men and life; we caught up like I was sitting in her chair. She said something that really resonated with me: \u201cKyla, people don\u2019t know how sensitive you truly are.\u201d\n\nShe wasn\u2019t talking about my hair.\n\nShe would know. She\u2019s seen me completely break down in her chair when my amour du jour wasn\u2019t acting right. She\u2019s seen me in slumps of feeling unlovable, unappreciated and unsure of my next move in life. She\u2019s been my hairdresser from when I was doing poetry as an out-of-control hobby to when it became my full-time job. She\u2019s been a career counselor, a psychologist and a newfound sister.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor black women, the salon has always been a staple of the community, second only to the black church. Beauty salons and barbershops are the institutional centerpieces of black neighborhoods. They are where people talk politics, get the latest \u201ctea,\u201d network, organize community events and even patronize smaller businesses. If you\u2019re having a party or a protest and you need black people\u2019s help, just go to where they\u2019re getting their hair done.\n\nConsider that Madam C.J. Walker, one of the first black millionaires, was a woman selling hair-care products, and that today, black women spend about nine times as much as their nonblack counterparts on hair-care products, it is safe to say that hair is important to black women. The black hairdresser is the high priestess and No. 1 practitioner of #BlackGirlMagic. She can take the homeliest-looking woman and transform her into a veritable snack. Voil\u00e0\u2014magic!\n\nNot only does a black hairdresser have to be dexterously skilled, but she\u2019s also the gatekeeper to intimate secrets. She is the protector, with \u201cWatch out, I\u2019ve heard about him\u201d certainty. She laughs when it\u2019s time to laugh, and heals when it is time to heal, all while standing on her feet all day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe black salon is a transformation chamber, home to hourly Cinderella stories, where black women can forget the pressures of the world\u2014even if they have to sacrifice hot-ass ears under the dryer.\n\nAfter Lenelle\u2019s intervention, my locks are now out of detox and doing much better. Having natural hair has admittedly saved me a lot of time and money, while making my hair much healthier than when I was addicted to the creamy crack. In the past year, I\u2019ve only gone to the salon twice.\n\nBut I miss my weekly therapy sessions with my counselor. I miss the ritual of sitting on Lenelle\u2019s altar to receive her healing blessings. I miss the safe space of being surrounded by women laughing and sharing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI miss my friend.", "keywords": ["miss", "surviving", "shes", "going", "know", "natural", "lenelle", "hair", "ive", "missed", "weeks", "breakup", "women", "black", "hairdresser", "woman"], "polarity": 0.06577585377585381, "subjectivity": 0.4640754208754209},

Specifically, she wants me to take her vitamins, which is why a month\u2019s supply of multivitamins from her company, Movita Organics, sits on my desk. The glass bottle boasts that they are made with organic fruit, vegetables and herbs, whole-food vitamins and minerals, and are gluten-free, non-GMO and allergen-free for shellfish and nuts. But for me, the biggest selling point was that I could take them on an empty stomach, which I have been, every morning for the past two weeks.\n\nHow do I feel? Pretty damn good, for someone who averages five hours of sleep per night.\n\nI\u2019m guessing this proprietary blend must be where Tonya Lewis Lee gets the energy to keep so many balls in the air\u2014and look great doing it. After all, the attorney, film and television producer, writer, health advocate, public speaker, blogger and now vitamin entrepreneur is also mother to two grown children and has been married to prolific and legendary director Spike Lee since 1993.\n\nAnd Movita isn\u2019t even her only current project: Aside from her own writing projects, her production company, Tonik Productions, is currently in distribution talks for its critically acclaimed film Monster, which premiered at this year\u2019s Sundance Film Festival and stars Jeffrey Wright and Jennifer Hudson. It\u2019s just one of multiple film and television projects the company has pending; and then, of course, she\u2019s also executive producer (and rumored inspiration) for Netflix\u2019s successful serial reboot of her husband\u2019s first feature film, She\u2019s Gotta Have It.\n\nAdd to that her health-and-wellness blog, Healthy You Now, and her numerous speaking engagements around the country on issues of women\u2019s and infant health, and you\u2019ve got one very full, very multifaceted life. Here at The Glow Up, all we want to know is: How does she do it? Lewis Lee graciously took time out from her busy schedule to tell us:\n\nYou know, it\u2019s funny, because I think sometimes for people it can sound like, \u201cOh, she has so many different things.\u201d But for me, they all come out of the same place, meaning that they come from a place of really wanting to ultimately tell stories around who we are as a people\u2014and particularly black people\u2014but also, black people living in an integrated world. And the health piece to me is so clear because I believe that we\u2019re all here for a purpose and a reason, and you can\u2019t really fulfill your purpose or your reason if you don\u2019t have your health. And so, for me, the vitamins are a way to continue the conversation with women around how to live your best life, how to be as healthy as you possibly can be, and to keep those conversations and stories going, as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLewis Lee\u2019s recent venture into the vitamin market is part of advancing that conversation. Movita Organics launched with its women\u2019s multivitamin (which retails at a competitive $39.95 per bottle for a incomparable list of benefits), but has several other products ready for market, including a prenatal vitamin, B3 and B12, as well as a hair, skin and nails formulation we can\u2019t wait to get our hands on.\n\nBut if a high-end multivitamin seems a trivial pursuit in comparison with the real health crises facing our communities, Lewis Lee is well-versed on those issues as well, traveling the country to engage with and inform women of all backgrounds about ways to achieve optimal health for themselves, their families and their communities:\n\n\n\nOne of the things I\u2019ve done when I have gone and spoken at different outlets is to bring together people from that particular community to talk about the issues; about what are the barriers to optimal health in their communities, and how can we seek to make the situation better? ... Because I do think that when you share information\u2014even if what\u2019s happening in my community is a little different [from] what\u2019s going on in yours\u2014that shared information can be helpful. Again, because it\u2019s not just an individual choice; it is about our community as well, and getting our communities to support healthy lifestyles, especially in this onslaught that we are dealing with our government right now. So I hope to go offline as well, and bring people together to have these conversations and try to make our communities as healthy as they can be.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Keith Major\n\nNow that she\u2019s moving into making health-based products, Lewis Lee is garnering obvious comparisons to other lifestyle mavens\u2014her blog has even been called \u201cthe black Goop.\u201d But Lewis Lee is clear that her mission is to create and cultivate a healthy lifestyle culture made for us, by us:\n\n\n\nWhen I initially started my blog, Healthy You Now, the idea was to provide a platform that was creating content that would help women find answers and ... ways to live a better, healthier lifestyle. And we also were trying to create a community of women, because I think that a lot of times we feel like we\u2019re out here on our own, trying to figure these issues out. But when you hear other people\u2019s journeys, it\u2019s helpful to know that you\u2019re not alone ...\n\nIt is about a community of women with tools to help them live their best lives. And as women of color, we certainly deserve and need space for ourselves as well ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s an ambitious undertaking, but clearly, Lewis Lee is no stranger to ambition. Neither is she the prototypical \u201cHollywood wife\u201d; even during the years she focused on raising her family in her native New York, she always kept her own career at what she calls a \u201csimmer.\u201d But while it would be easy to assume that she\u2019s gotta have it all, Lewis Lee chuckles at the concept:\n\nYou know, I\u2019m a believer that you can have it all, but not necessarily all at the same time. And it\u2019s hard; I am very fortunate in that I married someone who was able to provide while we were raising our children. I did keep working, but ... I made the choice that my children were going to come first, and I was able to work around what worked for them. [But] I always had a vision that by the time my son\u2014who\u2019s my youngest\u2014graduated from high school, I\u2019d still be a relatively young woman, and I could really go hard in my career. ... I was able to do that, and once they were out of the house, I was then able to shift gears and go really hard, which is really amazing. And I am so grateful to be able to be in that position. So I would say to women: You have to make choices that work for your family. You have to make your choices, but I do believe as women, no matter what your circumstances, you have to have something for yourself. And even if you have to keep it at simmer\u2014if you can\u2019t do it 100 percent\u2014you should do something so that when the time comes ... you can shift gears and go 100 percent... I think that for our own self-esteem, we do have to be engaged in working at something other than our children, so that when they do grow up\u2014and they do grow up faster than we think\u2014you\u2019ve got something for yourself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLewis Lee credits great partnerships in every area of her life with her ability to juggle it all, as well as the ability to pivot when things aren\u2019t working out. But most of all, she thinks the secret to her ongoing motivation and success is figuring out what she loves to do, and continuing to do it:", "keywords": ["multifaceted", "vitamins", "really", "mama", "healthy", "community", "health", "film", "women", "motivator", "tonya", "lee", "able", "great", "lewis"], "polarity": 0.22339749536178108, "subjectivity": 0.5181294725682479},

Many of us are just now learning their names: Katherine Johnson, Mary Jackson and Dorothy Vaughn.\n\nSo much of our history has been omitted from the curricula of many schools. That's a huge chunk of the foundation of racism that our country is built on. It's the reason that the three women who are highlighted in Hidden Figures, as well as the many black women who worked right alongside them and many others, have been ignored by history. It's the reason that today, some 54 years later, we still have to proclaim that black lives matter when we see evidence right in front of our eyes that says they don't.\n\nAstronaut John Glenn's orbit around Earth in 1962 was called one of the most important flights in U.S. history, and it no doubt is. NASA even says that because of that mission, Glenn \"became a national hero and a symbol of American ambition.\" And yet there was no mention of the numbers that made the mission successful, or that the only numbers Glenn trusted were Johnson's.\n\nAt a press conference for Hidden Figures, Taraji P. Henson, who plays Johnson, said, \u201cWhen you\u2019re playing a person who\u2019s real, there\u2019s a responsibility to get it right. As soon as I signed on, I asked if she was still alive. I had to meet her immediately.\u201d Johnson and her family were delighted not only to meet the superstar but also to have her play the beloved matriarch, who is now 98 years old.\n\nAnd while Henson felt that she was in the presence of a queen-and-superhero hybrid, it was Johnson's humility that floored her. Johnson told Henson that it's just the way things were and she just wanted to do her job and do it well. Henson was blown away, as we will be with her performance. Taraji P. Henson becomes Katherine Johnson\u2014embodying struggle and flight.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOctavia Spencer, who portrays Vaughn, was the first to sign on to the hefty project, and she just knew she needed to be a part of it. So of course the director, Theodore \u201cTed\u201d Melfi, locked the Oscar-winning actress in. At the Hidden Figures press conference, of her portrayal of Vaughn, she said, \"There\u2019s enough negative images of black women out there. I didn\u2019t want to portray her in some stereotype. I wanted to make sure her integrity was preserved.\u201d\n\nThese heroes' images are not only preserved but reinvigorated. These women will help future generations defy the world's limitations. Margot Shetterly, the author of the book Hidden Figures, which was being produced the same time as the movie, says that her mission was to expand the idea of what black women were capable of. \"They went to work and brought their A game. They did our country and women a great service. They are the American dream,\" Shetterly says.\n\nThis is a history lesson we all deserve. Knowing that black women were the backbone of one of the biggest space missions in America is knowing that we can be anything. It's knowing that #BlackGirlMagic is an actual trait in our DNA that allows us to excel gracefully. It's knowing that even when we're \"hidden figures,\" we're still there, making our mark.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCheck out the trailer:", "keywords": ["hidden", "henson", "johnson", "right", "upholds", "mission", "figures", "knowing", "legacy", "changed", "history", "women", "extraordinary", "black", "world"], "polarity": 0.14494047619047615, "subjectivity": 0.49054232804232795},

I mean, we know she\u2019s an Oakland, Calif., native, and a child model-turned-Disney starlet. We know she appeared on Dancing With the Stars before scoring the coveted role of M.J. in the latest installment of the Spider-Man franchise. We even know she\u2019s also a singer whose 2014 single \u201cReplay\u201d hit No. 40 on the Billboard charts, and most recently she sang while swinging on a flying trapeze in Hugh Jackman\u2019s latest film, the Oscar-nominated The Greatest Showman.\n\nBut we can\u2019t really pinpoint the moment when she arrived\u2014on our radar, at least. It feels as if we just looked up one day and there she was, stunning and perfectly deserving of the spotlight. All we know is that we\u2019ve had a hard time taking our eyes off of her ever since, because she consistently gets it right on the red carpet.\n\nThe 90th annual Academy Awards ceremony was no exception. The Glow Up Facebook live thread collectively gasped when Zendaya appeared on the step-and-repeat in a one-sleeved, deep-sienna-colored chiffon gown by Giambattista Valli. (Notably, the gown beautifully photographed chocolate brown against the red carpet, then appeared a burnished burgundy against the Oscars stage set, where she was a presenter.) On another star, the voluminous silhouette might have been overwhelming, but at a willowy 5 feet 10 inches, the 21-year-old looked like a true goddess, even as an ingenue among established megastars.\n\nBut everyone knows it takes a village to raise a successful red-carpet look, and Zendaya has found a dream team in stylist Law Roach (who also styled Mary J. Blige for the evening), makeup artist Sheika Daley and hairstylist Ursula Stephen, the mastermind who created many of Rihanna\u2019s most iconic looks.\n\nTo offset the volume of her dress, Stephen chose to keep her starlet\u2019s hair stylish and simple, telling The Glow Up, \u201cZendaya and I went back and forth about her look for tonight\u2019s show, but ultimately landed on a sleek and chic top knot to enhance the elegant silhouette created by her Giambattista Valli dress.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images)\n\nBut pulled-back doesn\u2019t automatically mean easy, especially when you\u2019re creating a style that has to last from the awards ceremony through the after-party. So Stephen\u2014a brand ambassador for Unilever as well as Dyson hair products\u2014gave The Glow Up her step-by-step on how to create the perfect topknot\u2014using her go-to tools and products. With most of these products available in our local drugstore, frankly, this is a high-low tutorial we can wrap our heads around. Says Stephen:\n\n\n\n\u201cI prepped Zendaya\u2019s damp hair by spritzing Dove Style + Care Smooth & Shine Heat Protection Spray [$5.99] throughout before blow-drying as straight as possible with my Dyson Supersonic hair dryer [$399.99], which was on high heat and speed.\n\n\u201cOnce the hair was dry\u2014and super shiny!\u2014I sprayed with Suave Professionals Natural Hold Compressed Micro Mist Hairspray [$3.94] and separated her hair in half from ear to ear and brushed the top section into a high ponytail, securing it with an elastic.\n\n\u201cNext, I brought the bottom section up and secured the two pieces together before twisting them up into a chic little knot, which I secured with hair pins. [Pro tip: Separating the hair into sections allows for more control over the look and ensures security through the night.]\n\n\u201cI finished the look with TRESemm\u00e9 Compressed Micro-Mist Hair Spray Hold Level 2: Smooth [$4.99] to keep strands sleek and in place all night, without the stiffness and crunch of a traditional hair spray.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Christopher Polk (Getty Images)\n\nOf course, pulling the star\u2019s hair off her face perfectly showcased a glowing face and gorgeous sienna smoky eye by makeup artist Sheika Daley. [Editor\u2019s note: The Glow Up reached out to Daley for the specific tricks and tools she used Oscar night, but as of press time, we haven\u2019t received the details.] To re-create the look, we\u2019d suggest using eye shadow colors from the Masquerade palette by Juvia\u2019s Place ($25 for a mini palette), or the Obsessions palette in Warm Brown from Huda Beauty ($27). To quickly create a sultry, smoky eye similar to Zendaya\u2019s:\n\nApply an eye shadow base or primer, to lock in color. We like Black Up\u2019s new Matte Eye Primer ($23). Apply liquid liner to the upper lash line, avoiding an obvious cat eye. Define the outer corners of each crease with a dark matte brown eye shadow shade. Using a deep mahogany shade, smoke the eye from lash to just above the crease, extending slightly at the outer ends.\n\nUse a fine brush to lightly smudge the same color on the lower lash line. Pop the inner corners of the eyes with a shimmering champagne shadow. Apply several layers of mascara\u2014making sure to avoid clumps!\n\nNeedless to say, we loved this look, not only for its drama but also for its timeless simplicity. The 90th annual Academy Awards were so filled with nostalgia that Rita Moreno even wore the dress she wore when she accepted her 1962 Oscar (and still fit in beautifully!) for West Side Story. But looking at Zendaya\u2019s gorgeous goddess-inspired glamour last night, it\u2019s hard to think that her polished, graceful beauty will ever go out of style.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images)\n\nEditor\u2019s note: A previous version of this post erroneously referred to the character of M.J. as the romantic interest in Spider-Man: Homecoming.", "keywords": ["oscars", "glamour", "look", "zendaya", "know", "getty", "served", "hair", "night", "shadow", "palette", "glow", "simply", "stunning", "eye"], "polarity": 0.21726044554696233, "subjectivity": 0.5395757737892568},

Following several seasons in which we\u2019ve seen an uptick in black models wearing their natural tresses on the runways, this season\u2019s presentations boasted a remarkable number of naturally coiffed models on the catwalks. Even labels that typically cater to more conservative consumers, such as Tory Burch and Bottega Veneta, featured not only black models but black models sporting their natural textures in a variety of lengths, shapes and styles.\n\nAnd while it may be tempting to call it a trend, considering the fact that the past year has seen women in the armed forces wholeheartedly embracing the natural-hair movement, more natural-hair moments than ever on the red carpet, and 2018\u2019s biggest film starring a primarily black and entirely naturally styled cast, it\u2019s safe to say that #TeamNatural has gained more than a toehold in popular culture.\n\nAs model Kristina Elise told fashion site PopSugar: \u201cFor me, leaving my hair natural for the runway is really important. It means that the designer is embracing me how I am and not trying to make me like everyone else\u2014because my hair is not like everyone else\u2019s and it\u2019s not going to look the same. I really appreciate it when they make that decision.\u201d\n\nAnd while we know black is always in fashion, it\u2019s nice to see the fashion world actually taking notice.

Janelle Mon\u00e1e, Taraji P. Henson and Octavia Spencer, the movie's three stars, were among the notable women on the panel, as well as the author of the book on which the movie is based, Margot Lee Shetterly.\n\nHidden Figures tells the incredible story of three brilliant African-American women\u2014Katherine Johnson (Henson), Dorothy Vaughn (Spencer) and Mary Jackson (Mon\u00e1e)\u2014who worked at NASA and were the brains behind the launch of astronaut John Glenn into orbit. The trio made history not only as women but as African-American women.\n\nDuring the panel discussion, the audience heard a bit about the lives and stories behind each character, especially concerning Katherine Johnson, who is celebrated in the film as the main source of intelligence behind one of the greatest operations in NASA history.\n\nHenson described Johnson as a courageous woman living in a time in history when accomplishments like hers were unheard of.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"You're talking about being the first woman in a room of all white men at a time where that was not popular. The courage to even walk in that room with your head held high,\" she said. \"I don't think many people could do that. Just the fear of 'What are they going to think of me?' or 'Will I make it?' The courage just to walk in that room speaks to her fearlessness, speaks to her tenacity, speaks to her brilliance.\n\n\"At the end of the day, you couldn't take her mind from her. You could call her all kinds of names and belittle her efforts, but she had a brilliant mind that God gave her. And she walked in that. She did not complain,\" Henson added.\n\nThe idea of Johnson not complaining was something that Henson emphasized and acknowledged that she learned and took away from in playing the role.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I use that in my life,\" she said. \"I don't complain about Hollywood. I don't say that they don't do this for black women and that and the third; I just keep working because one day you look up and you're a Golden Globe winner, you're Academy Award-nominated, but I couldn't get there by complaining.\"\n\nDorothy Vaughan, played by Spencer, was Johnson's supervisor, and Mary Jackson, played by Mon\u00e1e, was an engineer who also worked at the agency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen speaking of these three historic and inspiring women, Michelle Obama underlined the great dedication each had to their field, as well as their ability to maintain their poise during the racism and sexism that they faced at the time.\n\n\"Now, these women couldn't even drink from the same water fountain or use the same bathroom as many of their colleagues,\" the first lady pointed out. \"And folks didn't always take these women seriously because they were black and also because they were women. \u2026 But they didn't listen to those doubters, you understand? They did not listen to the haters.\"\n\nThe event was held in front of a small audience, much of it high school and middle school students. And so, fittingly, one of the main themes that seemed to be seen throughout the presentation was the importance of hard work and how far it can get individuals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"What also matters is how hard you're willing to work,\" Michelle Obama said. \"Because none of this is easy, and it's not supposed to be.\"\n\nWhen discussing hard work, the first lady referenced her own husband, President Barack Obama, and his diligent work ethic and serious commitment to his job.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Look at this eight years,\" she said. \"We were supposed to be 'hidden.' People didn't even want to believe we were real. But here we are, eight years later.\"\n\nObama further solidified her point, quoting Katherine Johnson toward the end of her remarks, saying, \"Stick with it; no matter the problem it can be solved.\"\n\nVeronica Graves is a digital-news associate at The Root.

Blige was the first person in Oscars history to be nominated for both an acting award and for best original song for the same film (and performed!). Jordan Peele became the first black person to score a win for best original screenplay. And in a surprise plot twist, Kobe Bryant is now also the first NBA player to score an Oscar win.\n\nAnd while we still have a long way to go in terms of representation (and after the success of Black Panther, we are anxious to see what next year\u2019s Oscars might bring), this year\u2019s ceremony was nevertheless filled with refreshing moments.\n\nOur favorite? Seeing Janet Mock, Patrisse Kahn-Cullors and Tarana Burke in the spotlight among an array of activists featured in Common and Andra Day\u2019s performance of their nominated song, \u201cStand Up for Something,\u201d from Marshall.\n\nBut this is The Glow Up, so aside from waiting to see if our faves would win, we fixed our collective gaze on the red carpet.

We learned that Lucious isn\u2019t the devil\u2019s spawn. His father was Joe, a cop, whom Lucious saw gunned down when he was a child. Empire has played fast and loose with flashbacks, so don\u2019t be shocked if Joe rises from the grave just like Lucious\u2019 mom, Leah. We learned that Lucious has a half-brother, Tariq, the federal agent who has been sniffing around. Lucious and Boo Boo Kitty got married so the feds couldn\u2019t force her to testify about Lucious. And the biggest cliffhanger: Rhonda figured out that her miscarriage was caused by Boo Boo Kitty; the women had an epic catfight and one of the them fell to her death.\n\nFare thee well, Rhonda.\n\nEmpire has been taking on racial issues since last season\u2019s #BlackLivesMatter rally. The message got lost because Cookie delivered her rousing speech in a gorilla outfit, but the show is still trying. Empire committed to realism for the aftermath of Rhonda\u2019s death: The cops swarmed the scene, Nancy Grace howled about another #BlondeGirlsMatter moment on TV and America held candlelight vigils.\n\nWait, what? The story didn\u2019t dominate the news? Ludicrous. Boo Boo Kitty isn\u2019t even being blamed for Rhonda\u2019s death. A woman falls to a death and people just move on to the next thing like nothing happened. In fairness, Cookie showed up at the hospital to deliver \u201cRhonda\u2019s things.\u201d What things? The woman just fell to her death. Unless she\u2019s talking about the late Rhonda\u2019s blood-soaked clothes, what the hell is in that box? Well, Cookie has her mind on other things. She\u2019s salty about Lucious and Boo Boo\u2019s wedding and spends her spare time cutting his face from photos.\n\nShyne, who had dirty dealings with Lucious and can tell the authorities about one of the Lyons\u2019 past sins, makes a deal to keep quiet if Lucious helps Shyne\u2019s protege, Nessa, who is a singer. She is booked to perform at Leviticus with Jamal.\n\nJamal, who is as disgusted with the world as the rest of us, raps a song referencing Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Alton Sterling and Philando Castile. Good luck with all that, Jamal. And try not to get shot on the way to the car. The rap turns into a \u201cFree Freda\u201d anthem. Freda\u2019s my girl and all, but she tried to gun down Lucious at a red-carpet event but missed and hit Jamal. Everyone saw it, so maybe Freda isn\u2019t the best choice for a hashtag. On the night of the show, however, Jamal flashes back to Freda shooting him and has a panic attack. Nessa performs beautifully, of course, and steals the show.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTime for the weekly awkward family dinner! Lucious invites Tariq to prove that his marriage to Boo Boo Kitty isn\u2019t a sham and that they\u2019re all one big happy family. I believe the fact that he eats asparagus with his fingers is meant to suggest that he was raised by wolves. Not to get all Miss Manners, but etiquette books allow that, so don\u2019t get all judgy. Poor Andre. As usual, nobody is paying him any attention, even though his wife just died (and what happened to her funeral?!). Jamal reminds us again that Lucious once put him in a trash can. This is turning into a drinking game\u2014swig!\n\nAndre ends up sobbing alone and referring to himself in the third person. Ghost Rhonda shows up to say she loves him and that they will be together in heaven, or something like that. Kidding! Andre has an apparition of Rhonda browbeating him and taunting him about his bipolar disorder. It\u2019s time for Ghost Rhonda to have a seat in the white light.\n\nAs a season premiere, the episode felt a bit flat and didn\u2019t give plot points enough attention. Yes, it is par for the course, but Andre\u2019s tragedy barely got any attention. Since Empire keeps trying to make a point about race issues, cops should have handcuffed Boo Boo Kitty to the bed while she was in labor. Nessa can sing, but we covered that ground last season with Freda, another talented artist related to one of Lucious\u2019 many enemies, and she\u2019ll probably end up competing with one of the Lyons, like the Hakeem-Freda war.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLucious\u2019 presumed-dead mother is back, but her mental illness is relegated to a scene or two of her acting weird, which is a waste of Leslie Uggams\u2019 legendary talents. She\u2019s given as much attention as the crazy aunt at Thanksgiving. Boo Boo Kitty is a Lyon, which was her dream. Why is she just sitting around and not throwing her new position in Cookie\u2019s face\u2014or plotting to knock Lucious off his high horse?

In the past four years, the third-generation hairstylist has been making her mark on Marvel films, leading the hair departments of the last two Captain America films, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 and, now, Black Panther.\n\nOf course, the Black Panther is a unique superhero, and Black Panther is already proving to be an exceptionally unique film, as Friend tells The Glow Up:\n\nI think Black Panther is\u2014I call it a stand-alone Marvel movie, even though Marvel still has a formula. But I feel like it\u2019s a stand-alone movie, especially for me, because I\u2019m a black woman, and [to do] the first black superhero, that was really an honor, in the sense [that] we\u2019re presenting all of this to the world. We had an important job to do, and I looked at it in a whole different way, because it represents my people. So I felt like, the weight of the world on me at some points, but in the greatest way\u2014that I had the opportunity to present us in the best possible light and put something on camera that\u2019s never been [seen]. So it\u2019s a great responsibility and it\u2019s a great challenge, but it\u2019s my greatest joy in doing it, also.\n\nRepresenting her people was paramount in Friend\u2019s mind as she approached the task of helping to bring Black Panther to life. To begin, she divided the film into three elements: traditional Africa, contemporary Africa and the futuristic Africa represented by the technologically advanced civilization that is Wakanda. In her research, she drew inspiration from everything from traditional African tribes like the Maasai and Zulu to the groundbreaking fashion statements we\u2019ve seen at Afropunk celebrations around the globe.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really taking and looking at traditional styles, traditional tribal looks, and seeing what we can make into a modern style,\u201d Friend says. \u201cI like to take, like, a period hairstyle and put it in a modern movie and just put a twist on it. For me, it\u2019s still about classic hairdressing and beautiful lines and silhouettes. That\u2019s how I design hair.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFriend has certainly had her share of experience with period styles, having also headed the hair departments of Miles Ahead, The Help, Django Unchained, Rock of Ages and Dreamgirls.

For Friend, natural hair textures were a major part of her contribution to the visual narrative.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a beautiful time where people are wearing their natural hair,\u201d she says. \u201cI mean, there [are] women everywhere who are like, \u2018Throw the pressing comb away, throw the relaxer away. I\u2019m going to wear my natural hair.\u2019 So that whole movement of the empowerment of the hair is there,\u201d Friend explains.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCreating a diverse universe of naturally styled characters involved a team highly skilled in styling, caring for and mimicking natural hairstyles, as in the case of Angela Bassett\u2019s glorious custom-made wig of 24-inch silvery locs, inspired in equal parts by writer Toni Morrison and director Ryan Coogler\u2019s mother, Joselyn.\n\nBut while Friend isn\u2019t playing favorites on the styles she created, she\u2019s already seeing the influence this film is having on our beauty and fashion choices. She\u2019s received countless raves on the twisted crop Lupita Nyong\u2019o rocks as Dora Milaje operative Nakia and graciously provided The Glow Up with the how-to (hint: The key is keeping it close to the scalp):\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the \u2018Wakanda knot\u2019\u2014because it is different than a Bantu knot,\u201d she tells us. \u201c[Because] basically, the hair is rolled down, kind of like a cinnamon roll. And then, once the hair is dried, then, we lifted it from there.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEducating other hairstylists is a huge part of Friend\u2019s career, as her greatest hope is to see more hairstylists performing at the top of their game. That\u2019s why she created Hair Scholars, a consortium of award-winning artists led by Friend in educating and preparing aspiring stylists to be the best at their craft and ready to work in the industry.\n\nFriend knows firsthand the value of having a talented team by her side. She credits her Black Panther team for being a large part of the inspiration and craftsmanship that we\u2019ll see on-screen next week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt just felt like our brains\u2014the brainpower was just so high, and the energy was so high, just because we got to create,\u201d she says. \u201cOr somebody\u2019s like, \u2018Well, let\u2019s try this.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018Let\u2019s try it!\u2019\n\n\u201cSo it was really great to have that think tank, where we could just be in there and be creating, and just really coming up with things on the fly ... just really having the momentum just to create original pieces that are going to stand the test of time on film,\u201d she continues.\n\nAnd of course, we couldn\u2019t end our conversation without asking Friend how it felt to be on the purple carpet for Black Panther\u2019s epic premiere in Los Angeles last week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe premiere was like, you know, it was like 2018 Coming to America\u2014like, it was for real. People took it all the way,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I think what it is too, is as black people, we have like\u2014especially now\u2014there\u2019s a sense of pride. People are wearing their hair natural. People are [saying] \u2018black excellence.\u2019 People are rising to the occasion, and I think this movie comes at the time where black people, we want to step forward; we want to be recognized.\n\n\u201cThis movie hits all the right notes for having a black superhero,\u201d she explains. \u201cI mean, at the end of the day, we all want to be superheroes, in whatever we do. If we\u2019re a mom, if we\u2019re a secretary, if we\u2019re a hairdresser\u2014whatever we do, we all want to be a superhero.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up tip: If you\u2019re an Los Angeles-based hair artist, you can join Camille Friend for a Hair Scholars master class at the \u201cHair and Makeup by ... \u201d Symposium on March 11 from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.", "keywords": ["panthers", "natural", "really", "movie", "think", "hair", "friend", "designer", "meet", "having", "traditional", "panther", "teamsupernatural", "black", "hero", "camille"], "polarity": 0.17398076259489295, "subjectivity": 0.5284920634920632},

Specifically, while the fictional world of Wakanda gave us a glimpse at what black civilization might have been like without European colonization, it also represented a world in which the systemic rape that accompanied slavery and colonization\u2014let alone voluntary miscegenation\u2014simply wasn\u2019t a consideration.\n\n\n\nSo it\u2019s a little surprising to learn that at one point, 19-year-old biracial actress Amandla Stenberg was seriously considered for one of the coveted leading roles in the film. While an undeniably talented actress who is no stranger to the genre (Hunger Games, anyone?), Stenberg would never be mistaken for a purely African woman.\n\nBut what\u2019s less surprising is that Stenberg\u2014also a staunch and outspoken young activist who faced racist accusations of miscasting after portraying what many mistakenly presumed to be the blond and blue-eyed character Rue in the first film adaptation of the Hunger Games trilogy\u2014was aware of this as well. At the recent TIFF Next Wave Festival, she recounted the experience in an interview with the Canadian Broadcast Co.:\n\nOne of the most challenging things for me to do was to walk away from Black Panther. I got really, really close and they were like, \u201cDo you want to continue fighting for this?\u2019 And I was like, \u201cThis isn\u2019t right.\u201d These are all dark-skin actors playing Africans and I feel like it would have just been off to see me as a biracial American with a Nigerian accent just pretending that I\u2019m the same color as everyone else in the movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile her admission challenges some of our previous assumptions about how the movie was cast, it\u2019s a moment of self-awareness we rarely see in Hollywood, particularly in the narrow realm of quality roles for black actresses. And while it was no doubt devastating not to participate in one of the most powerful and anticipated black films in history, Stenberg stands by her choice:\n\nThat was really challenging, to make that decision, but I have no regrets. I recognize 100 percent that there are spaces that I should not take up, and when I do take up a space, it\u2019s because I\u2019ve thought really, really critically about it and I\u2019ve consulted people I really trust and it feels right.\n\nFrom her mouth to Zoe Saldana\u2019s ears. It is so refreshing to see an actress less concerned with advancing her own career than with making sure that representation is on point, and we (and, we suspect, Letitia Wright, who brilliantly played Shuri) thank her for her humility and integrity. Colorism is enough of a plague in Hollywood without lighter-skinned actresses co-opting roles that don\u2019t resemble them in the least.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut we deeply appreciate Stenberg\u2019s stance, especially when she is also fully aware of the lack of solid roles available to her. In the interview, she speaks about being forced to take time to choose wisely after her breakthrough role at age 12. But she trusted then\u2014as she clearly does now\u2014that her discernment and patience would lead her exactly where she needs to be:\n\nI still am really young and it\u2019s not a race. I didn\u2019t feel like I had to be working all the time just to prove that I could work. I still have a lot of time. You don\u2019t have to force your career to happen all at once.\n\nYou can read the entire article here, but we\u2019re just going to stand and give a Wakandan salute to Amandla Stenberg for doing the work of self-awareness and true sisterhood. This is how you walk the talk.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(Editor\u2019s note: Since publication of this article, we\u2019ve received further clarification from one one of our intrepid sci-fi loving readers that kind of like Jesus, the character of Rue was described as having \u201cdark brown skin and eyes\u201d and \u201chair like moss\u201d in The Hunger Games novel. So, those in opposition to Stenberg playing the role weren\u2019t even protesting color-blind casting. They were just plain racist.

Henson and Janelle Mon\u00e1e\u2014had been sold. This comes as no surprise: The story of these brilliant African-American female \u201chuman computers\u201d who were instrumental in calculating the math necessary to propel rockets into space is fascinating. The only surprise is that this story has not been told before.\n\nNovelist Toni Morrison says, \u201cIf there\u2019s a book that you want to read but it hasn\u2019t been written yet, then you must write it.\u201d Enter Shetterly, who grew up in Hampton, Va., the site where this mathematical research was done\u2014and who also knew first-hand many of the black women who had been employed to do these mathematical calculations.\n\n\u201cThe idea that black women had been recruited to work as mathematicians at the NASA installation in the South during the days of segregation defies our expectations and challenges much of what we think we know about American history,\u201d writes Shetterly.\n\nSimply put, this book is the story she needed to write.\n\n\u201cAs a child, I knew so many African Americans working in science, math and engineering that I thought that\u2019s just what black folks did,\u201d writes Shetterly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis was her normal. There was Mrs. Land, a NASA mathematician who taught Sunday school every Sunday morning. There was Katherine Johnson, who worked on computing the trajectory for John Glenn\u2019s space flight. There was Dorothy Vaughan, who wrote the textbook on algebraic methods for the mechanical calculating machines used throughout the department.\n\nAnd these women are just the beginning.\n\n\u201cI can put names to almost 50 black women who worked as computers, mathematicians, engineers or scientists at the Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory from 1943 through 1980, and my intuition is that 20 more names can be shaken loose from the archives with more research,\u201d writes Shetterly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Shetterly is careful to note that what seemed normal to her did not come easily to this previous generation. Her father, growing up during segregation, had a passion for engineering but was told to become a physical education teacher instead.\n\n\u201cIn those days,\u201d writes Shetterly, \u201ccollege-educated African Americans with book smarts and common sense put their chips on teaching jobs or sought work at the post office.\u201d\n\nShetterly\u2019s father\u2019s love of engineering\u2014\u201che built his first rocket in junior high metal shop class\u201d\u2014would not let him give up his dream. Still, it was not easy: \u201cAs late as 1970, just 1 percent of all American engineers were black\u2014a number that doubled to a whopping 2 percent by 1984,\u201d writes Shetterly. \u201cStill, the federal government was the most reliable employer of African Americans in the sciences and technology: In 1984, 8.4 percent of NASA\u2019s engineers were black.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHidden Figures shines a much-needed light on the contributions of black women in science and technology that have been vastly overlooked. In prose that is engaging and compelling, Shetterly refutes the commonly held stereotype that STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) fields are the province of men, specifically white men. Black women have been doing this work for ages. Before desktop computers, black women were the computing machines, using their vast intelligence to determine the orbital trajectories of space flight and accomplish other leading discoveries in aerodynamics and engineering.\n\n\u201cEven as a professional in an integrated world, I have been the only black woman in enough drawing rooms and boardrooms to have an inkling of the chutzpah it took for an African-American woman in a segregated southern workplace to tell her bosses she was sure her calculations would put a man on the Moon,\u201d Shetterly writes.\n\nIt is this empathy with her subjects\u2014her ability to put herself in their shoes\u2014that brings the narrative to life. Steeped in history and thorough research, Shetterly also crafts richly drawn portrayals of these black women who were mathematicians, engineers and scientists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn vivid, specific detail, Shetterly paints the personal and professional lives of these black women who were vital to America\u2019s scientific advancement. We see their brilliance in their work; we see the ever-present institutional racism; we see the racist microaggressions from white colleagues; we see the inevitable \u201cColored Only\u201d signs on drinking fountains and bathrooms in their workplace Langley. And yet these women were responsible for some of the greatest scientific advancements of the age.\n\nThis is a book that should be required reading in schools\u2014both as a history of science and technology and an inspiration for young black women to succeed in STEM fields. This is history that needs to be told; this is history that is still an ever-present reality for women of color working in STEM fields.\n\nBy celebrating these black female \u201chuman computers,\u201d we give credit to the work of black women that has, like the achievements of black women in so many other fields, historically been ignored. In Shetterly\u2019s clear, vibrant prose, we have a compelling, thoroughly researched narrative that is in a class of its own. A groundbreaking, deeply inspiring read.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHope Wabuke is a Southern California-based writer and a contributing editor at The Root.

The NAACP Image Award nominee\u2014perhaps best known for her portrayal of Angela in Tyler Perry\u2019s hit television show For Better or Worse\u2014has been working as an actress for two decades. She has appeared in films\u2014including Daddy\u2019s Little Girls and Why Did I Get Married?\u2014and critically acclaimed TV shows, like Boston Common, The Tom Show, Chicago Hope and The Steve Harvey Show.\n\nHer breakout role came on HBO\u2019s Emmy Award-winning series The Corner, as Veronica \u201cRonnie\u201d Boice, a drug-addicted woman trying to survive on the tough streets of West Baltimore. Smith\u2019s stellar portrayal of that character opened the door to Hollywood, and she hasn\u2019t looked back.\n\nMost recently, Smith has earned roles on two of television\u2019s most popular shows, Empire and Power. On Empire, Smith plays Carol, the naive, impressionable, substance-abusing baby sister of Cookie (Taraji P. Henson) and Candace (Vivica A. Fox). Carol is quite a departure from the roles that have led to a perception that Smith has been typecast, and she\u2019s \u201cloving the ability to be creative\u201d and show what she can do on the small screen.\n\nThe Root caught up with Smith upon her return from Botswana and South Africa (Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban), where she was conducting free acting workshops for Tasha Smith Actors Workshop, to talk about surviving in Hollywood and life.\n\nThe Root: What has it been like working on Empire?\n\nTasha Smith: Honestly, I have more people coming up to me talking about Cookie\u2019s sister, Carol, than I have had people coming up to me talking about Angela and Marcus [Why Did I Get Married? and For Better or Worse]. It\u2019s crazy how people are addicted to Empire. It\u2019s like an entertainment drug. People are \u201cteam Empire\u201d all of the way, and for me creatively, it has been such a blessing because I feel like I\u2019ve been kind of stuck creatively. I\u2019ve played the Angela character for so long that having the opportunity to be able to play Carol and to play a different tone creatively feels good.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor me to also be able to work with Taraji, Terrence [Howard], Jussie [Smollett], Gabby [Gabourey Sidibe], Trai [Byers], [Empire co-creator] Lee Daniels, and the writers and different directors of the show, it has been a creative dream. It has been like going to my favorite restaurant and eating all of my favorite foods. I am so fulfilled working on that show creatively, and I\u2019m having the best time ever!\n\nTR: What makes playing the character of Carol a \u201ccreative dream\u201d and a \u201cblessing?\u201d\n\nTS: I love the fact that I don\u2019t know what the hell they\u2019re doing with Carol. I don\u2019t know from one moment to the next where the writers are going; so each time I play her, it\u2019s a surprise. I have to trust that I don\u2019t know where the character is going, because I can\u2019t go on where the character is going to end, because I don\u2019t know. It is trusting the writers and directors within the actual moment [of filming] with the information you have.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI love how unstable Carol is. You don\u2019t know what she\u2019s going to do. Is she on drugs? Is she not on drugs? Is she going to relapse or is she not going to relapse? Is she going to run her mouth too much? Is she not going to run her mouth too much? She\u2019s the most unstable character ever, and I don\u2019t know what the hell is going on with her, and I love it!\n\nI love the relationship between her and Cookie. It\u2019s that sister relationship that we all go through. You want to be able to prove yourself to your family, and you want to do better even though you\u2019ve made a lot of mistakes. Cookie wants to love Carol and support Carol, but she can\u2019t take the crap that Carol keeps going through. Cookie gives Carol that tough love.\n\nTR: Speaking of tough love, you went through a horrible breakup last year. What has life been like following that major life event?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTS: After I went through the situation I went through a year ago\u2014finding out the person I married was a complete con artist\u2014after going through the trial and being granted the annulment, it was a big shock to my system. So my whole goal at this point in my life is to really have fun, to enjoy myself. Enjoy who I am, travel.\n\nUp until this point, I was so focused on feeling like I had to start a family and be in a relationship, which made me very vulnerable to that relationship. I\u2019ve learned I don\u2019t have to have one relationship to validate me as a woman. I don\u2019t have children. I may never have children. If I choose to have children, they may be adopted. Who knows?\n\nAt this point as a 45-year-old woman that loves herself, I am enjoying life. I am traveling because I always wanted to see the world. I\u2019m enjoying my sisterhood friendships around me with friends like Tisha Campbell-Martin and just have a freaking blast. The traveling is contributing to me personally, spiritually and creatively.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: You have been traveling and recently returned from a trip to Africa. Tell me about the Tasha Smith Actors Workshop and what you did there.\n\nTS: TSAW, which I started about 10 years ago, is something I\u2019m in love with. As far as community service, it\u2019s the best thing I\u2019ve ever done. It\u2019s like my church\u2014the church of acting. I\u2019m passionate about doing TSAW tours. I go to different cities and I teach acting workshops and seminars.\n\nThe reason for my trip to Botswana, Cape Town and Jo\u2019burg was to teach an acting seminar there. I had over 100 students who came out from Cape Town, Jo\u2019burg, Durban, and they spent a whole day with me. I taught eight hours straight and I did it for free because I wanted to give back to the acting community in Africa. It was a blessing and a beautiful thing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNsenga K.

In fact, I\u2019m dying over the slogan nails from designer Christian Siriano that hit drugstore shelves just in time for New York Fashion Week (pictured above).\n\nArtificial nails are one of the fastest-growing categories in beauty right now, climbing about 14 percent last year alone (pdf). Why are so many women skipping the relaxation of the nail salon and ditching the drying time\u2014not to mention the chemicals in nail products\u2014in favor of press-on packaged nails? Cost and convenience, of course!\n\nBut for women who are pregnant or nursing, it\u2019s also the perfect way to avoid unnecessary chemical exposure for your unborn child. At the recent Grammy Awards, Chrissy Teigen popped on a set of stiletto-shaped nails in Forbidden, painted with Gel Strong polish in Vampire for her red-carpet stroll.

The 21-year-old self-proclaimed \u201cIvorian goddess and polyvalent artist\u201d has taken matters into her own hands\u2014and hair\u2014creating an Instagram full of surrealist imagery that tackles our worst insecurities head-on (pun intended).\n\nUsing her own hair, thread, needle, fabric, wire, wool, hair extensions and a lot of imagination, Ky creates elaborate and evocative sculptures atop her head, literally weaving a narrative that disputes the negative stories we tell ourselves. From her home in Ivory Coast, she was gracious enough to speak with The Glow Up about her inspiration and process (Editor\u2019s note: As Ky\u2019s first language is French, there has been minor paraphrasing for clarity):\n\nI always loved everything about style in general, and hair included. I\u2019ve known how to braid since I was 4 or 5, but what really inspired me to sculpt my hair is an Instagram photo album that I saw a year ago. That album presented the hairstyles that women wore long ago in some African tribes. It made me fall in love with my African culture more than I already was before. These were really impressive and artistic, and it made me want to use the hairstyle as one of my means of expression.\n\n\u201cImpressive and artistic\u201d are certainly appropriate words to describe Ky\u2019s hair sculptures, many of which would be as at home in a Tim Burton film as in the African tribes that inspired her. Ladders, animals and whimsical shapes and silhouettes of all kinds literally sprout from Ky\u2019s brain, telling both her stories and those of many of her approximately 60,000 followers on Instagram. And while Ky is working on several concurrent artistic projects, using her hair as the medium in this series has been especially self-affirming:\n\nSince always, the hair of black women\u2014as well as their hairstyles\u2014were considered not pretty enough. And with the return of natural hair to the black community, hairstyle has become a beauty asset, a way of self-affirmation and a claim of its beauty. To use the hairstyle as [a] means of expression is therefore a powerful means, because it speaks to all black women who for a long time have [been made to] believe that their hair was not dope enough.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKy hopes to eventually exhibit and sell her series of vulnerability-inspired images\u2014but in the interim, she doesn\u2019t take the overwhelmingly positive response she\u2019s received lightly:", "keywords": ["hairstory", "means", "artistic", "kys", "hair", "ky", "beauty", "artist", "styling", "african", "making", "instagram", "insecurities", "away", "hairstyle", "black"], "polarity": 0.15338383838383834, "subjectivity": 0.5628619528619528},

It was a triumph as epic as the film itself. But Panther isn\u2019t the only black-helmed film being released by Disney this winter; we are now only two weeks away from the release of A Wrinkle in Time, directed by Ava DuVernay.\n\nFeaturing Oprah, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Mindy Kaling, Reese Witherspoon and Chris Pine and starring newcomer Storm Reid as young heroine Meg Murry, A Wrinkle in Time is certain to serve up its own brand of black-girl movie magic on March 9. And along with all of you avid filmgoers, we especially think our girls should be there to see it.\n\nEnter the \u201cA Wrinkle in Time Challenge\u201d (#AWITChallenge): an initiative to buy out eight theaters in cities around the country\u2014Austin, Texas; Charlotte, N.C.; Chicago; Greensboro, N.C.; Houston; Philadelphia; Plainfield, N.J.; and Washington, D.C.\u2014for black girls (and nonboys) to see the film on opening weekend.\n\nCoordinated by the online group Sisters in the Storm, \u201ca collective of black women focused on community engagement and Sisterhood among black women & non-men,\u201d a GoFundMe page has been created with the aim of raising $25,000, reaching nearly half their goal in the past 10 days, with just under a week left to go. But behind their valiant mission is a heartbreaking story, as co-founder Sherronda J. Brown explains in an essay at Medium:\n\nIn late January, a black girl named Stormiyah Denson-Jackson passed away in an apparent suicide at the public boarding school she attended. She was twelve years old and already madly in love with math and science\u2014a #RealMeg. But this love she had made her the target of bullying and verbal abuse from her classmates. Devastated by their taunts, she chose to end her life rather than live with the shame they tried to make her feel for being a \u201cnerd\u201d who enjoyed engaging with sciences and mathematics. There is a narrow image of blackness in the social imagination, mired with stereotypes and white ascendant ideals about black intellect, capability, and mobility. For black women and girls, beliefs, about our blackness\u2014how it is allowed to look, what it is allowed to achieve\u2014can never be divorced from beliefs about our gender. There is a social stigma about challenging these expectations and permissions, and it constantly impacts our experiences in the world, but never more significantly than when we are growing up, learning who we are, and deciding who we want to become.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike the momentum that grew around the #BlackPantherChallenge, raising over $620,000 from all 50 states to make it possible for black children to see themselves reflected on film, Sisters of the Storm\u2019s act of love and generosity is inspiring others to do the same for the #AWITChallenge. For instance, writer and Lemonade Syllabus creator Candice Benbow has set her own goal to make A Wrinkle in Time accessible to 200 girls in Hamilton, N.J. As she told The Glow Up, it\u2019s a gift she hopes to make in memory of her mother:\n\nI wanted to ensure that we do our part to support Ava and this film just like we supported Ryan Coogler and Black Panther. But also, my mom took me to the library every Friday, and would take me to the movies whenever something came out for kids. This movie and the moment around it reminds me of my childhood and time with my mother. I wanted to honor that by participating in this challenge so black girls today can look back on similar memories and smile. What Ava has done with this film made history, and black girls need to see that there is no dream too big for them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe have seen firsthand the impact that seeing black superheroes on film can have on our children\u2014and ourselves. With A Wrinkle in Time, we also have yet another opportunity\u2014and plenty of incentive\u2014to show Hollywood that blockbusters star black people, too.\n\nBut for real-life Meg Murrys, or Shuris, or other struggling Stormiyah Denson-Jacksons, A Wrinkle in Time may also provide exactly the affirmation and inspiration they need to flourish as their brilliant, STEM-loving, \u201cblack girl nerd\u201d selves. As Brown wrote: \u201cSeeing ourselves represented as heroes has undeniable power, and feeling our absence in these roles also influences the way that we see ourselves and our blackness.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s do it again, y\u2019all.\n\nThe Glow Up tip: A Wrinkle in Time opens in theaters on Friday, March 9. You can support Sisters in the Storm\u2019s $25,000 #AWITChallenge via its GoFundMe page until March 1. You can also spend $20 to sponsor a black girl to see the film in Hamilton, N.J., via Candice Benbow\u2019s website. Or begin your own challenge locally.

Henson when she played \u201cI know who stole my car, Jody!\u201d Yvette in Baby Boy. Her character was the perfect blend of attitude and vulnerability, while playing a woman who was doing the most to make her man \u2018do right.\u2019\n\nOver the years, Taraji played a ton of roles and began to become more and more known in the mainstream world. However, she never changed her style, her flow, or her persona. In interviews she was always funny, down-to-earth, and just real. Southeast D.C. stand up!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe finally got the role of a lifetime playing Cookie in Fox\u2019s Empire. You know Empire. It\u2019s the show everyone\u2019s watching and if you\u2019re not watching you\u2019re bragging about not watching. Taraji playing an animal print wearing, straight out a 90\u2019s Lil\u2019 Kim video, don\u2019t take no shit won\u2019t be no shit Cookie has you wondering if she\u2019s doing any acting at all. Like where does Taraji end and Cookie began? The lines seem blurred for sure.\n\nBut everything was made clear when Taraji presented Regina King with an Emmy award on Sunday. Taraji, in the spirit of sisterhood and all that is holy, stood on that stage and clapped furiously while letting out a single yasssss in front of a majority White audience. That\u2019s when I looked up from my TV and was like, \u201cOh Taraji is a real one.\u201d\n\nNot only is she a real one, but I\u2019ve decided that she is the ultimate homegirl. The epitome of ride or die. The definition of sisters are doing it for themselves. The one you want by your side when things are going left and totally sideways.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere are a few things I think Taraji would do for you if she were your homegirl:\n\n1. Do a popup/drive by with you to your man\u2019s house: You know she is just a phone call away and ready to roll up with you to your man\u2019s house unannounced because something ain\u2019t right. And she won\u2019t ask any questions.\n\n2. Be the Salt to your Pepa at a 90\u2019s Reminisce party: She\u2019ll be right there in her bamboo and gold chains (she might even have that asymmetrical haircut) reenacting the \u2018Push It\u2019 video.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. Make you take Henny shots to lament your break up: While yelling fuck that nigga the whole time. Cause you know she\u2019s drinking that brown.\n\n4. Cuss someone out on your behalf: Carryout messed up your order and they don\u2019t care? She\u2019s cussing them out for you. A customer service representative tells you that you can\u2019t get a refund? Hand her the phone right now so she can tell them what they not fina do.\n\n5. Help you bust his car windows or slash his tires with you: You know she has her own tools at the ready so she don\u2019t have to get ready.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. Fry your chicken hard when you\u2019re going through a hard time: And also make some mac and cheese and cornbread to help get you through.\n\n7. Literally cut a motherfucka for talking across the table during Spades: Don\u2019t try her. Ever.\n\n8. Publicly hate that person on your behalf: Maybe it\u2019s your coworker. Or your sister-in-law. Or your man\u2019s \u201cbest\u201d female friend. You don\u2019t like them, but you can\u2019t make it apparent that you don\u2019t like them. But Taraji can. And she will. She will take all your stories, channel them, and turn them into a delicious rage on your behalf.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. Help you cut up, burn, or bleach his clothes: Without hesitation or question. Notice, that Taraji asks no questions.\n\n10. Help you pack: When you do decide to leave that no good dude, Taraji is there helping you pack your stuff and taking some of his shit too. Cause you earned it, girl.\n\n11. Cheer for you or your child at graduation even though they said please hold your applause: What?! You don\u2019t tell Taraji to hold her applause. Is you serious?! Do you know what it took to get us here?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n12. Fight that ho: In the club. In the street. At a house party. In jeans. In stiletto pumps. In a bonnet. If she sees your man out with another chick, she\u2019s fighting her. If there\u2019s a ho who\u2019s trying y\u2019all, she\u2019s fighting her. She\u2019s taking off her earrings and she\u2019s not asking no questions.\n\n13. Fight that nigga: Especially if he hits you first. She\u2019s fighting him.\n\n14. Have y\u2019all be the only two on the dance floor: Imagine walking into a spot where music is playing, but nobody is dancing. Taraji is definitely doing a \u2018this is wack\u2019 face, then saying it out loud, and then pulling you on the dance floor to get the party started. And that\u2019s when the fun would begin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n15. Pull tissues out her bra during your wedding: As your maid of honor, she\u2019s got everything you need to get you through your big day.\n\n16. Make you a \u2018Help Get You Through Your Breakup\u2019 Mixtape: Replete with Mary J. Blige, Keyshia Cole, Erykah Badu, and K. Michelle.\n\n17. Make you a \u2018Ok Get Over That Nigga\u2019 Mixtape \u2013 Replete with Trina, Lil\u2019 Kim, Kanye West, and Beyonc\u00e9.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n18. Let you cry: Without judgment.\n\n19. Take you out for drinks: Because it\u2019s your birthday. Because you got a promotion. Or a raise. Or bought a house. She\u2019s taking you out for dranks, and she\u2019s telling the whole bar about your accomplishment so they can buy you shots. Of Henny.\n\n20. Tell you she loves you, she\u2019s got your back, she\u2019s proud of you: And you know she means it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDiana Veiga is a Spelman woman, a DC resident and a freelance writer.

But maybe it\u2019s not specific to that. Maybe it\u2019s just cutting your hair off ... I\u2019ve had the same hair my entire life. I was born with a very full \u2019fro, so, it\u2019s never\u2014even as a baby\u2014been as short as it is right now. So it\u2019s definitely a new world.

And so it\u2019s really great for me to see this\u2014I guess it\u2019s being called a \u201cmovement\u201d\u2014women just learning how to care for what comes out of their heads. And it\u2019s nice to have people feel like they have more options, you know? Because we can always do what we want to do, or what we feel comfortable doing\u2014whether it\u2019s a weave or it\u2019s a perm or anything else. But it\u2019s when we don\u2019t feel like we have an option that it becomes a problem; when it then becomes a societal issue, rather than a personal decision.

I think it has a lot to do with something that happens when people convert to a lot of things. It\u2019s always the recent converts\u2014whether it be religious dogma or philosophy or anything else\u2014that tend to be really extreme. I live in a little less of an extreme world, in my personal life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndeed, even her decision to crop her famous locks was initially met with more opposition than support. But after years of joking about taking the leap, DaCosta ultimately took the decision in stride: \u201cI was walking down the street, and as crazy as this may sound, I heard a voice\u2014maybe it was my own inner voice or higher self\u2014just say, \u2018Cut your hair.\u2019\u201d\n\nAfter considering it late into the night, she lit some candles, sat down in front of her computer and recorded a conversation with herself, contemplating all of the things she would be releasing by cutting her hair:\n\nAnd when I tell you, after childbirth, that was the most powerful experience of my life. I cried, I hugged and kissed myself; it was amazing. And I never looked back. I always thought when people do that, the next day they wake up, like, \u201cOh my God, what did I do? I ruined my life.\u201d I didn\u2019t. I felt good about it. ... There\u2019s so much that has happened since [then] that I know would not have been possible had I been weighed down by the weight that I was carrying; the toxic relationships, other people\u2019s expectations of me, safety, hiding, not feeling beautiful without it. ... One of the things that I cut off as well was fear, and in doing so, realized how guided I was, not by love or confidence, but fear.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConfidence is an issue DaCosta confesses to having struggled with in younger years. She recalls an experience early on in her professional acting career, when her father presented her with a unique challenge:\n\nHe goes, \u201cI just have one question: \u2018Where does your confidence come from?\u2019 Don\u2019t answer now\u2014just think about it\u201d ... I think that that was\u2014it was an invitation to step into the answer, to figure out what it was. And it\u2019s something that I guess is from life, when you\u2019re ready to come into yourself. And it can\u2019t be forced and it can\u2019t be faked. And you know, it\u2019s amazing having all these mirrors around me now, and people, and relationships, and just seeing how the types of people coming into my life now are different. And I\u2019m so inspired by them, and they\u2019re a reflection of the work that I\u2019ve been doing to answer that question.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd while DaCosta has every intention of growing her hair back\u2014healthier and with new energy and genuine confidence\u2014taking the risk has come back to reward her tenfold, especially as she becomes more aware of the impact her image has had on others:", "keywords": ["dacosta", "growth", "chop", "chicago", "meds", "natural", "know", "life", "hair", "big", "images", "premiere", "2016", "teamnatural", "yaya", "2015", "talks", "growing"], "polarity": 0.1759024490002751, "subjectivity": 0.5000853454114325},

Otherwise, I know you wouldn\u2019t want to spoil your upcoming trip by reading the incredible conversation The Glow Up had with the film\u2019s production designer, Hannah Beachler. (Consider yourself warned: There might be spoilers ahead. For instance, did you know that from the aerial view, the Royal Talon Fighter is modeled after a mask from the Dogon tribe?)\n\nLong before the movie premiered, we were in awe of how many incredible women were involved in Black Panther\u2014both on- and offscreen: from director of photography Rachel Morrison to costume designer Ruth E. Carter and lead hairstylist Camille Friend. But it is Beachler, the visionary hired by director Ryan Coogler to help him bring Wakanda to life, who is the architect of this new corner of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, as she told The Glow Up:\n\nYou know, we had to create all of this history\u2014just like you\u2019d know about any city, or your own hometown. That\u2019s how much we had to go in on Wakanda, because Ryan said to me one day: \u201cWhat are the names of the streets? What do they do in that building? What is it about this park that makes it unique? What\u2019s the history of that area? What different parts of town are there? Who lives there?\u201d ... So we just started from the beginning. We started with a timeline and made a timeline of, like, 10,000 years ago. We started 10,000 years ago, and we worked our way up to 2018. ... I always say the production designer is the believer. I have to believe in this world; I had to believe that I was a Wakandan architect to create Wakanda, and I had to be there 24-7 for a year. That was my mindset. So it was all about that, always. And for each film, you do that in the different world you\u2019re telling the story of.\n\nTo not only believe in Wakanda but also treat it as its own character was vital to making a fictional country real for both the characters and viewers to inhabit. In doing so, Beachler drew from Coogler\u2019s relationship with his own hometown of Richmond, Calif.\u2014right outside of Oakland, where the Black Panther film begins:\n\nThe first thing I knew that we would do was figure out the place, because it\u2019s such an important thing to Ryan. You know his relationship with his hometown of Oakland is a very strong one, and when we did Fruitvale, I started to understand, like, what that relationship\u2014how that forms who he is, and formed the way he tells a story and what he tells a story about.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, this isn\u2019t Beachler\u2019s first adventure with Coogler. He initially recruited her to work with him on his first feature film, the critically acclaimed Fruitvale Station (also his first of three films starring actor Michael B. Jordan), followed by 2015\u2019s Creed. It\u2019s almost inconceivable that the epic that is Black Panther is only Coogler\u2019s third major film, but Beachler has been on his team every step of the way:\n\nI just kind of followed Ryan along. And I just allowed him to take me on this adventure of things I never imagined I\u2019d be doing in my life, and just trusting him wholeheartedly and understanding that he is an important voice. ... Just everything I\u2019ve learned from Ryan throughout our filmmaking friendship in the last six years, everything culminated to Black Panther.\n\nBeachler told us that if people actually knew the amount of work that went into designing Black Panther, \u201ctheir heads would explode\u2014literally just explode.\u201d But as the second person hired behind Coogler himself, Beachler said that the first step was going to Africa to do research. While Coogler made two sojourns to different countries on the continent, Beachler was sent to Cape Town, South Africa, arriving two weeks ahead of the crew to do research before they all traveled throughout the country, as she told The Glow Up:\n\n\n\nWe spent as much time in each place as we possibly could, and saw as much as we possibly could, because it was important for me to get the vegetation right, the rock color right\u2014the way that the rocks are sort of different. They\u2019re horizontal, as opposed to what we\u2019re used to seeing in the West. To make sure that the color of the sand was right, to make sure the color of the water inland was right, as opposed to what it looked like on the coast of Africa. You know, all those little details were so very important to get right for us to create this world in a way that interpreted the beauty that I saw when I was there. Because even your eyes can\u2019t do you right when you\u2019re in the Motherland, because it is so beautiful, and it\u2019s so big. You become a little swayed with the size of everything, and the fact that you lose a sense of proportion. ... It\u2019s godly in the sense that you feel how small you are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney Marvel Studios/Disney 1 / 8\n\nBut those weeks in Africa taught Beachler something else: the still-existing connection between Africa and its displaced children in America, even after so many miles and centuries apart:\n\nWhat [Ryan] has said since is: \u201cWe\u2019ve been African all along. We\u2019re just doing what we\u2019ve been doing for thousands of years, but we\u2019ve been told that it\u2019s ghetto, or it\u2019s hood, or it\u2019s wrong, or it\u2019s shameful, or it\u2019s bad. But we\u2019re just being who we are. All the horrible things that happened to us in this country, and they can\u2019t wipe that out\u2014they can\u2019t wipe out who we are. That\u2019s the connection.\u201d And that\u2019s what I saw when I went to Africa. ... I\u2019ve always been this way. I didn\u2019t know why. I didn\u2019t how in my DNA I\u2019m doing these things that, no matter what environment I\u2019m in, I\u2019ve always been that person because it is part of me. You know, my ancestry doesn\u2019t begin in a cotton field.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRepresenting as much of the African Diaspora as possible within one fictional country was a specific challenge. It was equally important to Beachler to depict the African people with a distinct sense of pride and joy. To do so involved breaking through some of her own biases, which she told us was imperative in creating Wakanda:\n\nThere\u2019s no part of Africa that looks like the other. It\u2019s not homogeneous, where you can just pick one certain tribe and link it to another for no apparent reason. It\u2019s all different, and they\u2019re different countries. So that was, I think, where the eclectic nature of everything came in, because it\u2019s hard. You know, you can\u2019t represent everything, but I can certainly interpret the fact that there are so many different things within Wakanda and within that one culture. And the other thing was ... I had a lot of work to do to get past my black American idea of what Africa was. I\u2019m not gonna lie. I remember when we started out, I was very nervous about how things would be perceived because it was this shell that I was in and how I was perceiving it. You\u2019re made to feel ashamed about some of the things that you see in Africa ... you know, huts and mud floors. We\u2019re told they\u2019re not \u201ccivilized\u201d\u2014black Americans are a bastardized piece of the culture. And it\u2019s not true at all. You\u2019re there and you see the joy, and you see the pride that people have in their tribes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeachler is the first-ever female production designer of a Marvel film\u2014let alone a black female production designer. She told us that she has mixed feelings about being a pioneer in her traditionally male-dominated field:\n\n\n\nThat is both heartbreaking and exhilarating, all at the same time. Like, I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s celebratory, in the sense that I\u2019m glad to be out there\u2014you know, if you don\u2019t see it, you can\u2019t be it. And I\u2019m hoping those young women and young men of color are looking and saying, \u201cI can do this.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlong with her work on Black Panther and Coogler\u2019s other two films, Beachler\u2019s production-design credits include the Oscar-nominated Miles Ahead, the groundbreaking visual album Lemonade and last year\u2019s Academy Award winner for Best Picture, Moonlight.\n\nAnd while the title of production designer may seem vague, it\u2019s only because it involves overseeing so many components that are instrumental in creating the visual narrative of a film, combining elements of architecture, interior design, graphic design and more. Equally important for Beachler, it is an opportunity to control and change the narrative around black lives and representation:\n\nYou know, for me, it\u2019s always been so very important to have representation behind the camera, because I understand that there are certain decisions that are being made behind the cameras that affect what you see in the end, and how you understand it to be. And at one point, I realized\u2014probably on Fruitvale\u2014that having a black voice behind the camera is as powerful as having one in front of it. ... And I felt like I was becoming this\u2014in a sense, not a \u201cgatekeeper,\u201d for lack of a better word, of the process; of making sure that the process didn\u2019t misrepresent [us] because there was not that representation behind the camera. ... So I\u2019m very protective of that\u2014of what it is\u2014what it really is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Hannah Beachler, imagining the world of Wakanda involved testing the limits of our own historical knowledge and cultural consciousness: What would our culture be if we had our own agency over it? Beachler assured us that there\u2019s much of Wakanda that we\u2019ve haven\u2019t even seen yet, which will hopefully be made possible by Black Panther\u2019s record-breaking performance at the box office:\n\n\n\nWe designed quite a bit more than you actually see. So hopefully you\u2019ll see other parts of Wakanda that might pop up, because there are several other regions that are pretty spectacular. We have barely even scratched the surface of Wakanda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost important, Beachler told The Glow Up that she hopes young black women and men walk away from this film having seen themselves, and with a stronger interest in filmmaking and a greater sense of their own possibility:", "keywords": ["walks", "studiosdisney", "know", "production", "marvel", "told", "different", "africa", "designer", "panther", "wakanda", "black", "beachler", "hannah", "world", "important"], "polarity": 0.13130909939733473, "subjectivity": 0.5223359646889056},

Now my hair is a few inches past my shoulders and longer and thicker than it ever was when it was relaxed.\n\n\n\nI give all the glory in my natural-hair journey to Lenelle Howell, the person who convinced me to go natural, but who is also the person who used to give me relaxers. I know I\u2019m supposed to give all glory to God, but as a black woman (and an agnostic), the closest thing I know to a deity is Lenelle, my hairdresser. She is my alpha and omega. My comforter in times of need. She is my rock in a weary land, and often\u2014when she finishes a new hairdo\u2014I have screamed \u201cHallelujah\u201d and done a Holy Ghost dance.\n\nI met Lenelle in 2010 when I was in an abusive relationship\u2014with my hair. My strands were broken, abused and in desperate need of some tender loving care. While it sometimes takes stylists a few weeks to get the hang of what a client desires, she immediately knew how to transform my sad-ass strands into something happy and manageable.\n\nInitially, I would wash my hair during off-weeks and have her do my touch-ups, occasionally treating myself to a simple wash-and-set (if I was feeling like a rich bitch). Soon it became painfully obvious which weeks she did my hair and which weeks I did, so eventually I decided not to derail her efforts to make my hair healthy and became a pampered weekly client.\n\nI consistently received compliments on my hair, and my Lenelle addiction got so bad that I\u2019d fly to my out-of-town job during the week and fly home simply to have her do work on my locks. She was like my dealer\u2014I\u2019m now convinced that\u2019s why they call it getting one\u2019s hair \u201cfixed.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am not sure when Lenelle and I crossed over from client and stylist to friends, but we did. She wasn\u2019t just my hair\u2019s caretaker; she provided me with an outlet that facilitated my emotional health on so many days. But shortly after she convinced me to adopt the natural-hair lifestyle (ugh ... I can\u2019t believe I just wrote that), I moved from Orlando, Fla., to Atlanta. Atlanta probably has more natural hairstylists per capita than any other place in the country, but none of them was my hairstylist. It was only after my big move that I realized the space Lenelle occupied in my life, and how much I missed her.\n\nRecently we were on the phone for about a half an hour, but only about five minutes of the conversation centered on my hair. We talked about career, men and life; we caught up like I was sitting in her chair. She said something that really resonated with me: \u201cKyla, people don\u2019t know how sensitive you truly are.\u201d\n\nShe wasn\u2019t talking about my hair.\n\nShe would know. She\u2019s seen me completely break down in her chair when my amour du jour wasn\u2019t acting right. She\u2019s seen me in slumps of feeling unlovable, unappreciated and unsure of my next move in life. She\u2019s been my hairdresser from when I was doing poetry as an out-of-control hobby to when it became my full-time job. She\u2019s been a career counselor, a psychologist and a newfound sister.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor black women, the salon has always been a staple of the community, second only to the black church. Beauty salons and barbershops are the institutional centerpieces of black neighborhoods. They are where people talk politics, get the latest \u201ctea,\u201d network, organize community events and even patronize smaller businesses. If you\u2019re having a party or a protest and you need black people\u2019s help, just go to where they\u2019re getting their hair done.\n\nConsider that Madam C.J. Walker, one of the first black millionaires, was a woman selling hair-care products, and that today, black women spend about nine times as much as their nonblack counterparts on hair-care products, it is safe to say that hair is important to black women. The black hairdresser is the high priestess and No. 1 practitioner of #BlackGirlMagic. She can take the homeliest-looking woman and transform her into a veritable snack. Voil\u00e0\u2014magic!\n\nNot only does a black hairdresser have to be dexterously skilled, but she\u2019s also the gatekeeper to intimate secrets. She is the protector, with \u201cWatch out, I\u2019ve heard about him\u201d certainty. She laughs when it\u2019s time to laugh, and heals when it is time to heal, all while standing on her feet all day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe black salon is a transformation chamber, home to hourly Cinderella stories, where black women can forget the pressures of the world\u2014even if they have to sacrifice hot-ass ears under the dryer.\n\nAfter Lenelle\u2019s intervention, my locks are now out of detox and doing much better. Having natural hair has admittedly saved me a lot of time and money, while making my hair much healthier than when I was addicted to the creamy crack. In the past year, I\u2019ve only gone to the salon twice.\n\nBut I miss my weekly therapy sessions with my counselor. I miss the ritual of sitting on Lenelle\u2019s altar to receive her healing blessings.

His 3a-3b hair has gained him both a hefty social media following and access to some of our female follicle faves, like Nia Light and Bianca Renee Today, sharing hairstyle tutorials or just snapping a perfect photo for the \u2019gram.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut this curly boy is more than just a pretty face; he shares with his followers some of the bullying he endured as a child with long, curly hair\u2014being teased and told he looked like a girl. One of Ferrer\u2019s followers posted a picture of her young son, explaining that he was being teased for his long hair and had been asking to cut it until seeing Ferrer\u2019s page and videos. The golden-hearted guru confirmed that was exactly the reason he started his social media pages: to inspire other young boys to love themselves and ignore the negativity.\n\nWinstonee brings healthy hair habits and style techniques to the gentleman who isn\u2019t looking to grow his strands to the ground. His channel is packed with videos addressing everything from the benefits of apple-cider vinegar to issues with hair growth\u2014and giveaways! He brings a very down-to-earth, approachable style to his tutorials, all while convincing you that he knows his way around a wash-and-go.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSprinkling in some fashion and lifestyle content, Winstonee is on his grind, posting new videos twice a week. This is the perfect guru for men looking to maintain healthy hair and try out new products or styles, all while keeping their coils cropped\u2014and for the ladies who love them.\n\nWith a full crown of curls and on-trend undercuts, Williams is another newbie to the beauty vlog world, posting his first hair video just 10 months ago. But Williams is refreshingly himself on his growing social media platforms. Tackling flat twists, product reviews and hair breakage, this guru-in-training has already offered good insight to men looking to grow and maintain healthy natural hair. We\u2019re definitely keeping our eye on this one, since only a few months in, he is already gaining popularity and showcasing the changing norms of an evolving culture.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom product suggestions to tips on recovering your strands from heat damage, Pearson is all about promoting a healthy hair journey. This rising beauty-vlog star has been growing his fan base since 2011 and was recently featured as a guru fave by Allure magazine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPearson has shared his transition journey from relaxed to natural hair with his followers, using chemicals to straighten his hair for cornrows and braided styles and regretting the damage it did to his hair. He wants to remove the gender headers from beauty and promote the message that black hair is good hair, however we choose to wear it. \u201cHair does not have a gender, and neither should the products,\u201d Pearson commented. \u201cI let my hair speak for itself. When most people watch my videos, they don\u2019t really concern themselves with my gender. What they see first is my mane of healthy hair\u2014healthy black hair, at that!\u201d\n\nThis multiracial (Puerto Rican, African American and white) bilingual beauty (his videos appear in both English and German) is sharing all of his coil tips with his growing subscribers straight from Germany.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an interview with Naturally Curly, Graham shared great advice for men pursuing their journey to healthy natural hair. \u201cHair is not just a girly thing. Men can also have long curly hair. Don\u2019t be ashamed to buy a deep conditioner and a satin scarf, and if someone asks what you want with that ... tell them you are on a healthy hair journey.\u201d This talented content creator recently made the leap to entrepreneur with the release of his own hair-extension line, promoting from his Instagram page. Graham pineapples; he reviews products; he rocks protective styles. We\u2019re in!\n\nOriginally starting his channel to document his locs journey, Barnes is very new to the vlogging world, posting his first video only 10 months ago. An Atlanta-based fitness enthusiast, Barnes is honest about his struggle to live for himself and go after his purpose regardless of any public opinion. With videos on twist-out and stretching techniques posted already, this gentleman is off to a great start in helping men with their questions about grooming and hair care.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a recent video, Barnes leaves his followers with an ever important reminder about loving and living for yourself: \u201cIf we\u2019re always wondering and worried about what other people may think about us, we will never move forward in life and progress.\u201d We hope to see more of this positive personality as he becomes more comfortable sharing his journey.\n\nWhat I love the most about Humphrey\u2019s page is that he takes men\u2019s hair way past the wash-and-go styles we\u2019ve come to expect\u2014trying box braids, Bantu knots and beaded cornrows. With a hilarious personality and \u201cinstant bestie\u201d vibe, Will brings his followers hairstyle tutorials, product suggestions and routine rundowns. He\u2019s also included content around travel, beauty routines and what he calls \u201cshenanigans,\u201d dropping a little something for everyone on his channel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the midst of all the loose-textured, \u201ccurls with just water\u201d vloggers, it\u2019s a breath of fresh air to see tutorials and product reviews targeting kinky coil textures. The best advice we got from Humphrey\u2019s page? \u201cDead ends are like fake friends ... cut them off.\u201d Life and hair goals unite!\n\nBefore we even got to McDonald\u2019s hair tutorials, we wanted to know every single tip this man has about brows. Thankfully, he heard our cry and gave a detailed walkthrough of his shape, cut and clean routine for his full brows as the very first video posted to his channel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince then, McDonald has brought followers along for the ride as he started college, got played by Tinder dates and shared his roommate horror stories. After two years of his life and hair updates (including video cameos with his siblings), we feel as if we\u2019re officially part of the McDonald family. To call this rising star a natural-hair guru seems a bit limiting, since his channel definitely tackles more than just hair tutorials. But we\u2019re glad to see another young voice setting his own standards for beauty and style for men.\n\nCamera-shy, Sheldon is not. Just a short scroll down his feed shows that this fella knows his way around a beauty shot and isn\u2019t new to the \u201cflip and smize\u201d game. This strand star recognizes the dedication (and arm strength) it takes to maintain healthy hair and take on the task of twist-outs and curl techniques.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe also brings a great young perspective to the natural-hair community, using new-gen rappers like Lil Yachty and Travis Scott for hairstyle inspo.

Whennah Andrews of the U.S. Army National Guard tries to hide her braces while showing off her smile. But four years since first advocating against grooming regulations that barred soldiers from wearing natural hairstyles, her smile hints at relief over one of the final steps in the fight for acceptance.\n\nA decade-old ban on dreadlocks is finally coming to an end.\n\n\n\n\u201cAfter all my years of service, I felt like I had a target on my back. I walked a very tight line, but my convictions were more important to me than a paycheck.\u201d \u2014Staff Sgt. Chaunsey Logan\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn Army directive, issued in February, adjusted its grooming policies related to allow dreadlocks\u2014which had been banned since 2005.\n\nThe policy that banned all natural hairstyles, called AR 670-1, first leaked online in 2014. It outlawed twists, braids, cornrows and Afros\u2014styles commonly associated with black women. Andrews first sent them to me before the revisions went public, and after our story sparked months of outrage\u2014including an open letter from the Congressional Black Caucus (pdf) and a review ordered by the Pentagon\u2014the Army reversed course.\n\nIt marked a significant victory for many black female soldiers. But Andrews wasn\u2019t one of them. Despite the Army\u2019s reversal, the ban on dreadlocks remained.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was a setback,\u201d she says. \u201cThere was attention paid to other styles like cornrows and twists, but a lot of people ignored dreadlocks because the mindset was, \u2018Well, they\u2019ve been banned already anyway.\u2019\u201d\n\nBefore, the Army\u2019s vague definition of dreadlocks\u2014including controversial terms like \u201cunkempt\u201d and \u201cmatted\u201d\u2014allowed women with neatly groomed locs to bypass the regulation.\n\n\n\n\u201cLocs being unclean and unkempt is a stereotype that impacts the men and women who wear them,\u201d says popular beauty vlogger Nikky Nwamokobia. In a YouTube video, Andrews and Nwamokobia dispel common myths associated with dreadlocks\u2019 cleanliness and ease of use in the military.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was important for the Army to see that, for many women, locs are their only option to maintain hair without using harsh chemical relaxers, weaves or wigs,\u201d Nwamokobia says.\n\nHundreds of soldiers were faced with a dilemma: Cut their hair, be reprimanded or unenlist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStaff Sgt. Chaunsey Logan of Fort Stewart, Ga., was also one of those soldiers. The 16-year soldier never had any issue since first locking her hair in 2011. But the natural-hair ban meant added scrutiny. After refusing to cut her locs, she faced a dishonorable discharge that would have affected her eligibility for work and education benefits under the GI Bill.\n\n\n\n\u201cAfter all my years of service, I felt like I had a target on my back,\u201d she says. \u201cI walked a very tight line, but my convictions were more important to me than a paycheck.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe was prepared for the worst, but a chance decision to style her locs in a bun during her appeal allowed her to exploit a loophole in the policy. Her hair now looked like Senegalese twists, which are authorized under AR 670-1. An examination of her hair right there in the hearing room determined that Logan was in compliance with the guidelines.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt shows you just how fickle the regulation was,\u201d she says. \u201cTo them, it was just hair, but for me it represented who I am as a black woman.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut even as the military, one of the most conservative institutions in the country, develops more progressive stances on hair, a return to civilian life may invite the same stigmas that dreadlocked servicewomen face while enlisted.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, employees face an uphill battle claiming race-based employment discrimination over their dreadlocks. Even though Title VII of the Civil Rights Act protects against workforce discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex and national origin, hairstyles aren\u2019t included.\n\n\u201cIf the person is Rastafarian, they have much firmer ground for claiming discrimination because it\u2019s generally accepted that they are a part of the religion,\u201d says attorney Arthur R. Ehrlich of the Chicago-based Goldman & Ehrlich law firm, which specializes in employment law and discrimination. Proving race-based discrimination, he says, is trickier because \u201chairstyles are not considered as characteristics associated with race.\u201d\n\nIn late 2016, a federal judge ruled that employees and applicants don\u2019t have a right to wear dreadlocks after a young woman sued Alabama-based Catastrophe Management Solutions for racial discrimination. The insurance company rescinded her job offer after she declined to cut her locs. The EEOC, which represented the applicant, argued \u201cdreadlocks are a manner of wearing the hair that is physiologically and culturally associated with people of African descent.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a 3-0 decision, however, the court disagreed.\n\n\u201cThe fact that I can serve my country with my hair the way God intended it but be denied a job when I return shows just how much work there is left to do.\u201d \u2014Staff Sgt. Chaunsey Logan\n\n\u201cIn the military and civilian world, the ones making these decisions are those who will never have the hair texture or cultural background to understand,\u201d says retired Sgt. Major Donnell Johns. Johns fielded the concerns of many servicewomen, including Andrews, about how to navigate the dreadlocks ban.\u201cThey don\u2019t understand that dreadlocks, like many other black hairstyles, are deeply ingrained in cultural and ethnic identity.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter fighting to keep her dreadlocks, Logan, who has served tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, says that she refuses to take up the battle again in the corporate world. \u201cI rather go back to war than go through that process again,\u201d she says. \u201cThe fact that I can serve my country with my hair the way God intended it but be denied a job when I return shows just how much work there is left to do.\u201d\n\n\n\nFor now, the battle over dreadlocks in the Army may be won, but the war is far from over. Andrews and Nwamokobia have paired up again to take on the only military branch where a dreadlocks ban remains: the Navy. After initial talks, they plan to tackle the Navy\u2019s ban the same way they did the Army: through education. The goal is to enlighten Navy personnel and the public about their ease of use and necessity for black women.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe are currently working on a video for the Navy\u2019s ban on locs,\u201d says Nwamokobia. \u201cWith the military as the role model, we plan on continuing on to corporate America in hopes to continue the momentum of positive and inclusive change.\u201d\n\nDespite a more progressive military, Andrews\u2019 reserved smile fades amid her concern over the hundreds of dreadlocked soldiers who will eventually return to civilian life. But she\u2019s \u201cprepared to fight against stereotypes with the same vigor for women outside the military as those within.\u201d\n\n\n\nEven if, for her, it was too late.\n\n\n\nAndrews, like many other servicewomen, cut her locs prior to the Army\u2019s reversal. While she\u2019s already growing them back, dreadlocks won\u2019t be formally accepted until next year.", "keywords": ["battle", "dreadlocks", "andrews", "hair", "discrimination", "locs", "civilian", "dreadlocked", "acceptance", "ban", "army", "black", "women", "servicewomen", "fight", "military"], "polarity": 0.06786226930963773, "subjectivity": 0.37948849396217815},

Originally based on supermodels Naomi Campbell and Tyra Banks, the Dora were initially conceived not only as female warriors but also as potential wives for the king, whom they\u2019ve pledged to protect, along with the royal family. They were the best and strongest women from the 18 villages within Wakanda and trained at the royal palace.\n\nBut while Priest may in part cite supermodels as his inspiration, there is a historical prototype for the Dora Milaje in the Dahomey \u201cAmazons\u201d\u2014so nicknamed by European colonizers and now known by the French-speaking Beninese as the \u201cN\u2019Nonmiton\u201d (which translates to \u201cour mothers\u201d in Fon).\n\nCreated in the late 17th century by King Wegbaja of the West African nation of Dahomey (now the Republic of Benin) as a group of female hunters known as gbeto, and later expanded by his son King Agaja, the N\u2019Nonmiton were an all-female guard and fighting force. Like the Dora Milaje, the N\u2019Nonmiton were also considered wives of the king, pledging celibacy as well as loyalty and protection to him. And they existed in this role until the colonization of Dahomey in the late 19th century.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can learn all about the incredible female warriors of Dahomey in a 2015 episode of the podcast Stuff You Missed in History Class, and in a very comprehensive comic on their history created by UNESCO for its Series on Women in African History (pdf).

I still don\u2019t think I\u2019ve fully processed or fully understand what impact this movie is going to have on people\u2019s lives. So I\u2019m excited.\u201d \u2014Douriean\n\nJewelry designer and metalsmith Douriean Fletcher\u2014who designs and retails simply as Douriean\u2014is having the kind of breakthrough moment most artists can\u2019t even begin to dream of. Handpicked by friend and legendary costume designer Ruth E. Carter to join the costume team of Black Panther (the two previously worked together on 2016\u2019s Roots), Douriean\u2019s handcrafted jewelry and metalwork adorn the citizens and royalty of Wakanda\u2014perhaps most dazzlingly as the armor and neckpieces of the incredible warrior women of the Dora Milaje.\n\nWatching her own work in action was a thrilling experience, as Douriean told The Glow Up:\n\n\n\nSeeing the movie, it was an absolute joy to see this glistening armor just pop off the screen. ... These Dora characters are the first defense of Wakanda; they\u2019re the ones that defend the honor and the safety of the country. So I think I didn\u2019t really fully process what that meant\u2014that I was creating those pieces\u2014until I saw the movie the other day. The actual craftsmanship of those pieces was a very interesting yet challenging experience ... these pieces have a meaning. They have a specific meaning of who these women are, and what they do for their country. They\u2019re there to be resilient and strong, and to protect Wakanda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m inspired and intrigued by how we choose to represent ourselves as resilient and beautiful and functional, regardless of what we\u2019ve experienced in life.\u201d\n\nDouriean\u2019s handmade, often hand-hammered aesthetic was a perfect match for this newest cinematic corner of the Marvel Universe, which introduces us to the technologically advanced, culturally rich fictional African nation of Wakanda. Douriean, who considers her work not only Afrofuturistic but \u201cAncient Futuristic\u201d or \u201cPrimal Chic,\u201d welcomed the challenge to translate her artistic aesthetic to the big screen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDouriean explained:\n\nI feel like I have a lot of responsibility, first off, to communicate a certain message through my work. I feel like it\u2019s a lot of responsibility, but I think it\u2019s a great position to be in. ... But I think as far as the Marvel Universe, it\u2019s a perfect match because I was able to bring something different to this culture of Wakanda, this fictional country that they had yet to really tap into.\n\nCostume designer Carter agreed, telling The Glow Up that she\u2019d specifically chosen Douriean because she felt strongly that the metal pieces used in Black Panther had to have a \u201chand-tooled African, hand-hammered\u201d aesthetic. That, coupled with director Ryan Coogler\u2019s desire for even the armor to look like beautiful African jewelry, made Douriean the ideal choice. The jewelry designer confessed to us that initially, she held back in deference to the Marvel aesthetic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c[Ruth E. Carter] said, \u2018This isn\u2019t Douriean enough. You have to put more of yourself in it.\u2019 That was exciting. Like, oh, wait, you\u2019re giving me some space to do my thing,\u201d Douriean said.\n\nA Pasadena, Calif., native, Douriean has been creating jewelry since 2010. She is mostly self-taught, save for a three-month metalsmithing class in New Orleans. Having traveled throughout Tanzania and South Africa and now based in Los Angeles, she makes work that \u201cexplores cultural identity, femininity, spirituality and divine power.\u201d When asked where she gleans her inspiration, she told The Glow Up:\n\n\n\nSometimes it\u2019s my story; if I experience something that\u2019s quite challenging, I\u2019ll take inspiration from that\u2014and, sometimes, motivation from those experiences\u2014and put that into a piece. Sometimes I literally just have dreams, and I wake up in the middle of night and sketch them out. And sometimes other people\u2019s stories, or just their essence ... women, we\u2019re very multifaceted creatures. So I\u2019m inspired and intrigued by how we choose to represent ourselves as resilient and beautiful and functional, regardless of what we\u2019ve experienced in life. ... The physique of a woman is very beautiful, and I want\u2014whenever I create something\u2014to be able to adorn someone to where they feel regal and beautiful and powerful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a female metalsmith, Douriean admitted that her eight-year journey has been a challenge, as there aren\u2019t many women in the field, let alone black women. But she credits the obstacles with her growth as an artist and innovator:\n\n\n\nI feel like I\u2019ve been underestimated at times; people are just surprised that I can create what I do, or doubt that I can create what I make. And because it\u2019s so different from what people think when they think of jewelry-making, it\u2019s been a challenge to find my niche and my clientele. Like this whole entire process, like this is the first time\u2014these past two years\u2014where I feel like I\u2019ve finally found my tribe and my clientele of people who can understand and accept my work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith that growth and increasing exposure have come major shifts for Douriean, especially as the officially licensed jewelry designer for both Black Panther and the upcoming Avengers film, which promises to be an even larger production. While creating for mass market raises her exposure and reach, it definitely presented challenges to her typically one-of-a-kind approach to design. According to Douriean:\n\nAs an artist, I like to create one-offs\u2014I like to create one thing, it has a story to it, it means something and it\u2019s for one particular person. To be able to have to expand that, and create a narrative for a group of people, it\u2019s a different way of approaching my work. So, for instance, the Black Panther line ... I created that, number one, for the comic book fan; the young men and women or the young boys and girls who grew up on the comics, who are super excited, who have been waiting for this moment for years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor those of us coveting a piece of Black Panther to take home, the sterling silver Black Panther collection is currently available on Douriean\u2019s website. A collection inspired by Panther villain Killmonger is next, and lastly, a collection inspired by the Dora Milaje, which Douriean will handcraft herself.\n\nThe Glow Up caught a preview of both Lupita Nyong\u2019o and the designer herself at the Marvel Studios Black Panther Welcome to Wakanda New York Fashion Week presentation on Monday. Frankly, we can\u2019t wait to see if 24-karat-gold neck rings and epaulets are in our futures. The designer was coy:\n\n\u201cI wanted the Dora pieces to be very special, so I\u2019m handcrafting all of those. So it\u2019s coming. It\u2019s coming,\u201d she told us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut right now, Douriean is just savoring the moment and trying to process how it feels to become part of cinematic history:", "keywords": ["think", "metal", "jewelry", "work", "designer", "douriean", "create", "armored", "feel", "panther", "heavy", "women", "black", "adorned", "jeweler"], "polarity": 0.2566777954749653, "subjectivity": 0.5426845952789348},

In July 2016, a news story went viral about a school in Pretoria, South Africa, banning black girls from wearing natural hairstyles like Afros because they were \u201cuntidy\u201d and \u201cunladylike.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn March 2017, twins Grace and Thabisa, who are of South Sudanese descent, were pulled out of their classes at Bentleigh Seconday School in Melbourne, Australia, and told to remove their braids because it didn\u2019t \u201crepresent the school.\u201d After an uproar from parents who said the policy was an attack on African culture, the girls were allowed to return to school.\n\nLast week, there was a story about twins Maya and Deanna Cook, students at Mystic Valley Regional Charter School in Malden, Mass., who were kicked off their sports teams and prohibited from attending a prom because they wore their hair in braids.\n\nThe school said that the girls were in violation of the dress code for wearing their hair in an \u201cunnatural\u201d way, which includes braids. The girls were also placed in detention for two weeks for refusing to change their hair, and other black students were singled out for hair inspections.\n\nNews outlets reported this week that at Montverde Academy in Lake County, Fla., school administrators asked Nicole Orr, a 16-year-old black student, to change her natural hair because it was against the dress code. In both cases, school administrators contacted the parents first to ask them to \u201ccorrect\u201d the teens\u2019 hair. In Nicole\u2019s case, administrators cited the need for \u201cneat\u201d and \u201cclean\u201d hair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat black people in general and black girls specifically are being targeted by these discriminatory practices because of \u201cneatness\u201d and \u201ccleanliness\u201d is laughable. It is common knowledge that hair lice is a major problem with white schoolchildren, particularly in elementary schools. Thousands of letters go out to parents each year regarding lice outbreaks, and some parents complain that children with lice are sometimes allowed to stay in school, as was the case in Arlington, Va., in 2014.\n\nMany environmentalists, some of whom are students, believe that taking fewer showers saves water, which is true. This practice, however, also means that people are often subjected to foul bodily odors as well as dirty hair, which can be oily, greasy and downright smelly.\n\nAs a college professor, I encounter all kinds of folks. It has never occurred to me to file lawsuits against my students or colleagues, or to lobby for policies to put an end to this practice. If they\u2019re cool with having hair that sometimes smells like a combination of garlic bologna, dogs caught in rainstorms and formaldehyde, then so be it. In my head, I call it \u201ceau de funk for our future,\u201d and simply suck it up. So why are black people in general and black girls specifically being targeted?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Petty Pendergrass in me thinks that some folks are jealous because they don\u2019t have the versatility that natural hair affords black women. We can loc, twist, cut, grow, curl, weave, braid, shave\u2014pretty much do anything we want with it and look good doing it. If natural hairstyles worn by black girls are so bad, then why are white celebrities like Fergie, David Beckham, Juliette Lewis and the Kardashians celebrated for wearing them?\n\nThe academic in me knows that there\u2019s something more occurring: the targeting of black girls for whatever infraction\u2014perceived or real\u2014of normative worldwide behavior. Historically, the bodies of young black girls have been policed, touched, harassed and violated\u2014legally. See slavery. See segregation. See the civil rights era. See the post-civil-rights era. See the new millennium. See Halle Berry\u2019s unwanted kiss from Adrien Brody at the 2003 Academy Awards. See the kidnapped girls of Chibok, Nigeria. If you think that a focus on people touching black women inappropriately, especially when it comes to our hair, is a stretch, then listen to Solange\u2019s song \u201cDon\u2019t Touch My Hair\u201d for a recent testimony.\n\nWhat is happening to our girls now is not a stretch. In fact, it is part of the fabric of our country and its institutions. In September 2016, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in a lawsuit filed against Catastrophe Management Solutions, effectively ruling that refusing to hire someone because he or she wears dreadlocks is legal. Out of all the hairstyles people wear in this country, dreadlocks\u2014a natural hairstyle that is sometimes worn for religious purposes, sometimes for fashion or for personal expression\u2014were singled out.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDiscriminating against people with \u201cnatural\u201d or \u201cblack\u201d hair cuts across many categories, including race, class, gender and nationality. Singling out and discriminating against black women for natural hairstyles like locs and twists is quite common, in fact. In 2014, Ayana Byrd and Lori L. Tharp wrote an article for the New York Times entitled, \u201cWhen Black Hair Is Against the Rules,\u201d detailing the long history of discrimination by U.S. institutions against black hairstyles. The article came out just as the U.S. Army\u2019s grooming policies, some of which specifically targeted black women\u2019s natural hairstyles, including dreadlocks, were being revised by then-Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel after the Congressional Black Caucus, led by Rep. Marcia Fudge (D-Ohio), requested the revision.\n\nReportedly, there was a lot of confusion about the rules because many officers had trouble differentiating among locs, twists and cornrows. Despite the federal circuit court\u2019s ruling in 2016 allowing discrimination in hiring against blacks with dreadlocks, the U.S. Army lifted the ban on locs, ending years of \u201cscrutiny and confusing enforcement of rules about their appearance,\u201d in February 2017.\n\nEven though the Army could have continued to legally enforce the policy as a requirement for employment, it chose to do the opposite. Why? Because singling out one group of people for something like hair is demoralizing, abusive and unnecessary. How do you ask people to die for their country but then give them grief over the actual hair growing out of their scalps? The answer is, you don\u2019t, because, wait for it: It\u2019s the right thing to do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is happening to these young black girls in schools is what happens when a federal circuit court makes it OK to discriminate against black people with natural hair in the workplace. Those in positions of authority at these schools think it is their right to swap one environment for another and pick on black girls because of their \u201cunnatural\u201d natural hair.\n\nThe only thing \u201cunnatural\u201d about the situation is that so-called educators would try to enlist Nicole Orr\u2019s parents in an attempt to socially isolate her; assault her psyche, self-identity and self-esteem; and demand that she change her beautiful head of hair. What\u2019s natural about that?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeing a parent is hard in general, but being the parent of a black child is exhausting. Why? Because we always have to worry about someone messing with our children for no reason other than that they\u2019re black. We are always managing the expectations of others, including how our children should look in order to be palatable to them. Unfortunately, black parents also have to worry about our children being harassed, bullied or publicly humiliated by adults\u2014grown people with academic degrees and all sorts of training, who should know better and do better.\n\nAs an educator and the mother of a black girl whose hair is natural and will remain so until she is old enough to decide otherwise, I would ask these adults to please take their hands and policies out of our daughters\u2019 hair. In the words of India.Arie, black girls are not their skin, hair or your expectations. They are girls\u2014human beings\u2014who deserve to be educated without being degraded, publicly ridiculed or humiliated. Let go of archaic ideas about black people, let go of ridiculous policies about black hair and let go of the need to constantly police black bodies, especially black girls. For God\u2019s sake, let our girls be girls, and let our girls learn.\n\n", "keywords": ["natural", "hair", "let", "school", "hairstyles", "learn", "girls", "black", "parents", "wearing", "students"], "polarity": 0.005687039568618517, "subjectivity": 0.4251841725525933},

And I don\u2019t mean in a political kind of way. I mean the sense of culture and community that surrounds how we groom our luscious locks, regardless of how we choose to treat or style them. That is whether they\u2019re permed, natural, weaved, in dreadlocks or up in box braids.\n\nAt any given point you can find a black woman commenting on another black woman\u2019s hair.\n\n\u201cI love that style, where did you get your hair done?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere did you buy that hair, girl?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat products do you use?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do you get your locs so curly?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow many packs of hair did it take to get your braids like that?\u201d\n\nThe conversations can be endless. There are countless YouTube channels, blogs, social media pages, etc., dedicated to helping black women find #HairInspo, showing them wash routines and styling techniques and reviewing hair products.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut now there\u2019s an app for that. Three black software engineers and entrepreneurs\u2014Cassandra Sarfo, Esther Olatunde and Priscilla Hazel\u2014have created Tress, an app they hope will become the one-stop shop for all your black hair needs, inspirations and appointments.\n\n\u201cWe do this all the time: We see a hairstyle that we like. We stop people on the street just to ask them where they did their hair, how much it cost them, or ask them for their stylist\u2019s number,\u201d Hazel told The Root. \u201cAnd my mom, she takes pictures of her TV screen and [messages] me and asks me where she can have it done. It\u2019s a habit that we have that we do all the time.\u201d\n\nSo the women put their heads together to come up with a solution for what they saw as an obvious demand, and the app Tress was born. The long-term goal is to make Tress a one-stop shop for all things hair, and for the platform to be a seamless integration between someone seeing a hairstyle and knowing all the products and procedures (and even people!) used to create it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs it stands now, the search starts on the street or on social media with someone loving a hairstyle. Then maybe they have to search for tutorials on how to style the hair, or where to purchase specific products or extensions. Then it\u2019s a matter of, can this be done with your own two hands, or should you put your life in a stylist\u2019s hands?\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re constantly moving from one platform to the other, trying to figure out how to get information on one style you want to get done. So, for us, we thought it\u2019d be cool if we could just build a platform where you can actually come and find hairstyle inspiration, interact with people who post their hairstyle, be able to purchase products for those particular hairstyles and then eventually be able to book stylists all on one platform,\u201d Hazel said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCurrently on the app, women can find hair inspo and filter hairstyles by the type they\u2019re looking for, or even by cost. Women can also upload and share photos of their own hairstyle, adding whatever information is necessary, and contribute to community discussions about best hair-care practices and other tips. You can see what\u2019s trending, and even bookmark hairstyles for later viewing.\n\n\n\nThe women behind the app hope that within the next six to eight months, users will be able to purchase products through the app directly. A little further into the future, the next priority will be enabling women to book hairstylists.\n\n\u201cWe want to be very city-focused.

She found an emollient\u2014and affordable\u2014solution in Vaseline Cocoa Radiant Smoothing Body Butter.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m kind of obsessed with it. It\u2019s very hydrating\u2014like, super hydrating,\u201d she said. \u201cI was mixing pigments into it, to get the hydration with shimmer, too ... her skin reflecting is really all I\u2019m going for.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd if you\u2019re shocked to find out that one of your faves has found a new favorite in the drugstore aisle, the key is in how hydrating Vaseline\u2019s formula is, aside from its delicious scent.\n\n\n\n\u201c[Issa]\u2019s a big fan of anything that\u2019s really hydrating, and she really likes it,\u201d Simkin said. \u201cI like the finish on it\u2014when we put it on, I felt like her skin was gleaming, without looking like I had oiled her.

Some butches may look forward to the Super Bowl (I\u2019m personally planning to hate-watch Justin Timberlake\u2019s halftime show), but I look forward to awards season because: red carpets!\n\nListen, I\u2019ve spent most of my life watching hundreds of hours of Project Runway and awards shows, so I consider myself an armchair stylist/designer (that\u2019s a thing, right?). Besides, who can say no to spending hours discussing past Golden Globes dresses, trends and red-carpet-winning looks? Not this stud!\n\n\n\nSince they clearly forgot my ticket to the actual show, tonight I plan to attend The Glow Up\u2019s Facebook party while also hanging out with Black Twitter\u2014 because you can\u2019t outdo black people. So while I wash my \u201cI\u2019m Rooting For Everybody Black\u201d T-shirt and plan my snacks, let\u2019s get into my top five expectations for the Golden Globes red carpet and telecast!\n\n1. Serving Face\n\nThe red carpet is about an all-around look, but the face is just as important as the dress. As the kids say, a beat face does wonders. Plus, part of the face is the look that ladies on the carpet can give reporters who don\u2019t ask actual questions. Yes, I want to know who she\u2019s wearing, but she\u2019s also there for an accomplishment\u2014not who she\u2019s dating. Ask better questions. In any case, a good contour matched with a shady smile will make all the difference in the world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Raise Your Hands for Natural Hair\n\nListen ... I used to live in the house of creamy crack (relaxers, for those who don\u2019t know), but there\u2019s nothing like a good natural braided style or mini \u2019fro or even a blowout that can take my breath away. Remember Janelle Mon\u00e1e\u2019s hair at last year\u2019s Screen Actor Guild Awards? Or Taraji P. Henson\u2019s do on the Black Girls Rock! red carpet? Or my queer sister Lena Waithe\u2019s intricate braided style at the Primetime Emmys? Natural hair on the red carpet reminds young black women that the hair that grows out of our heads is one of the most beautiful and desirable accessories we have in our arsenal of #BlackGirlMagic tricks.\n\n3. Staying on Message\n\nThis Globes is political. Since the public explosion of sexual assault and harassment allegations against Harvey Weinstein and countless others, this will be the first time Hollywood is getting together en masse to celebrate itself. No doubt the mood in the Beverly Hilton might shift from the normal party atmosphere to a more somber evening.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd of course, many are writing about what wearing black on the red carpet will do for the the #TimesUp movement that initiated it and the #MeToo movement founded by Tarana Burke. Will Hollywood stars wearing black really mean something to survivors, or will it come across as self-serving (side-eying you, Rose McGowan)? We also know sexual assault and harassment is not a single-gender issue, so, for folks who do decide to wear black in protest on the red carpet, I hope they\u2019ll be mindful of gendered language when discussing the impact of sexual assault, harassment and violence.\n\n4. More Amy Poehler and Tina Fey\u2014Sorry, Seth Meyers\n\nI\u2019ll be highly surprised if I actually like the monologue. I mean, who can top Amy Poehler and Tina Fey? Probably somebody like Tiffany Haddish. But this year, we\u2019ve got Seth Meyers, which in some ways feels a little off for me. Considering that Hollywood is having its \u201cCome to Jesus\u201d moment, I wonder if maybe this is a bit tone-deaf for the current moment that we\u2019re in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNevertheless, I\u2019m going to miss the \u201cgirl power\u201d of Poehler and Fey, and hope the handling of Hollywood\u2019s emerging scandals will be done with unbridled realness, because that\u2019s what\u2019s needed to break the ice in the room. Let\u2019s get real about what is happening\u2014not just in Hollywood, but in our culture as a whole. Honesty on Meyers\u2019 part might help his fellow dude-bros hear what women, in particular, have been saying for years about the ways in which we are silenced. I\u2019d also really love to see him tell people to straight up stop working with Woody Allen. But I\u2019m pretty sure that won\u2019t happen.\n\n5. Black Excellence\n\nWith this year\u2019s sparse nominations of black actors, I\u2019m hoping to see wins in every category in which a black person is nominated. Yep, I\u2019m rooting for everybody black. The Glow Up\u2019s #ThrowbackThursday: Golden Globes Edition got me hyped for all of that beautiful black excellence that will grace the red carpet! And if you\u2019re a black woman who wins an award, it\u2019s at least guaranteed that Taraji P. Henson will celebrate you, because that\u2019s #Sisterhood (crossing my fingers, because I\u2019d love to see that Issa Rae/Taraji P. Henson moment).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#ThrowbackThursday: Golden Globes Edition No shade to Christmas, but here at The Glow Up, it\u2019s the most wonderful time of year\u2014except Fashion \u2026 Read more Read\n\nAre you ready?
