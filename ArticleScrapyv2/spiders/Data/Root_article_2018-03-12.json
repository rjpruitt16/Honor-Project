It\u2019s still the most popular on Facebook and most emailed,\u201d she messaged.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Caroline Linton reported Thursday for CBS News, \u201cIda B. Wells, who was born a slave in 1862 and went on to become the most famous black woman of her time as a journalist and civil rights activist, never had an obituary in The New York Times. Neither did accomplished authors Sylvia Plath or Charlotte Bront\u00eb, or photographer Diane Arbus. They are among the women highlighted in a new series called \u2018Overlooked\u2019 that will publish obituaries for women who were not singled out for the honor at the time.\n\n\u201cThe first set of obituaries were rolled out March 8 \u2014 International Women\u2019s Day. New York Times national reporter Caitlin Dickerson, who wrote Wells\u2019 obituary, told CBSN\u2019s Elaine Quijano the paper is \u2018acknowledging now that the New York Times was, quite honestly, part of the problem.\u2019\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c \u2018The New York Times is the paper of record \u2014 it always, to a certain extent, reflected the culture of the moment,\u2019 Dickerson said. \u2018When we talk about Ida B. Wells, for example, born in the 1860s, we\u2019re talking about a moment when we, as a general culture, didn\u2019t pay attention to African Americans \u2014 especially African American women.\u2019\n\n\u201cDickerson said \u2018everybody in the building\u2019 was eager to be involved. \u2018I think this is going to be a rolling project,\u2019 Dickerson said.\n\n\u201cThe interest, Dickerson noted, reflects how important the issues of gender and inequality are even in a time of fast-breaking news. As Quijano pointed out, even in the last two years, only 20 percent of obituaries are written about women. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichael McCann, Sports Illustrated: Breaking Down Adrienne Lawrence\u2019s Lawsuit Against ESPN and the Company\u2019s Possible Defenses\n\nD.

RSF has established that from 2012 to 2017, the rights of at least 90 journalists in around 20 countries were seriously violated because they dared to cover or talk about women\u2019s rights or gender issues.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSeveral months of research has yielded the following chilling breakdown of these cases: 11 of these journalists were murdered, 12 were imprisoned, at least 25 were physically attacked, and at least 40 others were or are still being threatened on social networks.\n\n\u201cIn India, Gauri Lankesh, the editor of the secular and feminist weekly Gauri Lankesh Patrike, paid with her life for articles that criticized the woman\u2019s place in the caste system. She was gunned down on September 5, 2017. In Iran, many feminist journalists have been subjected to judicial harassment and imprisonment in connection with their writing.\n\n\u201cThey include Mansoureh Shojaee, who now lives in exile, and Narges Mohammadi, who is still detained. However, it is not just women journalists who are persecuted by the enemies of women\u2019s rights. In Somalia, Abdiaziz Abdinur Ibrahim was arrested and sentenced to a year in prison on a fake news charge after he interviewed a rape victim. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJacquelyn Iyamah, Committee to Protect Journalists: On International Women\u2019s Day, CPJ looks at threats women journalists face\n\nTo have authenticity in the #newsroom, you need power.Black/POC journalists are often not empowered to change the newsroom.

Only a quarter of Latino heads of household own their own homes in the state, compared to 69 percent of whites \u2014 the largest divide nationwide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBlack households in Massachusetts, by comparison, have a median income of $46,381, and 34 percent own homes.\n\n\u201cLanguage barriers and immigration status play a major role in the inequity \u2014 here and across the country \u2014 making it difficult for Latinos to progress beyond low-wage jobs or speak up about unfair treatment.\n\n\u201cBut there are added challenges in Massachusetts: a high cost of living and a majority of jobs that require college education, along with long waiting lists for English classes and a 15-year-old law \u2014 effectively overturned a few months ago \u2014 that eliminated bilingual education from most public schools. There are also relatively few Latino leaders and nonprofits, leading to low levels of civic engagement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPuerto Ricans, the largest group of Latinos in the state, struggle more than most, with fewer of them working or in school than among other Latino sub-populations.\n\n\u201cThen there\u2019s Boston\u2019s history of discrimination against black people, which dominates discussions about race.\n\n\u201c \u2018There\u2019s that feeling of, you\u2019re African-American or you\u2019re white, but there\u2019s no in-between,\u2019 said a Boston Police Department officer of Puerto Rican heritage who asked not to be identified. \u2018We\u2019re almost like the folks that nobody pays attention to.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAs a number of Latinos put it: They feel invisible here. . . .\u201d\n\nJohn Eggerton, Broadcasting & Cable: FCC to Help Fund Network Rebuilds in Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands\n\nLester Holt Didn\u2019t \u2018Want to Be Defined by My Color\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsked about being the first African American solo anchor of a weekday network nightly newscast, Lester Holt said he was honored and inspired by the impact of his career beyond the anchor desk, Chandelis R. Duster reported Feb. 28 for NBCBLK.\n\n\u201c \u2018Kids can now look around and see someone who looks like them on TV,\u2019 he said at New York\u2019s Paley Center for Media as \u201cNBC Nightly News\u201d celebrated 70 years.\n\n\u201cSaying he himself was inspired by journalists like Bernard Shaw, Bryant Gumbel, and others, Holt reflected on the impact of African-Americans in media. He also spoke of challenges he faced as a journalist of color.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c \u2018There were periods of my career where there was just pressure to define myself as a black journalist and I pushed back at that because I knew I wanted to succeed and not be defined by my color,\u2019 Holt said. \u2018I think if any of us are going to succeed, it\u2019s going to be on a broad scale.\u2019 . . .\u201d\n\nNevertheless, a major career break for Holt came as a result of pressure from African Americans pushing for diversity. He \u201clives by the words a mentor once said to him early in his career: Prepare yourself to walk through doors of opportunity that will swing open when you least expect them to,\u201d Stephen Battaglio wrote in 2015 for the Los Angeles Times.\n\n\u201cIt first happened to Holt in 1986, when he landed a major local TV anchor job. He got the gig after CBS\u2019 Chicago station WBBM demoted longtime anchor Harry Porterfield, removing an African American from the lineup of a station that had little diversity on its weekday newscasts. The Rev. Jesse Jackson and Operation PUSH led a 10-month boycott against WBBM, and Holt was moved from WCBS in New York to take over one of the nightly newscasts in Chicago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c \u2018I got that call and I was 27 years old,\u2019 Holt said. \u2018There was a tremendous amount of pressure. I didn\u2019t realize how much pressure it was going to be. \u2018 . . .\u201d\n\nVariety: Lester Holt Looks Back \u2014 and Forward \u2014 as \u2018NBC Nightly News\u2019 Celebrates 70 Years\n\nSmith Joins Hill in Leaving \u2018SportsCenter\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSports Illustrated has learned that Michael Smith\u2019s last day as an ESPN SportsCenter host will be Friday,\u201d Richard Deitsch reported Thursday for Sports Illustrated.\n\n\n\n\u201cSmith leaving the 6 p.m. SC6 edition of SportsCenter follows his former SportsCenter co-anchor Jemele Hill\u2019s decision to depart the franchise to join the staff of The Undefeated, the ESPN microsite that fuses sports, race and culture, as well as other additional assignments.\n\n\u201cBoth Hill and Smith have multiple years left on their ESPN contracts so look for Smith to craft a new role at ESPN over the next couple of months.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAs this column wrote in October when it predicted Hill\u2019s tenure as the co-host of the 6 p.m. ET edition of SportsCenter would end, Smith leaving SportsCenter is not a surprise. The SportsCenter that Hill and Smith envisioned, what made their chemistry honest and unique on the ESPN2 show His and Hers and their podcasts together, had slowly been chopped away by a desire from management to change that show to that of a traditional SportsCenter. . . .\u201d\n\nIvie E. Ani, OkayPlayer: Michael Smith Opens Up About How He And Jemele Hill Were Treated By ESPN\n\nExperts Advise on Covering White Nationalists\n\n\u201cFor months before the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville [in August], news outlets had been profiling the emboldened racist extremists who had celebrated the election of Donald Trump,\u201d Lois Beckett and Jesse Brenneman reported Monday for the Guardian. \u201cThe coverage had often sparked backlash, with readers across the political spectrum arguing that fringe racists were being given too much of a platform, and that media coverage was blowing their influence out of proportion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cCharlottesville made clear that far-right groups were a serious, violent threat. But it did not put an end to the debates over media coverage of these groups \u2014 and the fierce criticism when news organizations produced coverage that readers saw as too \u2018normalizing\u2019.\n\n\u201cGuardian US and WNYC\u2019s On the Media have collaborated on a radio episode looking at these debates over the coverage of America\u2019s emboldened racist extremists. How should news organizations cover neo-Nazi and white nationalist groups? What does it take to cover them accurately \u2014 without simply giving them a platform for their ideas?\n\n\u201cThe episode brings together historians of American racism with seven reporters who have covered the far right over the past year. Together, they weigh in on the common mistakes journalists and editors make \u2014 and the false assumptions about racism at the root of many of these errors. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nParticipants include: Elle Reeve, correspondent for VICE News; Anna Merlan, reporter for Gizmodo Media\u2019s special projects desk; Vegas Tenold, journalist and author of \u201cEverything You Love Will Burn\u201d; Al Letson, host of Reveal, from the Center for Investigative Reporting; Felix Harcourt, professor of history at Austin College and author of \u201cKu Klux Kulture\u201d; Gary Younge, editor-at-large for the Guardian; Josh Harkinson , former senior writer at Mother Jones; and Ibram X.

Once press got ahold of the news, it was quickly deleted. Then, on Wednesday, Billboard reported that two anonymous sources confirmed that the tour was definitely real, but Bey couldn\u2019t announce until after Coachella\u2014but that was it. More gossip? Not a lot to go off of until today.\n\nThis morning Beyonc\u00e9 shared what we can assume are the first of a series of tour images and video teasers on her official Instagram page.

Dennis Rodman. Rodman\u2014the tattooed, onetime drug addict-and-onetime basketball player-turned-reformed drug addict, whose temperament can best be described as a faulty shredded trip wire on its last thread\u2014has the distinguished privilege of being one of the few men alive to be friends with both the combustible leader of North Korea and the dotard president of the United States.\n\n\n\nLike a father who doesn\u2019t respect his teen\u2019s privacy, Donald Trump apparently stuck his head inside a White House press briefing Thursday to announce that major news was coming.\n\nThat news was that the president of the United States and the leader of North Korea\u2014two men who\u2019ve literally gotten into a full-on nuclear dick-measuring contest on social media\u2014are going to meet, and I don\u2019t want anything to happen unless Dennis Rodman is there.\n\n\u201cWell done, President Trump. You\u2019re on the way to a historical meeting no U.S. president has ever done,\u201d the former NBA star told the Associated Press after news broke Thursday of the meeting.\n\nNPR reports that Trump\u2019s visit will be the first time a sitting president has ever met with a North Korean leader. Former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton visited, in 1994 and 2009, respectively, but only after they\u2019d left office.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRodman also added an alarming message to the president that immediately gave some of us pause: \u201cPlease send my regards to Marshal Kim Jong Un and his family.\u201d\n\nWait, a trip to North Korea is planned without Rodman? Why!? I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a good thing or a horrible thing, but Rodman might be the only American whom Kim actually respects. At this point, I understand that the idea of Trump and Rodman on Air Force One going to visit Kim sounds like a really bad movie idea, but seriously, why would the president ever travel to visit a man who\u2019s reportedly responsible for some 340 deaths under his reign without bringing his best black friend? The Trump administration even claimed that Kim was responsible for the death of his own half-brother Kim Jong-nam!\u2014who, I\u2019ll have you recall, was killed in some really slick 24-type shit.\n\nHere\u2019s how PBS described the half-brother\u2019s death:\n\nKim Jong-nam was attacked in a Malaysian airport in February 2017 when two women approached him and smeared his face with VX nerve agent. VX, one of the most lethal chemical weapons in existence, is banned under the international Chemical Weapons Convention. At the time of the attack, Kim was carrying the antidote to the nerve agent that killed him, as well as $124,000 in cash.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis meeting is just a really stupid move from a really stupid administration. Kim has been a boisterous threat since taking office, but he\u2019s remained a far-off threat, and agreeing to meet with him could have disastrous ramifications. The only way a sitting president should ever meet with this little dictator is if he\u2019s accompanied by one of the best rebounders in the history of the NBA.

One weapon Putin described as a \u201clow-flying, difficult-to-spot cruise missile ... with a practically unlimited range and an unpredictable flight path, which can bypass lines of interception and is invincible in the face of all existing and future systems of both missile defense and air defense,\u201d the BBC reports.\n\nIn true Putin fashion, he didn\u2019t actually show the weapons, which all sound like the nuclear equivalent of a shark carrying an alligator on its back. According to Putin, who lies about as much as the current U.S. president, Russia has crafted undetectable weapons that can do all kinds of amazing destruction, and America better pay attention!\n\nHere\u2019s how Business Insider described the Russian unveiling of mass destruction:\n\nA computer-generated animation accompanied each weapon announcement, perhaps illustrating that they exist mainly in a conceptual state. First, Putin mentioned a new intercontinental ballistic, which he claimed had unlimited range and could get past all US missile defenses. An animation showed the missile taking two trajectories toward the West. Without showing much real video of the product, Putin said \u201cour defense companies have launched mass production of this new system.\u201d Next, Putin announced what he called a \u201cglobal cruise missile,\u201d which he claimed had unlimited range and was nuclear-propelled. An animation showed the missile fired from Russia\u2019s north, flying north of Europe into the Atlantic, weaving through US air-defense zones, and then inexplicably traveling south the entire length of the Atlantic Ocean before wrapping around Argentina and ending up near Chile. Then, Putin seemed to confirm a long-feared \u201cdoomsday\u201d weapon: an unmanned, undersea vehicle capable of carrying a nuclear weapon across oceans at high speeds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile it may have only been computer-generated destruction of the West, it proves that Russia is not our friend, so it may be time for President Donald Trump to stop emailing Putin about which workout classes he\u2019s taking and how he makes his three-bean chili dip, and start treating Russia like the threat it has always been.\n\n\u201cThey kept ignoring us,\u201d Putin said of the West, to a standing ovation, Business Insider reports. \u201cNobody wanted to listen to us, so listen to us now.\u201d", "keywords": ["weapons", "russia", "claims", "missile", "putin", "weapon", "president", "cant", "defense", "trump", "intercepted", "come", "vladimir", "claimed", "nuclear", "west"], "polarity": 0.1048030303030303, "subjectivity": 0.40401010101010104},

It is as inevitable as dusk and dawn at this point. It\u2019s going to happen. We just have to wonder what that news is going to be.\n\nOn Wednesday the New York Times reported that Donald Trump has twice questioned witnesses about their discussions with special counsel Robert Mueller pertaining to the Russia investigation.\n\nIn the first instance, Trump is reported to have told a White House aide that White House counsel Donald F. McGahn II should issue a denial of a January Times article that said McGahn told investigators that the president asked him to fire Mueller.\n\nMcGahn not only did not issue the denial but reportedly later reminded the president that he had, in fact, asked McGahn to fire Mueller.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump is also alleged to have asked former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus how his interview had gone with investigators from the Mueller probe.\n\nIt bears repeating that if this were Barack Obama, they would have ousted him from the White House already.\n\nWhy does Donald Trump continue to get a pass?\n\nThis ho is acting up, and this Congress is letting him.\n\nYou have to wonder what it is going to take to get the impeachment process started, because Trump has demonstrated time and time again that he has no business in the Oval Office.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe does not even care about this country.

It is a big part of my personality, and it is something that often happens without me being conscious of it.\n\n\n\nFor the most part it is harmless. I\u2019m not going to lie\u2014I have used flirting to my advantage to get my way in public with both men and women. It\u2019s a thing that I do.\n\nThat said, when my flirting has intention behind it, you will know. It\u2019s a different kind of flirting. Flirting with a purpose has a different type of energy, and that difference is noticeable.\n\nI\u2019m inclined to think that most flirting is of the simple, harmless sort\u2014but could it still be considered a form of cheating?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking solely for myself, I would say that the answer to that question depends on the intention and the intensity behind the flirting.\n\nI have had partners flirt before\u2014in front of me, even\u2014and it never bothered me because I knew it was harmless. They weren\u2019t trying to hook up with anyone on the low or make someone have more interest in them than what was there already.\n\nThe other side of that, of course, is when the person doing the flirting has the goal of creating something with the other person\u2014even if what they are creating is simply a situation in which there will be more consistent flirting between the two parties. That is a level of inappropriateness that would give me cause for concern.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI asked this question on Twitter and took a poll. The vast majority of people who responded said \u201cit depends,\u201d which I take to mean basically the same thing I\u2019ve already touched on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt depends on your circumstances and the boundaries you have set with your partner. If you are OK with flirting as long as it goes no further, then so be it.\n\nIf, on the other hand, your trust in your partner is shaky, then flirting could be an issue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInsecurity is real, and it could be disastrous if you are already even the tiniest bit insecure about your partner flirting with another person.\n\nThere are people who believe that you only flirt when you are interested in another person and you are entertaining their interest in you. If this is the case, then it is a form of cheating. It is a betrayal of trust.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is ultimately a topic that not everyone is going to agree on, because not everyone views flirting in the same way. It is a deeply personal thing that varies from relationship to relationship.\n\nSo the next time you are having pillow talk with your partner, have a dialogue with them about it. Be open and honest about your definition of flirting, and ask them theirs. Then the two of you will be able to decide together.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs flirting a form of cheating?\n\nThe short answer: It can be.\n\nWe will be discussing flirting when The Root After Dark Twitter chat returns on Tuesday at 11 p.m. ET/8 p.m. PT.

But the news cycle that seems to find Russia under every rock has become too repetitive and overwhelming for me to bear any longer.\n\nWithout question, it\u2019s clear that Moscow tried to exploit Americans\u2019 political views through social media during the 2016 presidential election. Not only have America\u2019s intelligence communities determined as much, but the heads of the social media platforms that Russian-backed entities exploited concur. Donald Trump\u2019s inner circle\u2014be it his former national security adviser Mike Flynn or ex-campaign manager Paul Manafort\u2014have ties to Moscow that point to possible collusion.\n\nJulia Ioffe of The Atlantic recently reported that Donald Trump Jr. communicated with WikiLeaks via private messages on Twitter concerning damaging information on Hillary Clinton. Hope Hicks may have tried to hide emails concerning a mysterious meeting between Trump campaign officials and Russians tied to the Kremlin. On Thursday, the Department of Homeland Security told NBC News that the Russian government breached U.S. voting systems.\n\nThese stories are revealing but are few and far between. When we aren\u2019t hearing groundbreaking news on the Russian investigation, which is not common, we\u2019re inundated with talking heads discussing how shady Trump and his cronies are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYawn. We know already.\n\nMy problem with the news cycle is that it is ignoring white America\u2019s complicity in the Kremlin\u2019s meddling in the first place. If Russian bots can undo in one election cycle what it took centuries to build, does America have a democracy at all? And if we are to believe that disinformation campaigns turned the outcome for Trump (there is no evidence of that), why didn\u2019t most voters of color cast ballots for him?\n\nA lack of a self-reflective discourse in mainstream media\u2019s coverage essentially scapegoats Russia for the debacle that is Donald Trump\u2019s presidency. It\u2019s one thing to cover the Russia investigation. It\u2019s another to ignore or downplay why white people voted for a man who refused to criticize Russian President Vladimir Putin, even when America\u2019s top intelligence agencies confirmed Putin\u2019s role in attempting to undermine the U.S. political process.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRussia coverage devoid of this angle ignores the social chasms that compel white people to choose their race over allegiance to their country. I\u2019m sorry, but it\u2019s challenging for me to watch and read news of Russia\u2019s threat to democracy when America is doing a great job of destroying it all by itself.\n\n\n\nMy cynicism is rooted in the knowledge of America\u2019s barbaric resolve to strip black people of their rights to fully experience the democracy that, coincidentally, did not come under attack until Russia unleashed a legion of Twitter trolls.\n\n\n\nAmerica doesn\u2019t afford me the luxury of binary analysis. I can\u2019t just look at the Kremlin\u2019s threats against America without recognizing the internal threats that Moscow actively attempted to exploit\u2014threats that have a personal impact on my life as a black person. I don\u2019t enjoy the full spectrum of citizenship; nor does the rest of black America.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019ve endured more than 200 years of slavery, decades of Jim Crow, mob violence and voter suppression. These horrendous periods still haunt America. The Supreme Court invalidated a key part of the Voter Rights Act in 2013. GOP-led state legislatures actively passed voter-ID laws that make voting harder. America\u2019s police state kills black people at disproportionate rates, and governments at the federal and state levels are actively undermining health care access.\n\n\n\nI can\u2019t flow with the \u201cRussia is attacking our democracy\u201d angle because America is doing a better job of it. Of course, we can admit that Russian meddling isn\u2019t good, but I\u2019d be more inclined to engage media that explores Americans\u2019 complicity in it. I know what\u2019s wrong with this country, and it isn\u2019t Russia. It\u2019s racist white Trump supporters. If they had followed the conscience of people of color (especially black women), American democracy wouldn\u2019t be under the threat it\u2019s currently in.\n\nTo see countless white men (former ambassadors, think tank types, legislators and the running chorus of talking heads) appear on network television extolling the virtues of America\u2019s so-called democracy that Russia wants to undermine annoys me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs journalists, it is our job to report the facts. That racism both fueled Trump\u2019s victory and has consequently made us more susceptible to foreign attack only makes the stakes of the Russia investigation even higher. But major networks and print outlets will not lead with stories exploring white America\u2019s obsession with racism. That would upset too many advertisers\u2014and white viewers. But it would be the beginning of the type of intersectional Russia coverage that could help an audience better understand Russia and America\u2019s imperial aims and how election meddling plays a role in it.\n\nAs soon as Trump is arrested or forced to resign, I fear interest in Russia will fade, and that would be a pity. There has rarely been a better time than now to learn about the complexities of Russian imperialism and the lessons it can teach us about America\u2019s shortcomings at home and abroad.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth nations actively vie for world supremacy through a range of tactics, including political interference in some cases and through military force in others. Our media can play a vital role of explaining U.S.-Russia relations within this context. Such deep dives require media outlets and the white men who run them to understand how white supremacy and empire work.\n\n\n\nAnother problem with our media\u2019s fixation on Russia-gate is that other important news stories are getting little to no attention. Trump is belligerently calling for a nuclear arms race. As late as the mid-1980s, there were some 75,000 nuclear weapons in the world, mostly between Russia and the United States. Calm-headed diplomacy between Moscow and Washington, D.C., over the decades cut that figure down to around 15,000.\n\nThe new Nuclear Posture Review clearly shows that America isn\u2019t interested in cutting anymore nukes; nor is Trump interested in using his alleged good relationship with Putin to convince the Russian leader to reverse his own lust for nukes. All eyes are on North Korea\u2019s nuclear program, but Trump\u2019s love for nuclear weapons may very well convince Russia that there is no need to scale back its arsenal, making the world a less safe place.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd while politics between Russia and America on Earth are frayed, their relationship in space is strong. Roscosmos, Russia\u2019s space agency, and NASA announced the Deep Space Getaway program last year, part of a larger project to send humans to the moon. It is one of the few areas in which both nations must get along. Exploring why Moscow and Washington are cooperating in space would reveal that the two nations aren\u2019t always at odds and that they do need each other.\n\nAnd as much as the media love to cover Putin as an authoritarian the Russian people foolishly support, it is important to consider that most of white America supported Trump, who seemingly envies his Russian counterpart\u2019s anti-democratic ways. Indeed, Putin and Trump supporters may have a lot in common.\n\nSimply viewing Russia as an attacker of American values without investigating how Americans are destroying them in far worse ways isn\u2019t good Russia reporting. It simply blames Russia for Trump. That is insulting to the Russian people and Americans who know better.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUntil mainstream newsrooms make proper paradigm shifts in how they report the complexities of why Russia is doing what it is doing and why Americans are susceptible to it, we\u2019ll continue to suffer through one-sided reporting that indirectly weakens the democracy that American media strive to defend.\n\n", "keywords": ["russia", "democracy", "america", "white", "moscow", "trump", "russian", "americas", "boring", "media", "nuclear"], "polarity": 0.06519909237300542, "subjectivity": 0.3877371018675368},

This poses a problem when senior-level staff with full clearance have to be careful about what information they share with those who have only interim clearance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs of November, more than 130 White House staffers were working without full security clearance.\n\nLast month we also learned that both Porter and White House speechwriter David Sorensen had histories of domestic abuse. This is something that, at least in the case of Porter, could have prevented him from gaining full, permanent clearance.\n\nThe president is presumably allowing people to work with interim clearance, and as of now, we don\u2019t know which of those staffers have since gained full clearance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMike Rogers, a former Republican representative who chaired the House Intelligence Committee, told CNN last month: \u201cThe security clearance process is critical to keeping America\u2019s secrets.

Not following the process is a disservice not only to the individual but to our countries security interests.

There are things in his past that would render him ineligible for full security clearance. And yet, there he sits in the Oval Office\u2014with access to our military secrets and the power to launch us into nuclear war.\n\nAs we wait for special counsel Robert Mueller to figure out whether or not Trump obstructed justice and whether or not he was a pawn for the Russians, we need to be worried about who else the president has been running his mouth to.

His tough stance against the Soviet Union\u2019s expansionism and his efforts to support anti-Soviet movements in former communist-bloc states helped lead to the USSR\u2019s fall in 1991. His \u201cTear down this wall\u201d speech at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin on June 12, 1987, is remembered for its symbolism and defiance as well as Reagan\u2019s robust behind-the-scenes diplomacy. (Of course, Reagan\u2019s other policies in general were horrible, but that is another story.)\n\nRepublicans today herald Reagan as the guardian who stood up against Soviet aggression and a symbol of the Republican Party\u2019s hawkish foreign policy against Moscow. But it is obvious that the reputation Reagan cultivated for his party is under threat by Donald Trump, a Republican president who many believe is in cahoots with the Kremlin. Not only is there a special investigation into whether Trump\u2019s campaign colluded with Russia to win the 2016 presidential election, but Trump\u2019s attempts to cozy up to Vladimir Putin are doing little to ease those concerns.\n\nBefore and during his campaign for president, Trump lamented that former President Barack Obama was weak on Russia\u2019s aggression in Ukraine and Syria. During a videoconference call to a high-profile annual conference in Kiev, Ukraine, in September of 2015, Trump said, \u201cOur president is not strong\u2014so far all we have is lip service,\u201d adding, \u201cPart of the problem that Ukraine has with the United States is that Putin does not respect our president whatsoever.\u201d In 2016, Trump tweeted about Obama\u2019s lack of strength against Russia over Ukraine.\n\nInterestingly, though, Trump has essentially failed to stand up to Russia\u2019s meddling in European elections or, for that matter, our own elections. Trump\u2019s lack of enthusiasm for blasting the Kremlin is obvious\u2014I mean, Putin helped him win the White House\u2014but that should not stop Republicans from attacking Trump with the same zeal as they did Obama\u2014if, of course, they really are Russia hawks.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), one of Obama\u2019s sharpest critics, wrote in the National Review that Obama needed to reverse his \u201cpolicy of weakness\u201d against Russia over Syria. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said in April 2014 that Obama\u2019s refusal to grant Ukraine critical defensive weapons was \u201canother sign of weakness\u201d in Putin\u2019s eyes. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told CNN that Obama was \u201cweak and indecisive.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFast-forward several years later, and we have Trump, who has yet to grant Ukraine defensive weapons, failing to punish Russia for arguably the greatest attack against U.S. democracy in American history or criticize Putin for what many human rights organizations say is Russia\u2019s bombing of civilian targets in Syria.\n\nThe lack of criticism from the Republican Party for Trump\u2019s handling of Russian aggression is just as apparent. There was plenty of room to criticize Obama for his response to Putin\u2019s geopolitical chess match in Europe and elsewhere, but Trump? Not so much.\n\nSure, he is the GOP\u2019s president, but does party loyalty rank higher than allowing Trump to stand down against Putin\u2019s geopolitical aggression, which has only intensified over the past year? That appears to be the case. Has McCain, Rubio or Graham called Trump weak even once? I Googled and actually found Russian officials calling Trump \u201cweak.\u201d Ironic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nObama\u2019s stance against Russia may have been slow, and his understanding of Moscow\u2019s motives may have left much to be desired, but in light of the Trump campaign\u2019s possible collusion with the Kremlin, Obama, comparatively speaking, looks like the real hawk.\n\nObama\u2019s economic sanctions helped force Russia\u2019s economy to contract by 3.7 percent in 2015. In addition, key drilling projects were forced to shut down as a result. Naturally, Ukraine and U.S. Russia hawks wanted more, but the devastating impact of the Obama administration\u2019s action was hardly weak.\n\nOn the other hand, the Republican response to the Russian collusion scandal has been very weak. When then-acting U.S. Attorney General Sally Yates and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper testified in May that ex-national security adviser Mike Flynn may have been compromised by Russia, GOP senators were more concerned about who leaked the story to the media than gathering information about Flynn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRepublicans also pushed back against former FBI Director James Comey during his June testimony when he said Trump fired him because of his handling of the Russia investigation. House Speaker Paul Ryan brushed off Comey\u2019s claims by saying Trump was \u201cjust new to this\u201d and didn\u2019t understand protocol.\n\nI doubt Obama would have been afforded the same pass, especially since McCain once said during a 2008 debate that the presidency doesn\u2019t allow time for \u201con-the-job training.\u201d\n\nToday\u2019s Republicans are showing their true colors. They do not care about defending America against Moscow. During the presidential campaign, the GOP cared about votes, something that was obvious from Trump\u2019s base, which clearly didn\u2019t care about Russian meddling as long as it helped Hillary Clinton lose.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne Trump supporter told the New York Times, \u201cIf that\u2019s what it took, I\u2019m glad they did it.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, American democracy is being taken to the sunken place by a Congress and a White House full of doves.", "keywords": ["trumps", "russia", "making", "president", "weak", "fake", "hawks", "trump", "look", "gop", "ukraine", "russian", "republican", "obama", "russias"], "polarity": 0.020474241594931254, "subjectivity": 0.44415667346701815},

Should Americans truly be perplexed by Trump\u2019s praise of Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte, who has used his national police force to target drug dealers and users in a campaign that has left an estimated 13,000 people dead?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot really.\n\nBefore winning the presidency, Trump never had to answer to anyone except for his father, whom he worked for before taking over the family business after his death. Being the singular decision-maker in a high-profile real estate company for more than 30 years certainly leaves little patience for concessions to and caucusing with colleagues who are required to be treated as equals.\n\nTrump\u2019s recent complaint that he wishes he could have more influence on the Justice Department further reveals his disdain for the limitations of power. Consequently, his love of strongmen around the world who can rule with abandon makes sense. While he has complimented many strongmen around the world, three stand out the most.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRodrigo Duterte, President of the Philippines\n\nWhy Trump admires him: Supports police brutality, uses crude language, has no filter.\n\nAnalysis: Like Trump, Duterte encourages police brutality, but the Philippines leader takes it to an extreme. Trump has gone on record telling police officers to rough up people taken into custody and has considered sending the feds to Chicago, which essentially would make them an occupying force that does nothing to reduce crime. Back in the mid-1980s, he ran ads in major New York City papers calling for five black men to be executed after they were wrongly arrested for raping a white woman in Central Park. Of course, racism was a driving force behind all of this, but it also fuels his desire to use over-the-top government policing.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother quality Trump shares with Duterte is his lack of a filter. Duterte once compared himself to Hitler. He later apologized. In October of last year, Duterte told then-President Barack Obama to \u201cgo to hell,\u201d just as the United States and the Philippines began joint military exercises. The following month, Duterte called Obama a \u201cson of a whore.\u201d Of course, since Russia and China are closer geographically, it would make sense for the Philippines to forge strong ties with them, but the United States and the Philippines share a defense treaty that states they would protect each other if attacked by an external force.\n\nIt\u2019s probably not a smart idea to piss off the world\u2019s most powerful military that could protect you when the time calls for it. But Duterte isn\u2019t one to think through things. Neither is his buddy Trump.\n\nBut Trump apparently likes Duterte\u2019s ability to do and say as he pleases. Duterte is not a dictator per se, and he enjoys widespread support, despite his abuse of police power. Trump probably wishes he could abuse his powers and have widespread support, too, but U.S. rule of law would not allow it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGuess Trump has to admire those who can.\n\nVladimir Putin, President of Russia\n\nWhy Trump admires him: Authoritarian, leads a kleptocracy, answers to no one.\n\nAnalysis: The obvious reason for this is probably the fact that the U.S. intelligence community believes that the Kremlin worked to get Trump elected. Not to mention Russia\u2019s alleged ties to WikiLeaks, which, according to a recent report in The Atlantic, was in contact with Donald Trump Jr. But there are personality reasons why Trump would find Vladimir Putin to be an aspirational leader.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor one, Russia is a kleptocracy. That\u2019s a fancy political science term that means those in power use the state primarily to steal resources from the state. Or, more directly, rule by thieves. Putin\u2019s estimated net worth is in the billions of dollars. PBS\u2019s Frontline aired a documentary in which Putin is accused of using his political position in the early 1990s to steal land from the Russian state and sell it for personal gain.\n\nTrump\u2019s White House very much functions as a kleptocracy. He has openly acknowledged that his resorts and golf courses have generated tens of millions of dollars since he took office in January. His properties Mar-a-Lago, in Florida, and Bedminster, in New Jersey, have gotten free advertising during his estimated 58 visits so far as president. His son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is a senior adviser who takes on major foreign policy roles, even though he has no foreign policy experience. In her role as White House counselor, Kellyanne Conway once promoted Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump\u2019s clothing on live television in what some considered a violation of federal ethics rules. Ivanka also received lucrative Chinese patents the same day she dined with Chinese President Xi Jinping at Mar-a-Lago. The list goes on and on.\n\nAnother reason Trump may find Putin appealing is his suppression of freedom of expression. Artists, film directors and journalists have all felt the strain (and, in some cases, been killed) under Putin\u2019s restrictive regime. Trump cannot control media here and has long referred to the press as \u201cfake news\u201d because of its fair reporting of his administration. In October he even threatened to challenge media organizations\u2019 licenses. He really can\u2019t do that, but Trump\u2019s desire to do so is the stuff of authoritarian states.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump wants to be a strongman, but because the United States is a functioning democracy, he can\u2019t. But that doesn\u2019t stop him from adoring men like Putin who can be.\n\nKim Jong Un, Leader of North Korea\n\nWhy Trump admires him: Unpredictable, runs a totalitarian state.\n\nAnalysis: Given that Kim Jong Un has consistently vowed to wipe the United States off the map, it really doesn\u2019t make sense for Trump to find the North Korean leader likable. But this is Trump, and nothing makes sense in his world. Back in May, he complimented Kim for, apparently, taking out his adversaries to assume power of Pyongyang.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cA lot of people, I\u2019m sure, tried to take that power away, whether it was his uncle or anybody else,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd he was able to do it. So obviously, he\u2019s a pretty smart cookie.\u201d\n\nDuring a campaign rally last early year, Trump made similar remarks, according to ABC News:\n\n\u201cHow many young guys\u2014he was like 26 or 25 when his father died\u2014take over these tough generals, and all of a sudden ... he goes in, he takes over, and he\u2019s the boss,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible. He wiped out the uncle, he wiped out this one, that one. I mean this guy doesn\u2019t play games. And we can\u2019t play games with him.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, Trump has called Kim \u201cRocket Man\u201d and the North Korean leader has returned the insults. But Trump\u2019s complimentary remarks toward Kim do reflect the president\u2019s perverted understanding of strength. North Korea is a totalitarian state, meaning that the people are completely submissive to the rule of the dictator and the state. This is actually worse than either Putin\u2019s Russia or Duterte\u2019s Philippines because at least people in those nations can protest, albeit with limitations, in the case of Russia.\n\nBut perhaps Kim\u2019s appeal to Trump has to do with the North Korean people\u2019s worship of their leader. Official events in the country often show people expressing such adulation for Kim and its past leaders that they are left in tears. While many analysts argue that these celebrations are forced, one could say that Trump\u2019s own healthy ego yearns for such attention\u2014even if it is not sincere.\n\nHere in the United States, Trump gets nothing like the public support that Kim, Putin and Duterte receive in their own nations. None of those nations, though, are model democracies, and all lack certain degrees of the rule of law. What is troubling is Trump\u2019s desire to erode the rule of law in his own country. Whether it\u2019s his frustration over not being able to unleash the Justice Department on Hillary Clinton or how the media operates, Trump has no real appreciation for democracy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt makes sense, though. He doesn\u2019t truly believe in it anyway. And neither do his buddies in Russia, North Korea and the Philippines.\n\n", "keywords": ["trumps", "kim", "love", "duterte", "states", "putin", "president", "donald", "trump", "guide", "north", "strongmen", "philippines", "rule"], "polarity": 0.08955911372578039, "subjectivity": 0.4314021472354806},

It\u2019s pretty basic: If you\u2019re willing to throw your people under the bus in order to promote your selfish ambitions and cuddle up with the (white) man, you\u2019re a sellout.\n\nWhile I have strived to divorce myself from using such language for the sake of productive dialogue, I cannot help exploring the cases of Donald Trump and former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, both of whom sold out their respective countries for closer proximity to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe main link between these two sellouts: Paul Manafort.\n\nIt makes sense that Manafort, who spent 10 years in Ukraine advising Yanukovych and his pro-Russian Party of Regions, would eventually take the helm of Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. To be sure, Yanukovych is very much like Trump. His only interests in Ukraine were to get rich and maintain power, according to John Herbst, former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine from 2004 to 2006. Likewise, Trump cares little about policy and more about ratcheting up racial anxiety among his base to maintain his hold on the Oval Office\u2014not to mention he\u2019s also using it as a cash cow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYanukovych, who was convicted of robbery and assault as a younger man, was widely considered a corrupt politician as an adult, and his Party of Regions has long been believed to have Mafia ties. Manafort cleaned up Yanukovych\u2019s image, teaching him how to deliver a speech even though the American spoke no Russian or Ukrainian. Manafort instructed him on how to expand his base beyond the Russian-speaking minorities who backed him in the eastern part of the country. In 2004, Yanukovych ran for president and won, but the election was rife with voter fraud, leading to mass protests and, eventually, a do-over that was won by his pro-Western opponent, Viktor Yushchenko.\n\nThough Yanukovych lost, Manafort earned a role as a top adviser to the Party of Regions and would plot for the next election in 2010, which Yanukovych would eventually win in a very close race. One of the first controversial moves Yanukovych made was to extend the lease of Russia\u2019s Black Sea Fleet, set to expire in 2017, to at least 2042. For many Ukrainians who feared Russia\u2019s territorial ambitions for Ukraine, Yanukovych\u2019s move was a clear sign that Kiev would be under Moscow\u2019s thumb for decades to come.\n\nDuring his time in office, Yanukovych would eventually run the country into the ground and steal billions of dollars from its coffers, according to Ukrainian officials. Manafort was allegedly paid more than $28 million for his work over the period he was in Ukraine. For his part, Manafort insists that he wanted to coach the Party of Regions and Yanukovych to become more Westernized and less corrupt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe final straw for Ukrainians tired of Yanukovych came in 2013, when he reneged on signing the European Union Association Agreement that many Ukrainians supported at the time and felt would pull the country closer to better economic opportunities in the West. Putin was against the deal and threatened Yanukovych politically if he went through with it.\n\nYanukovych caved, and again, in less than 10 years, people stormed the streets, this time calling for Yanukovych\u2019s resignation. He responded by allegedly ordering the nation\u2019s security services to fire into crowds of protesters, killing dozens of them. Snipers were even used to terrorize protesters, Ukrainian officials allege. And, to add insult to injury, Yanukovych called on Russia to use force to put down his own people\u2019s protests because he lacked the leadership to look them in the eye after falling out of their favor.\n\nIf calling on another nation\u2019s military to suppress protests in your own country isn\u2019t a sellout move, I really do not know what is. Yanukovych eventually fled and is in hiding in Russia under the care of Putin, who would eventually annex Crimea, a region in east Ukraine, and back rebels in eastern Ukraine who are waging war against Kiev. Yep, Yanukovych is chillin\u2019 in Russia with folks who do not really want Ukraine to be its own nation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis, folks, was the man Manafort backed for 10 years. A pure sellout to his people and his country.\n\nSo when Manafort left Ukraine in 2014, it would make sense for him to eventually see an opportunity in backing Trump, a man who is as much a sellout as Yanukovych. We didn\u2019t know in the beginning of Trump\u2019s campaign, but his top aides were allegedly forming very suspect alliances with Russians who reportedly have ties to the Kremlin. Carter Page, Mike Flynn, Manafort himself and others would eventually have to leave the Trump campaign because of those suspicious ties.\n\nTrump, curiously, has yet to say anything negative about Putin despite criticizing former President Barack Obama for allowing Russia to invade Ukraine. Trump said nothing as it became clear that Putin was meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, which U.S. intelligence officials believe was done to support Trump. To this day, he has yet to condemn Russia for its actions. To the contrary, he has created a voter-fraud commission that will likely lead to voter suppression of black and brown Americans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you remember, Trump encouraged Russia to hack Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails, a pure sellout thing to do. Manafort would not stay on to lead Trump to his November victory, but Manafort\u2019s efforts to put a Kremlin puppet in the White House reveal how willing he is to help world leaders sell out their countries for access to Russia.\n\nSpecial prosecutor Robert Mueller is in the thick of his investigation, so we are still learning the details of Manafort\u2019s ties to Russia and any possible ties to the Trump campaign. But one thing is very clear: Manafort is tied to two world leaders who sold out their countries at the expense of risking their sovereignty to an expansionist Kremlin.\n\nThe thing about sellouts is that they are ostracized and shunned by their people. Or at least they should be. Ukrainians did the right thing and revolted against Yanukovych, sending him to Russia, where he belongs. Americans should get Trump and his ilk one-way tickets to Moscow as well. But unlike Ukrainians, many white folks here actually support Trump being a sellout to Putin. So that leaves us to depend on Mueller, who is expected to force Trump\u2019s inner circle to account for what appears to be collusion with Moscow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nManafort was charged with 12 counts on Monday, including conspiracy against the United States, but there was one missing: being the adviser of sellouts.", "keywords": ["russia", "putin", "sellouts", "adviser", "sellout", "trump", "ukraine", "ukrainians", "manafort", "eventually", "yanukovych", "paul", "ukrainian"], "polarity": 0.04486935972891029, "subjectivity": 0.4223961120028535},

He also pleaded guilty. Then there is Richard Pinedo, a California man who used stolen identities to sell bank accounts to Russians meddling in the election. Pinedo pleaded guilty, too. And let\u2019s not forget the 13 Russian nationals and three Russian companies that were indicted in February for allegedly interfering in the 2016 election. That\u2019s a ton of people to be charged, most of whom have already pleaded guilty, if there is no there there.\n\nBut why this tweet today, you ask? And why the obnoxious all caps?

I want you all to think clearly about this: While the sharks of Russian collusion are closing in, the president of the United States of NASCAR lovers can\u2019t stop cozying up to the man whose country was involved in the hacking of America\u2019s presidential election.\n\nThat\u2019s right\u2014the president of the people who shop at Abercrombie & Fitch can\u2019t stop following the Russian president around the club like an obsessive dude who purchased Putin a drink and now believes that they go together.\n\nHe. Doesn\u2019t. Get. It.\n\nAll of the intelligence services in the actual United States believe that Russia hacked America\u2019s election, and this man wants to break bread with the man who leads Russia. He wants to talk cybersecurity with him. He wants Putin to think he\u2019s cute. He probably showed him all the cool moves he can do with a fidget spinner. He\u2019s so pathetic. And while all of America, including the press he adores, is baffled by his behavior, he won\u2019t stop.\n\nWhen The Root staff learned that Trump had, in fact, had a second undisclosed meeting with Putin, Deputy Editor Genetta Adams noted that there was one thing, and one thing only, that must be driving Trump\u2019s insistent need to swipe right for Russia: pee-pee tapes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd I think she\u2019s right. Initially I thought the rumors that Trump paid Russian prostitutes to urinate on the bed in which former President Barack Obama had reportedly slept was funny. Now I think it\u2019s true. Putin must have something over Trump that is fueling this obsessive attraction to the leader of a country we don\u2019t fuck with. Historically, the United States and Russia have rarely been friends, which this president doesn\u2019t seem to understand. In fact, Trump isn\u2019t even trying to hide his love for Putin, and at this point, he just needs to come out and say it.\n\nTrump admitting that he has a thing for Putin would probably be less groundbreaking than the slow trickle of reports that amount to learning that Trump has stolen Papa Bannon\u2019s car so that he could sit in front of Putin\u2019s house to talk with him about love and stuff. They are together, and at this point, who are we to stop them? I think it\u2019s time we accept that our president has a thing for the Russian leader and just work through our issues that we have around collusion.

This, despite 45 mentioning repeatedly over the span of years that he met Putin. And all week, many anchors, pundits and political reporters asked silly questions about how 45 will engage Putin. Will he bring up Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election? If not, is it a sign of his weakness as a leader? Would such a move further reduce America\u2019s standing in the world?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s been like watching a child-left-behind-themed reboot of Ghostwriter. These are not complicated questions, and there is no point pretending otherwise in the name of \u201cobjectivity,\u201d \u201cbalance\u201d or whatever other bullshit phrasing used to convey playing dumb. Why would Sweet Potato Saddam tell Putin before the entire world that the United States will not stand for Russian interference in our sovereignty when he\u2019s made it abundantly clear that he doesn\u2019t care? If anything, 45 hopes they will do it again because, if coupled with voter suppression, surely he can win re-election.\n\n\n\nTrue to form, when asked about it a day prior to meeting his Russian BFF, 45 talked in circles per his usual. You see, Russia probably interfered in the election, but we don\u2019t know for sure because something about the Iraq War; although if they did interfere, it\u2019s former President Barack Obama\u2019s fault for not stopping it because he thought Hillary Clinton was going to win the election. 45 treats Obama\u2019s sac like his personal swing, so it\u2019s only fitting that he once again found a way to fault Obama for Vladimir\u2019s actions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich is the real answer? The hell if 45 knows or, at the very least, has any will to say. I wonder what could be preventing such an admission. Let me turn on Dave Chappelle\u2019s \u201cPiss on You\u201d and ponder a bit more.\n\n\n\nWhatever the case, we know that 45 was never going to cop to Russian meddling on his behalf when he\u2019s still trying to convince the public that he would have won the popular vote if not for 3 million to 5 million illegal voters who exist only inside that forest fire of a brain he has. Why did anyone ever bother to pretend otherwise?\n\nSo now that everyone is caught up, yes, it means that 45 is a weak leader for what many have rightfully referred to as a \u201cdereliction of duty,\u201d and of course, the cowardly act makes America look even smaller on the world stage.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for their meeting, a live adaptation of Pinocchio, look at the glee in 45\u2019s eyes. He looks ready to climax. For those who were hoping for a public scolding: Bless y\u2019all\u2019s hearts. 45 looked ready to ask Putin, \u201cHow do you like your eggs, zaddy?\u201d in Russian.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 45-Putin meeting was scheduled to last only 30 minutes but went well over two hours. What did they talk about? Well, it\u2019s unlikely that 45 or Secretary of State Blanche Devereaux\u2019s Ex-Boyfriend will share any real details, even if it\u2019s easy to take notes while on one\u2019s knees. Putin probably played 45 for the narcissistic simpleton he is as the secretary of state tapped his feet waiting for Russian sanctions to be lifted so that Exxon can cash out. That said, the Russian state-run outlet Sputnik reports that Putin and 45 discussed Ukraine, Syria, the fight against terrorism and cybersecurity.\n\nSo the Ukraine is theirs, Syria will be handled however they see fit, the same goes for terrorism and \u201cWhat do you mean by \u2018cybersecurity,\u2019 comrade?\u201d\n\n\n\nPutin has helped installed a mindless reality star and longtime scammer as the head of state of his broke-bitch nation\u2019s greatest adversary, but while it is fair to make him the international bogeyman, the reality is, hordes of white folks voted for 45 for no other reason than that they wanted to feel good about being white. It\u2019s called \u201ccultural anxiety,\u201d but that\u2019s merely business-casual dressing for \u201cracism.\u201d These people wanted to feel so good about being white that they elected a fool with no real love of America and its principles. They continue to be excused although their votes have made it abundantly clear that they love this country far less than the very \u201cothers\u201d they believe are wrecking it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo many of us\u2014including the last U.S. president\u2014have been called unpatriotic for far fewer offenses (or none at all). Yet this bloated orange soda can of a man stood among the world\u2019s richest nations and cowered to Russia\u2019s despot, and he still won\u2019t be called out as the traitor that he is. I suppose I could ask why, but that would be as silly a question as wondering all week how 45 would act when he\u2019s made his plans all too clear.\n\n\n\n", "keywords": ["week", "putin", "president", "hes", "political", "expected", "white", "russian", "yalls", "meeting", "state", "met", "benefactor", "behaved", "real", "45"], "polarity": 0.09964204545454547, "subjectivity": 0.43950347222222225},

According to the preliminary findings, the new American president is \u201ca risk-taker who can be naive,\u201d according to \u201ca senior Kremlin adviser.\u201d Other revelations include that 45 \u201cdoesn\u2019t understand fully who is Mr. Putin\u2014he is a tough guy.\u201d\n\nNo. 45 doesn\u2019t know a lot of things, including the basic functions of the U.S. government; the Constitution; how anyone not white, male, well-off and boosted by nepotism lives; and anything that requires the intellect of someone above a fourth-grade reading level. Oh, and apparently \u201cmany in the Kremlin believed that Trump viewed the presidency as a business.\u201d\n\nI wonder whether this dossier\u2014compiled by retired diplomats and Putin staff members\u2014also tells us the color of the sky.\n\n\n\nIts intent, it is said, is to properly prep Putin for his first meeting with 45. However, considering the growing evidence that 45 is the mutt he helped housebreak into the White House, you would think he would already be quite familiar with a man who literally is inescapable within media. What else is there to learn about an erratic narcissist who\u2019s never shown allegiance to anything besides himself and maybe his daughter?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m not in the habit of assisting comrades, but since I\u2019ve always wanted to play redbone Frasier Crane for a spell, I\u2019d like to help out.\n\n\n\nFor starters, 45 is a dumb-ass man who believes anything that sounds totally implausible but nonetheless complimentary to his dim-witted view of the world. To wit, \u201cthe failing New York Times\u201d recently profiled 45\u2019s favorite little conspiracy theorist, Alex Jones. For those among \u201cthe blacks\u201d who are unfamiliar, let me paint a picture: Take the overweight lover Heavy D, remove his melanin and paint his mug with idiocy and lunacy, then marry him off to one of those grocery store tabloids that swear Kourtney Kardashian is having Xenu\u2019s baby. That is Jones, and much like Jones, 45 enjoys being loud, wrong and crazy.\n\n\n\nWe live in a free country until the Colby-Jack F\u00fchrer declares otherwise, but Vladimir, you can\u2019t trust anyone that stupid to do anything for you, no matter how much piss-stained footage you may or may not have on him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen there is Politico\u2019s \u201cHow Trump\u2019s Campaign Staffers Tried to Keep Him Off Twitter,\u201d which deep-dives into how those poor, unfortunate, soulless individuals often tried in vain to keep their then-candidate from live-tweeting the presidential election to often disastrous results.\n\n\n\nFormer Communications Director Sam Nunberg explained:\n\n\n\nIf candidate Trump was upset about unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he was getting fair coverage from outlets that were persuadable. The same media that our base digests and prefers is going to be the base for his support. I would assume the president would like to see positive and preferential treatment from those outlets and that would help the operation overall.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, Put-Put (if I can call you that, Vlad), if you want to stay on 45\u2019s good side, always retweet him. Hell, favorite his tweets, too. Make him feel special. That should help. Well, temporarily, anyway. He\u2019s going to turn on you anyway. Ask Ivana Trump. Or Marla Maples. Or Melania Trump when her pussy-grabbing husband isn\u2019t hovering over her. Or any contractors still waiting to be paid for their services.\n\n\n\nThen again, no matter what the Kremlin may have on the man, or however much its often shirtless authoritarian compliments him, he is an dishonest, disloyal, messy bitch from Queens, N.Y. I don\u2019t believe in the adage \u201cTrust no bitch,\u201d but Put-Put, don\u2019t trust that bitch. Not to get anything done, anyway\u2014particularly when his approval ratings are lower than the Grammy Awards are with black women, gay black men and people with taste.\n\nIt seems that part of this dossier is rooted in just such growing concern. NBC reports:\n\nPutin\u2019s government is growing increasingly concerned about Trump\u2019s battles in Washington, according to Fedorov and former lawmaker Sergei Markov, who remains well-connected at the Kremlin. It is worried the president will not have the political power to improve relations with Russia, as he has indicated he might try to do, and even, perhaps, lift some U.S. sanctions.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPut-Put is beginning to worry that Honeysuckle Lenin won\u2019t be able to do much in the way of boosting Russia\u2019s raggedy ass on the global stage. That explains why the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is accusing various mainstream media outlets of spreading fake news about Muva Russia.\n\nVia CNN:\n\nForeign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the project was aimed at countering an \u201cinformation campaign aimed against Russia\u201d by exposing false statements from leading foreign media outlets and officials. Speaking to journalists on Wednesday, Zakharova said stories about Moscow\u2019s attempts to hack foreign elections and Russian submarines operating in northern Europe were examples of such fake news.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn other words, Russia\u2019s little intel operation seeking to influence elections in Western elections is starting to backfire. To quote the goddess Rihanna, \u201c#PoorDat.\u201d As a black man, I\u2019m not exactly strolling the streets shouting, \u201cUSA! USA! USA!\u201d Even so, I find it amusing that a hostile foreign government that helped elect an orange, unqualified simpleton as U.S. president is suddenly finding itself a wee bit shaken.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m sure that Sunkist Stalin and Vladimir Putin will continue their public flirtation for the foreseeable future. Still, ultimately, 45 will fail Putin the way he tends to fail most people. Those two deserve each other ... and a big, hot pool of urine to fall into.\n\n\n\nNow, how do you say, \u201cDon\u2019t kill me\u201d in Russian?\n\n", "keywords": ["weave", "foreign", "putin", "president", "outlets", "political", "stalin", "wants", "sunkist", "kremlin", "quick", "trump", "russian", "wig", "man", "media", "45", "realizing"], "polarity": -0.016559758711384993, "subjectivity": 0.4467503018523426},

Bannon was asked specific questions that had been negotiated between the White House and the House\u2019s lead counsel.\n\nBannon had been subpoenaed by the committee on Jan. 16 but managed to postpone the subpoena deadline three times as the White House and House lawyers negotiated which questions he could answer without the White House invoking executive privilege to prevent him from testifying.\n\nDemocrat Rep. Adam Schiff of California, ranking member of the committee, told reporters: \u201cThe only questions he would answer were questions that had been scripted, literally scripted for him by the White House. Whenever we sought to probe anything beyond the four corners of the specific wording of the question, he refused to answer. That\u2019s not how executive privilege works.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, lawmakers said that continued noncooperation on Bannon\u2019s part could result in the committee taking steps to hold him in contempt of Congress.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe claims of executive privilege will be looked into by committee member Rep. Mike Conaway (R-Texas), who said that he will work with House Speaker Paul Ryan and House lawyers to determine whether contempt proceedings would be appropriate.\n\nSo the White House was able to script what Bannon told the House Intelligence Committee, but it wasn\u2019t able to do that for Bannon\u2019s meetings with Mueller.\n\nWhich leaves us to wonder what Bannon may have told Mueller. Did he roll over on his former friend and boss? The way he slobbered on the mic for Michael Wolff for the freeski would lead one to believe that under fear of some type of legal recourse against him, he may have done the same with Mueller.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOh, to be a fly on the wall for that.\n\nI need Mueller to drop the bomb already. We\u2019ve been waiting long enough.

Along with showcasing natural hair, designer Nicholas Ghesqui\u00e8re returned to the house of Louis Vuitton this season after a long absence from the runways and showed his own variation of the primary colors in patchwork patterns that appeared in designer collections on almost every Fall/Winter 2018-2019 catwalk. Ghesqui\u00e8re\u2019s interpretation showed up on corset belts that are a sexy and simple-to-wear update for a fall wardrobe.\n\nBlack against primary or neon colors is also a directional color theme for fall. Vuitton illustrated a prevailing mood in fashion that sexy has its place, but only if it also somehow says power. For instance, notice a flounce of details on one side of the shirt tucked into a high-waisted belt, so as not to be over-the-top (no pun intended) sexy. And elements of menswear like tweed were feminized with beaded trims and ruffles, creating a capelet effect as a pretty version of padded power shoulders.\n\nOpera-length gloves for both day and night were another fixture in the accessories category this season. Whether in satin, leather or neoprene, they quickly elevate an outfit to fashionista status with the snap of the wrist.\n\nMeanwhile, athleisure is fading away from the fashion footrace, with sneakers being outpaced by chunky-but-elegant heels. Take note, fashion lovers: Bold straps also pick up the patchwork theme on shoes and boots. At Vuitton, other microtrends that added up to a big new look for fall were stripes, lariats and shoulder-duster earrings with statement pearls on delicate chains.\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images 1 / 10\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can check out the full Louis Vuitton presentation below and let The Glow Up know which looks you love.

It has from the beginning, and two of the major offenses have been the administration\u2019s obvious ties to Cousin Putin and lying. The entire campaign and presidency up to this point have had to answer questions about both, so it seems a little disingenuous that national security adviser Michael Flynn would resign from his post for lying about Russia.\n\n\n\nOn Monday, reports began swirling that Flynn lied to officials about his communications with the Russian ambassador to the United States. It was also noted that Flynn may have been in danger of being blackmailed by the Russians, CNN reports.\n\n\u201cI inadvertently briefed the vice president-elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian ambassador. I have sincerely apologized to the president and the vice president, and they have accepted my apology,\u201d Flynn wrote in his resignation letter, obtained by CNN.\n\n\n\nBut here is the thing: Everyone in this administration, including President Pee-Pee, is vulnerable to being blackmailed by the Russians because this isn\u2019t even real life anymore; it\u2019s a bad episode of House of Cards, and the actors in this drama are a lot less appealing.\n\nSo it\u2019s all coming out in the wash as Flynn takes one for the team. Did he talk with Russia about lifting sanctions imposed by then-President Barack Obama (pour a little out) for Russia\u2019s involvement in the presidential election? Fuck yeah, he did, and the White House needs to stop acting as if it didn\u2019t know.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough no one knows the long-term play with this newfound love affair between President Pee-Pee and Putin, it\u2019s clear that those two need to get a room. When the White House learned of possible deception going on right underneath its nose, it had Sean \u201cSpicy Facts\u201d Spicer issue a pearl-clutching statement.\n\n\u201cThe president is evaluating the situation,\u201d Spicer\u2019s statement said. \u201cHe\u2019s speaking to the vice president relative to the conversation the vice president had with Gen. Flynn, and also speaking to various other people about what he considers the single most important subject there is: our national security.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe White House doesn\u2019t care about anybody outside of the White House.

When it was revealed that both the FBI and White House officials knew about the allegations against both men, it raised questions as to why they were allowed to keep their jobs and whether or not this administration enables abusers.\n\nIn a White House press briefing Monday afternoon, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders asserted that the White House takes the allegations \u201cvery seriously\u201d and believes that they should be \u201cinvestigated thoroughly.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe president and the entire administration take domestic violence very seriously and believe all allegations need to be investigated thoroughly. Above all, the president supports victims of domestic violence and believes everyone should be treated fairly and with due process. We\u2019ve addressed this situation extensively, and we have nothing more to add at this time on that topic,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nWhen asked why we haven\u2019t heard the president himself say that he supports victims, Sanders said, \u201cI spoke with the president. Those are actually directly his words that he gave me.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen pressed on the issue as to why Donald Trump hasn\u2019t said that when he\u2019s had the opportunity to do so, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s my job to speak on behalf of the president. I spoke to him, and he relayed that message directly to me, and I\u2019m relaying it directly to you.\u201d\n\nOh, really?\n\nI seem to recall last summer, when asked why the president was allowed to tweet things about special counsel Robert Mueller, Sanders specifically said that it was not her job to speak for the president.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, is it \u201cOochie Wally\u201d or is it \u201cOne Mic,\u201d Suckabee?\n\nFurthermore, it\u2019s interesting that this is the spin we are being given considering that the president has tweeted on his own about the situation, and what he said is the complete antithesis of what Sanders is saying to the American people now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Saturday, the president wrote on Twitter: \u201cPeoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation. Some are true and some are false. Some are old and some are new. There is no recovery for someone falsely accused\u2014life and career are gone. Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process?\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t sound like a man who supports victims of domestic violence. That sounds like a man who wants to gaslight victims in favor of the men accused.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen asked about the Rob Porter situation Friday, Trump defended Porter publicly and said, \u201cHe says he innocent, and I think you have to remember that.\u201d\n\nThat is the same defense he lobbed for then-Senate candidate Roy Moore back in December when allegations of inappropriate sexual contact with minors emerged about Moore.\n\nAt the time, Trump said, \u201cWell, he denies it. He says it didn\u2019t happen. And you have to listen to him also.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFurthermore, the president himself has been accused 19 times of sexual harassment and sexual abuse\u2014claims that he and the White House have labeled \u201cfake news.\u201d His administration\u2019s policies do not show any amount of care for women who are victims, either. In fact, before he even took office, his team proposed eliminating the Justice Department\u2019s violence-against-women grant programs that allocate funds to organizations that deal with sexual assault and domestic abuse.\n\nAs a woman, I\u2019m not sure how Suckabee reconciles her staunch defense of the president and his bullshit in the wake of the #MeToo movement. That she could stand at that podium and give that bullshit-ass statement is sickening. She knows what her boss has said publicly (more than once!) when it comes to accused abusers, and she continues to defend him anyway. It\u2019s gross.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s obvious the president doesn\u2019t care about victims of domestic violence. He\u2019s made that clear.\n\nThe somewhat shocking reveal here is that maybe Suckabee doesn\u2019t care, either.\n\nAnd that\u2019s sad.", "keywords": ["domestic", "president", "house", "victims", "white", "trump", "huckabee", "supports", "allegations", "sanders", "sexual", "sarah", "violence", "statements", "tweets", "say"], "polarity": 0.035624403844742844, "subjectivity": 0.4193398879839558},

You read it correctly. Although there is some speculation that it might have been a mistake or a glitch in the matrix, a guest on a Fake News\u2014I mean, Fox News\u2014show uttered a nonfiction statement that was based in reality.\n\nDuring a one-on-one interview, the conservative icon and spokesman for white America Bill O\u2019Reilly engaged Trump on the Great Pumpkin president\u2019s schoolboy crush on Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. When O\u2019Reilly pressed the comb-over-in-chief about Putin\u2019s propensity for violence and history of killing Russian citizens, Trump responded, \u201cThere are a lot of killers.

Of course, you have to put the leather short-shorts aside (shorts that were sometimes trimmed in mink\u2014you never know when you might need a muff), and just think how fabulous it would be to have an all-black wardrobe of leather blazers, lace blouses, perfect skinny jeans and just about the best fedora money can buy\u2014unless you\u2019ve had it made to measure.\n\nSaint Laurent Runway Show Fall/Winter 2018 (Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images) Saint Laurent Runway Show Fall/Winter 2018 (Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images) Saint Laurent Runway Show Fall/Winter 2018 (Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images) Saint Laurent Runway Show Fall/Winter 2018 (Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images) Saint Laurent Runway Show Fall/Winter 2018 (Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images) 1 / 5\n\nShoulders were also an important feature, with one side of a dress showing a cold shoulder and the other side going bold, with a shoulder built up to a souffl\u00e9-sized structured pouf at the top of a single wrist-length sleeve.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther silhouette statements were linebacker-worthy square shoulders and plunging V-necklines on black dresses printed with electric-blue, taxi-yellow or hot-pink florals cut way below the sternum, which would look just as cool as a tunic over a turtleneck and leggings.

Black victory wings spread from the bridge of the nose to the tail of the eyebrow, using the brand\u2019s Eye Marker to line the entire eye and the Eye Duo Smoker pencil for creating the smoldering eye effect.\n\nEven though the Saint Laurent woman projects a dark and decadent aesthetic, she knows you still need some sparkle.

Lots and lots of pain. Unfortunately, it won\u2019t be like a Betty Wright track in which said pain will yield some gain. It will just hurt.\n\n\n\nThere will also be plenty of stupidity because if the confirmation hearings are any indication, we will be beset by inept buffoons, who, much like the 45th president of the United States, have absolutely no business doing the jobs with which they have been tasked.\n\nOf course, there will be loads of corruption because when you elect a con man to the highest office in the land, he\u2019s going to give you your money\u2019s worth.\n\nHowever, of all the nuisances that await us, one that\u2019s increasingly sticking out to me is that we will be embarking on having the political Ike and Tina Turner in Mango Zedong (Donald Trump) and Vladimir Putin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor quite some time now, Frack and Fuck-Up have been whispering sweet nothings to each other in the public space, reminding me of a Drake song in which he is oh so smitten, only to end up vexed over the fact that she has dared to have a life aside from him.\n\nIf previous comments are any indication, these two will very much behave like a celebrity couple desperately trying to sway you into giving a damn about their union. Recently, Geppetto (Putin) took up for his new boo thang (Mango Zedong) by addressing the now infamous dossier in which a former MI6 British intelligence agent claims that the Russian government has compromising information about the new U.S. president. During a press conference Tuesday, Putin said, \u201cThese things that have been alleged are clearly false information.\u201d\n\n(Because if you want truth, you turn to a man trained in the art of lying like hell for the advancement of specific agents.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmong the various forms of malarkey the lying head of state presented to a forced audience, though, this portion was particularly comical: \u201cDid Trump really come and meet with Moscow prostitutes? Firstly, he is an adult, and secondly, he is a person who for many years has organized a beauty pageant, socialized with the most beautiful women in the world. It is hard to believe that he ran to a hotel to meet with our girls of a low social class, although they are the best in the world.\u201d\n\nThis is not how prostitution works, but it\u2019s clearly a sign of someone standing by his man. I suppose if the former KGB agent allegedly put in all that effort to housebreak his new pet, it would make sense for him to go above and beyond to protect him. You know, even if that means saying with a straight face that loads of women want to smash a man who looks like a pot of lasagna made from old slices of Kraft cheese.\n\nStill, it was already stomach-churning to watch an American campaigning to be president laud an authoritarian figure from a hostile foreign government, but now we have to spend maybe four years living with this.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the crowds in Washington, D.C., were thin-crust pizza for the inauguration, it was apparently a lituation over in Moscow. Indeed, The Independent reported that supporters of Putin held an all-night party in celebration of the U.S. president who U.S. intelligence agencies all agree benefited from the assistance of the Russian government in winning the presidential election.\n\nAdam Lusher wrote: \u201cOne of the organizers, Konstantin Rykov, who has served as a Russian MP affiliated to Putin\u2019s United Russia Party and has also been described as a \u2018Kremlin web propagandist,\u2019 invited his Facebook followers to the event with the comment: \u2018See you in the evening. Washington will be ours.\u2019\u201d\n\nDespite the new administration\u2019s claims to the contrary, we undoubtedly will soon have to bear the sight of Mango Zedong and Putin standing side-by-side in jubilee like they\u2019re Ja Rule and Ashanti about to perform \u201cAlways on Time.\u201d While there is a special shade of irony in the guy who promised to \u201cMake America great again\u201d being so clingy to the de facto dictator of Russia, it is not enough to gloss over how infuriating it is to see such a low-level ruse happen in real time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor far too long, black folks have had their patriotism questioned. This would include the first black president of the United States, who has shown far greater faith in this nation than it arguably deserves. Yet this wealthy, spoiled white man has had everything handed to him in life (or he swindled it from people without serious repercussions), and still he refuses to criticize someone who has shown nothing but contempt for the country he\u2019s been elected to run. He loves his new Russian boyfriend like his name is Ivanka Trump. Sad!\n\nThe dick can\u2019t be that good\u2014at least not as strong as whatever Putin seems to have over the 45th president.

But she still relied on longtime stylist Anita Patrickson to pull together the look for her entire wedding party of 12\u2014plus groom\u2014in record time: The couple wed a mere three months after the 24-year-old Shepard\u2019s unabashedly romantic birthday proposal to Iman on the balcony of their apartment, overlooking the New York City skyline.\n\nGood thing Iman said yes, because Shepard had also arranged a surprise 27th-birthday party for his new fiancee, where they then celebrated their engagement with friends and family!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIman told Brides magazine: \u201cMy stylist, Anita Patrickson, really took control and handled dressing the entire wedding party. We\u2019ve worked together for more than five years, so she has a real understanding of what I gravitate toward. ... [I wanted] something that I would like for years to come and that wouldn\u2019t feel dated as trends change.\u201d\n\nWhile the groom wore Hugo Boss, the bride ultimately chose a pair of classically romantic dresses from the Fall 2018 collection of Lebanese designer Zuhair Murad, telling Vogue: \u201cHis pieces always fit and complement my body, and his beadwork is exquisite.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMurad was mutually thrilled to be part of Iman\u2019s special day, saying: \u201cChanel is a fashion chameleon. ... She can easily morph from a cool street style [look] to black-tie formal, and I\u2019ve had the pleasure of dressing her in a full range of my designs, from a sexy silhouette with cut-outs to a ball gown with a train. No matter what look she decides to wear, she\u2019s always effortlessly beautiful.\u201d\n\nIman was indeed a classically beautiful bride, choosing to wear the designer\u2019s floral embroidered and appliqu\u00e9d silk tulle \u201cCamilla\u201d dress for the ceremony with a matching cathedral-length veil and diamond-and-pearl drop earrings by Neil Lane. The gown took over 100 hours to create and featured a plunging neckline and an unexpectedly traditional touch: a matching capelet. It was a surprising choice, even for the bride, as Iman admitted:\n\nI never really envisioned wearing something like that for my wedding, but the moment I put it on, we all loved it. It\u2019s so chic and unusual but also something that felt a little vintage. It was a little more demure for the actual vows. ... The fact that it was interesting from the back was something that I really loved, as guests tend to have that view for a portion of the service, something I think often gets overlooked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer gorgeous bridal party was full of brown- and black-girl magic dressed in white\u2014including fellow models Heidy de la Rosa and Maybelline campaign star Jourdan Dunn. Their subtly sexy, goddess-styled chiffon \u201cAldridge\u201d gowns were designed by bridal behemoth Watters and flattering on every one of Iman\u2019s six bridemaids, and complemented with nude heels from Aldo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the ceremony, Shepard swapped his black tux jacket for an ivory version, while his bride changed into a second Zuhair Murad creation: his blush pink \u201cChristie\u201d gown with a deep-V neckline and a blush bow cinching the waist. For the reception, the bride also let her hair down\u2014literally\u2014trading her sleek ceremony chignon for loose waves, pulled back over one ear with a dazzling piece of hair jewelry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbout the addition of color, Murad said, \u201cBrides today are incorporating more color into their various wedding looks, and I love the subtle contrast of the blush tulle underskirt and sash on this gown for a fresh and feminine look.\u201d\n\nIman agreed: \u201cThe pink and the deep V-neckline really appealed to my \u2018girlier\u2019 side, and it\u2019s a shape I really love wearing,\u201d the bride told Vogue. \u201cMost importantly, I wanted to be comfortable and able to dance.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIman\u2019s dress choice complemented her rose-drenched wedding, designed by acclaimed wedding planner Mindy Weiss\u2014her mother even walked her down the aisle in a rose-colored pantsuit.

Since the age of 13, her love of beauty, business entrepreneurship, wanderlust and a hustle that just won\u2019t quit have made her one to watch. The Glow Up girl caught up with the avid traveler and founder of Superstar Nail Lacquer to find out what inspires her, how she\u2019s nailing the beauty game (and several other burgeoning businesses) and where this entrepreneurial prodigy is headed next:\n\nAriana Pierce: When I was a young girl, my mom would get me a lot of books and Mary Kate and Ashley videos that had to do with travel: Passport to Paris, Holiday in the Sun and When in Rome, to name a few.

I wanted to help women everywhere feel beautiful, stylish and safe. Fast-forward to 17 years old: Freshman year at Michigan State, I wanted to launch myself in the beauty and cosmetic industries, so that\u2019s when I started. Being new to college and starting a business, I was always working.\n\nPhoto: Ariana Pierce (ArianaPierce.com)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: Career highs and lows?\n\nAP: Lows of my career happened more so in my teens and 20s. I remember being in a room with people three times my age and feeling a bit out of place. Not only did age play a factor, but being a black woman in the cosmetic industry was something that was very new at that time.\n\nWhen I launched my online store at SuperstarNailLacquer.com, I did not post photos of me on my site so that people would not judge my product by a skin color, but by quality. I would get major calls from other brands wanting to collaborate with Superstar on some pretty amazing projects. It was disappointing to find that once these brands met with me in person, the deal went south for what they called \u201ccreative differences.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter so many times of experiencing disappointing outcomes, I decided that I would not let this stop me, so I began to study my industry, educating myself so I would know more than many of those I was meeting with. Over time, my business gained such success online; big brands couldn\u2019t ignore me any longer. One thing I learned from this is that no matter how others treat you, there is no room for excuses. If you put your mind, will and heart into your business, you can be successful.\n\n[My] career high was being featured on Forbes\u2019 Business of Influence series. Forbes is one of those things that had always been on my dream list.\n\nTGU: How do you manage to have a successful brand and a life at the same time?\n\n\n\nAP: It\u2019s all about scheduling time to do what you want and at the same time have a successful business.

The three-time Academy Award nominee, who won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for 2016\u2019s Fences\u201a is a regular on the awards circuit and is often called the \u201cblack Meryl Streep\u201d\u2014to which she rightly responds, \u201c[then] pay me what I\u2019m worth.\u201d\n\n\n\nIndeed, it\u2019s Davis\u2019 frank, fearless and unfailing honesty\u2014in her acting roles, her rising visibility as an advocate for equal rights and pay, and her willingness to talk about her own experiences of poverty and sexual abuse\u2014that has so endeared her to us.\n\nSo it\u2019s no surprise that Davis didn\u2019t hold back when speaking to digital magazine Porter Edit about the game-changing opportunity that came with playing Annalise Keating, the character that elevated her from supporting film roles into a leading\u2014and sexually liberated\u2014lady of television drama:\n\nI\u2019m 52 and darker than a paper bag. Women who look like me are relegated to the back of the bus, auditioning for crackheads and mammas and the person with a hand on her hip who is always described as \u2018sassy\u2019 or \u2018soulful\u2019. I\u2019ve had a 30-year career and I have rarely gotten roles that are fleshed out, even a little bit. I mean, you wouldn\u2019t think [these characters] have a vagina. Annalise Keating has changed the game. I don\u2019t even care if she doesn\u2019t make sense. I love that she\u2019s unrestricted, that every week I actually have to fight [showrunner] Peter Nowalk not to have another love scene. When does that ever happen?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat liberation has also been a revelation for Davis, who had to tap into a previously unexplored aspect of her tremendous talent to be free enough to play a woman in touch with her own sexuality and desire. Part of that process was realizing that sexiness doesn\u2019t only come in one package:\n\n... because very rarely in my career \u2013 and in my life \u2013 have I been allowed to explore that part of myself, to be given permission to know that is an aspect of my humanity, that I desire and am desired. I always felt in playing sexuality you have to look a certain way, to be a certain size, to walk a certain way. Until I realized that what makes people lean in is when they see themselves. There\u2019s no way I am going to believe that all women who are sexualized are size zero or two, all have straight hair, all look like sex kittens every time they go to bed and want sex from their man, all are heterosexual. I am mirroring women. I always say it is not my job to be sexy, it\u2019s my job to be sexual. That\u2019s the difference.\n\nDavis goes on to discuss the wage gap in Hollywood, referencing the recent move by actress Jessica Chastain to ensure that she and her Oscar-winning co-star Octavia Spencer would make equal pay on their next film together. Says Davis: \u201cCaucasian women have to stand in solidarity with us. And they have to understand we are not in the same boat.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd as both a Hollywood heavyweight and a survivor of sexual abuse, when asked if the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements would have gained momentum if brought forward by women of color, she is emphatically clear:\n\nNo. Recy Taylor came forward in 1944 when she was gang raped by six men in Alabama. Tarana Burke was the founder of the #MeToo movement in 2006. There are plenty of black women who have come forward. I don\u2019t think people feel we deserve the same empathy. Or investment. We are not as valued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavis has plenty more to say on the hypocrisy of Hollywood and how she navigates it as a black woman.

Ok, I see a few of you in the back with your hands up, and I commend you wonky motherfuckers for staying awake that day in 10th grade civics class and retaining that lesson for the last 20 years. Unfortunately, I presume that most people reading this kept their hands where mine are \u2014 in my pockets. And, like me, were very familiar with how the electoral college process worked, but never quite knew until this year that a member of the electoral college could conceivably just say \"Fuck it\" and choose against the candidate their state voted for.\n\nOf course, opting out has actually happened so few times before that the electors' choice is regarded as a formality. But this year's election has been so jarring and devastating that it's had us searching and hoping for any type of contingency plan or last second salvo to prevent the inevitable. Including, today, the paradoxical dynamic of having faith in the faithless elector.\n\nAnyway, it's pretty much confirmed now that Russia did attempt to sabotage the election, and that the purpose of their political vandalism was to help Donald Trump get elected. And while we're not sure if Vladimir Putin interfered because he has an affinity for Trump or because he believed a Trump victory would make America weaker (or both), it's also been confirmed that he was directly involved with the hacking.\n\nThis is not exactly new news. Even before both the CIA and the FBI pointed to Russia, it was long suspected that Russia was somehow behind the leaks. But between our intelligence agencies agreeing on something for the first time ever and that we also now know that Republican leadership knew about this but chose to keep it a secret, there seems to be an urge for something to be done about this. I'm not sure what actually could be done \u2014 this isn't teeball and we're not getting an election do-over \u2014 but something has to be done. Because Russia. And Russia is bad.\n\nI just\u2026I don't know man. I mean, I know Putin is essentially the devil incarnate. And I'm not particularly happy that we allowed another country to wield such an influence on us. But I just can't muster much outrage about it, especially when it just means that over 60 million Americans were either gullible or racist enough (or both) to vote for Trump. 60 million deplorable motherfuckers the rest of us have to share space with, live next to, and sometimes even work for. They are the imminent threat. They are the national security risk. They are the ones who ultimately committed a treasonous act. They are the ones the international community should hold in contempt and the United Nations should sanction. They are the ones who need to be monitored, forced to register, and barred from entering airports, shopping malls, and Target. Being pissed at Russia for the election is like being mad at the person who fucked your spouse. Regardless of what they said or how flirty and forward they were, your spouse still made the decision to cheat. Putin could have hacked every email account, every Facebook page, and inserted subliminal messaging on everyone's Pinterest visionboards. Shit, Putin could have done that and offered free lollipops and lapdances and it wouldn't have mattered if there weren't so many small, stupid, and shitty people here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis \u2014 and not the faithless electors or how the F.B.I. influenced the election or recounts or Russia just deciding to go Peak Russia \u2014 is what we collectively need to be concerned about and focused on. What the fuck are we going to do about the tens of millions of people who voted for this, who want all the terrible things that are happening to happen? And, it's not like we can just contain them to Montana and Outback Steakhouses either. They're everywhere. They're our neighbors, they're at our jobs, they're behind us in line at Giant Eagle, they're in our families. Raise your hand, please, if you have a good answer.\n\nShit.

Paris Fashion Week ended with natural hair trending strongly on the runways, and Louis Vuitton\u2019s show was no exception. Along with showcasing natural hair, designer Nicholas Ghesqui\u00e8re returned to the house of Louis Vuitton this season after a long absence from the runways and showed his own variation of the primary colors in patchwork patterns that appeared in designer collections on almost every Fall/Winter 2018-2019 catwalk. Ghesqui\u00e8re\u2019s interpretation showed up on corset belts that are a sexy and simple-to-wear update for a fall wardrobe.\n\nBlack against primary or neon colors is also a directional color theme for fall. Vuitton illustrated a prevailing mood in fashion that sexy has its place, but only if it also somehow says power. For instance, notice a flounce of details on one side of the shirt tucked into a high-waisted belt, so as not to be over-the-top (no pun intended) sexy. And elements of menswear like tweed were feminized with beaded trims and ruffles, creating a capelet effect as a pretty version of padded power shoulders.\n\nOpera-length gloves for both day and night were another fixture in the accessories category this season. Whether in satin, leather or neoprene, they quickly elevate an outfit to fashionista status with the snap of the wrist.\n\nMeanwhile, athleisure is fading away from the fashion footrace, with sneakers being outpaced by chunky-but-elegant heels. Take note, fashion lovers: Bold straps also pick up the patchwork theme on shoes and boots. At Vuitton, other microtrends that added up to a big new look for fall were stripes, lariats and shoulder-duster earrings with statement pearls on delicate chains.\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images 1 / 10\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can check out the full Louis Vuitton presentation below and let The Glow Up know which looks you love.

Wearing traditional head wraps, cloaked in clouds of Marabou feathers fresh off the couture runway of Saint Laurent, the two wonderful women\u2014both of whom I\u2019m lucky enough to call friends\u2014epitomize regal beauty.\n\n\n\nIman\u2014well, she\u2019s Iman. What more needs to be said? \u201cBaby Girl Imaan,\u201d as I call her; she\u2019s the model of the moment. She has already appeared on multiple Vogue covers and is slaying it one sexy step at a time on every designer runway from New York to Tokyo.\n\nIn his monthly letter, Vogue Arabia Editor-in-Chief Manuel Arnaut writes of his choice of this iconic issue\u2019s cover girls:\n\nI truly believe that a cover should also encapsulate a message of hope and go above and beyond just a pretty image. This is exactly what we tried to achieve when we invited two of the biggest models with strong ties to the Arab world to be our March cover stars.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRight now, fashion-philes are hoofing it all over the globe to get their hands on one of the special-edition issues, where Iman shares her thoughts on her lifelong career in fashion, from being discovered as a model in 1975 to her fight for equal pay as a black model. (It\u2019s a fight black models continue to wage every day; just last week, Naomi Campbell posted on Instagram that she contended with the same issue last December when she shot the Swarovski campaign.)\n\nIman also speaks openly to Vogue about reconciling her religion with her career. She says, \u201cIt is an oxymoron to have your foot in the modeling business and to call yourself a Muslim, but at the end of the day, you need to look in the mirror and feel good when you ask, \u2018Am I doing the right thing?\u2019\u201d\n\nHammam, like every other black model walking the runway and smiling for the camera today, praises Iman for paving the way for all black girls. Hamman tells Vogue that she is also fiercely proud of being at the forefront of the ongoing diversity movement. \u201cFashion is all about having a personality\u2014and nothing is as inspiring as the power of being you,\u201d she says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScreenshot: Patrick Demarchelier (Vogue.me)\n\nThe choice of head wraps for the cover at once inspires pride and curiosity about the history of the head wrap. Nnenna Stella, owner of Brooklyn, N.Y.-based the Wrap Life, created the cover look using a prototype for a forthcoming collection of traditional scarves, which will retail on her website for a reasonable $24-$27.\n\nLanding any cover, let alone a historic and collectible cover like the anniversary issue of Vogue Arabia, was literally the answer to this entrepreneur\u2019s prayers. \u201cI\u2019ve never wrapped that way before,\u201d Stella says of the Nefertiti-esque black-and-white silk-chiffon turbans created for the cover. \u201cMy fingers were just flowing, and that is essentially what I tell my clients to do.\u201d The Wrap Life\u2019s head wraps are 2 yards long and between 22 and 24 inches wide. \u201cA wrap is just a piece of fabric,\u201d she says. \u201cEverything else we wear, like pants, are precut for us so we know how to wear it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIronically, Stella did not grow up wearing head wraps. She tells The Glow Up that when she founded the Wrap Life five years ago, \u201cI was waitressing, and really sad about it; my photography career wasn\u2019t working out.\u201d After 30 days of an ad hoc self-discovery workshop\u2014which, among other things, included keeping a journal marked \u201cWild Things Can Happen\u201d\u2014she wanted to change up her look as part of the spiritual reboot.\n\n\u201cNormally, you\u2019d just get a lipstick or a haircut,\u201d Stella says. But she was looking for that \u201cone extra thing [she] could do.\u201d That extra form of expression turned out to be wearing a head wrap. The look quickly became her signature, and when she couldn\u2019t find head wraps she liked online, it became her business.

I say that because, often, clothes can be pretty but puzzling at the same time. Now, under the direction of designer Maria Grazia Chiuri, Dior speaks to women loud and clear. What\u2019s Grazia Chiuri got to say? For one, \u201cWe Should All Be Feminists\u201d\u2014the theme of her breakout collection for the house of Dior for Spring 2017.\n\nThe theme was taken from the essay of the same name written by the Nigerian writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, a brilliant manifesto on womanhood and citizenship that reads like the Wakandan Bill of Rights. Most people who wear the now ubiquitous T-shirt don\u2019t know its origin, but they\u2019ve gotten the message that the future is female.\n\nChimamanda Ngozi Adichie (Ted Talks)\n\nWhich brings us to Wednesday\u2019s Dior Fall/Winter 2018/2019 presentation in Paris, where Dior\u2019s women were still on the march. The collection was inspired by Paris\u2019 \u201cyouthquake\u201d in the summer of 1968, when students literally took to the streets, ripping cobblestones from the ground and hurling them at police, demanding better employment opportunities and reform of the university system. Being ever fashion-minded, young women protested long hemlines in front of the Dior boutique, brandishing signs reading, \u201cSupport the Mini Skirt.\u201d\n\nGrazia Chiuri, who is Italian and the former designer of Valentino, stumbled upon the photo while searching Dior\u2019s archives, as she recounted to London\u2019s Guardian newspaper:\n\nAnd then I discovered that [Marc] Bohan\u2019s response, [who designed Dior at the time], to this was to introduce the Miss Dior line, to give these younger consumers what they wanted. I thought it was so interesting to see fashion listening to women. And there is something about now that is similar to 1968. This is another moment when everything is changing.\n\nYes, we are again in a moment when everything is changing regarding women in the workplace and shaping the perception of our own beauty and our bodies. With the advent of social media\u2014which in this writer\u2019s opinion has done as much for black women\u2019s beauty as hip-hop has done for black men\u2019s voices\u2014we are in an era of unparalleled agency on our own behalf. Grazia Chiuri is listening, and poised to provide us the uniform.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDior Fall 2018 Paris Runway (Dominique Charriau/Getty/WireImage) Dior Fall \u201918 Paris Runway (Dominique Charriau/Getty/WireImage) Dior Fall \u201918 Paris Runway (Dominique Charriau Getty/WireImage) Dior Fall \u201918 Paris Runway (Dominique Charriau Getty/WireImage) 1 / 4\n\nThe clothes at Dior this week were a throwback to a time when flower power and femininity were one and the same. Long, easy dresses in bright floral prints, patchwork coats and rose-colored glasses to no doubt help us get through dark times sailed down the runway with a youthful ease. Mixed in were sweaters emblazoned with slogans like \u201cC\u2019est non, non et non\u201d (\u201cIt\u2019s no, no and no\u201d), in a nod to the new-age rules of sexual consent.\n\nAnother strong theme shown at Dior and trending across runways from New York, London, Milan and now Paris this season were relaxed boxy blazers worn over kilts and pleated skirts. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s so much that designers want women to be schoolgirls, but it\u2019s a way to show that women are teaching the world right now\u2014and changing the rules for the better.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarch on, ladies. On this first day of Women\u2019s History Month, we owe our mothers a debt and our daughters a future of freedom and dignity for womanhood across the globe.

Olympia was born on Sept. 1, 2017.\n\nThe pregnancy was smooth, Williams says, but 24 hours after she gave birth, a slew of complications kept the new mother in bed for nearly six weeks.\n\nWilliams writes:\n\nIt began with a pulmonary embolism, which is a condition in which one or more arteries in the lungs becomes blocked by a blood clot. Because of my medical history with this problem, I live in fear of this situation. So, when I fell short of breath, I didn\u2019t wait a second to alert the nurses. This sparked a slew of health complications that I am lucky to have survived. First my C-section wound popped open due to the intense coughing I endured as a result of the embolism. I returned to surgery, where the doctors found a large hematoma, a swelling of clotted blood, in my abdomen. And then I returned to the operating room for a procedure that prevents clots from traveling to my lungs. When I finally made it home to my family, I had to spend the first six weeks of motherhood in bed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliams acknowledges that in her ordeal, she had privileges not afforded to many: a strong, committed team of doctors and nurses and state-of-the-art equipment, for instance. Had it not been for their able care, Williams writes, she may have died.\n\nBut the point of telling her story, which she also shared in an earlier interview for Vogue\u2019s February issue, was to illustrate the vast discrepancies in maternal care that women from different races and backgrounds experience. Provoked by her near-death experience, Williams looked more deeply into inequity and maternal care, and was bothered by the lack of action.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, black women in the United States are over three times more likely to die from pregnancy or childbirth-related causes,\u201d Williams writes. She adds that outside the U.S., limited access to prenatal and maternal care means that millions of women have the cards similarly \u201cstacked against them.\u201d\n\nAs another CNN article notes, instances of maternal death have increased across racial groups in the U.S. in recent years, but the racial divide in deaths has persisted. The issue has been brought to the forefront recently as high-profile cases like the death of Shalon Irving, an expert on racial disparities in health care, and Williams\u2019 complications have been reported and discussed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the end of her essay, Williams implores readers to demand action from governments, businesses and health care providers to protect the lives of babies and their mothers.\n\n\u201cIn doing so, you become part of this narrative,\u201d Williams writes, \u201cmaking sure that one day, who you are or where you are from does not decide whether your baby gets to live or to die.\u201d", "keywords": ["learned", "birth", "women", "giving", "writes", "serena", "reveals", "health", "experience", "complications", "care", "neardeath", "racial", "maternal", "williams"], "polarity": 0.150748556998557, "subjectivity": 0.47032026615359945},

No!\u201d And I will say, that is one-hundred percent white people who say that to me.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe anecdote has stuck with me for weeks. It stuck with me as I watched the New York Times\u2019 election needle tremble back and forth during Alabama\u2019s special election, in which an alleged pedophile, Roy Moore, was nearly sent to the U.S. Senate. It dug in when I saw a statistic that echoed to a similar one regarding Donald Trump voters from November of last year: Sixty-three percent of white women voted for Moore. And when pundits began their near-instant erasure of that fact, Williams\u2019 anecdote, relayed with wide-eyed disbelief by the actress, rose up like detritus stirred up by a current.\n\nThe truly radical thing about Get Out, the horror it captures with precision and clarity, is less about the violence white people can and have exacted on black bodies. What\u2019s truly terrifying about the film, about Rose\u2019s character, is the assumption of white innocence\u2014an innocence that is reflected in white audiences\u2019 insistent belief that Rose is, deep down, good. Chris, the film\u2019s main character, is just as guilty of this as the white audience that approaches Williams. It\u2019s as if the delusion of innocence is itself a kind of hypnosis, even as the evidence of villainy is literally written on the wall (\u201cShe has photos of people whose lives she ended behind her\u201d).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2017, I learned that the fulcrum of white supremacy isn\u2019t violence, as I had always thought. It was virtue.\n\nI understand that, to many, this isn\u2019t a particularly new or bold revelation, but I had gotten used to thinking of white supremacy in terms of violence: of physical violence, but also emotional trauma, the plunder of one\u2019s body as well as one\u2019s mind and one\u2019s wealth. It wasn\u2019t until talking to Joe Feagin, a professor at Texas A&M University who is credited with coining the term \u201csystemic racism,\u201d that I was introduced to the concept of white virtue\u2014and how it was the axis on which white supremacy turns.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn his theory of the \u201cwhite racial frame\u201d\u2014a pro-white worldview that many white and nonwhite people aren\u2019t consciously aware they\u2019ve absorbed\u2014whiteness is seen as inherently good.\n\n\u201cWe whites are trained into seeing ourselves as virtuous. We have the most virtuous history. We have the most advanced civilization,\u201d Feagin explained. \u201cWe speak the best-quality English. We have the best beauty images, especially for women. All of those things ... civilization, history, values, religion, virtues, work ethic.\u201d\n\nAnd, Feagin adds, it\u2019s the hardest element of socialized racism for white people to dismantle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was hard for me, a biracial Filipina, to wrap my head around this at first. Aren\u2019t all people, all tribes, convinced of their goodness? Doesn\u2019t that need for self-preservation, to guard the image of yourself as virtuous, sit deep within everyone?\n\nWe can\u2019t count the number of black and brown lives this country has plundered and broken in the name of white virtue: to preserve white neighborhoods and white voting booths, to keep women and bloodlines \u201cpure\u201d and politics \u201cclean.\u201d\n\nBut the difference is one of scale and cost: This nation codified the value of whiteness into its earliest laws: laying out who exactly was and wasn\u2019t white. Detailing and revising exactly what that whiteness earned you. Whiteness (along with maleness, along with money) was a virtue. And from those who did not meet its qualifications, this country extracted a steep price.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe evidence of this inclination to insist on white virtue is everywhere. There\u2019s the obvious: the white supremacists and white nationalists who refuse to cede any political or cultural ground to people of color; the neo-Nazis and the Holocaust deniers. Fringe groups who assumed center stage in American discourse in 2017.\n\nBut it\u2019s evident in smaller offenses. Rhetorically, it\u2019s in the way Ryan Lochte, a 33-year-old Olympic swimmer, can be called a \u201cboy\u201d when he engages in criminal behavior. It\u2019s evident in the way white people\u2019s racist performances\u2014the nigger jokes, the blackface\u2014can be excused as \u201cjust jokes.\u201d It\u2019s the ease with which white people (and lots of nonblack people) can slip into caricatures of African Americans that paint them as lazy, incompetent or immoral. It\u2019s evident in the quick and ready defenses some white people provide when faced with uncomfortable conversations about systemic racism: Yeah, but I had nothing to do with that. That was a long time ago. It\u2019s not like I owned slaves. I wasn\u2019t there.\n\n\n\nThis, despite the fact that we can\u2019t count the number of black and brown lives this country has plundered and broken in the name of white virtue: to preserve white neighborhoods and white voting booths, to keep women and bloodlines \u201cpure\u201d and politics \u201cclean.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA comfortable delusion. A self-serving hypnosis. An insistence on innocence that delays a reckoning.\n\nI\u2019m not shocked that there are white audiences who see Rose and still insist on seeing a victim, on drawing some strand of virtue from a character who is clearly aware of what she is doing and delights in it. If we consider white virtue to be the fulcrum of white supremacy, nobody symbolizes this virtue more than white women.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn this way, you see Rose everywhere.\n\nYou see it when Betsy DeVos is looked at as an incompetent stooge rather than an active, knowledgeable participant in dismantling our public education system. You see it in the false feminism and performative innocence of Ivanka Trump, a woman credited with helping push the GOP\u2019s tax bill\u2014an enormous wealth transfer for the rich\u2014through Congress. You see it in the silence of white Hollywood when their black peers are attacked or exploited (this pattern, of course, extends to other industries). In 2017, Rose was just as likely to wear a pussy hat as a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d shirt.\n\nThe cruelty that extends the cut? Even as we\u2019re surrounded by the evidence of Rose\u2019s crimes (look no further than the White House), many are reluctant to reckon with the woman in the mirror. To part with their innocence. To break the hypnosis that continues to bind and betray us all.", "keywords": ["virtue", "shes", "women", "supremacy", "armitage", "2017", "white", "rose", "innocence", "violence", "black"], "polarity": 0.06526736813871553, "subjectivity": 0.3853764921946739},

Case in point: For the first time since Naomi Campbell\u2019s opening strut back in 1997, Prada tapped a black model to open its fashion show (Jourdan Dunn is the only other black model to be booked by this global powerhouse brand since 2008). The coveted career-making position went to 19-year-old Sudanese model of the moment, Anok Yai.\n\nPrada\n\nYai, who was raised in Egypt, was discovered when photographer Steven Hall\u2019s Afrocentric street-style blog The Sunk posted a photo of her at Howard\u2019s 2017 homecoming that went viral last fall. Now exploding with over 144,000 Instagram followers, she\u2019s poised to blow all the way up.\n\nLuckily, Yai happens to be represented by Kyle Hagler, president of Next Models. Hagler, one of the most powerful agents in the business, also happens to be black. Booking Prada is a triumph for model and agent alike, and though, in my opinion, the brand has a very long way to go before I would support it with my dollars or clicks, it is clearly evolving.\n\nBut overall, Milan showed a lot of beautiful black women on its fall runways. Natural hair and glowing skin were the order of the day, from Versace to Fendi.\n\nAt Versace, \u201990s neon brights mixed with punk and ska-inspired plaid and black-and-white checks were the theme. Mixed patterns and bright colors are classic vintage Versace\u2014an exuberant kind of youth riot that fashion insiders and consumers can\u2019t seem to get enough of, judging by the FX hit miniseries American Crime Story: The Assassination of Gianni Versace, not to mention the number of Versace heritage prints I once again see people wearing on the streets of New York.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProving that the trend is catching, Prada was also full of neon brights and industrial-inspired designs that reminded me a bit of designer Virgil Abloh\u2019s aesthetic at Off-White.\n\nVersace Fall/Winter 2018 (Catwalking/Getty Images) Versace Fall/Winter 2018 (Catwalking/Getty Images) Versace Fall/Winter 2018 (Catwalking/Getty Images) Versace Fall/Winter 2018 (Catwalking/Getty Images) Versace Fall/Winter 2018 (Catwalking/Getty Images) 1 / 5\n\nFendi never disappoints.

As a model, I worked very closely with designers who, in the \u201990s, did private showings after the main press presentations, offering to lengthen skirts and create matching hijabs for distribution to conservative Muslim clients.

Sexism is a national problem and deserves a commensurate response from our leaders. Our current systems\u2014including those in colleges and universities\u2014protect powerful men and permit rape culture to continue.\n\n\n\nThe Weinstein case highlights how poorly Education Secretary Betsy DeVos\u2019 policies on sex discrimination and assault meet the needs of women.\n\nIn late September, DeVos rescinded an Obama directive, also known as the \u201cDear Colleague Letter\u201d (pdf), on how campuses should handle sexual assaults under Title IX, the federal policy on sexual discrimination. The letter reminded campus officials that they were responsible for preventing sexual harassment and violence, and provided examples of remedies and enforcement strategies. DeVos repealed the Obama policy largely based on a defense of people wrongfully accused of sexual assault.\n\n\u201cThere are men and women, boys and girls, who are survivors,\u201d DeVos said in her speech on Title IX in September. \u201cAnd there are men and women, boys and girls who are wrongfully accused.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIncredibly, DeVos used an \u201cAll victims matter\u201d rationale to rescind the Obama directive. The speciousness of this argument is made apparent by the fact that not once did she utter the word \u201csexism\u201d in her prepared remarks.\n\nThe Weinstein case\u2014and the subsequent waves of disclosures about men in power that continue to break\u2014should force DeVos to confront what she obviously ignored in her argument for repeal: Powerful institutions (especially those led by men) ignore women\u2019s accounts of being harassed, abused and assaulted.\n\nWorse, they are so hostile toward women and so protective of influential men that victims are scared to speak out. Witness all the accounts of women who stayed silent about the assaults and harassment for decades, or those who spoke up and say they experienced retaliation\u2014all while Weinstein sat untouched atop a Miramax empire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf it wasn\u2019t evident to DeVos earlier, it should be clear now: She needs a do-over. As more and more women come forward, DeVos should hear the cries of sexual assault victims and actually make Title IX more about addressing systems and less about finding some weird moral equivalency between victims and accusers.\n\nTwo months before DeVos rescinded the guidance, Candice E. Jackson, DeVos\u2019 acting assistant secretary for civil rights in the Department of Education, told the New York Times that 90 percent of sexual assault complaints \u201cfall into the category of \u2018We were both drunk,\u2019 \u2018We broke up, and six months later, I found myself under a Title IX investigation because she just decided that our last sleeping together was not quite right.\u2019\u201d\n\nAfter widespread outrage at the suggestion that women were equally culpable in most sexual assault cases on campus, Jackson apologized. She has since walked back her statement a bit, stating before a Senate panel last week, \u201cIt\u2019s unproductive to speak in terms of false accusations.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the Dear Colleague Letter issued by the department that DeVos now leads, there were \u201c4,000 reported incidents of sexual battery and over 800 reported rapes and attempted rapes occurring in our nation\u2019s public high schools.\u201d More than 1 in 10 will have been sexually assaulted in or out of school before high school graduation, and \u201c20 percent of women will be victims of attempted or actual sexual assault, as will about 6 percent of undergraduate men.\u201d\n\nWe should treat Weinstein as an individual monster\u2014and as a product of our educational system. The former we cannot change, but how our schools and colleges treat victims and the accused, that we can.\n\nPresident Barack Obama sought to prioritize the rights of the victims by telling colleges to allow accusers to appeal not guilty findings, to discourage cross-examination of accusers and to accelerate verdicts. Obama urged colleges to consistently use the \u201cpreponderance of evidence,\u201d or what is more likely than not, standard in sexual assault cases. The preponderance of evidence is considered the lowest degree of evidence necessary to establish proof, which empowers women to name rapists. The higher the standard for proving an assault, the less likely it is that women will come forward.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe should treat Weinstein as an individual monster\u2014and as a product of our educational system. The former we cannot change, but how our schools and colleges treat victims and the accused, that we can.\n\nMany colleges resisted, arguing that the preponderance-of-evidence standard was too low a bar and would invite false accusations. In addition, several of the accused complained that the Obama guidance robbed defendants of due process, violated their individual rights and disregarded the autonomy of colleges to adjudicate these cases. Colleges also complained that the appeal process under the Obama guidance actually stretched out cases.\n\n\n\nAcquiescing, DeVos replaced Obama-era Title IX polices with an interim guidance (pdf), which gives colleges the freedom to decide what standard of evidence to use. Instead of giving women more choices to name their assailants, DeVos empowered institutions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the tussle between the powerful and the powerless, DeVos has sided with \u201cthe Man.\u201d DeVos\u2019 interim guidance misses the point that powerful men, even within the noblest of institutions, abuse their power to the detriment of women.\n\nWe tend to look at colleges as being progressive or conservative. But we also need to look at them as male-dominated and protecting the interests of men. Even though women make up more than 56 percent of collegians, men constitute 70 percent of college presidents.\n\nCampuses should give victims the benefit of the doubt in cases involving sexual assault. In addition, colleges are the first and last line of defense against a criminal-justice system in which \u201conly a quarter of all reported rapes lead to an arrest, only a fifth lead to prosecution, and only half of those prosecutions result in felony convictions,\u201d according to Know Your IX, a survivor- and youth-led organization focused on ending sexual and dating violence. On and off-campus, due process seems to favor men.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe tend to look at colleges as being progressive or conservative. But we also need to look at them as male-dominated, and protecting the interests of men.\n\nTake convicted rapist Brock Turner as an example. Turner, then a member of the Stanford University swim team, raped an unconscious woman in 2015. Turner was found guilty, and prosecutors sought six years. Turner, a white man, received a mere six-month sentence, a slap on the wrist for what Turner\u2019s father dismissed at the sentencing as \u201c20 minutes of action.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat he did to me doesn\u2019t expire, doesn\u2019t just go away after a set number of years,\u201d wrote the unnamed victim in a letter submitted to the court. \u201cIt stays with me, it\u2019s part of my identity, it has forever changed the way I carry myself, the way I live the rest of my life.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet the judge who sentenced Turner\u2014Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Aaron Persky\u2014said, \u201cA prison sentence would have a severe impact on him.\u201d\n\nNo wonder women often seek and expect justice through the honorable confines of the university.\n\nColleges also have a difficult time adjudicating sexual assault cases. Colleges have different judicial systems and no uniform standard of evidence. The absence of a consistent standard results in the passage of too much time and different levels of justice, which is why federal guidance is needed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is also the legitimate question of whether colleges have the capacity to adjudicate sexual assault cases. But DeVos\u2019 unwillingness to name institutional sexism and gender bias renders her commentary on this front meaningless.\n\nIn the wake of Weinstein, what is more likely than not is the tradition of powerful academic institutions protecting male interests. The reason powerful men get away with rape and harassment is that systems protect them. And until we challenge the systems in our educational institutions, men like Weinstein will continue to find sanctuary in them.\n\nThis story was produced by the Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education, in partnership with The Root.", "keywords": ["assault", "women", "system", "need", "educational", "men", "weinstein", "change", "produce", "victims", "standard", "betsy", "harvey", "helps", "devos", "sexual", "colleges", "obama", "weinsteins"], "polarity": 0.11527717652717653, "subjectivity": 0.4883204493918781},

I wanted to help women everywhere feel beautiful, stylish and safe. Fast-forward to 17 years old: Freshman year at Michigan State, I wanted to launch myself in the beauty and cosmetic industries, so that\u2019s when I started. Being new to college and starting a business, I was always working.\n\nPhoto: Ariana Pierce (ArianaPierce.com)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: Career highs and lows?\n\nAP: Lows of my career happened more so in my teens and 20s. I remember being in a room with people three times my age and feeling a bit out of place. Not only did age play a factor, but being a black woman in the cosmetic industry was something that was very new at that time.\n\nWhen I launched my online store at SuperstarNailLacquer.com, I did not post photos of me on my site so that people would not judge my product by a skin color, but by quality. I would get major calls from other brands wanting to collaborate with Superstar on some pretty amazing projects. It was disappointing to find that once these brands met with me in person, the deal went south for what they called \u201ccreative differences.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter so many times of experiencing disappointing outcomes, I decided that I would not let this stop me, so I began to study my industry, educating myself so I would know more than many of those I was meeting with. Over time, my business gained such success online; big brands couldn\u2019t ignore me any longer. One thing I learned from this is that no matter how others treat you, there is no room for excuses. If you put your mind, will and heart into your business, you can be successful.\n\n[My] career high was being featured on Forbes\u2019 Business of Influence series.

Sitting there in the theater, gazing up at the gorgeous Dora Milaje, the thought occurred to you at least once: Could I pull off a bald head?\n\nPhoto: Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nMaybe your answer was an immediate and unequivocal \u201cNo,\u201d but if there was even a glimmer of curiosity, let\u2019s dig into it. While women have been rocking baldies and fades for centuries now, our hair is often still considered our \u201ccrowning glory.\u201d But is the crown really what\u2019s on your head, or what\u2019s in it?\n\nWith the ongoing popularity of Marvel\u2019s Black Panther, we got not only an eyeful of epic black excellence and battle scenes, but also a bevy of bald beauties, courtesy of Wakanda\u2019s royal guard, the Dora Milaje, led by General Okoye (played by Danai Gurira), who sports not only a clean-shaven head but a tattooed one.\n\nMuch to our delight, long after shooting wrapped, Gurira continued to have fun with the look in real life; even taking to having designs etched into her reverse bald fade, which she rocked to glamorous effect at the Black Panther European premiere.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Gareth Cattermole (Getty Images for Disney)\n\nBut for those of us who aren\u2019t starring in the latest Hollywood blockbuster, is this a look we can realistically pull off? To find out, we reached out to one of our favorite bald beauties, psychiatrist and occasional contributor to The Root, Dr. Imani J. Walker.\n\n\n\nWalker began shaving her head at about the age of 17 while an incoming freshman at Xavier University in New Orleans. Originally arriving at school with the popular \u201990s-era permed-and-cropped cut made famous by Halle Berry, Walker tells The Glow Up that she quickly found the need for a drastic change:\n\nSo, I got down to New Orleans, and it was like 90-something degrees and 120 percent humidity, and my hair was just\u2014I was like, \u201cThis isn\u2019t happening. I\u2019m not looking cute right now.\u201d And then, my roommate at the time, when we met, we had the exact same haircut. And I was like, OK; out of necessity and also because I just hate doing what everybody else is doing, I just cut it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat \u201cbig chop\u201d led to what has become Walker\u2019s trademark look for the past 25 years, a gleaming bald head she shaves every other day. A very active mom and wife on top of her duties as a doctor, she credits her choice of hairstyle\u2014or lack thereof\u2014with making her busy lifestyle simpler.\n\nI\u2019m fairly active\u2014I work out a good six, if not seven, days a week. So one of the things I really love about it is the fact that it\u2019s not, there\u2019s not anything that I have to really be concerned about ... but also on top of that, [if I\u2019m] jumping in the pool, or I\u2019m the middle of the street and the wind blows, it feels really just nice. It\u2019s just a really refreshing feeling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWalker also admits to us that her personal affinity for baldness is as psychological as it is physical:\n\n\n\nI guess, spiritually speaking, I\u2019ve always felt the need [for] my thoughts to be as close to the air as possible; I just need to feel like I have freedom of thought. And for me, that physically just means having the freedom to be able to have my scalp exposed to as many elements possible. But I think more than anything, I like the way it feels, and it just so happens to look good.\n\nBut Walker warns that while lower maintenance, choosing to go bald doesn\u2019t mean no maintenance. She indulges in a strict skin and scalp regimen to keep her look smooth and free of razor bumps, emphasizing that \u201cyou have to give it as much thought as you would give any type of hairstyle.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow does she keep her dome glowing? By taking extreme care with the tools and products she uses. \u201cYou can\u2019t just take Barbasol shaving cream or some plastic cheap razor and just go to your head; you\u2019ll destroy your scalp,\u201d she warns. \u201cYou\u2019ll have razor bumps forever, and it\u2019s not going to be cute.\u201d\n\nTo keep her close shave extra-cute, Walker has her routine down to a science:\n\nFirst, using a barber-grade Wahl trimmer, like the GroomsMan T-Pro, specially made to give a bump-free shave, Walker shaves her entire head.\n\n\n\nNext, she goes over her head with a set of clippers\u2014she likes Wahl\u2019s Ultra Close Cut Pro, crafted specifically for close shaves but less likely to cause razor bumps. While, technically, she has a very close shave, Walker says, \u201cTo the naked eye, it looks like my head is shining.\u201d\n\nAfter shaving, Walker oil cleanses her scalp, stressing that she treats her scalp the way she treats her face, first applying an oil cleanser that she wipes off with a hot washcloth, followed by a turmeric mask to her face and scalp, which helps to decrease inflammation, and does double duty against pimples and razor bumps. Walker\u2019s homemade mask includes turmeric powder, yogurt, rosewater and lemon juice.\n\nOnce out the shower, she applies a toner with salicylic acid, which she says is \u201cvery exciting in a tingling, like, \u2018Oh my God,\u2019 kind of a way\u2014but the tingle at least lets me know that it works!\u201d Afterward, she recommends using a hydrocortisone or steroid cream on the scalp to help nip any inflammation or razor bumps in the bud.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWalker follows this regimen religiously, shaving only every other day to cut down on irritation and get the best results.\n\nBut while Walker absolutely loves her look, she admits that she\u2019s used to getting stares from those who are unaccustomed to seeing a bald woman, which is why it was so refreshing to see the similarly styled Dora Milaje on-screen.\n\n\u201cI went to go see the movie with my son, and we talked a little bit about it after the movie, and he was like, \u2018Well, yeah, it\u2019s like an army of my mom. This is great ... it\u2019s like having my mom, but, like, 10 of them. This is amazing.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd for those who think a woman going bald compromises her femininity, the doctor has this to say:\n\nFemininity to a lot of people equates with being soft. Femininity to me is the ability to have the option to be soft\u2014the option to be whatever you want\u2014but more importantly, it\u2019s to be a woman and powerful. So I feel very feminine with my head shaved ... I\u2019d feel less feminine if I wore a wig or if my bald head were not on display every day. This is my head. I do what I want to do with it. And if they don\u2019t like it, that\u2019s not really my problem. ... But anybody who doesn\u2019t feel that this look is feminine, I think, needs to really re-evaluate what their insecurities are, and why they would feel the need to place their insecurities on someone else.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd because Walker isn\u2019t the only bald baddie in our midst, we did a little roundup of a few of our other favorite beauties who\u2019ve dared to go bare\u2014or, at least, almost there.\n\nFlorence Kasumba attends the European premiere of Black Panther in London Feb. 8, 2018.

But that said, we know it\u2019s not a look every woman can pull off, as Walker aptly notes:\n\nI mean, it\u2019s not for everyone. I do think that everyone should try it, but it\u2019s not necessarily for everyone, because not [everyone\u2019s head] is necessarily evenly shaped. People have asked me \u201cWell, how did you know what your head was going to look like?\u201d I don\u2019t know, I just did it. Just do it. Just try it and see.

Today I am here to admit to white America that I was totally wrong about Orenthal James Simpson. (I know using \u201cwhite\u201d as an adjective to describe \u201cAmerica\u201d is redundant, but I just want to make sure I acknowledge the Caucasians who \u201cbuilt this country\u201d because\u2014aside from history books, movies, television, literature, the national narrative and Donald Trump rallies\u2014you rarely receive the credit you are due. Big ups to you.)\n\nOn Sunday night, Fox News reignited the ire of white people who are still dumbstruck that a man could get away with an obvious murder when the decidedly unfair and mentally imbalanced network aired a decade-old interview of O.J. Simpson appearing to confess, in which he laid out how he might have, theoretically, murdered his ex-wife Nicole Brown and her friend Ron Goldman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhite America, I am now on your side. I couldn\u2019t have been more wrong. You were right all along.\n\nWhite people hate O.J. For them, he is evil incarnate. After all, if a black man could get away with killing a white woman in a wealthy neighborhood, how could anyone feel safe?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can\u2019t fathom how black-hearted I must have seemed back in 1995 when I applauded the O.J. verdict. I now realize how upset you guys must have felt to see a cold-blooded killer like O.J. get set free. Well, actually, I forgot that I felt those same emotions after the George Zimmerman acquittal.\n\nAnd the Betty Shelby trial.\n\nAnd the Philando Castile decision.\n\nAnd the decision not to indict Darren Wilson for the shooting death of Michael Brown Jr.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd the acquittal of Jeronimo Yanez.\n\nOK, I also now realize that saying \u201cI now realize\u201d was probably a bad choice of words.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: I always believed O.J. did that shit.\n\n\n\nWhen black people celebrated the O.J. acquittal in 1995, it was not because we thought he was a symbol of innocence and purity who was preparing to buy NBC. It was because the O.J. case exposed the bigotry that permeates the entire justice system in America and how\u2014despite his celebrity, wealth and resources\u2014a black man could be deemed guilty simply from an outpouring of alabaster outrage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe believed that he was a murderer and we believed the Los Angeles Police Department tried to frame him by tampering with evidence. Both things were probably true. Given black people\u2019s relationship with cops, the then-recent Rodney King verdict, the criminal-justice system and the legacy of black men who were lynched for breathing in the direction of white women, I\u2019m sure you could understand why we celebrated the O.J. verdict. We weren\u2019t on O.J.\u2019s team. We were Team JohnnyCochran. We were #TeamFuckTheLAPD.\n\nThis Lying, Murdering Whore Called America Today\u2014almost a year after a man who took an oath to protect and serve sent a bullet into the skull\u2026 Read more Read\n\nBut before Fox\u2019s O.J. special, I had never seen someone give a detailed explanation of how they murdered an innocent human being with a straight face and showing no remorse. To be fair, I missed George Zimmerman\u2019s interview on Hannity. I also forgot to DVR his appearance on CNN. Oh, and that Daily Beast article where he said that Trayvon Martin\u2019s parents \u201cdidn\u2019t raise him right\u201d and treated him \u201clike a dog without a leash\u201d\u2014I never got around to reading it. So this was my first time witnessing something like this.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut now that O.J. has hypothetically confessed on national television, I understand how you feel that our system shouldn\u2019t let an unrepentant killer walk around white women all willy-nilly. He may have been found not guilty in a court of law, but that doesn\u2019t mean he is innocent. What if he\u2019s triggered by a different pair of thin upper lips or oblate buttocks and goes on another killing spree? We just watched him confess!\n\nI felt the same way about Betty Shelby, who admitted on 60 Minutes that Terence Crutcher was not belligerent and not aggressive and had his hands up with his back to her when she shot him in Tulsa, Okla. Shelby is now back patrolling the streets as a law enforcement officer. So is Daniel Pantaleo, the man whose arms just happened to be wrapped around Eric Garner\u2019s throat in a loving caress when Garner died on a New York City sidewalk.\n\nI haven\u2019t heard any white outrage about the potential of someone becoming a victim of those two not-convicted killers, but I\u2019m sure white people are equally concerned. I probably missed it because I was still giddy from dancing at the secret, black O.J. victory party. Pantaleo and Shelby are still paid to carry guns and \u201cuphold the law.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut O.J., though.\n\nI recognize that my change of heart may be long overdue, but you know what they say: Better late than never. (Actually, I don\u2019t know if \u201cthey\u201d really say that, but I hope the teller says it with a smile on that glorious day when I\u2019m at the bank filling out the slip to deposit my reparations check.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause I now identify with your outrage after watching a murderer hypothetically confess to a theoretical crime for which he will never be punished. When I see you at the Black Lives Matter march the next time a police officer murders an innocent person of color and gets away with it, I will be sure to apologize to your face. Or maybe I\u2019ll do it when I see you applauding NFL players who are kneeling in hopes that it will bring attention to the kinds of injustice that you are surprisingly so upset about.\n\nAfter all, if you\u2019re mad at O.J., you should be mad at anyone who kills an innocent, unarmed, defenseless human being and gets away with it. If Fox News viewers are incensed about O.J., then the only way they couldn\u2019t be equally infuriated about the disproportionate killing of innocent black people by obviously guilty police officers is if they were racist. But they are not, because all lives matter ...\n\nHypothetically.", "keywords": ["right", "america", "white", "innocent", "simpson", "hypothetical", "confession", "sure", "away", "realize", "oj", "black", "man", "watching", "shelby", "wrong"], "polarity": 0.040153122455102656, "subjectivity": 0.48566481648164816},

For me, it\u2019s been horrifying and embarrassing because people will think I\u2019m collectively contributing to it or sitting by passively.\u201d Norman was a member of the editorial board until December 2016, but was still listed with it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe editorial in question, which ran Monday in the Post-Gazette, was written by a staff member at the Toledo Blade, which shares John Robinson Block as publisher.\n\nIt began, \u201cCalling someone a racist is the new McCarthyism. The charge is pernicious. The accuser doesn\u2019t need to prove it. It simply hangs over the accused like a great human stain.\n\n\u201cIt has become not a descriptive term for a person who believes in the superiority of one race over another, but a term of malice and libel \u2014 almost beyond refutation, as the words \u2018communist\u2019 or \u2018communist sympathizer\u2019 were in the 1950s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMoreover, the accuser somehow covers himself in an immunity of superiority. If I call you a racist, I probably will not be called one. And, finally, having chosen the ultimate epithet, I have dodged the obligation to converse or build.\n\n\u201cIf Donald Trump is called a racist for saying some nations are \u2018shithole countries,\u2019 does that help pass a \u2018Dreamers\u2019 bill to keep gifted young people in this nation \u2014 people who have something to give the United States and are undocumented only because they were brought here by their parents illegally?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the goal, is it not?

That is unfortunate because an independent, responsible press is charged with lifting every voice,\u201d it said in a statement.\n\n\u201cJournalists with the Pittsburgh Black Media Federation have traveled to Haiti, African nations, and other parts of the African diaspora to find and report stories that take readers and viewers beyond the stereotype of who the people are in these countries.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt saddens us to know that the American president\u2019s coarse language and thoughts contribute to the bias \u2014 and that the Post-Gazette editorial attempts to give cover to this racism. . . .\u201d\n\nIn addition to those protests, \u201cA letter was also sent to the P-G by several former employees who said the editorial did not represent the \u2018Post-Gazette we knew,\u2019 \u201c according to Charlie Deitch, writing Wednesday in the Pittsburgh City Paper. \u201cIn addition, current P-G writer and former CP editor Chris Potter . . . has removed his byline from his stories in protest. . . .\u201d\n\nThe story was headlined, \u201cIn 2013, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette publisher John Robinson Block said people of color needed to pull themselves up \u2018by their bootstraps,\u2019 according to one of his own papers. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoreover, according to David Uberti, writing for splinternews.com, \u201cThe Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh, which represents about 150 employees in the Post-Gazette newsroom, begged to differ in a letter submitted to the editor.

The platforms where so many people now share their views, like LinkedIn, Medium and others, were far in the future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cLooking back, it\u2019s difficult to find a notable personality who hasn\u2019t blogged on HuffPost at some point or another. Presidential candidate Barack Obama used HuffPost to address the controversy around his pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright. Jennifer Aniston broke the internet by taking on body-shamers.

Everywhere,\u2019 the president responded.\n\n\u201c \u2018Just Caucasian or white countries, sir? Or do you want people from other parts of the world? Where there are people of color,\u2019 Acosta pushed.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump says, \u2018out,\u2019 pointing away.\u201d\n\nOn a panel on press freedom under Trump at the Newseum on Wednesday, Acosta said of Trump\u2019s showing him the door, \u201cI consider that a badge of honor.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe panel, held in conjunction with the Committee to Protect Journalists, was assembled to discuss the state of press freedom in the United States. The panelists were Acosta, Melinda Henneberger, editorial writer and columnist, Kansas City Star; John Roberts, chief White House correspondent, Fox News Channel; and April Ryan, White House correspondent, American Urban Radio Networks. Gene Policinski, COO and newly named president of the Newseum Institute, moderated.\n\nThe journalists said they had never seen the news media so attacked as under Donald J. Trump, first as candidate, then as president. They called that dangerous for the republic; expressed alarm that the president\u2019s attacks had made inroads with the general public; and warned that the First Amendment was under assault.\n\nToo much of society no longer understands the role of journalists, seeing reporters as partisans with an \u201cagenda\u201d for one side or the other, they said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Cuban-born Acosta recalled seeing T-shirts during Trump rallies advocating the lynching of journalists. \u201cThat is un-American,\u201d Acosta said, raising the specter that, as in other countries, journalists could be killed for doing their jobs.\n\n\u201cThe day we see that [a dead journalist] on the side of a road is the day that we have become something less than the United States of America,\u201d the correspondent said. He and Ryan said they have received death threats.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs if to further stir the pot, Trump released his long-promised \u201cFake News Awards,\u201d honoring \u201cthe most corrupt & biased of the Mainstream Media,\u201d as he phrased it on Twitter. The tweet came as the panel proceeded, prompting the journalists to check their smartphones as they spoke.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump \u2014 who gleefully questioned President Barack Obama\u2019s birthplace for years without evidence, long insisted on the guilt of the Central Park Five despite exonerating proof and claimed that millions of illegal ballots cost him the popular vote in 2016 \u2014 wanted to have a word with the American public about accuracy in reporting,\u201d Matt Flegenheimer and Michael M. Grynbaum wrote for the New York Times.\n\n\u201cWhy is he doing this now?\u201d Ryan asked from the panel, noting the more pressing issues of a prospective nuclear confrontation with North Korea and negotiations to avert an imminent shutdown of the federal government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a joke.\u201d Ryan also said, \u201cIt\u2019s ugly and it\u2019s just going to the lowest levels of who we are as a society.\u201d\n\nAcosta, who had labeled the president\u2019s treatment of reporters \u201cunpresidential,\u201d responded to the naming of CNN as one of the \u201cFake News Awards\u201d winners.\n\nAcosta recounted the deployment of CNN correspondents around the globe, often risking their lives in war zones, and declared, \u201cIt\u2019s an insult to every journalist around the world to even be handing out Fake News Awards. . . .The President is the king of fake news,\u201d Acosta said, citing Trump\u2019s birther history, his labeling of Mexicans as rapists and criminals, his claim that millions of ballots were cast illegally in November 2016 and his declaration that the crowds at his inauguration were the largest ever.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAcosta also asked when the White House had ever acknowledged a mistake, as media outlets have.\n\n\u2018Mr. President, are you a racist?\u2019 Trump dodges questions after \u2018s\u2014-hole\u2019 comments from CNBC.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump\u2019s racial remarks provided sparks for some of the latest confrontations between the president and the Fourth Estate. On Friday, following up on Trump\u2019s statement behind closed doors that Haiti, El Salvador and Africa were \u201cshithole\u201d places and that the United States should look to countries such as Norway for immigrants, Ryan asked the president if he was a racist.\n\nTrump ignored the question, but Ryan said she had to endure blowback from a member of a contingent of black ministers and other African American leaders present for Trump\u2019s signing of a proclamation hailing Jan. 15 as Martin Luther King Day.\n\n\u201cHere come the vultures,\u201d someone said as the press entered the Roosevelt Room Another pointed a water bottle at Ryan disapprovingly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018This is about the First Amendment,\u2019 \u201c Ryan said she told the man. While Trump has a right not to answer her question, she has an obligation to ask it. Ryan conceded, \u201cIt\u2019s a sad day when you have to ask a sitting president, \u2018Are you a racist?\u2019 \u201c\n\nAcosta followed up on Ryan\u2019s question Monday. After being ordered \u201cout\u201d by Trump, \u201cWe then went to the Roosevelt Room where WH aides obstructed us from asking questions,\u201d Acosta tweeted.\n\nThis anti-press attitude filters down to Trump\u2019s supporters, according to the panelists. Henneberger said she gets \u201ca lot of vitriol, a lot of anger\u201d in Middle America. \u201cThey want to tell me how I\u2019m a threat to America. . . . They like the way listening to him makes them feel. They like the entertainment value, the spectacle. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPart of the problem, she said, is \u201cthe public\u2019s lack of understanding about what our role is.\u201d Fox News labels Acosta a \u201cleading Trump critic,\u201d for example, rather than a reporter. Trump\u2019s followers will only regret it were Trump to achieve his goal of weakening the press, Henneberger said. \u201cThere will be a golden age of corruption.\u201d\n\nRoberts, originally from Canada, said that in the United States, \u201cpolitics has become a zero-sum game. I win because you lose. It\u2019s the politics of polarization.\u201d It is also contrary to the character of the United States that attracted him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRyan called for more education in grade schools about the Constitution and the First Amendment.\n\nHenneberger urged members of the public to support journalism by subscribing to their local newspapers in print or online.\n\nAcosta said he wished news organizations would stand together when the rights of one are denied, as has been the case with Acosta at the White House.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwo politicians spoke up on the free-press issue this week. Writing Tuesday in the Washington Post. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., warned, \u201cThe phrase \u2018fake news\u2019 \u2014 granted legitimacy by an American president \u2014 is being used by autocrats to silence reporters, undermine political opponents, stave off media scrutiny and mislead citizens.

His numbers have actually doubled,\u2019 Brian Kilmeade, a \u2018Fox & Friends\u2019 host, said during the segment that was broadcast Tuesday morning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMr. Kilmeade was almost certainly referring to a distorted finding from SurveyMonkey, an online polling company. Since Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration, the company has conducted 602,134 interviews with adults of every race group \u2014 not just \u2018black America,\u2019 as Mr. Kilmeade said.\n\n\u201cSurveyMonkey\u2019s results, provided to The New York Times, show that Mr. Trump\u2019s approval ratings among black Americans actually declined from 20 percent in February 2017, his first full month in office, to 15 percent in December.

However, the report appears to rely on a dataset that has been carefully selected to support the Trump administration\u2019s anti-Muslim policies. . . .\u201d\n\nEl Salvador\u2019s Mass Graves: S\u2014holes Made-in-U.S.A.\n\n\u201cMy journalist\u2019s hiking boots still have leftover feces and dirt from the ultimate shitholes of El Salvador: its mass graves,\u201d Roberto Lovato, a writer and journalist based at the San Francisco Writers\u2019 Grotto, wrote Friday for Latino Rebels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMany of the thousands of graves that my sources there have mapped were dug by U.S.-trained and funded security forces in the 80s. Most of the rest were dug more recently by [L.A.-based] gangs steadily deported to El Salvador by U.S. immigration authorities since the 90s.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s characterization of Africa, Haiti and El Salvador as \u2018shitholes\u2019 disturbed me, but I wasn\u2019t sure why. The comments were made during a discussion about the temporary protected status for hundreds of thousands of Salvadoran, Haitian and other immigrants Trump had just rescinded.\n\n\u201cIn search for an answer, I went home and pulled out and studied my boots, which were tattered after too many visits to mass graves, mass graves with the remains of Salvadorans \u2014 in El Salvador, in Mexico and in the deserts of south Texas. Wearing my hiking boots during visits to numerous sites along this chain of devalued life led me to the conclusion that mass graves were the ultimate shitholes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat made me most uncomfortable was less about Mr. Trump\u2019s choice of word than how he used it: he mistook the shithole part for the whole country. Trump\u2019s rhetorical fallacy feels like a cover-up, a distraction from the fact that El Salvador\u2019s mass graves contain fingerprints and other evidence that point to the United States as an accomplice to the mass murder and violence that created them. Viewed from this perspective, Trump\u2019s \u2018shithole\u2019 comment said in words what all US presidents have said with their policies towards countries like Haiti and El Salvador. . . .\u201d\n\nNo Discipline for Suburban Chicago Cops Who Shoot\n\n\u201cSince 2005, there have been at least 113 police shootings in suburban Cook County,\u201d Ill., according to \u201cTaking Cover: How Cops Escape Discipline for Shootings in Suburban Chicago,\u201d a joint project of the Better Government Association and WBEZ-FM released this month.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNot a single officer involved in those shootings was disciplined, fired or charged criminally, a year-long investigation by the Better Government Association and WBEZ found. What\u2019s more, almost none of those shootings [was] even reviewed for misconduct.\n\n\u201cWhile Chicago has come under scrutiny for its controversial police shootings, a process is in place to examine them for policy violations. That doesn\u2019t exist in Cook County suburbs, where police shot unarmed suspects, innocent bystanders and even each other. . . . \u201c\n\nCommenting on the series, the Chicago Sun-Times editorialized Tuesday, \u201cThe Illinois Legislature should require an independent review by an outside agency whenever there is a police-involved shooting in a suburb, an inquiry that goes beyond the question of whether the shooting was criminal. The state, perhaps acting through the Illinois Law Enforcement Training & Standards Board, also should draw up rules governing the use of force that would apply to police statewide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn some instances when a police officer pulls out a gun, there might have been a way to defuse a situation instead.

The rules would have required the program to inform graduates of their poor outcomes, and would eventually have prohibited students from taking out loans to attend.\ufeff\n\n\n\nDeVos halted enforcement of the gainful employment rule, effectively allowing schools to avoid disclosing this information. The Department of Education is currently working on rewriting the rule entirely.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe suit, filed Tuesday by 17 states and the District of Columbia, alleges that DeVos is breaking the law by refusing to enforce the gainful employment rule, which has been upheld multiple times by federal courts after for-profit institutions challenged the regulation.\n\nThe lawsuit is being led by Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh. The AG told the Washington Post yesterday that it was \u201coutrageous for the DOE to say they\u2019re going to allow these predatory institutions to continue to take advantage of people who are vulnerable, people with very few resources.\u201d\n\nMany education advocates suspected DeVos would champion the interests of for-profit colleges, and they\u2019ve yet to be proven wrong. In September, DeVos had the gall to appoint one of DeVry University\u2019s former deans to run an anti-fraud unit in the Department of Education. In 2016, DeVry agreed to a $100 million settlement with the Federal Trade Commission because of years of cooking their graduates\u2019 employment stats (As Slate reported, DeVry counted grads serving food at the Cheesecake Factory as working \u201cin their field\u201d).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s pretty much like asking Harvey Weinstein to run a sexual harassment task force.\n\nUnless the courts intervene, DeVos will continue to leave graduates vulnerable to fraud. The same attorneys general who filed Tuesday\u2019s suit are also suing DeVos over her refusal to enforce the borrower defense rule\u2014another Obama-era regulation.\n\nThat rule sets up a process that allows students who claim they were defrauded by for-profit institutions to apply for loan forgiveness. According to BuzzFeed, not only did DeVos tell a group of Republican leaders that the rule offered \u201cfree money\u201d to any student that \u201craised his or her hands\u201d\u2014the DOE has yet to approve a single claim by a defrauded student.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike the Cheeto-dusted dotard that put her in charge, DeVos\u2019 has attacked Obama-era protections with the single-mindedness of a wrecking ball. If she succeeds in undoing the regulations, it will have a disproportionate impact on black graduates.\n\nBlack grads incur much higher student loan debt than their non-black peers, and data shows that predatory for-profit institutions are largely to blame.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA study reported by the Atlantic found that black graduates have nearly double the loan debt of white grads four years after graduation\u2014despite having similar amounts of debt at the moment they receive their diplomas.\n\nWhile factors like employment discrimination and defaults are partially to blame, researchers found that graduate school discrepancies contributed the most to that yawning debt gap. Not only were black grads more likely to continue their studies, 28% of them enrolled in a for-profit school, while less than 10% of white grads did so.", "keywords": ["students", "grads", "institutions", "states", "sue", "loan", "forprofit", "protections", "graduates", "refusing", "debt", "obamaera", "devos", "employment", "student", "borrowers", "rule", "enforce"], "polarity": 0.00971230158730159, "subjectivity": 0.44422619047619044},

He sent them down the runway with opera-length black gloves and black Off-White x Nike sneakers. It\u2019s the perfect uniform for young girls on the club-crawl circuit, paired with small sunglasses in cat-eye shapes, stiff scarves tied like ribbons at the back of the neck and structured top-handled bags.\n\nThe bags\u2014with the word \u201cSculpture,\u201d the date and Abloh\u2019s name printed in block letters\u2014will no doubt go viral on the knockoff market, soon to become a global fast-fashion hit on the worldwide dance floor.

But perhaps CoverGirl\u2019s latest ad, featuring model Amy Deanna, who has vitiligo, is the cosmetic company\u2019s freshest yet. In it, CoverGirl takes an unconventional turn by not trying to cover up Deanna\u2019s skin but, rather, enhancing its uniqueness.\n\nIn the 15-second spot, Deanna applies two shades of CoverGirl\u2019s truBlend foundation to match her contrasting skin tones. Choosing to cover some spots while matching others, she asks, \u201cWhy try to blend in when you can choose to stand out?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a refreshing take on a condition that reportedly affects about 1-2 percent of the population and has only in recent years begun to receive positive attention. In 2014, Canadian model Winnie Harlow was the first contestant with vitiligo to be featured on America\u2019s Next Top Model, in the show\u2019s 21st cycle. Harlow has since become a regular on the the fashion circuit, but only after years of bullying led to her dropping out of high school and contemplating suicide.\n\nCoverGirl isn\u2019t the first cosmetics brand to include a model with vitiligo; Dermablend also includes models with the condition in its tutorials, most notably in the 2014 \u201cCamo Confessions\u201d campaign. But truBlend is perhaps the first foundation line to keep the emphasis on enhancing the beauty that\u2019s already there, rather than covering up to conform.

No one would be more in tune with how they\u2019re feeling, what feels a little off, what a certain type of discomfort and/or pain means, and what might need a certain test.\n\nBut it still took relentless requests for Williams\u2019 doctors and nurses to believe that she needed to be tested for blood clots and not just have her discomfort dismissed as a side effect from her pain medication. This, despite the fact that she has a history of clotting issues and literally almost died from it in 2003. And again, this is Serena fucking Williams.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, we don\u2019t know if Wiliams\u2019 doctors would have been more likely to believe her if she were a world-class athlete who also happened to be white. Or if she just happened to be an upper-class woman who also happened to be white. Or if she just happened to be white. Again, we don\u2019t know this.\n\nBut the distance here between what we know for certain and what I feel is minute. I feel like her doctors believed that they gave her the best treatment they could possibly provide. I feel like they definitely weren\u2019t actively thinking that since she\u2019s a black woman, they should be more skeptical about and dismissive of her pain.\n\n\n\nBut I know that black women receive different treatment for cancer than white women do. And that black women just generally receive poorer health care than white people and men do. And that black patients are more likely to have their pain dismissed by doctors and nurses, which subsequently means they\u2019re less likely to receive pain medication.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd that in America today exist monuments to James Marion Sims, a man known as the father of modern gynecology. And that Sims\u2019 medical advances were due to black female slaves, whom he experimented on without anesthesia because he either believed they didn\u2019t experience pain or just didn\u2019t give a shit about the pain they experienced. And that, just so you don\u2019t dismiss this as a relic from the past, in 2016 a study revealed that medical students still believed that blacks and whites experience pain differently.\n\nAnd with all of that knowledge, I feel like Williams\u2019 doctors may have subconsciously internalized those beliefs. And I feel like they may have been less likely to give her the benefit of the doubt without even realizing it. And these feelings remind me of how I feel about my mom.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy mom\u2019s birthday is in a couple weeks. She would have been 65 years old. On her birthday I will call my dad and my sister, as I\u2019ve done with each of my mom\u2019s birthdays since she died in 2013, and maybe we\u2019ll talk about her. And maybe we won\u2019t. Maybe we\u2019ll just talk about my daughter or maybe my sister\u2019s grandkids or maybe Antonio Brown.\n\nIf the weather is nice, maybe we\u2019ll all drive out to her grave in Monroeville, Pa. And we\u2019ll stand around her plot, silently, not quite sure what\u2019s supposed to be done or said when you\u2019re standing over your mom\u2019s (or your wife\u2019s) long-dead body. We\u2019ll place flowers on her grave and perhaps pray together. And then we\u2019ll get back in our cars and drive back home.\n\nShe died in October of 2013 after a \u201cyearlong\u201d battle with lung cancer. \u201cYearlong\u201d is in quotation marks because while she was diagnosed in October of 2012, I believe that she was battling for longer than a year. I believe that if the doctors had taken her more seriously and had treated the paralyzing back and chest pain she\u2019d been suffering through since 2011 with whatever it is that doctors do to test for lung cancer instead of the Advil and Percocet and steroid injections they recommended she take, maybe it would have been found sooner.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd maybe, if it was found sooner, they would have had a better chance of treating it. And maybe if she was an upper-class white woman instead of a working-class black woman who\u2019d just lost her house to foreclosure, she would have received different treatment. Maybe they would have found it sooner. Maybe she\u2019d still be alive. Maybe she still would have died, but maybe they would have discovered a way to manage her pain sooner so that her life wouldn\u2019t have been as excruciating.\n\nOf course, I don\u2019t know if any of these things are true. And to be fair, the nurses and doctors who cared for my mom treated her with kindness and attentiveness. But I know that they were susceptible to the same pervasive and subconscious biases that led to those racial disparities in health care\u2014because we all are. And I feel\u2014I believe\u2014that they were affected by them, and this affected how my mom was treated.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat said, I can\u2019t prove any of this. It\u2019s just a feeling. And just a feeling ain\u2019t enough.\n\nUnless, of course, you\u2019re white.", "keywords": ["listened", "feel", "happened", "saved", "know", "wasnt", "white", "pain", "serena", "mom", "life", "doctors", "woman", "likely", "maybe", "finally", "black", "williams", "lucky"], "polarity": 0.06641649413388544, "subjectivity": 0.44138486312399366},

A black woman who lived and fought with intention, creating resources from nothing, walking through doors without knocking when others felt she should.

It gave us the courage to speak openly, laugh loudly and cry softly.\n\nOne spring morning, thousands of us sat on the quad and on White Hall Chapel stairs and stood on the Ave. (our regular meeting places before parties, after panty raids and just before 11 p.m. freshman curfews) in our sweat- and makeup-stained white tees and hoodies, tears flooding our mouths and our screams breaking city sound regulations, holding one another after tragically losing one of our own in a car accident. We became family. Not only because we wore \u201cWildcat\u201d as a badge of honor, but because we\u2019d gone through hell together, that morning and hundreds of other mornings, and held tight one another through the fear.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMary said, \u201cIf we accept and acquiesce in the face of discrimination, we accept the responsibility ourselves. We should, therefore, protest openly everything ... that smacks of discrimination or slander.\u201d With those words, on May 10, 2017, my family shut down U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos.

Averaging around 600,000 views per post, her funny and frank videos, like \u201cBougie and Bad on a Budget\u201d and \u201cEdges Slaughtered,\u201d bring the real on the makeup tip, touching on issues of race and money in ways that make viewers laugh as much as they learn.\n\nThe Glow Up caught up with Aina a few days after she made history as the first social media star to receive the coveted NAACP Image Award. She told us:\n\nTen years ago, when I started my YouTube channel, it was hard for me to find darker-skinned black women that did makeup the way I like to. I was used to hearing that things \u201cdon\u2019t look good on you\u201d or \u201cyou can\u2019t wear that kind of makeup.\u201d I struggled with being a woman who\u2014people see you with makeup on and dressed nicely, people assume \u201cshe doesn\u2019t work very hard because she doesn\u2019t have to\u201d; [it] made being taken seriously a struggle.\n\nObviously, as a member of the U.S. Army Reserve, Aina is no stranger to hard work. She said that \u201cwomen who enjoy makeup and feeling good, there\u2019s often a lot more to it,\u201d citing the example of women recovering from cancer learning to put their eyebrows back on, or women in uniform, like herself, who want to assert their individuality.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a double minority as a black woman, so I fight through a lot in that regard,\u201d she said. As a woman in the military, \u201cpeople think we\u2019re tomboys or slobs; they say, \u2018You\u2019re too pretty; how could you be in the Army? Whatever that means.\u201d\n\nDuring our conversation, the question Aina seemed to be wrestling with is why women\u2019s motives and values are in question when they want to be at their most presentable: \u201cThe message I want to get across is that whether you want to wear makeup or not, it\u2019s OK to go the extra mile to look your best.\u201d Passion mounted in her voice as she said that she never wants stereotypes about women in uniform \u201cto overshadow the fact that some of us are artistic and creative; we are multifaceted\u2014wearing lipstick and lashes doesn\u2019t make us any less hard workers.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Aina, being beautifully turned out represents \u201cbeing knowledgeable; people come to me for help, and I know I\u2019m good at it.\u201d She pointed to prejudices surrounding beauty, like the now defunct \u201cTake Her Swimming on the First Date\u201d memes, where men were urged to take their date for a dip in order to remove the mask of makeup and discover how truly attractive or unattractive she really is. Aina said:\n\nI don\u2019t think people realize that women genuinely enjoy it. I can go all up and down Instagram and see women with murals literally painted on their faces. Obviously, it\u2019s not ideal for work, but it\u2019s about the fact that we\u2019ve gone way beyond thinking of makeup as a way to hide or to cover up. It\u2019s a form of expression for not only me but a lot of people.\n\nBeing a black person pioneering in any business\u2014Aina has been a vlogger for more than a decade now\u2014has its perks. If you\u2019re good, being first to market can mean not only capturing market share but also defining the category, as she has done. But outliers like Aina also face challenges. In a post called \u201cI Don\u2019t See Color,\u201d she explores questions of race through the lens of the beauty business. She tells us:\n\nI\u2019m not ... just a black beauty blogger. I have dark skin and that shapes my experiences. Being that I\u2019m an African blogger who considers herself Nigerian first\u2014my mother is African American and my dad is Nigerian\u2014I never kind of feel African enough or Nigerian enough. I never know where I kind of fit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s a struggle that most blacks in this country feel on some level every day: that our black cards could be revoked by anyone for not achieving the impossible task of representing the entire black experience as just one person. Aina said:\n\nOne thing that I\u2019ve brought a lot of attention to on my YouTube channel, if you are racially ambiguous\u2014like you skew Asian\u2014it can be a lot easier.

Today I am here to admit to white America that I was totally wrong about Orenthal James Simpson. (I know using \u201cwhite\u201d as an adjective to describe \u201cAmerica\u201d is redundant, but I just want to make sure I acknowledge the Caucasians who \u201cbuilt this country\u201d because\u2014aside from history books, movies, television, literature, the national narrative and Donald Trump rallies\u2014you rarely receive the credit you are due. Big ups to you.)\n\nOn Sunday night, Fox News reignited the ire of white people who are still dumbstruck that a man could get away with an obvious murder when the decidedly unfair and mentally imbalanced network aired a decade-old interview of O.J. Simpson appearing to confess, in which he laid out how he might have, theoretically, murdered his ex-wife Nicole Brown and her friend Ron Goldman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhite America, I am now on your side. I couldn\u2019t have been more wrong. You were right all along.\n\nWhite people hate O.J. For them, he is evil incarnate. After all, if a black man could get away with killing a white woman in a wealthy neighborhood, how could anyone feel safe?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can\u2019t fathom how black-hearted I must have seemed back in 1995 when I applauded the O.J. verdict. I now realize how upset you guys must have felt to see a cold-blooded killer like O.J. get set free. Well, actually, I forgot that I felt those same emotions after the George Zimmerman acquittal.\n\nAnd the Betty Shelby trial.\n\nAnd the Philando Castile decision.\n\nAnd the decision not to indict Darren Wilson for the shooting death of Michael Brown Jr.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd the acquittal of Jeronimo Yanez.\n\nOK, I also now realize that saying \u201cI now realize\u201d was probably a bad choice of words.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: I always believed O.J. did that shit.\n\n\n\nWhen black people celebrated the O.J. acquittal in 1995, it was not because we thought he was a symbol of innocence and purity who was preparing to buy NBC. It was because the O.J. case exposed the bigotry that permeates the entire justice system in America and how\u2014despite his celebrity, wealth and resources\u2014a black man could be deemed guilty simply from an outpouring of alabaster outrage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe believed that he was a murderer and we believed the Los Angeles Police Department tried to frame him by tampering with evidence. Both things were probably true. Given black people\u2019s relationship with cops, the then-recent Rodney King verdict, the criminal-justice system and the legacy of black men who were lynched for breathing in the direction of white women, I\u2019m sure you could understand why we celebrated the O.J. verdict. We weren\u2019t on O.J.\u2019s team. We were Team JohnnyCochran. We were #TeamFuckTheLAPD.\n\nThis Lying, Murdering Whore Called America Today\u2014almost a year after a man who took an oath to protect and serve sent a bullet into the skull\u2026 Read more Read\n\nBut before Fox\u2019s O.J. special, I had never seen someone give a detailed explanation of how they murdered an innocent human being with a straight face and showing no remorse. To be fair, I missed George Zimmerman\u2019s interview on Hannity. I also forgot to DVR his appearance on CNN. Oh, and that Daily Beast article where he said that Trayvon Martin\u2019s parents \u201cdidn\u2019t raise him right\u201d and treated him \u201clike a dog without a leash\u201d\u2014I never got around to reading it. So this was my first time witnessing something like this.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut now that O.J. has hypothetically confessed on national television, I understand how you feel that our system shouldn\u2019t let an unrepentant killer walk around white women all willy-nilly. He may have been found not guilty in a court of law, but that doesn\u2019t mean he is innocent. What if he\u2019s triggered by a different pair of thin upper lips or oblate buttocks and goes on another killing spree? We just watched him confess!\n\nI felt the same way about Betty Shelby, who admitted on 60 Minutes that Terence Crutcher was not belligerent and not aggressive and had his hands up with his back to her when she shot him in Tulsa, Okla. Shelby is now back patrolling the streets as a law enforcement officer. So is Daniel Pantaleo, the man whose arms just happened to be wrapped around Eric Garner\u2019s throat in a loving caress when Garner died on a New York City sidewalk.\n\nI haven\u2019t heard any white outrage about the potential of someone becoming a victim of those two not-convicted killers, but I\u2019m sure white people are equally concerned. I probably missed it because I was still giddy from dancing at the secret, black O.J. victory party. Pantaleo and Shelby are still paid to carry guns and \u201cuphold the law.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut O.J., though.\n\nI recognize that my change of heart may be long overdue, but you know what they say: Better late than never. (Actually, I don\u2019t know if \u201cthey\u201d really say that, but I hope the teller says it with a smile on that glorious day when I\u2019m at the bank filling out the slip to deposit my reparations check.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause I now identify with your outrage after watching a murderer hypothetically confess to a theoretical crime for which he will never be punished. When I see you at the Black Lives Matter march the next time a police officer murders an innocent person of color and gets away with it, I will be sure to apologize to your face. Or maybe I\u2019ll do it when I see you applauding NFL players who are kneeling in hopes that it will bring attention to the kinds of injustice that you are surprisingly so upset about.\n\nAfter all, if you\u2019re mad at O.J., you should be mad at anyone who kills an innocent, unarmed, defenseless human being and gets away with it. If Fox News viewers are incensed about O.J., then the only way they couldn\u2019t be equally infuriated about the disproportionate killing of innocent black people by obviously guilty police officers is if they were racist. But they are not, because all lives matter ...\n\nHypothetically.", "keywords": ["right", "america", "white", "innocent", "simpson", "hypothetical", "confession", "sure", "away", "realize", "oj", "black", "man", "watching", "shelby", "wrong"], "polarity": 0.040153122455102656, "subjectivity": 0.48566481648164816},

For me, that word defines Serena Williams. I love her body\u2014it\u2019s invincible. I also love that none of her seemingly superhuman attributes were given to her or easily attained. Everything she has, she earned, one drop of sweat at a time. She and big sister Venus were their own mini-civil-rights movement as they fought to establish their place on the predominantly white tennis circuit, and they have dominated for nearly two decades.\n\nBecoming the mother to gorgeous baby girl Alexis Olympia\u2014who shares her February cover of Vogue magazine\u2014was no less a struggle than any of Williams\u2019 other feats; she came straight out of Compton, Calif., to be crowned the Best Athlete of All Time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs told to Vogue, Williams\u2014newly married to Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian\u2014was blessed with an easy pregnancy (as expected, given her supreme physical condition). But delivering the other cover girl on this month\u2019s Vogue was ultimately a \u201charrowing experience.\u201d Call it bad luck, but as her baby\u2019s heart rate plummeted dangerously low during birth, Williams required an emergency cesarean section.\n\nTo make matters worse, the new mother suffered a recurrence of blood clots\u2014a condition that flared up hours after the C-section that left Williams gasping for air and fearing that she was having another pulmonary embolism. After she advocated for herself and insisted on a CT scan and a blood thinner, another emergency surgery was performed to insert a filter into a major vein to clear up abdominal bleeding (a side effect of blood-thinning medication). To add to the drama, her C-section incision then ruptured because of the intense coughing caused by the blood clot. Our mighty Serena was left flat on her back for a full six weeks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThankfully, mother and daughter are now more than fine. Serena is up and naturally winning again, with a new clothing line launching on her website in March, serial investments in tech companies owned or led by black women, and a new home in Silicon Valley.\n\nIs she done with tennis? Not by a long shot. Twenty-three grand slams already have her name on them, and she\u2019s looking to own 25 in total, making her the greatest tennis player of all time (24 is the current record held by Australian Margaret Court).\n\nAs for motherhood, Williams only believes it ups her game, telling Vogue:\n\nKnowing I\u2019ve got this beautiful baby to go home to makes me feel like I don\u2019t have to play another match. I don\u2019t need the money or the titles or the prestige. I want them, but I don\u2019t need them. That\u2019s a different feeling for me ... It\u2019s interesting. ... There hasn\u2019t been a clear number one since I was there. It will be cool to see if I get there again, to what I call my spot\u2014where I feel I belong. I don\u2019t play to be the second best or the third best. If there\u2019s no clear number one, it\u2019s like, yeah, I can get my spot back.

DeVos said that the Obama administration helped elevate the issue of sexual assault and issued guidance with good intentions, but good intentions alone are not enough.\n\n(What?)\n\nAccording to The Hill, DeVos said that the Obama policies have failed too many survivors and that \u201cvictims\u201d of false accusations lack due process on campuses. She said that a school that fails to take a report of sexual assault seriously commits discrimination.\n\nShe also said that a school with a system biased toward finding someone guilty of sexual assault is also guilty of discrimination.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(Let that sink in, because that\u2019s deep.)\n\n\u201cThe rights of one person can never be paramount to the rights of another,\u201d DeVos said.\n\nAs part of the process for making these changes, DeVos said that the Department of Education will issue a public notice and have a comment period so that the public can provide input on better ways to enforce Title IX sex discrimination laws and create an effective system that protects the rights of all students.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, to be fair, until we actually see the changes she wants to make, we don\u2019t know what policies DeVos is planning to put into place.

Putting policies in place that seemingly criminalize the act of reporting sexual assault will serve only as a deterrent for victims who actually need justice but will be afraid to seek it. This is unreal.\n\nI agree that if someone makes a false accusation, there should be punishment. I believe this because people who make false accusations make it harder for real victims to be believed.

Creating new systems for dealing with false accusations is a good remedy, and that should be the route this process takes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCreating a system that makes victims hesitant to report the crimes against them is, in and of itself, a crime.

Wearing traditional head wraps, cloaked in clouds of Marabou feathers fresh off the couture runway of Saint Laurent, the two wonderful women\u2014both of whom I\u2019m lucky enough to call friends\u2014epitomize regal beauty.\n\n\n\nIman\u2014well, she\u2019s Iman. What more needs to be said? \u201cBaby Girl Imaan,\u201d as I call her; she\u2019s the model of the moment. She has already appeared on multiple Vogue covers and is slaying it one sexy step at a time on every designer runway from New York to Tokyo.\n\nIn his monthly letter, Vogue Arabia Editor-in-Chief Manuel Arnaut writes of his choice of this iconic issue\u2019s cover girls:\n\nI truly believe that a cover should also encapsulate a message of hope and go above and beyond just a pretty image. This is exactly what we tried to achieve when we invited two of the biggest models with strong ties to the Arab world to be our March cover stars.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRight now, fashion-philes are hoofing it all over the globe to get their hands on one of the special-edition issues, where Iman shares her thoughts on her lifelong career in fashion, from being discovered as a model in 1975 to her fight for equal pay as a black model. (It\u2019s a fight black models continue to wage every day; just last week, Naomi Campbell posted on Instagram that she contended with the same issue last December when she shot the Swarovski campaign.)\n\nIman also speaks openly to Vogue about reconciling her religion with her career. She says, \u201cIt is an oxymoron to have your foot in the modeling business and to call yourself a Muslim, but at the end of the day, you need to look in the mirror and feel good when you ask, \u2018Am I doing the right thing?\u2019\u201d\n\nHammam, like every other black model walking the runway and smiling for the camera today, praises Iman for paving the way for all black girls. Hamman tells Vogue that she is also fiercely proud of being at the forefront of the ongoing diversity movement. \u201cFashion is all about having a personality\u2014and nothing is as inspiring as the power of being you,\u201d she says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScreenshot: Patrick Demarchelier (Vogue.me)\n\nThe choice of head wraps for the cover at once inspires pride and curiosity about the history of the head wrap. Nnenna Stella, owner of Brooklyn, N.Y.-based the Wrap Life, created the cover look using a prototype for a forthcoming collection of traditional scarves, which will retail on her website for a reasonable $24-$27.\n\nLanding any cover, let alone a historic and collectible cover like the anniversary issue of Vogue Arabia, was literally the answer to this entrepreneur\u2019s prayers. \u201cI\u2019ve never wrapped that way before,\u201d Stella says of the Nefertiti-esque black-and-white silk-chiffon turbans created for the cover. \u201cMy fingers were just flowing, and that is essentially what I tell my clients to do.\u201d The Wrap Life\u2019s head wraps are 2 yards long and between 22 and 24 inches wide. \u201cA wrap is just a piece of fabric,\u201d she says. \u201cEverything else we wear, like pants, are precut for us so we know how to wear it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIronically, Stella did not grow up wearing head wraps. She tells The Glow Up that when she founded the Wrap Life five years ago, \u201cI was waitressing, and really sad about it; my photography career wasn\u2019t working out.\u201d After 30 days of an ad hoc self-discovery workshop\u2014which, among other things, included keeping a journal marked \u201cWild Things Can Happen\u201d\u2014she wanted to change up her look as part of the spiritual reboot.\n\n\u201cNormally, you\u2019d just get a lipstick or a haircut,\u201d Stella says. But she was looking for that \u201cone extra thing [she] could do.\u201d That extra form of expression turned out to be wearing a head wrap. The look quickly became her signature, and when she couldn\u2019t find head wraps she liked online, it became her business. In her words: \u201cIt\u2019s instantly transformative to have a beautiful piece of fabric on your head.\u201d\n\nScreenshot: Patrick Demarchelier (Vogue.me)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaster makeup artist Porsche Cooper\u2014a favorite of elite photographers; brands like Tiffany and Est\u00e9e Lauder; and stars like supermodel Joan Smalls and singer Andra Day\u2014told The Glow Up:\n\nDiversity and equal representation in the beauty and fashion industries is a hard-fought and necessary cause, so to be a part of pushing the cause and conversation along is a great honor. To have my iconic muse Iman, and new muse Imaan Hammam, on the anniversary Vogue Arabia cover at once is my wildest fantasy come true.

It was unexpected, and it was disrespected. At the time, I promised Northwestern they would never hear from me again.\n\nFour Caucasian sorority girls were elected to Homecoming Court, but not as the queen. One of them cried her little eyes out. When they called my name, the president of the university looked at me, held the crown over my head and said, \u201cI have to stand here while they take pictures,\u201d then turned and walked away.\n\nBackstage, while the court was introduced, one by one, the girls would go out and you would hear applause from the audience.

Jet magazine, Amsterdam News and press from all over the world had gotten hold of the story. My community\u2014the black community\u2014celebrated. I wasn\u2019t in the yearbook as homecoming queen because the administration told me it \u201cwasn\u2019t important.\u201d Forty years later, the Black Alumni Association gave me a Hall of Fame Award.

In the interview, Williams discusses everything from her post-birth health emergency to the emotional ups and downs of motherhood.\n\nShortly after giving birth, Williams complained about having shortness of breath, and with her history of blood clots, she assumed that she was having another pulmonary embolism. When she prompted nurses for a CT scan with contrast and IV heparin (a blood thinner), they didn\u2019t oblige right away:\n\n\u201cI was like, a Doppler? I told you, I need a CT scan and a heparin drip,\u201d she remembers telling the team. The ultrasound revealed nothing, so they sent her for the CT, and sure enough, several small blood clots had settled in her lungs. Minutes later she was on the drip. \u201cI was like, listen to Dr. Williams!\u201d\ufeff\n\nShortly after that incident, another health crisis occurred:\n\nC-section wound popped open from the intense coughing spells caused by the pulmonary embolism, and when she returned to surgery, they found that a large hematoma had flooded her abdomen, the result of a medical catch-22 in which the potentially lifesaving blood thinner caused hemorrhaging at the site of her C-section. She returned yet again to the OR to have a filter inserted into a major vein, in order to prevent more clots from dislodging and traveling into her lungs.\ufeff\n\nA week after giving birth, Williams was sent home, but she was confined to bed rest for six weeks. Although Williams wanted to enjoy being a new mother, she found it hard because of the emotional roller coaster she was riding:\n\n\u201cSometimes I get really down and feel like, Man, I can\u2019t do this,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s that same negative attitude I have on the court sometimes.

The racism and xenophobia that we saw on the University of Virginia campus was born out of America\u2019s historical endorsement of slavery, segregation, discrimination and biased policies. Hundreds marched with tiki torches, chanting \u201cWhite lives matter\u201d on Friday, and a riot ensued the next day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe White House\u2019s reluctance to condemn white supremacy and racism shows just how far we\u2019ve progressed (which is to say, not much). Those who used the #ThisIsNotUs hashtag in the aftermath of the neo-Nazi, \u201calt-right,\u201d Ku Klux Klan march could not be more wrong.\n\nI assume that those who posted it on social media were trying to diminish the hundreds of people who descended on the town as an aberration, and showing solidarity in a careful way with those whom racism harms. All of which is more evidence that schools are clearly failing our students and society at large.\n\nJelani Cobb, the New Yorker columnist, tweeted:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDeVos\u2019 remarks have been much less insightful. She wrote a two-tweet response to the violence that read:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer generic and woefully insufficient statement effectively sanitized the hate that neo-Nazis, Klan members and alt-right demonstrators put on full display as they shouted Nazi slogans such as \u201cSieg heil\u201d and waved Confederate flags while carrying military gear. DeVos, the nation\u2019s top teacher (clearly symbolic), failed the basic test of providing leadership to teachers, education officials and counselors on how to educate students out of bigotry, white supremacy and violence.\n\n\n\nIn an Associated Press story, DeVos said that Washington, D.C. (aka the federal government), has a responsibility to \u201cset a tone.\u201d But what tone did she set? Instead of unequivocally condemning the hateful and divisive ideology that was espoused by the neo-Nazi marchers, DeVos issued two bland tweets in the passive tense that proclaimed her disgust with the behavior and rhetoric that was displayed (by whom? against whom?) and even managed to include a qualification that all Americans should be able to speak their minds.\n\nEffective educators name, describe and identify\u2014no matter how painful it is to look hatred in the face\u2014the conditions that students, teachers and families must face.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDeVos is not ready to lead, and her response proves it anew. From the opening bell of her confirmation hearings to her nonstatement on Charlottesville, DeVos continues to show that she cannot be the education secretary our country deserves and so desperately needs.\n\nIn this way, she mirrors her boss, whose initial statements were criticized by many for being vague and weak, but the public\u2019s outcry backed Trump into revising his statement and delivering a speech on Monday (although it probably should have been given before this planned hate march took place). DeVos, however, has yet to offer a more robust denouncement or any further guidance for teachers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe people who are targeted by hate groups are stepping forward, since DeVos and Trump have failed to step up. Melinda Anderson, who writes for the Atlantic and is a member of the collaborative EduColor, started the hashtag #CharlottesvilleCurriculum, through which teachers and education support groups are providing resources to help teachers at this critical time.\n\n\n\nOne of the best sources of information posting to the hashtag is the nonprofit Teaching Tolerance, which provides free resources to teachers, administrators, counselors and other practitioners. The organization has been helping teachers educate for a diverse democracy for years.\n\nI have to assume that Trump\u2019s and DeVos\u2019 slowness in naming racism reflects either that they don\u2019t know that white supremacy is supported by \u201cfake news\u201d and bigoted, politically driven and unscientific ideologies\u2014or that they believe in them. Neither is acceptable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump and DeVos are failing our students. Charlottesville was their teachable moment, and they failed the test. How we teach in the aftermath of Charlottesville can be a bright footnote in the sordid history of American bigotry or it can be just more of the same.\n\nWe can\u2019t hide the past, but we can educate our way out of it. We just need the right teachers to do it.\n\nThis story was produced by the Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education, in partnership with The Root.\n\n", "keywords": ["domestic", "students", "education", "supremacy", "hate", "teachable", "teachers", "white", "va", "trump", "betsy", "racism", "terrorism", "devos", "moment", "charlottesville", "fails", "recognize"], "polarity": 0.014840404040404032, "subjectivity": 0.42245108225108224},

Specifically, while the fictional world of Wakanda gave us a glimpse at what black civilization might have been like without European colonization, it also represented a world in which the systemic rape that accompanied slavery and colonization\u2014let alone voluntary miscegenation\u2014simply wasn\u2019t a consideration.\n\n\n\nSo it\u2019s a little surprising to learn that at one point, 19-year-old biracial actress Amandla Stenberg was seriously considered for one of the coveted leading roles in the film. While an undeniably talented actress who is no stranger to the genre (Hunger Games, anyone?), Stenberg would never be mistaken for a purely African woman.\n\nBut what\u2019s less surprising is that Stenberg\u2014also a staunch and outspoken young activist who faced racist accusations of miscasting after portraying what many mistakenly presumed to be the blond and blue-eyed character Rue in the first film adaptation of the Hunger Games trilogy\u2014was aware of this as well. At the recent TIFF Next Wave Festival, she recounted the experience in an interview with the Canadian Broadcast Co.:\n\nOne of the most challenging things for me to do was to walk away from Black Panther. I got really, really close and they were like, \u201cDo you want to continue fighting for this?\u2019 And I was like, \u201cThis isn\u2019t right.\u201d These are all dark-skin actors playing Africans and I feel like it would have just been off to see me as a biracial American with a Nigerian accent just pretending that I\u2019m the same color as everyone else in the movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile her admission challenges some of our previous assumptions about how the movie was cast, it\u2019s a moment of self-awareness we rarely see in Hollywood, particularly in the narrow realm of quality roles for black actresses. And while it was no doubt devastating not to participate in one of the most powerful and anticipated black films in history, Stenberg stands by her choice:\n\nThat was really challenging, to make that decision, but I have no regrets. I recognize 100 percent that there are spaces that I should not take up, and when I do take up a space, it\u2019s because I\u2019ve thought really, really critically about it and I\u2019ve consulted people I really trust and it feels right.\n\nFrom her mouth to Zoe Saldana\u2019s ears. It is so refreshing to see an actress less concerned with advancing her own career than with making sure that representation is on point, and we (and, we suspect, Letitia Wright, who brilliantly played Shuri) thank her for her humility and integrity. Colorism is enough of a plague in Hollywood without lighter-skinned actresses co-opting roles that don\u2019t resemble them in the least.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut we deeply appreciate Stenberg\u2019s stance, especially when she is also fully aware of the lack of solid roles available to her. In the interview, she speaks about being forced to take time to choose wisely after her breakthrough role at age 12. But she trusted then\u2014as she clearly does now\u2014that her discernment and patience would lead her exactly where she needs to be:\n\nI still am really young and it\u2019s not a race. I didn\u2019t feel like I had to be working all the time just to prove that I could work. I still have a lot of time. You don\u2019t have to force your career to happen all at once.\n\nYou can read the entire article here, but we\u2019re just going to stand and give a Wakandan salute to Amandla Stenberg for doing the work of self-awareness and true sisterhood. This is how you walk the talk.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(Editor\u2019s note: Since publication of this article, we\u2019ve received further clarification from one one of our intrepid sci-fi loving readers that kind of like Jesus, the character of Rue was described as having \u201cdark brown skin and eyes\u201d and \u201chair like moss\u201d in The Hunger Games novel. So, those in opposition to Stenberg playing the role weren\u2019t even protesting color-blind casting. They were just plain racist.

Today I am here to admit to white America that I was totally wrong about Orenthal James Simpson. (I know using \u201cwhite\u201d as an adjective to describe \u201cAmerica\u201d is redundant, but I just want to make sure I acknowledge the Caucasians who \u201cbuilt this country\u201d because\u2014aside from history books, movies, television, literature, the national narrative and Donald Trump rallies\u2014you rarely receive the credit you are due. Big ups to you.)\n\nOn Sunday night, Fox News reignited the ire of white people who are still dumbstruck that a man could get away with an obvious murder when the decidedly unfair and mentally imbalanced network aired a decade-old interview of O.J. Simpson appearing to confess, in which he laid out how he might have, theoretically, murdered his ex-wife Nicole Brown and her friend Ron Goldman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhite America, I am now on your side. I couldn\u2019t have been more wrong. You were right all along.\n\nWhite people hate O.J. For them, he is evil incarnate. After all, if a black man could get away with killing a white woman in a wealthy neighborhood, how could anyone feel safe?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can\u2019t fathom how black-hearted I must have seemed back in 1995 when I applauded the O.J. verdict. I now realize how upset you guys must have felt to see a cold-blooded killer like O.J. get set free. Well, actually, I forgot that I felt those same emotions after the George Zimmerman acquittal.\n\nAnd the Betty Shelby trial.\n\nAnd the Philando Castile decision.\n\nAnd the decision not to indict Darren Wilson for the shooting death of Michael Brown Jr.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd the acquittal of Jeronimo Yanez.\n\nOK, I also now realize that saying \u201cI now realize\u201d was probably a bad choice of words.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: I always believed O.J. did that shit.\n\n\n\nWhen black people celebrated the O.J. acquittal in 1995, it was not because we thought he was a symbol of innocence and purity who was preparing to buy NBC. It was because the O.J. case exposed the bigotry that permeates the entire justice system in America and how\u2014despite his celebrity, wealth and resources\u2014a black man could be deemed guilty simply from an outpouring of alabaster outrage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe believed that he was a murderer and we believed the Los Angeles Police Department tried to frame him by tampering with evidence. Both things were probably true. Given black people\u2019s relationship with cops, the then-recent Rodney King verdict, the criminal-justice system and the legacy of black men who were lynched for breathing in the direction of white women, I\u2019m sure you could understand why we celebrated the O.J. verdict. We weren\u2019t on O.J.\u2019s team. We were Team JohnnyCochran. We were #TeamFuckTheLAPD.\n\nThis Lying, Murdering Whore Called America Today\u2014almost a year after a man who took an oath to protect and serve sent a bullet into the skull\u2026 Read more Read\n\nBut before Fox\u2019s O.J. special, I had never seen someone give a detailed explanation of how they murdered an innocent human being with a straight face and showing no remorse. To be fair, I missed George Zimmerman\u2019s interview on Hannity. I also forgot to DVR his appearance on CNN. Oh, and that Daily Beast article where he said that Trayvon Martin\u2019s parents \u201cdidn\u2019t raise him right\u201d and treated him \u201clike a dog without a leash\u201d\u2014I never got around to reading it. So this was my first time witnessing something like this.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut now that O.J. has hypothetically confessed on national television, I understand how you feel that our system shouldn\u2019t let an unrepentant killer walk around white women all willy-nilly. He may have been found not guilty in a court of law, but that doesn\u2019t mean he is innocent. What if he\u2019s triggered by a different pair of thin upper lips or oblate buttocks and goes on another killing spree? We just watched him confess!\n\nI felt the same way about Betty Shelby, who admitted on 60 Minutes that Terence Crutcher was not belligerent and not aggressive and had his hands up with his back to her when she shot him in Tulsa, Okla. Shelby is now back patrolling the streets as a law enforcement officer. So is Daniel Pantaleo, the man whose arms just happened to be wrapped around Eric Garner\u2019s throat in a loving caress when Garner died on a New York City sidewalk.\n\nI haven\u2019t heard any white outrage about the potential of someone becoming a victim of those two not-convicted killers, but I\u2019m sure white people are equally concerned. I probably missed it because I was still giddy from dancing at the secret, black O.J. victory party. Pantaleo and Shelby are still paid to carry guns and \u201cuphold the law.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut O.J., though.\n\nI recognize that my change of heart may be long overdue, but you know what they say: Better late than never.

Black women showed up and showed out in various ways. Black men put their careers and livelihoods on the line to speak out against racial injustice, police violence, and sexual assault and harassment. Creative artists experienced amazing glow ups, and black teenagers all over the country showed that no matter what, still we rise. Let\u2019s take a look at some of the biggest winners of 2017.\n\nBlack Activism\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a year that began with us getting the worst president in the world, black activists continued to do the work to help black people stay alive and get free. That activism took on many forms\u2014from protests both loud and silent to creative arts projects to writing\u2014and it was prolific in the year 2017.\n\nBlack people fought and continued to fight for clean water for the people of Flint, Mich., as well as other cities; social justice; economic justice; and an end to the state-sanctioned murder of black people at the hands of police. These fights are not over, and if 2017 was any indication, our voices will only get louder in 2018.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeyonc\u00e9\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 broke the internet in February when she announced that she was pregnant with twins via an Instagram post, and her year went on an upswing that has not ended. Although we know she has plenty of haters, it\u2019s hard to understand how you can hate on someone so graceful, so beautiful, so talented and so free in her own black womanhood. Her pregnancy led to the birth of beautiful twins\u2014 which she has blessed us with time and time again. Oh, and Sir and Rumi were cute, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer charity and generosity are not always made public, but she gives from the heart when it matters most. Not to mention, her after-pregnancy snapback was real and an inspiration to us all. Deep down inside, she is just a \u201cTexas bama\u201d who has her fangirl moments just like the rest of us, and we are here for it. Long live Queen Bey.\n\nFenty Beauty\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe all have our own favorite makeup brands, but when Rihanna announced that she would be launching Fenty Beauty in September, black girls (and the rest of y\u2019all) went crazy. No, she didn\u2019t make it just for us, but she made it for us in that she kept black girls in mind when creating the color ranges. The products flew off the shelves faster than they could be stocked.\n\nFenty had other beauty lines shook time and time again because Fenty had the range. Just one month in, Fenty had $72 million in earned media value, showing us that the combination of Black Girl Magic and black-girl social media capital is a guaranteed win. Right on, Fenty. Right on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack High School Seniors Accepted to College\n\nDespite being told by America every single day that their lives don\u2019t matter, black students continued to push forward and show that yes, the hell they do. Even as people tried to call them underachievers and say they are destined to a life of nothingness, black kids stood up and loudly proclaimed, \u201cYes, we can!\u201d Whether they were getting accepted to all eight Ivy League schools, heading off to Harvard or fulfilling their dream of going to their favorite HBCU, black high school seniors did the damn thing in 2017, and we are proud of y\u2019all. Keep pushing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCardi B\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe don\u2019t dance no more, she makes money moves. If you look up the phrase \u201cglow up\u201d in the dictionary, right after the definition of the new vertical on The Root, there will be a picture of Cardi B, her tongue hanging out and the look of win on her face, because she seriously glowed up in 2017. Regardless of how you may feel about her, your hate and a Grammy snub won\u2019t stop her shine. She signed big deals, had one of the biggest hits of the year (my current theme song/anthem), got big props from the Queen herself\u2014and despite rumors of a potential breakup, her boo Offset proposed to her with an 8-carat diamond ring. Cardi did 2017 big as hell, and we can only expect that will continue in 2018.\n\nTerry Crews\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt takes a black man who is strong in will and mind to display restraint and not beat the shit out of a perverted white man who gropes his genitals in full view of everyone at a Hollywood party. It takes an even stronger black man to come forward during the #MeToo storm and admit that he, too, was sexually violated by a powerful white man in Hollywood. That strong black man was Terry Crews.\n\nWhile some questioned why he didn\u2019t just pummel Adam Venit when the Hollywood power broker allegedly grabbed his genitals at a party, Crews showed that it\u2019s a game of chess, not checkers, and in the end, the sound mind wins. He filed a police report, filed a lawsuit and spoke out against sexual assault in Hollywood, letting everyone know that he would not be a victim. He was named one of Time magazine\u2019s \u201csilence breakers.\u201d He dropped WME\u2014the agency Venit worked for that basically did nothing to protect Crews and everything to protect Venit\u2014and moved on to new representation, all without being the stereotypical angry black man that everyone wanted or expected him to be.\n\nThat is the very definition of winning. Kudos, Terry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBarack Obama\n\nBarack Obama won 2017 the day he left office as the president of the United States. I am very sure it was like when Scarface quit his job in Half Baked.\n\nOur president started wearing less and going out more. He sent his wife a cute Valentine\u2019s Day tweet. He got crowds and applause just for being a regular-ass dude. People wanted so much more of him, the bidding war over his memoirs reached $60 million. He received the 2017 JFK Profile in Courage Award. He even reported for jury duty in Chicago. He basically showed everyone that leaving the presidency hasn\u2019t stopped his shine or his charisma, and your orange-colored Oompa Loompa of a president could never. Come through, Barack. Come through.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nColin Kaepernick\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNFL ratings are down, and league officials don\u2019t know what to do about it. Good. The NFL deserves whatever \u201cL\u2019s\u201d it gets because the NFL turned its back on Colin Kaepernick. Meanwhile, Kaepernick continues to shine. When he started his silent protests during the national anthem last year, he was widely criticized by people who didn\u2019t understand his need and desire to fight for black lives or the recognition he got for it. None of that matters. Despite it all, Kaepernick is living his best life. He has gotten award after award, and he is even considering buying an NFL team. Take that, NFL. Long live Colin Kaepernick.\n\nBlack Women\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2017 was the year of the black woman. From your Auntie Maxine Waters to Serena Williams winning the Australian Open while pregnant to Karen Bass\u2019 hilarious takedown of Jeff Sessions to black women showing up to guarantee Roy Moore did not win in Alabama to Tarana Burke and the #MeToo movement, black women were here for you. Black women have always been here for you. Black women will continue to be here for you. Now black women need you to be here for us.

I say that because, often, clothes can be pretty but puzzling at the same time. Now, under the direction of designer Maria Grazia Chiuri, Dior speaks to women loud and clear. What\u2019s Grazia Chiuri got to say? For one, \u201cWe Should All Be Feminists\u201d\u2014the theme of her breakout collection for the house of Dior for Spring 2017.\n\nThe theme was taken from the essay of the same name written by the Nigerian writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, a brilliant manifesto on womanhood and citizenship that reads like the Wakandan Bill of Rights. Most people who wear the now ubiquitous T-shirt don\u2019t know its origin, but they\u2019ve gotten the message that the future is female.\n\nChimamanda Ngozi Adichie (Ted Talks)\n\nWhich brings us to Wednesday\u2019s Dior Fall/Winter 2018/2019 presentation in Paris, where Dior\u2019s women were still on the march. The collection was inspired by Paris\u2019 \u201cyouthquake\u201d in the summer of 1968, when students literally took to the streets, ripping cobblestones from the ground and hurling them at police, demanding better employment opportunities and reform of the university system. Being ever fashion-minded, young women protested long hemlines in front of the Dior boutique, brandishing signs reading, \u201cSupport the Mini Skirt.\u201d\n\nGrazia Chiuri, who is Italian and the former designer of Valentino, stumbled upon the photo while searching Dior\u2019s archives, as she recounted to London\u2019s Guardian newspaper:\n\nAnd then I discovered that [Marc] Bohan\u2019s response, [who designed Dior at the time], to this was to introduce the Miss Dior line, to give these younger consumers what they wanted. I thought it was so interesting to see fashion listening to women. And there is something about now that is similar to 1968. This is another moment when everything is changing.\n\nYes, we are again in a moment when everything is changing regarding women in the workplace and shaping the perception of our own beauty and our bodies. With the advent of social media\u2014which in this writer\u2019s opinion has done as much for black women\u2019s beauty as hip-hop has done for black men\u2019s voices\u2014we are in an era of unparalleled agency on our own behalf. Grazia Chiuri is listening, and poised to provide us the uniform.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDior Fall 2018 Paris Runway (Dominique Charriau/Getty/WireImage) Dior Fall \u201918 Paris Runway (Dominique Charriau/Getty/WireImage) Dior Fall \u201918 Paris Runway (Dominique Charriau Getty/WireImage) Dior Fall \u201918 Paris Runway (Dominique Charriau Getty/WireImage) 1 / 4\n\nThe clothes at Dior this week were a throwback to a time when flower power and femininity were one and the same. Long, easy dresses in bright floral prints, patchwork coats and rose-colored glasses to no doubt help us get through dark times sailed down the runway with a youthful ease. Mixed in were sweaters emblazoned with slogans like \u201cC\u2019est non, non et non\u201d (\u201cIt\u2019s no, no and no\u201d), in a nod to the new-age rules of sexual consent.\n\nAnother strong theme shown at Dior and trending across runways from New York, London, Milan and now Paris this season were relaxed boxy blazers worn over kilts and pleated skirts. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s so much that designers want women to be schoolgirls, but it\u2019s a way to show that women are teaching the world right now\u2014and changing the rules for the better.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarch on, ladies. On this first day of Women\u2019s History Month, we owe our mothers a debt and our daughters a future of freedom and dignity for womanhood across the globe.

So imagine our surprise that one of the most melanin-rich presentations of the season almost escaped our notice: Maki Oh, by Nigerian designer Amaka Osakwe.\n\n\n\nBased in Lagos, Osakwe has been at the helm of her own label since 2010, and since that time she has become one of the few Nigerian designers to have a global reach. Her designs have been worn by Beyonc\u00e9, Kerry Washington and our forever first lady, Michelle Obama.\n\nThis season, Osakwe sent her models down the runway in a range of muted hues and quirky but sophisticated silhouettes and pattern combinations that seemed to evoke a type of nomadic chic. These immensely wearable clothes are for a woman who is not only worldly but also winsome, featuring wonderfully cut trousers, satiny sliplike pieces under suiting fabrics, and lam\u00e9 coats that I\u2019m literally swooning over. (Seriously. Gimme.)\n\nBut what was perhaps most beautiful about Maki Oh\u2019s presentation was that her models were all women of color, in all shades of color, seeming to represent the entirety of the African Diaspora itself\u2014with their natural hair textures, no less!\n\nIt was a refreshing, almost matter-of-fact occurrence, and consistent with Osakwe\u2019s castings over her last few seasons. But during a week when black representation has long been a struggle, it felt like a definite boost for the home team.

Today I am here to admit to white America that I was totally wrong about Orenthal James Simpson. (I know using \u201cwhite\u201d as an adjective to describe \u201cAmerica\u201d is redundant, but I just want to make sure I acknowledge the Caucasians who \u201cbuilt this country\u201d because\u2014aside from history books, movies, television, literature, the national narrative and Donald Trump rallies\u2014you rarely receive the credit you are due. Big ups to you.)\n\nOn Sunday night, Fox News reignited the ire of white people who are still dumbstruck that a man could get away with an obvious murder when the decidedly unfair and mentally imbalanced network aired a decade-old interview of O.J. Simpson appearing to confess, in which he laid out how he might have, theoretically, murdered his ex-wife Nicole Brown and her friend Ron Goldman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhite America, I am now on your side. I couldn\u2019t have been more wrong. You were right all along.\n\nWhite people hate O.J. For them, he is evil incarnate. After all, if a black man could get away with killing a white woman in a wealthy neighborhood, how could anyone feel safe?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can\u2019t fathom how black-hearted I must have seemed back in 1995 when I applauded the O.J. verdict. I now realize how upset you guys must have felt to see a cold-blooded killer like O.J. get set free. Well, actually, I forgot that I felt those same emotions after the George Zimmerman acquittal.\n\nAnd the Betty Shelby trial.\n\nAnd the Philando Castile decision.\n\nAnd the decision not to indict Darren Wilson for the shooting death of Michael Brown Jr.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd the acquittal of Jeronimo Yanez.\n\nOK, I also now realize that saying \u201cI now realize\u201d was probably a bad choice of words.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: I always believed O.J. did that shit.\n\n\n\nWhen black people celebrated the O.J. acquittal in 1995, it was not because we thought he was a symbol of innocence and purity who was preparing to buy NBC. It was because the O.J. case exposed the bigotry that permeates the entire justice system in America and how\u2014despite his celebrity, wealth and resources\u2014a black man could be deemed guilty simply from an outpouring of alabaster outrage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe believed that he was a murderer and we believed the Los Angeles Police Department tried to frame him by tampering with evidence. Both things were probably true. Given black people\u2019s relationship with cops, the then-recent Rodney King verdict, the criminal-justice system and the legacy of black men who were lynched for breathing in the direction of white women, I\u2019m sure you could understand why we celebrated the O.J. verdict. We weren\u2019t on O.J.\u2019s team. We were Team JohnnyCochran. We were #TeamFuckTheLAPD.\n\nThis Lying, Murdering Whore Called America Today\u2014almost a year after a man who took an oath to protect and serve sent a bullet into the skull\u2026 Read more Read\n\nBut before Fox\u2019s O.J. special, I had never seen someone give a detailed explanation of how they murdered an innocent human being with a straight face and showing no remorse. To be fair, I missed George Zimmerman\u2019s interview on Hannity. I also forgot to DVR his appearance on CNN. Oh, and that Daily Beast article where he said that Trayvon Martin\u2019s parents \u201cdidn\u2019t raise him right\u201d and treated him \u201clike a dog without a leash\u201d\u2014I never got around to reading it. So this was my first time witnessing something like this.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut now that O.J. has hypothetically confessed on national television, I understand how you feel that our system shouldn\u2019t let an unrepentant killer walk around white women all willy-nilly. He may have been found not guilty in a court of law, but that doesn\u2019t mean he is innocent. What if he\u2019s triggered by a different pair of thin upper lips or oblate buttocks and goes on another killing spree? We just watched him confess!\n\nI felt the same way about Betty Shelby, who admitted on 60 Minutes that Terence Crutcher was not belligerent and not aggressive and had his hands up with his back to her when she shot him in Tulsa, Okla. Shelby is now back patrolling the streets as a law enforcement officer. So is Daniel Pantaleo, the man whose arms just happened to be wrapped around Eric Garner\u2019s throat in a loving caress when Garner died on a New York City sidewalk.\n\nI haven\u2019t heard any white outrage about the potential of someone becoming a victim of those two not-convicted killers, but I\u2019m sure white people are equally concerned. I probably missed it because I was still giddy from dancing at the secret, black O.J. victory party. Pantaleo and Shelby are still paid to carry guns and \u201cuphold the law.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut O.J., though.\n\nI recognize that my change of heart may be long overdue, but you know what they say: Better late than never.

Zimmerman also alleges that an unspecified amount of money was paid to his ex-wife for her participation in the documentary.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne has to wonder if Zimmerman realizes that in Florida, making credible threats that may place a person, in this case Jay-Z, in fear of their life is a felony.

Richmond, Democrat from New Orleans and chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, wrote a three-page letter Wednesday to Donald Trump declining his invitation to the CBC to meet with him, and outlining the many reasons the group as a whole is saying no.\n\nIn a letter dated June 21 (pdf), Richmond opened by acknowledging the president\u2019s recent request to meet with the CBC:\n\nIn written communication dating back to January 2017, we have shared the priorities of the Caucus as they relate to the Black community. We are serious about the work of advancing the interests of our people and the goals of the CBC. As a result, we took advantage of every opportunity to educate you on the needs of the Black community and provide you with the information and solutions necessary to act on them in good faith. Through an objective assessment, we have seen no evidence that your Administration acted on our calls for action, and we have in fact witnessed steps that will affirmatively hurt Black communities. While we agreed to explore possible future discussions when we first met, it has become abundantly clear that a conversation with the entire CBC would not be entirely productive, given the actions taken by your Administration since our first meeting. While you can solicit the engagement of individual members of our caucus, the CBC as a caucus declines your invitation to meet at this time.\n\nRichmond noted that in March, the CBC presented Trump with a 130-page policy document in order to educate him and his administration on the difficult history of black people in the United States, the history of the CBC and solutions that could help advance black families in the 21st century. The Trump administration has both failed to respond to the policies the CBC outlined and neglected to follow through on its pledge to facilitate meetings between the CBC and relevant Cabinet officials, Richmond said.\n\nIn other words, Trump and his administration have only paid lip service to addressing the needs of black people in the U.S. and never intended to follow through on any of the empty promises that have been made thus far.\n\nIn fact, as Richmond outlined, the administration has acted in opposition to the policy initiatives the caucus has supported, proposing budget cuts to programs that serve low- and moderate-income people, including a $4 billion cut to Pell Grants, which help low-income students pay for college; and the complete elimination of the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, \u201cwhich helps seniors and other helpless populations heat their homes in the winter and cool them in the summer.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the letter, Richmond added:\n\nMoreover, your administration has taken actions that cause legitimate alarm among members of this caucus and the millions of Americans we represent. In a two-page document, your Attorney General issued guidance to federal prosecutors to accelerate the failed war on drugs that will continue to wreck the Black community and exacerbate our nation\u2019s scourge of mass incarceration. Attorney General Sessions has also explicitly stated his unwillingness to utilize consent decrees to protect the civil rights of Americans and has called for an agency-wide review of these agreements. These shortsighted decisions represent willful ignorance by relying on ideology instead of data and compassion. Every dollar we spend on incarceration renders our communities less safe.\n\nIn other words, we see your boy implementing and creating policies that specifically and disproportionately target the black community at large, and this is not a game, Mr. President.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition, Richmond continued, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has caused a number of HBCUs to lose critical funding through the \u201cTRiO\u201d programs (a reference to a number of federal programs intended to help economically disadvantaged students) (pdf), she has refused to protect children from being discriminated against, and she terminated an Obama administration program focused on improving school diversity and student achievement in the lowest-performing schools across the country.\n\nOf course, these atrocities pale in comparison with the decimation of our nation\u2019s health care system. Richmond noted that black people make up 13.3 percent of the U.S. population but 19 percent of Medicaid enrollees, and would therefore be dealt a painful blow by \u201cmean[-spirited]\u201d legislation proposed under the Trump administration.\n\nRichmond went on to outline eight times the CBC has sent written letters to Trump himself and members of his administration, letters that have thus far gone unanswered, because clearly neither the president nor anyone who works for him truly cares about black people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRichmond concluded, \u201cGiven the lack of response to any of the main concerns we have raised with you and your Administration, we decline your invitation for all 49 members of the Congressional Black Caucus to meet with you. The CBC, and the millions of people we represent, have a lot to lose under your Administration. I fail to see how a social gathering would benefit the policies we advocate for. The CBC will always be willing to engage in discussion and debate about policies and programs that will make America a more perfect union for all.\u201d\n\nIn other words, fuck your photo ops and bullshit promises.\n\nCedric Richmond had the words and the tact to say what we are all thinking in a much nicer way than the president deserves, but he was also direct, pointed and full of facts, and called Trump out for being full of shit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe, \u201cthe blacks,\u201d are tired of the empty promises of the American dream and the \u201cmore perfect union.\u201d We need results that benefit us as much as they benefit those who hold privilege over us.\n\nEnough is enough.\n\nEither shit or get off the pot, Donald Trump.", "keywords": ["caucus", "trump", "administration", "dont", "policies", "cbc", "members", "richmond", "words", "care", "congressional", "black", "programs"], "polarity": 0.03136604136604137, "subjectivity": 0.4895652290096733},

Today I am here to admit to white America that I was totally wrong about Orenthal James Simpson. (I know using \u201cwhite\u201d as an adjective to describe \u201cAmerica\u201d is redundant, but I just want to make sure I acknowledge the Caucasians who \u201cbuilt this country\u201d because\u2014aside from history books, movies, television, literature, the national narrative and Donald Trump rallies\u2014you rarely receive the credit you are due. Big ups to you.)\n\nOn Sunday night, Fox News reignited the ire of white people who are still dumbstruck that a man could get away with an obvious murder when the decidedly unfair and mentally imbalanced network aired a decade-old interview of O.J. Simpson appearing to confess, in which he laid out how he might have, theoretically, murdered his ex-wife Nicole Brown and her friend Ron Goldman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhite America, I am now on your side. I couldn\u2019t have been more wrong. You were right all along.\n\nWhite people hate O.J. For them, he is evil incarnate. After all, if a black man could get away with killing a white woman in a wealthy neighborhood, how could anyone feel safe?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can\u2019t fathom how black-hearted I must have seemed back in 1995 when I applauded the O.J. verdict. I now realize how upset you guys must have felt to see a cold-blooded killer like O.J. get set free. Well, actually, I forgot that I felt those same emotions after the George Zimmerman acquittal.\n\nAnd the Betty Shelby trial.\n\nAnd the Philando Castile decision.\n\nAnd the decision not to indict Darren Wilson for the shooting death of Michael Brown Jr.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd the acquittal of Jeronimo Yanez.\n\nOK, I also now realize that saying \u201cI now realize\u201d was probably a bad choice of words.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: I always believed O.J. did that shit.\n\n\n\nWhen black people celebrated the O.J. acquittal in 1995, it was not because we thought he was a symbol of innocence and purity who was preparing to buy NBC. It was because the O.J. case exposed the bigotry that permeates the entire justice system in America and how\u2014despite his celebrity, wealth and resources\u2014a black man could be deemed guilty simply from an outpouring of alabaster outrage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe believed that he was a murderer and we believed the Los Angeles Police Department tried to frame him by tampering with evidence. Both things were probably true. Given black people\u2019s relationship with cops, the then-recent Rodney King verdict, the criminal-justice system and the legacy of black men who were lynched for breathing in the direction of white women, I\u2019m sure you could understand why we celebrated the O.J. verdict. We weren\u2019t on O.J.\u2019s team. We were Team JohnnyCochran. We were #TeamFuckTheLAPD.\n\nThis Lying, Murdering Whore Called America Today\u2014almost a year after a man who took an oath to protect and serve sent a bullet into the skull\u2026 Read more Read\n\nBut before Fox\u2019s O.J. special, I had never seen someone give a detailed explanation of how they murdered an innocent human being with a straight face and showing no remorse. To be fair, I missed George Zimmerman\u2019s interview on Hannity. I also forgot to DVR his appearance on CNN. Oh, and that Daily Beast article where he said that Trayvon Martin\u2019s parents \u201cdidn\u2019t raise him right\u201d and treated him \u201clike a dog without a leash\u201d\u2014I never got around to reading it. So this was my first time witnessing something like this.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut now that O.J. has hypothetically confessed on national television, I understand how you feel that our system shouldn\u2019t let an unrepentant killer walk around white women all willy-nilly. He may have been found not guilty in a court of law, but that doesn\u2019t mean he is innocent. What if he\u2019s triggered by a different pair of thin upper lips or oblate buttocks and goes on another killing spree? We just watched him confess!\n\nI felt the same way about Betty Shelby, who admitted on 60 Minutes that Terence Crutcher was not belligerent and not aggressive and had his hands up with his back to her when she shot him in Tulsa, Okla. Shelby is now back patrolling the streets as a law enforcement officer. So is Daniel Pantaleo, the man whose arms just happened to be wrapped around Eric Garner\u2019s throat in a loving caress when Garner died on a New York City sidewalk.\n\nI haven\u2019t heard any white outrage about the potential of someone becoming a victim of those two not-convicted killers, but I\u2019m sure white people are equally concerned. I probably missed it because I was still giddy from dancing at the secret, black O.J. victory party. Pantaleo and Shelby are still paid to carry guns and \u201cuphold the law.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut O.J., though.\n\nI recognize that my change of heart may be long overdue, but you know what they say: Better late than never. (Actually, I don\u2019t know if \u201cthey\u201d really say that, but I hope the teller says it with a smile on that glorious day when I\u2019m at the bank filling out the slip to deposit my reparations check.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause I now identify with your outrage after watching a murderer hypothetically confess to a theoretical crime for which he will never be punished. When I see you at the Black Lives Matter march the next time a police officer murders an innocent person of color and gets away with it, I will be sure to apologize to your face. Or maybe I\u2019ll do it when I see you applauding NFL players who are kneeling in hopes that it will bring attention to the kinds of injustice that you are surprisingly so upset about.\n\nAfter all, if you\u2019re mad at O.J., you should be mad at anyone who kills an innocent, unarmed, defenseless human being and gets away with it. If Fox News viewers are incensed about O.J., then the only way they couldn\u2019t be equally infuriated about the disproportionate killing of innocent black people by obviously guilty police officers is if they were racist. But they are not, because all lives matter ...\n\nHypothetically.", "keywords": ["right", "america", "white", "innocent", "simpson", "hypothetical", "confession", "sure", "away", "realize", "oj", "black", "man", "watching", "shelby", "wrong"], "polarity": 0.040153122455102656, "subjectivity": 0.48566481648164816},

Case in point: For the first time since Naomi Campbell\u2019s opening strut back in 1997, Prada tapped a black model to open its fashion show (Jourdan Dunn is the only other black model to be booked by this global powerhouse brand since 2008). The coveted career-making position went to 19-year-old Sudanese model of the moment, Anok Yai.\n\nPrada\n\nYai, who was raised in Egypt, was discovered when photographer Steven Hall\u2019s Afrocentric street-style blog The Sunk posted a photo of her at Howard\u2019s 2017 homecoming that went viral last fall. Now exploding with over 144,000 Instagram followers, she\u2019s poised to blow all the way up.\n\nLuckily, Yai happens to be represented by Kyle Hagler, president of Next Models. Hagler, one of the most powerful agents in the business, also happens to be black. Booking Prada is a triumph for model and agent alike, and though, in my opinion, the brand has a very long way to go before I would support it with my dollars or clicks, it is clearly evolving.\n\nBut overall, Milan showed a lot of beautiful black women on its fall runways. Natural hair and glowing skin were the order of the day, from Versace to Fendi.\n\nAt Versace, \u201990s neon brights mixed with punk and ska-inspired plaid and black-and-white checks were the theme. Mixed patterns and bright colors are classic vintage Versace\u2014an exuberant kind of youth riot that fashion insiders and consumers can\u2019t seem to get enough of, judging by the FX hit miniseries American Crime Story: The Assassination of Gianni Versace, not to mention the number of Versace heritage prints I once again see people wearing on the streets of New York.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProving that the trend is catching, Prada was also full of neon brights and industrial-inspired designs that reminded me a bit of designer Virgil Abloh\u2019s aesthetic at Off-White.\n\nVersace Fall/Winter 2018 (Catwalking/Getty Images) Versace Fall/Winter 2018 (Catwalking/Getty Images) Versace Fall/Winter 2018 (Catwalking/Getty Images) Versace Fall/Winter 2018 (Catwalking/Getty Images) Versace Fall/Winter 2018 (Catwalking/Getty Images) 1 / 5\n\nFendi never disappoints.

Fendi captured exactly the way I want to look when it\u2019s frosty outside: Fabulous mink capes with appliqu\u00e9d florals and mink logo-printed sweatshirts came swishing down the runway, carried on perfectly padded shoulders that looked just right for the moment.

Too often, this crucial segment of designers\u2019 clientele is not acknowledged on American or European runways.\n\nConservative Muslim women account for $266 billion (yes, BILLION) of the global clothing and footwear business. As a model, I worked very closely with designers who, in the \u201990s, did private showings after the main press presentations, offering to lengthen skirts and create matching hijabs for distribution to conservative Muslim clients. Never would you have seen a hijab-wearing model on the runways, until Dolce & Gabbana broke that barrier back in 2016. Now beautiful models with conservative beliefs are taking their turn and their respect as they walk the runways.\n\nMax Mara Fall/Winter 2018 (Catwalking/Getty Images) Max Mara Fall/Winter 2018 (Catwalking/Getty Images) Max Mara Fall/Winter 2018 (Catwalking/Getty Images) Max Mara Fall/Winter 2018 (Catwalking/Getty Images) Max Mara Fall/Winter 2018 (Catwalking/Getty Images) 1 / 5\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs I said, I like the moment we\u2019re in right now: a movement toward inclusion, and celebrating power on the runways.

But as she tells Allure in its March issue, her own journey to choosing to wear her hair in its natural state was a very different one from the almost instantaneous success she enjoyed after being cast in her Oscar-winning role in 12 Years a Slave.\n\nAs a tween in Kenya, Nyong\u2019o was teased and felt \u201creally unpretty\u201d in comparison with her classmates\u2014who almost all wore their hair relaxed. Her mother wanted her to wait until near adulthood to relax her hair but eventually acquiesced to her daughter\u2019s pleas. Nyong\u2019o explains:\n\nShe took me to the salon in the middle of the school day, and I got my hair relaxed. I felt so much better because it was easier to tame. All the girls in my class had their hair relaxed. Very few had natural kink, so I felt a lot more acceptable. I had my hair relaxed for most of my teenage years, and that was a whole other world. The upkeep of relaxed hair is a commitment. It took styling it once a week and then having it retouched once a month. I remember doing crazy things, like sleeping with my head above the headboard so that my curls wouldn\u2019t get messed up for the next day. I\u2019d have these terrible neck aches because I was determined to keep my hair as pristine as possible. And it was super expensive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, Nyongo\u2019s conversion back to natural hair began in response to a joke from her father while she was asking him for money to support her relaxer habit: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just cut it all off?\u201d he said. She did, having her head shaved completely bald, a choice that she told Allure was \u201cliberating.\u201d\n\nBut the choice wasn\u2019t a cure-all; Nyong\u2019o struggled with managing her texture for years, especially after moving to the northeastern United States for college and graduate school:\n\nMoving to the U.S. was very difficult because I didn\u2019t have the same kind of support system. [Braiding] services were not readily available in Amherst, Massachusetts. For a long time I would braid my hair in Kenya and then spend months with the braids in when I got to the States so that I didn\u2019t have to worry about my hair. Also, my hair did something very different in freezing weather, which I didn\u2019t know how to handle. My hair needs moisture. It needs warmth. All of a sudden I was in this very cold environment, and my hair was bristly and dry and really hard to manage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd while it was Nyong\u2019o\u2019s work with famed stylist Ted Gibson that got many inspired about the versatility of natural hair, it was her current stylist, Vernon Franc\u0327ois, who helped her learn how to manage and care for her natural texture, thanks in large part to his eponymous line of products/ (Franc\u0327ois also provided some insight and tips on how he created the looks for Nyong\u2019o\u2019s Allure cover shoot.)\n\nNyong\u2019o says:\n\n\n\nOne thing I\u2019ve learned was the acronym LOC, and that\u2019s basically the rule for how to treat my hair: liquid, oil, and then cream. It\u2019s the idea that you wet your hair first, then you add oil so that it can trap the moisture in, then you put a moisturizer or a cream over it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNyong\u2019o says that this is the longest her hair has been in a decade. And while we\u2019re guessing that a few extras were added to create the cloudlike coifs she rocks in Allure\u2019s March issue, we\u2019re liking the look on her.

Simpson wrote, If I Did It, about how he might have killed his ex-wife Nicole Brown and Ronald Goldman if he were the murderer, which he says he definitely wasn\u2019t?\n\n\n\nBack in 2006, Simpson did a brief publicity tour for the book, including an interview with Fox. Following protests from the Brown and Goldman families and a public backlash, however, the book was scrapped, along with the accompanying promotional interview.\n\nUntil now, that is. Fox has announced that it will be airing the controversial \u201cno holds barred\u201d interview Sunday night to compete with the premiere of another slice of pop culture that America has largely forgotten about: ABC\u2019s American Idol.\n\nBut why air the interview now?\n\nApparently, this time the Brown and Goldman families have given their approval.

Nelson addressed the jury in the second-degree murder trial of George Zimmerman in Florida and read her instructions to the jury (pdf). They included the following:\n\n\n\nIn deciding whether George Zimmerman was justified in the use of deadly force, you must judge him by the circumstances by which he was surrounded at the time the force was used. The danger facing George Zimmerman need not have been actual; however, to justify the use of deadly force, the appearance of danger must have been so real that a reasonably cautious and prudent person under the same circumstances would have believed that the danger could be avoided only through the use of that force. Based upon appearances, George Zimmerman must have actually believed that the danger was real. If George Zimmerman was not engaged in an unlawful activity and was attacked in any place where he had a right to be, he had no duty to retreat and had the right to stand his ground and meet force with force, including deadly force if he reasonably believed that it was necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or another or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony ... If in your consideration of the issue of self-defense you have a reasonable doubt on the question of whether George Zimmerman was justified in the use of deadly force, you should find George Zimmerman not guilty.\n\nNelson\u2019s jury instructions mirrored Florida Statute 776.012, which describes the justifiable use of force:\n\n(1) A person is justified in using or threatening to use force, except deadly force, against another when and to the extent that the person reasonably believes that such conduct is necessary to defend himself or herself or another against the other\u2019s imminent use of unlawful force. A person who uses or threatens to use force in accordance with this subsection does not have a duty to retreat before using or threatening to use such force. (2) A person is justified in using or threatening to use deadly force if he or she reasonably believes that using or threatening to use such force is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another or to prevent the imminent commission of a forcible felony. A person who uses or threatens to use deadly force in accordance with this subsection does not have a duty to retreat and has the right to stand his or her ground if the person using or threatening to use the deadly force is not engaged in a criminal activity and is in a place where he or she has a right to be.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe law was based on a legal precept called the \u201ccastle doctrine,\u201d which does not require a person with a gun to retreat in the face of danger, but most people know the law by its more famous nickname: \u201cStand your ground.\u201d\n\nThe jury eventually acquitted Zimmerman of the murder of Trayvon Martin, and for three years, no state could pass a version of the law. It was politically toxic in the age of Black Lives Matter, and every state that tried to pass similar legislation failed.\n\nBut in the last few months, under Republican legislatures, \u201cStand your ground\u201d has made a quiet resurgence. In September, Missouri became the first state to enact it since Trayvon\u2019s death. Iowa passed a sweeping gun measure April 13 that lets children handle firearms, allows citizens to sue cities that have \u201cgun-free zones\u201d and makes \u201cStand your ground\u201d state law.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow Florida is back at it again. According to the New York Times, the Sunshine State is set to strengthen its law by shifting the responsibility of proving immunity from the defendant to prosecutors. In short\u2014in Florida, if you kill another person with a gun and claim that you were defending yourself, it is up to the state to prove that your use of force was not justified.\n\nWhile this may seem like the usual conservative political gambit, there is something larger than the singular murder of Trayvon Martin at issue. \u201cStand your ground\u201d laws have repeatedly been shown to be biased. In fact, study after peer-reviewed study on the issue shows that \u201cStand your ground\u201d laws result in more homicides, and there is no doubt who benefits. Research shows that white men who shoot black men are more likely to benefit from such laws, which means that the resurrection of the castle doctrine will most likely mean that more white men will get away with killing black men.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2012 John Roman of the Urban Institute\u2019s Justice Policy Center conducted a study of \u201cStand your ground\u201d data using FBI statistics. He found that states with \u201cStand your ground\u201d laws reflect the same disparities in homicide convictions found in states without such laws\u2014with one significant exception:\n\nWhites who kill blacks in Stand Your Ground states are far more likely to be found justified in their killings. In non-Stand Your Ground states, whites are 250 percent more likely to be found justified in killing a black person than a white person who kills another white person; in Stand Your Ground states, that number jumps to 354 percent.\n\nRoman\u2019s findings were still deemed inconclusive because he used data from 2005 to 2009 and had a very low number of comparable white-on-black homicides in \u201cStand your ground\u201d states to compare (25). So Roman doubled back and completed a full, more thorough study and found that when the shooter is black, the homicide is justified in about 1 percent of cases in \u201cStand your ground\u201d states. When a white person kills a black person in a \u201cStand your ground\u201d state, the murder is justified 17 percent of the time (versus 11 percent in states without such laws).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore from Roman:\n\nFinally, I tested whether these racial disparities remained when we controlled for whether the victim and perpetrator were strangers, the state where the incident occurred, the year of the homicide, and whether the shooting occurred in a SYG state. The racial disparities remain large and significant. In fact, the odds that a white-on-black homicide is ruled to have been justified is more than 11 times the odds a black-on-white shooting is ruled justified.\n\nIn another \u201cStand your ground\u201d study that looked solely at cases in Florida, researchers discovered that between 2005 and 2013, Florida juries were twice as likely to convict the perpetrator of a crime against a white person as they were to convict in a crime against a person of color. \u201cThese results are similar to pre-civil rights era statistics, with strict enforcement for crimes when the victim was white and less-rigorous enforcement with the victim is non-white,\u201d the report said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe data is clear: \u201cStand your ground\u201d laws benefit white people who kill blacks.\n\nMaybe you\u2019ve heard the story of Trevor Dooley, the 69-year-old man who said he was protecting his neighborhood, like another certain neighborhood watchman. Dooley went across the street to shoo away a skateboarder and got into a fight with David James, who was 28 years younger, 6 inches taller and 70 pounds heavier.\n\nDooley pulled out his gun, James lunged for it, they wrestled on the ground and James ended up dead. It sounds eerily similar to the Zimmerman case, except that a judge denied Dooley the use of the \u201cStand your ground\u201d defense. There is one other big difference in the Dooley case: James, the dead man, was white, and Dooley was black.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis illustrates the larger point of the racially biased \u201cStand your ground\u201d law. Despite all the statistical and mathematical evidence, America has yet to answer one simple scientific question:\n\nWhich weighs more: a dead black body or a little white lie?", "keywords": ["kill", "blacks", "easier", "states", "force", "quietly", "makes", "white", "ground", "state", "deadly", "person", "law", "zimmerman", "resurrecting", "justified", "stand"], "polarity": 0.09198060209510596, "subjectivity": 0.4692013647929674},

At our first meeting, Eileen pinched my upper arm and said, \u201cLose 5 pounds,\u201d which I did!\n\nTGU: Did you get the sense that you were Ford\u2019s \u201cblack girl\u201d?\n\nDMR: In 1967, agents were trying to find models who were \u201cacceptable\u201d to clients who didn\u2019t really want to book black models. It was the light-skinned models, like Jolie [Jones, music producer Quincy Jones\u2019 eldest daughter] and I, who were considered acceptable. They said, \u201cOK, we can have a black girl because she\u2019s not too black!\u201d But, finally, we got Beverly Johnson, who was dark-skinned and beautiful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: You were a full-time model and a full-time student?\n\n\n\nDMR: Yes, sir! Right away, I was working for Glamour and Mademoiselle. I didn\u2019t know you couldn\u2019t do both!\n\n\n\nTGU: Tell me about becoming Northwestern University\u2019s first African-American homecoming queen.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDMR: It was uncomfortable. It was unexpected, and it was disrespected. At the time, I promised Northwestern they would never hear from me again.\n\nFour Caucasian sorority girls were elected to Homecoming Court, but not as the queen. One of them cried her little eyes out. When they called my name, the president of the university looked at me, held the crown over my head and said, \u201cI have to stand here while they take pictures,\u201d then turned and walked away.\n\nBackstage, while the court was introduced, one by one, the girls would go out and you would hear applause from the audience. Then \u201cDaphne\u201d was introduced \u2026 silence. So I hiked up my dress, walked across the stage, said, \u201cThank you,\u201d and went on about my business. At the homecoming football game, they gave me a little cup that didn\u2019t even have my name on it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, it was a blast. Jet magazine, Amsterdam News and press from all over the world had gotten hold of the story. My community\u2014the black community\u2014celebrated. I wasn\u2019t in the yearbook as homecoming queen because the administration told me it \u201cwasn\u2019t important.\u201d Forty years later, the Black Alumni Association gave me a Hall of Fame Award. The current university president apologized, asked me to crown the new homecoming queen and to join the advisory board.\n\nDaphne Maxwell is crowned homecoming queen of Northwestern University in 1967.

The photographer had me sit on a windowsill and smile. I was done in 15 minutes. A month-and-a-half later, I was walking by a newsstand and saw myself! No one told me that booking was for Glamour or I\u2019d made the cover. It\u2019s my most enduring photo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut there was another shoot that is my favorite. I thought, \u201cHoly cow! I\u2019m in a great bunch!\u201d It was a Ladies Home Journal article: \u201cFourteen Most Beautiful Women in the World.\u201d I was chosen as one of them. I was floored! It was 1968 or 1969, when Ladies Home Journal was a big magazine. Supermodel Cheryl Tiegs was in that picture.\n\n\n\nTGU: The path from model to actress seems to have been easy for you.\n\n\n\nDMR: I was a curious, adventurous woman. I had no qualms about walking through another door. My career and life have been luck, guided by a higher power.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: What is the biggest life lesson modeling taught you?\n\n\n\nDMR: Modeling taught me about self-love, and to separate work from real life. If you don\u2019t get a job or a booking, it is not about you, so don\u2019t be unhappy, because that was not your job.\n\n\n\nTGU: How have you seen things change in entertainment and fashion?\n\n\n\nDMR: I have seen that it has become more acceptable to be the person that you are. I have seen the dominant culture open their eyes\u2014or have their eyes opened to\u2014the possibility that there is something else out there they were not aware of, and that was us [black people]. The acceptance of that I have seen go through many changes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I first started on television, I was one of a few black women who was doing network television.

She, however, was not able to claim self-defense and use \u201cStand your ground.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe judge in Alexander\u2019s case instructed the jury, as it considered whether Alexander had acted in self-defense, that she had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that her husband was committing aggravated battery when she fired. The jury came back with a guilty verdict in 12 minutes.\n\n\n\nThe judge in the Zimmerman murder trial instructed the jury that Zimmerman had no duty to retreat. He was acquitted.\n\n\n\nAdding insult to grievous injury, the same prosecutor from the Zimmerman case, Angela Corey, had the discretion to add a \u201c10-20-life\u201d sentencing enhancement, which requires a 20-year minimum sentence when a firearm is discharged.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTruthout reports that the Florida Department of Corrections has noted that black people are more than twice as likely as white or Latino people to have the enhancement added to their sentence. And so it was with Alexander. Corey decided to add that enhancement, and Alexander was sentenced to 20 years in prison.\n\n\n\nAlso, although women commit murder far less often than men, they typically receive longer sentences for killing their male partners than men do who kill female partners, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. An estimated 40-80 percent of women convicted of murder acted in self-defense against their abusers. Alexander didn\u2019t even kill or harm Rico Gray. She just fired a warning shot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2013, an appeals court overturned Alexander\u2019s conviction, and the prosecutor once again charged Alexander with three counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. Alexander faced up to 60 years in prison. Eventually she agreed to a plea bargain that included time served for nearly three years she spent in prison.\n\nMarissa Alexander Takes Plea Deal Marissa Alexander will not have to go to trial after accepting a plea deal, in which she pleaded\u2026 Read more Read\n\nIn January, the mother of three was officially done with her two-year sentence of home confinement and electronic monitoring.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTruthout also reports that after midnight on Jan. 26, she drove to her sister\u2019s house, where she, her mother and her sister had a toast to her freedom. The next morning, she took her 6-year-old daughter to breakfast before dropping her off at school\u2014something that she\u2019d never before been able to do. That night, she took her 16-year-old twins to dinner. That weekend, family and friends threw a party in her honor. And finally, on Sunday, Alexander put a baseball cap on and headed to a local bar to watch a football game in anonymity.\n\nShe recounts to Truthout the struggle of home monitoring that forced her to recount her every move; sometimes human error messed up her schedule and she was unable to attend church services or take her children to the park. Still, she says, \u201cIn the grand scheme of things, you cannot compare home confinement to prisons.\u201d Yet the rigor of it leaves a lot of room for error\u2014and reimprisonment.\n\n\u201cI feel like it\u2019s moneymaking. Period,\u201d she told Truthout. \u201cYou are putting people in the position that they are trying to pay for something that is difficult for them to pay for,\u201d she said of the fees that most people on monitors are required to pay. Those that can\u2019t keep up with the fees are sent back to jail. \u201cWhatever money you paid to the system, they got, but you\u2019re back in jail, so now the taxpayers are paying for you. It\u2019s a mess.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI find myself wanting to stay in my house just like I was doing before,\u201d she added, noting that she hasn\u2019t become fully accustomed to the fact that she is free to go to the store or simply step outside her house when she wishes, without repercussions.\n\n\n\nIn February, Alexander spoke before the Florida Senate Rule Committee in favor of the state\u2019s Senate Bill 128, which would shift the burden of proof from the defendant to the state in \u201cStand your ground\u201d hearings.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just going to give you three numbers,\u201d she stated before the committee. \u201cNumber one. Number 12. And number 20. For me, one shot, a 12-minute verdict got me 20 years. I did go through a \u2018Stand your ground\u2019 hearing. And in that hearing, you could tell the court and the prosecution struggled with that because it was difficult. With that said, putting a defendant in the position where they have to bear the burden of proof, in my opinion, removes your constitutional right, the Fifth Amendment.\u201d\n\nShe has also started the Marissa Alexander Justice Project.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be part of what\u2019s already out there and use my experiences and my name to bring more to it,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cI\u2019m not separate from anybody.

No, it does not. If I may quote Margaret Mead, \u201cNever doubt that a large group of terrible and incompetent men can be president; indeed, they\u2019re the only ones who ever have.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut impeachment talk is in the air\u2014frantically so in Twitter circles that continue to share memes of Hillary Clinton laughing with Barack Obama and more reservedly among Republicans engaged in a whisper campaign about their yearnings for a President Mike Pence.\n\nDo they dare to dream? Do you?\n\nShould Trump be removed from office, the president of the United States will no longer be a deeply bigoted dummy whose political instincts appear to be limited to self-aggrandizement and spite. Instead, the president of the United States will be a deeply bigoted zealot whose political instincts appear to be limited to a draconian interpretation of his Christian faith and a scorched earth approach to the social safety net.\n\nWithin this administration, could any kind of removal scenario\u2014be it resignation, prison, or death\u2014lead to anyone other than a moral monster assuming the most powerful office in the world?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA great question, really.\n\nFirst, we should define our terms. What is it to be good? What is it to be a good president?\n\nFor our purposes, let\u2019s say that \u201cgood\u201d is the far end of a scale measuring to what extent a president will work to implement programs that will meaningfully decrease poverty, hunger, and injustice defined broadly across a range of issues from mass incarceration to the maternal mortality rate in this country. Lofty rhetoric that packages upward redistribution in the language of fairness and opportunity doesn\u2019t count, and let\u2019s avoid the mistake of conflating decorum with goodness because fuck that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow let\u2019s consider the line of succession.\n\n1. Vice President Mike Pence\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s pretty clear that while Pence, who is first up to bat, would restore a familiar kind of stability and the pretense of deep thought to the office, he would still follow a policy agenda that hews closely to what Trump and his Republican leadership have already laid out.\n\nThere would be staggering tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy and deplete the government of the resources necessary to its basic functioning. He would sign likely sign whatever healthcare repeal bill reached his desk, maybe even waiting until it included a measure to restrict Medicaid reimbursements for providers like Planned Parenthood, since he is a true believer in a way that Trump has never convincingly mustered.\n\nAs governor of Indiana, Pence signed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, the original version of which was broad enough to allow businesses to discriminate against any person seeking services and public accommodations as long as they could root the denial in their personal religious views. The modified version was more restrained, but still left LGBTQ residents of his state incredibly vulnerable to discrimination and with rights that were distinct and lesser than their cis and straight peers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe also allowed a public health crisis to run rampant in a rural county of his state as he resisted implementing a needle exchange program to combat an HIV outbreak. He eventually relented, and the transmission rate dropped.\n\nHe is bad by these and other metrics, so we must move on.\n\n2. House Speaker Paul Ryan\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, next up after Pence, is a devout Catholic who\u2014despite being hated by nuns\u2014uses his faith to justify many of the same discriminatory policies as the vice president. As an architect of the tax cut and healthcare repeal efforts currently swimming around in Congress, and a deep hater of poor people having ready access to food, shelter, and school lunches, he\u2019d obviously sign off on whatever decimation of the welfare state reached his desk.\n\nHe also skips leg day and has the haircut of a narcish child. Unacceptable.\n\n3. President pro tempore of the Senate Orrin Hatch\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNext comes Orrin Hatch, pro tempore of the Senate and Utah\u2019s senior senator. Hatch made headlines recently after responding to a question about the unpopularity of the House healthcare bill by observing that the healthcare-needing public\u2014greedy cancer patients, presumably\u2014get \u201con the dole\u201d and then never want to get off, bleeding it for every bit of chemotherapy and maintenance treatments they can get their cancerous little hands around.\n\nHatch is extremely conservative, but is reliably accused of being a fake Republican for doing things like acknowledging that repealing Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate will burn the American healthcare system down to a smoldering ash heap and agreeing to raise the debt limit. He likes block grants and spending caps on Medicaid, the part of the American Health Care Act that would hit the poor, children, and people with disabilities the hardest, and tax cuts for wealthy people.\n\nThe rightward lurch of his party has disciplined him into more of a partisan soldier in recent years, like the time an op-ed he\u2019d filed about not being persuaded by a meeting with Merrick Garland was published before the meeting ever happened.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs designated survivor during the inauguration, he could have been president right out the gate if some Biblical plague had hit the event. That didn\u2019t happen, and he would not be a good president, anyway.\n\n4. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe now reach into Trump\u2019s Cabinet, only to emerge with fistfuls of billionaires who may sometimes have occasionally progressive social views. Also Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a petite non-billionaire who comes to us from a time portal to the Jim Crow South.\n\nBut first up is Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Again, the formula is complicated here because he has never governed or held elected office, and so has no real policy trail to follow. What we do know about Tillerson is that he accepts the science of climate change, but, as the former chief executive of the largest oil company in the world and now a member of a climate-denying administration, doesn\u2019t feel compelled to do much about it.\n\nAs the Washington Post reported at the time of his nomination, \u201cHis political giving suggests an alignment with establishment Republican politics, having given to the Republican Party of Texas repeatedly, to House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.) and to other national Republican priorities.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTillerson has spent his entire professional life doing what is best for the oil industry, and so it seems fair to assume his presidency would be something like putting a talking oil rig in the Oval Office. Let\u2019s move on.\n\n5. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSteve Mnuchin, hedge fund millionaire and former Goldman Sachs executive, first joined Trump\u2019s campaign last spring as finance chairman. Like Tillerson, he has no experience in political office so no paper trail of votes or policy. (He\u2019s donated to both Democrats and Republicans in the past.)\n\nWhat we do know is that before observing Trump spend an entire year making egregiously racist statements about Mexican immigrants and Muslim people and deciding he wanted to jump on that train, Mnuchin made a truly immoral amount of money kicking people out of their homes.\n\nTrump also spent a significant amount of time during his presidential campaign railing against Wall Street paper pushers like Mnuchin\u2014people who, like him, made money through passive transaction and tax loopholes that distribute wealth ever upward\u2014but no matter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause Eve ate the apple and we live in a fallen world, it\u2019s worth acknowledging that Mnuchin might not be Pence- or Ryan-levels of depraved on certain issues. But his fealty to Wall Street, combined with Congressional Republicans\u2019 fealty to Wall Street, would be catastrophic for everyone except for people as rich as Mnuchin, who is rich by even obscene rich people standards.\n\nOnward.\n\n6. Defense Secretary James Mattis\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe have now reached the first of Trump\u2019s generals, a group that the president deifies in good times and diminishes when things go wrong in military operations that he has largely outsourced thinking about or authorizing. Mattis, whose nickname is \u201cMad Dog,\u201d is considered a moderating influence on the Trump administration, which says more about the Trump administration than Mattis.\n\nThe former general had the good sense to denounce the Muslim ban during Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, and the bad sense to serve in the Cabinet of a president working to impose a Muslim ban. He is hawkish on Iran\u2014reportedly walking the country to the brink of military engagement last February\u2014and may have committed war crimes in Iraq. These things are familiar in the realm of American power, and unacceptable all the same.\n\n7. Attorney General Jeff Sessions\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo. No. No.\n\n8. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI could not be more thrilled that Donald Trump selected him,\u201d outgoing Utah Representative and reported future Fox News employee Jason Chaffetz told The New York Times in March, before reflecting on earlier conversations he\u2019s had with the former Republican congressman from Montana: \u201cWe talked about: \u2018The war on coal is over. We\u2019ve got friendlier, greener pastures ahead of us.\u2019 And there is a great deal of optimism and smiles on people\u2019s faces that we haven\u2019t seen in years.\u201d\n\nIf Chaffetz, who gleefully scooted back from emergency surgery to cast a vote stripping 24 million people of health insurance, is smiling, you probably shouldn\u2019t be. Zinke, like Tillerson, is not a climate skeptic, but is similarly noncommittal on the U.S. taking any kind of meaningful action on the issue and is a strong backer of the coal industry.\n\nHe\u2019s voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act, is a deeply conservative Christian who doesn\u2019t support same-sex marriage or the right of LGBTQ couples to adopt children, and in 2008 went on the record as being against affirmative in college admission. No.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue\n\nAs governor of Georgia from 2003 to 2011, Perdue\u2014who probably has this job because the president thought he was one of the chicken Perdues, which he is not\u2014displayed a number of Sessions-esque qualities: a nostalgia for the Confederacy, an appreciation of voter restrictions, and a fondness for immigration crackdowns of the sort he may recognize playing out nationally under this administration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy the rules of the transitive property, if Sessions can\u2019t be a good president for these reasons, than neither can Sonny Perdue.\n\n10. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe \u201cKing of Bankruptcy\u201d is a vulture capitalist who made a fortune buying up dying businesses. As reported earlier this year by The Nation and other outlets, a mine Ross\u2019s company acquired in West Virginia spent years accumulating workplace safety violations over the conditions faced by its non-union workforce. In 2006, 12 workers died after an explosion killed one person on impact and trapped several others in the mine. Management waited a full hour before calling for help, and it took nearly two days to reach the trapped miners. All but one of them had died by the time emergency workers arrived.\n\nIn terms of his politics, he likes tax cuts for the wealthy and doesn\u2019t like a healthcare law that brought the U.S. uninsured rate to an unprecedented low. He is also 1,000 years old and recently seemed very pleased to have not seen any protesters in Saudi Arabia, a nation that punishes dissent with beheadings.\n\n11. Labor Secretary Alex Acosta\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWho?\n\n\n\nOh.\n\nA Justice Department inspector general report on hiring practices at the Justice Department under George W. Bush also found Acosta, who was assistant attorney general of the department\u2019s Civil Rights Division, failed to \u201cexercise sufficient oversight\u201d while his deputy engaged in a politicized set of hiring practices meant to stack the department with conservative attorneys.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAttorneys hired by [Acosta deputy Brad] Schlozman were more than twice as likely to be Republican or conservative than those attorneys Scholzman was not involved in hiring,\u201d the report found.\n\nNo.\n\n12. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a representative for Georgia\u2019s 6th district, Price introduced a bill to replace the Affordable Care Act that made Paul Ryan\u2019s \u201cBetter Way\u201d plan look generous in comparison. He supports turning Medicare into a voucher system, is an anti-LGBTQ ideologue, and thinks it\u2019s reasonable for insurers to charge women more than men for coverage.\n\nBorrowing again from the rule of transitive Paul Ryan badness, Tom Price would not be a good president. QED.\n\n13. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDr. Carson feels he has no government experience, he\u2019s never run a federal agency,\u201d Ben Carson\u2019s adviser and friend Armstrong Williams told the Hill last year. \u201cThe last thing he would want to do was take a position that could cripple the presidency.\u201d\n\nThis applies just as well, presumably, to the presidency itself.\n\n14. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElaine Chao is ineligible because she isn\u2019t a natural born citizen.

Energy Secretary Rick Perry\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnergy Secretary Rick Perry is 15th in the line of succession and, like Tillerson, is an oil man with terrible politics. Perry is an anti-abortion and anti-LGBTQ ideologue who thoroughly gutted the reproductive health infrastructure of his state at the same time the maternal mortality rate doubled.\n\nHis experience as governor of Texas may help him more efficiently implement his political vision, to no one\u2019s benefit, though he also may be too stupid to effectively govern. He also had a racist summer home.\n\n16. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBetsy DeVos funneled Michigan children into charter schools while failing to improve the quality of their education. DeVos has such a bone-deep commitment to the unregulated expansion of charter schools that she eventually became a pariah even among school choice advocates, who tend to forgive the failings of their fellow \u201creformers.\u201d\n\nAn analysis of Michigan\u2019s charter schools conducted by the Detroit Free Press found that \u201c38% of charter schools that received state academic rankings during the 2012-13 school year fell below the 25th percentile, meaning at least 75% of all schools in the state performed better.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe most accurate assessment is that charter schools have simply created a second, privately managed failing system,\u201d Stephen Henderson, editorial page editor of the Detroit Free Press, wrote in December, pulling in years of the paper\u2019s reporting on educational outcomes in his analysis.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe education budget released this week by the Trump administration is a clear indication that she would like to recreate that failed experiment nationally, allocating $400 million to expand charter schools and vouchers for private and religious schools and setting aside another $1 billion to compel public schools to adopt choice policies.\n\nIt is a budget that hands public education a shovel and asks it to dig.\n\n\n\n17. Veteran Affairs Secretary David Shulkin\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs this our answer? David Shulkin was the last\u2014and probably least controversial\u2014Cabinet appointment made by Trump. Before joining this administration, he served as under secretary of Veterans Affairs for Health during the last two years of the Obama administration. Unlike several of Trump\u2019s other Cabinet appointees, he does not want to actively dismantle or privatize the department he oversees.\n\nIf we must choose someone from this administration to serve out the rest of Trump\u2019s term, Dr. Shulkin could probably do it without randomly starting a war or starving anyone.\n\nHe went to Hampshire College. Do people from Hampshire College start nuclear wars? I don\u2019t know. Is he \u201cgood\u201d by the standard defined above? I also don\u2019t know. Is he willing to sanitize the draconian outcomes of the president\u2019s preferred policies? Seems like it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRather than \u201cgood,\u201d let\u2019s call him a reversion to the mean of middle-of-the-road Democrats. This is certainly the best we could hope for in this lot, especially if you consider what Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, the last in the presidential line of succession, has been up to lately. So let\u2019s call it here.\n\nDavid Shulkin for president!

It was a triumph as epic as the film itself. But Panther isn\u2019t the only black-helmed film being released by Disney this winter; we are now only two weeks away from the release of A Wrinkle in Time, directed by Ava DuVernay.\n\nFeaturing Oprah, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Mindy Kaling, Reese Witherspoon and Chris Pine and starring newcomer Storm Reid as young heroine Meg Murry, A Wrinkle in Time is certain to serve up its own brand of black-girl movie magic on March 9. And along with all of you avid filmgoers, we especially think our girls should be there to see it.\n\nEnter the \u201cA Wrinkle in Time Challenge\u201d (#AWITChallenge): an initiative to buy out eight theaters in cities around the country\u2014Austin, Texas; Charlotte, N.C.; Chicago; Greensboro, N.C.; Houston; Philadelphia; Plainfield, N.J.; and Washington, D.C.\u2014for black girls (and nonboys) to see the film on opening weekend.\n\nCoordinated by the online group Sisters in the Storm, \u201ca collective of black women focused on community engagement and Sisterhood among black women & non-men,\u201d a GoFundMe page has been created with the aim of raising $25,000, reaching nearly half their goal in the past 10 days, with just under a week left to go. But behind their valiant mission is a heartbreaking story, as co-founder Sherronda J. Brown explains in an essay at Medium:\n\nIn late January, a black girl named Stormiyah Denson-Jackson passed away in an apparent suicide at the public boarding school she attended. She was twelve years old and already madly in love with math and science\u2014a #RealMeg. But this love she had made her the target of bullying and verbal abuse from her classmates. Devastated by their taunts, she chose to end her life rather than live with the shame they tried to make her feel for being a \u201cnerd\u201d who enjoyed engaging with sciences and mathematics. There is a narrow image of blackness in the social imagination, mired with stereotypes and white ascendant ideals about black intellect, capability, and mobility. For black women and girls, beliefs, about our blackness\u2014how it is allowed to look, what it is allowed to achieve\u2014can never be divorced from beliefs about our gender. There is a social stigma about challenging these expectations and permissions, and it constantly impacts our experiences in the world, but never more significantly than when we are growing up, learning who we are, and deciding who we want to become.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike the momentum that grew around the #BlackPantherChallenge, raising over $620,000 from all 50 states to make it possible for black children to see themselves reflected on film, Sisters of the Storm\u2019s act of love and generosity is inspiring others to do the same for the #AWITChallenge. For instance, writer and Lemonade Syllabus creator Candice Benbow has set her own goal to make A Wrinkle in Time accessible to 200 girls in Hamilton, N.J. As she told The Glow Up, it\u2019s a gift she hopes to make in memory of her mother:\n\nI wanted to ensure that we do our part to support Ava and this film just like we supported Ryan Coogler and Black Panther. But also, my mom took me to the library every Friday, and would take me to the movies whenever something came out for kids. This movie and the moment around it reminds me of my childhood and time with my mother. I wanted to honor that by participating in this challenge so black girls today can look back on similar memories and smile. What Ava has done with this film made history, and black girls need to see that there is no dream too big for them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe have seen firsthand the impact that seeing black superheroes on film can have on our children\u2014and ourselves. With A Wrinkle in Time, we also have yet another opportunity\u2014and plenty of incentive\u2014to show Hollywood that blockbusters star black people, too.\n\nBut for real-life Meg Murrys, or Shuris, or other struggling Stormiyah Denson-Jacksons, A Wrinkle in Time may also provide exactly the affirmation and inspiration they need to flourish as their brilliant, STEM-loving, \u201cblack girl nerd\u201d selves. As Brown wrote: \u201cSeeing ourselves represented as heroes has undeniable power, and feeling our absence in these roles also influences the way that we see ourselves and our blackness.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s do it again, y\u2019all.\n\nThe Glow Up tip: A Wrinkle in Time opens in theaters on Friday, March 9. You can support Sisters in the Storm\u2019s $25,000 #AWITChallenge via its GoFundMe page until March 1. You can also spend $20 to sponsor a black girl to see the film in Hamilton, N.J., via Candice Benbow\u2019s website. Or begin your own challenge locally.

Maybe that\u2019s why he\u2019s been so nimble at dressing die-hard fans like EGOT Whoopi Goldberg, who sat front-row at his show Saturday, along with rap \u201cit\u201d girl Cardi B, dressed head to toe in a money-green suit with a white mink stole tossed over her shoulder for good measure. Both were there to applaud the 10th year of his superluxe ready-to-wear collection.\n\nBut Siriano\u2019s work just isn\u2019t for the rich and famous; we can all walk in designer shoes from the collection he personally designs for Payless, or slide into a sheath from his ongoing collaboration with plus-size retailer Lane Bryant.

When you\u2019re illustrating the complexities of racial prejudice in America, it is difficult to bridge the gap between understanding and skepticism in a populace pretending to listen with its arms folded, ready to dismiss any reasonable, salient point that demonstrates the existence of privilege and bigotry. Sometimes it\u2019s not that people don\u2019t believe racism exists; rather, it\u2019s difficult to provide examples that are clear-cut and easy to understand.\n\nBut not today.\n\nLast week, after President Don \u201cPuffy\u201d Comb-Over claimed on Twitter that his predecessor had wiretapped his phones, Republican lawmakers, having seen no evidence or proof, vowed to investigate. On Monday they began seeking proof of his charges. Even though Donald Trump offered no substance to his charges, they still promised to examine them, understanding that if they were true, it meant one of two things:\n\nEither Barack Obama slithered into his Magical Negro Spider-Man suit, slithered out of the White House, slipped unnoticed into midtown Manhattan and scaled Trump Tower to personally plant listening devices, or the Federal Intelligence Surveillance Court determined that there was sufficient evidence to listen in on Trump and issued a warrant to intelligence or law-enforcement agents. If the federal government was listening to Trump\u2019s calls, one of those two things had to happen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet the entire House of Representatives and the Senate, along with federal investigators, the Justice Department, the intelligence community and every other person in the executive branch of the U.S. government, sat on their hands and zipped their lips while Trump accused the former president of the United States of a felony. Lawmakers didn\u2019t just look the other way; they promised to look into the claim\u2014even though they knew it was a lie. By taking this stance, even though they are quite aware that it is impossible to prove a negative\u2014that Obama didn\u2019t tap Trump\u2019s gold rotary desktop telephone\u2014they all tacitly acknowledged that Obama might be a criminal.\n\nBut Obama is black, and black people are used to this.\n\nTrump\u2019s claims do not just exist in the over-the-shoulder reminiscences of yesteryear. They are the latest example, in a number of recent reminders, of how offhand, unsubstantiated accusations against black people in America are so easily accepted, resulting in character assassination and sometimes death.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExample: This weekend, two and-a-half years after Michael Brown was gunned down in Ferguson, Mo., surveillance footage emerged that seemed to show Brown exchanging what appears to be marijuana with store clerks minutes before now-former Police Officer Darren Wilson killed him.\n\nThis is significant because the narrative of this case was always that Brown went to a corner store and stole a pack of cigarillos. Minutes later, according to the narrative, Wilson encountered Brown\u2014a \u201chulk\u201d of a man whose adrenaline was pumping after he supposedly committed a forceful, brazen robbery\u2014who grabbed the officer\u2019s gun.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was easy for prosecutors, a grand jury, conservative voices and the media as a whole to rationalize Brown\u2019s death given the \u201cfacts.\u201d It was believable that a young man who would strong-arm cashiers and loot a business in broad daylight would also be reckless enough to grab a cop\u2019s gun. A policeman should rightfully fear for his life in the presence of such a menace.\n\nExcept that none of it appears to be true. Even without sound, the new video shows what appears to be an illegal but reciprocal exchange. Brown lays a baggie on the counter, and the store clerks pick it up, examines it and holds up a pack of cigars in exchange. Brown never retrieves the bag but gives back the cigarillos. Investigators had this evidence but never presented it, now saying that it is \u201cirrelevant to our investigation.\u201d Even with this new footage, it is unlikely that anyone will ever pay for Brown\u2019s death.\n\nExample: Feb. 26 marked the fifth anniversary of the death of Trayvon Martin, the fifth anniversary of when George Zimmerman shot an unarmed 17-year-old who had committed no crime. Police initially declined to arrest Zimmerman because he told investigators that he shot Trayvon in self-defense after Trayvon fought with him and grabbed his gun. A jury acquitted Zimmerman, even though 911 operators asked him not to follow Trayvon; even after analysis found none of Zimmerman\u2019s DNA under Trayvon\u2019s fingernails following a supposed fight; and despite the fact that Zimmerman\u2019s gun did not have Trayvon\u2019s fingerprints on it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Zimmerman said that Trayvon was the aggressor, so he wasn\u2019t arrested until 44 days after he shot the teenager. A jury found Zimmerman not guilty because his shooting of Trayvon in the chest was \u201cnecessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm.\u201d Zimmerman said it; therefore it was true. Trayvon is dead because of one person, but no one will ever pay for his death.\n\nExample: Carolyn Bryant, the woman who accused 13-year-old Emmett Till of whistling at her, resulting in his gruesome 1955 death, recently admitted that she made the whole thing up. Bryant chose to wait 62 years after Emmett\u2019s family laid him to rest, and a lifetime after her husband and his accomplice confessed to the murder in Look magazine for $3,000. She outwaited a 2004 Justice Department reinvestigation of the crime. No one ever paid for the murder of Emmett Till because of one person. Emmett is dead because of one person\u2019s statement.\n\nMedia outlets, congress members and senators for weeks have discussed Trump\u2019s bromance with Russian President Vladimir Putin. It is no longer speculation; it is fact. Trump\u2019s campaign managers, now-former national security adviser, secretary of state and attorney general, as well as other members of his staff, all have verifiable ties to the Russian government, but to date, there hasn\u2019t been a single real investigation. But as soon as the dimwitted despot tweeted that the black president had violated the rules, everyone was quick to say, \u201cLet\u2019s take a look at this.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s the way this country has always worked. Demonizing black men is as American as \u201cstrange fruit\u201d-flavored pie. It is easy to condemn the long history of lynchings while pardoning and turning a blind eye to the people who point the fingers that led to nooses around necks. The way Republican lawmakers grabbed their Sherlock Holmes hats after Trump offhandedly accused the only scandal-free president of our lifetime of a federal crime is indicative of the fact that only some people are innocent until proved guilty.\n\nThat\u2019s why a man 50 pounds heavier and 11 years older than a teenager with a pocket full of candy could shoot the boy in the chest and claim that he did it in self-defense. It\u2019s how the Ferguson police, prosecutors and news outlets convinced us that 6-foot-4 Mike Brown was terrorizing his neighborhood like a rabid dog, intimidating and grabbing the weapon of the mild-mannered, elfin, 6-foot-4 Darren Wilson. It\u2019s why the world disregarded Carolyn Bryant\u2019s bloodstained hands for a half a century while Emmett Till\u2019s family still screams for justice.\n\nThis is what it means to be black in America.\n\nPure innocence is not enough to keep your head from being smashed with an anvil and your body wrapped in barbed wire. \u201cDo not talk to strangers\u201d is an inadequate safety message when a man can stalk your son and shoot him in the chest, and people will eagerly bid hundreds of thousands of dollars for the gun that did it. Even a heralded black man with a reputation so spotless that he somehow becomes the leader of the free world is still lesser than a white, imbecilic, dishonest dictator-in-training. Imagine how scary it must be to live in a world where you can be undone by any words uttered from a white mouth\u2014even if they aren\u2019t true.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaybe we shouldn\u2019t point out the effects of unfounded white accusations against black bodies. Instead, we will make a universal blanket proclamation that encompasses all of these incidents, hoping that our inclusive statement will cause some people to hear the words we have been too long shouting at our dear America:\n\nAll lies matter.", "keywords": ["trumps", "martin", "zimmerman", "mike", "president", "white", "till", "trump", "trayvon", "brown", "emmett", "obama", "black", "tweets", "man", "teach"], "polarity": 0.005504046354561809, "subjectivity": 0.4822140774460359},

As Bethune-Cookman University graduates loudly booed U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos during her remarks at the school\u2019s commencement ceremony Wednesday morning, university President Edison Jackson threatened to withhold their degrees.\n\n\u201cIf this behavior continues,\u201d Jackson said angrily as DeVos uncomfortably stood beside him with a smile frozen on her face, \u201cyour degrees will be mailed to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cChoose which way you want to go,\u201d Jackson warned.\n\nThe students ignored Jackson\u2019s threats and continued to boo DeVos. Some even stood with their backs to her, fists raised in the air as she continued her speech.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Florida chapter of the NAACP anticipated Jackson\u2019s actions in a statement released Monday that called for his immediate resignation and that of Board Chairman Joe Petrock.\n\n\u201cSince our initial public outcry last week, multiple allegations have surfaced including faculty intimidation demanding their silence or risk termination and threats to students by potentially withholding earned degrees and fines for freedom of expression,\u201d the statement read. \u201cIf these allegations are proven, this contrasts the public statements of university administration who opposes suppressing voices by welcoming U.S. Education Secretary DeVos but lends indirect support to these actions against faculty and students.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany people with common sense questioned the choice of DeVos for commencement speaker, especially in light of her comments earlier this year when she referred to HBCUs as \u201cpioneers\u201d in school choice and said that they gave black students more options to pursue higher education.\n\n\n\nWith that being said, it is still entirely puzzling why anyone thought that not only inviting DeVos to the commencement ceremony but also honoring her would be a good idea. However, Jackson\u2019s attendance at a meeting with President Donald Trump in February, along with dozens of other HBCU leaders, may provide the answers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI truly believe that meaningful progress for our schools requires relationships,\u201d said Jackson in a statement published on Bethune-Cookman\u2019s website following the meeting. \u201cHBCUs must have a voice in Washington. We must do all that we can to ensure the success of our colleges and universities.

The university leadership has drastically fumbled and should resign,\u201d Nweze said.\n\n\n\nWhatever the reason behind Jackson\u2019s decision to invite an enemy of HBCUs into the students\u2019 midst, I was entirely pleased with all the videos that came down the Twitter timeline showing them resisting.", "keywords": ["jacksons", "students", "naacp", "president", "secretary", "withhold", "boos", "bethunecookman", "threatens", "hbcus", "betsy", "university", "devos", "statement", "degrees", "jackson", "loud"], "polarity": 0.04875116713352007, "subjectivity": 0.49589169000933697},

And then you wonder why we have a problem. That\u2019s why we have a problem. And I don\u2019t think we should play games. Now, I never did polling on that. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s popular. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s unpopular.

Congrats!\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s say you just started a new job, or maybe your kid made a new friend at school, or perhaps some black people even just moved into your neighborhood, and now you want to make nice with them. Cool. You\u2019re trying to make friends with black people, but you\u2019ve never really made friends with black people. I mean, you\u2019ve known some black people throughout your life, but never enough to really call them \u201cfriends.\u201d\n\nBut these black people, they\u2019re different. You feel a kinship, a connection, a bond. You feel like you want to really get to know them, have them be a part of your life and truly open up to them.\n\nHow do you do it?\n\n\n\nHow do you cross the uncomfortable divide of race and culture and make a genuine connection with your new black friend (hopefully) without it getting weird?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWorry not, because we\u2019re here to help. For you as a not-black person trying to ingratiate yourself with the soul and get you properly down with the browns. If you are black, you can print this out for your new white friends as a quick read to help cultivate your burgeoning friendship.\n\nI wonder if they know the other black person that I know; should I ask them?\n\nProbably not, for two reasons. The first being that it\u2019s a dead giveaway that you do not know many black people, if any, and that you have no idea just how many black people there are (hint: There are 47 million of us in America). Second, it\u2019s a weak way to start up a conversation, and it lets us know you assume that we don\u2019t have any other mutual interests beyond, well, beyond the fact that we both know some black people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSurprisingly, you\u2019ve got a lot more in common with the black folks around you than you think. We all eat food, we all got families and we all watch Game of Thrones (yo, black people love some Thrones, y\u2019all). So start there instead of dragging Sheila from accounts payable at your old job into this relationship.\n\n(Sidenote: We think we know Sheila, though. I mean, we probably do. She sounds mad familiar, but don\u2019t just jump to conclusions about that shit, man. It\u2019s not cool.)\n\n\n\nShould I tell them about the black person I dated briefly in college?\n\nPlease don\u2019t.\n\nDo we have to talk about race all the time?\n\nIf it makes you uncomfortable, yes. Yes, we do, for that reason.\n\nDid you watch that O.J. Simpson 30 for 30 documentary?\n\nHell yeah! That shit was great. Man, there hasn\u2019t been an exploration into the intersections of race, class, celebrity and the fault lines of the criminal-justice system like that in the history of television.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI mean, white people who like The Wire get props in our book, but if you actually watched that O.J. doc and really and genuinely walked away from it with some informed understanding of how African Americans view the police and our historic relationship with law enforcement, then more power to you. That\u2019s worth a solid fist bump with a lower lip bite, homey.\n\nSee, THAT\u2019S how you let us know where you stand on things. Don\u2019t just come at O.J. like he was some kind of savage or unrepentant murderer who just indiscriminately killed people on a whim. There\u2019s a whole story there.\n\nBut do you think that O.J. did it?\n\nOh yeah, he totally did that shit.\n\nI voted for Trump. How do I talk about this with my new black friend?\n\nNah.\n\nDon\u2019t.\n\nYou\u2019re probably not ready for a black friend right now. Just back away from black people and deal with your own shit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo everyone who voted for Trump is a racist?\n\nIf you aren\u2019t, then you\u2019re OK with racism. You were cool with the prospect of racism perniciously impacting people you now want to call friends. Racist shit wasn\u2019t a disqualifying factor for you, sooooo \u2026\n\nI\u2019m having a dinner party at my house. What should I ask them to bring?\n\nMacaroni and cheese. Trust me. Black people excel in the macaroni arts. That or potato salad if you plan on having it served. Otherwise, we won\u2019t eat the potato salad, and your macaroni game is gonna come up short.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlay to your black friend\u2019s strengths. In fact, you should plan the meal in anticipation of some bomb-ass macaroni and work from there. If your new black friend makes shitty macaroni, chances are they don\u2019t have many black friends, either, and y\u2019all were never gonna work out anyway.\n\nThey\u2019ve invited me over to a barbecue. What should I bring?\n\nThis one\u2019s dicey because, in your mind, you\u2019re probably thinking that you should answer their call as if it\u2019s some kind of cultural exchange where you\u2019ll have some of their native dishes and you\u2019ll bring one of yours in kind.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t do that.\n\nWhen it comes to how the food is seasoned, prepared, cooked and presented, you gotta really have a thorough understanding of the black folks you\u2019re dealing with before you just start showing up with random shit. Is this a pork house or a nonpork house? Are they cool with coleslaw? Is this a Hennessy or a Remy family? Too many variables, man. Don\u2019t chance it. Besides, they\u2019re going to ask you to bring a nonperishable item to keep it simple for you, so chances are you\u2019re getting plates anyway.\n\n\n\nBut if you do start feeling inspired and want to make your Oma\u2019s special-recipe green-bean-and-wheat salad, stop. Don\u2019t bring that shit. No one\u2019s gonna touch it because we\u2019re not that polite.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNext thing you know, the party\u2019s over and there\u2019s a whole uneaten casserole sitting on the counter and you done hurt your own feelings. Just bring cups and napkins. Black folks love napkins. You can never go wrong with napkins \u2026 or ice, \u2019cause we know Marvin an\u2019nem always forget that shit.\n\nWhen do I get to use the n-word?\n\nNever. The answer is never. Not even if you stay friends for the next 55 years and find yourselves sitting next to each other in the home whilst Wu-Tang plays in the background of your bingo game. It\u2019s \u201cShame on a nuh\u201d for you forever. Forever.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you want to keep your black friend, don\u2019t ever use that word.\n\nI don\u2019t see race, so why should I treat my black friend(s) any differently?\n\nSee, that\u2019s where you fucked up from the jump. Anybody who cops the \u201cI don\u2019t see race\u201d plea is immediately suspect to all black people. Saying that you don\u2019t see race is essentially admitting that you\u2019re so willing to deny your own biases that you\u2019ll revoke part of someone else\u2019s identity to make you feel better about your inadequacies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t believe me? Allow me to put it another way.\n\nWould you trust a doctor who said they didn\u2019t see or believe in cancer? Hell nah, you wouldn\u2019t.

I've read several articles about this because I've honestly been trying to understand and what I've come up with is that there is no understanding to be had. Why an HBCU would chose to pick a member of Trump's administration so aggressively hostile towards minority communities and, frankly, actual education, is beyond me.\n\nI don't know if common sense is on vacation, and recent ads for damn near everything insinuate that to the be the case, but an actual Black institution of higher learning taking such a transparent stance towards ass kissing is embarrassing. That is the only plausible reason why anybody from this administration would be asked, especially Betsy DeVos, a woman who released an ENTIRE press release that explicitly outlined her lack of knowledge about why HBCUs even exist.\n\nLet her come to the school to sit down and be educated. Giving her the country to come and speak to a legion of new graduates is tone deaf in a way that would be impressive if it wasn't so sad.\n\nBut not quite as sad as this shit:\n\nIn a news release Monday, the university said: \u201cMuch like Dr. Bethune, Founder of Bethune-Cookman University, Secretary DeVos deems the importance of opportunity and hope for students to receive an exceptional education experience. Her mission to empower parents and students resonates with the history and legacy of Dr. Bethune.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoy stop. Mary McLeod Bethune probably sat up in her grave at the comparison. Also, shit, you could say that about ANYBODY who believes good schooling is a win. There are people who HATE school who are like, \"I mean, if you're gonna have school, it is important for opportunity and hope and shit.\" Jaden Smith would agree with that and I think he's viewed school as some sort of telepathic bridge to nowhere since he was like four. In that case, Mary McLeod Bethune and Jaden Smith\u2026same shit.\n\nI will extend some grace, Lord knows we all need it, and assume that BC did this for some reason that belies logic BUT was done with pure altruism at heart. Maybe Betsy said that she'd promise them a new, I don't know, research center if they'd let her come speak because nobody else wants to hear shit she has to say. I have no clue. And statements like this, \"The release also noted the importance of funding from the Education Department, and praised DeVos for her charitable contributions\" somewhat alludes to SOMETHING along those lines.\n\nWhile there are way worse individuals to have come speak to your institution - Richard Spencer, Steve Bannon, Donald Trump, Sean Spicer, Kellyanne Conway, Ben Casron, etc. all immediately come to mind\u2026you know what, Ben Carson shouldn't be an option but if you HAVE to pick somebody from the administration at least he DID positively impact the world at some point and is Black even if his relationship with what slavery actually was is tenuous. He pretty much lit his entire pre-political career on fire, but I'm saying, if we ARE extending invites and shit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEither way, Bethune-Cookman University should be ashamed. Yes, this will be a non-thing in a few weeks. Nobody is coming from far and wide to hear her speak. And it also seems like her speaking is going to happen no matter what petitions or protests exist. Plus, are you going to skip out on your graduation because of the speaker? I think not. Perhaps a flash mob style insertion of ear plugs when she started speaking could be an effective tool of silent protest. Yo no se.\n\nThen again, my alma mater has Van Jones speaking and I guess he can't stop stepping in shit either though I'd imagine the weight of sensibility is weighing pretty heavily in Morehouse's favor in comparison.

Not because her distinct sound of music sounded as if one of God\u2019s angels drank a fifth of gin and figured out a way to plug an extension cord into its harp. It wasn\u2019t because I was listening to something that was recorded in the 1930s that sounded like Prince had laid it down in a studio yesterday.\n\nIt was the erasure.\n\nBecause not finding out about Sister Rosetta Tharpe\u2019s existence until my third decade on the planet meant everything could be a lie. If an intentional omission can delete an entire human being from history, then nothing means anything.\n\nThe title of this article is not hyperbole. It is truth. It is an indisputable fact.\n\nInvent: (verb) to create or design (something that has not existed before)\n\nIt is as simple as this: What we know as rock \u2019n\u2019 roll did not exist before Sister Rosetta Tharpe. She came before Elvis and Johnny Cash. She preceded Chuck Berry and Little Richard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen most music historians are asked who invented this class of music, many will name one of the previously mentioned rock stars. The most respectful and thoughtful will say it was a combination of these men.\n\nBut every single one of those men, including Little Richard, will tell you that the first person from whom they heard the sound with which we have become familiar was Rosetta Tharpe.\n\nIn his induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Johnny Cash said that she was his favorite singer growing up. Little Richard called her his greatest influence. Chuck Berry said that his entire career was just \u201cone long Rosetta Tharpe impersonation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA PBS documentary on her life called her the \u201cgodmother of rock and roll.\u201d She is still called the \u201cforgotten mother\u201d of the genre and \u201cthe most influential artist ever.\u201d\n\nMaybe she is overlooked because she was technically a gospel singer (because rock didn\u2019t exist yet, remember?). Perhaps Tharpe\u2019s blackness has something to do with the fact that she wasn\u2019t elected to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame until 2017. Or her queerness. Or the fact that she was a woman.\n\nMusic authorities argue about a handful of songs recorded between 1946 and 1952 when discussing what might be the first rock \u2019n\u2019 roll song ever, the most popular of which is \u201cRocket 88\u201d by Jackie Brenston and His Delta Cats, recorded in 1952.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Oct. 31, 1938, when Elvis was 3 years old, when Chuck Berry was 12, when Little Richard (who is rarely disputed when he says he \u201cinvented\u201d rock \u2019n\u2019 roll) was 6 years old, and when Jackie Brenston and His Delta Cats were still kittens, Sister Rosetta Tharpe recorded this song for posterity:\n\n\u201cMusic authorities\u201d are a motherfucking lie.\n\nOnce more, for the people in the back: Sister Rosetta Tharpe invented rock \u2019n\u2019 roll.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRosetta Nubin was born in 1915 in Cotton Plant, Ark. By the time she was 6 years old, she was performing in churches around the South with her mother. After moving to Chicago as a child, Rosetta married a Church of God in Christ preacher named Thomas Tharpe after she became a renowned gospel musician in the COGIC community. Rosetta would divorce her husband after a few years, but she kept the surname as her stage moniker.\n\nDuring a time when the idea of a guitar-playing woman was nonexistent, not only did Rosetta Tharpe erase this line by mastering the symbol of musical masculinity, but her blend of gospel and secular music was seen as earth-shattering. Her willingness to play \u201cGod\u2019s music\u201d in the devil\u2019s den of nightclubs and music halls caused an uproar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter a move to New York, she began playing with some of the biggest bands in the country, including Duke Ellington\u2019s. By the time she was 23, she had a recording contract, and recorded Decca Record\u2019s first gospel songs in 1938, including the hit song \u201cRock Me.\u201d\n\nWhen people heard her music, Tharpe became an overnight sensation, and her music became the first gospel music to ever top Billboard\u2019s \u201crace\u201d charts, an accomplishment she achieved several times during her career. People often commented that she \u201cplayed like a man,\u201d to which Tharpe often replied: \u201cCan\u2019t no man play like me. I play better than a man.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though she was playing venues like Carnegie Hall and the Cotton Club with legendary acts such as Cab Calloway, Tharpe longed to get back to the gospel music circuit. After meeting gospel singer Marie Knight in 1946, Tharpe entered into a relationship with Knight and lived openly in the relationship until it ended in 1951.\n\nWith the move to folk music and the British invasion that rejuvenated musicians of her era in the 1960s and 1970s, Tharpe didn\u2019t get the same bump that male blues musicians did because she continued to stick to gospel-themed music. She died during a recording session on Oct. 9, 1973, when she suffered her second stroke.\n\nSister Rosetta Tharpe was not an unknown, hidden little secret. She was such a huge star, she had her third wedding in a stadium where 25,000 people attended. Yet she was somehow erased from the history of music.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost reasonable music historians will tell you that one person shouldn\u2019t receive credit for an entire genre. While it is true that not every single musician who ever played rock \u2019n\u2019 roll was inspired by Rosetta Tharpe, it is also true that there is not a single rock musician playing in the year 2018 doing something that Rosetta Tharpe wasn\u2019t doing 80 years ago.\n\nShe did it first.\n\nThat\u2019s what \u201cinvent\u201d means.", "keywords": ["n", "queer", "invented", "sister", "rock", "little", "gospel", "music", "tharpe", "recorded", "roll", "woman", "black", "rosetta"], "polarity": 0.1496963272648204, "subjectivity": 0.41634841566348413},

At least that\u2019s the conclusion of \u201cWhy It\u2019s Hard for Conservatives to Date in D.C. Right Now,\u201d a piece in The Washingtonian magazine that\u2019s become all the talk in Washington circles this week. Or at least some Washington circles.\n\nConservatives (mostly men) in the article lament that D.C. liberals would rather swipe left than settle in for a night of Tucker Carlson and chill. The dating deficit isn\u2019t just affecting the men, though. Conservative women who\u2019ve swarmed D.C. since Donald Trump got into office are forced to alter their dating choices, too. From The Washingtonian:\n\n\n\nConversely, a young White House staffer says she typically looks for someone from the South when swiping through profiles, as she thinks they\u2019ll be more receptive to her support of the President.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: She\u2019s looking for a white guy from the South. I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s not on BlackSinglesMeet.com scrolling for alumni from FAMU. Which got me thinking: Are black conservatives having the same dating problems as white conservatives in D.C.? Is there some lonely black Republican guy out there wondering why Lisa, Angela, Pamela and Renee never responded to his Diamond and Silk Chit Chat Live Evite? Is there some black Republican woman out there trying to turn men\u2019s heads who\u2019s frustrated because everyone thinks her \u201cLock Her Up\u201d T-shirt is advertising a new spot on 14th Street to get their braids done? I took an unofficial survey of every black Republican I know to get to the bottom of this mystery.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nObviously, this polling has some limitations\u2014most of the black Republicans I know are already married, and it was hard finding LGBT black Republicans. I know a few, but to this day, I have yet to meet a black lesbian Republican. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re out there, riding unicorns and paying for Janelle Mon\u00e1e tickets with four-leaf clovers dipped in vibranium, but I couldn\u2019t find any before deadline.\n\nThe vast majority of people I spoke to said that being a conservative or a Republican didn\u2019t hurt their D.C. dating prospects at all. If anything, it may have helped. The people I spoke to agreed to share their stories on the condition that their identities be kept secret. So The Root promised to be one of the few outlets in D.C. that WON\u2019T leak Republican testimony.\n\n\u201cMy boys introduce me as \u2018That\u2019s my Republican friend,\u2019 and women are, like, intrigued,\u201d said one prominent GOP state party member in his late 40s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI know Republicans who get play, and I know some that are wack,\u201d said a Gen X Republican married to a woman who worked on former President Barack Obama\u2019s campaign. \u201cI mean, most folks don\u2019t bang with 45 like that, so if that\u2019s how you start and end every conversation, what do you expect?\u201d\n\nThe emerging theme was that being a black Republican wasn\u2019t as big a problem so long as:\n\nYou focused on the black part.\n\nYou weren\u2019t a Trump-supporting black person.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never been a problem for me,\u201d a millennial black Republican who works in media said. \u201cI mean, my girlfriend knows I\u2019m a black man. She knows that the lens through which I live my conservative politics is as a black man. Besides, her momma said, \u2018As long as he isn\u2019t one of those TRUMP conservatives,\u2019 and I definitely am not!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve dated lots of men I don\u2019t agree with,\u201d said a 40-something black woman who works as a newspaper editor. \u201cBut Trump supporters are assholes!\u201d She noted that a co-worker set her up with a Trumper about a year ago.\n\n\u201cHe was very handsome, successful, but so arrogant,\u201d she said. \u201cHe went on and on about how journalists should be locked up and how immigrants are ruining America.\u201d Clearly lapsing into the worst date of her life, \u201cAnd you know the worst part? He was a Jamaican immigrant!\u201d\n\nA lot of what I was hearing spoke to the way that black folks navigate \u201cparty\u201d politics versus universal issues when it comes to dating and mating. For many, being a Republican is like a form of code-switching, and potential dates accept that, but \u201cTrumpism\u201d is a lifestyle choice that will get you no love. I swear on a stack of secondhand copies of Gifted Hands that most black men and women in Washington would go on a date with a small-government, lower-taxes, pro-life potential bae, and even listen to some shading of Obama, but there are limits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI went on a few dates with a black Republican soon after I moved to D.C. Everything was cool until we started talking about Black Lives Matter and she turned into Stacey Dash. Not the \u201cAll Falls Down\u201d Stacey Dash, but Fox News, \u201cWe should cancel Black History Month and I hate BET even though I used to twerk in their videos,\u201d hypocritical Stacey Dash.\n\nI think this woman found political debates to be sexy, but by the time she was explaining why black folks shouldn\u2019t be given access to police dashcam and bodycam video because we\u2019d \u201cjust go crazy and riot,\u201d it was a wrap. I wanted to just give her a prepaid Metro card back to the sunken place, but I was too much of a gentleman; and besides, she probably would have liked it.\n\nMy extensive survey and lab work could only lead to one conclusion: Conservative white, Trump-loving people must suck at dating in D.C., because black conservatives aren\u2019t having these problems. Also, this isn\u2019t just a Trump issue; Breitbart complained about the same thing during the Obama administration, and Tomi Lahren\u2019s living Dorian Gray painting, Ann Coulter, said the same thing under Bush.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo why a whole article about it? What would compel a few \u201cMAGA\u201d-hat-wearing men and women to whine to The Washingtonian that their weekends are as empty as a Trump Christmas party?\n\n\u201cThat was just some \u2018woe is me\u2019 white-boy stuff right there,\u201d said the GOP state official. \u201cThey think they\u2019re entitled, but look, you enabled this guy [Trump]; you\u2019re complicit in what this country is going through. Why should anybody throw you the box?\u201d\n\nNever fear, though, young white conservatives. There are still some options for the less-than-discerning, Trump-supporting D.C. dater. Just know that the first 20 minutes might cost you about $130,000, but you definitely won\u2019t be judged for riding the Trump train.", "keywords": ["conservatives", "women", "men", "fine", "know", "white", "dc", "ones", "tucker", "carlson", "republican", "trump", "dating", "date", "chill", "doing", "black"], "polarity": -0.026833694083694067, "subjectivity": 0.4630097402597401},

Or would there be some trumped-up excuse about masturbation or cookies to keep O.J. locked up? My guess is that they still love him so.\n\n\n\nO.J. was always different, right? It wasn\u2019t as if he wasn\u2019t a football gawd. Or extremely handsome. Or a friend forever to wypipo\u2014that cool, talented fool who fit right in.\n\nI remember the day the O.J. verdict came down in 1995. Swear to God, all the eggs I cracked that morning had two yolks (and you know I kept cracking them all because I was a little distressed about this weirdness). Then, up on the 20th floor, a pigeon flew in my apartment\u2014that means death, according to the old folks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI still didn\u2019t think he did it.\n\nWhen I got to my job at The Source that day, we all crowded around a conference-room TV for the announcement. There were cheers and weed smoke.\n\nGiven the police and their interaction with black communities across the country, it seemed highly plausible to all of us that O.J. was set up. The entrenched racism of the Los Angeles Police Department had surely blinded me to Nicole Brown Simpson\u2019s murder, but the truth was, it was almost immaterial. The entire thing had moved way, way beyond that. It had gone tribal, to use a jail metaphor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI credit Ezra Edelman and his seminal O.J.: Made in America documentary for giving me empathy for Brown Simpson. As noted in his The Root 100 bio last year:\n\nMade in America took one of the most specific, racially divisive trials of the 20th century and expanded its lens beyond Simpson and onto celebrity, criminal justice, race and gender in Los Angeles. Not only that, Edelman was able to present a work that helped those on both sides of the fence see the \u201cother\u2019s\u201d perspective\u2014 art as a bridge over the still-gaping racial divide in this country.\n\nThe feminist part of me hated that crazy motherfucker for abusing that poor woman and most likely ending her life in a most horrific way. But O.J. was more than a violent black man. He was a living representation of a criminal-justice system that has doled out relentless travesty to African Americans since time immemorial (\u201cTwo for 2 million?\u201d is how one black woman put it).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIntersectionality is rarely neat.\n\nI\u2019m over it. O.J. is nothing but spectacle, and we have quite enough of that in reality. What\u2019s next? O.J. Simpson endorses Donald Trump? O.J. gets in a ring with Trump after he\u2019s impeached? The whites pay O.J. to be in a real-life The Most Dangerous Game? You heard it here first.\n\nHopefully, O.J. will fade into the ether and go sit the fuck down somewhere, happy that he did only nine years for murder.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd to the two women who owe me my Hamilton ... run it.

Why would a woman as talented and ambitious as Horton settle for that?\n\nTo date, she\u2019s already held posts as the New York Times\u2019 marketing director for luxury brands, tasked with bringing in new revenue streams for the newspaper. She was also executive director of creative services and communications at American Vogue, overseeing a team dedicated to promotions, events and all client advertising, and was head of global communications at Shopbop (owned by Amazon.com), with responsibility for the development and execution of Shopbop\u2019s global communications and public relations strategy.\n\nFrom Horton\u2019s eagle-eye vantage point, it appears that we have only begun to glimpse the potential for customizing the client experience and for maximizing the profitability of digital luxury marketing. Horton is on a trajectory to reach the apex of the fashion business, and she\u2019s not going alone: Today marks the launch of Fashion Tech Connects, a nonprofit dedicated to mentoring the next generation of black and brown women hoping to reach fashion\u2019s highest executive ranks.\n\nHow does she do it? It\u2019s all in a stylish day\u2019s work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen The Glow Up caught up with Horton, it was an early workday morning, featuring front-page fashion news: Horton and the board members of Alexander Wang had decided to break away from New York Fashion Week, a trending marketing move in the design community, Horton says. It\u2019s exciting because \u201ctechnology lets you break rules and frees designers up to do what\u2019s best for their business.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s best for business right now, and one of the biggest lessons learned from her term at Shopbop, is that all technological innovation needs to be \u201coutward facing\u201d and to \u201cserve the customer, and add to the bottom line.\u201d\n\nAccording to Horton, \u201ckitschy innovation\u201d in business (akin to attention grabs on social media or kooky in-store experiences that don\u2019t ring at the register) is a no-no.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot going on in AI [artificial intelligence] as it relates to CRM [customer relationship management] that helps me hone and practice my craft,\u201d Horton says.\n\nSo how exactly did Horton, 46, whose luxurious, honey-blond locks are every bit as bright and sunny as her disposition, emerge from The Devil Wears Prada corporate crucible at Vogue to become one of the most powerful African-American female C-suite execs in the global fashion trade?\n\n\u201cVogue is a performance-based culture. You have to come up with ideas, push them through and deliver at pace,\u201d Horton says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese are skills Horton sharpened under the tutelage of her first mentor, Alyse Myers, vice president of marketing at the New York Times. Myers pulled Horton into her office to compliment an idea she\u2019d presented in a meeting and to find out if she had more ideas to offer. To which Horton, who was 30 at the time, replied that she only had the one idea. Myers advised her to \u201cspeak up more often,\u201d Horton says with an easy laugh.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s two ways you can take that\u2014as a one-off or as something to run with,\u201d Horton said, and she ran right through that open door, developing ideas and asking her mentor questions in order to learn how to secure her footing on the rungs of the corporate ladder.\n\n\u201cSince then, I\u2019ve looked for that person in every job,\u201d Horton said. \u201cYou know, Tom Florio, former publisher of Vogue, who mentored me and recommended me for my job at Alexander Wang.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHorton, who gives as good as she gets when it comes to mentoring, is on the eve of her most personal and exciting project to date with Fashion Tech Connects.\n\nHorton\u2019s recipe for success? \u201cAn amazing team who you trust to deliver,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFashion Tech Connects\u2019 team players are co-founder Stacie Henderson, a former colleague of Horton\u2019s who is now CEO of Keep.com, along with corporate partners Farfetch, Stitch Fix and Alexander Wang. The collective mission is to guide college-age women to careers in either coding and development or in the business side of the luxury-goods industry.\n\n\u201cThese are all career paths that people don\u2019t know about,\u201d Horton says.\n\nHurdles of perception, such as \u201cthe stigma that the industry is impenetrable or that you have to be a fashion designer in order to find a job,\u201d are at the top of Horton\u2019s list of myths to be debunked. Internships are a critical part of the process for successful careers, and Fashion Tech Connects is there to provide qualified candidates with both education and, for those who rise to the top, entree into coveted fashion internships.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf we look at the current landscape of technology and fashion leadership, there is an obvious lack of women of color,\u201d says Horton, whose new executive role at Alexander Wang was reportedly the inspiration behind this season\u2019s fashion show, featuring models dressed as an army of high-powered female executives.\n\nIf Horton has her way, squads of black female power brokers are about to be on the next runway to reality 2.0.", "keywords": ["york", "alexander", "women", "executive", "fashion", "soars", "stephanie", "wang", "business", "vogue", "tech", "marketing", "doesnt", "horton"], "polarity": 0.19978698550127125, "subjectivity": 0.4454098811241669},

No, I do not.\u201d\n\nShe then compared neo-Nazis to gang members and felons.\n\n\u201cDo I know every member of a gang, whether they have a good heart or not? No, I don\u2019t. Do I know every man in prison, if he has a good heart or not? No,\u201d she added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBoth sides had a right,\u201d Dash repeated about the Charlottesville neo-Nazis and counterprotesters, \u201cbut there were both extremes.\u201d\n\nMaybe Dash is right.\n\nOn second thought, not wanting a literal parade of tiki-torch-wielding neo-Nazis in your town is a pretty wild stance. And how could you possibly know the heart of someone who says something like, \u201cFor us, it is conquer or die. This is a unique burden for the white man\u201d? (That was Richard Spencer, by the way.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow could you possibly know the inner life of someone who thinks a German dictator who committed mass genocide had a pretty good point? Who are we to judge a man who would rather ram his car into a crowd of people than accept being a minority in this country?\n\nCertainly not Ms. Dash.\n\nThis newfound compassion is quite an about-face for the woman vowing to be a \u201ccatalyst for change\u201d in California\u2019s 44th District. Dash has a long history of serving up her unwanted opinions on her blog and on Fox News, and had no reservations about judging others prior to this interview.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe\u2019s repeatedly spoken out against former President Barack Obama. In 2016, while attending the Conservative Political Action Conference, Dash said that Obama \u201cbamboozled us.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we all got blacked into it, \u201c she said, according to Essence.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t too concerned about knowing Jesse Williams\u2019 heart, either, when she called the actor a \u201cperfect example of a Hollywood plantation slave\u201d in a 2016 blog post after he spoke at the BET Awards.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe fact that you were standing on that stage at THOSE awards tells people you really don\u2019t know what your talking about. Just spewing hate and anger,\u201d Dash said, doling out harsher words to the Grey\u2019s Anatomy actor than she could muster giving to violent white supremacists.\n\nNor did Dash much care what was in the hearts of transgender activists fighting for their right to use the correct bathroom.\n\n\u201cOK, then go in the bushes,\u201d Dash said, also in 2016 (a real landmark year for knowing people\u2019s hearts, I suppose). \u201cI don\u2019t know what to tell you, but I\u2019m not gonna put my child\u2019s life at risk because you want to change a law,\u201d Dash added, bringing up a long-held but completely false belief that trans people pose a danger to children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd Dash couldn\u2019t find a word to mince when blogging about Black Lives Matter. Not only did she feel completely at home mocking one organizer, Aaron Goggans, for saying that black-on-black crime was a myth, but she also delivered a categorical condemnation of BLM\u2014despite not knowing their hearts: \u201cBlack Lives Matter is really a racist [movement] by definition\u2014providing a value based on the color of someones [sic] skin is Racist....

She also accused witnesses of lying at her husband's trial, calling \"the amount of perjury\" disturbing.\n\nBack in September, a jury found Matthew Apperson guilty of attempted second-degree murder for shooting into an occupied vehicle, as well as of aggravated assault with a firearm.\n\nZimmerman, who was acquitted for the 2012 killing of Trayvon Martin, claimed that Apperson shot at him unprovoked.

The Office for Civil Rights, under the Education Department, is supposed to \u201censure equal access to education and to promote educational excellence throughout the nation through vigorous enforcement of civil rights.\u201d\n\nTo achieve these goals, the Trump administration gave the position to a woman whose name is the only black-friendly thing about her.

These companies are tasked with placing borrowers in affordable repayment plans and preventing them from defaulting on their loans.\n\nAmid consumer complaints over poor communication, mismanaged paperwork and payment-processing delays, the Obama administration included some contract requirements intended to improve the quality of loan servicing, but companies complained that the requirements would be expensive and unnecessarily time-consuming.\n\nOn Tuesday, in a letter addressed to James W. Runcie, head of the Federal Student Aid office at the Education Department, DeVos said: \u201cThis process has been subjected to a myriad of moving deadlines, changing requirements and a lack of consistent objectives. We must promptly address not only these shortcomings but also any other issues that may impede our ability to ensure borrowers do not experience deficiencies in service. This must be done with precision, timeliness and transparency.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the Post, DeVos withdrew three memos issued by former Education Secretary John King and his undersecretary Ted Mitchell, including one that called for companies to be held accountable for providing borrowers with accurate, consistent and timely information about their debt.\n\nFrom the Washington Post concerning those Obama-era memos:\n\nThe 56-page memo [pdf] called for the creation of financial incentives for targeted outreach to people at great risk of defaulting on their loans, a baseline level of service for all borrowers and a contract flexible enough to penalize servicers for poor service, among other things. The Obama administration requested routine audits of records, systems, complaints and a compliance-review process. It also directed Runcie\u2019s team to base compensation on response time to answering calls, completing applications for income-driven repayment plans, errors made during communications and the amount of time it takes to process payments. Another memo insisted [pdf] FSA consider a company\u2019s past performance in divvying up the student loan portfolio.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlexis Goldstein, senior policy at Americans for Financial Reform, told the Post, \u201cIn order to have accountability, there must be real consequences when servicers violate the law. DeVos\u2019 actions today moves us away from true accountability, and creates dangers for the very student loan borrowers the department is responsible for protecting.\u201d\n\nThat particular list of demands came as a result of an outpouring of complaints to both the Education Department and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau about the practices of some loan servicers.\n\nMore from the Washington Post:\n\nThe CFPB, in particular, has documented instances of servicing companies providing inconsistent information, misplacing paperwork or charging unexpected fees. Because the federal government pays hundreds of millions of dollars to companies such as Navient, Great Lakes and American Education Services to manage $1.2 trillion in student loans, advocacy groups and lawmakers argue that more should be required of these contractors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs previously reported by The Root, the CFPB filed a federal lawsuit earlier this year alleging that Navient, the nation\u2019s largest servicer of student loans, has misled borrowers for years with respect to its policies and practices, costing them millions of dollars.\n\nThe company formerly known as Sallie Mae is the largest servicer of student loans in the United States. It services the loans of 12 million borrowers, including 6 million under a contract with the U.S. Department of Education, and handles more than $300 billion in federal and private student loans.\n\nAccording to the suit, Navient and its preferred collector, Pioneer Credit Recovery, engaged in \u201cunlawful acts and practices in connection with defendants\u2019 servicing and collection of student loans.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe suit alleges that Navient has failed at its core duties by deterring borrowers from obtaining access to long-term, affordable repayment plans and misleading them on how forbearance can be more costly to them in the end. It says that Navient buried a lot of useful information for borrowers in small print and, in other instances, hid information altogether that might have helped borrowers make better decisions about their repayment plans.\n\nMore from the Washington Post:\n\nNavient chief executive Jack Remondi, in an interview with the Washington Post earlier this year, said the government has too many inconsistencies in regulations and standards governing servicing companies. His company is battling multiple lawsuits that accuse Navient of steering people into costly payment options, rather than take the time to offer the best solutions\u2014charges that Remondi vehemently denies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDeVos said in her letter Tuesday that the new contract would provide an opportunity to improve borrower outcomes and demonstrate \u201csound fiscal stewardship\u201d of taxpayers dollars.\n\nOf course, all of this comes at a time when the Department of Education is facing $9 billion in proposed budget cuts. The Post reports that the Trump administration is redirecting money away from higher education programs and into its school choice agenda.\n\nRead more at the Washington Post.", "keywords": ["huge", "washington", "navient", "loan", "secretary", "education", "department", "removed", "protections", "loans", "post", "companies", "devos", "consumer", "student", "borrowers"], "polarity": 0.09891774891774892, "subjectivity": 0.4142992424242425},

Early Monday, Kushner released an 11-page statement claiming that he had no contact with Russian-government representatives beyond those that have already been publicly disclosed.\n\n\n\nAs CNN reports:\n\nKushner offers his first public accounting of what he says are his four meetings with Russians during the 2016 campaign and transition, offering previously undisclosed details of those meetings. The statement comes as federal and congressional investigators are scrutinizing Kushner\u2019s contacts with Russians as part of their probes into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.\n\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s troubling about the Trump administration\u2019s transparency ruse. After information has been discovered, or members of the administration are set to testify, there is what appears to be a public concession of truth. The Trumpians or Trumpites publicly release a statement of previously undisclosed documentation as if to say, \u201cSee, I\u2019ve got nothing to hide.\u201d\n\nWhen the New York Times was set to disclose that the president\u2019s oldest child, Donald Trump Jr., had met with a Russian lawyer under the pretense that he was going to receive damaging information about Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, Don Jr. took to Twitter to release emails detailing the meeting. It was supposed to be done under the guise of truth, except all of it happened to scoop the New York Times and give the appearance of transparency.\n\nSame is happening with Kushner\u2019s 11-page letter. But don\u2019t be fooled, because here is what we know about Kushner: Either he\u2019s one of the most incompetent people in this administration, which is saying a lot, or, like his father-in-law, he\u2019s a liar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn January, Kushner blamed an assistant for leaving a portion of his security-clearance form, the portion that just so happens to include meetings and/or dealings with foreign contacts, blank. According to Kushner, the draft of his form was submitted in error and a supplemental form was sent the day after the error was realized.\n\nRecently, Kushner submitted a revised financial disclosure form after he \u201cinadvertently omitted\u201d some $10 million in assets from his original disclosure. We should all be so lucky to forget about $10 million in assets.\n\nNevertheless, Kushner is set to testify Monday, and don\u2019t expect any groundbreaking news to come from this closed-door meeting. Expect Kushner to claim that there was no collusion between him and the Russians. You can also believe that Kushner will claim as just an oversight the reason his financial and security clearance forms weren\u2019t correct. Kushner is cut from the same cloth as his father-in-law, so expect him to feign ignorance and push the company\u2019s \u201cno collusion\u201d line.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is a developing story.

Simpson would be in prison forever. To hear white people tell it, O.J. is responsible for: ex-wife Nicole Simpson\u2019s and Ron Goldman\u2019s deaths; the current Black Lives Matter movement; Colin Kaepernick\u2019s protest and hair; Jay-Z and Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s maritial issues; and Drake\u2019s supposed baby with a former video vixen. (Sidenote: How does a video vixen retire? Does she turn in her performance thong and wedges? Just wondering.)\n\n\n\nSomehow, unbeknownst to any black person with a high school diploma or an equivalency degree, O.J. became the symbolic embodiment of black people, as far as white people were concerned. Maybe it was because he wanted so badly to be appreciated by them; maybe it was because during his trial on charges of killing Nicole Simpson and Goldman, black America embraced O.J. in a way that even took O.J. aback. Truthfully, what black America was embracing was an opportunity to challenge a racist, oppressive judicial system that continuously feeds on black and brown bodies, and O.J. just happened to be in the right place at the right time.\n\nBut on this Thursday, on this day of Our Lord and Savior Stephen Curry, let me let white folks in on a little secret: Black folks don\u2019t fuck with O.J. Truthfully, we never really did. In fact, we didn\u2019t care if O.J. served 200 years inside the sunken place, inside a boot that was placed squarely up his own ass. We don\u2019t ride for O.J. no more. That\u2019s so 2000.

In the backs of our minds, we all just figured that O.J. would stay in prison, contract some incurable disease and slowly die off the way that Hill Street Blues and Coolio have before him. In fact, we were taking bets on whether Orenthal J. Simpson was going to walk out a free man after serving almost nine years in prison for, get this, taking his own shit back!\n\nI know that the law calls this stealing, but what has always been troubling to me is how someone can steal O.J.\u2019s stuff, which the men who were robbed admitted to doing; then O.J. not only finds out that the stuff is stolen but goes to get it back, and the state awards him all the items, which he reportedly \u201cstole,\u201d but O.J. still gets 33 years in prison. That\u2019s ultimate white justice. Black folks knew that this was payback for the acquittal on the murder charges. And soon, O.J. will be free, which means he will go back to being O.J., and, sadly, he\u2019s black America\u2019s George Zimmerman, but more charming.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, during his parole hearing, which was televised, O.J. reached into his Naked Gun acting trick bag to pull out a few moves that would make young Denzel, before the big-teeth memes, jealous. O.J. was affable and funny and remorseful and convincing. He was dinner-party O.J. at his finest because O.J. can\u2019t stop O.J.-ing, which means I give him three days after his release before he\u2019s caught on a TMZ video saying some freakishly dumb shit. I give him a few weeks before he\u2019s on the golf course, and a few years before O.J. is back in jail because the one telling sign that O.J. hasn\u2019t changed one bit came when he was drilled on whether or not he attended Alcoholics Anonymous classes as instructed during his last parole hearing in 2013.\n\nO.J. waxed on about being a Christian and how he hadn\u2019t gone to AA but had found other classes that he thought were better, like conflict resolution.

And he might want to work a little harder in making it not look as if he\u2019s in the president\u2019s pocket.\n\nFor those not following any of this closely, here\u2019s what\u2019s been happening:\n\nNunes is the head of what is supposed to be an impartial committee tasked with finding out exactly what, if anything, is going on with President Vladimir TrumPutin, wiretapping and Russia.\n\n\n\nDuring the meeting, the heads of the FBI and the National Security Agency both publicly stated that former President Obama never wiretapped the dumb-ass president at any time.\n\n\n\nNow, here is where things get fuzzy: It\u2019s now being reported that Nunes met with some secret source on the White House grounds. According to CNN, Nunes was with a staff member Tuesday when he got a message and left the staff member and hopped in an Uber. Initially, Nunes\u2019 whereabouts were unknown, but now it\u2019s being reported that Nunes was on the White House grounds.\n\nWhatever documentation Nunes received, it didn\u2019t show that Trump had been wiretapped but, rather, as Vox reports, \u201cTrump officials had spoken to a foreign national whose communications were being monitored by U.S. intelligence, so their conversations were picked up despite the fact that they weren\u2019t targets of surveillance.\u201d\n\nNunes did not take this information to the FBI or the other members of the House Intelligence Committee, but took the information back to the White House to brief the president.\n\nNunes then held a press conference noting that \u201cthe intelligence community incidentally collected information about U.S. citizens involved in the Trump transition.\u201d Nunes even implied that the president\u2019s personal devices had been picked up, but he then moonwalked that comment back, saying that it was possible Trump had been recorded.\n\nTrump even boasted that he felt \u201csomewhat\u201d vindicated in hearing the news.\n\nSo let me spell it out for you: On Monday, Nunes was chairing a committee looking into wiretapping claims. On Tuesday he received information from an unnamed source on White House grounds. On Wednesday he told the president, and then went public implying, that the Obama administration tapped the president. He later backtracked that claim and then apologized for not sharing the news with the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll I know is this: It\u2019s starting to look as if the White House gave Nunes information that made it look like Trump had been tapped, and then Nunes went out there and made it look like Trump had been tapped. In short, Nunes is looking like a stooge for the White House.\n\nIf your head is spinning, don\u2019t worry, my head is spinning, too. If you\u2019re lost, just know this: Someone had to sign Nunes onto the White House grounds.

All four men have pleaded guilty to various charges.\n\nMueller has also charged Russian lawyer Alex van der Zwaan, who reportedly lied to federal investigators in the Russia probe in federal court on Feb. 16. He also pleaded guilty. Then there is Richard Pinedo, a California man who used stolen identities to sell bank accounts to Russians meddling in the election. Pinedo pleaded guilty, too. And let\u2019s not forget the 13 Russian nationals and three Russian companies that were indicted in February for allegedly interfering in the 2016 election. That\u2019s a ton of people to be charged, most of whom have already pleaded guilty, if there is no there there.\n\nBut why this tweet today, you ask? And why the obnoxious all caps?

In a closed-door interview, Hicks will be grilled as part of a separate investigation into alleged Russia interference in the 2016 election.

Trump doesn\u2019t like when people mess with \u201cHopester,\u201d as he affectionately calls her. Clearly, Trump is worried that all of the Russian walls are closing in around him. You can always tell, whenever someone goes all caps, that they\u2019ve been triggered, and clearly this happened to Trump this morning.

The entire indictment focused on how the charged parties used social media to organize pro-Donald Trump and anti-Hillary Clinton rallies and took on fake social media profiles, especially on Twitter and Facebook.\n\n\n\nMuch of this was designed to spark racial strife between white people and minority groups in an attempt to disrupt the 2016 presidential election and benefit Trump. The black guys on YouTube dissing Hillary Clinton and the notorious GOP Tennessee Twitter account, among many more of their kind, have been well-covered. Still, there is no evidence that any of these efforts swayed people to vote one way or the other.\n\nBuzzFeed asked experts if they believed that Russia\u2019s disinformation campaign was responsible for decreased black turnout in 2016, and none of them could say that was the case. Chryl Laird, a government professor at Bowdoin College in Maine, said that turnout was lower in 2016 than in 2012 because black voters simply weren\u2019t as excited about Clinton as they had been about Barack Obama. Instead, 2016 turnout should be compared with that of 2004, when it was more than 60 percent. \u201cObama would be considered a statistical outlier,\u201d Laird told BuzzFeed.\n\nI really don\u2019t see how Twitter bots discouraged black folks, least of all black women, from casting a ballot. Black voter turnout in presidential years has been on the uptick since the the mid-1990s. Of course, Obama was a once-in-a-lifetime president, and therefore, the black turnout would reflect that. In 2012, 66.6 percent of eligible black voters cast ballots, according to the Pew Research Center. That number dipped to 59.6 percent in 2016. That\u2019s just slightly below the 61.4 percent for overall voters that year.\n\nEvery available study finds that black men and women overwhelmingly voted for Hillary Clinton. Not sure Russian trolls had much impact. Now, voter suppression is another story. Then there is also this thing about older black folks having to risk their lives to vote and passing that tradition down to their children. If Jim Crow could not stop black folk from voting, I doubt that a Twitter troll would have more impact.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd I also doubt that Twitter bots made Trump supporters more racist. I am sure the Republicans who believed that Obama was a Muslim back in 2015 didn\u2019t need a bot to fuel their hate even more in 2016.\n\nThat said, I\u2019m suspicious of any article that argues Russian bots discouraged black voter turnout or encouraged white folks to be even more racist than they already are. Trump won because many white Americans wanted to maintain white supremacy.\n\nThank all of the Beckys\u2014aka the 53 percenters\u2014for that, not some unknown Twitter bot in Moscow.", "keywords": ["blaming", "stop", "turnout", "clinton", "voters", "2016", "white", "twitter", "russian", "racism", "bots", "trump", "peoples", "obama", "black"], "polarity": 0.05121882086167799, "subjectivity": 0.4058673469387756},

This is something that, at least in the case of Porter, could have prevented him from gaining full, permanent clearance.\n\nThe president is presumably allowing people to work with interim clearance, and as of now, we don\u2019t know which of those staffers have since gained full clearance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMike Rogers, a former Republican representative who chaired the House Intelligence Committee, told CNN last month: \u201cThe security clearance process is critical to keeping America\u2019s secrets. Foreign intelligence services look for vulnerabilities in individuals with access to our most sensitive information. Not following the process is a disservice not only to the individual but to our countries security interests. It\u2019s unusual that so many have taken so long.\u201d\n\nOf course, the White House is tight-lipped about both the security-clearance process and which members of the White House staff and administration do not have full clearance.\n\nStill, we have to question the implications for our national security when even the president himself would not have security clearance if it didn\u2019t automatically come with the job.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump also would not pass a full background check. There are things in his past that would render him ineligible for full security clearance. And yet, there he sits in the Oval Office\u2014with access to our military secrets and the power to launch us into nuclear war.\n\nAs we wait for special counsel Robert Mueller to figure out whether or not Trump obstructed justice and whether or not he was a pawn for the Russians, we need to be worried about who else the president has been running his mouth to. We\u2019ve seen from his frequent outbursts on Twitter that he lacks self-control and decorum.\n\nThe sloppiness with which this security-clearance issue has been handled is deplorable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to CNN, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was given access to top-secret information while working with interim status.\n\nAlso worth noting is the fact that former White House staffer Omarosa Manigault Newman was also working there without security clearance. She had no security clearance because she never applied for it.\n\nWe should be afraid.

Bannon was asked specific questions that had been negotiated between the White House and the House\u2019s lead counsel.\n\nBannon had been subpoenaed by the committee on Jan. 16 but managed to postpone the subpoena deadline three times as the White House and House lawyers negotiated which questions he could answer without the White House invoking executive privilege to prevent him from testifying.\n\nDemocrat Rep. Adam Schiff of California, ranking member of the committee, told reporters: \u201cThe only questions he would answer were questions that had been scripted, literally scripted for him by the White House.

Tyson was tried and convicted in 1992. He was released in 1995, his six-year sentence cut in half because of good behavior.\n\nTo this day, Tyson continues to say that he was innocent of the crime. Here\u2019s what Washington said after Tyson\u2019s conviction:\n\nAmong Tyson\u2019s supporters was his billionaire friend Donald Trump, who actually attempted a scheme that would have prevented Tyson from going to prison after his conviction.

Boxing promoter Don King was happy about Tyson\u2019s redemption and return to the ring: He had a big fight lined up.\n\nSupport for Tyson then by many factions of the black community must be put in historical context, one that is relevant as black America continues to debate about Nate Parker.\n\nDuring the 1990s, prominent black men in the public eye were seen by many black (male) opinion-makers and activists to be under attack.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n*The Rev. Benjamin Chavis, who, as executive director of the NAACP, had upset many whites when he attempted to unify the radical and moderate wings of the black movement, got ousted in 1994 for privately agreeing to use NAACP funds to settle a lawsuit filed by a female staffer in which he had had an affair. Chavis, like Tyson, also did a hasty conversion to Islam after his fall\u2014but Iron Mike chose orthodox Islam, while Chavis chose to join the Nation of Islam, a base from which he attempted redemption by organizing the Million Man March. Chavis left the Nation a few years after.\n\n*Mel Reynolds, a black Chicago congressman, had to resign his office in 1995 after his indictment for being sexually involved with a 16-year-old girl. Convicted of 12 counts of sexual assault, solicitation of child pornography and obstruction of justice, he was sentenced to five years in prison. Ironically, this opened the door for Jesse Jackson Jr., who went to jail in 2013 for wire and mail fraud, to win Reynolds\u2019 seat.\n\n*And then there was the Rev. Henry Lyons, who in 1999 was kicked out of his top post at the National Baptist Convention for embezzling $4 million spent on mistresses and luxury items. The news came out when his understandably upset wife set fire to a house Lyons co-owned with one of his side honeys. He was convicted of grand theft and racketeering and also served prison time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n*And do I have to mention O.J. Simpson and Michael Jackson?\n\nNone of these cases are similar. But in the 1990s, black people on the street, in the black-newspaper press, and on local and national black-oriented talk radio were clear on how blacks\u2014particularly their most prominent, influential men\u2014had been historically smeared, so they reacted accordingly.\n\nNate Parker\u2019s guilt or innocence aside, a friend of mine pointed out the following to me while I was writing this: Isn\u2019t it interesting that Parker\u2014who, unlike Tyson, was acquitted\u2014is being portrayed as the black-rapist-of-white-girl of the original Birth of a Nation film? Rightly or wrongly, I keep thinking of this should-we-support-Parker\u2019s-film controversy as, ironically, the 21st-century version of the late-1960s furor over white novelist William Styron\u2019s fictionalized maligning of Nat Turner. Again a great anti-slavery hero is being tarnished in the public domain, obscuring Turner\u2019s braveheart contribution via white supremacy\u2019s fog.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSadly, Parker was supposed to fix all of this, not get caught up.\n\nBut history should never be used to excuse abuse by black men. Admittedly, this idea is\u2014and perhaps should be\u2014a hard sell in a country created by still-celebrated white male robbers and rapists.\n\nBlack youths, particularly black males, are constantly warned to avoid the traps set for them by white America and the police, its state agents. So at the risk of \u201cmansplaining,\u201d it\u2019s clearly past time to add male entitlement, including and especially sexual entitlement, to the Talk.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is new is that black women are no longer on the sidelines of these discussions, and black male abuses\u2014even ones seen to be historically exploited by whites trying to damage the black public sphere\u2014are no longer tolerated in 2016. *Cough*\u2014Bill Cosby\u2014*cough.* Sisters are tired of taking one for the red-black-and-green team when they have to constantly leave the field bloodied, sexually abused and humiliated. Now they speak out\u2014openly, directly and powerfully\u2014online and on campus. The web, not even fully developed when Desiree Washington was attacked by Tyson, continues to hold black Twitter\u2019s internationally seen explosions over Parker.\n\nMike Tyson\u2019s advantage is that no one ever expected anything significant from him, then or now. Parker is clearly a different story. With the incredible pressure the filmmaker is now under, he will have to do more, much more, than just issue a statement of semiapology\u2014well surpassing the minuscule and unsatisfying efforts of Chavis, Lyons, Reynolds and others of the dial-up-modem era.\n\nParker might have to enter into the public-arena ring, gloves on\u2014fighting not for himself or his historically explosive art, but for the history and current state of black people, for future young black men and black women who will one day soon, fairly or not, judge him and his work by what happens next.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTodd Steven Burroughs, an independent researcher and writer based in Newark, N.J., is the author of Son-Shine on Cracked Sidewalks, an audiobook on Amiri Baraka and Ras Baraka through the eyes of the 2014 Newark mayoral campaign.

Simpson appears on the television screen, I wind up remembering that he is still alive. That after all he has gone through, O.J. is not yet at the point where white people are spitting and urinating on his grave.\n\nThe latest time this happened was just Friday, the day of Muhammad Ali\u2019s public memorial, when PBS\u2019 Charlie Rose show had a segment on the 10-hour, five-part documentary series O.J.: Made in America, which debuts tonight on ABC and continues next week on ESPN. It\u2019s the latest product of ESPN\u2019s popular 30 for 30 documentary series.\n\nThe early reviews are very positive, with thumbs-up blurbs galore: \u201cthe ultimate intersection of race, class and the city of Los Angeles\u201d; \u201cplenty of American reinvention and denial\u201d; \u201chow the criminal justice system and the court of public opinion actually work.\u201d\n\nMy memories of this period are pretty stark. Cable television had exploded from a 60-channel universe to a 100-channel one. CNN had new 24-hour competition in MSNBC, and more coming. Overseas television news bureaus were being cut, and television newsmagazines\u2014not sober, international investigative ones like CBS\u2019 60 Minutes, but ones dealing with sensational domestic issues, especially murder and mayhem\u2014began to proliferate.\n\nTV\u2019s new use of extensive, wall-to-wall coverage, heretofore used only during assassinations and attempted assassinations of U.S. presidents, was perfected during the 1991 Gulf War. That moneymaking momentum had to continue. So extensive and sensational coverage of lurid public events\u2014the Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill sexual harassment hearings of 1991; the publicly exposed sexual exploits of 1992 presidential candidate Bill Clinton; the case of figure skaters Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan in 1994 and child-molestation charges against Michael Jackson the previous year\u2014had allowed cost-conscious television news to create a tabloid television culture.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then in June of 1994 came former football star, TV pitchman and movie actor O.J. Simpson. Accused of murdering his white, blond ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman, Simpson was broadcast live on TV being chased by police in a white Bronco. The next 16 months of television were swallowed by what local and national television outlets were calling \u201cThe Trial of the Century.\u201d (My nickname for it back then was \u201cOthello.\u201d) Cable and local weekday non-network-affiliate TV programming was practically suspended during the weekday as the live feed kept the nation informed of every (mostly) boring minute.\n\nAmerica learned about O.J.\u2019s high-powered legal team, especially Robert Kardashian (the now-dead patriarch of the reality-TV clan) and a very well-dressed, very articulate black man named Johnnie Cochran.\n\nThe October 1995 verdict, O.J.\u2019s acquittal, created what was then called a \u201cwhite riot\u201d\u2014angry whites writing newspaper and magazine articles, late-night TV hosts joking about Simpson being a murderer for the next year, and Rush Limbaugh and other right-wing radio hosts exploding in popularity. (Much of black America saw a black lawyer achieving a victory over a white racist judicial system and a white racist Los Angeles Police Department.) This \u201cwhite riot\u201d over Simpson\u2014a politically and socially \u201ccolorless\u201d black man and the ultimate assimilator\u2014ironically fed the fire for black men to assemble for the first Million Man March.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have tried very hard to forget this time. The period between the end of the Cold War and 9/11 had a ridiculous level of promise. It was largely squandered. The smoke from the 1992 Los Angeles disturbances still in the air, the culture became shallow while Clinton fought to get in and remain in office. Politically conscious rap got its lunch eaten by The Chronic, a herald for a coming decade of gangsta hip-hop music. It was the kind of period where recently freed Nelson Mandela was photographed with the Spice Girls. Wall Street was booming, and consumption and increased entertainment were in vogue.\n\nOne historian even said that it was the end of history, while an increasingly popular black scholar said that black America had developed a nihilistic streak. America\u2019s optimists were convinced that the entire planet was going to drive on the \u201cInformation superhighway\u201d (as it was then called), and a new realm of world social equality was, somehow, going to be born from that experience.\n\nO.J. stands at the center of the 1990s, essentially a frat-party decade for America\u2019s rulers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPost-9/11 society has been less forgiving. Simpson, in jail since 2008 for robbery and kidnapping, has changed American 21st-century culture in fundamental ways. Forever parodied as \u201cJackie Chiles\u201d on never-ending Seinfeld reruns (the sitcom \u201cabout nothing\u201d being the quintessential 1990s product!), Cochran became a household name in black communities thanks to the O.J. trial, and the trusted brand of an injury law firm that was a fixture among weekday local TV commercials. Orange juice permanently lost its nickname. Murder trials covered live on cable television no longer have a special appeal. And professional black athletes are \u201cfree\u201d to be as misogynist and domestically violent as their sports leagues, the courts and the American public will allow.\n\nPost-O.J. culture is one without the illusion of innocence, and Simpson has gone from colorless to invisible. Like the recent FX docudrama miniseries The People v. O.J. Simpson, this forthcoming documentary series attempts to find him, huddled, in the white shadows.\n\nTodd Steven Burroughs, an independent researcher and writer based in Newark, N.J., is the author of Son-Shine on Cracked Sidewalks, an audiobook on Amiri Baraka and Ras Baraka through the eyes of the 2014 Newark mayoral campaign.

Bush and a current professor at Georgetown University Law Center, was nominated by President Donald Trump this week to sit on a federal commission that sets policy on how to punish criminals.\n\nIt would come as no surprise that Otis is a staunch supporter of Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 hard-line approach of imposing mandatory minimum sentences and resurrecting the war on drugs. But Otis, thanks to his popular legal blog, Crime and Consequences, has also made his racist beliefs both explicit and easily searchable.\n\nAs the Washington Post reports, Otis once defended a federal judge who was called out for saying that black and Latinx people were more violent than white people.\n\nIn a 2013 post he titled, \u201cThe PC Attempt to Intimidate Judges,\u201d Otis wrote:\n\nWhen Fifth Circuit Judge Edith Jones said at a University of Pennsylvania Law School talk that blacks and Hispanics are more violent than whites, a consortium of civil rights organizations filed a complaint. ... The complaint calls for stern discipline on the grounds that the remarks were \u201cdiscriminatory and biased.\u201d So far as I have been able to discover, it makes no mention of the fact that they\u2019re true.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the Post noted, Otis dug himself further into the racist-commentary trenches in the comments section, where Otis saw fit to compare black people to Asians, whom he called \u201cOrientals.\u201d\n\n\u201cOrientals,\u201d Otis claimed, have a lower incidence of crime than other groups because they have the right values. Here is that passage in full:\n\nThis is the reason that, for example, Orientals have less incidence of crime than whites. Orientals were unquestionably the victims of long and rancid racial bigotry; coolie labor was little more than slave labor. And Yick Wo v. Hopkins is one of the most famous civil rights cases of all time. The reason Orientals stay out of jail more than either whites or blacks is that family life, work, education and tradition are honored more in Oriental culture than in others.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis, of course, is flatly ahistorical. While Asian groups have certainly been discriminated against, that treatment simply cannot be compared to the history of anti-black racism in the U.S. \u201cCoolie labor,\u201d as Otis puts it (the term is dated and derogatory, and refers to Asian laborers) is not comparable to over 200 years of chattel slavery.\n\nIn the same post, Otis also flatly denied that white people\u2019s racial bigotry caused black people to \u201cmake ... more criminal choices.\u201d\n\nAs if trying to hit all the twisted, racist lines of \u201clogic\u201d that he could, Otis next brought up Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas as his example of a good black person with the \u201cright values\u201d:\n\nValues, not race or skin color, influence choices. Some of the bravest men in public life \u2014 Justice Clarence Thomas comes to mind \u2014 had the \u201cwrong\u201d skin color but the right values (see Thomas\u2019s autobiography, \u201cMy Grandfather\u2019s Son\u201d). They made honorable and courageous choices, and succeeded. This is one of the reasons the grievance-monger crowd \u2014 the people who now want to hammer Judge Jones \u2014 have a special hate for Justice Thomas.\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat Thomas\u2019 values apparently include perjury and harassment of women apparently evaded the Georgetown law professor.\n\nThe Post also found another blog from 2014 in which Otis referred to an offender sarcastically as \u201cMr. Nicey.\u201d The post was written in response to a bill called the \u201cSmarter Sentencing Act\u201d that would have reduced sentences for some drug and low-level offenders.\n\nHere\u2019s what he wrote:\n\nLast I looked, when you needle yourself with too much heroin, you\u2019re still dead; when a thug belts you to grab your purse, you still have a knot on your head and no purse; and when Mr. Nicey rapes your eight year-old, you still have a defiled little girl to try to help.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis bears repeating: Trump\u2019s pick for the U.S. Sentencing Commission, which determines what criminal sentences to dole out, has written that black and Latinx people commit more crimes because of their collective substandard values, and appears to think that selling an eighth of an ounce of weed (a low-level offense) is akin to child rape.\n\nThe comments that Otis has made on his blog aren\u2019t racist dog whistles. They\u2019re the air horn of racism. They\u2019re also terrifyingly recent\u2014all made within the last five years.\n\nOtis\u2019 nomination was announced on Thursday and is one of four that Trump made. His appointment could still be rejected by the Senate.", "keywords": ["right", "theyre", "sentences", "comments", "taps", "internet", "whites", "racist", "trump", "walking", "post", "federal", "otis", "values", "thomas", "blogger", "black", "job"], "polarity": 0.03983653162757637, "subjectivity": 0.43761549395877763},

It couldn\u2019t possibly be because the president of the United States and the overlord of Russia are secretly play cousins who spend the night over each other\u2019s house and make forts out of bedsheets in the basement of the White House and read books with flashlights, could it?\n\n\n\nEver since news broke of a possible scandal involving Russia and the subsequent investigation, there have been rumors that Trump wanted Sessions to stay involved. Because Sessions straight up lied during his Senate confirmation hearing, claiming that he\u2019d never met with Russian officials, he recused himself from all Russia-related matters.\n\nNow, according to several reports, Trump was not only pissed that Sessions recused himself from the Justice Department\u2019s investigation into potential ties between Russia and the Trump campaign, but he reportedly ordered his top lawyer to try to stop Sessions from doing so.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, White House counsel Don McGahn, acting on orders from the president, tried but failed to persuade Sessions not to recuse himself.\n\nNBC News reports that McGahn and several White House officials called Sessions to insist that he not recuse himself, but Sessions had already made up his mind after reports surfaced that Sessions had conveniently forgotten to disclose contacts he\u2019d had with Russia\u2019s ambassador to the United States.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter recusing himself in March, Sessions would suddenly remember several interactions he had with Russians during Senate committee hearings in June and October.\n\nA White House lawyer for Trump, Ty Cobb, told NBC News that he had no comment on the Times report.\n\n\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that the Trump administration has been vocal about Sessions\u2019 recusal. In fact, during a July press conference, Trump blatantly stated that he didn\u2019t believe that Sessions should have taken himself out of the investigation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe should not have recused himself from the Russia investigation almost immediately after he took office, and if he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me prior to taking office, and I would have quite simply picked somebody else,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair to the presidency.\u201d\n\n\n\nOne thing has been consistent since Trump took office, and that\u2019s the fact that skullduggery, lying and Russia\u2019s raiding of the White House fridge at ungodly hours is the new state of the nation.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter what comes out of this administration; at this point, this is how I feel about every claim lobbed at the president:\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at the New York Times and NBC News.", "keywords": ["russia", "times", "recused", "investigation", "house", "white", "trump", "probe", "persuade", "recuse", "lawyer", "reports", "jeff", "report", "urged", "sessions"], "polarity": 0.020730027548209365, "subjectivity": 0.3796700773973502},

The Brooklyn, N.Y., MC from Bed-Stuy is one of the all-time greats, and despite his small catalog\u2014two proper studio releases, Ready to Die (1994) and Life After Death (1997)\u2014he is highly revered in the hip-hop community. And he is STILL the MC I\u2019m most impressed by.\n\n\n\nJay-Z is my favorite rapper of all time. Some of that is due to my undying loyalty to his debut album, Reasonable Doubt. The rest is due to how many songs and albums of his I enjoy, how good a rapper he was at his height (and how long that height was) and how much better he is at rapping than so many others, even now. Greats gon\u2019 great.\n\nBut even as great as Jay is, Biggie will always be the one who makes me laugh and shake my head at his sheer ability and witty wordplay. Even on Reasonable Doubt, Biggie and Jay traded bars on \u201cBrooklyn\u2019s Finest\u201d in a real Ali-vs.-Frazier-style rap-off, and Biggie\u2019s lines STILL stand above them all:\n\nMe and Gutta had two spots, the two-for-five dollar hits, the blue tops, gotta go Coolio, mean it\u2019s getting too hot, if Fay [Faith] had twins she\u2019d probably have two Pacs, get it, Tupac\u2019s ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat STILL gives me the warm-and-fuzzies. And this is on a track where Jay said, \u201cLike short sleeves, I bear arms ... \u201d Those guys.\n\nListening to the back-to-back bangers \u201cUnbelievable\u201d and \u201cSuicidal Thoughts\u201d (among the rest of the records on the album), I can\u2019t help being impressed by how lyrically dextrous he was on \u201cUnbelievable,\u201d where he famously weaved \u201crecent shenanigans\u201d into the first verse.\n\n\u201cSuicidal Thoughts\u201d was a clinic in storytelling, dark as it was. \u201cJuicy,\u201d which is still one of my favorites of his, is inspirational, a real hood success story. Ready to Die was a classic the moment it was released for showing us the promise Biggie exhibited on \u201cParty and Bullshit.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd he only leveled up on Life After Death. There is one song where every single time I listen to it, I get sad for what could have been\u2014at the same time, I also feel fortunate for having grown up in a time where I got to experience a rapper who was so good at what he did\u2014and that\u2019s \u201cKick in the Door\u201d (a song with a beat that Puffy famously didn\u2019t like). \u201cKick in the Door\u201d is Biggie\u2019s lyrical beatdown to \u201cthose that choose to use disrespectful views on the king of NY.\u201d\n\nThat song should be studied in classes about creative writing for how perfect the wordplay is. And \u201cI Got a Story to Tell\u201d? Bruh. Easily one of the top five greatest stories on hip-hop wax ever. And truthfully, I could go song for song on both of his albums and talk about how his lyrics and craft are unparalleled, but to know Biggie is to already know his talent. Even Born Again, his posthumous release, featured \u201cDead Wrong,\u201d which, good gracious. One day, I promise you, I listened to it 20 times in a row.\n\nI won\u2019t say that there aren\u2019t other MCs who are as capable as Biggie. We\u2019ve had a few; Jay-Z comes to mind, and who can forget other cats like Andr\u00e9 3000 and even Prodigy from Mobb Deep, who I don\u2019t think gets nearly the credit he deserves? But if you take the best assets of the best rappers to ever do it, Biggie had at least an above-average mastery of each of them. He had personality, wit, lyrics, flow, swag, humor, edge and every other characteristic you could want in a rapper.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEvery year on March 9, we celebrate him; it\u2019s been 21 years since he passed away. And every year, when I listen to my Biggie albums, I still find myself smiling and appreciating his gifts and what he did give us while he was here. He impressed me with his skills, something that only a few rappers have ever done. Any rapper would be smart to attempt to emulate him. He had it all.\n\nWe\u2019ll always love Big Poppa.", "keywords": ["21", "notorious", "mc", "biggie", "albums", "rapper", "aka", "song", "impresses", "wordplay", "big", "later", "good", "jay", "impressed", "life"], "polarity": 0.23452737077737076, "subjectivity": 0.5515837403337402},

Well, that is where people who have guns (read: tabacky-chewing, Hulk Hogan-loving Americans) sell guns to other Americans (read: mesh-hat-wearing, NASCAR-loving white men) with little to no requirements other than that said Budweiser-drinking American has the correct amount to purchase said firearm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe have to stop this nonsense,\u201d the president said.

Someone needs to start choking to end this meeting!\u201d A few members coughed, but no one actually faked a full choking scene.\n\n\u201cTake the guns first, go through due process second,\u201d Trump suggested.\n\n\n\nThe president then straight-up slammed Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), who is pushing a bill to broaden background checks. Trump asked Toomey if his plan included raising the minimum age to purchase a firearm from 18 to 21. Toomey told the president it did not. To which the president replied: \u201cYou know why , bitch ? Because you\u2019re afraid of the NRA.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDemocrats might be spineless, but they aren\u2019t stupid.

It was a balmy 69 degrees where I live, but there must be a reason I didn\u2019t get an invite. Probably the Mueller investigation.\n\nAnyway, Us Weekly reports that Hov and Queen Bey turned the garage at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles into an old-school Hollywood glamour lounge for around 150 guests who were sworn to secrecy, which upsets me even more, because I\u2019ve always wanted to go to the Chateau Marmont.\n\nHonestly, I have no clue what the Chateau Marmont is, but had my invitation not been stolen by kids in the neighborhood, I could have found out.

When asked on the red carpet if she was doing anything to celebrate her Oscar nomination, the R&B diva told Entertainment Tonight: \u201cThe fam is doing something big for us tonight.

General Michael T. Flynn (Ret.) After over 33 years of military service to our country, including nearly five years in combat away from my family, and then my decision to continue to serve the United States, it has been extraordinarily painful to endure these many months of false accusations of \u201ctreason\u201d and other outrageous acts. Such false accusations are contrary to everything I have ever done and stood for. But I recognize that the actions I acknowledged in court today were wrong, and through my faith in God, I am working to set things right. My guilty plea and agreement to cooperate with the Special Counsel\u2019s Office reflect a decision I made in the best interest of my family and of our country. I accept full responsibility for my actions.\n\nYes, he did invoke his military service and his faith in God.\n\nClearly, former FBI Director James Comey was not going to let that slide, because he sent out the most epic subtweet, complete with biblical-Scripture quote:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd the accompanying Instagram post shows us just how deep Comey\u2019s petty runs:\n\nAs has been said many times this morning already, this finna be good.\n\nEarlier:\n\nMichael Flynn, the former national security adviser to Donald Trump, pleaded guilty Friday to charges of lying to the FBI about conversations he had with the Russian ambassador last December during the presidential transition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe New York Times reports that Flynn made an appearance in a federal court in Washington, D.C., as part of a plea deal that inches special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election just a bit closer to Donald Trump\u2019s inner circle.\n\nFlynn lasted only 24 days as national security adviser before being forced to resign after it was revealed that he had lied to Vice President Mike Pence about his conversations with Russian officials during the presidential transition.\n\nSo did he really lie to Pence, or was Pence also complicit? Is Jared Kushner now dangling in the wind? Could Flynn be preparing to testify against the president himself?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe charges Flynn pleaded guilty to Friday morning amount to a veritable slap on the wrist in comparison with all the evidence stacked against him, and they are nothing compared with the charges faced by another Trump associate, Paul Manafort.\n\nManafort was charged with conspiracy against the United States, to which he pleaded not guilty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo the question is, with Flynn pleading guilty to this light-as-a-feather charge, what is he getting\u2014and giving\u2014in exchange?\n\nThere is no way Mueller is granting plea deals for small fish. Flynn has to be dropping the goods on someone big\u2014maybe more than one someone.\n\nThis is also a clear indication that Mueller\u2019s team was able to flip Flynn, but not Manafort. Manafort took his lumps, pleaded not guilty to the charges and now waits to see what happens next.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFlynn, on the other hand, was apparently as nervous as a sow at a North Carolina pig-pulling when it became clear that the investigators would stop at nothing to get to the dirt, even if it meant taking his son Michael G. Flynn down with him.\n\nHe was ready to sing, but which song did he pick?\n\nMy money is on the Kushner-Pence-Trump trifecta. For as smug as Pence is, you know he had to know a lot.

His tough stance against the Soviet Union\u2019s expansionism and his efforts to support anti-Soviet movements in former communist-bloc states helped lead to the USSR\u2019s fall in 1991. His \u201cTear down this wall\u201d speech at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin on June 12, 1987, is remembered for its symbolism and defiance as well as Reagan\u2019s robust behind-the-scenes diplomacy. (Of course, Reagan\u2019s other policies in general were horrible, but that is another story.)\n\nRepublicans today herald Reagan as the guardian who stood up against Soviet aggression and a symbol of the Republican Party\u2019s hawkish foreign policy against Moscow. But it is obvious that the reputation Reagan cultivated for his party is under threat by Donald Trump, a Republican president who many believe is in cahoots with the Kremlin. Not only is there a special investigation into whether Trump\u2019s campaign colluded with Russia to win the 2016 presidential election, but Trump\u2019s attempts to cozy up to Vladimir Putin are doing little to ease those concerns.\n\nBefore and during his campaign for president, Trump lamented that former President Barack Obama was weak on Russia\u2019s aggression in Ukraine and Syria. During a videoconference call to a high-profile annual conference in Kiev, Ukraine, in September of 2015, Trump said, \u201cOur president is not strong\u2014so far all we have is lip service,\u201d adding, \u201cPart of the problem that Ukraine has with the United States is that Putin does not respect our president whatsoever.\u201d In 2016, Trump tweeted about Obama\u2019s lack of strength against Russia over Ukraine.\n\nInterestingly, though, Trump has essentially failed to stand up to Russia\u2019s meddling in European elections or, for that matter, our own elections. Trump\u2019s lack of enthusiasm for blasting the Kremlin is obvious\u2014I mean, Putin helped him win the White House\u2014but that should not stop Republicans from attacking Trump with the same zeal as they did Obama\u2014if, of course, they really are Russia hawks.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), one of Obama\u2019s sharpest critics, wrote in the National Review that Obama needed to reverse his \u201cpolicy of weakness\u201d against Russia over Syria. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said in April 2014 that Obama\u2019s refusal to grant Ukraine critical defensive weapons was \u201canother sign of weakness\u201d in Putin\u2019s eyes. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told CNN that Obama was \u201cweak and indecisive.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFast-forward several years later, and we have Trump, who has yet to grant Ukraine defensive weapons, failing to punish Russia for arguably the greatest attack against U.S. democracy in American history or criticize Putin for what many human rights organizations say is Russia\u2019s bombing of civilian targets in Syria.\n\nThe lack of criticism from the Republican Party for Trump\u2019s handling of Russian aggression is just as apparent. There was plenty of room to criticize Obama for his response to Putin\u2019s geopolitical chess match in Europe and elsewhere, but Trump? Not so much.\n\nSure, he is the GOP\u2019s president, but does party loyalty rank higher than allowing Trump to stand down against Putin\u2019s geopolitical aggression, which has only intensified over the past year? That appears to be the case. Has McCain, Rubio or Graham called Trump weak even once? I Googled and actually found Russian officials calling Trump \u201cweak.\u201d Ironic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nObama\u2019s stance against Russia may have been slow, and his understanding of Moscow\u2019s motives may have left much to be desired, but in light of the Trump campaign\u2019s possible collusion with the Kremlin, Obama, comparatively speaking, looks like the real hawk.\n\nObama\u2019s economic sanctions helped force Russia\u2019s economy to contract by 3.7 percent in 2015. In addition, key drilling projects were forced to shut down as a result. Naturally, Ukraine and U.S. Russia hawks wanted more, but the devastating impact of the Obama administration\u2019s action was hardly weak.\n\nOn the other hand, the Republican response to the Russian collusion scandal has been very weak. When then-acting U.S. Attorney General Sally Yates and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper testified in May that ex-national security adviser Mike Flynn may have been compromised by Russia, GOP senators were more concerned about who leaked the story to the media than gathering information about Flynn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRepublicans also pushed back against former FBI Director James Comey during his June testimony when he said Trump fired him because of his handling of the Russia investigation.

Bet.\u201d And Beyonc\u00e9 was in the other room like \u201cTEXAS.\u201d And then they came up with this idea to do the song together, and Future is happy again.\n\nBut that\u2019s not why we\u2019re here!

And then, I only learned because I was tip-shamed by a woman I was dating.\n\nShe saw I didn\u2019t leave a tip on the Long Island iced teas I\u2019d ordered for both of us (again, I was 25) and asked, \u201cReally? No tip?\u201d\n\nI replied, \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\nShe then raised her eyebrows, tilted her head and squinted at me with an expression that could best be described as the \u201cI can\u2019t believe I thought you were spongeworthy\u201d face and began gulping her untipped drink. I don\u2019t miss my 20s.\n\nIn my defense, at that point in my life, I had perfectly justifiable reasons for not knowing that tipping was expected. My parents weren\u2019t drinkers, so appropriate and responsible alcohol-consumption behaviors never came up. When I started going to clubs and bars in college, I was still so broke that my only form of alcohol consumption was pregaming.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI didn\u2019t get an actual drink at the bar until I was in my early 20s, but then I was (still) so broke that I\u2019d get to the club early as shit to catch those \u201cFree drinks before 10:47 p.m. or if you\u2019re wearing a lavender thong\u201d specials. If I did happen to have some extra money and I happened to be out, I was (probably) also eating with my drink, so whichever tip I left was factored into the total bill. I existed in a bubble of not tipping for alcohol and would\u2019ve continued to had I not been shamed.\n\nThat in mind, I understand why some adults are so adamantly against tipping. If you weren\u2019t introduced to it as a young person, I can see how the idea of giving a restaurant extra money on top of your bill and having to solve an equation in order to do it can seem wack, like, \u201cI\u2019m giving you more cash AND I have to do algebra? Fuck this.\u201d I imagine it sounds the way tithing sounds to a non-Christian. \u201cI gotta give you money so I can see Jesus? I thought Jesus was free. Bethlehem ain\u2019t have no membership fees.\u201d\n\nTo be clear, understanding isn\u2019t excusing. If you\u2019re an adult, you should do the things expected of adulthood. Tipping, regardless of how you feel about it, is one of those things. You don\u2019t get to opt out just because you believe it\u2019s wack. It doesn\u2019t make you principled\u2014just a wack motherfucker with arbitrarily shitty principles. But I understand the reluctance that (some) people possess, especially if it\u2019s a relatively new concept.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat I don\u2019t understand is that, within this tipping conversation and tipping economy, fast-food workers are always left out. And this dynamic exists despite the fact that they probably work harder than everyone.\n\nIf you\u2019re working for McDonald\u2019s or Burger King, you\u2019re on your feet for eight hours, you\u2019re dealing with literally all types of people (babies, assholes, teenagers, drunks, Kappas, etc.), you\u2019re dealing with people who expect their food to be ready in 15 seconds and you\u2019re doing everything. You\u2019re not just on the fries. You\u2019re on the fries and flipping burgers and emptying trash and cleaning bathrooms and subduing Samuel L. Jackson and his shotgun. And you\u2019re doing all of this for a tipless minimum wage.\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course, you could say that some people who eat at fast-food restaurants are eating there specifically because they don\u2019t have enough disposable money for things like tipping. And that\u2019s fine. But what about the people who do\u2014who\u2019d leave a $7 tip on a $30 bill at the Cheesecake Factory but wouldn\u2019t think to tell the cashier at Taco Bell to just keep the change when handing him $10 for a $7.21 bill?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt gets even more absurd when you consider that maybe, if that fast-food restaurant has a register-adjacent jar for a charity\u2014the Ronald McDonald House or the United Way, perhaps\u2014people might put change in there. But why is that better than the cashier\u2019s pocket, or the fry cook\u2019s pocket, or the shift manager\u2019s pocket, or anyone\u2019s pocket behind the counter?\n\nAn obvious counter is that while fast-food workers make minimum wage, servers at restaurants make even less, so tipping is more vital there. But I just don\u2019t think that a food worker\u2019s income (or lack thereof) is our primary social and psychological motivation for tipping. It\u2019s less \u201cI need to supplement this person\u2019s income\u201d and more \u201cThis person provided me some yummy food and decent service, and I want to thank them.\u201d\n\nOften, when I write a piece asking questions like this, they\u2019re rhetorical. I already know the answers, and I\u2019m either trying to find the rationale or trying to articulate how absurd those rationales are. I have no answers for this, though.

The song samples her famous 1966 song \u201cFour Women,\u201d released on the Wild Is the Wind album. For those who were introduced to her through Jay-Z, I\u2019m both happy and sad: happy because at least they were introduced, and sad because that\u2019s a lot of good Nina Simone music they\u2019ve been missing out on.\n\n\u201cFour Women\u201d is one of the most powerful songs I\u2019ve ever heard in my entire life. From the piano riff that runs through the entire song, which is nothing short of heaven-sent in its perfection, to the buildup at the end to punctuate the emotions and the stories of the four women who are the essence of the song, \u201cFour Women\u201d brilliantly shares the various pain and struggles of black womanhood in America, as faced by these four black figures: Aunt Sarah, Saffronia, Sweet Thing and Peaches.\n\nAccording to an old Village Voice piece written by Thulani Davis after Simone passed away in 2003:\n\n\n\nBut it was \u201cFour Women,\u201d an instantly accessible analysis of the damning legacy of slavery, that made iconographic the real women we knew and would become. For African American women it became an anthem affirming our existence, our sanity, and our struggle to survive a culture which regards us as anti-feminine. It acknowledged the loss of childhoods among African American women, our invisibility, exploitation, defiance, and even subtly reminded that in slavery and patriarchy, your name is what they call you.\n\nAs a youth, I\u2019d heard Simone\u2019s music through my own discovery of new artists, but it (admittedly) wasn\u2019t until Kanye West sampled \u201cSinnerman\u201d for Talib Kweli\u2019s \u201cGet By\u201d in 2002 that I did a deep dive into her entire catalog. I spent a week digging into internet crates looking for every album I could find, trying to learn as much as I could.\n\nHer political messaging stood out to me particularly because of the timing and tone of a lot of her music\u2014so much was released in the heat of the civil rights movement\u2014and she didn\u2019t make any bones about her feelings over what was happening in America.\n\nFrom the Washington Post about the creation of the song \u201cMississippi Goddam\u201d:\n\nWhen Nina Simone heard about the bombing death of four young girls at the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Ala., in 1963, she famously went to her garage and tried to build a zip gun to take out her anger on someone. When her husband suggested that her music would be a more effective weapon, she wrote \u201cMississippi Goddam,\u201d a politically charged song that declared, \u201cLord have mercy on this land of mine / we all gonna get it in due time.\u201d When she released the song in 1964, it contained this curious, spoken aside: \u201cThis is a show tune, but the show hasn\u2019t been written for it yet.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFour Women\u201d follows along in that political ideology, and from the moment I first heard it, I was drawn into it. It\u2019s almost impossible not to feel something. She electrified us with her storytelling, and influenced other artists\u2014there are plays and works named in honor of the song\u2014by creating offerings that spoke to black womanhood in ways that resonated broadly, but particularly among black women.\n\nHer catalog contains so many gems that one listen through any greatest-hits compilation would whet your appetite for more. From \u201cPlease Don\u2019t Let Me Be Misunderstood\u201d to the aforementioned \u201cSinnerman\u201d and \u201cMississippi Goddam\u201d to \u201cI Put a Spell on You,\u201d you can find almost anything you\u2019re looking for from Nina Simone. She has over 30 albums for your choosing, but even among the many gems, \u201cFour Women\u201d stands out for its impact and purpose.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s why they call her Peaches, the last of the four women:", "keywords": ["history", "women", "introduced", "perfect", "moments", "nina", "mississippi", "song", "music", "released", "simones", "black", "simone", "heard"], "polarity": 0.11215200029855203, "subjectivity": 0.4679047245857591},

You know I rock with you. You\u2019re my man 100 grand. But why are you devoting an entire explainer to the difference between two words I can just go and find in the dictionary?\n\nThank you for the kind words! I should tell you, though, that this explainer is actually about the colloquial use of \u201chungry\u201d and \u201cthirsty,\u201d not the standard definitions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAh, I see. I never should have doubted you. Just like I never should have eaten that microwaved sashimi for lunch today.\n\nShit. I need to hurry with this explainer, then, because you\u2019re gonna die soon.\n\n\n\nAnyway, in a colloquial sense, \u201cthirsty\u201d and \u201chungry\u201d both mean the same thing. Each term is a way of articulating a person\u2019s ambition. Where they differ is in connotation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow so?\n\n\u201cHungry\u201d describes an ambition that\u2019s rooted in integrity. It implies hard work, diligence and dedication. You\u2019d advise any person attempting to achieve a goal to be hungry. \u201cThirsty,\u201d however, implies desperation. A blind ambition where your goals are suspect and you\u2019re more than willing to make questionable decisions to achieve them.\n\nI see. Can you provide an example?\n\nOf course! Let\u2019s say a high school sophomore wishes to be the starting point guard on the school\u2019s basketball team next year. If he\u2019s hungry, he\u2019s going to spend the entire summer refining his game, lifting weights and getting in better shape. If he\u2019s thirsty, however, he\u2019ll start a rumor that the kid he\u2019s competing with for that starting spot has herpes. And not just herpes herpes, but a rare herpes that can only be contracted through basketball contact.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThirsty niggas invent diseases?\n\nAnd spread unsubstantiated rumors. Shit, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the bubonic plague was caused by a crew of really thirsty sewer rats pissed that the house rats were getting all the cheese.\n\nIs thirst just based on ambition-based actions?\n\nNo. Thirst levels can also be based on why you have a particular ambition. Using the high school basketball player again, if he\u2019s hungry, he wants that starting spot to prove that he deserves it and to be able to compete on the highest levels. Perhaps he even wants to earn a basketball scholarship. If he\u2019s thirsty, he just wants to be a starter to increase his pool for potential prom dates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs it possible to be hungry and thirsty at the same time?\n\nDefinitely! For instance, no one would deny that Drake has an impeccable work ethic. Especially back when he was releasing new mixtapes every few months. He was hungry to establish himself as, well, who he is today. But his actual content, while good (mostly), has always been thirsty.\n\nI mean, how many songs can one person write about \u201cAmber\u201d from \u201cSilver Spring\u201d who \u201cworked at Cheesecake Factory\u201d and \u201chooked you up with extra jalape\u00f1o poppers\u201d and how you always wished you could \u201cescape the world together\u201d but you\u2019re \u201ctoo infatuated with Houston strippers\u201d but still wish, sometimes, that you were \u201cnormal\u201d so you could have your \u201cCheesecake Factory romance\u201d in peace?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDrake is so thirsty, I\u2019m shocked his tonsils aren\u2019t sandpaper. Someone get that nigga an Aquafina!\n\nAnyone else hungry and thirsty at the same time?\n\nMiley Cyrus, whose career seems to be a perpetual vacillation between extreme hunger and extreme thirst. Taylor Swift was hungry once and now needs intravenous fluids. America, for all its faults, was hungry as fuck for a few hundred years. But now this entire country needs some Kool-Aid.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOh, and Jay-Z.\n\nJay-Z?\n\nYeah. As interesting and laudable as 4:44 was, you have to admit that was a thirsty-adjacent album. Like, it wasn\u2019t quite parched, but it probably should have hydrated a bit more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI see. Well, how are the distinctions between hunger and thirst applied to our daily lives?\n\nThe internet, for instance, is a virtual petri dish for unregulated thirst. Like, you know how many cities have created bike lanes on roads, making it easier for people with bikes to travel? Well, the internet is a bike lane for thirsty niggas. Unsolicited DM sliding, unabashed desperation for likes and retweets, performative contrarianism\u2014these are all products of excessive thirst. One day, someone needs to dump the entire internet into a baptismal pool.\n\nThat would need to be a big-ass pool.\n\nI guess the ocean would do. But then we\u2019d have to deal with all of that salt.

Eldest daughter Blue Ivy joined her parents, looking angelic in an age-appropriate white ensemble with a sparkly silver shoe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Carters were clearly ready to slay the Grammys, but alas, there were no wins for 4:44, which found itself shut out of every category it was nominated in thanks to Bruno and Kendrick. And perhaps 6-year-old Blue had an inkling that any expectations of winning should be tempered because she provided one of the most memorable\u2014and hilarious\u2014moments of the night when she motioned for her superstar parents to contain their applause.\n\n\n\nGIF\n\nOn any other child, the gesture might\u2019ve seemed obnoxious, but what else to expect from one born into music superstardom, already with her own freestyle on a platinum-selling and multinominated album? This is far from Blue Ivy\u2019s first appearance on the awards circuit, and we can only imagine how she, as the eldest daughter of the empire, rules the roost at the Carter home.

From Blue Ivy letting us know she runs the Knowles-Carter household, to everyone with white roses in support of Time\u2019s Up, Kendrick Lamar\u2019s American satire and Kesha\u2019s powerful Time\u2019s Up-esque performance (featuring Cyndi Lauper, Camila Cabello, Andra Day and more), taking a stand has become an important thread in the makeup of an artist. \u201cWe come in peace, but we mean business,\u201d said Janelle Mon\u00e1e, carrying the torch for equality for women with her Grammys appearance.\n\nMon\u00e1e shook the table with her speech:\n\nTonight, I am proud to stand in solidarity as not just an artist, but a young woman, with my fellow sisters in this room who make up the music industry\u2014artists, writers, assistants, publicists, CEOs, producers, engineers and women from all sectors of the business. We are also daughters, wives, mothers, sisters and human beings. To those who would dare try and silence us, we offer you two words: #TimesUp. We say time\u2019s up for pay inequality, discrimination or harassment of any kind, and the abuse of power.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGrammy nominees Logic and Khalid, alongside Grammy winner Alessia Cara, performed their powerful nominated song, \u201c1-800-273-8255.\u201d The song, about suicide, was a shift not only in the culture but also in the room, with the performers bringing a group of suicide survivors and family members of suicide victims onstage with them. Logic ended the performance with a stance on immigration policy, saying, \u201cBring us your tired, your poor and any immigrant who seeks refuge.\u201d\n\nTo say there were important moments at the Grammys this year is to make an understatement. Check out some of the best moments from the 2018 Grammys:\n\n\n\nKendrick Opens\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 2018 Grammys opened in a big way with Kendrick Lamar giving us a powerful political performance complete with American flags and marching soldiers. With tears in his eyes, Lamar rapped a mile a minute to songs like \u201cXXX,\u201d \u201cDNA\u201d and \u201cKing\u2019s Dead,\u201d marching alongside the soldiers and introducing us to his satire. The screens behind him read, \u201cThis is a satire by Kendrick Lamar.\u201d Men in red hoodies fell to the ground every time Lamar extended his arm to shoot them.\n\n\n\nAs if that wasn\u2019t entertaining enough, Lamar brought out U2\u2019s Bono and the Edge and Dave Chappelle! Chappelle reminded the audience, \u201cThe only thing more frightening than watching a black man be honest in America is being a an honest black man in America.\u201d Message! Then out came a black female drummer, not only giving you African realness, but sis danced, too! Lamar better give us Motherland! \u201cIs this on cable?\u201d Chappelle asked, because Lamar was out here giving the world the realness.\n\n\n\nBy the time Lamar went onstage, he was already the winner of three Grammys. He won for best rap performance, best rap album and best music video for \u201cHumble.\u201d He and Rihanna also won best rap/sung performance for \u201cLoyalty.\u201d I\u2019m like congrats to Lamar and all, but Rihanna in that monochromatic vinyl moment was worth fawning over.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOh, and I couldn\u2019t get enough of Rihanna busting out the South African dance the gwara gwara!\n\n\n\nThe All-Black Church Choir During Sam Smith\u2019s Performance\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSam Smith was accompanied by a black church choir that stood behind him giving nothing but strong black women who were all fresh out the salon. Sam sang down on his single \u201cPray\u201d as the choir served us Baptist church.\n\nChuck Berry and Fats Domino Tribute\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJon Batiste and Gary Clark Jr. laced the stage with more rock \u2019n\u2019 roll than the Grammys deserved with their Chuck Berry and Fats Domino tribute. Late Show bandleader Batiste\u2019s laid-back style was a perfect complement to Clark\u2019s funky style. From Domino\u2019s \u201cAin\u2019t That a Shame\u201d to Berry\u2019s \u201cMaybelline,\u201d the performance reminded us all of Berry\u2019s and Domino\u2019s undeniable contributions to music.\n\n\n\nBlue Ivy Shushing Mommy and Daddy\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYeah, these front-row seats to the Grammys are great and all, but chill, Mom and Dad, you\u2019re embarrassing me.\u201d We all go through that phase where our parents are less superhero and more super annoying. I wonder what that\u2019s going to look like for Blue Ivy because she clearly runs the entire compound of the Knowles-Carters.\n\n\n\nChildish Gambino Performance\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI felt like I was in the middle of a \u201990s sex scene in a classic black movie. Donald Glover sang \u201cTerrified\u201d and the vibes of the entire show changed. There are moments during many shows when singers bring out their backup singers to riff together. One of the most iconic was when Mariah Carey brought out Trey Lorenz during a performance of \u201cI\u2019ll Be There,\u201d and going forward, everyone wanted to hear that version of the song. Glover brought out child actor J.D. McCrary (who is featured on the song), and he is easily a vocal genius.\n\n\n\nGlover was quietly impressive. He\u2019s well on his way to EGOT territory, as he\u2019s already holding two Emmys and a Grammy. An Oscar and a Tony aren\u2019t far-fetched.\n\n\n\nDave Chappelle Shades Whole Show Over Tribe Called Quest Snub\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDave Chappelle was asked to present the award for the best rap album, and he did so, in a very Chappelle way. He gave several shoutouts, including one to A Tribe Called Quest, calling them all out by name, then making a reference to the group\u2019s 2016 album, We Got It from Here ... Thank You 4 Your Service.\n\n\u201cI have so much love and respect to all the nominees tonight,\u201d Chappelle began, \u201cand I just want to take a moment to honor Jarobi, Ali Shaheed Muhammad, Q-Tip, sometimes Busta, sometimes Consequence and, of course, always and forever Phife Dawg. Can we kick it?\u201d\n\nAnd then Kendrick Lamar won the Grammy, giving him his fifth win for the night! \u201cGod up top all the time,\u201d Lamar said. \u201cI thought it was about the accolades, the cars and clothes, but it\u2019s really about expressing yourself and putting that paint on the canvas for the world to evolve for the next generation and the next.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUgh, Kendrick Lamar for president!\n\n(Sidenote: When Dave Chappelle won the Grammy for best comedy album, mostly what he had to say in his acceptance speech was, \u201cSee you Monday.\u201d)\n\n\n\nCardi B and Bruno Mars Drippin\u2019 in \u2018Finesse\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s hard to watch Cardi B without being excited thinking of her meteoric rise and smiling. I\u2019m just so proud of her, out here getting nominated and performing at her first Grammys! Being nominated up against Jay-Z and Kendrick Lamar is crazy and, yes, \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d still slaps.\n\nIt was great seeing Grammy god Bruno Mars and Cardi kill their In Living Color tribute of a performance on the Grammys stage. Bruno\u2019s dance break hyped the crowd up with the best \u201990s moves you\u2019ve seen since House Party.\n\nShaggy Kept Coming Out With Sting\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSting wants us to know that he\u2019s all about the islands with his new collaboration with Shaggy. From their subway skit (that went on way too long) with the show\u2019s host, James Corden, to their performance, I felt force-fed, but I am honestly curious about this odd couple.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s evidently a joint album coming, and they sang \u201cDon\u2019t Make Me Wait,\u201d which actually does slap. I\u2019m low-key excited for this unlikely pairing. I might be lying.\n\n\n\nShemar Moore and Eve Introducing SZA\u2019s Performance\n\nWhat\u2019s black as hell? Having actor and picture-of-perfection Shemar Moore and rapper and host Eve introducing SZA to the stage for her first Grammys performance. And SZA went off!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd my feelings are a little bit hurt that SZA was the most nominated woman at the Grammys this year and left with nothing. I\u2019m glad she didn\u2019t win for best new artist. We all know that curse.\n\n\n\nFire and Fury Spoken-Word Auditions\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of host James Corden\u2019s skits consisted of various celebrities with not-so-positive opinions on your president sitting down to do dramatic readings of the book Fire and Fury. The lineup was perfect: John Legend, Snoop Dogg, Cher, Cardi B and Hillary Clinton. The skit was glorious.\n\nAnd an honorable mention goes to Cardi B\u2019s red-carpet moment with E! host Giuliana Rancic. When she asked Cardi how she was feeling, Cardi cardi-ed and said: \u201cI\u2019m feeling good. I\u2019m feeling nervous, overwhelmed, everything. Butterflies in my stomach and vagina.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was clear Rancic couldn\u2019t remember the Cardi B lyrics she desperately wanted to summon; nor could she handle Cardi (or Lil Uzi Vert, for that matter), but Cardi handled her own and made for another hilarious, viral moment.\n\n\n\nDid you watch the 2018 Grammys?

It is hurtful, more so. Everyone feels anger. After the anger, it\u2019s really hurtful because he\u2019s like looking down on a whole population of people. You are so misinformed because these places have beautiful people and beautiful everything. It\u2019s just this is the leader of the free world speaking like this. But on the other side, this has been going on. This is how people talk. This is how they talk behind closed doors. It was a moment when Donald Sterling had been exposed as this racist on a private phone conversation that he was having. It\u2019s like, \u201cOK, that\u2019s one way to do it.\u201d Another way would have been to have his team and let\u2019s talk about it together and let\u2019s\u2014maybe some penalties because once you do that, all of the other closet racists just run back in the hole. You haven\u2019t fixed anything. You have sprayed perfume on the trash can. What you do, when you do that is the bugs come and you spray something and you create a superbug because you don\u2019t take care of the problem. You don\u2019t take the trash out; you keep spraying whatever over it to make it acceptable. As those things grow, you create a superbug. And then now we have Donald Trump, the superbug.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe then equivocated a bit, adding, \u201cDonald Trump is a human being, too. ... I\u2019m being funny; I say that, too. Somewhere along his lineage, something happened to him. Something happened to him, and he is in pain and he is expressing it this sort of way.\u201d\n\nTrump responded Sunday morning with the following: \u201cSomebody please inform Jay-Z that because of my policies, Black Unemployment has just been reported to be at the LOWEST RATE EVER RECORDED!\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaybe.\n\nCNN actually fact-checked that stat, and though Trump is technically right, the black unemployment rate remains about twice the rate for white people, what CNN called an \u201cenduring feature of the American labor market.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhy? Scholars attribute the disparity to a combination of factors: hiring discrimination, lower educational attainment and a higher rate of people with criminal records, who are barred from many occupations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo ain\u2019t nothing really change, but cute talking point, Donnie.\n\n\n\nJay-Z also spoke on his marriage to Beyonc\u00e9: \u201cFor us, we chose to fight for our love. For our family. To give our kids a different outcome. You see, to break that cycle for black men and women. To see a different outcome. Like you were saying, it\u2019s not this celebrity couple \u2026 we were never a \u2018celebrity couple,\u2019 we were a couple that happened to be celebrities. We are real people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe #MeToo movement: \u201cIt\u2019s almost like we normalized it. The normalization of the things we have to do to survive. For women to go to work knowing that this sort of abuse was happening every day, you can look logically and say, \u2018Why would you stay there?\u2019 What is the alternative?

The note read, \u201cTo my niggas in Paris\u201d\u2014a quip and a nod, I suppose, to the Jay-Z-and-Kanye song.\n\nNeedless to say, the backlash was swift and harsh, and by Tuesday morning, Sergeenko posted the most hilarious nonapology of all time, except it only served to add fuel to the fire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn this nonapology, the fact that her daughter is part Armenian, and she grew up in a small town in East Kazakhstan, somehow became pertinent information because of her use of the word.

But men and women had very different reactions, to put it lightly.\n\nMany women applauded Jay\u2019s ability to finally take up the mantle of manhood and apologize for his bad behavior; for black women especially, there seemed to be a collective \u201cThank you!\u201d He had violated the trust of Queen Bey, and that was unacceptable. In the aftermath of the release, Candice Benbow\u2019s \u201c4:43\u201d spoke to nearly every black woman I know about what it means for men to finally reckon with honesty and faithfulness\u2014or not to\u2014at the expense of the women they claim to love.\n\nHowever, men weren\u2019t collectively as gracious, and although a 4:44 syllabus created by Anthony Boynton addressed issues of toxic masculinity and manhood, the reception from some men seemed to decry Jay as a \u201csellout\u201d to women. How dare he apologize? Maybe Bey wasn\u2019t doing her \u201cjob.\u201d [Editor\u2019s note: GTFOH.]\n\nWith the appearance of writer and transgender activist Janet Mock as one of the \u201cfounding mothers\u201d in the \u201cFamily Feud\u201d video, I couldn\u2019t help wondering: What are these same men thinking about Jay now?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019ll confess that though I\u2019m a longtime fan of Jay-Z, I\u2019m not a fan of \u201cFamily Feud.\u201d Though Jay rarely has a misstep lyrically, the line \u201cLet me alone, Becky\u201d seems to completely place the blame for his affair or affairs on the infamous \u201cBecky with the good hair\u201d rather than where it squarely needs to be: at Jay-Z\u2019s billionaire feet. In my opinion, it undermines the title track (\u201c4:44\u201d), where he actually apologizes and keeps the attention solely on his fuckboy behavior. So suffice it to say that when the video for \u201cFamily Feud\u201d debuted on Dec. 29, I wasn\u2019t too interested in checking it out.\n\nBut then I thought, \u201cIt\u2019s Jay. I got to.\u201d And I\u2019m happy that I did.\n\nTo start off, the choice to open the video with a quote by James Baldwin\u2014a queer black man\u2014is subversive in its own way. But then, when we time-travel to 2050 and the council of founding mothers, among the many famous faces, we see Janet Mock.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s an interesting vibe when you watch a video intended to reveal a futuristic narrative about families feuding; I read the table of founding mothers as a collective of multihued women \u201csaving\u201d us from ourselves\u2014yet again. Some have expressed concern about the fact that there\u2019s no truly ebony woman at the table, which is an important conversation about colorism that needs to be addressed. And yet seeing Mock at the table as a fully participating part of the healing process made my masculine-of-center lesbian heart leap for joy!\n\nAs I replayed that section of the video, I wondered if Mock\u2019s inclusion was a result of Ava DuVernay\u2019s hand in the process, or was Jay giving a nod to us queer women\u2014cis and trans alike\u2014that yes, I see your womanhood? Hard to tell, but I\u2019ll take that win. Of course, that also means acknowledging the possibility of tokenism, which I\u2019m never in favor of.\n\nIn fact, one could argue that the entire video has moments that give us a wobbly understanding of futurism\u2014possibly Afro but certainly black American: a distinction that is important in the analysis of why it feels very American. For instance, the question of tokenism could also be raised when examining the inclusion of Native American actress Irene Bedard as one of the presidents in this futuristic world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I\u2019d beg to differ; for me, her appearance alongside Omari Hardwick was a reminder of the much-needed conversation that black Americans and Native Americans\u2014both of whom have been uniquely affected by colonization in the social project that is America\u2014need to have. It is important that they are sitting side by side, defending each other and having each other\u2019s backs.\n\nWith that in mind, I\u2019m going to optimistically err on the side of DuVernay\u2019s deft hand and say that tokenism isn\u2019t a part of Mock\u2019s inclusion. She belongs there because she is a woman. I hope Mock\u2019s presence among the founding mothers in this video signifies a shift away from the misogynoir and queer antagonism still present in contemporary hip-hop narratives. Maybe young men will take a note from an elder statesman and begin to understand their regressive ideologies.\n\nBut I can hardly see someone like black activists\u2019 fave Kendrick Lamar doing any work in this area. He can barely speak about cis black women in a positive manner, so I\u2019d be doubly surprised if he attempted to take on embracing queer and trans black women. I wondered as I watched this video\u2014do you have to get to almost 50 years old and out of the price range of Target runs to get some damn sense when it comes to love and womanhood?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI find it telling that embracing queer women on an album where you are finally understanding that black women aren\u2019t the cocoons in which black men find their humanity feels like the next step in an evolution toward manhood.

For my money, few rappers could do what he did (pack that much substance into that many bars for that length of time and perform it so flawlessly) THAT well, and almost all of them are named Eminem or part of Slaughterhouse. I won\u2019t rehash all that he covered; that\u2019s been done already. But what has happened is that it should reignite a convo that exists in the rap community: Just where does Black Thought rank in the greatest-of-all-time conversation?\n\nOver the course of my life, I\u2019ve probably had a thousand \u201cWho is in my top five?\u201d discussions, give or take a hundred or so. At almost no time has Black Thought ever cracked my top five, which typically consists of Biggie, Jay, Nas, Andr\u00e9 3000, and Tupac or Ice Cube (AmeriKKKa\u2019s Most Wanted through Lethal Injection). There aren\u2019t any surprises on that list. It\u2019s a fairly standard \u201cmainstream\u201d list of GOATs.\n\nBlack Thought is as good as or a better rapper than every single person on that list. Yet he almost never makes my personal list, and based on the conversations I have, he typically gets left off a lot of other folks\u2019 lists, too, even extending them to top 10s. There are a few reasons why I think that\u2019s happened.\n\nFor starters, I think because he\u2019s part of such a great collective, the Roots, people sometimes forget to think of him in isolated terms. As an entity, the Roots are super beloved and appreciated, but we always lump them into one. Also because of their \u201cfirst hip-hop band\u201d image, I think sometimes Black Thought gets lost in that shuffle.\n\nWhen we think of the Roots, we think of Black Thought and Questlove, but we think of them in tandem and rarely of Black Thought as just pure rapper. Which is why I think every time he goes on shows and ends up spitting something, it stands out so much more. We are thinking of him as a solo entity in those moments, such as the Flex freestyle. Had Black Thought ever released a solo album, I think that might be different.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSecond, he\u2019s been so consistent for so long, spitting at such a high level, that even when you are paying attention to him, it gets easy to overlook just how skilled he is. Which also gets back to him being lost in the collective, so to speak. They make music that often caters so well to his vocals that he sounds more like an instrument than an MC bodying a track. It\u2019s like D\u2019Angelo on Voodoo.\n\nThe most controversial of reasons is this: He sounds ... unexciting. He\u2019s not a sexy pick. I\u2019m a Black Thought fan, but that everyman-show-up-to-work-every-day-without-any-pizzazz thing tends to push him into the \u201cYeah, he\u2019s tight, but he don\u2019t really spark\u201d convo that people like Tim Duncan fell into. Duncan is the Big Fundamental; his game had very little razzle-dazzle or spark, so it was easy to forget you were watching one of the best to ever do it for so long. Of course everybody knows Duncan is one of the greats, but he\u2019ll end up in those conversations in a more interesting way now that his career is over.\n\nI think Black Thought is similar in that sense. Plain and simple, he\u2019s just that damn good. That freestyle wasn\u2019t a revelation for most of us who are familiar with the Roots. It was a super-skilled MC doing what super-skilled MCs do: They get nasty on the mic. For others it may have been an aha moment, and that\u2019s good for him, and hopefully it translates into new fans for him and the Roots.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNone of the aforementioned reasons is particularly deep, but I think they are all relevant. Rappers in groups do struggle for that individual \u201cbest ever\u201d title, and it\u2019s usually when they step out on their own that we really start paying attention to their greatness. The catch here is that in the Roots, Black Thought has done the vast majority of the heavy lifting with assists from Dice Raw and Malik B., etc. Black Thought is primarily a solo MC in a band that we think of like a group.\n\nBut with freestyles like that one or any time he raps alongside musical guests on Jimmy Fallon or spits freestyles while on talk shows, you get the opportunity to appreciate just how special Black Thought is as an MC, IF he gets lost in the group shuffle. So here\u2019s the important question: Where DOES Black Thought rank in the GOAT convo?\n\nGlad you asked. For me? I think if Nas is in that convo, then so is Black Thought if I\u2019m being reasonable. I actually think Black Thought MIGHT be better than Nas, though Nas will always have Illmatic, which ensures his rap Mount Rushmore status for influence and impressiveness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBiggie will always be in my top five because I don\u2019t think there was a single weakness in his skill set, but I struggle with GOAT because of limited catalog, for obvious reasons. Jay is likely always going to be No. 1 because of how good he\u2019s been for so long and because of his cultural impact and footprint.\n\nBlack Thought, while being easily one of the most skilled rappers to ever do it, doesn\u2019t have the cultural impact piece, THOUGH the Roots are easily one of the most recognizable acts in hip-hop, especially as the backing band for Fallon. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re an unknown outfit. They have platinum and gold albums and six albums that opened in the top 10 on the Billboard pop charts, and 10 albums that opened in the top 10 of the R&B charts. Clearly, they\u2019re a band with a presence and are well-known enough to have an impact. Pretty much any outfit where rap is prominently featured out front and there\u2019s a backing band is following in their footsteps.\n\nHere\u2019s another thing: If you ask any MC who their top MCs are, Black Thought is more often than not going to end up in that number. So his impact is felt and he\u2019s universally respected as one of the best to ever do it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo what\u2019s the point of it all? It\u2019s this: While I think everybody is aware of and knows that Black Thought is a great rapper, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s gotten his just due in the conversations for GOAT. That Flex freestyle is a reminder why he should. If not for the pleasure, at least for the principle.\n\nBlack Thought is one of the best to ever do it; that\u2019s indisputable. Where does he rank on that GOAT list? Only time will tell, but he belongs on it.", "keywords": ["think", "mc", "band", "lists", "high", "roots", "best", "gets", "rap", "thought", "hes", "black", "rank", "goat", "doesnt", "list"], "polarity": 0.16205021211183182, "subjectivity": 0.480274232809444},

After all, women (and black folks) are still engaged in battles for equality, autonomy and respect, including fighting for reproductive rights, combating sexual abuse and harassment in the workplace, and closing the gender wage gap\u2014which, at its current rate, is not projected to close for another 40 years.\n\nAnd like black people, women\u2014many of whom happen to be black, too\u2014deserve more than a month or day when our humanity is universally recognized and celebrated.

The political strategist, former press secretary for Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders and current CNN commentator has become well-known for her show-stealing, straight-shooting, mince-no-words delivery\u2014which is only eclipsed by her deep command of American policy and commitment to progressive politics.\n\nIn short, Sanders isn\u2019t your typical political pundit. Her turn as a player in what was perhaps America\u2019s most contentious presidential campaign in history brought this millennial powerhouse and Girls Inc. alum into our consciousness; refreshingly, she brought her entire self with her. Whatever you think about Sanders\u2019 style or delivery, she is unapologetically herself.\n\nSo when The Glow Up caught up with her during a recent appearance, we had to know: How does she\u2014at the tender age of 28\u2014maintain her selfhood in the predominantly white, middle-aged, male-dominated political sector? Sanders laughed before telling us:\n\nYou know, I\u2019m great now [that] I am getting to walk and live and be my authentic self. And I am out here encouraging black girls, brown girls, girls of all shapes, sizes and colors to walk in their authenticity. Because guess what? Becky and Sarah and whoever else, they get up every single day and they walk in their authenticity. They walk into rooms and they are themselves. And one day, it just clicked for me that I can walk in the room and be myself. So I can walk into the room with the candidates and order Hennessy if I want, because that\u2019s what I\u2019d like to drink. But also, talk to you about American trade policy, and how we have to have trade policies that work for American citizens and American workers, and not policies written by corporations. I can, yes, talk to you about the system of racism, and how racism is not transactional\u2014it is a system that we participate [in] and perpetuate every day. And also talk to you about finance and the tax reform bill, and how it ain\u2019t no reform, it\u2019s tax cuts for the wealthy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Sanders speaks with her now highly recognizable spitfire delivery and passion, she gesticulates, her sparkling gold-painted nails flashing as they punctuate the air. Her lips are painted a deep fuchsia, and around her neck is a small gold-plated plaque that reads \u201cFeminist\u201d\u2014in all caps. She\u2019s a clear anomaly in a sea of conformers (see: Sarah Huckabee Sanders\u2019 post-Trump makeover), but while Symone is well aware of her standout status, she\u2019s also aware that her freedom to be herself is due to generations of women who preceded her:\n\nI\u2019m just excited that I am living in a moment where I have the opportunity, because I am fully aware that there are women who came before me that did not have the opportunities to live and be their authentic selves. They had to put on their \u201cwork voice.\u201d [Imitates work voice.]\n\n\n\nI don\u2019t have a work voice anymore. I don\u2019t need a work voice because the way I show up\u2014authentically myself\u2014is professional.\n\nPhoto: Bennett Raglin (Getty Images for BET)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that Sanders doesn\u2019t face her share of criticisms. But whether she\u2019s being told to \u201cshut up\u201d on national television or that her lengthy, sparkly nails are \u201cunprofessional\u201d (she shouts out Washington, D.C.\u2019s Cosmo Nail Bar for her ever-changing nail art), Sanders is always willing to fight the status quo:\n\nI\u2019m gonna wear myself. ... Someone told me the other day, \u201cWell, these nails are not professional; only nude nails are professional,\u201d and I said, \u201cWhy? Who told you that nude nail polish was the professional nail polish, and that\u2019s what you\u2019re supposed to have on?\u201d Furthermore, me having busy nails does not preclude me from snatching you down with my words and explaining to you what the real is. I can absolutely do my job; I can type, I can do everything I need to do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSanders also expressed concern that current and future generations of black women are still feeling compelled to adhere to white beauty and professional codes in order to succeed. The former blond\u2014now famous for her side-parted fade\u2014challenges the assertion that there is exclusively one mode of professional dress, let alone that there should be no place for personal expression or style as a professional black woman:\n\n[Y]oung black women still think that a standard of whiteness is what they have to ascribe to to be successful. So that lets me know that it is really important that I step out\u2014every time I go to work\u2014as my authentic self. I want young black girls to know that you can be bald and still be beautiful. I want young black girls to know that you can go to work and not have to agree with everything your white co-workers say. You can go to work and be your authentic self. You can show up and have nails, and they\u2019ll still respect you. Because they respect me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Joshua Blanchard (Getty Images for Politicon)\n\nAnd as for that \u201cFeminism\u201d necklace? Sanders is very clear on when and where we\u2019ve entered American feminism and the culture at large. After all, it was built on our backs:\n\nMy definition of feminism is I believe in equity, not equality\u2014but equity for women in all spaces and places. And as a black woman, I have to be a feminist. Again\u2014in my Angela Rye voice\u2014we built this joint for free, and black women have shown up throughout history. In all the major moments in history, black women have been behind the scenes\u2014or maybe even at the forefront\u2014we just haven\u2019t gotten our due. So I am empowered to walk in this feminism space, because as a black woman, it\u2019s a space that I deserve to be in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd while black women are well-known for saving the day\u2014whether in daily life or political elections\u2014Sanders warns against continuing to succumb to our superwoman tendencies. Zora Neale Hurston may have mused that black women have long been \u201cthe mules of the world,\u201d but Sanders considers our moment long overdue:", "keywords": ["symone", "power", "girls", "professional", "women", "style", "signature", "know", "american", "work", "sanders", "walk", "fearlessfriday", "black", "truth", "speaks", "nails"], "polarity": 0.11797650761936478, "subjectivity": 0.4053671725100295},

This is a book for women who expect to be taken seriously and for men who take grown women seriously. This is a book or women who know shit is fucked up. These women want to change things but don\u2019t know where to begin.\n\nThe power and the urgency behind those words reminded me of the first time I met Brittney. In 2015, we were part of a panel at Harvard on race and the media (Panama Jackson and Kimberly Foster from For Harriet were also there). Within the first five minutes of the conversation, I wanted to get up and take a seat in the audience. That\u2019s how long it took for me to realize that everything I planned to say and every point I\u2019d try to make, Brittney could say better and more powerfully, and somehow more succinctly and more descriptively.\n\nI was spellbound and, to be honest, a little shook. I\u2019d never seen someone meld the academic and the colloquial together so seamlessly while speaking with such a stream of consciousness fury and verve. It felt like watching the world\u2019s best Baptist preacher but with sermons about intersectionality and Beyonc\u00e9 instead of Ecclesiastes.\n\nI shared this memory with her and the audience during our talk at Politics and Prose in Washington, D.C., Wednesday evening and asked where she gets that power. She laughed and claimed that she had no idea what I was talking about. And then, five minutes later, after she delivered an impassioned and witty and funny and heavy articulation of her journey to accept and channel the same rage she\u2019d been loath to embrace, I turned to the audience and said, \u201cSee what I mean?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, Eloquent Rage is a book about feminism. Its subtitle reads, A Black Feminist Discovers Her Superpower. It is also a book about the Williams sisters, Howard University, Judy Blume books, white tears and dozens more topics she weaves through while explaining how and why she is who she is. Brittney Cooper is Brittney Cooper because she has to be. That we also need her to be matters, too, but not as much.\n\nOut of those dozens of themes and topics, two had a particular resonance with me. The book\u2019s fourth chapter, \u201cThe Smartest Man I Never Knew,\u201d excavates her relationship with her father, who led a remarkably full and remarkably tragic life. In attempting to grapple with how this man could be so abusive to her mother (and such a deadbeat to Brittney), yet so worldly and intellectually curious and so empathetic to everyone except the people who most needed him to be, Brittney intersects his story with what she now understands about toxic masculinity\u2014specifically how racism and capitalism and sexism and America converge to damage black men.\n\nBut while she explains why her dad and many, many, many others like him came to be the way they are, she doesn\u2019t excuse their behavior and the effect it has on the women (and men) in their lives. Yet throughout that refusal to excuse their behavior, she stops short of damning and discarding. And as someone who\u2019s also writing a book\u2014a book that prominently features and attempts to understand my dad\u2014parts of this chapter felt like they were sitting directly on my chest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrittney also repeatedly reflects on and nods to the importance and the power of friendships with other black women. In an excerpt published by Cosmopolitan two weeks ago, she connects this to her feelings about Beyonc\u00e9 and her place in modern feminism.\n\nFrom \u201cWhy Feminism Needed Beyonce\u201d:\n\nFriendships with black girls have always saved my life. I give the side eye to any black woman who doesn\u2019t have other black women friends, to any woman who is prone to talk about how she relates better to men than to women, to anyone who goes on and on about how she \u201cdoesn\u2019t trust females.\u201d If you say fuck the patriarchy but you don\u2019t ride for other women, then it might be more true that the patriarchy has fucked you, seducing you with the belief that men care more about your well-being than women do.\n\nIt isn\u2019t true. I came up in an era when black girls loudly proclaimed that they didn\u2019t have friends. They had associates. It has always rung false to me, maybe because the introverted parts of me had absolutely no interest in spending sustained time fake-grinning at people with whom I couldn\u2019t be my whole self. I wanted friends to snicker, giggle, and pass notes with, to share secrets with. I wanted people who would have my back. I worry about a world in which black girls on their way to becoming women are taught to distrust women. We wonder why young men hate women and, sometimes, the sad truth is that their mamas and aunts and sisters act as an arm of the patriarchy by parroting the refrain that \u201cgirls simply can\u2019t be trusted.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe book is littered with references to friends pulling her aside and pulling her card and setting her straight as well as celebrating and encouraging and supporting and amplifying her, and her doing the same for them. Brittney makes clear that the black women who are her friends are as vital to her as plasma.\n\nAnd, well, she is not alone.", "keywords": ["power", "girls", "women", "lifesaving", "coopers", "men", "homegirls", "friends", "book", "rage", "wanted", "brittney", "black", "eloquent", "say"], "polarity": 0.06768292682926826, "subjectivity": 0.47615418118466885},

If Ruth could pop it for Boaz, I don\u2019t understand why we\u2019re still having True Love Waits and Pinky Promise ceremonies and conferences.\n\nSecond, I believe sexuality is a part of creation and all of creation is deemed good by God.

Where do we go to be spiritually fed and find community?\n\nI am one of the lucky ones. I have a great relationship with my pastor, and he knows where I stand on certain issues. His position on many things mirrors my own, and when we don\u2019t necessarily agree, we talk about it. He\u2019s interested in and values my perspective.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore joining his congregation, I told him I couldn\u2019t attend a church that disparages single mothers, demonizes LGBTQ individuals, stigmatizes mental health and lacks nuance when approaching black women\u2019s sexuality. Those are my deal breakers, and I recognize how privileged I am to be able to have and vocalize them as such.\n\nBut the sad truth is, if my pastor had not been open to hearing my theological perspective and had not already fostered a church community where I could see myself, there wouldn\u2019t be much that I could do. Sunday after Sunday, so many of us have to shut off and compartmentalize parts of ourselves in order to make it through the message\u2014or we just stay home.\n\nEven social media hardly amplifies the voices of progressive black Christian women. Sisters who have a progressive look with a traditional message saturate the market. They embrace their curves and the beauty of their bodies\u2014something the church frowns upon\u2014while still telling black women that \u201csoul ties\u201d are real and having sex outside of marriage equates to torturing our spirits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know and love many of these women. On the surface, it would seem that our theological views are as different as night and day. Yet, off the record, many of them will say, \u201cI agree with you but could never say that publicly.\u201d\n\nAnd as frustrating as that is, there is a cost to being labeled \u201cprogressive.\u201d The requests to speak and preach at conferences aren\u2019t plentiful. Your access to some of the platforms that helped sustain your faith can become restricted. And more than anything, if you are labeled a progressive church girl, your faith isn\u2019t taken seriously. It\u2019s always assumed that you value your education over a personal experience with God. That couldn\u2019t be farther from the truth.\n\nThere are many of us who can discuss how problematic it is that black Christians glory in the violence of the cross and plead the blood of Jesus over our lives. We denounce patriarchy, asserting our God-given bodily autonomy and submit to the spiritual leadership of our pastors who may be cisgender, heterosexual black men. We have Audre Lorde on our bookshelves and a hymn in our hearts. We live at the intersection of our feminism and faith. And more than anything, we are not going anywhere.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor us, remaining connected to our churches is a theological and black feminist commitment. Black church space is black women\u2019s space, and we deserve to be there like everyone else. It would behoove our pastors and leaders to stop acting as if we are invisible.

Microaggressions become too much? Poverty a pain in the ass? Racism got you fucked up?\n\n\n\nWell, black women, there\u2019s now a place to place all of your justifiable but sometimes \u201cproblematic\u201d anger, an actual depository to just vent, let loose and scream (or text) your ass off like Nola Darling did in a recent episode of Spike Lee\u2019s She\u2019s Gotta Have It reboot on Netflix.\n\nWe know that as African Americans and women, black women face the double dig of both gender and racial oppression. But because of racialized labels like the \u201cangry black women\u201d as well as socialization to just grin and bear it, black women often swallow or internalize their anger, where it festers and seeps out in destructive ways. Or, too often, when we express anger, we\u2019re dismissed as being emotional.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut one University of California, Berkeley, doctoral student, Malika Imhotep, 24, has created a space, the Bank of Hysteria, to deposit (ahem) the wrath that so many of us feel.\n\n\n\nImhotep explains her idea in a callout for participants:\n\nToo often, those angry voices are dismissed as irrational, but we think that anger is valid and should be heard. 510-985-9986 is the number to the Bank of Hysteria Toll-Free Rage Hotline. Call and/or text to invest in your anger. Leave an honest message, say the things you\u2019ve been holding in for fear of being labeled as \u201cangry\u201d or \u201ctoo emotional.\u201d What angers you? What enrages you? What people, places or things have tried your patience or attempted to silence you? Let us help you invest in your rage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImhotep says that the Bank of Hysteria grew out of a course she\u2019s taking on ways of using new media tools to produce socially engaged art projects. Imhotep says she was placed in a group focused on gender.\n\n\u201cAnd we started to think about what are the ways we could intervene in popular discourse,\u201d Imhotep told The Root. \u201cWhat is it about women of color, femmes, nonbinary folks that doesn\u2019t get affirmed? Their anger. What does it mean to always be called angry or too emotional or to be written off and not allowed to access that?\u201d\n\nImhotep says that in light of the social unrest and drama on Berkeley\u2019s campus over the past year, her group deemed it necessary to \u201ccreate ways to validate and give platform to anger\u201d\u2014especially from women. Particularly from black women.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAs black women especially these days, you\u2019re so worried, you\u2019re so preoccupied with the way people read anger and intimidation before you even say anything, and then when something actually unnerves you, you have to negotiate all these different things like, well, they already think I\u2019m about to pop off, so how do I go about expressing myself?\u201d she says.\n\n\n\nImhotep says that Audre Lorde\u2019s \u201cThe Uses of Anger: Women Responding to Racism\u201d speech, given at a feminist conference in 1981 (and also found in the seminal black feminist text Sister Outsider), informed a lot of the project. Lorde gave voice to the fact that often her response to racism is anger, but so often she was not able to express it, which can be destructive to the spirit.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe actual name of the project came from women being dismissed as hysterical, and the creators\u2019 desire for women to invest in that anger, which led to the banking metaphor. It also riffed on \u201cBank of America.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cSo what we\u2019re doing and constructing, kind of like, is a simulated bank-teller booth, and we\u2019ll be printing out rage receipts,\u201d says Imhotep. \u201cWe\u2019ll then be taking all the responses, and so the installation will be a rolling scroll ... of rage receipts of the responses, mixed with some creative use of the receipts on a wall.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe project creators\u2014Imhotep, Jess Liu, Becca Milman and Phyllis Thai\u2014also made pins and Bank of Hysteria credit cards, and say the first iteration should go up Dec. 6. But that is only the first phase. Imhotep says that the project will live on (so keep calling and texting) and may appear again at a later date.\n\nInitially, Imhotep says, because the campus is where they initially advertised the project, the first commentary was around transgressions in classroom spaces, with comments such as, \u201cPeople say I don\u2019t look like I major in computer science, but I do and it makes me angry.\u201d But after seeing commentary such as, \u201cI\u2019m still angry about slavery,\u201d she knew she wanted to reach out to black women specifically, who have a complicated relationship with anger.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat I understand personally and from an academic standpoint is that there are ways that we\u2019re forced to view and interact with ourselves as black people and as black women, which creates a fragmentation,\u201d Imhotep explains. \u201cAnd that fragmentation has been talked about by people who have experienced mania, seasonal affective disorder or just \u2018I don\u2019t feel good.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nShe continues, \u201cI think folks bottle it up, and it manifests in serious health issues; or you see people who cannot bottle it up, and that\u2019s when they get labeled as erratic and problematic. Or, somehow, less than respectable.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut in a phrase, Imhotep says, \u201clet it out\u201d\u2014like Solange in her song \u201cMad\u201d\u2014because holding on to anger can be destructive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAt some level, part of what this project [is] is giving folks the space to vent ... helping black folks put a pressure valve on all these things that get contained,\u201d she says. \u201cAt least symbolically.\u201d\n\nTo participate, call or text 510-985-9986 for the Bank of Hysteria Toll-Free Rage Hotline.", "keywords": ["imhotep", "think", "hysteria", "women", "vent", "handscall", "dont", "throw", "bank", "project", "black", "anger", "angry", "ways"], "polarity": -0.15384771677875123, "subjectivity": 0.4692547714099437},

She loves her country but hates the direction in which it\u2019s headed. Corruption is rampant. The leadership talks a good game about democracy, but at times, she says, it feels like a dictatorship. Though with a new, pro-Western government in office, Diash felt she at least had freedom of expression.\n\nHer harsh reality check came last week when she was arrested after baring her breasts in protest during a ceremony where Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko signed documents of cooperation between their countries. Human rights abuses are rampant in Belarus, which former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice once called \u201cthe last dictatorship\u201d of Central Europe. Diash believed that Poroshenko didn\u2019t need to be seen shaking hands with someone most of the world thinks is a tyrant.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDiash made her way into the ceremony last Friday afternoon, bared her breasts with \u201clong live Belarus\u201d written on them and began shouting the phrase. The refrain is commonly used by the Belarusian opposition against Lukashenko. Two large men dressed in black suits quickly whisked her out of the packed ceremony as journalists snapped photos, shot video and looked on.\n\n\n\nLukashenko and Poroshenko grinned calmly. Watch the video of Diash\u2019s protest for yourself:\n\nAfter sharing a jail cell with three other women overnight, she was released the following morning and placed in a holding cage in court, where she heard the stiff charges against her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt most, Diash figured she\u2019d get arrested, be slapped with a small fine and be released after a few hours. Instead she faces between two and five years in prison for \u201chooliganism with aggravating circumstances,\u201d according to the Kyiv Post. The police allege that she resisted arrest as she was carried out of the ceremony\u2014thus the stiff jail time. Diash denies that claim.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not normal,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m really frustrated. [Ukraine] wants to move toward Europe. The United States supports us. We want democracy to develop in our country, but our authorities show that they are not ready. Don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening with them. I\u2019m really surprised.\u201d\n\nDiash is part of a feminist group called Femen, whose members are known for staging protests by showing their breasts. Founded in Ukraine in 2008, the group of \u201csextremists,\u201d as they are called, made a name for themselves protesting against the Ukrainian and Russian governments in this manner. Their tactics drew reactions ranging from curiosity to outright hostility. As the group continued their protests and gained international coverage, the Ukrainian government began cracking down on them, and its key members were forced out of Ukraine. Femen is now based in Paris.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI met Angelina in Ukraine during my Fulbright program in 2009, and she participated in my \u201cBlack Women in Ukraine Photo Project,\u201d which you can find here. Diash has always been passionate about political and social justice issues in her country and has never been shy about discussing the racism she deals with.\n\nAnd that is what makes Diash\u2019s current case unique: She is a black woman in Ukraine fighting against what she feels is creeping authoritarian rule, all while fighting against racism from her own people. When news of her arrest hit social media, the language people used toward her wasn\u2019t pretty.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe says some of the comments included, \u201cWhy is a black monkey protesting in our country?\u201d and of course, the universal slur for black people: \u201cnigger.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really frustrating that people judge me by the color of my skin,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of black people in Ukraine, especially those who were born here.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDiash was born in western Ukraine to a Ukrainian mother and an Angolan father who studied in Ukraine during the 1980s on a Soviet scholarship. In her small town, she was one of a few black kids, and their classmates were quite cruel. Schoolchildren would tell them they should feel cold because they were outside of Africa. They were constantly called \u201cNegros.\u201d\n\nAs hurtful as the taunts were, Diash didn\u2019t allow it to break her spirit. In 2009 she sat through a college lecture where a professor said that mixed-race children had a \u201cbad gene\u201d that made them criminals. Worst of all, the professor was her adviser and had to sign off on her graduation papers. Furious, Diash stormed to the professor\u2019s office and demanded that she explain the science behind her logic. Of course, the professor could not.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen the Euromaidan protests against former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych took place at the end of 2013, Diash was on the streets in the freezing cold with millions of other Ukrainians demanding a new government. Government forces shot at protesters, killing dozens. When Yanukovych fled to Russia and a more Western-minded leadership took over, Diash was optimistic that the new government would transition the country out of its authoritarian past.\n\n\u201cBut as I see, it\u2019s not true,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I do not know why all of those people were dying and standing in the rain. And now they want to put me in the prison. I made a protest action,\u201d she added, emphasizing that she was peaceful and feels the charges against her are extreme.\n\n\n\nDuring our 30-minute conversation on Facebook video, Angelina sounded confident, but she admitted she is very scared and doesn\u2019t want to go to prison.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer mother supports her activism but was reduced to tears after realizing her daughter could get five years for a protest that lasted less than 20 seconds. She planned on attending her sister\u2019s wedding in Chicago in September, but her passport has been confiscated, and her travel is reduced to Kyiv.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t know her court date, which is further exacerbating her anxiety. It is Diash\u2019s hope that the case will be dismissed soon and she\u2019ll be able to see her sister, whom she hasn\u2019t seen in over a year.\n\nI asked her if she regrets the protest and if she\u2019d do it over again. Without hesitation, she said \u201cyes\u201d to doing it over. Even though many Ukrainians do not see her as one of their own, Diash is resolute. Ukraine is her country, and she doesn\u2019t plan on leaving. She is a black feminist Ukrainian patriot who risked her life protesting with millions of other Ukrainians for a better future. Diash won\u2019t abandon her country now\u2014even if it means serving prison time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf she is thrown in prison, Diash says, it will prove that Ukraine is not the free and open society it claims to be.\n\n\u201cIt will really show how truly our country is moving towards democracy,\u201d Diash said. \u201cAnd [it will prove] how interested the authorities are in being in Europe and being a normal country.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: We have reached out to the Ukrainian National Police and Diash\u2019s lawyer for comment and will update this article with their remarks.", "keywords": ["country", "prison", "breasts", "protest", "diashs", "faces", "ukraine", "baring", "called", "diash", "ukrainian", "woman", "black", "really"], "polarity": -0.024741280044310338, "subjectivity": 0.4291861617619193},

After an hour and a half, I emerged with a tiny Egyptian cross etched between my least favorite parts of my body\u2014my breasts. It was a daily reminder not to ignore them and to finally start to embrace them. It\u2019s safe to say I felt like Rihanna standing in the bathroom mirror post-shower, angling my phone to take the ever popular \u201csexy bathroom-mirror\u201d pic. That picture is also still in my phone.\n\n\n\nThe few times I attempted to post it on Instagram, or TwitPic it, I decided against it. Truthfully, I was afraid. I feared that after posting, I would certainly be called a thot or receive a few \u201cR U OK?\u201d text messages. I convinced myself that I didn\u2019t have to be the needy millennial stereotype that uses social media to seek validation. I was convinced that my photo would be labeled just another thirst trap that served no other purpose than to call attention to myself.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut if we define body positivity as a movement dedicated to embracing all bodies, we aren\u2019t always talking about the ones fully clothed. What you send to future bae or post online on a Thirst Trap Thursday is a form of activism. Yes, activism. This is also why we need thirst traps online; they help shape a more inclusive narrative about body positivity and can inspire other women of color to act in ways that are liberating on their terms.\n\nCollectively, we\u2019ve been trained to believe that openly sexual women pose a threat to social movements and, therefore, should be kept separate. This is why you are more likely to see people call Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201cBad Blood\u201d video a feminist battle cry and write off Nicki Minaj\u2019s opinion on why \u201cAnaconda\u201d wasn\u2019t nominated at the MTV Video Music Awards as divisive. Minaj critiqued how black women\u2019s bodies are hypersexualized or shamed, but the focus was how she chose to address it. However, it is women like Minaj and Amber Rose who push the envelope enough to start the right conversations.\n\nWhen a woman isn\u2019t so famous, their nudes may not get the same level of admiration that fame grants. But with a simple search of body-positive hashtags like #CelebrateMySize, you can find solid examples of why activism can and should be provocative. Not only did this hashtag tackle body positivity in a very personal way, but many women posted photos of themselves that could easily be posted on a #WCW or be considered a thirst trap.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsider sex coach and advocate Tyomi Morgan. By simply embracing her body, she\u2019s empowering and teaching others how to do the same:\n\nBut according to Morgan, there is a clear difference between a thirst trap and body positivity. In a brief email, she defined thirst trap as \u201c[a] photo or post that is placed on one\u2019s social media page with the intention of eliciting a response from potential partners or paying patrons.\u201d However, a thirst trap\u2019s ability to pull people in is how Morgan creates dialogue about sensuality.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very aware of how people are drawn in by the naked body, and I use my posts as a way to grab attention, and once I have it, I follow up with a meaningful message with the intent of enlightening, inspiring and encouraging,\u201d she said.\n\nTo Melanie Ennis, the term \u201cthirst trap\u201d is \u201cdripping with misogyny\u201d because it is usually used as a tool to shame women online. Ennis viewed the difference between a thirst trap and a body-positive post as being more about our inability to accept women\u2019s liberation on their terms.\n\n\u201cWhile we\u2019re taught that one is acceptable and one isn\u2019t. I think the difference between the terms is if I love my body and share it (whether I note that in the caption or not) I can\u2019t help what the viewer thirsts after,\u201d she wrote in an email.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor marginalized women, Twitter and Instagram are spaces to discuss and dismantle layers of oppression, but those women need space and acceptance to do it on their terms. And users like Ennis and Morgan are using these spaces to embrace their bodies regardless of what others deem \u201cappropriate.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d said Ennis. \u201cI do believe we are existing in a special time, and social media has a lot to do with black women being able to share our beauty, on our own terms with each other and the world.\u201d\n\nUltimately, what demotivates women trying to explore self-acceptance and liberation is slut-shaming and respectability politics. So any time a black woman has the confidence to post the most intimate parts of herself online, that is a public declaration of self-love and resistance. Instead of shaming that woman for her approach, be honest with yourself about why it annoys you or makes you uncomfortable.\n\n", "keywords": ["thirst", "women", "traps", "morgan", "social", "online", "post", "trap", "positive", "positivity", "ennis", "body"], "polarity": 0.1580094537815126, "subjectivity": 0.5149439775910365},

That\u2019s why we\u2019re grateful that International Women\u2019s Day exists, to pull us out of our own beauty- and fashion-obsessed heads, for a least a day.\n\n\n\nBut we\u2019d like to make that broader focus last more than just today\u2014and last at least all month, since it\u2019s also Women\u2019s History Month. When we thought about how we wanted to celebrate International Women\u2019s Day, we thought we should focus on something that has an ongoing positive impact in women\u2019s lives. Fittingly, we settled on something that also happens to be one of our favorite activities: shopping.\n\nThis year\u2019s International Women\u2019s Day theme is \u201cTime Is Now: Rural and Urban Activists Transforming Women\u2019s Lives.\u201d Notably, there are fashion brands and entrepreneurial initiatives around the world doing the work of supporting and empowering women around the world. So don\u2019t just drop a dollar; drop gems by spending your money with female entrepreneurs who are trying to turn the world around, one thoughtful purchase at a time.\n\nMalawi is one of the poorest countries on the planet, where only 33 percent of school-age children ever attend school. In Chichewa, Malawi\u2019s native language, tiwale means \u201clet us shine/glow.\u201d This youth-led, community-based organization, founded by DJ, artist and one of Forbes\u2019 Africa\u2019s 30 Under 30 Ellen Chilemba, has a stated mission of \u201cempowering women to develop sustainable ventures that transform our communities from poverty-stricken to entrepreneur-vital.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTiwale runs programs providing school grants and mentorship, training, microloans and even a blog featuring African female writers. The goods produced are for sale on its site; 40 percent go back to the participants of the program, while the remaining 60 percent support Tiwale\u2019s programming.\n\nThis charity and brand creates ethical and sustainable womenswear and lifestyle items, produced in the Mayamiko Fashion Lab in Malawi by the team of tailors, pattern cutters and seamstresses the label trains and employs through fully funded workshops. Founded by Paola Masperi, the Mayamiko Fashion Lab \u201cwas designed to provide training, education, nutrition, sanitation and fairer trade practices to all of those involved ... many of whom are affected by the HIV pandemic or who are carers of HIV orphans. After their training all trainees receive a recognized qualification as well as mentoring, guidance and access to a microfinance scheme, enabling them to start their own business.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd for those who choose to stay on with Mayamiko, the label pays living wages \u201cso that more people can be employed and lifted out of poverty.\u201d\n\nWouldn\u2019t you love to start a business doing something you love that, in the process, takes care of black women and their families? That\u2019s exactly what Liya Kebede, the Ethiopian supermodel, actress and mother of two, did when she founded Lemlem, a handwoven-clothing brand for men, women and children with fair-trade production headquartered in Ethiopia\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLemlem means \u201cto bloom and flourish\u201d in the Ethiopian language of Amharic. Lemlem is committed to elevating artisanship and expanding production and jobs across Africa. In a quote from Kebede on the brand\u2019s official website: \u201cBy employing traditional weavers, we\u2019re trying to break their cycle of poverty, at the same time preserving the art of weaving while creating modern, casual, comfortable stuff that we really want to wear.\u201d Access to education, health care, fair wages and safe working conditions, and you can get this in exchange for wearing some really cool-looking comfortable clothes? That\u2019s smart shopping.\n\nIn Africa, shea butter is called \u201cwomen\u2019s gold.\u201d Why? Because 16 million women make a living in West Africa picking the nuts that become shea butter. Shea Radiance, founded in 2010 by a Nigerian-American mother on a quest to treat her kids suffering from eczema, embodies the phrase \u201ccharity begins at home.\u201d By taking care of the needs of the few, she created a means to take care of many.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy March of 2013, the company website reports, Shea Radiance had trained more than 300 small businesses to \u201cThink Global and Act Local\u201d through a selection of workshops, including soap making, formulation, access to finance, business plan development and marketing.\n\nShea butter is an incredible gift to women on so many levels: from the shea producer in the village to the small-business owner who manufactures products for the local market.\n\nLeila Janah\u2019s mission is \u201cto give work.\u201d As a self-taught skin-care aficionado and founder and CEO of the global poverty-fighting nonprofit Samasource, Janah\u2019s latest venture is LXMI (pronounced \u201cluxe-me\u201d), a skin-care company based on the rare nut butter (and relative of shea) nilotica, which is available on LXMI\u2019s site and QVC and at 300 Sephora locations worldwide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJanah first encountered nilotica while visiting Uganda, and immediately saw its potential. With sourcing from the banks of the Nile, and by employing local harvesters and fair-trade practices, this skin-care brand is great not just for your skin but also for your ethical impact, as its website states:\n\nIn fact, we promise that for each of our primary ingredient harvests, our producers earn at least 3x the local average wage. These living wages will help chip away at some of the world\u2019s most serious problems, from childhood malnutrition to human trafficking.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGlobal Goods Partners launched in 2005 as a not-for-profit social enterprise with a commitment to providing sustainable jobs for women. Since that time, it has partnered with women-led, community-based organizations and over 60 artisan groups in more than 20 countries throughout Africa, Asia and the Americas.\n\nIts products are handcrafted by artisans who make a fair living wage for each product they produce, as well as have access to training and funding to sustain their own enterprise. The company has also awarded more than $150,000 in financial grants to its partners around the globe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShoe designer Aurora James is a darling of the business of global luxury fashion accessories, and she did it by helping black women in Africa live and work with dignity. James earned her stripes in the fashion world traveling the globe with her mother, who sourced hard-to-find, unique artisan fashions for wealthy clients in New York, London and Paris.\n\nBrother Vellies\u2014which comes from the South African slang term for a man\u2019s flat shoe, a stock staple of her collection\u2014employs weavers, cobblers and Maribou feather-makers from one end the African continent to the other. James\u2019 commitment to fair-trade practices and using African artisans proves that while most of us don\u2019t know the struggle that our African brothers and sisters face on the daily, we can help change their lives by walking a mile in their shoes.\n\nClothed in Hope\u2019s mission is \u201cto empower women in Zambia through education and economic opportunity.\u201d It does that by helping women create sustainable businesses through offering a yearlong life-skills-training program in sewing and entrepreneurship; development focusing on women\u2019s empowerment; education to vulnerable women in health, disease prevention and nutrition; providing microloans to assist in launching independent, sustainable businesses; and marketing and selling Zambian-designed and -produced accessories and home goods to help women generate income.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince its launch in 2012, more than 254 women have joined its life-skills-training program, over 75 have received microloans to start businesses (with a 100 percent repayment rate), and over 888 children have benefited as a result of the empowerment of their mothers.\n\nAble is a lifestyle brand that promises \u201cbeautiful products by women who have overcome.\u201d Its mission is \u201cfocused on ending generational poverty by working with women who have often overcome extraordinary circumstances. [It] manufacture[s] directly in the communities [it] wish[es] to impact, both locally and globally, creating jobs and ending the cycle of charity dependency.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnderstanding that the fashion industry is the third-largest industrial industry in the world, and that of its 60 million employees, over 75 percent are women, Able began while founder Barrett Ward was visiting Ethiopia and saw the effect of generational poverty on young women, often forced into prostitution to support themselves and their families. Able now prides itself on disrupting that cycle through its empowering and transparent business practices, saying:\n\nWhether your purchase is produced in Ethiopia, Mexico, Peru or at our headquarters in Nashville, Tenn., each item has one thing in common: through working with women, it is leading all of us a step closer to the end of generational poverty. With your help, we are working each day to give opportunity to women in a safe and healthy environment and encouraging our peers to do the same.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n", "keywords": ["sustainable", "support", "poverty", "drop", "women", "womens", "brands", "fashion", "shea", "globally", "africa", "mission", "day", "african", "international", "shop", "world", "working"], "polarity": 0.18128485628485627, "subjectivity": 0.40984555984555976},

It is a terrifying task trying to raise aware, radical, loving, confident black children in a white supremacist society that tells them every day that their lives do not matter\u2014a white supremacist capitalist society that tells our children the only value their lives hold is what can be used in the service of sustaining institutionally discriminatory systems intended to destroy them.\n\n\n\nAnika Simpson, associate professor of philosophy and women\u2019s and gender studies at Morgan State University, and founder of Beyond Policy LLC, has made it her mission to disrupt those toxic narratives by intentionally raising her daughter in black feminist traditions.\n\nAnd she has seen the results.\n\n\n\nRead Simpson\u2019s letter to The Root below:\n\nThree mothers gathered our school aged daughters in my living room to begin their induction into the joy and wisdom of black feminist traditions. The urgency of our endeavor was clear from the start. Many of our girls had already begun to question the glory of their kinky hair, the beauty of their brown skin, and the significance of their voice. We have sustained our expanding Black Girl Feminism gatherings over the years to ensure that our daughters are confident in themselves and understand their power to influence the world around them. \u200bThe impact of this feminist work was revealed when our daughters came together in an act of resistance against our threatening political and social climate. Their experience of anti-black racism and sexism had caused feelings of anxiety, fear, and anger. In response, my oldest daughter wrote a poem inspired by the contemporary black liberation movement that has most deeply influenced her politicization: Black Lives Matter. The girls developed the poem into a video project and invited their diverse friends to support their insistence upon the dignity of black children. \u200bA childhood marked by #blackgirlmagic is indeed delightful. But we also have a responsibility to empower our children with #blackgirlfeminism. There is no greater gift for me this Mother\u2019s Day than the assurance that our daughters are connected to the historical legacies of black feminism and are prepared to carry the torch forward.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is what revolutionary black love looks like.\n\nWatch the video below:", "keywords": ["mothers", "lives", "women", "black", "white", "blackgirlfeminism", "intentional", "video", "daughters", "day", "children", "feminist", "raising"], "polarity": 0.10583333333333338, "subjectivity": 0.4604166666666667},

She\u2019s cute, probably in her mid-20s, although life has prematurely etched the signature of age across her face and carriage.\n\nShe\u2019s a mama to four sons, none of them more than 5 or 6 years old, all absolutely adorable, stair-jumping, ripping-and-tearing, running-and-climbing, question-asking, vibrant little things. They dip and duck between her calves when she stops to unlock the front door, too animated by their little-boy joy to care that their high-velocity play is making their mom\u2019s long day feel about 24 hours longer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the evenings, she escapes to the stoop or the stairwell to smoke cigarettes and stare silently out at nothing in particular, offering up a whispery \u201cHi\u201d when I or anyone else squeezes by her but rarely saying much more than that.\n\nMost days, she has a hair-trigger temper. Her hollering voice breaks the early-morning quiet when my windows are open in the spring and summer, and in the colder, more closed-in months, I can still make out the muffled sound of her displeasure wafting through the floorboards underfoot.\n\nI wish she didn\u2019t cuss her kids as if they were grown men. I wish she didn\u2019t threaten, snatch and swat them at the slightest provocation. I wish her happiness hadn\u2019t been defeated by helplessness. But at the same time, I empathize with her. Sistergirl is stressed.\n\n\n\nFrom the few conversations we\u2019ve had, I understand that she\u2019s underemployed when she does find work; she relies on the services of local agencies to keep her children healthy and fed; and she receives a voucher through Section 8, whose future is always facing certain uncertainty. She\u2019s an apparition in a social order where your worth is determined by your affiliations, credentials and accomplishments. So like most people who are caged into forced silence and abject insignificance, she vents her frustration in the one place in the world where she has any kind of control: the inside of her home.\n\n\n\nHers is not an isolated representation of women in my neighborhood, an enclave of blackness in a city that is being chewed and swallowed by gentrification. It is the hood by stereotypical definition. I jokingly call it that myself sometimes. But it\u2019s also one of the most authentic-feeling parts of Washington, D.C., where, at the happy hours and social mixers that are part of its dichotomous culture, you\u2019re assessed within seconds of casual conversation by where you went to school, which neighborhood you live in and what you do for a living.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn this community, don\u2019t none of that matter. People share expressions of love because you look like them. Days ago, an SUV coughed to a stop at a red light during rush hour and I watched several gentlemen, all strangers to one another, work in seamless unison to push it and its young driver to curbside safety. The news will tell you about the area\u2019s violence, folks from swankier sections of the DMV will crack their dusty jokes about Southeast\u2019s storied dangers, but love is big and omnipresent here.\n\n\n\nStill, the boot heel of pervasive brokenness and cyclical brokenness presses down on folks in the community who struggle to make a life for themselves and stretch what income they have across the fifth-highest cost of living in the country. As always, poverty is the king of impediments. The unemployment rates (pdf) in wards 7 and 8, making up the Southeast quadrant, are 11 and 13 percent respectively, two to three times higher than most of the other parts of D.C. and almost three times the 4.7 percent national rate.\n\nPrograms to assuage those rates, when they\u2019re allowed to even exist, are perpetually overextended. Waiting lists are inevitable. Lines form early at the doors of the Department of Human Services offices, way before the sun fully brightens the sky and the government employees who will ultimately manage the needs and demands of the waiting people walk inside the building to start the day.\n\n\n\n\n\nI just want all of us to be spoken for, especially those of us who, like my neighbor, have been habitually forgotten, left behind and undervoiced as they struggle against the far-reaching effects of poverty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese are scary, ugly times, and for folks who were already having hardships, the future is tense. In less than 100 days in office and a few scribbly pen strokes, Disaster 45 has purposely dismantled the life\u2019s work of activists, advocates, politicians, presidents, lobbyists and organizations to put millions of people in some kind of peril of some kind of loss, from health care coverage to reproductive rights to safe living spaces.\n\nHe is not only smoothing the foundation for tyranny in his administration but is also setting up his brand of wild, unapologetic, calculating leadership to clench control of the country for untold numbers of years to come. It is formulaic dictatorship. To rage against the machine means we are going to have to work strategically in focused clusters to advance our agendas and zealously protect them.\n\n\n\nI appreciate the mobilization of black feminists and womanists and women who choose not to get caught up in either of those sometimes-distracting labels and differentiations but do the work nonetheless. I just want all of us to be spoken for, especially those of us who, like my neighbor, have been habitually forgotten, left behind and undervoiced as they struggle against the far-reaching effects of poverty. Even if it doesn\u2019t directly burden our respective households, it impacts the climates of many black communities, and that, in and of itself, should matter to us.\n\n\n\nOf the categorically poor, 22 percent of women with insurance and 57 percent of women without it have needed to see a doctor but couldn\u2019t afford to go, a cost prohibition to basic health needs and self-care that creates a chain reaction of emotional, behavioral and financial crises in households overwhelmingly managed by single mothers. Low-income women are more vulnerable to unwanted pregnancy, with few feasible alternatives, because the Hyde Amendment doesn\u2019t allow abortions to be covered by federally funded insurance plans like Medicaid in 35 states and Washington, D.C. They\u2019re also more often trapped in abusive situations because of a lack of resources and are less likely to have safe, affordable housing options, particularly in cities where that\u2019s a general challenge for everyone.\n\nA study of a housing project in Fulton County, Ga., found that 42 percent of the black women living there had been forced into unwanted sex because they were either threatened with violence or actually assaulted. Forty-two percent. In one housing project. And, in that same study, women revealed that because they were already just trying to survive in those volatile living situations, they were too scared to ask their partners to use condoms. So they didn\u2019t. In not doing that, they and women in similar situations are more at risk for contracting HIV, potentially deepening their entrapment in a cycle of dependency, fear and oppression.\n\n\n\nWe can only help other sisters when we listen to and prioritize their unique needs and experiences. I worry that the increasing intellectualization that fortifies feminism and womanism doesn\u2019t then go out and touch the reality of black women who are not formally educated or reaping the financial benefits of it if they are. I worry that education is a paralytic of privilege that actually immobilizes folks and puts some at risk for self-congratulatory, ivory-tower thinking instead of actually doing and moving and engaging with our people most in need.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI worry that we\u2019ve been slowly closing ourselves off into a class-based, upwardly mobile elitism that both insulates the conversation and isolates another experience of black womanhood from sitting at the table and being counted. I worry that we\u2019re so distracted by the \u201cghetto\u201d behavior that some consider laughable and distasteful that we don\u2019t consider issues rooted in low self-worth that require empathy and healing.\n\nAll of us have an obligation to make sure that the spectrum of black womanhood is represented and that those of us who have access create access for those of us who don\u2019t.\n\nElitism is so pervasive that there\u2019s no space it doesn\u2019t intrude on and create divides within. Black feminism and womanism is no exception. We\u2019ve already been susceptible to the \u201cI\u2019m a better feminist than you\u201d debate. Remember when folks wouldn\u2019t count the pre-Lemonade Beyonc\u00e9 as a member of the team because she didn\u2019t dress, act or dance feminist enough for them?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHigh-level concepts like intersectionality and agency have their place. But they mean nothing if they can\u2019t translate to the hood to help women who have never heard of bell hooks and wouldn\u2019t know Patricia Hill Collins if she greeted them on the stoop they congregate on. If they fail to trickle down from the upper echelons of academia to the basement-level apartment of a struggling single mother with no diploma and four babies to raise in Southeast D.C., have they really done their job? If the work that we\u2019re doing isn\u2019t wholly empowering to make life better for her, is it elitist? It\u2019s a question I ask but am waiting to answer.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s a quote from the awesome Gwendolyn Brooks that goes, \u201cWhat I\u2019m fighting for now in my work [is] an expression relevant to all manner of blacks, poems I could take into a tavern, into the street, into the halls of a housing project. I don\u2019t want to say these poems have to be simple, but I want to clarify my language.\u201d That\u2019s what I want for black feminism and womanism: to be relative, inviting and comprehensible to every woman.\n\nSome of us are at our best in academic study. Some of us are gifted fire starters who willfully make up the offensive and defensive front lines, depending on the situational needs. Some of us can turn intellectual discourse into on-the-ground activism. All of us have an obligation to make sure that the spectrum of black womanhood is represented and that those of us who have access create access for those of us who don\u2019t. When we do that, when we take those elevated concepts and put them to work to make them tangible and real, we forge a movement to help low-income and low-wage-earning women better care for their kids, their spouses, their communities and, most important, themselves. It\u2019s always been critical, but with (T)Rump playing the part of Goliath, it\u2019s literally lifesaving.\n\n\n\nI stand for the sisters who\u2019ve been forgotten, the sisters who are the brunt of hood-chick memes and jokes, the sisters selling food stamps for money because cash benefits don\u2019t stretch far enough. I stand for sisters who buy gas with loose change, sisters who keep a new hustle, sisters who dodge bill collectors and get notices of cut-off dates in brightly colored envelopes. I stand for sisters with criminal records and those still incarcerated, sisters who had babies young and didn\u2019t know how to be themselves so they kept becoming Mommy, sisters who\u2019ve never heard of code-switching and have nothing to prove by using it. I stand for sisters who would run away from home but have nowhere else to go, sisters who keep a hair-and-nail appointment even when they\u2019re broke because it\u2019s the one way they can feel good about themselves, sisters who embarrass the progeny of the affluent Talented Tenth.\n\n\n\nI stand for sisters who wake up weighted by trauma, baby mamas doing the best they know how to raise one and two and three and more kids by one and two and three and more fathers and feel the judgment of other folks because of it. I stand for sisters who feel trapped by their circumstances, throwaway sisters no one wanted to invest in, sisters who are angry because they\u2019ve spent their lives being heard only when they scream and holler. I stand for sisters who can\u2019t afford to dream, sisters who had a dream that was snatched from them, and sisters who never had a dream but who want desperately to find something worth hanging their hope on. For the brokenhearted, the frustrated, the marginalized, the light-filled, the soulful, the loving, I am here. I hope we all are.", "keywords": ["arent", "sisters", "feminism", "worry", "women", "serve", "work", "folks", "dont", "table", "needs", "didnt", "black", "stand"], "polarity": 0.1107507241435813, "subjectivity": 0.4739522299790155},

We know white supremacy to be a feminist issue on the most intimate and painful level because systemic oppression has always been mapped on the bodies of black women.\n\n\n\nOur communities have been covered in sheets of our blood for generations. Our families have been ripped apart with precision by the vicious consistency and cruel mundanity of whiteness. We bear layers of scars, and our anger cannot be washed away or marched away, or defined by knitted, pink pussy hats.\n\n\n\nThis is the reality, the hot, seething reality, that is being diminished by some people in current conversations around the Women\u2019s March on Washington, D.C.\n\n\n\nAs resentment and defensiveness swelled during the organizing of the march, there were white women who voiced concerns that some black women were bullies\u2014too angry, too demanding and too divisive.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese were all code words for \u201cthe real racists.\u201d\n\n\n\nEmma-Kate Symons, writing for the New York Times, called it a hijacking: \u201cIt saddens me to see the inclusive liberal feminism I grew up with reduced to a grab-bag of competing victimhood narratives and individualist identities jostling for most-oppressed status.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis is what white, liberal, feminist racism sounds like\u2014the blatant and self-serving refusal to acknowledge that white women have always been complicit in the oppression of women of color. They have been beneficiaries and perpetrators of a genocidal system that continues to shape-shift in transparent attempts to disguise itself.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe terror that Donald Trump has induced as the dystopian state he promised becomes reality is palpable. And with it comes the expectation that black women must fold our anger, resentment and mistrust into something that will not singe the fragility of white women.\n\n\n\nBecause now just isn\u2019t a convenient time.\n\n\n\nDespite the racially fraught origins of the march, many women of color marched on Jan. 21 to stand in solidarity against Trump; others went to ensure that white women did not control the dialogue and lay sole claim to women\u2019s rights; others went to start that good trouble.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMillions of women across the nation\u2014black, white, Latinx, Asian, indigenous, cisgender and transgender, able-bodied and disabled, Christian, Muslim and atheist\u2014were inspired by the historic show of women\u2019s power and the magnitude of its potential.\n\n\n\nHowever, there are black women who noted that anti-blackness was on full display. This was most clearly evident in the self-congratulatory photos of attendees with police officers rocking pink pussy hats and the triumphant reports that there were no arrests made.\n\nThere were no tanks, no clubs and no water hoses. Jovial police officers came out in full force to protect white womanhood, positioning the march as a propaganda tool for the state. The dangerously dishonest contrast being that Movement for Black Lives activists and Standing Rock water protectors must have instigated and enflamed the state-sanctioned violence and continued threats against them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack women are not surprised.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something they almost brag about. \u2018No one was arrested. The police gave us high-fives,\u2019\u201d Ferguson, Mo., protester Johnetta Elzie told the Boston Globe. \u201cThe people I\u2019ve seen saying that are white women, and that\u2019s really spoken from a complete place of privilege.\u201d\n\n\n\nRace, gender and class influence every interaction with police. And this reality places black women in potential danger on a daily basis. With Donald \u201cLaw & Order\u201d Trump continuing his antagonist stance against the Movement for Black Lives, fighting back against the violence that black women experience at the hands of the state should have been a top priority. More than likely, though, little thought was given to the fact that women of color often live in occupied territories at the mercy of rapists and killers who hide behind badges.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to a 2007 report prepared for the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, The Nation reports, \u201cRape and sexual abuse by police [in the United States] are primarily reported by women of color.\u201d\n\nSexual misconduct is the second-highest form of police misconduct in the nation after excessive force. \ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c[B]lack women are routinely killed, raped and beaten by the police,\u201d wrote Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw, director of Columbia Law School\u2019s Center for Intersectionality and Social Policy Studies and co-founder of the African American Policy Forum, in the 2015 report #SayHerName: Resisting Police Brutality Against Black Women.\n\n\n\n\u201cInclusion of black women\u2019s experiences in social movements, media narratives and policy demands around policing and police brutality is critical to effectively combating racialized state violence for black communities and other communities of color,\u201d she emphasized.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile women of color, black women specifically, have pushed our issues to the forefront, there has still been too much chatter about white women\u2019s feelings. How they feel about black women \u201cmaking this about race.\u201d How they feel about being forced to reckon with their toxic brand of Whites-Only Feminism\u2122, the destruction it has caused and the discriminatory institutions it has fortified.\n\n\n\nLet there be no doubt: Dismissing the anger and betrayal that some black women are experiencing is violent. Mocking and misidentifying the decision made by some black women to practice self-care this one time by not attending the march as self-righteous performance radicalism is violent.\n\n\n\nThe recognition that some white women are only as radical as the risks they personally face is necessary. And that recognition does not require lecturing black women on the uselessness or incompleteness of their anger.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAudre Lorde, in her 1981 keynote address, \u201cThe Uses of Anger: Women Responding to Racism,\u201d said that women must not be seduced into \u201csettling for anything less than the hard work of excavating honesty; we must be quite serious about the choice of this topic and the angers entwined within it because, rest assured, our opponents are quite serious about their hatred of us and of what we are trying to do here.\u201d\n\n\n\nLorde continued:\n\n\n\nEverything can be used / except what is wasteful / (you will need / to remember this when you are accused of destruction). ... To those women here who fear the anger of women of color more than their own unscrutinized racist attitudes, I ask: Is the anger of women of color more threatening than the woman-hatred that tinges all aspects of our lives? It is not the anger of other women that will destroy us but our refusals to stand still, to listen to its rhythms, to learn within it, to move beyond the manner of presentation to the substance, to tap that anger as an important source of empowerment. I cannot hide my anger to spare you guilt, nor hurt feelings, nor answering anger; for to do so insults and trivializes all our efforts ... my anger is no excuse for not dealing with your blindness, no reason to withdraw from the results of your own actions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is critical that white women understand that solidarity will not happen on their terms, which too often includes a pre-emptive softening of anger. And women of color should understand that if it does, it will not last.\n\nBlack women and white women can\u2014and often do\u2014stand together when there is acknowledgment that whiteness comes with structural privileges and power, but there must be relentless efforts to dismantle it brick by brick.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf the women who voted in the presidential election, 94 percent of black women voted for Hillary Clinton, some with great trepidation. They deserve space to say that they feel betrayed by the 53 percent of white women who voted for Trump\u2014and the silent accomplices smiling in their faces. Further, the estimated 1 to 2 percent of black women on the left who did not vote for Clinton deserve space to say that a frantic return to the neoliberal politics that Clinton embodies cannot be the goal, or we will continue this ceaseless cycle through different iterations of white American evil.\n\nAnd we have the right, indeed, the duty, to express anger while we say it.\n\n\n\nWe have the right, indeed, the duty, to question whether or not this new resistance will outlast the white supremacist and misogynist regime we now find ourselves under.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe have the right, indeed, the duty, to call out the racism embedded in time itself. We lose time with loved ones to the prison-industrial complex. We lose time with our children because many of us have to work tirelessly to make ends meet. We lose years of our lives because of the stress of navigating a world that hates us for our freedom.\n\nAnd we are constantly told by some white women to just hold on because progress is slow but assured, while they reap the benefits of their whiteness. That is not what sisterhood looks like.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou always told me it takes time,\u201d James Baldwin said in 1989\u2019s The Price of the Ticket. \u201cIt\u2019s taken my father\u2019s time, my mother\u2019s time. My uncle\u2019s time, my brothers\u2019 and my sisters\u2019 time. My nieces\u2019 and my nephews\u2019 time. How much time do you want ... for your progress?\u201d\n\nThere are black women who are sick and tired of being the mules of the world, sick and tired of holding in anger and hoping that it won\u2019t metastasize and eat us alive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe may have reached a juncture where progress is measured by liberal white urgency, but their sudden sense of urgency alone is not a sufficient exchange for more of our time\u2014neither is cosmetic diversity. If multiracial, multicultural, queer-led, feminist coalitions rooted in a working-class, anti-imperialist politic is the endgame, then we must not dismiss the transformative and clarifying power of anger because it makes some white women uncomfortable.\n\n\u201cI cannot hide my anger to spare you guilt, nor hurt feelings, nor answering anger; for to do so insults and trivializes all our efforts.\u201d\n\nIn a nation where blackness is often considered a threat punishable by death, anger can be the catharsis that leads to revolutionary action. Indeed, where black folks have been told to be grateful, patient, forgiving, kind and obedient in the face of relentless white supremacist violence, openly and unapologetically embracing anger can be revolutionary. And that anger should not be diluted for a whitewashed progress that has no room or desire to hold it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is a fire that needs to be nurtured, not extinguished\u2014and may intersectional and intentional solidarity be forged in the flames.\n\n\n\nI urge those white women who are angry in response to black women\u2019s anger to be angry. I urge those white women who are hurt to be hurt. I urge those white women who are frustrated to be frustrated. They need to own their discomfort, become familiar with it, trace its patterns and discover its origin, then decide what they want to do with it. And they need to do so clear in the knowledge that time does not solely belong to them.\n\n\u201cHow much time do you want ... for your progress?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey need to be clear that not all white women are the enemy, but whiteness always is.\n\nMy grandmother used to tell me, \u201cIt\u2019ll all come clean in the wash.\u201d So, what if we discover that the anger, hurt and frustration that some white women feel in the face of black women\u2019s justifiable anger leads them to take their fickle, feminist balls and go home?\n\n\n\nThen they were never to be trusted in the first place, and all women committed to freedom and liberation are better off without them.", "keywords": ["arent", "hurt", "women", "supremacy", "womens", "whiteness", "white", "uses", "color", "told", "radical", "violence", "black", "anger", "enemy"], "polarity": -0.09824703074703066, "subjectivity": 0.39131035631035666},

Kennedy Library and Museum in Boston held a special exhibit celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Jacqueline Bouvier and John F. Kennedy nuptials. Visitors got to see various mementos from the 1953 wedding, considered the social event of the season at the time. A highlight of the exhibit was Bouvier\u2019s ivory silk-taffeta bridal dress, which received a lot of media attention for its exquisite design. It also sparked renewed interest in the woman who made it: Ann Lowe, a little-known African-American designer who specialized in formal wear for wealthy socialites.\n\n\n\nPhoto: AP Images\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI first learned about Ann Lowe years ago when I went up to what was then the Black Fashion Museum in Harlem,\u201d recalls Valerie Steele, fashion historian and director of the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City, where several of Lowe\u2019s dresses are housed. \u201cWhat struck me was that she was a custom dressmaker to elite, white society, which was a significant genre,\u201d says Steele.\n\n\n\n\u201cI love my clothes and I\u2019m particular about who wears them,\u201d Lowe famously told Ebony magazine. \u201cI am not interested in sewing for caf\u00e9 society or social climbers. I do not cater to Mary and Sue. I sew for families of the Social Register.\u201d The story of how she became one of their most sought-after designers is quite remarkable.\n\nDelaware Public Media/YouTube\n\nBorn in 1898 in Clayton, Ala., Lowe came from a family of dressmakers. Her grandmother Georgia Cole made clothes for her plantation mistress before becoming a free woman in 1860, and her mother, Jane Lowe, was an expert seamstress and embroiderer. Learning from both women, Lowe became skilled at creating intricate fabric flower adornments that would later become one of her signatures. The women eventually moved to Montgomery, Ala., where they ran a successful dressmaking business. When her mother died suddenly while making gowns for the governor\u2019s wife and daughters, Lowe, then 16, completed the project and subsequently headed the family business.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA wealthy Floridian impressed with Lowe\u2019s skills invited her to move to Tampa and become her family\u2019s seamstress. As word of her talent spread, her clientele increased.\n\n\u201cThere have always been black women who were dressmakers,\u201d says Audrey Smaltz, former Ebony Fashion Fair commentator and founder of the Ground Crew backstage management company. \u201cIf they had a dressmaking job in a white lady\u2019s house and that lady was looking good, she would also subcontract the dressmaker out to others. That\u2019s how black women got to be seamstresses. They\u2019d work for one family and maybe that family would help her [become established].\u201d\n\nWith her employer\u2019s support and encouragement, Lowe enrolled at the S.T. Taylor School of Design in New York. She studied alone in a separate classroom because white students did not want to attend class with a \u201cNegro.\u201d Ironically, her designs were often upheld as examples in the same classes she was forbidden to attend, and she successfully completed her two-year design program in half the time. Lowe returned to Tampa, opened a shop, and hired 18 seamstresses to help her keep pace with requests for balls, cotillions and other formal affairs. Business was good, but Lowe was eager to fulfill her dream of working in New York City. Taking $20,000 in savings, she closed shop and headed north.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Great Depression hit soon after she arrived in the city. To make ends meet, she took work designing and sewing for prestige labels like A.F. Chantilly and Sonia Gowns. Those jobs were her introduction to New York society\u2014and its introduction to her\u2014though its members wouldn\u2019t immediately know it, because the labels on her creations bore the company\u2019s name.\n\n\n\nLowe\u2019s career really took off during the prosperous postwar years when wealthy women flocked to the opera, theater and galas and needed the appropriate attire. Debutante balls were growing in popularity as well, so there was a new generation of socialites to design for. \u201cThe girls were coming out in those days, and she was so good at making cotillion dresses,\u201d Smaltz says. \u201cShe had lots of upper-echelon clients\u201d\u2014du Ponts, Roosevelts, Rockefellers, Whitneys, Posts, Bouviers and Auchinclosses among them.\n\nLowe opened Ann Lowe\u2019s Gowns in Harlem in 1950, and Ann Lowe\u2019s Originals on Manhattan\u2019s Madison Avenue in 1968, making her the first African American to have a business on the high-end retail strip.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA 1966 Saturday Evening Post article called Lowe \u201cSociety\u2019s Best Kept Secret,\u201d a description that Steele says could be a double-edged sword. \u201cOn the one hand, people really liked her work. On the other hand, they weren\u2019t exactly boasting that this beautiful dress they had was made by an African-American designer,\u201d Steele says. \u201cThey probably would have been just as happy to have people think, \u2018Oh, maybe she\u2019s wearing Dior.\u2019 It didn\u2019t help her business that people weren\u2019t talking her up.\u201d\n\nAnother detriment to business was that Lowe, succumbing to pressure from clients, often sold dresses for much less than they were worth. Mounting business debts and back taxes forced her to declare bankruptcy and shutter her first store in the early 1960s. Thanks to an anonymous benefactor who paid off her debts, Lowe rebounded and continued to work at her Madison Avenue store until her retirement in 1972.\n\nThanks to some recent efforts, Lowe is having another fashion moment. An exhibit of her dresses at the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C., is exposing thousands of visitors to her legacy and artistry. Julia Faye Smith\u2019s 2016 biography, Something to Prove: A Biography of Ann Lowe, America\u2019s Forgotten Designer, filled with archival pictures, puts Lowe\u2019s life and career in historical context.

On- and off-camera, her boundary-pushing, bourgeois-bohemian style was the stuff teenage fashion dreams were made of.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThirty years later, the actress\u2014while sadly no longer a regular on our TV screens\u2014is more of a muse than ever, and not only to handsome husband (and Aquaman star) Jason Momoa (or ex Lenny Kravitz). Now 50, in addition to a yogi\u2019s body and some seriously chiseled cheekbones, Bonet still possesses that mysterious aura, which she\u2019s passed down to daughter and second-generation style icon Zo\u00eb Kravitz (who also got considerable charisma from her rock-star dad, too).\n\nSo when Net-a-Porter\u2019s Porter Edit gained access to our forever muse on the remote California ranch she shares with Momoa, their younger children and several animals (including wolves and a donkey), we were all in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the resulting article featured a long-awaited comment on those Bill Cosby allegations, the accompanying editorial gave us a glimpse into the idyllic all-natural life we\u2019ve imagined Bonet living for the past couple of decades (you can read the entire article here). But it wouldn\u2019t have been complete without the perfect earth-mother-meets-haute-hippie wardrobe, which looks flawless on Bonet, and which we\u2019ll be emulating as soon as temps allow.\n\nOf course, Net-a-Porter provides easy-to-buy links to the wardrobe used in Bonet\u2019s shoot, full of gauzy fabrics, full sleeves, flowing skirts and simple jewelry. Prices range from $45 for gold-plated earrings to $995 for a ruffled silk georgette dress. But since our budgets are bit more\u2014cough\u2014modest, we did a little sourcing of our own, hoping to put our perfect summer wardrobe in place before the mercury rises.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScouring fast-fashion faves like Anthropologie and ASOS, we found an array of Bonet-worthy dresses and separates, in a decent range of sizes. Our faves? From ASOS, a plunging Grecian-styled maxi dress ($42) and corsetlike denim top with a puffed sleeve detail ($60).\n\nAnthropologie also had some easy, breezy options, albeit at a higher price point. But there were definitely a few pieces we could see wearing all summer long, bringing our cost per wear to pennies on the dollar. Think a fit-and-flare dress with a drawstring waist ($289) or a gauzy, off-the shoulder jumpsuit ($199).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the real winner in our search for Lisa Bonet-levels of bohemian chic? Festival-favorite retailer Free People, which had more options than we could possibly begin to list here. But a few dresses went straight to the top of our shopping lists, including a backless, ruffled midi dress in a canyonlike hue ($98), a slubbed-cotton midi with a plunging neckline and tied sides ($108), and a seriously sexy ribbed-knit maxi gown with full sleeves ($98) that looks as comfortable as it is current.\n\nBut while dresses may be our summer go-to for easy, effortless fashion, Free People comes through with the separates, too. We\u2019re especially fond of its top-and-skirt sets, made for matching and paired as a blouson top and flippy miniskirt ($78), a button-fronted skirt and cropped blouse ($108), or a full and flowy skirt with a brief and boxy top ($128)\n\nIf you\u2019re just looking for a few pieces to update your already well-established summer wardrobe, consider a blousy top in an unexpected hue ($148) to pair with pants or jeans, incorporating details like embroidery into a breezy blouse ($128) or coupling the full-sleeved trend with smocks and stripes ($88) or a casual riff on the corset trend ($58) that was all over the 2018 runways.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd, yes, we know that the temps are currently barely above freezing throughout most of the U.S., but we also know spring is mere weeks away, and sundress season is therefore not far behind.\n\nSo whether shopping for a new seasonal capsule collection or shopping in your own closet, maybe the best advice is to channel a woman who clearly has excellent taste.

I endeavor to provide employment for hundreds of the women of my race.\u201d \u2014Madame C.J. Walker\n\nHere at The Glow Up, we\u2019ve made it our mission to empower and inspire all iterations of black women. But admittedly, we can sometimes get a bit myopic and materialistic when covering fashion shows and the latest looks on the red carpet. That\u2019s why we\u2019re grateful that International Women\u2019s Day exists, to pull us out of our own beauty- and fashion-obsessed heads, for a least a day.\n\n\n\nBut we\u2019d like to make that broader focus last more than just today\u2014and last at least all month, since it\u2019s also Women\u2019s History Month. When we thought about how we wanted to celebrate International Women\u2019s Day, we thought we should focus on something that has an ongoing positive impact in women\u2019s lives. Fittingly, we settled on something that also happens to be one of our favorite activities: shopping.\n\nThis year\u2019s International Women\u2019s Day theme is \u201cTime Is Now: Rural and Urban Activists Transforming Women\u2019s Lives.\u201d Notably, there are fashion brands and entrepreneurial initiatives around the world doing the work of supporting and empowering women around the world. So don\u2019t just drop a dollar; drop gems by spending your money with female entrepreneurs who are trying to turn the world around, one thoughtful purchase at a time.\n\nMalawi is one of the poorest countries on the planet, where only 33 percent of school-age children ever attend school. In Chichewa, Malawi\u2019s native language, tiwale means \u201clet us shine/glow.\u201d This youth-led, community-based organization, founded by DJ, artist and one of Forbes\u2019 Africa\u2019s 30 Under 30 Ellen Chilemba, has a stated mission of \u201cempowering women to develop sustainable ventures that transform our communities from poverty-stricken to entrepreneur-vital.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTiwale runs programs providing school grants and mentorship, training, microloans and even a blog featuring African female writers. The goods produced are for sale on its site; 40 percent go back to the participants of the program, while the remaining 60 percent support Tiwale\u2019s programming.\n\nThis charity and brand creates ethical and sustainable womenswear and lifestyle items, produced in the Mayamiko Fashion Lab in Malawi by the team of tailors, pattern cutters and seamstresses the label trains and employs through fully funded workshops. Founded by Paola Masperi, the Mayamiko Fashion Lab \u201cwas designed to provide training, education, nutrition, sanitation and fairer trade practices to all of those involved ... many of whom are affected by the HIV pandemic or who are carers of HIV orphans. After their training all trainees receive a recognized qualification as well as mentoring, guidance and access to a microfinance scheme, enabling them to start their own business.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd for those who choose to stay on with Mayamiko, the label pays living wages \u201cso that more people can be employed and lifted out of poverty.\u201d\n\nWouldn\u2019t you love to start a business doing something you love that, in the process, takes care of black women and their families? That\u2019s exactly what Liya Kebede, the Ethiopian supermodel, actress and mother of two, did when she founded Lemlem, a handwoven-clothing brand for men, women and children with fair-trade production headquartered in Ethiopia\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLemlem means \u201cto bloom and flourish\u201d in the Ethiopian language of Amharic. Lemlem is committed to elevating artisanship and expanding production and jobs across Africa. In a quote from Kebede on the brand\u2019s official website: \u201cBy employing traditional weavers, we\u2019re trying to break their cycle of poverty, at the same time preserving the art of weaving while creating modern, casual, comfortable stuff that we really want to wear.\u201d Access to education, health care, fair wages and safe working conditions, and you can get this in exchange for wearing some really cool-looking comfortable clothes? That\u2019s smart shopping.\n\nIn Africa, shea butter is called \u201cwomen\u2019s gold.\u201d Why? Because 16 million women make a living in West Africa picking the nuts that become shea butter. Shea Radiance, founded in 2010 by a Nigerian-American mother on a quest to treat her kids suffering from eczema, embodies the phrase \u201ccharity begins at home.\u201d By taking care of the needs of the few, she created a means to take care of many.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy March of 2013, the company website reports, Shea Radiance had trained more than 300 small businesses to \u201cThink Global and Act Local\u201d through a selection of workshops, including soap making, formulation, access to finance, business plan development and marketing.\n\nShea butter is an incredible gift to women on so many levels: from the shea producer in the village to the small-business owner who manufactures products for the local market.\n\nLeila Janah\u2019s mission is \u201cto give work.\u201d As a self-taught skin-care aficionado and founder and CEO of the global poverty-fighting nonprofit Samasource, Janah\u2019s latest venture is LXMI (pronounced \u201cluxe-me\u201d), a skin-care company based on the rare nut butter (and relative of shea) nilotica, which is available on LXMI\u2019s site and QVC and at 300 Sephora locations worldwide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJanah first encountered nilotica while visiting Uganda, and immediately saw its potential. With sourcing from the banks of the Nile, and by employing local harvesters and fair-trade practices, this skin-care brand is great not just for your skin but also for your ethical impact, as its website states:\n\nIn fact, we promise that for each of our primary ingredient harvests, our producers earn at least 3x the local average wage. These living wages will help chip away at some of the world\u2019s most serious problems, from childhood malnutrition to human trafficking.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGlobal Goods Partners launched in 2005 as a not-for-profit social enterprise with a commitment to providing sustainable jobs for women. Since that time, it has partnered with women-led, community-based organizations and over 60 artisan groups in more than 20 countries throughout Africa, Asia and the Americas.\n\nIts products are handcrafted by artisans who make a fair living wage for each product they produce, as well as have access to training and funding to sustain their own enterprise. The company has also awarded more than $150,000 in financial grants to its partners around the globe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShoe designer Aurora James is a darling of the business of global luxury fashion accessories, and she did it by helping black women in Africa live and work with dignity. James earned her stripes in the fashion world traveling the globe with her mother, who sourced hard-to-find, unique artisan fashions for wealthy clients in New York, London and Paris.\n\nBrother Vellies\u2014which comes from the South African slang term for a man\u2019s flat shoe, a stock staple of her collection\u2014employs weavers, cobblers and Maribou feather-makers from one end the African continent to the other. James\u2019 commitment to fair-trade practices and using African artisans proves that while most of us don\u2019t know the struggle that our African brothers and sisters face on the daily, we can help change their lives by walking a mile in their shoes.\n\nClothed in Hope\u2019s mission is \u201cto empower women in Zambia through education and economic opportunity.\u201d It does that by helping women create sustainable businesses through offering a yearlong life-skills-training program in sewing and entrepreneurship; development focusing on women\u2019s empowerment; education to vulnerable women in health, disease prevention and nutrition; providing microloans to assist in launching independent, sustainable businesses; and marketing and selling Zambian-designed and -produced accessories and home goods to help women generate income.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince its launch in 2012, more than 254 women have joined its life-skills-training program, over 75 have received microloans to start businesses (with a 100 percent repayment rate), and over 888 children have benefited as a result of the empowerment of their mothers.\n\nAble is a lifestyle brand that promises \u201cbeautiful products by women who have overcome.\u201d Its mission is \u201cfocused on ending generational poverty by working with women who have often overcome extraordinary circumstances. [It] manufacture[s] directly in the communities [it] wish[es] to impact, both locally and globally, creating jobs and ending the cycle of charity dependency.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnderstanding that the fashion industry is the third-largest industrial industry in the world, and that of its 60 million employees, over 75 percent are women, Able began while founder Barrett Ward was visiting Ethiopia and saw the effect of generational poverty on young women, often forced into prostitution to support themselves and their families. Able now prides itself on disrupting that cycle through its empowering and transparent business practices, saying:\n\nWhether your purchase is produced in Ethiopia, Mexico, Peru or at our headquarters in Nashville, Tenn., each item has one thing in common: through working with women, it is leading all of us a step closer to the end of generational poverty. With your help, we are working each day to give opportunity to women in a safe and healthy environment and encouraging our peers to do the same.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n", "keywords": ["sustainable", "support", "poverty", "drop", "women", "womens", "brands", "fashion", "shea", "globally", "africa", "mission", "day", "african", "international", "shop", "world", "working"], "polarity": 0.18128485628485627, "subjectivity": 0.40984555984555976},

Do you think you know the entire trajectory of the megastar from her being a child of destiny to being Queen of the Beyhive, including the details of her pre-Lemonade cornrow era, the exact shade of her shimmering stage tights and the length of her longest lace front?\n\nIf you are that fan, then perhaps you\u2019ll understand the value of this rare opportunity: Currently up for auction is a collection of circa-1992 videotapes documenting the star\u2019s rise\u2014with appearances from then-bandmates Kelly Rowland, LaTavia Roberson and LeToya Luckett, of course.\n\nTouting two-and-a-half hours of raw, unedited, previously unreleased footage, the collection of 19 Betacam(!) tapes is being auctioned off by English appraisal and auction house Ted Owen & Co at the bargain base price of 750,000 pounds\u2014that\u2019s $1,030,517 U.S.\u2014though the house has estimated the value of these rare gems between 1.5 million and 3 million pounds. And just so you know how much Beyonc\u00e9 a million and change will get you, the auction\u2019s description is as follows:\n\nThe collection is now comprised of 19 videotapes (previously 11) that contain the footage from Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s first two professionally produced music video productions. These videos were never officially released and the footage in the collection used to create them is nearly three hours in length. Included are Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s rehearsals, performances and outtakes that were shot before, during and after an onstage performance with her group Girl\u2019s Tyme at the BMI New Music showcase at the DNA Lounge in San Francisco on Aug. 26, 1992. Also included are scenes shot at the Plant Recording Studios in Sausalito, Calif., during the time Beyonc\u00e9 was there to record her first professionally produced and engineered recordings. There is also footage from a third location\u2014a shopping mall\u2014where Beyonc\u00e9 is acting for the camera beside her longtime friend and Destiny\u2019s Child member / Grammy Award Winner LaTavia Roberson. In addition, the collection includes the edited master tapes and work-in-progress tapes from Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s first two music video productions. The collection has been locked in storage for more than 20 years and has only been seen by a select few people since being recorded.\n\nIf you\u2019re the Sultan of Brunei-level of Beyonc\u00e9 fan who feels they absolutely must have these pre-Auto-Tune performances in their life, our guess is that you can also afford to track down a Betacam player before the auction ends on March 13.

Did you know African-American women are 3 times as likely as other ethnic groups to experience bunions, hammer or overlapping toes and flat feet ? High heels, hard shoes and even sandals can cause or exacerbate all these symptoms and conditions, so as a woman\u2014with a size 10 foot\u2014who is passionate about shoes, I\u2019m always on the hunt for shoes that are good for my feet and look good too, especially with spring now just around the corner.\n\nWhenever possible, I make it a habit to buy my shoes a half-size up, and then add a premium-quality foam insole to make even a pair of heels feel like a pair of sneakers. Good insoles don\u2019t come cheap though; they can be priced anywhere from $15.00 to $50.00 for a top-of-the-line insole that fits into a dress shoe. The good thing is you only need one pair of insoles for dress shoes and one for sneakers. It\u2019s a small investment, but one that can payoff big, as it\u2019s a way to double to your shoe wardrobe: first by extending the life of your sneakers indefinitely and also by making the rest of your shoe wardrobe a lot more comfortable, so you\u2019ll wear them all more often.\n\nThe Insole Store is one of the absolute best sources to find an insole to comfort and soothe your particular foot type or condition with insoles tailored to fit everything from sneakers to stilettos. To identify the best corrective insert for your foot, call their customer service line to describe your specific needs, from where you feel pain in your feet to the residual pain it can cause in your back. Set aside a good twenty minutes for the call, because you\u2019ll probably only need to do it once, so you\u2019ll want to get it right.\n\nFor me, sandals are always where it gets tricky. You think you\u2019re doing yourself a favor by wearing flats, but when there\u2019s no cushioning or arch support, the tips of your toes and the may be on holiday, but the rest of your foot is working overtime. Your back\u2014not to mention your pedicure\u2014pay the price. The friction of feet sliding against flip flops and sandals when you walk causes calluses on the heels and balls and of the feet. Can you say pedicure killer?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnless you\u2019re walking on sand or grass for the majority of the day (I\u2019m about that life, even though I only live it on vacation), the impact of shoes without cushioning can be a stressor for the body. One my quick remedies for relieving tension in my feet is rolling a golf ball under the soles of my feet for a quick reflexology massage. I keep one in my desk, for quick and easy relief. Try it\u2014it does wonders, I promise.\n\nI\u2019m a sneaker-head for sure, so whenever I come across shoes that feel like sneakers, I\u2019m in on the protective style tip. As we move toward Spring, Nalho sandals are my new obsession. Inspired by traditional styles like Spanish espadrilles and Indian slides, these sandals feature lush cushy soles modeled after yoga mats, with memory foam padding and soft comfortable cotton uppers. Nahlo sandals are designed to support the arch of the foot, absorb impact on the heels and cushion the ball of the foot; taking care of the three major points that can lead to issues if left unprotected.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBottom line: I love a cute shoe that\u2019s protective, but not clunky. Sexy doesn\u2019t always have to mean stiletto\u2014although trust me, if I could get away with wearing stilettos 24/7 and a diet of champagne and French fries, I would. But until we get to that point in our evolutionary\u2014or devolutionary scale\u2014I\u2019ll be tackling the ups and downs of the shoe world by doing my best to balance protecting the health of my feet with my wicked desire for style.", "keywords": ["styles", "step", "shoes", "heels", "sandals", "youll", "feet", "best", "good", "protective", "insole", "foot", "forward", "shoe", "spring", "sneakers"], "polarity": 0.2637127338070735, "subjectivity": 0.549496515015383},

I say that because, often, clothes can be pretty but puzzling at the same time. Now, under the direction of designer Maria Grazia Chiuri, Dior speaks to women loud and clear. What\u2019s Grazia Chiuri got to say? For one, \u201cWe Should All Be Feminists\u201d\u2014the theme of her breakout collection for the house of Dior for Spring 2017.\n\nThe theme was taken from the essay of the same name written by the Nigerian writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, a brilliant manifesto on womanhood and citizenship that reads like the Wakandan Bill of Rights. Most people who wear the now ubiquitous T-shirt don\u2019t know its origin, but they\u2019ve gotten the message that the future is female.\n\nChimamanda Ngozi Adichie (Ted Talks)\n\nWhich brings us to Wednesday\u2019s Dior Fall/Winter 2018/2019 presentation in Paris, where Dior\u2019s women were still on the march. The collection was inspired by Paris\u2019 \u201cyouthquake\u201d in the summer of 1968, when students literally took to the streets, ripping cobblestones from the ground and hurling them at police, demanding better employment opportunities and reform of the university system. Being ever fashion-minded, young women protested long hemlines in front of the Dior boutique, brandishing signs reading, \u201cSupport the Mini Skirt.\u201d\n\nGrazia Chiuri, who is Italian and the former designer of Valentino, stumbled upon the photo while searching Dior\u2019s archives, as she recounted to London\u2019s Guardian newspaper:\n\nAnd then I discovered that [Marc] Bohan\u2019s response, [who designed Dior at the time], to this was to introduce the Miss Dior line, to give these younger consumers what they wanted. I thought it was so interesting to see fashion listening to women. And there is something about now that is similar to 1968. This is another moment when everything is changing.\n\nYes, we are again in a moment when everything is changing regarding women in the workplace and shaping the perception of our own beauty and our bodies. With the advent of social media\u2014which in this writer\u2019s opinion has done as much for black women\u2019s beauty as hip-hop has done for black men\u2019s voices\u2014we are in an era of unparalleled agency on our own behalf. Grazia Chiuri is listening, and poised to provide us the uniform.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDior Fall 2018 Paris Runway (Dominique Charriau/Getty/WireImage) Dior Fall \u201918 Paris Runway (Dominique Charriau/Getty/WireImage) Dior Fall \u201918 Paris Runway (Dominique Charriau Getty/WireImage) Dior Fall \u201918 Paris Runway (Dominique Charriau Getty/WireImage) 1 / 4\n\nThe clothes at Dior this week were a throwback to a time when flower power and femininity were one and the same. Long, easy dresses in bright floral prints, patchwork coats and rose-colored glasses to no doubt help us get through dark times sailed down the runway with a youthful ease. Mixed in were sweaters emblazoned with slogans like \u201cC\u2019est non, non et non\u201d (\u201cIt\u2019s no, no and no\u201d), in a nod to the new-age rules of sexual consent.\n\nAnother strong theme shown at Dior and trending across runways from New York, London, Milan and now Paris this season were relaxed boxy blazers worn over kilts and pleated skirts. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s so much that designers want women to be schoolgirls, but it\u2019s a way to show that women are teaching the world right now\u2014and changing the rules for the better.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarch on, ladies. On this first day of Women\u2019s History Month, we owe our mothers a debt and our daughters a future of freedom and dignity for womanhood across the globe.

But a few dresses went straight to the top of our shopping lists, including a backless, ruffled midi dress in a canyonlike hue ($98), a slubbed-cotton midi with a plunging neckline and tied sides ($108), and a seriously sexy ribbed-knit maxi gown with full sleeves ($98) that looks as comfortable as it is current.\n\nBut while dresses may be our summer go-to for easy, effortless fashion, Free People comes through with the separates, too. We\u2019re especially fond of its top-and-skirt sets, made for matching and paired as a blouson top and flippy miniskirt ($78), a button-fronted skirt and cropped blouse ($108), or a full and flowy skirt with a brief and boxy top ($128)\n\nIf you\u2019re just looking for a few pieces to update your already well-established summer wardrobe, consider a blousy top in an unexpected hue ($148) to pair with pants or jeans, incorporating details like embroidery into a breezy blouse ($128) or coupling the full-sleeved trend with smocks and stripes ($88) or a casual riff on the corset trend ($58) that was all over the 2018 runways.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd, yes, we know that the temps are currently barely above freezing throughout most of the U.S., but we also know spring is mere weeks away, and sundress season is therefore not far behind.\n\nSo whether shopping for a new seasonal capsule collection or shopping in your own closet, maybe the best advice is to channel a woman who clearly has excellent taste.

Neither did accomplished authors Sylvia Plath or Charlotte Bront\u00eb, or photographer Diane Arbus. They are among the women highlighted in a new series called \u2018Overlooked\u2019 that will publish obituaries for women who were not singled out for the honor at the time.\n\n\u201cThe first set of obituaries were rolled out March 8 \u2014 International Women\u2019s Day.

He got the gig after CBS\u2019 Chicago station WBBM demoted longtime anchor Harry Porterfield, removing an African American from the lineup of a station that had little diversity on its weekday newscasts. The Rev. Jesse Jackson and Operation PUSH led a 10-month boycott against WBBM, and Holt was moved from WCBS in New York to take over one of the nightly newscasts in Chicago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c \u2018I got that call and I was 27 years old,\u2019 Holt said. \u2018There was a tremendous amount of pressure.

Lula and her children (including my grandfather Bobby) are listed as being part Creek, but her husband, Noah, is not. Lula\u2019s death certificate and funeral records (date of death: Aug. 5, 1942), Wichita, Kan., Sedgwick County, list her mother as Precious Moore. The death certificate and funeral records for Lula list her mother\u2019s birthplace as Muskogee, Okla., and her own birthplace as Okmulgee, Okla., which were both once Creek Indian territory.\n\nCan you help find out if my great-grandmother was part Creek? \u2014Sheila Craig Western\n\nFamily lore about Native American ancestors is common in black families, but as Professor Gates has previously noted, citing research from Joanna Mountain and Kasia Bryc at 23andMe, the average African American is less than 1 percent Native American. Furthermore, if that DNA came from a single ancestor, he or she appeared as many as 10 generations (or roughly 300 years) ago. Many have no Native American ancestry at all.\n\nThe World in Which Your Great-Grandmother Lived\n\nHowever, there are exceptions involving the so-called Five Civilized Tribes\u2014the Creek (aka Muscogee), the Choctaw, the Cherokee, the Chickasaw and the Seminole\u2014who were removed by threat and force in the 1830s from the Southeast to Indian Territory, which included land in Kansas, the future Oklahoma and more. The dreadful Trail of Tears marches were a particularly brutal example of forced removal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe five Native nations were known as \u201ccivilized,\u201d in part because they owned black slaves. African Americans who descend from them or those they enslaved are more likely to have recent ancestry or affiliations from one of the nations. In his article \u201cHigh Cheekbones and Straight Black Hair?\u201d Professor Gates wrote:\n\n[Barbara] Krauthamer (author of \u2026 Black Slaves, Indian Masters: Slavery, Emancipation, and Citizenship in the Native American South), told me, while \u201cin the aggregate, most Native Americans and African Americans, free and enslaved, most likely had little contact over the 18th and 19th centuries,\u201d the major exception to this involved these five tribes. \u201cThere is an abundance of evidence,\u201d she said, \u201cthat documents \u2018family\u2019 and biological ties among African Americans and Native Americans in the Choctaw, Chickasaw, Cherokee, Creek and Seminole nations. The Choctaw, Chickasaw and Cherokees were slaveholding nations; so much that contact occurred in the context of slavery\u2014i.e., sexual abuse of enslaved women. \u201cIn the Creek nation, there is evidence of forced contact and childbearing but also of more consensual relationships, when Creeks incorporated runaway slave women from the southern states into their own communities and families.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis complex history led to some confusion as to exactly who was considered Indian when the time came to enumerate the five nations\u2019 membership. An 1890 federal census report on \u201cThe Five Civilized Tribes\u201d (pdf) explains:\n\nA serious difficulty was met in the answer to \u201cAre you an Indian?\u201d Under the laws of The Five Tribes or nations of the Indian territory a person, white in color and features, is frequently an Indian, being so by remote degree of blood or by adoption. \u2026 Negroes are frequently met who speak nothing but Indian languages, and are Indians by tribal law and custom, and others are met who call themselves Indians, who have not yet been acknowledged by the tribes.\n\nThis provides context for your great-grandmother\u2019s documented heritage. As you mentioned, Lula appears on the Indian-population census residing with her husband, Noah \u201cCreg,\u201d in Depew City, Creek County, Okla., in 1910. This record states that she was one-quarter Creek (with a question mark) and three-quarters black. The Native nations of her parents are both recorded as unknown. This record indicates that her marriage to Noah was her first marriage and that they had been married 11 years. She had borne nine children, with eight still living in 1910. She and her mother were born in Oklahoma, while her father was born in Mississippi.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe following page of the record indicates that while most children of Noah and Lula Creg/Craig were born in Oklahoma, the two eldest were born in Kansas around 1894 and 1896. The census record for the family in Iowa Township, Lincoln, Oklahoma Territory, in 1900 records Lula\u2019s birth in Texas and the fivebirths of the eldest five children in the household in Kansas. All of the records for Lula before Oklahoma becomes a state list her birthplace as Texas. Perhaps this is because she was actually born in Texas, or it could be their description of the location of her birth that was part of what was known as Indian Territory.\n\nIn 1895 Lula was 25 and living in Kansas with her husband, Noah Craig. Again, her birthplace is given as Texas, as is the birthplace of the eldest children in the household (who were likely from Noah Craig\u2019s previous marriage, based on their ages). These records give you several family members you could also research in several locales. You may also want to investigate Lula\u2019s parents and her siblings further to see if any of them were included on the Indian census or the Dawes Rolls, the latter of which recorded membership in the five nations between 1898 and 1906.\n\nMore Clues About Lula\u2019s Parents\n\nThe 1880 U.S. census includes Lula in the household of her father, Rankin Smith, in Mound Valley, Labette, Kan. The index records list the family as white, but if you view the original record, they are identified as \u201cM\u201d for mulatto. Her siblings included Charles Smith, born about 1868 in Texas. The 1885 Kansas state census (via Ancestry.com; subscription required) includes these children but not the mother, and Rankin is recorded as a widower, which suggests that Lula\u2019s mother died in Kansas between 1880 and 1885. The family was still residing in Labette County, and although Kansas death records in most counties don\u2019t begin until 1885, you may be able to locate a burial for her in Labette County that could help you connect her to more of her relatives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere may also be more to learn about Rankin Smith that may help you learn more about Lula\u2019s mother. There was a Rankin Smith recorded in the 1867 Texas Voter Registration Lists. This is a good fit for your Rankin Smith because he was born in Mississippi and living in Texas, where many records for Lula claim that she was born. This record is just three years prior to Lula\u2019s birth, and may suggest that she was born in Grimes County, Texas.\n\nThere are at least two marriage records for a Rankin Smith in Grimes County in the 1870s: one to Laura Johnson on April 6, 1871, and another to Precious Thompson on May 5, 1877. These are just indexes, but you could view digital copies of the originals at a Family History Library, or request copies from the county. It is possible that Precious Thompson is your Precious Moore and that perhaps she was married prior to her marriage to Rankin, with \u201cMoore\u201d being her maiden name and \u201cThompson\u201d a surname by a first marriage.\n\nInterestingly, when we searched for a Smith born about 1845 in Mississippi and living in Grimes County in 1870, we located a Clement Smith residing in Grimes County, who was born about 1844 in Mississippi, with a wife, Ida; a 2-year-old daughter named Ella; and a newborn named Ellen. If you examine the original record, just two doors away was a white man named James Rankin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe found this record interesting because there is a marriage record in the Texas County Marriage Index for a Clem Smith and Ida Moore on Jan. 13, 1867. The death record of your Lula claimed that her mother was Precious Moore. There are many coincidences between these records and your own family. You will likely want to investigate them further to see if you can establish a connection.\n\nAdditional Records Uncover Evidence of Indian Ancestry\n\nNow that you have a variety of known and suspected relatives to your Lula (Smith) Craig, there are record collections specific to American Indians that you could check to see if any of these people are included. You could begin by searching for the family members you identified in the 1910 federal Indian census. The Family History Library also holds census records specific to the Creek Nation. Note any coincidences or things that stand out as you research, even if you can\u2019t fully place them or prove a connection yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe noted some records that may be of interest. A Lulu Smith was recorded as a Creek in the \u201cArkansas Colored\u201d in 1895, along with Andy Smith, Mellie Smith, Winnie Smith and Rose Smith.\n\nLikewise, the Dawes Rolls index includes a Lula E. Smith roughly the right age who was a quarter Cherokee (remember, the 1910 census had a question mark next to \u201cCreek,\u201d opening up the possibility that her actual affiliation was with another Native nation). However, it is important to note that there are other Lula and Lucy Smiths listed. Once you have a card number, in this case Card No. 5885, check to see who else is listed on the card. We noted a Mary Thompson, which is a surname we recognized from one of Rankin Smith\u2019s marriage records.\n\nWhen working with the Dawes Rolls, do not just rely on a final-rolls search for known relatives in the Applications for Enrollment of the Commission to the Five Civilized Tribes, 1898-1914. If the family was rejected, the members would not be included on the final roll, but there may be a record of their application for recognition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinally, thank you for sending your DNA test results, but too little Native American ancestry was indicated for us to draw any conclusions about it.\n\nStill, you have a wealth of information here to research about your great-grandmother.

The latter was convened jointly by the American Society of News Editors, Associated Press Media Editors and Associated Press Photo Managers.\n\nMadhulika Sikka, newly named public editor at PBS, concluded her turn on an NPR ethics panel at ONA by saying, \u201cI care less about conversations about ideology, because conversations about race and gender are not being had. . . .

At an ASNE panel Monday titled \u201cHow the world sees US: Press freedom in Trump era,\u201d Mahfuz Anam, editor of the Daily Star in Bangladesh, urged more introspection by the American news media. John Yearwood, chair of the International Press Institute, and Marty Steffens, IPI board member and a professor at the University of Missouri School of Journalism, said press-freedom advocates plan to visit the interior of the United States, where authorities in a city such as St. Louis have been elevated internationally as threats to a free press.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnam also said that U.S. media support for the Iraq war under George W.

This is an immense responsibility; NCAI will approach this responsibility thoughtfully and deliberately with an eye towards strengthening Indian Country\u2019s voice.\u2019\n\n\u201cICTMN recently halted operations to evaluate its next steps in the face of unprecedented changes in the publishing industry, changes that have presented complicated challenges for every media organization across the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c \u2018ICTMN has been the flagship publication producing unique and original reporting about Indian Country \u2014 and the Oneida Indian Nation has played a pivotal role in forging that legacy,\u2019 said NCAI Executive Director Jacqueline Pata. \u2018After years of strong investments, we appreciate the Oneida Nation now turning over ICTMN\u2019s assets to our organization, and we look forward to convening meetings with key stakeholders over the next several months to construct a blueprint for how to best respectfully carry on ICTMN\u2019s mission.\u2019\n\n\u201cOver the past four decades the ICTMN has evolved from a local weekly print newsletter, to a national magazine, and now an online news syndicate reporting on the ground from \u2014 and for \u2014 Indian Country about the critical issues impacting Native nations and peoples in the United States and around the globe. . . .\u201d\n\nSupport Journal-isms Go Fund Me page.\n\nJoin the list of supporters.\n\nRichard Prince\u2019s Journal-isms originates from Washington.

It\u2019s still the most popular on Facebook and most emailed,\u201d she messaged.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Caroline Linton reported Thursday for CBS News, \u201cIda B. Wells, who was born a slave in 1862 and went on to become the most famous black woman of her time as a journalist and civil rights activist, never had an obituary in The New York Times. Neither did accomplished authors Sylvia Plath or Charlotte Bront\u00eb, or photographer Diane Arbus. They are among the women highlighted in a new series called \u2018Overlooked\u2019 that will publish obituaries for women who were not singled out for the honor at the time.\n\n\u201cThe first set of obituaries were rolled out March 8 \u2014 International Women\u2019s Day. New York Times national reporter Caitlin Dickerson, who wrote Wells\u2019 obituary, told CBSN\u2019s Elaine Quijano the paper is \u2018acknowledging now that the New York Times was, quite honestly, part of the problem.\u2019\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c \u2018The New York Times is the paper of record \u2014 it always, to a certain extent, reflected the culture of the moment,\u2019 Dickerson said. \u2018When we talk about Ida B. Wells, for example, born in the 1860s, we\u2019re talking about a moment when we, as a general culture, didn\u2019t pay attention to African Americans \u2014 especially African American women.\u2019\n\n\u201cDickerson said \u2018everybody in the building\u2019 was eager to be involved. \u2018I think this is going to be a rolling project,\u2019 Dickerson said.\n\n\u201cThe interest, Dickerson noted, reflects how important the issues of gender and inequality are even in a time of fast-breaking news. As Quijano pointed out, even in the last two years, only 20 percent of obituaries are written about women. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichael McCann, Sports Illustrated: Breaking Down Adrienne Lawrence\u2019s Lawsuit Against ESPN and the Company\u2019s Possible Defenses\n\nD.

RSF has established that from 2012 to 2017, the rights of at least 90 journalists in around 20 countries were seriously violated because they dared to cover or talk about women\u2019s rights or gender issues.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSeveral months of research has yielded the following chilling breakdown of these cases: 11 of these journalists were murdered, 12 were imprisoned, at least 25 were physically attacked, and at least 40 others were or are still being threatened on social networks.\n\n\u201cIn India, Gauri Lankesh, the editor of the secular and feminist weekly Gauri Lankesh Patrike, paid with her life for articles that criticized the woman\u2019s place in the caste system. She was gunned down on September 5, 2017. In Iran, many feminist journalists have been subjected to judicial harassment and imprisonment in connection with their writing.\n\n\u201cThey include Mansoureh Shojaee, who now lives in exile, and Narges Mohammadi, who is still detained. However, it is not just women journalists who are persecuted by the enemies of women\u2019s rights.

Only a quarter of Latino heads of household own their own homes in the state, compared to 69 percent of whites \u2014 the largest divide nationwide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBlack households in Massachusetts, by comparison, have a median income of $46,381, and 34 percent own homes.\n\n\u201cLanguage barriers and immigration status play a major role in the inequity \u2014 here and across the country \u2014 making it difficult for Latinos to progress beyond low-wage jobs or speak up about unfair treatment.\n\n\u201cBut there are added challenges in Massachusetts: a high cost of living and a majority of jobs that require college education, along with long waiting lists for English classes and a 15-year-old law \u2014 effectively overturned a few months ago \u2014 that eliminated bilingual education from most public schools. There are also relatively few Latino leaders and nonprofits, leading to low levels of civic engagement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPuerto Ricans, the largest group of Latinos in the state, struggle more than most, with fewer of them working or in school than among other Latino sub-populations.\n\n\u201cThen there\u2019s Boston\u2019s history of discrimination against black people, which dominates discussions about race.\n\n\u201c \u2018There\u2019s that feeling of, you\u2019re African-American or you\u2019re white, but there\u2019s no in-between,\u2019 said a Boston Police Department officer of Puerto Rican heritage who asked not to be identified. \u2018We\u2019re almost like the folks that nobody pays attention to.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAs a number of Latinos put it: They feel invisible here. . . .\u201d\n\nJohn Eggerton, Broadcasting & Cable: FCC to Help Fund Network Rebuilds in Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands\n\nLester Holt Didn\u2019t \u2018Want to Be Defined by My Color\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsked about being the first African American solo anchor of a weekday network nightly newscast, Lester Holt said he was honored and inspired by the impact of his career beyond the anchor desk, Chandelis R. Duster reported Feb. 28 for NBCBLK.\n\n\u201c \u2018Kids can now look around and see someone who looks like them on TV,\u2019 he said at New York\u2019s Paley Center for Media as \u201cNBC Nightly News\u201d celebrated 70 years.\n\n\u201cSaying he himself was inspired by journalists like Bernard Shaw, Bryant Gumbel, and others, Holt reflected on the impact of African-Americans in media. He also spoke of challenges he faced as a journalist of color.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c \u2018There were periods of my career where there was just pressure to define myself as a black journalist and I pushed back at that because I knew I wanted to succeed and not be defined by my color,\u2019 Holt said. \u2018I think if any of us are going to succeed, it\u2019s going to be on a broad scale.\u2019 . . .\u201d\n\nNevertheless, a major career break for Holt came as a result of pressure from African Americans pushing for diversity. He \u201clives by the words a mentor once said to him early in his career: Prepare yourself to walk through doors of opportunity that will swing open when you least expect them to,\u201d Stephen Battaglio wrote in 2015 for the Los Angeles Times.\n\n\u201cIt first happened to Holt in 1986, when he landed a major local TV anchor job. He got the gig after CBS\u2019 Chicago station WBBM demoted longtime anchor Harry Porterfield, removing an African American from the lineup of a station that had little diversity on its weekday newscasts. The Rev. Jesse Jackson and Operation PUSH led a 10-month boycott against WBBM, and Holt was moved from WCBS in New York to take over one of the nightly newscasts in Chicago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c \u2018I got that call and I was 27 years old,\u2019 Holt said. \u2018There was a tremendous amount of pressure.

Cristina L\u00f3pez G. wrote Friday for Media Matters for America, \u201cRight-wing and fringe media attacked NBC anchor Lester Holt . . .\n\n\u201cThey claimed Holt was \u2018disrespectful\u2019 and a \u2018rude Negro\u2019 who \u2018interrupted\u2019 and \u2018spoke over\u2019 Trump, calling the interview \u2018an interrogation\u2019 during which the president was treated \u2018like a damn criminal.\u2019 . . .\u201d\n\nThe \u201crude Negro\u201d reference, one of few mentioning Holt\u2019s race, came from infostormer.com, whose motto is \u201cDestroying Jewish Tyranny.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe website was correct to take the interview seriously, however. In its wake were questions about obstruction of justice, reports that Trump had sought a loyalty oath from Comey and even speculation about impeachment.\n\nAs Grove reported, \u201cThe biggest headline from the White House t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate \u2014 blazoned in an exclusive video clip that was judiciously released by NBC in a special report that preempted an afternoon soap opera (as opposed to the ongoing Trump soap opera) \u2014 was the president\u2019s claim to have decided on his own to fire Comey after hosting him at a White House dinner (in which Comey, according to Trump, asked to keep his job).\n\n\u201cThe president said that he repeatedly, if improperly, sought the director\u2019s reassurance that he isn\u2019t the target of the FBI\u2019s investigation into Russia\u2019s meddling in last year\u2019s election and the Kremlin\u2019s possible collusion with Trump campaign operatives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThose revelations provoked bipartisan expressions of outrage and amply demonstrated what many in Washington and beyond have suspected: that Trump\u2019s hapless communications team \u2014 notably Sean Spicer, Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Kellyanne Conway, to say nothing of Vice President Mike Pence \u2014 have either been incompetently out of the loop or lying their asses off when they\u2019ve insisted for the past three days that Comey was fired only because of a face to face meeting followed by a meticulous review and thoughtful recommendation from the freshly minted deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, and his boss, Attorney General Jeff Sessions. . . .\u201d\n\nJim Rutenberg of the New York Times captured the reaction of many.\n\n\u201cThat the White House couldn\u2019t get its story (or stories) straight about something as important as the firing of the F.B.I. director, during an investigation into ties between the president\u2019s campaign and a foreign power reportedly trying to sway a United States presidential election, once again breaks the mold of what\u2019s \u2018normal\u2019 in United States governance,\u201d Rutenberg wrote Friday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn social media, some criticized Holt for failure to follow up on some questions, but others noted that the anchor had to be strategic in the use of his time.\n\nGrove wrote, \u201cThe anchor directed the president to a straight-back chair opposite his own. While Holt leaned back and crossed his legs in an attitude of alpha male sangfroid throughout their 31-minute encounter . . . Trump sat edgily forward on his chair, legs spread wide \u2014 looking for all the world like some giant, yellow-haired badger bracing for an attack.\n\n\u201cIn a way, Trump was right to do so, as Holt relentlessly pressed him for a reason for sacking Comey that made even a little bit of sense, wondering repeatedly if the president was angry at the FBI director, as multiple news outlets have reported, because his agency was pursuing what he\u2019d called the \u2018hoax\u2019 of the Russia investigation. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConservative media watchers, such as Tim Graham of NewsBusters, tried to paint Holt, reported to be a registered Republican, as pro-Hillary Clinton.\n\n\u201cHolt was the designated hit man in Thursday\u2019s interview, expected to create and underline a \u2018credibility crisis\u2019 for the White House,\u201d Graham wrote Friday. \u201cBut don\u2019t they remember how Holt \u2018winced\u2019 to Hillary Clinton in January of 2016 at anyone [who] suggested she might be seen by someone as (gasp) dishonest...why that must hurt her feelings! . . .\u201d\n\nThe interview did not touch on race-specific concerns such as historically black colleges and universities or immigration, but Trump did discuss Clinton\u2019s emails, North Korea and health care.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPresident Donald Trump told Jeanine Pirro that he thinks it is a \u2018good idea\u2019 to not have press conferences, unless he does them himself every two weeks,\u201d Ted Johnson reported Friday for Variety.\u201dTwo days after firing FBI director James Comey and creating a full-blown constitutional crisis, Donald Trump signed an executive order today creating a presidential commission on \u2018election integrity,\u2019 based on his debunked claims that millions voted illegally in 2016,\u201d Ari Berman wrote Thursday for the Nation.\n\nTrump Suggests Ending Daily Briefings\n\n\n\n\u201cPresident Donald Trump told Jeanine Pirro that he thinks it is a \u2018good idea\u2019 to not have press conferences, unless he does them himself every two weeks,\u201d Ted Johnson reported Friday for Variety.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHis comments came after he tweeted early Friday morning that perhaps the White House should do away with the daily press briefings, a long-time tradition in which the press secretary faces the gamut of reporters every day.\n\n\u201cTrump was frustrated over media reports that what he has said about the reasons for firing FBI Director James Comey contradicts what his communications staff said earlier in the week. . . .\u201d\n\nTrump Voting Panel to Push \u2018Myth of Fraud\u2019\n\n\n\n\u201cTwo days after firing FBI director James Comey and creating a full-blown constitutional crisis, Donald Trump signed an executive order today creating a presidential commission on \u2018election integrity,\u2019 based on his debunked claims that millions voted illegally in 2016,\u201d Ari Berman wrote Thursday for the Nation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cVice President Mike Pence will be the chair and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach will be the vice chair \u2014 two men with very long histories of making it harder to vote, especially Kobach. Given the lack of evidence of voter fraud, the commission seems designed for one purpose: to perpetuate the myth of fraud in order to lay the groundwork for enacting policies that suppress the vote.\n\n\u201cIf you want to know what such voter intimidation looks like, take a look at Pence\u2019s home state of Indiana, where state police in October 2016 raided the offices of a group working to register African-American and low-income voters. They seized thousands of voter-registration applications, even though only 10 were suspected to be fraudulent and no one has been charged.\n\n\u201cIn Kansas, Kobach has been the driving force within the GOP behind policies that erect new barriers to the ballot box and the most fervent evangelist of unproven voter-fraud claims. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Kansas City Star said in an editorial on Thursday, \u201cSince the non-problem of in-person voter fraud \u2014 Kobach has convicted all of nine Kansans of this crime \u2014 is inflated to push through laws that disenfranchise, this whole commission isn\u2019t just unnecessary but wrong. . . .\u201d\n\nOn Friday, the NAACP said in a statement, \u201cThis Commission poses a very real and direct threat to our electoral system and democracy.

In a recent analysis by the CDC Foundation, nearly 60 percent of such deaths were preventable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhile maternal mortality is significantly more common among African Americans, low-income women and in rural areas, pregnancy and childbirth complications kill women of every race and ethnicity, education and income level, in every part of the U.S. ProPublica and NPR spent the last several months scouring social media and other sources, ultimately identifying more than 450 expectant and new mothers who have died since 2011. . . .\u201d\n\nMartin and Montagne also wrote, \u201cIn recent decades, under the assumption that it had conquered maternal mortality, the American medical system has focused more on fetal and infant safety and survival than on the mother\u2019s health and well-being. . . .\u201d\n\nNABJ Names Four More Award Winners\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe National Association of Black Journalists announced awards this week for Leoneda Inge, Ernest Owens, Candace Smith and Jocelyn K.

Some of the biggest differentiators include:\n\n\u201cThe Voice. CASSIUS is \u2018born unapologetic.\u2019 Imbued with the spirit of young Cassius Clay, the brand aspires to represent Black culture on a global stage in a very unapologetic manner.\n\n\u201cThe Strategy. CASSIUS pulls from the best of magazine culture and injects it into the digital space.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo while we will cover the day to day stuff such as Kendrick [Lamar] dropped an album and Beyonce is having twins, we will also be planning around big monthly themes that drive a specific cultural conversation.\n\n\u201cThis will be done in the form of Monthly Digital Covers that start the conversation and multimodal content (text, photo and video) that [complements] the covers. To do this, we\u2019ve bought together a great team of millennial editors with print and digital experience.\n\n\u201cThe .com Experience. We believe that the visual web is what drives the internet; consequently, the CASSIUS.com experience was built to be visually engaging and different from any other .com experience. You will see this in the content which will be video first, our \u2018moodboard,\u2019 which is the way our audience will navigate the site from the homepage, the custom graphics that compliment every article and the custom style section that is being built.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe Team. The CASSIUS editorial team is uniquely diverse and a wholistic slice of New America: Black, LatinX, white. Gen X and Millennial. Straight and LGBTQ. Male and female.\n\n\u201cAsked about the business model, Samuels replied: \u201cCASSIUS is an ultra premium environment. We built it based on how we see the future of publishing sites, which is heavy on content and light on ads. The only places we have to run media on CASSIUS are pre-roll video and one large banner on every article page.\n\n\u201cConsequently, the bulk of the revenue will have to come from native advertising and sponsorships, which is what we believe is the future for all publishers who want to build differentiated platform for advertisers.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nParties Disagree on Role of News Media\n\n\u201cDemocrats and Republicans, who already tend to place their trust in different news sources and rely on different outlets for political news, now disagree more than ever on a fundamental issue of the news media\u2019s role in society: whether news organizations\u2019 criticism of political leaders primarily keeps them from doing things they shouldn\u2019t \u2014 or keeps them from doing their job,\u201d Michael Barthel and Amy Mitchell reported Wednesday for the Pew Research Center.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cToday, in the early days of the Trump administration, roughly nine-in-ten Democrats (89%) say news media criticism keeps leaders in line (sometimes called the news media\u2019s \u2018watchdog role\u2019), while only about four-in-ten Republicans (42%) say the same. . . .\u201d\n\nThe study did not include breakouts by race, Pew communications manager Rachel Weisel said.\n\nJoseph Lichterman, Nieman Lab: Study: More Americans than ever are getting their news on mobile, but there are huge partisan divides over the media\u2019s proper role\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPuerto Rico, Colonial Relationship Both Bankrupt\n\n\u201cLast week Puerto Rico officially became the largest bankruptcy case in the history of the American public bond market,\u201d Juan Gonz\u00e1lez reported Tuesday for the Intercept.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOn May 3, a fiscal control board imposed on the island\u2019s government by Washington less than year ago suddenly announced that the Puerto Rico\u2019s economic crisis \u2018has reached a breaking point.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe board asked for the immediate appointment of a federal judge to decide how to deal with a staggering $123 billion debt the commonwealth government and its public corporations owe to both bondholders and public employee pension systems.\n\n\u201cThe announcement sparked renewed press attention to a Caribbean territory that many have dubbed America\u2019s Greece.

Neither did accomplished authors Sylvia Plath or Charlotte Bront\u00eb, or photographer Diane Arbus.

Media people have acknowledged to pollsters that they are so focused on the present that they don\u2019t pay close attention to what might be in store for them in five, 10 or 20 years.\n\nLater in her talk Wednesday before the Knight Media Forum in Miami, Webb told people of color that they weren\u2019t thought about when the creators of self-driving cars, GPS navigators, robotics and other such technologies were being developed.\n\n\u201cMy question is, what does all this mean for communities of color?\u201d (video) asked Sara Lomax-Reese, president and CEO of black talk-formatted WURD radio in Philadelphia.

Hire more, create a situation . . . where a person of color can become an executive. Anybody know off the top of their head how many female editors-in-chief of newspapers we currently have? No. Any idea of how many male . . . how many black . . . or Asian or Hispanic editors in chief? . . .\n\n\u201cWe can turn on the diversity tap, we just have to decide that we want to do that, and create the mechanisms for people to actually move up the ladder.

These new data systems have tremendous potential to empower communities of color. Tools like statistical modeling, data visualization, and crowd-sourcing, in the right hands, are powerful instruments for fighting bias, building progressive movements, and promoting civic engagement.\n\n\u201cBut history tells a different story, one in which data is too often wielded as an instrument of oppression, reinforcing inequality and perpetuating injustice. Redlining was a data-driven enterprise that resulted in the systematic exclusion of Black communities from key financial services. More recent trends like predictive policing, risk-based sentencing, and predatory lending are troubling variations on the same theme. Today, discrimination is a high-tech enterprise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cData for Black Lives seeks to mobilize scientists around racial justice issues. . . .\u201d\n\nPhoto: Angel Valentin/Knight Foundation\n\nAttention to Diversity: One Remedy for Lack of Trust\n\nIn the United States alone, foundations spent $140 million to support journalism in 2015, according to Media Impact Funders, a Philadelphia-based organization that tracks such things.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGlobally, the figure was $153.5 million. The providers of those funds are increasingly worried that the institutions they are supporting aren\u2019t trusted.\n\nCould more attention to diversity help close that gap? Some at this week\u2019s Knight Media Forum were saying yes.\n\nAlberto Ibarguen, president of the Knight Foundation, said Tuesday in his opening remarks, \u201cAs local and regional news has weakened, trust has declined.

No. 4 on Waters\u2019 list was \u201cDemand More Diversity.\u201d\n\nMartina Guzman, a Detroit-based freelancer, urged more support for freelancers who want to cover their communities in ways that newsroom staffers are not permitted. The $200 that a public radio network might pay for a long-form piece isn\u2019t sufficient. \u201cJournalists of color feel so isolated,\u201d she said at another point.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCollaborations of all kinds \u2014 with other news organizations and with community groups \u2014 were encouraged. One of the most prominent was launched in the San Francisco Bay Area last summer. News organizations collectively tackled the housing crisis.\n\n\u201cThe Bay Area Media Collaborative will strive to stimulate more intensive and ongoing collaboration among news organizations, most of which are hamstrung by small news staffs and reporting budgets,\u201d Jon Funabiki, executive director of Renaissance Journalism, wrote in August. \u201cIn that sense, BAMC will more closely resemble an earlier Renaissance Journalism initiative called the Detroit Journalism Cooperative (DJC), which brought together nine news outlets. As in our other initiatives, the DJC news partners produced award-winning stories about Detroit\u2019s financial crisis, segregation, policing, the schools and other important issues.

Journal apologized Thursday after being widely criticized for running a cartoon equating the young, undocumented immigrants known as \u201cDreamers\u201d with members of the criminal Latino gang MS-13.\n\n\u201cIt was a mistake,\u201d Karen Moses told Journal-isms by telephone on Friday. \u201cGoing forward, there definitely will be\u201d closer scrutiny of the cartoons selected for the newspaper.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t talk about how we make our decisions,\u201d Moses said, declining to disclose who made the decision to green-light the offending cartoon. However, Moses added that as the editor of the newspaper, with jurisdiction over its editorial pages, she takes responsibility.\n\nSimon Romero reported for the New York Times that the cartoon was \u201cprompting outrage from prominent Democrats and Republicans in the state.\u201d The illustration, by Sean Delonas, \u201cdepicts a white couple being accosted in a back alley by three men. One is holding the couple at gunpoint and taking the woman\u2019s purse. Another is wearing a jacket emblazoned with \u2018MS-13,\u2019 the name of a gang that President Trump and others have repeatedly invoked to denounce illegal immigration. The third has on a ski mask and a suicide vest of smoking explosives.\n\n\u201cThe male victim tells the woman, \u2018Now, honey ... I believe they prefer to be called \u201cDreamers,\u201d \u2018 a reference to young undocumented immigrants predominantly from Latin America, and adds, \u2018Or future Democrats.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe cartoon, which was published on Wednesday, quickly elicited criticism around New Mexico, where about 48.5 percent of the population is Hispanic, the highest percentage of any state in the country. Tensions have simmered in the state, which Mr. Trump lost in the 2016 election, over the federal government\u2019s immigration policies. . . . \u201c\n\nRomero also noted Moses\u2019 written apology, in which she said \u201cthat the cartoon \u2018appeared to us to be poking at President Trump\u2019s rhetoric by portraying a quaking Republican couple who were painting Dreamers with a broad, totally false, brush.\u2019\n\n\u201cBut Mr. Delonas, the cartoonist, said that while he sympathized with Ms. Moses, he disagreed with her assessment of the illustration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c \u2018That\u2019s not the way I read it,\u2019 said Mr. Delonas, 56, a former cartoonist at The New York Post. \u2018I\u2019ve learned that MS-13 is purposely sending minors over here to commit crimes. I\u2019m pretty sure that the cartels are using minors for a lot of their drug dealing.\u2019 . . .\u201d\n\nMoses told Journal-isms that she was not aware of previous controversies involving Delonas\u2019 cartoons, but \u201cI am now.\u201d\n\nAfter 23 years at the paper, Delonas took a buyout from the New York Post in 2013, during the Barack Obama administration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDuring a long career at the Post, Mr. Delonas was definitely un-PC,\u201d Kara Bloomgarden-Smoke wrote then for the New York Observer. \u201cHis cartoons for the tabloid at times attracted controversy \u2014 like his 2009 cartoon of a [cop] shooting a monkey, while [another cop quips] that they will need to find someone else to write the stimulus bill (prompting cries of racism since Mr. Delonas seemed to be equating a chimp with the president). . . .\u201d\n\nIn a rare move, the Post responded to the outcry by apologizing \u201cto those who were offended by the image.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, after the Associated Press reported on the New York Police Department\u2019s clandestine spying on Muslim communities, for which the AP won a Pulitzer Prize, Delonas depicted three Muslims making bombs in an apartment. Looking out the window at the police, one says, \u201cHello, AP Press? I\u2019d like to register a complaint against the N.Y.P.D. for spying on us.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Thursday, May Ortega, president of the New Mexico chapter of the National Association of Hispanic Journalists, wrote that she was dissatisfied with Moses\u2019 printed apology. \u201cThrough publishing this image, you have failed your community and your staff \u2014 some of whom we represent. We demand a proper apology for publishing this racist image and a retraction of it. And we ask that you implement a better internal system to avoid these kinds of regrettable actions.\u201d\n\nNationally, NAHJ issued a statement Friday saying, \u201cThis morning, NAHJ is able to report a meeting that occurred over the phone with Karen Moses, Editor-in-Chief of the Albuquerque Journal. This critical and sincere conversation included the EIC taking responsibility for the grave error, identified the issue allowing this to happen and laying out the preventative measures the Journal will be putting in place moving forward. . . .\u201d\n\nHowever, Moses told Journal-isms that the telephone call lasted 30 seconds \u2014 \u201cmaybe two minutes\u201d \u2014 and that she did not specify what preventative measures would be taken.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Journal did not participate in the 2017 newsroom diversity survey of the American Society of News Editors.

Their story was produced in collaboration with Univision Chicago, and made available in English and Spanish.\n\n\u201cIn 2017, the police department hired whites and Latinos at rates more than double that of African-Americans, who made up just 17 percent of the total 1,126 new hires,\u201d Stark and Litttle continued. For Univision, the angle for the story, written by Adriana Cardona Maguigad, was, \u201cMore Hispanics make it through the CPD hiring process but African Americans are falling behind.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStark and Little wrote, \u201cIt\u2019s not that blacks shy away from seeking police jobs. A Chicago Reporter examination of police hiring data going back to 2013 \u2014 the most complete recruitment records available \u2014 shows that many African-Americans have applied to the force in recent years. They just haven\u2019t been hired, hurting efforts to further diversify the department as it struggles to improve its relationship with black communities.\n\n\u201cOf more than 8,000 black applicants, nearly 30 percent didn\u2019t show up for the written entrance exam, the first step in the recruitment process, while 17 percent failed the test, according to data analyzed by the Reporter. Many applicants who passed the test later dropped out of the process, which includes an extensive background check and physical, psychological and drug tests.\n\n\u201cIn some policing circles, the prevailing sentiment has been that few African-Americans were interested in joining the force. But the five-year data indicate a different story: When it comes to cultivating black candidates, the issue may be retention, not recruitment, in a multistep process that can take years. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow a Police Department Institutionalizes Racism\n\nFrom 2013 to 2017, members of the Columbus, Ohio, Division of Police \u201cfatally shot 28 people, according to Mapping Police Violence. Twenty-one of them were black . . ., \u201c Alli Maloney reported Wednesday for Pacific Standard.\n\n\u201cEvery time a Columbus police officer kills a citizen, two sides to the story exist. But aggressive behavior by officers often goes unchecked by the department \u2014 which is backed by a powerful police union \u2014 and decades of non-indictments from the prosecutor\u2019s office for those who kill shows how, in Ohio\u2019s [capital], the victim\u2019s families are often silenced and officers\u2019 perspective becomes the main narrative.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe CPD has operated this way for decades \u2014 a narrative not dissimilar to other police departments across the country. But how does that sort of aggression, that deep-seated racism, become institutionalized into an organization?

Donald Trump\u2019s Tumultuous First Year in Office\n\nDonald Trump made it his business to dominate the news cycle as much as possible in 2017, and there is no sign of a change in strategy for 2018.\n\nHis comments on race and religion led journalists of color to confront his press representatives at briefings and to question whether to flat-out call the president a white supremacist. In one of many outrageous examples, from May, then-Press Secretary Sean Spicer demonized Hispanic immigrant teens accused of rape, using the accusation as justification for the president\u2019s campaign against immigrants who are in the country illegally.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt turned out that the charges against the teens were dropped. The defense maintained all along that the sex was consensual. The White House was questioned sharply and justifiably about its rush to judgment. CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta was often front and center.\n\nThere was the feud between April Ryan, Washington correspondent for American Urban Radio Networks, and Omarosa Manigault Newman, who, after rumors that her time was limited, was ousted in December as a White House adviser, effective in 2018. Omarosa\u2019s appearance at the National Association of Black Journalists convention in August proved to be a \u201chot mess\u201d as she clashed with panel moderator Ed Gordon.\n\nRyan was not invited to the White House Christmas Party for the first time in 20 years. \u201cI don\u2019t think I was overlooked,\u201d Ryan told the Washington Post. \u201cI think they don\u2019t like me. For whatever reason, they have disdain for me.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome news organizations, among them the Post and the New York Times, produced a dizzying series of scoops in May about Trump and his associates\u2019 ties to Russia. But black and brown reporters were not on the teams unearthing them.\n\nDean Baquet, executive editor of the Times, attributed the low representation to an industry-wide problem.\n\n\u201cThere are not enough investigative reporters who happen to be African American or Latino,\u201d Baquet said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump\u2019s demonization of the news media \u2014 calling members \u201cenemies of the people\u201d \u2014 had worldwide consequences. His insistence on dominating news cycles was not only crowding out other news, but emboldening autocrats elsewhere. The Trump administration was delivering a message, said Joel Simon of the Committee to Protect Journalists, that \u201cJournalists are contemptible, and governments that crack down on the media face no consequences in terms of their relationship with the US. . . .\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s appeals to white nationalists gave a boost to best-selling author Ta-Nehisi Coates of the Atlantic, whose public profile rose higher with publication of \u201cThe First White President,\u201d an article excerpted from his book about the Obama era, \u201cWe Were Eight Years in Power.\u201d\n\nNews media efforts to report more on Trump supporters met with pushback from some journalists of color, who argued that news involving voters of color was being sacrificed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe spend an inordinate amount of time looking at angry white voters,\u201d Nikole Hannah-Jones, a writer for the New York Times Magazine who specializes in racial issues, said at the Online News Association convention in October. \u201cThis is the first election after the [weakening of the] Voting Rights Act and voter suppression. Lots of votes were probably suppressed.\u201d\n\nA study from the battleground state of Wisconsin \u201cestimates 16,800 or more people in Dane and Milwaukee counties were deterred from casting ballots in November because of Wisconsin\u2019s voter ID law,\u201d Patrick Marley and Jason Stein reported Sept. 26 for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. The study found the ID law disproportionately affected African Americans and low-income people.\n\nIn the aftermath of Democrat Doug Jones\u2019 upset victory over Republican Roy Moore in Alabama\u2019s special December election for the U.S. Senate seat vacated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, African American voters \u2014 especially African American women \u2014 were credited with saving the day for Jones. Many were surprised.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSheila Tyson, a member of the Birmingham City Council who is Alabama convener of the nonpartisan National Coalition on Black Civic Participation, told Journal-isms, \u201cno one covered us and what we were doing.\u201d\n\n2. Sexual Harassment Charges Bring Down Powerful\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe \u201csilence breakers\u201d \u2014 women and men who came forward with accusations of sexual harassment \u2014 were Time magazine\u2019s \u201cPerson of the Year,\u201d and it was appropriate that Tarana Burke, a black woman, was among them. A social activist, Burke first used the hashtag #MeToo more than a decade ago as part of her work building solidarity among young survivors of harassment and assault.\n\n\n\nAs with the Trump investigations, black and brown journalists were not prominent among the reporters uncovering misdeeds, but were among the accusers and the accused.\n\nThe accused included talk-show host Tavis Smiley; Stephen Henderson, editorial page editor of the Detroit Free Press; BuzzFeed White House correspondent Adrian Carrasquillo; longtime Fox Business anchor Charles Payne; and Francisco Cort\u00e9s, vice president of Fox News for the English-language Fox News Latino website, now stripped of original content. In the Cort\u00e9s case, 21st Century Fox reached an agreement with Fox worth more than $2.5 million in late February, Emily Steel reported for the New York Times in March.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost of these men denied the charges or said they were overblown. A rape charge against Payne is in court. Writing in New York magazine on Dec. 1, Suki Kim disclosed problems that John Hockenberry, host of New York Public Radio\u2019s \u201cThe Takeaway,\u201d who is white, had with black female co-hosts on a show designed to spotlight diversity.\n\nSeparately, veteran Chicago rock critic Jim DeRogatis reported for months on a stunning story about R&B singer R. Kelly and young women said to be under his psychological and sexual control, held as if in a cult. \u201cThree separate media organizations were interested but got cold feet at the last minute, DeRogatis said,\u201d according to Margaret Sullivan of the Washington Post.\n\nFinally, Gawker published it. Kelly has insisted that there\u2019s no truth that he runs a cult or anything like it, Sullivan said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWriting in October for splinternews.com, Michael Arceneaux asked, \u201cWhat will it take to get more of us to give a damn about R. Kelly\u2019s alleged crimes?\n\nThe answer may lie in who his victims are. \u201cThe difference between Kelly and other powerful men like [Hollywood mogul Harvey] Weinstein and [the late Fox News founder Roger] Ailes is that Kelly\u2019s accusers are primarily black girls and women. Black girls and women who are young or underage. Black girls and women who are poor or working class. . . .\u201d\n\nIn October, four female journalists, including former Detroit Free Press photographer Regina Boone, filed a federal lawsuit against the Free Press and its parent company, Gannett, alleging pay discrimination.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n3. \u2018Suspension\u2019 of Roland Martin\u2019s \u2018NewsOne Now\u2019\n\nAfter four years, the black-owned TV One cable network pulled \u201cNewsOne Now With Roland Martin,\u201d the only black-oriented daily television news program, saying in a December announcement that it is \u201cworking to restructure NewsOne Now in 2018 under a new format that will better serve its audience and advertisers.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe decision baffled many, especially since the program was expanded from one hour to two in the year\u2019s third quarter. TV One had proclaimed that the show had experienced \u201csix consecutive quarters of growth.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe staff wrap party for the last episode of NewsOne Now with Roland Martin was not supposed to feel like it did,\u201d Jason Johnson wrote for The Root.\n\n\u201cI walked into the staff kitchen and saw Martin in all of his fuchsia glory, smiling, ascot crisp, happily chopping it up. \u2018What\u2019s up, baby?\u2019 he said, then hit me with a hug like we were at Essence Fest or the Republican convention, not the last day of an award-winning TV show. . . . The more people I talked to, the more obvious it\u2019s became that nobody knew for sure why NewsOne Now was going off the air, but the one thing on which they did agree was that black folks were going to be the worse for it. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. FCC Aligns Itself With Big Media\n\nIn \u201can awful new low\u201d that elicited warnings about \u201ca new wave of media consolidation,\u201d the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rolled back media ownership regulations under the guise of trying \u201cto modernize its broadcast ownership rules & to help promote ownership diversity,\u201d Jessica Corbett wrote Nov. 16 for Common Dreams.\n\n\u201c \u2018Any pretense that this vote will help journalism or increase ownership diversity is cynical and offensive,\u2019 said Free Press president and CEO Craig Aaron, warning that the move will \u2018lead to more mergers, more layoffs, and more communities that have no news outlets in place to cover important stories and hold officials accountable.\u2019 . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe approved order:\n\n\u201cEliminates newspaper/broadcast and radio/television cross-ownership rules, which imposed restrictions on owning multiple media outlets in the same market;\n\n\u201cRelaxes rules about local television ownership \u2014 including joint sales agreements, which allow a company to control news operations at several stations in one market, where stations would typically compete against each other; and [formally] requests \u2018comment on how to design and implement\u2019 an FCC diversity incubator program. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe order comes as local news becomes more precious. \u201cAs local newspapers have closed across the country, more and more communities are left with no daily local news outlet at all,\u201d Yemile Bucay, Vittoria Elliott, Jennie Kamin and Andrea Park wrote for the spring 2017 issue of Columbia Journalism Review.\n\nIn December, the FCC scrapped so-called \u201cnet neutrality\u201d regulations that prohibited broadband providers from blocking websites or charging for higher-quality service or certain content.\n\nStanding with other progressive organizations, the NAACP said it \u201cis staunchly opposed to any attempt to censor or manipulate information on the internet, especially if it creates a barrier to entry for people of color.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJournalists of color associations have long opposed media consolidation. In 2014, the National Association of Black Journalists and the National Association of Hispanic Journalists joined others in a letter opposing joint sales agreements, saying, \u201cThese arrangements have harmed communities of color by leading to the elimination of local newscasts and employment opportunities for journalists of color. Furthermore, they have reduced the opportunities for people of color to own broadcast stations. . . . \u201c\n\nProponents say the arrangements actually save jobs by allowing for financially healthier broadcast companies. Armstrong Williams, the conservative commentator who has benefited from such agreements as owner of Howard Stirk Holdings, wrote in Broadcasting & Cable in December, \u201cbroadcast ownership has permitted Howard Stirk Holdings to create an incubator for African American journalism students by providing tuition scholarships, while providing field experience outside of the classroom.

The Numbers\n\nThe news industry enters 2018 approaching the 50th anniversary March 1 of the Kerner Commission report, officially the report of the presidentially appointed National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders.\n\nThe examination of the causes of the 1967 urban uprisings said that \u201cfewer than 5 percent of the people employed by the news business in the United States today are Negroes\u201d and that \u201cthe journalistic profession has been shockingly backward in seeking out, hiring, training and promoting Negroes.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2017, the American Society of News Editors\u2019 annual diversity survey of newspapers and online outlets (but not broadcasters) found that journalists of color comprised 16.6 percent of the workforce in responding U.S. newsrooms.\n\nIn local television news, the workforce rose to 24.4 percent people of color, Bob Papper reported in his annual survey for the Radio Television Digital News Association and Hofstra University.\n\n\u201cStill, as far as minorities are concerned, the bigger picture remains unchanged,\u201d Papper wrote. \u201cIn the last 27 years, the minority population in the U.S. has risen 12.1 points; but the minority workforce in TV news is up just over half that at 6.6. And the minority workforce in radio is less than 1 point higher. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMizell Stewart III, then president of the American Society of News Editors, wrote members in May, \u201cThe lack of progress is palpable because the continuing transformation of media business models has led to dramatic reductions in newsroom employment, particularly at local newspapers.\n\n\u201cIn many legacy news organizations, moving the needle on staff diversity took a back seat to the survival of the enterprise. . . .\u201d ASNE is emphasizing diversity at the leadership level with its \u201cEmerging Leaders Institutes.\u201d\n\nStill, there were initiatives as well as setbacks.\n\nNew America Media, which described itself as \u201cthe nation\u2019s first and largest collaboration of and advocate for ethnic, community, minority, and bilingual media sources,\u201d closed Nov. 30 after 45 years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, the City University of New York Graduate School of Journalism said it hopes to fill the gap.\n\nThe Gizmodo Media Group announced that 50 percent of its workforce is of color, and the Association of Alternative Newsmedia, representing the overwhelmingly white alternative press, said it would conduct a demographic survey of newspaper staff. However, African American columnists Barry Saunders of the News & Observer in Raleigh, N.C., and Shaun King of the Daily News in New York, parted company with their employers. (King is now with the Intercept.)\n\nA study from the National Association of Hispanic Journalists excoriated coverage of Latinos on the evening news shows, but the hurricane disaster in Puerto Rico put Latino journalists front and center.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication added a new professional program called Cronkite Noticias, a newscast featuring six bilingual journalists who write and broadcast for the Spanish-speaking community in Arizona,\u201d as Alexa Buechler wrote in February for the State Press, the student newspaper at Arizona State University..\n\nWilliam C. Rhoden, former New York Times sports columnist, joined The Undefeated, which began the \u201cRhoden Fellows,\u201d a sports journalism internship program focused on identifying and training aspiring African American journalists from historically black colleges and universities.\n\nIn Silicon Valley, Google partnered with Howard University to launch a school branch on the company\u2019s campus, where undergraduate students will learn from Google engineers in addition to the university\u2019s own faculty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe New York-based Theatre Communications Group began a theater criticism and journalism track in Rising Leaders of Color, \u201cdesigned to deepen the pool of voices documenting, reflecting, and challenging the field.\u201d\n\nA post-mortem from the Michigan Civil Rights Commission on the Flint water crisis harkened back to the language of Kerner, saying that historic and systemic racism played a role in the public health catastrophe.\n\n\u201cThe limited coverage begs the same question of the media that we ask of decision makers: Would things have been covered differently if it wasn\u2019t Flint? Might the story have led the news, would stories have been more extensive? Most critical, would reporters have pushed government officials to provide acceptable answers? Those who made decisions on what stories to cover and how to do so will doubtlessly insist that race played no part in their decision making, that such factors were not considered at all.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. Jemele Hill Saga Prompts Warnings About Twitter\n\n\u201cOn Monday, Jemele Hill returns to The Six after a two-week suspension for violating ESPN\u2019s social media policy,\u201d Bryan Curtis wrote on Oct. 22 for theringer.com.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut a key meeting happened Sunday, when Hill sat down with ESPN president John Skipper. According to two sources, the meeting occurred away from the Bristol campus; Hill and Skipper were alone. . . . It was the first time the two met since September 13, two days after Hill called President Donald Trump a white supremacist on Twitter and the day that the Trump White House called for her to be fired. As Hill wrote in The Undefeated, she cried during that meeting.\n\n\u201cHill\u2019s suspension is both ESPN bureaucratic intrigue and a national political cause that has been joined by everyone from J.R. Smith to the ACLU. . . .\u201d\n\nOn Nov. 2, Jeremy Barr wrote for the Hollywood Reporter that, \u201cthe network publicly released a new set of social media guidelines that deal with social and political issues. The effort was led by Kevin Merida, the former Washington Post managing editor who runs the ESPN property The Undefeated. . . .\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cA section of the guidelines deal specifically with commentaries. ESPN employees are told: \u2018Commentaries on relevant sports-related issues are appropriate, but we should refrain from overt partisanship or endorsement of particular candidates, politicians or political parties. ... We should offer balance or recognize opposing views, as warranted. We should avoid personal attacks and inflammatory rhetoric.\u2019\n\n\u201cWhile Skipper told Sports Business Daily that the guidelines were not released in response to Hill\u2019s case, Hill initially got in trouble for writing on Twitter that Donald Trump is a \u2018white supremacist,\u2019 which would likely be considered \u2018inflammatory rhetoric\u2019 under the new guidelines. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. Ebony\u2019s New Ownership Disappoints\n\nPerhaps no development created more disappointment among black journalists than the unrealized promise of Ebony magazine under its new owner, Clear View Group, a black-owned Texas company.\n\nAlong with Fox News, Ebony was awarded this year\u2019s Thumbs Down Award from the National Association of Black Journalists. NABJ said the magazine \u201chas made headlines this year because of staff cuts; the relocation of its headquarters from its founding base in Chicago to Los Angeles [actually, only editorial offices were relocated there]; and, its very public and sometimes offensive responses to reports of late or non-payment for work already performed by staff or freelance journalists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c \u2018Many of the decisions being made by Ebony\u2019s new owners seem counter to the vision of founder John H. Johnson,\u2019 said NABJ Vice President of Print Marlon A. Walker. \u2018Ebony and its sister publication Jet are near and dear to us. To hear writers whose words bring us much joy aren\u2019t being paid for those words is sad, unconscionable, unacceptable.\u2019 . . .\u201d\n\nEbony received a constant stream of negative publicity almost since Clear View purchased the magazine in 2016 from the Johnson Publishing Co., headed by Linda Johnson Rice, daughter of the founders. Writers filed suit over nonpayment and personnel have frequently changed.\n\nTracey M. Ferguson, who in February was named editor-in-chief of a revived Jet magazine, then in May was also given the editorship of Ebony, left the company, Ferguson confirmed in October.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe National Writers Union said in December it is in court representing 48 freelancers who are owed more than $80,000 by Ebony, and says its next court date is Friday.\n\n8. Investigative Reporting Gets a Boost\n\nIn June, the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation awarded $150,000 to the new Ida B. Wells Society for Investigative Reporting to expand its training programs aimed at supporting journalists of color interested in that crucial specialty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c \u2018There are a lot of journalists of color who want to be doing [investigative] reporting, but don\u2019t see a path for themselves and have never seen other journalists of color doing this job,\u2019 New York Times Magazine reporter Nikole Hannah-Jones, one of the Ida B. Wells Society\u2019s co-founders, told my colleague Ricardo Bilton earlier this year,\u201d Joseph Lichterman wrote then for Nieman Report.\n\n\n\n\u201c \u2018When you learn about journalism heroes in college, they are white \u2014 usually white men. It\u2019s important that journalists of color see themselves in these positions and get to be trained by people whose experiences are similar to theirs.\u2019 \u201d\n\nUncovering wrongdoing is one of the basic missions of journalistic organizations, one that can best be fulfilled by media with the resources, commitment and experience to give consumers more than opinion pieces and rewriting of others\u2019 work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen the Kerner Commission took the news media to task 50 years ago, insisting that \u201cthey must make a reality of integration \u2014 in both their product and personnel,\u201d it also said, \u201cthey must report the travail of our cities with compassion and in depth\u201d [PDF \u2014 Go to Chapter 15].\n\nIn too many cases, the investigative reporting listed below \u2014 just a few examples \u2014 did not involve journalists of color. But in most cases, it did make life better for people of color, or strive to.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, the Boston Globe and the Atlanta Journal-Constitution all undertook series examining race relations in their cities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn March, the Marshall Project and the Washington Post \u201crevealed that 19 state juvenile-justice agencies regularly or sometimes require parents to pay for the cost of their children\u2019s incarcerations. Counties in another 28 states also routinely engage in the practice,\u201d Bill Keller, editor-in-chief of the Marshall Project, wrote to email subscribers. \u201cThe City of Philadelphia, where the story was focused, announced a few hours after our story was published that it would end the practice of charging parents who have kids in detention. . . .\u201d\n\nIn October, the Miami Herald reported on \u201cFight Club,\u201d a multimedia investigative series that focused on Florida\u2019s Department of Juvenile Justice. \u201cThe Herald investigation revealed a system rife with problems: Staffers organized and bet on fights between kids; workers were hired despite their criminal backgrounds; 12 juvenile detainees died in state care since 2000,\u201d Deirdra Funcheon noted in Columbia Journalism Review.\n\nThe Charlotte Observer wrote about prison corruption in North Carolina, prompting a state review.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn March, Jodi S. Cohen and Jennifer Smith Richards reported for the Chicago Tribune that \u201cChicago officers found at fault for misconduct have escaped punishment for years because authorities lost track of their cases, a Tribune investigation has found.\u201d\n\nThe Commercial Appeal in Memphis looked at Memphis\u2019 broadening epidemic of gun assaults, in which 7,000 people had been murdered on Memphis streets since 1960.\n\nThe investigations extended overseas. In November, Nima Elbagir, Raja Razek, Alex Platt and Bryony Jones verified for CNN the existence of slave auctions in Libya.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn April, following a Washington Post investigation, \u201cApple said it has temporarily stopped buying cobalt mined by hand in Congo while it continues to deal with problems with child labor and harsh work conditions,\u201d the Post\u2019s Todd C. Frankel reported.\n\n9. A Transition in Indian Country\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndian Country Today Media Network, the most comprehensive source of original reporting about Native Americans, \u201cis taking a hiatus to consider alternative business models,\u201d Publisher Ray Halbritter of the Oneida Indian Nation announced on Sept. 4.\n\n\n\nThe National Congress of American Indians announced the next month that is assuming control of the assets of Indian Country Today Media Network, the result of a donation to the organization by the Oneida nation.\n\nNo one can debate the need for strong reporting from Indian Country. \u201cThere is no doubt that Standing Rock changed the way national media outlets think about Indian Country,\u201d Graham Lee Brewer wrote in November for High Country News.\u201dMore than a year after thousands of people gathered to stop the construction of an oil pipeline over Sioux protests, the desire to tell the stories of Indigenous communities is stronger than ever. Unfortunately there aren\u2019t enough publications that know how to tell those stories accurately. Yes, many of these accounts are technically factual, but media have a hard time, even today, properly representing Native communities across the country. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Atlantic magazine\u2019s acclaimed January/February cover story \u201cMy President Was Black\u201d by Ta-Nehisi Coates mistakenly reported that \u201cAfrican Americans rank at the bottom of nearly every major socioeconomic measure in the country.\u201d According to the U.S. Census Bureau, that dubious distinction belongs to Native Americans. Their omission is \u201cfairly common,\u201d Bryan Pollard, Cherokee, president of the Native American Journalists Association, told Journal-isms.\n\nIn good news for Native people, \u201cThe Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde joined an increasing number of other Native American Tribes nationwide in adopting an Independent Press Ordinance that will codify that the Tribal news publication has the independence to report Grand Ronde news objectively and free from undue political influence by Tribal elected officials,\u201d the Native American Journalists Association announced last January from Grand Ronde, Ore.\n\nThe news is significant because \u201ca free press is the exception and not the rule\u201d in Indian Country, Pollard said then.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10.

It\u2019s still the most popular on Facebook and most emailed,\u201d she messaged.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Caroline Linton reported Thursday for CBS News, \u201cIda B. Wells, who was born a slave in 1862 and went on to become the most famous black woman of her time as a journalist and civil rights activist, never had an obituary in The New York Times. Neither did accomplished authors Sylvia Plath or Charlotte Bront\u00eb, or photographer Diane Arbus. They are among the women highlighted in a new series called \u2018Overlooked\u2019 that will publish obituaries for women who were not singled out for the honor at the time.\n\n\u201cThe first set of obituaries were rolled out March 8 \u2014 International Women\u2019s Day. New York Times national reporter Caitlin Dickerson, who wrote Wells\u2019 obituary, told CBSN\u2019s Elaine Quijano the paper is \u2018acknowledging now that the New York Times was, quite honestly, part of the problem.\u2019\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c \u2018The New York Times is the paper of record \u2014 it always, to a certain extent, reflected the culture of the moment,\u2019 Dickerson said. \u2018When we talk about Ida B. Wells, for example, born in the 1860s, we\u2019re talking about a moment when we, as a general culture, didn\u2019t pay attention to African Americans \u2014 especially African American women.\u2019\n\n\u201cDickerson said \u2018everybody in the building\u2019 was eager to be involved. \u2018I think this is going to be a rolling project,\u2019 Dickerson said.\n\n\u201cThe interest, Dickerson noted, reflects how important the issues of gender and inequality are even in a time of fast-breaking news. As Quijano pointed out, even in the last two years, only 20 percent of obituaries are written about women. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichael McCann, Sports Illustrated: Breaking Down Adrienne Lawrence\u2019s Lawsuit Against ESPN and the Company\u2019s Possible Defenses\n\nD.

RSF has established that from 2012 to 2017, the rights of at least 90 journalists in around 20 countries were seriously violated because they dared to cover or talk about women\u2019s rights or gender issues.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSeveral months of research has yielded the following chilling breakdown of these cases: 11 of these journalists were murdered, 12 were imprisoned, at least 25 were physically attacked, and at least 40 others were or are still being threatened on social networks.\n\n\u201cIn India, Gauri Lankesh, the editor of the secular and feminist weekly Gauri Lankesh Patrike, paid with her life for articles that criticized the woman\u2019s place in the caste system. She was gunned down on September 5, 2017. In Iran, many feminist journalists have been subjected to judicial harassment and imprisonment in connection with their writing.\n\n\u201cThey include Mansoureh Shojaee, who now lives in exile, and Narges Mohammadi, who is still detained. However, it is not just women journalists who are persecuted by the enemies of women\u2019s rights.

Only a quarter of Latino heads of household own their own homes in the state, compared to 69 percent of whites \u2014 the largest divide nationwide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBlack households in Massachusetts, by comparison, have a median income of $46,381, and 34 percent own homes.\n\n\u201cLanguage barriers and immigration status play a major role in the inequity \u2014 here and across the country \u2014 making it difficult for Latinos to progress beyond low-wage jobs or speak up about unfair treatment.\n\n\u201cBut there are added challenges in Massachusetts: a high cost of living and a majority of jobs that require college education, along with long waiting lists for English classes and a 15-year-old law \u2014 effectively overturned a few months ago \u2014 that eliminated bilingual education from most public schools. There are also relatively few Latino leaders and nonprofits, leading to low levels of civic engagement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPuerto Ricans, the largest group of Latinos in the state, struggle more than most, with fewer of them working or in school than among other Latino sub-populations.\n\n\u201cThen there\u2019s Boston\u2019s history of discrimination against black people, which dominates discussions about race.\n\n\u201c \u2018There\u2019s that feeling of, you\u2019re African-American or you\u2019re white, but there\u2019s no in-between,\u2019 said a Boston Police Department officer of Puerto Rican heritage who asked not to be identified. \u2018We\u2019re almost like the folks that nobody pays attention to.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAs a number of Latinos put it: They feel invisible here. . . .\u201d\n\nJohn Eggerton, Broadcasting & Cable: FCC to Help Fund Network Rebuilds in Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands\n\nLester Holt Didn\u2019t \u2018Want to Be Defined by My Color\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsked about being the first African American solo anchor of a weekday network nightly newscast, Lester Holt said he was honored and inspired by the impact of his career beyond the anchor desk, Chandelis R. Duster reported Feb. 28 for NBCBLK.\n\n\u201c \u2018Kids can now look around and see someone who looks like them on TV,\u2019 he said at New York\u2019s Paley Center for Media as \u201cNBC Nightly News\u201d celebrated 70 years.\n\n\u201cSaying he himself was inspired by journalists like Bernard Shaw, Bryant Gumbel, and others, Holt reflected on the impact of African-Americans in media. He also spoke of challenges he faced as a journalist of color.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c \u2018There were periods of my career where there was just pressure to define myself as a black journalist and I pushed back at that because I knew I wanted to succeed and not be defined by my color,\u2019 Holt said. \u2018I think if any of us are going to succeed, it\u2019s going to be on a broad scale.\u2019 . . .\u201d\n\nNevertheless, a major career break for Holt came as a result of pressure from African Americans pushing for diversity. He \u201clives by the words a mentor once said to him early in his career: Prepare yourself to walk through doors of opportunity that will swing open when you least expect them to,\u201d Stephen Battaglio wrote in 2015 for the Los Angeles Times.\n\n\u201cIt first happened to Holt in 1986, when he landed a major local TV anchor job. He got the gig after CBS\u2019 Chicago station WBBM demoted longtime anchor Harry Porterfield, removing an African American from the lineup of a station that had little diversity on its weekday newscasts. The Rev. Jesse Jackson and Operation PUSH led a 10-month boycott against WBBM, and Holt was moved from WCBS in New York to take over one of the nightly newscasts in Chicago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c \u2018I got that call and I was 27 years old,\u2019 Holt said. \u2018There was a tremendous amount of pressure. I didn\u2019t realize how much pressure it was going to be. \u2018 . . .\u201d\n\nVariety: Lester Holt Looks Back \u2014 and Forward \u2014 as \u2018NBC Nightly News\u2019 Celebrates 70 Years\n\nSmith Joins Hill in Leaving \u2018SportsCenter\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSports Illustrated has learned that Michael Smith\u2019s last day as an ESPN SportsCenter host will be Friday,\u201d Richard Deitsch reported Thursday for Sports Illustrated.\n\n\n\n\u201cSmith leaving the 6 p.m. SC6 edition of SportsCenter follows his former SportsCenter co-anchor Jemele Hill\u2019s decision to depart the franchise to join the staff of The Undefeated, the ESPN microsite that fuses sports, race and culture, as well as other additional assignments.\n\n\u201cBoth Hill and Smith have multiple years left on their ESPN contracts so look for Smith to craft a new role at ESPN over the next couple of months.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAs this column wrote in October when it predicted Hill\u2019s tenure as the co-host of the 6 p.m. ET edition of SportsCenter would end, Smith leaving SportsCenter is not a surprise. The SportsCenter that Hill and Smith envisioned, what made their chemistry honest and unique on the ESPN2 show His and Hers and their podcasts together, had slowly been chopped away by a desire from management to change that show to that of a traditional SportsCenter. . . .\u201d\n\nIvie E.

Hill is serving a two-week suspension for tweets that the company said violates its social media policy.\n\nWhen Sportscenter hits the air, one of the lead stories will probably be about the University of Louisville\u2019s decision on whether it will fire head coach Rick Pitino. Pitino has been implicated in a FBI investigation that alleges that he and a number of officials at other NCAA colleges paid third parties hundreds of thousands of dollars to secure recruits to their individual university athletics programs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are some who will counter that the decrees of these organizations are no different from the rules and contractual obligations of any other employer for any other company.

The NCAA is not cherry-picking which coaches to target for violating NCAA rules. Hill is not being censured for breaking ESPN\u2019s policy. Each of these entities knows that it cannot profit without the absolute control of the livestock whose talent and toiling line the pockets of the overseers.

One hundred percent of the NFL\u2019s majority owners are white. But this issue is not about color; nor does it have anything to do with the flag or the anthem. It is about a group of billionaires knowing that they cannot allow the bodies they ostensibly \u201cown\u201d to coalesce into a united, vocal force. It is about stamping out rebellion and resistance.\n\nIt is about forcing their legal property to obey.\n\nThis is the same with ESPN and Jemele Hill. ESPN claims that Hill violated its social media policy by tweeting her opinions from her personal social media account. ESPN\u2019s policy states:\n\nWriters, reporters, producers and editors directly involved in \u201chard\u201d news reporting, investigative or enterprise assignments and related coverage should refrain in any public-facing forum from taking positions on political or social issues, candidates or office holders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile it is debatable whether Hill is considered a \u201creporter,\u201d ESPN\u2019s rules also say:\n\nOutside of \u201chard\u201d news reporting, commentary related to political or social issues, candidates or office holders is appropriate on ESPN platforms consistent with these guidelines.\u201d The topic should be related to a current issue impacting sports.\n\nESPN pays Hill, in part, because she is black and outspoken. The network monetized her unapologetic blackness in the same way the NFL capitalizes on its mostly black workforce. According to AdAge, since ESPN moved Hill and co-host Michael Smith to their flagship program, the show\u2019s audience is 12 years younger and has increased its Hispanic and African-American audience by 39 percent, attracting better and higher-paying advertisers. Never forget how the network chose to promote the new, hip SC6 when it named Hill and Smith as anchors:\n\nESPN wants the unapologetic blackness without the unapologetic part. Or the black part. To ensure that, the network twisted its rules and contorted itself into a bullwhip to make sure Hill knows what not to say. How not to act. If she is to be the network\u2019s legal property, it wants to make sure she knows that she should obey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCollege athletes are no different. The FBI investigation that claimed Pitino\u2019s inviolability arbitrarily focused on a group of schools where boosters were funneling money between coaches, sports agents and shoe companies to get top recruits to commit to certain colleges. You know who wasn\u2019t making any money?\n\nCollege players.\n\nAlmost every analyst and expert who covers college sports says that these kinds of deals take place at almost every high-profile university athletic program. The NCAA, like the NFL and ESPN, selectively enforces its rules to ensure the steady flow of free labor that enriches the institution without compensating the players\u2014or, as the definition of slavery says, \u201cwithout proper remuneration or appreciation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen an investigation exposed the University of North Carolina\u2019s sham African-American-studies program that gave athletes fake grades for 18 years, absolutely nothing happened. When poor black students complete four years of eligibility without a degree after making millions for their colleges, absolutely nothing happens. College athletes can\u2019t obtain outside employment without permission. They can\u2019t leave the plantation schools if their current college won\u2019t allow it. They are \u201cexcessively dependent\u201d on their universities.\n\nWhen Donald Trump suggested that ESPN should terminate Jemele Hill or that NFL owners should fire \u201cthat son of a bitch\u201d who \u201cdisrespects our flag,\u201d he knew what he was doing. It wasn\u2019t simply a call to white supremacists who wrap themselves in patriotism because it is the \u201clast refuge of the scoundrel.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a dog whistle to his base.\n\nIt was a plea to make America great again. It was a not-so-subtle reminder that no matter how rich, successful, talented or accomplished a black person in America may be ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\n... that black person can still be a slave.", "keywords": ["jemele", "hill", "system", "slave", "espn", "nfl", "jones", "players", "policy", "social", "rules", "person", "jerry", "ncaa", "black"], "polarity": 0.040663910831436605, "subjectivity": 0.43705389684771123},

Booker, hired in 1951 by Graham\u2019s father, Philip Graham, was the first black reporter at the Post, suffering the abuse that came with being a \u201cfirst\u201d in those days.\n\nBooker, who died Dec. 10 at age 99, \u201cintegrated an industry,\u201d Graham said. At the time, he said, citing scholars, there were no other African Americans working as journalists at major newspapers (though there had been); today there are thousands. There weren\u2019t even African Americans in other departments of the newspaper. Today both the man running the Post\u2019s pressroom and the woman who serves as his deputy are black.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBooker \u201copened the door and thousands of others passed through it.\u201d\n\nThe icon later known as \u201cthe man from Jet\u201d would stay just two years. \u201c \u2018God knows, I tried to succeed at the Post,\u201d he would say later. \u201cI struggled so hard that friends thought I was dying, I looked so fatigued. After a year and a half, I had to give up. Trying to cover news in a city where even animal cemeteries were segregated overwhelmed me.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1954, the legend-to-be joined the black-owned Johnson Publishing Co. to write for the weekly Jet and the monthly Ebony. \u201cBooker ventured into the South and sent back dispatches that reached black readers across the United States,\u201d as Emily Langer reported for the Post.\n\n\n\nFrom Monday\u2019s pulpit, Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., said that as he read Booker\u2019s dispatches, \u201cI felt liberated. I felt a whole world was opening up to me in rural Alabama.\u201d The civil rights hero noted, \u201cIt was dangerous to be a reporter with a pen and a camera,\u201d recalling that sometimes Booker would carry \u201ca Bible to look like a preacher or overalls to look like a sharecropper. . . .\n\n\u201cIf it hadn\u2019t been for Booker, the civil rights movement would have been like a bird without wings,\u201d Lewis said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBooker was best known for his coverage of the abduction and killing of 14-year-old Emmett Till, who was visiting Money, Miss., from Chicago. Christopher D. Benson, who now teaches at Northwestern University, worked under Booker in the Washington Bureau of Johnson Publishing. He told of how closely Booker worked with Till\u2019s mother, Mamie Till Mobley, to publicize the atrocity visited upon the teenager.\n\nRelating those stories to today\u2019s headlines, Monsignor Raymond East chose \u201crolling way the stone\u201d as the theme of his homily, declaring the need for \u201crolling away the stone of lies and untruth.\u201d\n\nTaking this in was a crowd estimated at 400 or 500 in the cavernous Washington National Cathedral, which seats 2,400. Hardly any of the mourners were millennials or from Generation Y.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike Sarah Glover, president of the National Association of Black Journalists; Eleanor Holmes Norton, congressional delegate from the District of Columbia; anchor Bruce Johnson of Washington\u2019s WUSA-TV; Yanick Rice Lamb, chairman of the Howard University Department of Media, Journalism and Film; Ernest Green of the \u201cLittle Rock Nine,\u201d and talk-show host and activist Joe Madison, the attendees were mostly a seasoned, self-selected group invested in professions that taught them the value of Booker\u2019s contribution.\n\n\u201cI was born the year Booker came to The Post, and 24 years later I became one of the thousands who passed through that door,\u201d Courtland Milloy wrote Monday in the Post.\n\n\u201cListening to recollections about Booker\u2019s journey, I couldn\u2019t imagine myself or any other journalist today blazing such a path.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe list of honorary ushers, most of whom were present, gives an idea of that select group:\n\nJeffrey Ballou, Clayton Boyce, Paul Delaney, Michael Fletcher, Wesley Lowery, Kevin Merida, Reginald Stuart, Betty Anne Williams, Glover, Roy Betts, Roy Lewis, Milton Williams, Richette Haywood, Barbara Best, Edgar Brookins, Hazel Edney, Enid Doggett, Tony Perkins, Maureen Bunyan, Denise Rolark Barnes, Dorothy Leavell, Lon Walls, Barbara Arnwine, Todd Franko and Derrick A.

The dynamics you see during the interview process will come back to haunt you if you take the job. Is the manager disorganized? How does the manager treat the receptionist?

They want everyone else in America to see us as a threat so that when we are killed with impunity, no one bats an eyelash. This is already happening anyway.\n\nIn a country that was founded on the principles of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, it appears that you can fully reap those benefits only if you are not black, and if you are black and want those benefits, then you need to keep your mouth closed so that you can have the illusion of getting them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe new buzz phrase is \u201cblack identity extremists,\u201d and since it has been coined by the FBI, we can accurately assume that this is COINTELPRO 2.0. It will not stop here. They are painting us with a wide brush and making us the enemy because we dare demand equal treatment and justice. They are already finding multiple ways to create punitive damages for black people who speak out against injustice.\n\nThey want to silence black resistance, so they label it something big and scary that serves as a dog whistle to a certain base. They do this while simultaneously normalizing white supremacist and white nationalist ideology.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack people wanting justice and equality is considered \u201cextreme,\u201d while a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., complete with torches, Nazi insignia and an innocent woman being killed, is normal.\n\nAs someone said on Twitter, all we have asked is for the repeated killing of unarmed black men and women by police to stop and for justice in those cases where it does happen. This, it seems, has caused white America to lose its collective mind.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeing unapologetically black, asserting that black lives matter (the \u201ctoo\u201d is silent) and fighting for our basic human rights isn\u2019t extremism; it is the foundation this country was founded on, and these are the principles that the flag they claim is under attack represents.\n\nBut apparently that is only OK when it\u2019s white people exercising those rights.\n\nThe new plantation system is fully engaged. Instead of a whip, they attack our character and our livelihoods. Consider the case of Jemele Hill.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nESPN suspended her earlier this week because she said in a tweet that the best way to respond to Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones\u2019 demand that all of the team\u2019s players stand during the national anthem was to go after his advertisers. Nothing gets white people\u2014especially white people in positions of extreme power\u2014angrier than going after their bag, so they went after hers.\n\nThe president of the United States found time in his busy schedule to directly attack her\u2014a black woman and a journalist who operates under the presumption of freedom of speech\u2014on Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe is not the first, and she won\u2019t be the last.\n\nThey already iced Colin Kaepernick out and took his bag, making it impossible for him to play in a league he worked so hard to get into, and he didn\u2019t even say a gotdamn thing. He simply knelt during the national anthem and explained to those who asked why he was kneeling. He wanted justice. He wanted black lives to matter.\n\nApparently that is too much to ask.\n\nThey want your Colins and your Jemeles to stop talking so loud with all their uppity learning, getting all the other darkies riled up. There\u2019s no place for that here. Just be glad you are being allowed to earn a living and stay in your place. There\u2019s no need for you to be going around causing all this trouble.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExcept we aren\u2019t the ones causing the trouble; we are simply seeking an end to it.\n\nThe shaky premise of the entire \u201cblack identity extremists\u201d narrative is that in response to the unending cycle of black lives being cut down by police who are never punished, black people will react with violence against police. This is a false-flag attack. There is data that directly contradicts this narrative. The fact is, the number of police officers killed on the job (pdf) is far lower than the number of civilians killed by police, and when police are killed by citizens, statistics suggest that it is more often by white perpetrators than black.\n\nBlack Lives Matter demonstrations are not violent. There are no torches. No one is being attacked except, usually, the demonstrators themselves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe can\u2019t talk about justice. We can\u2019t march for justice. We can\u2019t kneel for justice and we can\u2019t tweet for justice.\n\nAll of these things are being treated as extreme, when, in fact, they are not.\n\nWhat is extreme is the narrative being crafted to make black people appear as though they are somehow in the wrong for wanting the same rights and treatment as everyone else: freedom of speech, freedom of the press and equal protection under the law.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd because the internet exists, those presenting this narrative are able to get this propaganda out faster and spread it far and wide in a way they weren\u2019t able to do in the days of Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X and the original Black Panther Party.\n\nThe base they are appealing to and using this dog whistle for exists in a media vacuum. As this message gets repeated over and over again by the FBI, the alt-Reich \u201calt-right\u201d media and the president himself, it becomes a call to action for them.\n\nAnd because their ideology is being normalized, no one will be shocked or surprised when they act out in racially motivated attacks against us. Hell, no one is surprised when it happens now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey want us to appear to be the enemy on our own soil because doing so allows their white supremacist system to continue to exist. All of these acts against black people and the Movement for Black Lives are the real extremism.\n\nBut because the voices speaking out against it are largely black, no one is listening.\n\n(Shoutout to Feminista Jones by way of @N7IRL for inspiring this headline with her Twitter display name.)", "keywords": ["lives", "extreme", "isnt", "cant", "human", "extremism", "justice", "bie", "white", "killed", "narrative", "basic", "fighting", "way", "black", "felicia", "rights", "attack"], "polarity": -0.009294426747256933, "subjectivity": 0.4409625228021452},

First, dip the brush into the liquid adhesive and apply it to your eyelid, allowing about 30-60 seconds to dry. While it\u2019s still wet, dip the same brush into the pot of glitter\u2014which is ground so fine it looks like a powder\u2014and brush the glitter onto your lids.\n\nVoil\u00e0! The effect is instant, and the gold pigment is likely what you\u2019ve been looking for in a dry or cream shadow but could never find.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPersonally, I felt the liquid adhesive drying and tightening a little for about 15 minutes afterward, and was aware of feeling something on my lids for about a half hour before I got used to the feeling. A few tricks: Avoid the crease of your eye\u2014unless you have ample time to sit with your eyes closed, it\u2019s very difficult for the adhesive to dry in the fold in the lid, and it will feel sticky for long time. If it happens, just moisten a cotton swab with water and wipe it away. Also, make sure to comb your lashes out immediately afterward in case a stray sparkle goes rogue and lands in the base of your lashes.\n\nFor a more dimensional look, you can layer the adhesive and Lit Kit glitter over regular eye shadow. Another easy and quick day-to-night makeup transformation is to use the glitter as a liquid eyeliner\u2014it takes five minutes. For golden lids, Addicted is now my go-to color, and I used Smolder for a sleek and shimmering eyeliner. Lit Kits give you glittery glamour for $28.

Neither did accomplished authors Sylvia Plath or Charlotte Bront\u00eb, or photographer Diane Arbus.

There are also relatively few Latino leaders and nonprofits, leading to low levels of civic engagement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPuerto Ricans, the largest group of Latinos in the state, struggle more than most, with fewer of them working or in school than among other Latino sub-populations.\n\n\u201cThen there\u2019s Boston\u2019s history of discrimination against black people, which dominates discussions about race.\n\n\u201c \u2018There\u2019s that feeling of, you\u2019re African-American or you\u2019re white, but there\u2019s no in-between,\u2019 said a Boston Police Department officer of Puerto Rican heritage who asked not to be identified. \u2018We\u2019re almost like the folks that nobody pays attention to.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAs a number of Latinos put it: They feel invisible here. . . .\u201d\n\nJohn Eggerton, Broadcasting & Cable: FCC to Help Fund Network Rebuilds in Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands\n\nLester Holt Didn\u2019t \u2018Want to Be Defined by My Color\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsked about being the first African American solo anchor of a weekday network nightly newscast, Lester Holt said he was honored and inspired by the impact of his career beyond the anchor desk, Chandelis R. Duster reported Feb. 28 for NBCBLK.\n\n\u201c \u2018Kids can now look around and see someone who looks like them on TV,\u2019 he said at New York\u2019s Paley Center for Media as \u201cNBC Nightly News\u201d celebrated 70 years.\n\n\u201cSaying he himself was inspired by journalists like Bernard Shaw, Bryant Gumbel, and others, Holt reflected on the impact of African-Americans in media. He also spoke of challenges he faced as a journalist of color.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c \u2018There were periods of my career where there was just pressure to define myself as a black journalist and I pushed back at that because I knew I wanted to succeed and not be defined by my color,\u2019 Holt said. \u2018I think if any of us are going to succeed, it\u2019s going to be on a broad scale.\u2019 . . .\u201d\n\nNevertheless, a major career break for Holt came as a result of pressure from African Americans pushing for diversity. He \u201clives by the words a mentor once said to him early in his career: Prepare yourself to walk through doors of opportunity that will swing open when you least expect them to,\u201d Stephen Battaglio wrote in 2015 for the Los Angeles Times.\n\n\u201cIt first happened to Holt in 1986, when he landed a major local TV anchor job. He got the gig after CBS\u2019 Chicago station WBBM demoted longtime anchor Harry Porterfield, removing an African American from the lineup of a station that had little diversity on its weekday newscasts. The Rev. Jesse Jackson and Operation PUSH led a 10-month boycott against WBBM, and Holt was moved from WCBS in New York to take over one of the nightly newscasts in Chicago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c \u2018I got that call and I was 27 years old,\u2019 Holt said. \u2018There was a tremendous amount of pressure. I didn\u2019t realize how much pressure it was going to be. \u2018 . . .\u201d\n\nVariety: Lester Holt Looks Back \u2014 and Forward \u2014 as \u2018NBC Nightly News\u2019 Celebrates 70 Years\n\nSmith Joins Hill in Leaving \u2018SportsCenter\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSports Illustrated has learned that Michael Smith\u2019s last day as an ESPN SportsCenter host will be Friday,\u201d Richard Deitsch reported Thursday for Sports Illustrated.\n\n\n\n\u201cSmith leaving the 6 p.m. SC6 edition of SportsCenter follows his former SportsCenter co-anchor Jemele Hill\u2019s decision to depart the franchise to join the staff of The Undefeated, the ESPN microsite that fuses sports, race and culture, as well as other additional assignments.\n\n\u201cBoth Hill and Smith have multiple years left on their ESPN contracts so look for Smith to craft a new role at ESPN over the next couple of months.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAs this column wrote in October when it predicted Hill\u2019s tenure as the co-host of the 6 p.m. ET edition of SportsCenter would end, Smith leaving SportsCenter is not a surprise.

He joined the AP in 1993 after working five years as a marketing specialist for the state of Hawaii.\n\n\u201cThe AP named him chief of bureau in Honolulu on Jan. 1, 1994.

I haven\u2019t actively been boycotting; somehow, the NFL just doesn\u2019t seem as enticing to me as it used to, so I\u2019ve made no effort to watch any of it. And I was an NFL stan. It\u2019s my favorite sport to watch. Of all the professional sports leagues, I was most invested in the NFL, and while you could find me in the trap, you could also find me sitting in front of my television religiously every Sunday watching whatever football games were on.\n\nI seem to have lost that loving feeling. Temporarily, at least. And those six downs I\u2019ve seen? I recently flew down to New Orleans, and the Thursday-night game was on in the airport.\n\nSo why am I less invested? Is it because I\u2019m tired of the players taking a stand and invoking politics in football? Of course not. I\u2019m all for that shit. Hell, I both have a Colin Kaepernick jersey AND copped one of the #IMWITHKAP T-shirts from his website. Fight all the powers. I want them to keep doing it. In fact, I want them to ENTIRELY and collectively all kneel JUST to stick it to Roger Goodell, who thinks that now is the time for everybody to stand for the anthem. (I know this won\u2019t happen.)\n\nHear this and hear this good: Fuck the anthem and fuck Roger Goodell. And fuck Jerry Jones and any other owner who thinks that somehow the protests are about the anthem or the flag or the military as opposed to the real issues at stake in the very communities from which many of the athletes employed by the league come. Fuck them all. Fuck ESPN, too, for suspending Jemele Hill FOR DOING HER ACTUAL JOB. If she can\u2019t talk about football and an actual football team, what the fuck else is she supposed to do?\n\nReal talk, I hope that Jemele just quits. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s under contract, so she probably can\u2019t, but #IStandWithJemele, and while maybe she doesn\u2019t feel like \u201cFuck ESPN\u201d\u2014perhaps they\u2019ve been real good to her up until this point\u2014I\u2019m fuck ESPN yesterday, fuck ESPN today and fuck ESPN tomorrow. Oh, I lost my point. I hope that Jemele can quit and just go anywhere else and be awesome and spit her game and talk her shit for more money and with more freedom.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOh, and fuck Donald Trump, too. Because always fuck Trump. For many reasons, but in this case, for his own vendetta against NFL players. Like, shit, man, go run a country or something. And good lord, Mike Pence. Man, I hate that motherfucker, too. So so much.\n\nAnd white people, dear white people, get over yourselves. If you are truly distracted and incensed by a bunch of black men giving a fuck about something OTHER than football utilizing the only platform you people\u2014yes, you people\u2014respect, then I feel sorry for your mothers. All of them. MOST folks don\u2019t give a shit about the national anthem. Sorry, y\u2019all really don\u2019t. Y\u2019all give more of a fuck about \u201cSweet Caroline\u201d than singing the national anthem.\n\nSure, everybody stands up and either takes a hat off or places their hand over their heart, but that\u2019s probably because you were taught to do that in elementary school and it\u2019s a force of habit. But I find it hard to believe that everybody really gives THIS much of a fuck about the flag or the national anthem. Some do. But this many? Please. This is like those moments where you don\u2019t really care about shit until somebody else doesn\u2019t fuck with it, then you decide you fuck with it hardbody ONLY because they don\u2019t fuck with it, like Kid Rock or kale.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhite people: Seriously, y\u2019all spend so much time acting like this ain\u2019t black folks\u2019 country\u2014how can you be mad when we don\u2019t give a shit about the symbols of it? ESPECIALLY WHEN THAT\u2019S NOT WHAT IT\u2019S ABOUT! The only white people most of us trust are the ones on our money, and even then we\u2019d prefer to see black faces. Harriet Tubman, anybody? Tubman, please. But somehow, again, black men giving a shit about themselves distracts you all from the truly important reason for the gathering\u2014 patriotism football.\n\nShit, so yeah, I entirely lost my point. But that\u2019s kind of the point. It\u2019s been hard for me to get excited for the football season because of everything surrounding it and just how fucking white the country has gone over football. Obviously, football is a white-consumer sport\u2014those white dollars drive the television contracts. But everybody from the owners to the commissioner to the president to ESPN to all of these folks butt-hurt over a respectful, PEACEFUL, nonviolent protest are what\u2019s ruining football (such that it\u2019s ruined), not the players.\n\nThis whole country was founded on white people\u2019s lack of respect for others (rape, pillage and murder of indigenous peoples) and their fucking protest and conquest for religious freedom.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFreedom.\n\nHow come when groups that have been historically persecuted by the very fuckers who took their religious freedom into their own hands just say, \u201cHey man, shit still sucks \u2019round here\u2014we\u2019re going to quietly address this,\u201d it\u2019s time to call up Bull Connor\u2019s corpse and get the dogs out again? Over a fucking sideline peaceful protest. White people were throwing Lipton into the waters of Lake Minnetonka Boston Harbor. Tea, fam. Throwing away perfectly good nonperishable items. How come white people forget their own history when it comes time for others to, ya know, get some of that freedom shit?\n\nBut again, this is my point. All of this has nothing to do with football. When I think football now, I think of bullshit and bullshit people and white folks white-folkin\u2019 like they\u2019ve never white-folked before. And it just makes me not feel like paying attention. Also, my team is the Washington Racists. So there\u2019s that ball of wax, too. I honestly have no idea what their record is or their standing in the NFC East. I heard that Odell Beckham is hurt and J.J. Watt, too. Unfortunately, this season of the sport I love is just doing too much for me.

First, dip the brush into the liquid adhesive and apply it to your eyelid, allowing about 30-60 seconds to dry. While it\u2019s still wet, dip the same brush into the pot of glitter\u2014which is ground so fine it looks like a powder\u2014and brush the glitter onto your lids.\n\nVoil\u00e0!

A few tricks: Avoid the crease of your eye\u2014unless you have ample time to sit with your eyes closed, it\u2019s very difficult for the adhesive to dry in the fold in the lid, and it will feel sticky for long time. If it happens, just moisten a cotton swab with water and wipe it away. Also, make sure to comb your lashes out immediately afterward in case a stray sparkle goes rogue and lands in the base of your lashes.\n\nFor a more dimensional look, you can layer the adhesive and Lit Kit glitter over regular eye shadow. Another easy and quick day-to-night makeup transformation is to use the glitter as a liquid eyeliner\u2014it takes five minutes.

Only a quarter of Latino heads of household own their own homes in the state, compared to 69 percent of whites \u2014 the largest divide nationwide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBlack households in Massachusetts, by comparison, have a median income of $46,381, and 34 percent own homes.\n\n\u201cLanguage barriers and immigration status play a major role in the inequity \u2014 here and across the country \u2014 making it difficult for Latinos to progress beyond low-wage jobs or speak up about unfair treatment.\n\n\u201cBut there are added challenges in Massachusetts: a high cost of living and a majority of jobs that require college education, along with long waiting lists for English classes and a 15-year-old law \u2014 effectively overturned a few months ago \u2014 that eliminated bilingual education from most public schools. There are also relatively few Latino leaders and nonprofits, leading to low levels of civic engagement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPuerto Ricans, the largest group of Latinos in the state, struggle more than most, with fewer of them working or in school than among other Latino sub-populations.\n\n\u201cThen there\u2019s Boston\u2019s history of discrimination against black people, which dominates discussions about race.\n\n\u201c \u2018There\u2019s that feeling of, you\u2019re African-American or you\u2019re white, but there\u2019s no in-between,\u2019 said a Boston Police Department officer of Puerto Rican heritage who asked not to be identified. \u2018We\u2019re almost like the folks that nobody pays attention to.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAs a number of Latinos put it: They feel invisible here. . . .\u201d\n\nJohn Eggerton, Broadcasting & Cable: FCC to Help Fund Network Rebuilds in Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands\n\nLester Holt Didn\u2019t \u2018Want to Be Defined by My Color\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsked about being the first African American solo anchor of a weekday network nightly newscast, Lester Holt said he was honored and inspired by the impact of his career beyond the anchor desk, Chandelis R. Duster reported Feb. 28 for NBCBLK.\n\n\u201c \u2018Kids can now look around and see someone who looks like them on TV,\u2019 he said at New York\u2019s Paley Center for Media as \u201cNBC Nightly News\u201d celebrated 70 years.\n\n\u201cSaying he himself was inspired by journalists like Bernard Shaw, Bryant Gumbel, and others, Holt reflected on the impact of African-Americans in media. He also spoke of challenges he faced as a journalist of color.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c \u2018There were periods of my career where there was just pressure to define myself as a black journalist and I pushed back at that because I knew I wanted to succeed and not be defined by my color,\u2019 Holt said. \u2018I think if any of us are going to succeed, it\u2019s going to be on a broad scale.\u2019 . . .\u201d\n\nNevertheless, a major career break for Holt came as a result of pressure from African Americans pushing for diversity. He \u201clives by the words a mentor once said to him early in his career: Prepare yourself to walk through doors of opportunity that will swing open when you least expect them to,\u201d Stephen Battaglio wrote in 2015 for the Los Angeles Times.\n\n\u201cIt first happened to Holt in 1986, when he landed a major local TV anchor job. He got the gig after CBS\u2019 Chicago station WBBM demoted longtime anchor Harry Porterfield, removing an African American from the lineup of a station that had little diversity on its weekday newscasts. The Rev. Jesse Jackson and Operation PUSH led a 10-month boycott against WBBM, and Holt was moved from WCBS in New York to take over one of the nightly newscasts in Chicago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c \u2018I got that call and I was 27 years old,\u2019 Holt said. \u2018There was a tremendous amount of pressure. I didn\u2019t realize how much pressure it was going to be. \u2018 . . .\u201d\n\nVariety: Lester Holt Looks Back \u2014 and Forward \u2014 as \u2018NBC Nightly News\u2019 Celebrates 70 Years\n\nSmith Joins Hill in Leaving \u2018SportsCenter\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSports Illustrated has learned that Michael Smith\u2019s last day as an ESPN SportsCenter host will be Friday,\u201d Richard Deitsch reported Thursday for Sports Illustrated.\n\n\n\n\u201cSmith leaving the 6 p.m. SC6 edition of SportsCenter follows his former SportsCenter co-anchor Jemele Hill\u2019s decision to depart the franchise to join the staff of The Undefeated, the ESPN microsite that fuses sports, race and culture, as well as other additional assignments.\n\n\u201cBoth Hill and Smith have multiple years left on their ESPN contracts so look for Smith to craft a new role at ESPN over the next couple of months.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAs this column wrote in October when it predicted Hill\u2019s tenure as the co-host of the 6 p.m. ET edition of SportsCenter would end, Smith leaving SportsCenter is not a surprise. The SportsCenter that Hill and Smith envisioned, what made their chemistry honest and unique on the ESPN2 show His and Hers and their podcasts together, had slowly been chopped away by a desire from management to change that show to that of a traditional SportsCenter. . . .\u201d\n\nIvie E.

But it did not put an end to the debates over media coverage of these groups \u2014 and the fierce criticism when news organizations produced coverage that readers saw as too \u2018normalizing\u2019.\n\n\u201cGuardian US and WNYC\u2019s On the Media have collaborated on a radio episode looking at these debates over the coverage of America\u2019s emboldened racist extremists.

And now ESPN is rewarding that uniqueness with its ultimate prize: the 6 p.m. SportsCenter slot.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think for most [sports] people, you grew up watching SportsCenter, and it\u2019s ESPN\u2019s baby,\u201d says Hill, explaining the flagship\u2019s significance. \u201cI think for us, thinking about not only the position and the reverence it holds within the company is one layer to it, but another layer to it is all the prominent, legendary broadcasters that have come through the 6 p.m. SportsCenter\u2014somebody like Stuart Scott, Keith Obermann and Dan Patrick. So to follow in those footsteps is very meaningful.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s more than meaningful. It\u2019s also historic. Hill and Smith\u2019s SportsCenter takeover is the first for a black sports duo. Of course, individual black SportsCenter anchors in the 6 p.m. slot have not been an anomaly. In the early 1990s, Robin Roberts, who joined ESPN in 1990 and enjoyed a 15-year career there, became the first black woman to co-anchor the coveted SportsCenter slot.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the transition for Hill and Smith is noteworthy in that they both initially chose print as their primary medium and enjoyed successful stints at prominent papers like the Detroit Free Press and Orlando Sentinel for Hill and the Boston Globe for Smith, at a time when black sports professionals were much rarer. That shared background, however, is largely responsible for their personal and professional chemistry.\n\n\u201cJemele and I may be on the younger side [Editor\u2019s note: Hill is 41, Smith is 37] relative to some of our colleagues at ESPN, but we\u2019re dinosaurs in that we came up through the newspaper age, where it was like, either you were on newspaper and radio, where there was damn near no black people, or on television, which had mostly black people that were former athletes,\u201d says Smith, a New Orleans native.\n\n\u201cBecause we were so like-minded,\u201d recalls Hill, who hails from Detroit, \u201cand we had kind of very parallel careers, it just built an automatic kinship. Plus, we were at a point where we were coming to Bristol a lot. Neither one of us was based in Bristol, Conn. [where ESPN is based], and we were coming a lot, and so we started to hang out and go to dinner and go to movies together, and it just kind of established itself that way.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSportsCenter may look a little different, with its updated look, but it plays no significant role in Smith and Hill\u2019s grand scheme of making it uniquely their own. Instead, the pair promise that they are not deviating far from what has brought them to the dance in the first place.\n\n\u201cWe make [SportsCenter] ours the same way we did His & Hers\u2014just by being our unapologetic selves,\u201d vows Hill. \u201cThroughout this entire process and our journey together, the one principle Mike and I have always stuck to is: No matter what, we\u2019re going to go down swinging as ourselves. We\u2019re not going to sit there and use somebody else\u2019s idea of what television is.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a sort of period of where the audience has to get used to what we bring,\u201d Hill admits. \u201cWe\u2019re a pair that, while we can be serious, we don\u2019t take ourselves too seriously. We\u2019re bringing a lot of fun and spontaneity to this brand. This is what the ESPN brass wanted. They wanted us to be us. They didn\u2019t want us to come and try to be anyone else than what we\u2019ve already been. So it\u2019s going to be our own from day one because that\u2019s the only way that we know how to approach anything.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth of them are very much aware that their \u201cbe us\u201d approach and ESPN\u2019s embracing of it owe a lot to legendary SportsCenter anchor Stuart Scott, who brought hip-hop culture to the center of the network\u2019s sports coverage long before losing his battle with cancer in 2015.\n\n\u201cStuart had a lot of conversations and took a lot of bullets so we didn\u2019t have to,\u201d says Smith. \u201cHe made it OK to be you, to take risks and be outside the box.\u201d\n\nStill, that \u201cbrand of me\u201d doesn\u2019t work on everyone. \u201cThere are people from a viewership standpoint that\u2019s just never going to feel us. We\u2019re not going to be certain people\u2019s cup of tea because they are not even willing to taste it, and that\u2019s fine,\u201d says Smith.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Smith and Hill, SportsCenter is their Cavs championship. \u201cIt\u2019s like validation for all the sacrifices we made, all the hustle, all the grind,\u201d Smith explains. \u201cIt just goes to show that, if you stay true to yourself, the rest of the world, or the rest of the industry, will eventually catch up. They\u2019ll learn to like it, and they did.\u201d\n\n", "keywords": ["going", "duo", "scott", "jemele", "smiling", "hill", "espn", "michael", "sportscenter", "way", "thats", "smith", "lot", "black", "taking", "stuart"], "polarity": 0.20560125060125053, "subjectivity": 0.539087061087061},

First, dip the brush into the liquid adhesive and apply it to your eyelid, allowing about 30-60 seconds to dry. While it\u2019s still wet, dip the same brush into the pot of glitter\u2014which is ground so fine it looks like a powder\u2014and brush the glitter onto your lids.\n\nVoil\u00e0!

A few tricks: Avoid the crease of your eye\u2014unless you have ample time to sit with your eyes closed, it\u2019s very difficult for the adhesive to dry in the fold in the lid, and it will feel sticky for long time. If it happens, just moisten a cotton swab with water and wipe it away. Also, make sure to comb your lashes out immediately afterward in case a stray sparkle goes rogue and lands in the base of your lashes.\n\nFor a more dimensional look, you can layer the adhesive and Lit Kit glitter over regular eye shadow. Another easy and quick day-to-night makeup transformation is to use the glitter as a liquid eyeliner\u2014it takes five minutes.

Kim Kimble was a star hairstylist long before her WeTV show L.A. Hair debuted in 2012, and she\u2019s still one today. Her receipts run deep: Yes, she\u2019s even slayed Queen Bey. Multiple times. On tour. Lemonade. Going way back to Austin Powers in Goldmember.\n\nAnd those bold, blond tresses on Oprah for the Ava DuVernay-directed A Wrinkle in Time? Those are the extra-platinum receipts. Like the hair boss she is, Kimble was in charge of all the unbeweaveable action in AWIT. Yep, That\u2019s Mindy Kaling, Reese Witherspoon, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Storm Reid and the whole shebang.\n\nIn the Disney big-screen adaptation of Madeleine L\u2019Engle\u2019s classic 1962 novel, a girl named Meg Murry, along with adopted brother Charles Wallace and friend Calvin O\u2019Keefe, sets out to find her scientist dad aided by celestial aides, but Hollywood and Kim Kimble found each other much more easily.\n\nKimble got her first film break creating hairstyles for the zany 1997 film B*A*P*S. And in a glimpse of things to come, her outrageous hair flair even landed the Chicago-born, Los Angeles-made hair artist on what else? The Oprah Winfrey Show!\n\nPhoto: DAndre Michael Inc.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, this isn\u2019t the first time Kimble has crossed paths with director DuVernay, either. DuVernay is a former client and collaborator on other (smaller) projects. So when DuVernay called Kimble about the $100 million Wrinkle, she minced no words: \u201cYou want to be a part of this project, because the hair is really creative. And this is something you really want to do, because it\u2019s going to be Oscar-worthy hair!\u201d\n\n\n\nHow could the hair star not be all in? And when The Glow Up caught up with Kimble in Atlanta last month, as she was closing out appearances at the Bronner Bros. International Beauty Show (which we casually know as a \u201chair show\u201d\u2014shoutout to Chris Rock\u2019s Good Hair), she dished all things hair and AWIT.\n\nOn from B*A*P*S to AWIT:\n\nI used to do a lot of fantasy hair competitions, and [director] Robert Townsend picked hairstyles I had done before in shows [for B*A*P*S]. [For Wrinkle], I had to be more creative, and I had to really search more on what to do with the hair because I really didn\u2019t have anything to reference other than the book, and these were women from the universe. And what does a woman from the universe look like? There\u2019s no real reference to that, but it was fun creating that. So I wanted something and Ava [also] wanted something that was more avant-garde, but something that was also kind of couture but very fashionable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn creating the looks for each Mrs.:\n\nI had to do a couple of meetings with Ava. That gave me ideas of how far she wanted to go with the look, and basically coming up with the color for each person. We went through, I want to say, 200 tear sheets of just ideas, and then it was very difficult to narrow down which looks, but we had to collaborate with the clothes and makeup. We had to all kind of work together to create the image of what this was going to look like because we didn\u2019t want the hair competing with the clothes, and it needed to be cohesive and go together. It took a while for the clothes to really come together, so we put some ideas out there. Then, once I got to see the clothes, I pulled from the ideas that I thought would work best with the clothes. And then we did camera tests. So we got to actually see the clothes and the hair and the makeup altogether.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Disney\n\nOn Oprah\u2019s Mrs. Which hair and what it means:\n\nTo me, I call her \u201cthe diva of the universe.\u201d Her clothes are metallic. Her hair color was metallic. We blended like platinum, gold and a little bit of bronze ... we custom-made all her hair. She was like, \u201cI don\u2019t want my ordinary color. I want something really different.\u201d Out of all the colors, this one was, to me, the most striking, and it was very soft and beautiful on her. And then, of course, her hair was big and in textures, so we did a lot of curls and big hair. She had like a long braid at one point. So I just look at her like she\u2019s the diva of the universe and her hair is made up of minerals of the earth. That\u2019s why platinum, gold and bronze and those things blended together made up her hair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Mindy Kaling\u2019s Mrs. Who hair:\n\nHer hair color didn\u2019t really change, but what was different about her is that she had a lot of texture going on. She had little braids. Her thing was more cultural. So she was all these different cultures. Like Asian, African, Spanish, Indian; all these different cultures kind of made up Mrs. Who. If you look at her clothes, she\u2019s like a quilt of just everything, and that was sort of the idea behind her image and her look. If you noticed, she had a lot of braided stuff and sculpted hairstyles.\n\nOn Reese Witherspoon\u2019s Mrs. Whatsit hair:\n\nShe was more earthy but, yet, a little fiery. She was a bit more whimsical and kind of quirky, in a way. She\u2019s almost like a flower child with a little fire, I guess. Red was something I thought was very different for Reese. ... We really wanted to create this whole other image. I didn\u2019t want you to look at her and see Reese. I wanted you to look at her and see a different person. The same thing with Oprah and Mindy. You wanted to see, like, a completely different person.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn styling Storm Reid\u2019s natural hair for Meg Murry:\n\nWe did take some things from the book because Ava, you know, she wanted to definitely be able to connect with fans of the book. The character, she had curly hair also. But, also, I thought this was a great way to go because natural hair is such a big thing and it\u2019s such a big statement. I love that women are starting to embrace and understand how to deal with [natural hair] because, for years, we didn\u2019t even know how to deal with natural hair. But her having natural hair, naturally curly hair, is great ...\n\nPhoto: Disney\n\nI think it\u2019s good for young girls to be able to look up to someone and to see this young African-American woman starring in a big film having natural hair. It\u2019s going to be great for young women to identify. Even though I do feel like this newer generation is understanding more about natural hair and embracing it more, it\u2019s great to see that on the big screen. Because for years, you had to have straight hair to be on TV. Natural hair wasn\u2019t accepted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn how AWIT even wowed her:\n\nThere was so much women power on this movie. [You had] Ava directing this big film and you got Mindy, Oprah and Reese. They\u2019re acting in this movie, but Oprah has her own network and she\u2019s got several films she\u2019s produced. Reese produced Big Little Lies and then Mindy producing her own shows. These women are powerhouses. Being able to work around these women, I loved that energy! It was just powerhouses of women throughout the whole project.\n\nThe Glow Up tip: We know you love to support black films, so let\u2019s show Hollywood that they count.

Newspaper editorials helped push it there.\n\n\u201cReporting from Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria has been one of the toughest assignments for journalists, as the island is grappling with damaged infrastructure, limited commercial flights and spotty electricity and cell service,\u201d Hadas Gold reported Wednesday for CNNMoney. \u201cAnd yet, nearly every major American English and Spanish-language broadcast, cable network and national newspaper [has] correspondents on the ground.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe networks have not necessarily deployed their big name anchors as they did for Hurricanes Harvey and Irma and the storm and its aftermath [are] not attracting the same wall-to-wall coverage. Nonetheless, intrepid journalists are still getting to the story, and sometimes become the first outsiders to reach remote areas on the island.\n\n\u201cSome reporters were in place before the hurricane hit last Wednesday. But many more have just started arriving in the past few days on the few commercial flights available, or tagging along with rescue missions and military transports. Reporters on the island are resorting to filing stories using satellite phones by dictation, relying on the few places with generators, whatever cell service and WiFi they can find (especially in the capital San Juan) and other broadcasting services like LiveU and FlyAway to get their stories online and on air.\n\n\u201c \u2018Most of the team is staying at hotels without electricity and water.

I cried because I felt I had let him and my colleagues down.\n\n\u201cSince my tweets criticizing President Donald Trump exploded into a national story, the most difficult part for me has been watching ESPN become a punching bag and seeing a dumb narrative kept alive about the company\u2019s political leanings. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHill also wrote, \u201cStill, Twitter wasn\u2019t the place to vent my frustrations because, fair or not, people can\u2019t or won\u2019t separate who I am on Twitter from the person who co-hosts the 6 p.m. SportsCenter.

These disparities are large, pervasive and remain even when considering a host of factors, including income, assets, and the court districts where debtors lived.\n\n\n\n\u201cSpecifically, we found that for people residing in majority black zip codes who file for bankruptcy, the odds of having their cases dismissed (and failing to attain lasting relief) were more than twice as high as those of debtors living in mostly white zip codes.\n\n\u201cThe main driver of this disparity is chapter choice. Black people struggling with debts are choosing to file under Chapter 13, as opposed to Chapter 7, at much higher rates. Unlike Chapter 7, which in almost all cases provides permanent debt relief within a matter of months, Chapter 13 is a particularly risky choice for these debtors, because Chapter 13 usually requires five years of payments before any debt is wiped out, and black Americans are much less likely to have the resources to run this gauntlet. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJared Kushner\u2019s Md.

Day after day, I write posts that include news about the Trump administration, and in each of those posts, I ridicule the president and his administration while simultaneously calling out the systemic racism that he and his cronies perpetuate and uplift.\n\nUnless I specifically libel or otherwise defame the president and his administration, I don\u2019t have to worry about being forced by my company to apologize for speaking the truth. I wanted that for Jemele Hill.\n\nIn the time since her tweet about Trump got the president and his amen choir all up in their feelings, Hill has continued to tweet. She\u2019s continued to do her thing and speak her mind, but there seems to be an air of caution around her now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is the social burden of being a black woman with a large platform and an engaged social media presence: People are constantly trying to shut you down when your opinions and your thoughts are too big for them to handle. When that happens, they will personally attack you, your family, the people you love, and they will almost always go after your job. That is what they did to her.\n\nThe sad part is, we are talking about her First Amendment rights, and for us as members of the media and the press, our jobs rely on that same First Amendment just to exist. Yet, even with that being true, Hill has been told over and over again that she needs to apologize.\n\nIn a recent commentary written for The Undefeated, Hill discusses the experience, the aftermath and the daily narrative that is being pushed about her and her employer in the media.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe says that she has watched ESPN \u201cbecome a punching bag\u201d as a false narrative about the company\u2019s political leanings gets pushed.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re keeping it all the way real, that narrative is often pushed by the folks in the media who benefit most from that notion and all the attention that criticism of ESPN brings,\u201d Hill writes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut this isn\u2019t about that,\u201d she continues. \u201cIt\u2019s simply indicative of just how complex things get for people in OUR position\u2014especially if you\u2019re a woman and a person of color.\u201d\n\nNeither the president nor ESPN seemed to have any problem when Sage Steele said that she experiences the most racism from black people. Steele was allowed to have her opinion and speak her truth\u2014whether we agreed with that truth or not\u2014and no one in the executive branch of our government demanded she lose her job. In fact, it would be fair to say that they probably didn\u2019t care.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut whenever you get online and call out white supremacy or white privilege, especially if you are black, and most especially if you are a black woman, you can expect the attacks to be swift and frequent.\n\nCompound that with having a large social media following and getting the kind of engagement numbers from your tweets that corporate brands only dream of, and you have a recipe for trolls, abuse and threats to your livelihood.\n\nAlthough Hill is an employee of ESPN and anchors one of its more popular shows, her Twitter account is her own personal space. At some point every day, she gets off work and is on her personal time. While she may at times talk about things related to her job on her personal Twitter account, it is her personal space that she manages. It does not belong to ESPN, and the network does not moderate it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd so she asks, \u201cYes, my job is to deliver sports commentary and news. But when do my duties to the job end and my rights as a person begin?\u201d\n\nShe adds, \u201cI honestly don\u2019t know the answer to that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is a conundrum that many of us in creative and media fields battle daily.\n\nThe level of accessibility that social media affords the general public often leads people to assume a familiarity that is not necessarily there. And because we often deliver information through our personal channels, it gives people the false impression that they are owed our time, our attention, our labor and our words.\n\nThey begin to think they own some part of us. They begin to believe that they can control what we say and what we think.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSadly, all of this has led Jemele Hill to believe that she can no longer freely express herself on Twitter.\n\n\u201cStill, Twitter wasn\u2019t the place to vent my frustrations because, fair or not, people can\u2019t or won\u2019t separate who I am on Twitter from the person who co-hosts the 6 p.m. SportsCenter. Twitter also isn\u2019t a great place to have nuanced, complicated discussions, especially when it involves race,\u201d she writes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt makes me sad that she\u2019s reached that point.\n\nLast week, the CEO of my company followed me on Twitter. I immediately felt sorry for him, because while I do use Twitter to discuss social issues and the articles I write for The Root, there is also a healthy dose of talk about sex, ratchetness, music, cusswords, incessant flirting with bearded men and everything in between.\n\nThose things sometimes make me a target for trolls and people who just generally want to attack a self-assured black woman and put her in her place. I cannot imagine how it would feel to worry that those same things could be a threat to my job as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI stand with Jemele Hill. I don\u2019t think she should have to apologize at all for speaking her truth. There are old tweets floating around that show that prior to becoming president, Trump made some highly questionable comments about then-President Barack Obama. The level of hypocrisy here is astounding.\n\nI only hope that she will continue to speak her truth and call out the lies when she sees them. That is our job as journalists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnfortunately, living with the social burden of being a black woman in media tells me that the silencing will only continue.", "keywords": ["jemele", "hill", "president", "espn", "burden", "twitter", "social", "personal", "job", "woman", "black", "media"], "polarity": 0.07739940937615354, "subjectivity": 0.4982927279438908},

First, dip the brush into the liquid adhesive and apply it to your eyelid, allowing about 30-60 seconds to dry. While it\u2019s still wet, dip the same brush into the pot of glitter\u2014which is ground so fine it looks like a powder\u2014and brush the glitter onto your lids.\n\nVoil\u00e0!

A few tricks: Avoid the crease of your eye\u2014unless you have ample time to sit with your eyes closed, it\u2019s very difficult for the adhesive to dry in the fold in the lid, and it will feel sticky for long time. If it happens, just moisten a cotton swab with water and wipe it away. Also, make sure to comb your lashes out immediately afterward in case a stray sparkle goes rogue and lands in the base of your lashes.\n\nFor a more dimensional look, you can layer the adhesive and Lit Kit glitter over regular eye shadow. Another easy and quick day-to-night makeup transformation is to use the glitter as a liquid eyeliner\u2014it takes five minutes.

It\u2019s still the most popular on Facebook and most emailed,\u201d she messaged.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Caroline Linton reported Thursday for CBS News, \u201cIda B. Wells, who was born a slave in 1862 and went on to become the most famous black woman of her time as a journalist and civil rights activist, never had an obituary in The New York Times. Neither did accomplished authors Sylvia Plath or Charlotte Bront\u00eb, or photographer Diane Arbus. They are among the women highlighted in a new series called \u2018Overlooked\u2019 that will publish obituaries for women who were not singled out for the honor at the time.\n\n\u201cThe first set of obituaries were rolled out March 8 \u2014 International Women\u2019s Day. New York Times national reporter Caitlin Dickerson, who wrote Wells\u2019 obituary, told CBSN\u2019s Elaine Quijano the paper is \u2018acknowledging now that the New York Times was, quite honestly, part of the problem.\u2019\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c \u2018The New York Times is the paper of record \u2014 it always, to a certain extent, reflected the culture of the moment,\u2019 Dickerson said. \u2018When we talk about Ida B. Wells, for example, born in the 1860s, we\u2019re talking about a moment when we, as a general culture, didn\u2019t pay attention to African Americans \u2014 especially African American women.\u2019\n\n\u201cDickerson said \u2018everybody in the building\u2019 was eager to be involved. \u2018I think this is going to be a rolling project,\u2019 Dickerson said.\n\n\u201cThe interest, Dickerson noted, reflects how important the issues of gender and inequality are even in a time of fast-breaking news. As Quijano pointed out, even in the last two years, only 20 percent of obituaries are written about women. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichael McCann, Sports Illustrated: Breaking Down Adrienne Lawrence\u2019s Lawsuit Against ESPN and the Company\u2019s Possible Defenses\n\nD.

RSF has established that from 2012 to 2017, the rights of at least 90 journalists in around 20 countries were seriously violated because they dared to cover or talk about women\u2019s rights or gender issues.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSeveral months of research has yielded the following chilling breakdown of these cases: 11 of these journalists were murdered, 12 were imprisoned, at least 25 were physically attacked, and at least 40 others were or are still being threatened on social networks.\n\n\u201cIn India, Gauri Lankesh, the editor of the secular and feminist weekly Gauri Lankesh Patrike, paid with her life for articles that criticized the woman\u2019s place in the caste system. She was gunned down on September 5, 2017. In Iran, many feminist journalists have been subjected to judicial harassment and imprisonment in connection with their writing.\n\n\u201cThey include Mansoureh Shojaee, who now lives in exile, and Narges Mohammadi, who is still detained. However, it is not just women journalists who are persecuted by the enemies of women\u2019s rights.

Only a quarter of Latino heads of household own their own homes in the state, compared to 69 percent of whites \u2014 the largest divide nationwide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBlack households in Massachusetts, by comparison, have a median income of $46,381, and 34 percent own homes.\n\n\u201cLanguage barriers and immigration status play a major role in the inequity \u2014 here and across the country \u2014 making it difficult for Latinos to progress beyond low-wage jobs or speak up about unfair treatment.\n\n\u201cBut there are added challenges in Massachusetts: a high cost of living and a majority of jobs that require college education, along with long waiting lists for English classes and a 15-year-old law \u2014 effectively overturned a few months ago \u2014 that eliminated bilingual education from most public schools. There are also relatively few Latino leaders and nonprofits, leading to low levels of civic engagement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPuerto Ricans, the largest group of Latinos in the state, struggle more than most, with fewer of them working or in school than among other Latino sub-populations.\n\n\u201cThen there\u2019s Boston\u2019s history of discrimination against black people, which dominates discussions about race.\n\n\u201c \u2018There\u2019s that feeling of, you\u2019re African-American or you\u2019re white, but there\u2019s no in-between,\u2019 said a Boston Police Department officer of Puerto Rican heritage who asked not to be identified. \u2018We\u2019re almost like the folks that nobody pays attention to.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAs a number of Latinos put it: They feel invisible here. . . .\u201d\n\nJohn Eggerton, Broadcasting & Cable: FCC to Help Fund Network Rebuilds in Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands\n\nLester Holt Didn\u2019t \u2018Want to Be Defined by My Color\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsked about being the first African American solo anchor of a weekday network nightly newscast, Lester Holt said he was honored and inspired by the impact of his career beyond the anchor desk, Chandelis R. Duster reported Feb. 28 for NBCBLK.\n\n\u201c \u2018Kids can now look around and see someone who looks like them on TV,\u2019 he said at New York\u2019s Paley Center for Media as \u201cNBC Nightly News\u201d celebrated 70 years.\n\n\u201cSaying he himself was inspired by journalists like Bernard Shaw, Bryant Gumbel, and others, Holt reflected on the impact of African-Americans in media. He also spoke of challenges he faced as a journalist of color.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c \u2018There were periods of my career where there was just pressure to define myself as a black journalist and I pushed back at that because I knew I wanted to succeed and not be defined by my color,\u2019 Holt said. \u2018I think if any of us are going to succeed, it\u2019s going to be on a broad scale.\u2019 . . .\u201d\n\nNevertheless, a major career break for Holt came as a result of pressure from African Americans pushing for diversity. He \u201clives by the words a mentor once said to him early in his career: Prepare yourself to walk through doors of opportunity that will swing open when you least expect them to,\u201d Stephen Battaglio wrote in 2015 for the Los Angeles Times.\n\n\u201cIt first happened to Holt in 1986, when he landed a major local TV anchor job. He got the gig after CBS\u2019 Chicago station WBBM demoted longtime anchor Harry Porterfield, removing an African American from the lineup of a station that had little diversity on its weekday newscasts. The Rev. Jesse Jackson and Operation PUSH led a 10-month boycott against WBBM, and Holt was moved from WCBS in New York to take over one of the nightly newscasts in Chicago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c \u2018I got that call and I was 27 years old,\u2019 Holt said. \u2018There was a tremendous amount of pressure. I didn\u2019t realize how much pressure it was going to be. \u2018 . . .\u201d\n\nVariety: Lester Holt Looks Back \u2014 and Forward \u2014 as \u2018NBC Nightly News\u2019 Celebrates 70 Years\n\nSmith Joins Hill in Leaving \u2018SportsCenter\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSports Illustrated has learned that Michael Smith\u2019s last day as an ESPN SportsCenter host will be Friday,\u201d Richard Deitsch reported Thursday for Sports Illustrated.\n\n\n\n\u201cSmith leaving the 6 p.m. SC6 edition of SportsCenter follows his former SportsCenter co-anchor Jemele Hill\u2019s decision to depart the franchise to join the staff of The Undefeated, the ESPN microsite that fuses sports, race and culture, as well as other additional assignments.\n\n\u201cBoth Hill and Smith have multiple years left on their ESPN contracts so look for Smith to craft a new role at ESPN over the next couple of months.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAs this column wrote in October when it predicted Hill\u2019s tenure as the co-host of the 6 p.m. ET edition of SportsCenter would end, Smith leaving SportsCenter is not a surprise. The SportsCenter that Hill and Smith envisioned, what made their chemistry honest and unique on the ESPN2 show His and Hers and their podcasts together, had slowly been chopped away by a desire from management to change that show to that of a traditional SportsCenter. . . .\u201d\n\nIvie E.

Kim Kimble was a star hairstylist long before her WeTV show L.A. Hair debuted in 2012, and she\u2019s still one today. Her receipts run deep: Yes, she\u2019s even slayed Queen Bey. Multiple times. On tour. Lemonade. Going way back to Austin Powers in Goldmember.\n\nAnd those bold, blond tresses on Oprah for the Ava DuVernay-directed A Wrinkle in Time? Those are the extra-platinum receipts. Like the hair boss she is, Kimble was in charge of all the unbeweaveable action in AWIT. Yep, That\u2019s Mindy Kaling, Reese Witherspoon, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Storm Reid and the whole shebang.\n\nIn the Disney big-screen adaptation of Madeleine L\u2019Engle\u2019s classic 1962 novel, a girl named Meg Murry, along with adopted brother Charles Wallace and friend Calvin O\u2019Keefe, sets out to find her scientist dad aided by celestial aides, but Hollywood and Kim Kimble found each other much more easily.\n\nKimble got her first film break creating hairstyles for the zany 1997 film B*A*P*S. And in a glimpse of things to come, her outrageous hair flair even landed the Chicago-born, Los Angeles-made hair artist on what else? The Oprah Winfrey Show!\n\nPhoto: DAndre Michael Inc.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, this isn\u2019t the first time Kimble has crossed paths with director DuVernay, either. DuVernay is a former client and collaborator on other (smaller) projects. So when DuVernay called Kimble about the $100 million Wrinkle, she minced no words: \u201cYou want to be a part of this project, because the hair is really creative. And this is something you really want to do, because it\u2019s going to be Oscar-worthy hair!\u201d\n\n\n\nHow could the hair star not be all in? And when The Glow Up caught up with Kimble in Atlanta last month, as she was closing out appearances at the Bronner Bros. International Beauty Show (which we casually know as a \u201chair show\u201d\u2014shoutout to Chris Rock\u2019s Good Hair), she dished all things hair and AWIT.\n\nOn from B*A*P*S to AWIT:\n\nI used to do a lot of fantasy hair competitions, and [director] Robert Townsend picked hairstyles I had done before in shows [for B*A*P*S]. [For Wrinkle], I had to be more creative, and I had to really search more on what to do with the hair because I really didn\u2019t have anything to reference other than the book, and these were women from the universe. And what does a woman from the universe look like? There\u2019s no real reference to that, but it was fun creating that. So I wanted something and Ava [also] wanted something that was more avant-garde, but something that was also kind of couture but very fashionable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn creating the looks for each Mrs.:\n\nI had to do a couple of meetings with Ava. That gave me ideas of how far she wanted to go with the look, and basically coming up with the color for each person. We went through, I want to say, 200 tear sheets of just ideas, and then it was very difficult to narrow down which looks, but we had to collaborate with the clothes and makeup. We had to all kind of work together to create the image of what this was going to look like because we didn\u2019t want the hair competing with the clothes, and it needed to be cohesive and go together. It took a while for the clothes to really come together, so we put some ideas out there. Then, once I got to see the clothes, I pulled from the ideas that I thought would work best with the clothes. And then we did camera tests. So we got to actually see the clothes and the hair and the makeup altogether.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Disney\n\nOn Oprah\u2019s Mrs. Which hair and what it means:\n\nTo me, I call her \u201cthe diva of the universe.\u201d Her clothes are metallic. Her hair color was metallic. We blended like platinum, gold and a little bit of bronze ... we custom-made all her hair. She was like, \u201cI don\u2019t want my ordinary color. I want something really different.\u201d Out of all the colors, this one was, to me, the most striking, and it was very soft and beautiful on her. And then, of course, her hair was big and in textures, so we did a lot of curls and big hair. She had like a long braid at one point. So I just look at her like she\u2019s the diva of the universe and her hair is made up of minerals of the earth. That\u2019s why platinum, gold and bronze and those things blended together made up her hair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Mindy Kaling\u2019s Mrs. Who hair:\n\nHer hair color didn\u2019t really change, but what was different about her is that she had a lot of texture going on. She had little braids. Her thing was more cultural. So she was all these different cultures. Like Asian, African, Spanish, Indian; all these different cultures kind of made up Mrs. Who. If you look at her clothes, she\u2019s like a quilt of just everything, and that was sort of the idea behind her image and her look. If you noticed, she had a lot of braided stuff and sculpted hairstyles.\n\nOn Reese Witherspoon\u2019s Mrs. Whatsit hair:\n\nShe was more earthy but, yet, a little fiery. She was a bit more whimsical and kind of quirky, in a way. She\u2019s almost like a flower child with a little fire, I guess. Red was something I thought was very different for Reese. ... We really wanted to create this whole other image. I didn\u2019t want you to look at her and see Reese. I wanted you to look at her and see a different person. The same thing with Oprah and Mindy. You wanted to see, like, a completely different person.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn styling Storm Reid\u2019s natural hair for Meg Murry:\n\nWe did take some things from the book because Ava, you know, she wanted to definitely be able to connect with fans of the book. The character, she had curly hair also. But, also, I thought this was a great way to go because natural hair is such a big thing and it\u2019s such a big statement. I love that women are starting to embrace and understand how to deal with [natural hair] because, for years, we didn\u2019t even know how to deal with natural hair. But her having natural hair, naturally curly hair, is great ...\n\nPhoto: Disney\n\nI think it\u2019s good for young girls to be able to look up to someone and to see this young African-American woman starring in a big film having natural hair. It\u2019s going to be great for young women to identify. Even though I do feel like this newer generation is understanding more about natural hair and embracing it more, it\u2019s great to see that on the big screen. Because for years, you had to have straight hair to be on TV. Natural hair wasn\u2019t accepted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn how AWIT even wowed her:\n\nThere was so much women power on this movie. [You had] Ava directing this big film and you got Mindy, Oprah and Reese. They\u2019re acting in this movie, but Oprah has her own network and she\u2019s got several films she\u2019s produced. Reese produced Big Little Lies and then Mindy producing her own shows. These women are powerhouses. Being able to work around these women, I loved that energy! It was just powerhouses of women throughout the whole project.\n\nThe Glow Up tip: We know you love to support black films, so let\u2019s show Hollywood that they count.

Some great moments deserve a sequel, and we\u2019ve therefore done some deep investigative journalism to get the details on our favorite look of Grammy night 2018.\n\nAs previously posted, Eve was our hands-down winner of this year\u2019s awards ceremony, despite not being nominated this year (sorry, Beyonc\u00e9). Thanks to our intrepid, talented and well-connected Gizmodo Media Group family (we\u2019re talking about you, Victor Amos!), we were able to get the scoop on Eve\u2019s incredible Grammys style\u2014and, most important, how to imitate it.\n\nLet\u2019s start with that gorgeous face: Makeup artist Ernesto Casillas has been working with Eve since the promotional tour for Barbershop and counts her among his favorite clients. For her Grammys look, he rose to the occasion while not even knowing what the star would be wearing, as he tells The Glow Up:\n\nFor the look, I knew right away that I wanted to keep it pretty and somewhat classic. We didn\u2019t know exactly what outfit she was going to wear up until right before she went on, so I wanted to keep the colors neutral and paint her in a way that she would feel confident and pretty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe multihyphenate added \u201cred-carpet host\u201d to her title this year, co-hosting the evening\u2019s Grammy Red Carpet Live with Entertainment Tonight\u2019s Nancy O\u2019Dell, Kevin Frazier and Keltie Knight. To make sure the star stayed stellar-looking throughout the day, Casillas had a strategy:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCasillas also wanted to make sure the focus stayed where it belonged while his star was speaking on the red carpet:\n\nEve usually likes to opt for a nude pink lip, but I knew I wanted a midtone lip, since she was wearing a suit and would be interviewing people. I wanted the mouth to also be a focus, but not too dark, either. I lined the lips with a deep berry color and filled in with a lighter, peachier shade. I used Kat Von D\u2019s \u201cLolita\u201d lipstick and some nude gloss over that.\n\nAnd lest we forget that Eve opted to wear not one, but two d\u00e9colletage-baring blazers during the evening, Casillas certainly didn\u2019t, using Gleam Body Bronzing Lotion in shade Deep Gold on her chest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd as for that mane of perfectly tousled waves Eve was rocking over her shoulder? You can thank hairstylist Angela Christine, who\u2019s been working with Eve for over seven years and also styles her for The Talk. Christine tells The Glow Up:\n\nShe\u2019s an amazing person to work with, [and] really makes the job easy. Eve loves strong and effortless, so once she chose the suit, she wanted something that felt relaxed and beautiful at the same time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that deciding on Eve\u2019s style was effortless; Christine was ready for a big chop, but the star felt otherwise. \u201cWe actually went back and forth about the hair. ... I wanted to do a shorter, edgy cut, but she was serious about keeping it long,\u201d Christine says.\n\nAnd as for that color? Christine says that she and Eve have been playing with both warm and cool tones lately, and the honey tone was actually done well in advance. The extensions actually came from Christine\u2019s own line, Conscious Curls, in a texture called Strength, which closely resembles natural hair blown out. \u201cThis [allowed] for lots of fullness and volume, which we both loved,\u201d Christine says.\n\nChristine then used a medium-barrel ceramic curling iron to achieve those gorgeous loose waves, strategically curling in opposite directions for a messier look. She then used Ouai Rose Oil and Kenra Texturizing Taffy to create even more separation and texture.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChristine\u2014who, in addition to working for The Talk, also has a salon in West Hollywood, Calif., and consults for other beauty brands\u2014is releasing a series of affirming children\u2019s books called the Pretty Curls Club.

Bangash, File (AP Images)\n\nThis may come as a surprise to no one, but [stage whispers] National Geographic (along with many other publications) used to be hella, obviously racist.\n\nShocking. I know.\n\nBut as it turns out, we don\u2019t even need to lash out at Nat Geo for its racist past, as the world-renowned magazine that explores science, geography, history and world culture has decided to come for its own wig and snatch itself bald, the first step to righting a long-overlooked and perhaps even taken-for-granted wrong.\n\nSusan Goldberg, the magazine\u2019s editor-in-chief, and perhaps not so coincidentally the magazine\u2019s first woman and first Jewish person to hold the title, penned an article for the Race Issue explaining how the magazine had invited a leading historian, University of Virginia professor John Edwin Mason, to investigate the magazine\u2019s coverage of people of color in the U.S. and abroad.\n\nGoldberg wrote:\n\nWhat Mason found in short was that until the 1970s National Geographic all but ignored people of color who lived in the United States, rarely acknowledging them beyond laborers or domestic workers. Meanwhile it pictured \u201cnatives\u201d elsewhere as exotics, famously and frequently unclothed, happy hunters, noble savages\u2014every type of clich\u00e9. Unlike magazines such as Life, Mason said, National Geographic did little to push its readers beyond the stereotypes ingrained in white American culture. \u201cAmericans got ideas about the world from Tarzan movies and crude racist caricatures,\u201d he said. \u201cSegregation was the way it was. National Geographic wasn\u2019t teaching as much as reinforcing messages they already received, and doing so in a magazine that had tremendous authority. National Geographic comes into existence at the height of colonialism, and the world was divided into the colonizers and the colonized. That was a color line, and National Geographic was reflecting that view of the world.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThroughout the article, Goldberg links to old articles and also displayed old photographs with the offensive, disparaging and/or racist captions that they carried. There was one referenced article, a 1916 story about Australia, that featured photos of two Aboriginal people. The caption accompanying that photo? \u201cSouth Australian Blackfellows: These savages rank lowest in intelligence of all human beings.\u201d\n\nAnd, as Mason pointed out to Goldberg, it was not just what the magazine included but what it also chose to omit:\n\nMason compared two stories we did about South Africa, one in 1962, the other in 1977. The 1962 story was printed two and a half years after the massacre of 69 black South Africans by police in Sharpeville, many shot in the back as they fled. The brutality of the killings shocked the world. \u201cNational Geographic\u2019s story barely mentions any problems,\u201d Mason said. \u201cThere are no voices of black South Africans. That absence is as important as what is in there. The only black people are doing exotic dances \u2026 servants or workers. It\u2019s bizarre, actually, to consider what the editors, writers and photographers had to consciously not see.\u201d Contrast that with the piece in 1977, in the wake of the U.S. civil rights era: \u201cIt\u2019s not a perfect article, but it acknowledges the oppression,\u201d Mason said. \u201cBlack people are pictured. Opposition leaders are pictured. It\u2019s a very different article.\u201d Fast-forward to a 2015 story about Haiti, when we gave cameras to young Haitians and asked them to document the reality of their world. \u201cThe images by Haitians are really, really important,\u201d Mason said, and would have been \u201cunthinkable\u201d in our past. So would our coverage now of ethnic and religious conflicts, evolving gender norms, the realities of today\u2019s Africa, and much more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBluntly acknowledging its own past in this way is indeed powerful, but it is not necessarily something, I think, that we should applaud, as much as we should expect ... especially at this time in our lives when race and discussions of racism and even general cultural insensitivity can be volatile, tense and perhaps even deadly.\n\nThis is something that National Geographic also readily accepts and acknowledges.\n\nGoldberg writes:\n\nApril 4 marks the 50th anniversary of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. It\u2019s a worthy moment to step back, to take stock of where we are on race. It\u2019s also a conversation that is changing in real time: In two years, for the first time in U.S. history, less than half the children in the nation will be white. So let\u2019s talk about what\u2019s working when it comes to race, and what isn\u2019t. Let\u2019s examine why we continue to segregate along racial lines and how we can build inclusive communities. Let\u2019s confront today\u2019s shameful use of racism as a political strategy and prove we are better than this.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndeed, let us confront the issue at hand, up front.\n\nWho wants to be next in line to drag themselves down the street?", "keywords": ["race", "magazines", "snatches", "past", "south", "racist", "mason", "article", "wig", "magazine", "world", "geographic", "black", "national"], "polarity": 0.04064697609001407, "subjectivity": 0.46653656821378353},

I\u2019d seen her achieve as much in her other films with far less capital behind them than the history-making, $100 million budget that Disney provided this time, so there was no question that this film would be gorgeous.\n\nI was expecting Oprah Winfrey to blow my mind playing Mrs. Which, the wisest being in the universe, dressed as an intergalactic angel with gravity-defying Kim Kimble hair. And I was expecting Storm Reid, the wide-eyed, curly-haired 14-year-old star of the film, to break boundaries of the imagination for other children about what a fantasy-film hero looks like.\n\nBut I was not expecting this film to be retroactively healing for this 32-year-old black woman who grew up feeling shut out of a genre I love.\n\nAt the Los Angeles press screening of the film just days before the world premiere, DuVernay surprised the audience by showing up to introduce it. \u201cLet your inner child watch this movie,\u201d she instructed, and I obeyed.\n\nWithin minutes of Storm\u2019s appearance on-screen with her sweet face, African nose and natural hair, I surprised myself when I started to tear up. Sure, it\u2019s upsetting that her character, Meg Murry, is being bullied by teachers, students and her principal over the mysterious disappearance of her father into another dimension; and yes, the film is rich with inspiring messages of overcoming evil with love and light that tug on every heartstring.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t why, by the end of the film, I was alternating between wiping away full-on tears and letting them fall, uninterrupted. It took a moment for me to understand what was being released in that theater.\n\nIn the mid- to late 1990s, I was a budding child actress growing up in Virginia who\u2019d landed representation with the New York City talent agent famous for discovering Tom Cruise: Toby Gibson. I had filmed my first SAG-AFTRA-qualifying gig as a guest star on the PBS show The Puzzle Place, had two callbacks for the part of Bethany on the ABC drama Second Noah and was thrilled out of my mind to lose the role to the little girl from Crooklyn (Crooklyn!). Things were looking up for my fledgling career. Then my military father was relocated to Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska and everything changed.\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of Brooke Obie\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFolks weren\u2019t checking for young black actresses in Nebraska. Besides a Wow! potato chips commercial that never aired, and an infomercial for a product to protect your computer from the inevitable crash of Y2K (aww, the \u201990s!), all the parts I auditioned for went to children of a whiter hue. So I tried my hand at theater and was accepted into the local children\u2019s company. But even there, I had little success, playing nameless background roles. In one production, they had me playing one of many \u201cNative American children.\u201d I shudder to remember what that entailed.\n\nSo when the company announced that they\u2019d be putting on the play based on one of my favorite books, A Wrinkle in Time, in my 12-year-old mind it was a sign. I couldn\u2019t help but kill an audition for Meg\u2014a bullied middle school kid who didn\u2019t fit in but who gets to fly, gets the guy and gets to be the hero. I read for the part and put into my audition every drop of emotion I\u2019d felt being isolated as the only black girl in a sea of white classmates and teachers every day. Finally! This Midwestern nightmare was going to serve a greater purpose.\n\nNot quite.\n\nWhen they announced the casting of a white girl with brown hair and glasses as Meg\u2014just like in the book\u2014I remember thinking, \u201cOf course.\u201d I was more disappointed in myself that I had even thought I had a chance at the role. Black girls can\u2019t be Meg. Black girls don\u2019t belong here. Not even in fantasy. I wound up playing a part so small that it\u2019s not even listed on the SparkNotes character list online, so I can\u2019t recall it now. I quit acting after that production.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt would take another 14 years before I would begin to challenge the limits that had been put on my imagination as a child, including that experience. By 2016 I\u2019d published my first novel, a reimagining of American history, about a black teen girl who escapes from her enslaver, the first president, and starts a revolution.\n\nWhen agents, editors and publishing houses said they couldn\u2019t imagine an audience wanting to read such a story, I laughed. Their limits were no longer mine; nor were they shared by the readers I\u2019ve met across the country and in the United Kingdom on tour. Book of Addis wound up winning literary awards for fiction. Pushing through those limits and achieving my definition of success with my novel, I thought that meant I was healed.\n\nAnd then I found myself bawling in a Disney theater as Sade sang \u201cFlower of the Universe\u201d at the end credits of A Wrinkle in Time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, black children need to see this film so they can know that they, too, can be heroes. Yes, all children need to see this film\u2014especially boys\u2014so they can know how to follow the lead of a black girl. But I needed to see this film, too.\n\nTwelve-year-old me needed to see beautiful black Storm Reid be Meg and be an outcast and deal with depression and be a hero anyway and travel through space and fly. Twelve-year-old me needed to see Oprah speak life into that little girl\u2019s fear and low self-esteem and say that if she just finds the right frequency, she, too, can fly. Twelve-year-old me needed Ava DuVernay to create the space for all of that #BlackGirlMagic to shine on-screen.\n\nAnd by creating that space, DuVernay wrinkled time, found that little girl in the \u201990s who had been trapped for years in a white void and flung the escape hatch wide open. With one film, she reminded me of the healing power of the imagination, and then she healed a hole in my heart that I didn\u2019t even remember existed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMagic, just as I expected.", "keywords": ["power", "playing", "wrinkle", "retroactive", "film", "little", "white", "healing", "girl", "needed", "children", "black", "expecting"], "polarity": 0.09692197683269113, "subjectivity": 0.49359370787942186},

It was a triumph as epic as the film itself. But Panther isn\u2019t the only black-helmed film being released by Disney this winter; we are now only two weeks away from the release of A Wrinkle in Time, directed by Ava DuVernay.\n\nFeaturing Oprah, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Mindy Kaling, Reese Witherspoon and Chris Pine and starring newcomer Storm Reid as young heroine Meg Murry, A Wrinkle in Time is certain to serve up its own brand of black-girl movie magic on March 9. And along with all of you avid filmgoers, we especially think our girls should be there to see it.\n\nEnter the \u201cA Wrinkle in Time Challenge\u201d (#AWITChallenge): an initiative to buy out eight theaters in cities around the country\u2014Austin, Texas; Charlotte, N.C.; Chicago; Greensboro, N.C.; Houston; Philadelphia; Plainfield, N.J.; and Washington, D.C.\u2014for black girls (and nonboys) to see the film on opening weekend.\n\nCoordinated by the online group Sisters in the Storm, \u201ca collective of black women focused on community engagement and Sisterhood among black women & non-men,\u201d a GoFundMe page has been created with the aim of raising $25,000, reaching nearly half their goal in the past 10 days, with just under a week left to go. But behind their valiant mission is a heartbreaking story, as co-founder Sherronda J. Brown explains in an essay at Medium:\n\nIn late January, a black girl named Stormiyah Denson-Jackson passed away in an apparent suicide at the public boarding school she attended. She was twelve years old and already madly in love with math and science\u2014a #RealMeg. But this love she had made her the target of bullying and verbal abuse from her classmates. Devastated by their taunts, she chose to end her life rather than live with the shame they tried to make her feel for being a \u201cnerd\u201d who enjoyed engaging with sciences and mathematics. There is a narrow image of blackness in the social imagination, mired with stereotypes and white ascendant ideals about black intellect, capability, and mobility. For black women and girls, beliefs, about our blackness\u2014how it is allowed to look, what it is allowed to achieve\u2014can never be divorced from beliefs about our gender. There is a social stigma about challenging these expectations and permissions, and it constantly impacts our experiences in the world, but never more significantly than when we are growing up, learning who we are, and deciding who we want to become.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike the momentum that grew around the #BlackPantherChallenge, raising over $620,000 from all 50 states to make it possible for black children to see themselves reflected on film, Sisters of the Storm\u2019s act of love and generosity is inspiring others to do the same for the #AWITChallenge. For instance, writer and Lemonade Syllabus creator Candice Benbow has set her own goal to make A Wrinkle in Time accessible to 200 girls in Hamilton, N.J. As she told The Glow Up, it\u2019s a gift she hopes to make in memory of her mother:\n\nI wanted to ensure that we do our part to support Ava and this film just like we supported Ryan Coogler and Black Panther. But also, my mom took me to the library every Friday, and would take me to the movies whenever something came out for kids. This movie and the moment around it reminds me of my childhood and time with my mother. I wanted to honor that by participating in this challenge so black girls today can look back on similar memories and smile. What Ava has done with this film made history, and black girls need to see that there is no dream too big for them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe have seen firsthand the impact that seeing black superheroes on film can have on our children\u2014and ourselves. With A Wrinkle in Time, we also have yet another opportunity\u2014and plenty of incentive\u2014to show Hollywood that blockbusters star black people, too.\n\nBut for real-life Meg Murrys, or Shuris, or other struggling Stormiyah Denson-Jacksons, A Wrinkle in Time may also provide exactly the affirmation and inspiration they need to flourish as their brilliant, STEM-loving, \u201cblack girl nerd\u201d selves. As Brown wrote: \u201cSeeing ourselves represented as heroes has undeniable power, and feeling our absence in these roles also influences the way that we see ourselves and our blackness.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s do it again, y\u2019all.\n\nThe Glow Up tip: A Wrinkle in Time opens in theaters on Friday, March 9. You can support Sisters in the Storm\u2019s $25,000 #AWITChallenge via its GoFundMe page until March 1.

I flew toward those words on Lit Cosmetics\u2019 Lit Metals Metallic Pigment Kit liquid metallic eye shadow box like a moth to a flame\u2014especially after learning that this was the same makeup used to create Oprah\u2019s look for her turn as Mrs. Which in the big-screen fantasy A Wrinkle in Time.\n\nThis water-based formulation makes it easy to use with contacts and safe for lash extensions; it\u2019s also paraben-, glycol- and alcohol-free, and its lightweight but easily buildable coverage makes it perfect for everyday wear (if you dare).\n\nApplication is an easy two-step process. First, dip the brush into the liquid adhesive and apply it to your eyelid, allowing about 30-60 seconds to dry. While it\u2019s still wet, dip the same brush into the pot of glitter\u2014which is ground so fine it looks like a powder\u2014and brush the glitter onto your lids.\n\nVoil\u00e0! The effect is instant, and the gold pigment is likely what you\u2019ve been looking for in a dry or cream shadow but could never find.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPersonally, I felt the liquid adhesive drying and tightening a little for about 15 minutes afterward, and was aware of feeling something on my lids for about a half hour before I got used to the feeling. A few tricks: Avoid the crease of your eye\u2014unless you have ample time to sit with your eyes closed, it\u2019s very difficult for the adhesive to dry in the fold in the lid, and it will feel sticky for long time. If it happens, just moisten a cotton swab with water and wipe it away. Also, make sure to comb your lashes out immediately afterward in case a stray sparkle goes rogue and lands in the base of your lashes.\n\nFor a more dimensional look, you can layer the adhesive and Lit Kit glitter over regular eye shadow. Another easy and quick day-to-night makeup transformation is to use the glitter as a liquid eyeliner\u2014it takes five minutes. For golden lids, Addicted is now my go-to color, and I used Smolder for a sleek and shimmering eyeliner. Lit Kits give you glittery glamour for $28.

Blige\u2019s glow up this awards season; in fact, we\u2019re not sure we\u2019ve stanned this hard for her since What\u2019s the 411? The singer and actress has been nominated for Golden Globe, Critics Choice and Screen Actors Guild awards, and now a history-making two Oscar nods for both her performance and original song in Dee Rees\u2019 Mudbound. And she has stunned us on every single red carpet.\n\nBut those stunning looks have a secret weapon in a longtime member of Blige\u2019s team: celebrity makeup artist D\u2019Andre Michael. Knowing how much we wanted the 411 on Blige\u2019s super-fly SAG Awards look, Michael let The Glow Up in on a surprisingly low-priced secret: He exclusively used products from Black Opal.\n\nYes, THAT Black Opal (its Instagram is kind of poppin\u2019, by the way). In Michael\u2019s words:\n\nI\u2019ve been working with Mary J. Blige for years, and I love trying new looks on her. I wanted to create a showstopping look using Black Opal for her first-time appearance at the SAG Awards. Once I saw her gown, I knew I wanted to transform her into an elegant smoked goddess.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe was smokin\u2019 indeed, styled by fashion fave Law Roach in a one-shouldered black-and-white gown with a dramatic wing motif by designer Jean-Louis Sabaji.\n\nMichael, who\u2019s been on Blige\u2019s team for over a decade, complemented her dress and sleek modern hairstyle with a perfect smoky eye atop glowing skin, using Black Opal all the way. He shared with The Glow Up why, after years of working with the superstar, this awards season is such a special one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up: As a longtime member of Mary J. Blige\u2019s team, what\u2019s it like to work with her during this groundbreaking phase of her career?\n\nD\u2019Andre Michael: Having been with Mary J. Blige now for 11 years, we are more like family. I am so proud and honored to be a part of this moment with her. I\u2019m happy and overjoyed with her continued success, but this is like the stepping-stone to something I know she has been passionate [about]. It\u2019s amazing to see the acknowledgment and praise she is receiving for her work as an actress. I\u2019m like a proud brother.\n\nTGU: Mary\u2019s looks have been phenomenal at every event. How are you able to keep her looks so fresh?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDM: I have been with her every step of the way: Every award show, every red carpet, press junket, television show, etc. It\u2019s always been my thing to make her look good every time.\n\nMaybe because she\u2019s on a different platform now, a broader audience is taking note, but nothing has changed much with what we do. It\u2019s being there as a support for her in all that she\u2019s going through personally, making sure her spirits are up and she feels good about herself and comfortable with how she looks, what she\u2019s wearing, etc. So I think what shines through mostly is her \u201chappy\u201d\u2014and when you feel good internally, it shows externally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: You used exclusively Black Opal for Mary\u2019s SAG Awards look. Tell us why we should be checking for drugstore brands, and why Black Opal works so well for our tones?\n\nDM: I have never been one to follow trends or fads, mainly because trends come and go, and fads fade away. However, staying true to myself as an artist and finding things that work for me to use on my clients is most important. That\u2019s above any brand\u2014whether it is department store, drugstore or specialty store.\n\nI have learned just because something has a name brand on it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s suitable for what I need to use it for. Therefore, it is all about the quality of a product, and sometimes the most expensive product isn\u2019t necessarily the best. A lot of my favorite go-to products are drugstore brands.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy friend Sam Fine worked with Black Opal years ago and helped them with their colors and palettes. Even then, I realized It was a brand that I could trust, because he\u2019s an amazing artist that I respect and call a friend. So if Sam trusts them, I know I can.\n\nDM: Black Opal has always been a staple for having a great color range for women of color; from the fairest of women to the darkest, you could trust you are in good hands with the Black Opal brand, and the formula is great. It gives great coverage that you could work with, whether you need a light coverage to a complete coverage. The Black Opal True Color Skin Perfecting Stick Foundation is amazing! It is great to see they are still around and providing women of color and us professionals with great colors and a great formula.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: At 47, Mary looks incredible. Can you talk about how makeup differs for women in her age group?\n\nDM: The only difference is probably the fads and trends you may want to stay away from with a more mature woman. In terms of looks, you definitely want to use less powder and more products that enhance a dewier look.\n\nFor eyes, most to all women can carry a smoky eye. Many think \u201csmoky eye,\u201d and they think black or dark. But you can smoke your eyes with almost any color.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn terms of skin, I like to do my concealer, then apply my foundation, next set with a powder, and maybe spritz your face with a mister or the Evian mist spray to infuse the powder and foundation. Next, let it air-dry to take away the powdered look so you have more of a dewy skin appearance.\n\nIlluminators work as well, but know that sometimes these can come across drab and chalky looking if you use the wrong color. For women of color, I recommend an illuminator in the flesh-tone range (bronzy or mauve, etc.), and stay away from pearl color or yellows or orange-based colors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, even after all that great advice, we couldn\u2019t let Michael go without getting his step-by-step for creating Blige\u2019s SAG look, and all the products he used. How else are we going to plan for our next shopping trip?\n\nFor the Face\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the Eyes\n\nTo sculpt and define Blige\u2019s eyes, Michael used the Black Opal Aurora Eyeshadow Palette. First, he used the Brazen Copper shade on her entire eyelid. Next, he added Brazen Bronze on her crease, adding the Bordeaux Beige shade along the brow bone as a highlight.\n\n\n\nMichael then finished the eye look with Black Opal Color Splurge Automatic Eye Lining Pencil in Licorice, adding it along the lash line and inner lid and smudging to create a smoky look. Note: This eye pencil is formulated with aloe vera and chamomile extracts that help to soothe the delicate eye area as you define it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Lasting Lip\n\nFor the finishing touches to Blige\u2019s look, Michael used Black Opal Lip Color Splurge Stick Lip in Purr, a soft, pale-pink color enriched with emollient butters and vitamins C&E. This lipstick provides a bright, pigment-rich color that provides a smooth, creamy, nondrying finish.\n\nNo word yet on what Blige\u2019s look will be for the 90th Academy Awards on March 4. But even after Michael works his magic, we know the finishing touch will really be Mary J. Blige\u2019s happiness.

I stayed away because I simply couldn\u2019t get over the fact that my perfect Belle, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, a woman so beautiful and charismatic that I imagine little woodland creatures do chores for her simply to be in her presence, was cast as a gotdamn feather duster, while Emma Watson landed the lead role.

In the film, Mbatha-Raw plays Dr. Kate Murry, mother to tween Meg Murry (Storm Reid), who embarks on an epic journey to find her father, Alex, played by Chris Pine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a recent Vogue buzz notes, Mbatha-Raw has been \u201cescaping archetypes and quietly shaping a diverse CV for years.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s given riveting performances on both movie and TV screens, playing the title role in the period biopic Belle; showing off her singing skills as a troubled rock star in Beyond the Lights; and taking a time-traveling turn in the iconic, Emmy Award-winning \u201cSan Junipero\u201d episode of Black Mirror (which seemed to serve as inspiration for Janelle Mon\u00e1e\u2019s latest video, \u201cMake Me Feel\u201d). Mbatha-Raw even manages to be captivating in Netflix\u2019s less-than-stellar recent release, The Cloverfield Paradox.\n\nAnd on the red carpet, Mbatha-Raw\u2019s sartorial growth has been equally impressive. This recent slideshow from Vogue UK tracks Mbatha-Raw\u2019s maturation as she settles into more streamlined, polished shapes with bold colors and textures.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt certainly feels like Mbatha-Raw is coming into her moment, though she\u2019s been patiently building her career for decades, starting, as many Brits do, on the stage.\n\n\u201cAs an actor, you have power over your performance, but no power over the distribution or timetable,\u201d she recently told Refinery 29. \u201cSo it just so happens this is all coming out at the same time. But I guess I should embrace the ride!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMbatha-Raw also talked about the power of seemingly innocuous beauty choices, like how to wear her hair on-screen.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s empowering to play a woman and not have race be the focus,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I will always bring who I am to the story and make sure my ethnicity is celebrated on-screen. I\u2019m not afraid to have those tough conversations with directors about how I represent myself. Hair, for instance, sounds like a superficial conversation. But images remain in our subconscious. So when it comes to representing on-screen, I can use my hair to send the important message to girls everywhere that they can be who they are.\u201d\n\nThe Glow Up tip: British Vogue\u2019s April issue, featuring Mbatha-Raw\u2019s cover and interview, is available on newsstands Friday, March 9.

Wells, who was born a slave in 1862 and went on to become the most famous black woman of her time as a journalist and civil rights activist, never had an obituary in The New York Times. Neither did accomplished authors Sylvia Plath or Charlotte Bront\u00eb, or photographer Diane Arbus. They are among the women highlighted in a new series called \u2018Overlooked\u2019 that will publish obituaries for women who were not singled out for the honor at the time.\n\n\u201cThe first set of obituaries were rolled out March 8 \u2014 International Women\u2019s Day. New York Times national reporter Caitlin Dickerson, who wrote Wells\u2019 obituary, told CBSN\u2019s Elaine Quijano the paper is \u2018acknowledging now that the New York Times was, quite honestly, part of the problem.\u2019\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c \u2018The New York Times is the paper of record \u2014 it always, to a certain extent, reflected the culture of the moment,\u2019 Dickerson said. \u2018When we talk about Ida B. Wells, for example, born in the 1860s, we\u2019re talking about a moment when we, as a general culture, didn\u2019t pay attention to African Americans \u2014 especially African American women.\u2019\n\n\u201cDickerson said \u2018everybody in the building\u2019 was eager to be involved. \u2018I think this is going to be a rolling project,\u2019 Dickerson said.\n\n\u201cThe interest, Dickerson noted, reflects how important the issues of gender and inequality are even in a time of fast-breaking news.

He got the gig after CBS\u2019 Chicago station WBBM demoted longtime anchor Harry Porterfield, removing an African American from the lineup of a station that had little diversity on its weekday newscasts. The Rev. Jesse Jackson and Operation PUSH led a 10-month boycott against WBBM, and Holt was moved from WCBS in New York to take over one of the nightly newscasts in Chicago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c \u2018I got that call and I was 27 years old,\u2019 Holt said. \u2018There was a tremendous amount of pressure.

Bangash, File (AP Images)\n\nThis may come as a surprise to no one, but [stage whispers] National Geographic (along with many other publications) used to be hella, obviously racist.\n\nShocking. I know.\n\nBut as it turns out, we don\u2019t even need to lash out at Nat Geo for its racist past, as the world-renowned magazine that explores science, geography, history and world culture has decided to come for its own wig and snatch itself bald, the first step to righting a long-overlooked and perhaps even taken-for-granted wrong.\n\nSusan Goldberg, the magazine\u2019s editor-in-chief, and perhaps not so coincidentally the magazine\u2019s first woman and first Jewish person to hold the title, penned an article for the Race Issue explaining how the magazine had invited a leading historian, University of Virginia professor John Edwin Mason, to investigate the magazine\u2019s coverage of people of color in the U.S. and abroad.\n\nGoldberg wrote:\n\nWhat Mason found in short was that until the 1970s National Geographic all but ignored people of color who lived in the United States, rarely acknowledging them beyond laborers or domestic workers. Meanwhile it pictured \u201cnatives\u201d elsewhere as exotics, famously and frequently unclothed, happy hunters, noble savages\u2014every type of clich\u00e9. Unlike magazines such as Life, Mason said, National Geographic did little to push its readers beyond the stereotypes ingrained in white American culture. \u201cAmericans got ideas about the world from Tarzan movies and crude racist caricatures,\u201d he said. \u201cSegregation was the way it was. National Geographic wasn\u2019t teaching as much as reinforcing messages they already received, and doing so in a magazine that had tremendous authority. National Geographic comes into existence at the height of colonialism, and the world was divided into the colonizers and the colonized. That was a color line, and National Geographic was reflecting that view of the world.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThroughout the article, Goldberg links to old articles and also displayed old photographs with the offensive, disparaging and/or racist captions that they carried. There was one referenced article, a 1916 story about Australia, that featured photos of two Aboriginal people. The caption accompanying that photo? \u201cSouth Australian Blackfellows: These savages rank lowest in intelligence of all human beings.\u201d\n\nAnd, as Mason pointed out to Goldberg, it was not just what the magazine included but what it also chose to omit:\n\nMason compared two stories we did about South Africa, one in 1962, the other in 1977. The 1962 story was printed two and a half years after the massacre of 69 black South Africans by police in Sharpeville, many shot in the back as they fled. The brutality of the killings shocked the world. \u201cNational Geographic\u2019s story barely mentions any problems,\u201d Mason said. \u201cThere are no voices of black South Africans. That absence is as important as what is in there. The only black people are doing exotic dances \u2026 servants or workers. It\u2019s bizarre, actually, to consider what the editors, writers and photographers had to consciously not see.\u201d Contrast that with the piece in 1977, in the wake of the U.S. civil rights era: \u201cIt\u2019s not a perfect article, but it acknowledges the oppression,\u201d Mason said. \u201cBlack people are pictured. Opposition leaders are pictured. It\u2019s a very different article.\u201d Fast-forward to a 2015 story about Haiti, when we gave cameras to young Haitians and asked them to document the reality of their world. \u201cThe images by Haitians are really, really important,\u201d Mason said, and would have been \u201cunthinkable\u201d in our past. So would our coverage now of ethnic and religious conflicts, evolving gender norms, the realities of today\u2019s Africa, and much more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBluntly acknowledging its own past in this way is indeed powerful, but it is not necessarily something, I think, that we should applaud, as much as we should expect ... especially at this time in our lives when race and discussions of racism and even general cultural insensitivity can be volatile, tense and perhaps even deadly.\n\nThis is something that National Geographic also readily accepts and acknowledges.\n\nGoldberg writes:\n\nApril 4 marks the 50th anniversary of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. It\u2019s a worthy moment to step back, to take stock of where we are on race. It\u2019s also a conversation that is changing in real time: In two years, for the first time in U.S. history, less than half the children in the nation will be white. So let\u2019s talk about what\u2019s working when it comes to race, and what isn\u2019t. Let\u2019s examine why we continue to segregate along racial lines and how we can build inclusive communities. Let\u2019s confront today\u2019s shameful use of racism as a political strategy and prove we are better than this.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndeed, let us confront the issue at hand, up front.\n\nWho wants to be next in line to drag themselves down the street?", "keywords": ["race", "magazines", "snatches", "past", "south", "racist", "mason", "article", "wig", "magazine", "world", "geographic", "black", "national"], "polarity": 0.04064697609001407, "subjectivity": 0.46653656821378353},

Hot on the heels of H&M\u2019s absolutely irresponsible and boycott-inducing use of a black boy to market a sweatshirt proclaiming him the \u201cCoolest Monkey in the Jungle,\u201d Italian beauty brand Wycon Cosmetics decided to up the ante.\n\nThe Milan-based beauty company, which touts over 200,000 Instagram followers, apparently thought it\u2019d be a great idea to name its new line of gel polishes after well-known R&B and hip-hop songs, including \u201cDrop It Like It\u2019s Hot,\u201d \u201cCandy Shop\u201d and \u201cBootylicious.\u201d But the company saved the most provocative for last, with its darkest nail color: a true black named \u201cThick as a Nigga.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYeah. For real, for real.\n\nAccording to writer Declan Eytan for Forbes magazine, the polish name was purportedly inspired by the song \u201cThick Nigga\u201d from artist DBangz\u2014an artist with far less popularity than Wycon, but nevertheless deemed an ideal inspirational choice for the brand.\n\n\n\nOK, sure.\n\nWycon\u2019s indelicate choice understandably\u2014and, likely, expectedly\u2014caused an uproar after a now-deleted Instagram post caught the attention of Afro-Italian entertainer and YouTube personality Loretta Grace, who rightly called out the brand on social media. In response to the torrent of criticism unleashed, the company was at first dismissive, telling one commenter, \u201cThey\u2019re made-up names that are a bit crazy\u201d (ahem, they\u2019re not \u201cmade-up\u201d if you use actual song names). But as outrage mounted, the company offered the type of tepid and tone-deaf response we\u2019ve now become all too accustomed to:\n\nWe\u2019re sorry that this post has triggered these types of reactions: every color from our Gel On collection is inspired, with a cheerful attitude and a pinch of naivety, by famous song titles, many of which derive from the landscape of hip hop . . . Wycon is the brand for everybody #nobodyexcluded is our motto and we didn\u2019t mean to offend anybody!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWycon has since scrubbed all Gel On nail polish names from its website, after undoubtedly getting the attention it wanted\u2014attention we\u2019re admittedly reluctant to add to. But in light of the well-publicized series of similar transgressions by major brands that have preceded this one, we highly doubt that the brand didn\u2019t mean to offend. In fact, we don\u2019t think Wycon cared at all, as evidenced by the response Loretta Grace received from the Italian beauty community, as told to Allure magazine:\n\nMy community was shocked about it . . . But most of the Italian beauty community said that I am exaggerating and that a lot of American rappers and singers like Nicki Minaj and Beyonc\u00e9 say the N* word on their songs so we cannot complain about it. SMDH.\n\nClearly, our shock and awe has become as marketable as our culture (we\u2019d personally love to see the brand get slapped with licensing suits for using those song names). Because in 2018, there is absolutely no excuse for this type of racial insensitivity from a cosmetics brand (or any other), other than a sheer lack of\u2014well, you know. So it\u2019s another day, another insult\u2014and ultimately, we just have one less brand to check for. Because one thing obviously hasn\u2019t hit the Italian beauty market yet, and that\u2019s the importance of the black dollar.

When I checked it out yesterday, it was sitting at roughly 25 million views on YouTube, and as of today, it\u2019s nearing 30 million. I think it\u2019s safe to say that Drake \u201cgot one.\u201d The song is dope on its own, but the video levels shit all the way up.\n\nThe premise is this: The video has a budget of almost a million dollars, so Drake decides to do something meaningful with that budget and gives all of it away to folks in and around Miami. He\u2019s giving out money to folks on the street, at grocery stores, in college. He\u2019s out here buying cars (and hopefully insurance and gas money\u2014them joints weren\u2019t Passats), sending people on shopping sprees and handing literal stacks of cash to folks.\n\nThere are a few ways to look at this video. You can choose to look at it as Drake shamelessly tugging at the heartstrings of anybody watching by using his video to paint himself as a sort of hood superman. Much of the video where he\u2019s not giving away money looks to be shot in various hoods of Miami. For those folks he\u2019s handing money to, maybe he\u2019s just temporarily providing a salve when what they might need is actual help (housing, education, etc.) to get and stay out of whatever their situation is.\n\nTemporary help is just that; it\u2019s not changing lives for real. That\u2019s a more cynical view of the video\u2014that Drake is basically pimping fans he\u2019s likely never going to see again for page views and clicks. Shit, he (presumably) didn\u2019t even give away his own money (though somebody still had to pay for that video, which is not shot on anybody\u2019s iPhone).\n\nOn the other hand\u2014this is where I stand\u2014Drake is doing a good deed. A lot of them, actually. And you never know who needs a good deed in their life. Or who is $20 away from being on the street. Or for whom a simple $100 can change everything, or at the very least their week. Money, for the VAST majority of Americans, is a constant struggle. Help is help, however it comes, whenever it comes. I love to see good things happen to people. I love it.\n\nWhen Oprah gives away shit, I love it and I feel happy for the recipients. When Extreme Makeover: Home Edition aired, I cried with those folks who got new homes and new leases on life because sometimes, just sometimes, you need some good fortune. Or Undercover Boss, where employees who show up every day and anonymously do their job to the best of their ability are finally seen by the very people signing their checks. When one of those employees gets rewarded, it makes me emotional. I really like to see good things happen to people, especially folks who don\u2019t know it\u2019s coming.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI remember being surprised when Prince died by how much he did for people. There were stories all over the place, especially in Minneapolis, of folks who had been beneficiaries of Prince\u2019s big heart. Shit, you\u2019d think Prince literally helped out every single person he came into contact with. When Prince died, people happily came out of the woodwork to talk about how generous and thoughtful he was and how he\u2019d do whatever he could to help. And he did it all anonymously. That\u2019s how I like to live my own life. I help people out when I can and it\u2019s because I realize that when you have, it\u2019s a duty to help out those in need to the best of your ability.\n\nThat\u2019s how I feel about Drake\u2019s video. I honestly don\u2019t care about whose money he gave away or how he got it. I\u2019m just glad he was helping folks who clearly needed it. When he handed those stacks to that young man and his (I assume) mother, and they both broke down crying, I felt like Drake knew that while he was handing out money, he gave them something more valuable. I don\u2019t know how anybody ended up being chosen to receive money, but you could tell after they received something, their days were a little bit better. I was moved to tears several times during the video. And I honestly don\u2019t care if I got pimped for my tears, because that wasn\u2019t fake money he was giving out, and those folks whose lives he touched appreciated it.\n\nWhen people with lots of money and resources realize that they can change folks\u2019 lives with simple gestures (and for rich people, money can be a simple gesture), I gain an appreciation for them because it shows me that they get it. I watched Drake\u2019s video and I felt like Drake \u201cgets it.\u201d He went where he saw a need and alleviated some of it.

Thank God.\n\nYou might recall the rumor mill kicking off last Monday when Queen Bey\u2019s Facebook and Ticketmaster pages revealed a previously unannounced stadium gig: Monday, July 30, at Philadelphia\u2019s Lincoln Financial Field.

First, dip the brush into the liquid adhesive and apply it to your eyelid, allowing about 30-60 seconds to dry. While it\u2019s still wet, dip the same brush into the pot of glitter\u2014which is ground so fine it looks like a powder\u2014and brush the glitter onto your lids.\n\nVoil\u00e0! The effect is instant, and the gold pigment is likely what you\u2019ve been looking for in a dry or cream shadow but could never find.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPersonally, I felt the liquid adhesive drying and tightening a little for about 15 minutes afterward, and was aware of feeling something on my lids for about a half hour before I got used to the feeling. A few tricks: Avoid the crease of your eye\u2014unless you have ample time to sit with your eyes closed, it\u2019s very difficult for the adhesive to dry in the fold in the lid, and it will feel sticky for long time. If it happens, just moisten a cotton swab with water and wipe it away. Also, make sure to comb your lashes out immediately afterward in case a stray sparkle goes rogue and lands in the base of your lashes.\n\nFor a more dimensional look, you can layer the adhesive and Lit Kit glitter over regular eye shadow. Another easy and quick day-to-night makeup transformation is to use the glitter as a liquid eyeliner\u2014it takes five minutes.

Basically I\u2019m learning to give less fucks because fucklessness is a form of self-care for me. But there is (at least) one strain of conversation that annoys me even more now than it has in the past, and the level of annoyance rises each time I see it happening.\n\nIt\u2019s when a black person chides other black people for not having their financial shit together, saying things like, \u201cIf we stopped buying weaves and Jordans and started buying land, we\u2019d be free.\u201d There are myriad reasons that this argument is problematic, offensive, dangerous and even racist, but for the sake of time, I\u2019ll quickly list four:\n\nIt\u2019s a classist attempt to shame lower-income people, as if they don\u2019t deserve a nice pair of sneakers, implying that their financial decisions are the only thing keeping them poor/broke\u2014that they\u2019re only poor/broke because they act like poor/broke people.\n\nIt implies that homeownership is the end-all, be-all to wealth accumulation, when there are numerous resources now suggesting that it may actually be better for your financial well-being to rent.\n\nIt implies that wealth accumulation is the end-all, be-all to any sort of happiness or relevance or even maturity.\n\nIt completely ignores the fact that in order to buy a house in America while you also happen to be a black American, you need to either be extraordinarily perfect or extraordinarily lucky. Or perfect and lucky. And even if you\u2019re one of the special, perfect, lucky niggas, it might not even matter.\n\n\n\nFrom \u201cThe Race-Based Mortgage Penalty\u201d:\n\nAn alarming new study by the Center for Investigative Reporting\u2019s online publication Reveal found that African-Americans and Latinos were far more likely to be denied conventional mortgages than whites even when income, loan size and other factors were taken into account. The study examined 31 million mortgage records and found disturbing evidence in 61 metropolitan areas, including Atlanta, Detroit, Philadelphia, St. Louis and San Antonio. African-Americans faced their worst obstacles in the South \u2014 Mobile, Ala.; Greenville, N.C.; and Gainesville, Fla. \u2014 and Latinos in Iowa City. Black applicants were disproportionately turned away, as compared to whites, in 48 metropolitan areas, Latinos in 25, Asian-Americans in nine and Native Americans in three areas. In Washington, D.C., the study found that all four groups were far more likely to be denied home loans than were whites. In Philadelphia, whites received 10 times as many conventional mortgage loans as African-Americans during 2015 and 2016, even though the two groups reside in the city in roughly equal numbers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhatever,\u201d I can imagine some of y\u2019all thinking. \u201cThis shit only applies to working-class black people. If you have money, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nWell, um ...\n\nUpper-income black people were even more likely to be denied loans, as compared to similarly situated whites, than lower income black people were to their white counterparts. This underscored yet again that African-Americans cannot escape economic discrimination simply by becoming wealthier, especially when financial institutions persist in punishing them for living in majority minority neighborhoods. A destructive bill pending in the Senate would deepen this problem by exempting 85 percent of banks from reporting mortgage data that allows regulators and fair housing groups to ensure that home loans are being issued in a nondiscriminatory way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, financial responsibility is a good thing, and measures taken to work toward that should be encouraged. But there\u2019s a way of doing that without also ridiculing the purchases made by black people who aren\u2019t as fortunate. Because there\u2019s an entire industry\u2014an entire fucking country with an entire 500-year history\u2014standing in the way between us and homeownership and accumulating wealth.

Because not only the pageant world, but the beauty industry as a whole has been making some major progress toward diversity.\n\nGIF\n\nEarly last fall, mega-brand CoverGirl shed its classic \u201cEasy, breezy, beautiful\u201d slogan for a fiercer campaign: \u201cI am what I make up.\u201d The brand also ushered in six new badass ambassadors\u2014including Issa Rae\u2014who bring their new mission of inclusivity front and center. And no current beauty conversation would be complete without mentioning Rihanna\u2019s September launch of Fenty Beauty. The launch shook the beauty community to its core, not only breaking the internet but also dispelling some long-held myths surrounding black women and makeup.\n\nSo why, in this melanin-winning back-to-back, inclusivity-embracing, post-Fenty era, are major brands still launching half-assed, lame attempts at diversity?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast week, Tarte Cosmetics, a popular brand known for its cult favorite Shape Tape concealer, launched the highly anticipated Shape Tape foundation. For weeks, Tarte built up the hype for the release with teaser emails and clickbait posts. So imagine the disappointment when thousands of followers flocked to the site, credit card in hand, ready to purchase, only to discover 13 shades of beige and two shades formulated for \u201cricher skintones.\u201d Swatches pictured online were tweeted and retweeted relentlessly.\n\nThe dragging that ensued on Tarte\u2019s timeline was not only epic but truly entertaining. The company eventually had to disable both its Instagram and Twitter comments in an attempt to silence all the negative publicity. Days after throwing shade at Fenty, rationalizing, doubling down on its stance and ignoring its customer base didn\u2019t work, the brand finally relented by posting a response to the outrage on Popsugar, promising more shades to come in the near future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn interesting post from POPSUGAR Beauty.

Women of color have long been conditioned by makeup brands to be OK with being an afterthought. These manufacturers put little to no effort into the formulation of our shades, or the inclusion of more-diverse models. Instead, we\u2019ve typically been told:\n\n\n\nWomen of color typically don\u2019t invest in luxury makeup brands, meaning those shades don\u2019t sell.\n\n\n\nDeeper shades are more difficult to formulate.\n\n\n\nRicher colors will come out in future launches. We want to see how the product tests in the market first.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd in the past, we\u2019ve accepted these excuses as fact \u2026 until Fenty proved that the rhetoric was wrong:\n\n\n\nWomen of color historically didn\u2019t buy expensive brands because the three shitty shades you offered didn\u2019t match or wear well. As one Twitter user stated, \u201cif you only offer red, red as hell and what the hell, I\u2019m going to opt out.\u201d I can get the same horrible look with drugstore brands. I\u2019ll keep my $40. THANKS.\n\n\n\nIf you can formulate deeper eye shadow, lipstick and bronzer shades, then it stands to reason that foundation shades are not that much different. You employ chemists. Why am I mixing shades in my bathroom to try to get a perfect match? I\u2019m not Walter White.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGIF\n\nWhy should we have to wait for a future launch when the Christian Grey-worthy 50 shades of beige you just released could have been cut in half, and replaced with five to 10 deeper shades with golden, olive and neutral undertones?\n\n\n\nIn the end, it basically all comes down to one thing: SHADE.\n\nUnfortunately, Tarte just so happens to be the company that took the dragging this go-round, but far too many brands continue to operate in this manner. I remember rushing out and purchasing the Laura Mercier Translucent Loose Setting Powder, after hearing dozens of girls rave about how it \u201cdoesn\u2019t add color,\u201d has zero flashback in pictures and sets your makeup to perfection. Lies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe powder is stark white. It not only adds a white cast, but if you\u2019re any darker than Denise Huxtable, it\u2019ll have you looking casket ready, if you\u2019re not careful. That was at least five years ago. The brand JUST came out with ONE chocolate-girl-friendly shade last year.\n\n\n\nWomen of color are no longer being silent about their discontent. The bar has been raised, and your three obligatory WOC-friendly shades\u2014chestnut, mahogany and espresso\u2014are no longer going to cut it. We\u2019re not only vocally speaking out, but we\u2019re also speaking with our dollars. We\u2019re supporting brands that support us, because companies will continue to think it\u2019s OK to underrepresent WOC until we show them otherwise. And we can show them otherwise.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n", "keywords": ["beige", "50", "going", "brand", "fenty", "brands", "launch", "beauty", "excluding", "shades", "color", "tarte", "makeup"], "polarity": 0.05741824031149873, "subjectivity": 0.5061870214679204},

She\u2019s got this undeniable Midas touch, which is why we want her to save America by running for president, but we don\u2019t deserve the precious soul that is Oprah as the leader of the free world. In fact, in order for her to keep her limitless effervescence, it\u2019s best that we keep Momma O away from politics.\n\nWe need the queen to remain in her current position so that she can bring us things like SuperSoul Conversations. This is Oprah\u2019s live event that\u2019s an extension of her three-time Emmy Award-winning series, SuperSoul Sunday, which features conversations between Oprah and top thinkers, authors, visionaries and spiritual leaders, exploring themes and issues including happiness, personal fulfillment, spirituality, conscious living and what it means to be alive in today\u2019s world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBasically, it\u2019s the gospel. And when the gospel came to New York City earlier this month, I had to be in the building. Oprah brought her SuperSoul Conversations to the historic Apollo Theater and sat down for a day of interviews with Jordan Peele, Trevor Noah, Yara Shahidi, Salma Hayek, Stephen Colbert and Lin-Manuel Miranda, and each conversation brought with it inspiration, belly laughs and aha moments.\n\nWhen Oprah walked out onto the stage, she gave the excited audience hope by saying, \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be all right,\u201d regarding how all of us are living in Trump\u2019s America. And then she welcomed her first guest, Oscar nominee Peele. Oprah couldn\u2019t help gushing over him. It was adorable. She physically leaned into his every word, and when she spoke of Rose from Peele\u2019s Get Out, Oprah said, \u201cKill the bitch!\u201d Y\u2019all, Oprah said that!\n\n\n\nShe admitted that she\u2019s not the biggest fan of horror, but Get Out challenged her to change her mind. Peele said, \u201cThe fact that we don\u2019t deal with our fears because they\u2019re so unpleasant doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re gone.\u201d This was an aha moment for Oprah, who then reasoned that watching horror movies in the theater is the safest way to experience your fears. Peele responded by saying that we make personal progress by not turning our backs on our own fears. He added, \u201cThere\u2019s a deficit in black men being allowed to be afraid and to fear.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeele said that he used Get Out as a vehicle for black men to explore their fear. That was such a dope conversation to witness. And it ended with Oprah letting Peele know that she\u2019d reach out to former President Barack Obama to find out what he thought of Get Out.\n\nThe good word kept coming through conversations with the brilliant Shahidi, of whom Oprah is also an extreme fan. If you\u2019ve ever heard the young woman speak, you\u2019ll know that she\u2019s basically a genius, spouting off knowledge about the world, activism, art, politics and more. Shahidi\u2019s conversation with Oprah centered on being part of a generation of changemakers, on how she\u2019s fascinated by civil rights and on her bright future. \u201cI\u2019m here to shift the perception of what\u2019s deemed possible,\u201d Shahidi said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo which Oprah replied, \u201cBaby, your future is so bright, it burns my eyes.\u201d\n\nAnd as the day went on, Oprah talked to our faves about a range of topics. With Miranda, Oprah talked about people of color having to work twice as hard for half the payoff; she marveled at Miranda\u2019s passion for giving back, especially to the people (his people) of Puerto Rico. She reminisced with Noah about growing up in poverty, and they bonded over their use of outhouses.\n\nHayek opened up about speaking out against sexual assault and said that Harvey Weinstein harassed her for over five years and said to her, \u201cI am going to kill you.\u201d She didn\u2019t write it in the New York Times article, but Weinstein allegedly told her, \u201cI am going to break the kneecaps of that cunt.\u201d The crowd was noticeably uncomfortable for Hayek.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Oprah has that magic, where she\u2019s able to dig out the biggest truth you\u2019ve never revealed and makes the space for you to share it for your own healing. It\u2019s beautiful to watch, but what are even more beautiful are the life gems you gain from her conversations.\n\nSo do yourself a favor, watch Oprah at the Apollo on OWN on Feb. 27 at 10 p.m. ET to see conversations with Jordan Peele, Salma Hayek and Trevor Noah and Tuesday, march 6 at 10 p.m. ET for Stephen Colbert, Lin-Manuel Miranda and Yara Shahidi.\n\nAnd if you don\u2019t have OWN, what are you doing? No, I\u2019m kidding. You can also listen on Oprah\u2019s SuperSoul Conversations podcast. Now go forth and live your best life!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: The best part was making my way into the official after party, which ended up being super intimate and Oprah literally greeted everyone there individually. And I got to take this picture with her.\n\n", "keywords": ["brought", "harlems", "shes", "fears", "conversations", "dont", "shahidi", "aligned", "oprah", "peele", "noah", "supersoul", "miranda", "chakras", "apollo"], "polarity": 0.2450367732625797, "subjectivity": 0.5730760950519015},

Blige at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles\u2014Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z accidentally teased a joint tour. Bey\u2019s Facebook and Ticketmaster pages revealed a concert date for a previously unannounced stadium stint: Monday, July 30, at Philadelphia\u2019s Lincoln Financial Field. Press caught it, her team deleted it and we never thought about it again ... until Tuesday, when two anonymous sources confirmed to Billboard that the tour is definitely real, but Bey can\u2019t talk about it because of Coachella.\n\nHmmm.\n\n\n\nOne of the aforementioned two sources told the pub, and I quote, \u201cA hold for the tour had been placed at a number of North American stadiums.\u201d This is exciting, to say the least: The last time a Jay-Bey tour happened was in 2014, their infamous On the Run Tour. It\u2019s been two new albums (J\u2019s 4:44 and B\u2019s Lemonade) and four years since, and I\u2019m hungry for more, goddamn it.\n\nSo why can\u2019t Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z spit out the good news and ease our troubled minds? Coachella might really be to blame\u2014Bey is headlining the festival this year, performing on Saturday night both weekends of the Indio, Calif., event: April 14 and 21.\n\nHistorically, Coachella\u2019s parent company, Goldenvoice, has required its big talent to hold off on any tour announcements until after the event, which makes sense: If I\u2019m only trying to see Bey and a few other acts, it\u2019s much, much, much cheaper to wait until she comes near me, and I get to avoid Coachella, which seems unbearable. Win-win, y\u2019all.\n\nIf she (and her husband, lest we forget) waited until the Monday following the end of Coachella, April 22, as Billboard points out, they\u2019d still have 98 days to announce, sell tickets and market the Philadelphia show. That\u2019s a lot less lead time than other tours of this size, but they could be prepping for it right this very second, so who knows?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHonestly, they probably don\u2019t need to make the same preparations as other artists, so let \u2019em do whatever they want\u2014as long as we get the tour.

In 1999 she developed designer Giorgio Armani\u2019s makeup line\u2014in my opinion, still one of the top three foundation formulations and shade ranges on the market. In 2004 she was named creative director of Procter & Gamble cosmetics, which includes lines like SK-II, Dolce & Gabbana and CoverGirl. In 2013 Queen Elizabeth II named McGrath an MBE, or Member of the Order of the British Empire, for services to the fashion and beauty industries.\n\nMcGrath finally founded her own eponymous collection in 2015 based around highly pigmented lipsticks and eye shadows. Without fail, lines around the block accompany each new limited edition launch at her freestanding New York City store, and within hours, her website sells out of her flawlessly curated $125 eye shadow palettes and $38 lipsticks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI worked with McGrath and her team a month ago for the British Fashion Awards and still missed my chance to score the last two offerings of her Matte Trance lipstick and new Lip Fetish lip balm.

So here\u2019s my advice on how to get yours: Log on to Sephora.com at 12 p.m. EST on Jan. 18; on Jan. 19, you can head to select Sephora stores. McGrath has timed the release of these shades so that her fans can use the same makeup she\u2019ll be using during February\u2019s Milan Fashion Week.

Bangash, File (AP Images)\n\nThis may come as a surprise to no one, but [stage whispers] National Geographic (along with many other publications) used to be hella, obviously racist.\n\nShocking. I know.\n\nBut as it turns out, we don\u2019t even need to lash out at Nat Geo for its racist past, as the world-renowned magazine that explores science, geography, history and world culture has decided to come for its own wig and snatch itself bald, the first step to righting a long-overlooked and perhaps even taken-for-granted wrong.\n\nSusan Goldberg, the magazine\u2019s editor-in-chief, and perhaps not so coincidentally the magazine\u2019s first woman and first Jewish person to hold the title, penned an article for the Race Issue explaining how the magazine had invited a leading historian, University of Virginia professor John Edwin Mason, to investigate the magazine\u2019s coverage of people of color in the U.S. and abroad.\n\nGoldberg wrote:\n\nWhat Mason found in short was that until the 1970s National Geographic all but ignored people of color who lived in the United States, rarely acknowledging them beyond laborers or domestic workers. Meanwhile it pictured \u201cnatives\u201d elsewhere as exotics, famously and frequently unclothed, happy hunters, noble savages\u2014every type of clich\u00e9. Unlike magazines such as Life, Mason said, National Geographic did little to push its readers beyond the stereotypes ingrained in white American culture. \u201cAmericans got ideas about the world from Tarzan movies and crude racist caricatures,\u201d he said. \u201cSegregation was the way it was. National Geographic wasn\u2019t teaching as much as reinforcing messages they already received, and doing so in a magazine that had tremendous authority. National Geographic comes into existence at the height of colonialism, and the world was divided into the colonizers and the colonized. That was a color line, and National Geographic was reflecting that view of the world.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThroughout the article, Goldberg links to old articles and also displayed old photographs with the offensive, disparaging and/or racist captions that they carried. There was one referenced article, a 1916 story about Australia, that featured photos of two Aboriginal people. The caption accompanying that photo? \u201cSouth Australian Blackfellows: These savages rank lowest in intelligence of all human beings.\u201d\n\nAnd, as Mason pointed out to Goldberg, it was not just what the magazine included but what it also chose to omit:\n\nMason compared two stories we did about South Africa, one in 1962, the other in 1977. The 1962 story was printed two and a half years after the massacre of 69 black South Africans by police in Sharpeville, many shot in the back as they fled. The brutality of the killings shocked the world. \u201cNational Geographic\u2019s story barely mentions any problems,\u201d Mason said. \u201cThere are no voices of black South Africans. That absence is as important as what is in there. The only black people are doing exotic dances \u2026 servants or workers. It\u2019s bizarre, actually, to consider what the editors, writers and photographers had to consciously not see.\u201d Contrast that with the piece in 1977, in the wake of the U.S. civil rights era: \u201cIt\u2019s not a perfect article, but it acknowledges the oppression,\u201d Mason said. \u201cBlack people are pictured. Opposition leaders are pictured. It\u2019s a very different article.\u201d Fast-forward to a 2015 story about Haiti, when we gave cameras to young Haitians and asked them to document the reality of their world. \u201cThe images by Haitians are really, really important,\u201d Mason said, and would have been \u201cunthinkable\u201d in our past. So would our coverage now of ethnic and religious conflicts, evolving gender norms, the realities of today\u2019s Africa, and much more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBluntly acknowledging its own past in this way is indeed powerful, but it is not necessarily something, I think, that we should applaud, as much as we should expect ... especially at this time in our lives when race and discussions of racism and even general cultural insensitivity can be volatile, tense and perhaps even deadly.\n\nThis is something that National Geographic also readily accepts and acknowledges.\n\nGoldberg writes:\n\nApril 4 marks the 50th anniversary of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. It\u2019s a worthy moment to step back, to take stock of where we are on race. It\u2019s also a conversation that is changing in real time: In two years, for the first time in U.S. history, less than half the children in the nation will be white. So let\u2019s talk about what\u2019s working when it comes to race, and what isn\u2019t. Let\u2019s examine why we continue to segregate along racial lines and how we can build inclusive communities. Let\u2019s confront today\u2019s shameful use of racism as a political strategy and prove we are better than this.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndeed, let us confront the issue at hand, up front.\n\nWho wants to be next in line to drag themselves down the street?", "keywords": ["race", "magazines", "snatches", "past", "south", "racist", "mason", "article", "wig", "magazine", "world", "geographic", "black", "national"], "polarity": 0.04064697609001407, "subjectivity": 0.46653656821378353},

She was describing Bennett\u2019s participation in a documentary about the story of black people in Chicago, where he lived for 35 years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHis 1963 seminal work, Before the MayFlower, traces Black history from its origins in Western Africa through the trans-Atlantic sojourn that would be slavery, the Reconstruction, and the upheavals of the Civil Rights Movement,\u201d Pearson-McNeil continued. A 2008 exhibit about Bennett at Chicago\u2019s DuSable Museum of African American History called him \u201cthe people\u2019s historian.\u201d\n\nJoy Bennett noted the significance of the timing of her father\u2019s passing. \u201cDad would die on Valentine\u2019s Day in the heart of Black History Month. He even went out as a historian,\u201d she said by telephone.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack History Month began as Negro History Week, commemorating Abraham Lincoln\u2019s birthday, Feb. 12, and Feb. 14, which Frederick Douglass celebrated as his day of birth.\n\nOne of Bennett\u2019s most controversial books cast Lincoln in less than a glowing light.\n\n\u201cThe real Lincoln, the author says, was a conservative politician who said repeatedly that he believed in White supremacy,\u201d according to the dust jacket of \u201cForced Into Glory: Abraham Lincoln\u2019s White Dream,\u201d published in 2000.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNot only that: He opposed the basic principle of the Emancipation Proclamation until his death and was literally forced \u2014 Count Adam Gurowski said he was literally whipped \u2014into the glory of having issued the Emancipation Proclamation,\u201d which Lincoln drafted in such a way that it did not in and of itself free a single slave.\u201d\n\n\u201cForced into Glory\u201d won the 2002 American Book Award.\n\nBennett also co-wrote 1989's \u201cSucceeding Against the Odds: The Inspiring Autobiography of One of America\u2019s Wealthiest Entrepreneurs,\u201d the story of John H. Johnson, co-founder of Johnson Publishing Co., publishers of Ebony and Jet magazines.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe helped create the foundations of this [African American] struggle in the forties and fifties when the ground was hard and there were few laborers,\u201d Johnson wrote in the book. \u201c. . . we anticipated the changes and gave focus and form to them. In 1959, for example, I detected a growing interest in Black history and authorized a pathfinding Black history series. The response was so enthusiastic that we published a book, Lerone Bennett\u2019s Before the Mayflower, which became one of the most widely read Black History books ever. This marked the beginning of the Johnson Publishing Company Book Division. . . .\u201d\n\nDespite Bennett\u2019s passion for writing history for the average person, he wanted journalists to be generalists. \u201cI\u2019ve always believed that you write history one day and you write entertainment the next,\u201d he said in \u201cWriting for a Black Publication,\u201d (video) a 2010 interview with the Visionary Project.\n\nThus, his Ebony would feature such purported people-pleasers as \u201cIs It True What They Say About Twins?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBennett\u2019s association with Ebony, which he helped make the nation\u2019s leading African American publication, ended in 2009 when the publication forced his daughter Joy from the editorial staff. Her father demanded that his name be removed from the masthead, where Bennett was listed as executive editor emeritus.

The fashion world\u2019s first black female megastar makeup artist is both a consummate artist and the creative genius and businesswoman behind Pat McGrath Labs. Vogue has called her \u201cthe most influential makeup artist in the world,\u201d and there\u2019s not a face that has graced its covers that she hasn\u2019t made blossom with her particular brand of magic\u2014as demonstrated on beauties like Naomi Campbell, Joan Smalls, Duckie Thot and Oprah Winfrey.\n\nBoth Fortune 500 companies and fans from Moscow to Rio de Janeiro clamor for McGrath\u2019s services for fashion shoots and product-development consultations. In 1999 she developed designer Giorgio Armani\u2019s makeup line\u2014in my opinion, still one of the top three foundation formulations and shade ranges on the market. In 2004 she was named creative director of Procter & Gamble cosmetics, which includes lines like SK-II, Dolce & Gabbana and CoverGirl. In 2013 Queen Elizabeth II named McGrath an MBE, or Member of the Order of the British Empire, for services to the fashion and beauty industries.\n\nMcGrath finally founded her own eponymous collection in 2015 based around highly pigmented lipsticks and eye shadows. Without fail, lines around the block accompany each new limited edition launch at her freestanding New York City store, and within hours, her website sells out of her flawlessly curated $125 eye shadow palettes and $38 lipsticks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI worked with McGrath and her team a month ago for the British Fashion Awards and still missed my chance to score the last two offerings of her Matte Trance lipstick and new Lip Fetish lip balm. But my hope is that these lipsticks will make their way into a Sephora near me sometime soon because thankfully, McGrath has heard our cries for more, making a 61-piece \u201cUnlimited\u201d collection available at the beauty retailer last October.

So here\u2019s my advice on how to get yours: Log on to Sephora.com at 12 p.m. EST on Jan. 18; on Jan. 19, you can head to select Sephora stores. McGrath has timed the release of these shades so that her fans can use the same makeup she\u2019ll be using during February\u2019s Milan Fashion Week.

I want to do this thing,\u201d you don\u2019t say, \u201cNo, Oprah, you cannot do this thing you want to do.\u201d Even if you happen to be making Oprah an omelet for some reason, and she says she\u2019d like feta cheese, peanut butter and Frosted Flakes on said omelet, you don\u2019t say, \u201cNo, Oprah. That would be terrible idea.\u201d Because Oprah would make it work. And then have you ordering and eating cereal omelets.\n\nAnyway, Donald Trump\u2019s recent tweets, in which he called Oprah \u201cinsecure\u201d and challenged her to run against him, might either be the smartest or the dumbest thing he\u2019s done in office.\n\nIt\u2019s obvious why it would be the dumbest: Oprah would kick his ass. Now, whether she\u2019d actually be a good president\u2014and whether we\u2019d actually want someone we love to be in that terrible position again\u2014is debatable. But she\u2019d beat the bone spurs out of that motherfucker. I\u2019d say she\u2019d beat him to the white meat, but I think that once you break Trump\u2019s skin, Tang spills out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, how, you ask, could this have possibly been a \u201csmart\u201d strategy? Well, if Oprah has no intentions of running (AND SHE ALLEGEDLY DOESN\u2019T), he\u2019s challenging someone he knows isn\u2019t interested in running against him. Like a little brother pushing his big brother, knowing that the big brother (probably) won\u2019t hit him back. Although this is a bitch-ass dog whistle to his base, it does communicate a fearlessness, which they\u2019ll drink up like \u201cMAGA\u201d-flavored Mountain Dew.\n\nBut this \u201cshow of strength\u201d only matters if he doesn\u2019t get mollywhopped in 2020 by a black woman from Chicago who\u2019s better, smarter and richer than he is.

Of course you are! The current administration\u2019s steady commitment to incompetence, corruption and white nationalists has gotten the American people, especially African Americans, riled up in ways not seen since Chaka Khan performed at the Republican National Convention (yes, that happened). We at The Root really feel for you, and offer a solution to your pain: our new ongoing series, On the Run: 2017 Campaign Edition.\n\n\n\nSeveral times a month, we\u2019ll be taking you on a tour throughout the U.S., focusing on African-American candidates running for local office, the statehouse and Senate, mayor or governor ... in other words, the people who have just as much to do with your health care and security as the golf-playing, TV-watching retiree in the White House. These are local races where you can volunteer, give money, support and vent your Donald Trump-induced frustrations at the ballot box this fall. We also want you to participate in the process; this is an ongoing interactive story, so if you\u2019re running for local office or know someone who is, tweet us here or here and we may reach out to you.\n\n\n\nOur first feature takes us to Virginia, which, according to the state\u2019s motto, \u201cis for lovers\u201d (of all kinds, legally). Justin Fairfax is a 38-year-old attorney and graduate of Duke University running for the Democratic nomination June 13 to be lieutenant governor of Virginia. He is currently leading in some straw polls, and if successful this fall, he would be one of only a handful of African Americans ever to serve as lieutenant governor in the United States, not to mention the only African American to hold statewide office in Virginia this year. We talked to Fairfax about his upbringing, his view on politics and why he just can\u2019t stay loyal to one major league team.\n\nThe Root: Justin, I think you were made in a lab by Democratic scientists looking to make the perfect black candidate for the DMV (Washington, D.C., Maryland, Virginia metro area). You come from the Midwest (Pittsburgh), but you grew up in Northeast D.C. during the worst part of the crack epidemic in the late \u201980s and \u201990s. You were raised by a single mom who managed to send four kids to college, and you graduated from Duke undergrad, then Columbia Law School. And your last name is Fairfax, which just happens to be the most populous and diverse county in the state. How do we know you\u2019re for real?!\n\nJustin Fairfax: [Laughter.] Well, I\u2019m real. [Laughter.] I mean, my motivation for running for office is to pay back a spiritual debt. Growing up, we didn\u2019t have a lot of money. People gave us hope and faith and optimism and a high-quality education. No matter how dark things seemed, that spiritual wealth kept us going. I have a spiritual debt to pay to all those people\u2014my mom, grandparents, neighbors\u2014who poured so much into me. I have to make that story possible for other people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: You grew up in Northeast D.C., which used to be a poor and working-class black neighborhood. Now almost nobody can afford to live there. The same thing is happening in Northern Virginia, where the Great Recession and the housing crisis wiped out so much black wealth that almost nobody can afford to buy Grandma\u2019s old row house and flip it for a million dollars. What is your stance on gentrification?\n\nJF: It is a huge challenge, and one thing that I\u2019m passionate about. My mom saved up enough money to buy the house across the street from my grandparents, and she still lives there today in Northeast D.C. These homes are going to sell; they sell for a huge profit, and that can increase the intergenerational wealth people have.\n\nFor 90 percent of American families, a home is the largest investment they\u2019re ever going to make. You only have so many chances to change the trajectory of your family. One of the things that inspired me to run for attorney general four years ago was I saw the housing crisis. I\u2019m passionate about protecting homeowners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: What do you think of the Republican House\u2019s new revision of the Affordable Care Act? What can you do in Virginia to assure millions that they won\u2019t lose their health care?\n\nJF: I think this bill is a complete moral travesty and reckless fiscal policy. Utah, Kentucky, Ohio\u2014red states have expanded Medicaid, but we can\u2019t. Until we get our districts to reflect our voters, we\u2019re gonna be stuck, and we\u2019re not gonna be able to do the things we need to do.\n\nJust to reflect on the gerrymandering thing and policy, all five of Virginia\u2019s statewide officeholders are Democrats. Democrats have won Virginia in the last three presidential elections. Yet in the House of Delegates, 66 out of 100 members are Republican. That\u2019s a supermajority. In our congressional delegation, 7 out of 11 members of Congress are Republican. All this shows you the power gerrymandering can have on policy. As lieutenant governor, I want to fight for nonpartisan redistricting; it might be one of the most important issues of our time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: You live in Virginia, you grew up in D.C., but came from Pittsburgh. Who\u2019s your team?\n\nJF: [Laughter.] Basketball team is certainly the Wizards. Since I went to Duke, Jordan is the only Tarheel I like, plus we have the same birthday. I\u2019m existentially torn between the Caps and the Penguins.\n\nTR: What is your position on the racist name of Washington\u2019s football team?\n\nJF: Speaking personally, I personally don\u2019t like the name. But I think we need to keep things in perspective. I think we\u2019re often diverted by issues like this\u2014but I don\u2019t want that to take away from existential threats to our community: health care, criminal justice, mass incarceration. I want to stay laser-focused on people having economic opportunity. With that said, if I owned the team, I\u2019d change the name.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: Last question: What\u2019s on your phone? What are you listening to right now; what are you watching ?\n\nJF: My favorite song right now is from the musical Hamilton. It\u2019s called \u201cMy Shot,\u201d and that\u2019s our campaign theme. We don\u2019t want people to give away their shot on June 13. I haven\u2019t had much time for TV lately; I\u2019ve spent over 35,000 miles in a car, but I read a lot. I\u2019m usually reading multiple books at once. On my reading list right now is The Warmth of Other Suns, The New Jim Crow, True Compass by Ted Kennedy and Team of Rivals.\n\nTR: Are you serious? That\u2019s like a college syllabus in political science. You really were made in a lab!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJF: [Laughter.] I\u2019m almost done. My favorite is When Hell Froze Over; it\u2019s about Doug Wilder\u2019s 1985 run for lieutenant governor of Virginia [Doug Wilder was the first African-American governor since Reconstruction], and A Reason to Believe by Deval Patrick [who was only the second African American to be elected governor in the United States].\n\nTR: Any last words for our readers, and potential voters, out there ?\n\nJF: We\u2019re the first major election since Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration. In 2017, Virginia is going to be the place that sparks a progressive wildfire that spreads across the country.

Their lipsticks are customer faves, but their metallic eye shadows? Glory. Like draping shimmering velvet across your lids. The color array is extensive, but a few standouts are Blue Magic, Downtown, Glamour and Forbidden. And at $6.99 each, you don\u2019t have to choose; save your splurge for one of their customizable palettes!\n\nDanessa Myricks Beauty is one of the most slept-on makeup lines around (seriously, get into it), and her metal game is absolutely magical. Check out her microfine metallic powders and glitters and her ColorFix cream colors, which come in a range of saturated pigments. Want more subtlety? Try her Illuminating Veil and Enlight powders.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFenty Beauty, Killawatt in Trophy Wife. I mean, obvi. This universally flattering multipurpose highlighter flew off the shelves this fall, along with most of RiRi\u2019s foundation line. But too many of us are saving it for beauty tutorials and special occasions, when it also makes an excellent eye shadow and lip powder (Metal Moon too, y\u2019all)! Hesitant to experiment? Just ask yourself: What would Rihanna do?\n\nPat McGrath has been at the top of her game for decades, elevating makeup to an entirely new level of artistry. In addition to designing and consulting on cosmetics lines like Armani Beauty and CoverGirl, her eponymous line is the stuff that makeup junkies dream of, and never lasts long (though she recently blessed us with a permanent line at Sephora). Her Mothership palettes are out of this world, but currently on deck? Her Metalmorphosis kits, which include both cream and pigment finishes and will make you feel like precious metal.\n\nPrefer to focus on your #LipGame?

Known for her coverage of hacker culture, gamers and the Anonymous movement, Norton has written for some of the most popular news outlets, including The Guardian and Wired magazine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSavvy Twitter users immediately noticed a history of problematic tweets by the Times\u2019 new hire, including her boasting about how she was friends with neo-Nazis, calling people \u201cfags,\u201d and repeatedly using the n-word (with the hard \u201cr\u201d).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNorton, who considers herself a \u201cqueer activist,\u201d defended herself by explaining that she only uses racial and homophobic slurs when she\u2019s talking to racists and homophobes, explaining: \u201c ... when I speak to communities, I used their language to do it.\u201d\n\n\n\nBy 10 p.m. Tuesday, she was fired.\n\nTo be clear, not many people think Quinn Norton is a racist or a homophobe. She is just guilty of the omnipresent white privilege of believing that everything that exists belongs to her, including words used to denigrate marginalized minorities. She\u2019s no different from sorority girls at the University of Alabama, Piers Morgan and people in The Root\u2019s inbox who possess an unquenchable desire to know why they can\u2019t say the n-word but Kanye can.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApparently, Norton finds it impossible to discuss inequality without using the reductive language of white supremacy because ... why not? She\u2019s using it for good. The best way to explain her predicament is to boil it down to its most basic, elemental conclusion: Quinn Norton isn\u2019t racist ...\n\nShe\u2019s just white.\n\nWhiteness is a rare ailment that infects the brain and convinces sufferers that they can make themselves exempt from their racist and homophobic actions by simply stating, \u201cI\u2019m not like that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhiteness is so overwhelmingly toxic that it can actually persuade the melaninless (try saying that three times) that they don\u2019t have to delete the evidence of their caucasity because they are excused from criticism. Perhaps the worst part of whiteness is this:\n\nThey are usually right.\n\nAlthough I hate participating in the popular game of \u201cIf They Were Black,\u201d there is no doubt that a black person with a history of making similar statements would never have been hired by the New York Times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be a black writer for the New York Times would mean that that person was not only one of the top writers in his or her field, but had sidestepped every other ancillary pothole that would have sidelined their career.\n\nBut whiteness affords people like Norton the opportunity to erase their previous mistakes. That\u2019s essentially what white privilege is: an invisible, renewable mulligan.\n\nIf you look at the pasts of our last five white presidents, you\u2019ll find a twice-married actor, his vice president, a serial adulterer, a draft-dodging C student and a thrice-married, sexual assaulting racist. The black one? His past was so scandal-free that they had to create some bullshit about his birth certificate and his pastor. That\u2019s it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Quinn Norton is the real victim here. She is so unfamiliar with being responsible for her actions that she saw no need to even try to obscure and apologize for her past. She lives in a world where she is wholly unfamiliar with accountability.\n\nBut here is the most fantastically significant thing about this entire scandal and what it reveals about the New York Times, whiteness and America in general:\n\nSomeone thought the world needed to know Quinn Norton\u2019s opinions.", "keywords": ["york", "times", "shes", "fires", "whiteness", "white", "racist", "reporter", "nword", "quinn", "norton", "black", "using", "hires"], "polarity": 0.04360715449425125, "subjectivity": 0.4871017199646231},

But what happens when Oprah calls? The Glow Up asked writer Tayari Jones, who got the call from the great and powerful O in October when her latest novel, An American Marriage, was chosen as the first Oprah\u2019s Book Club selection of 2018.\n\n\n\nSo what does Oprah say when she calls to give someone life-changing news?\n\n\u201cShe says, \u2018Hi, this is Oprah.\u2019 That\u2019s what she says,\u201d Jones said, laughing. \u201cAnd then she politely waits for you to get your whole freakout on. She patiently waits and then, when she\u2019s decided that\u2019s enough freakout time, she gets on to business.\u201d\n\nThat \u201cbusiness\u201d is a major breakthrough for Jones, whose first novel, Leaving Atlanta, won the 2003 Hurston/Wright Legacy Award for Debut Fiction. Crafting An American Marriage, which debuted last week to critical acclaim, was a slow and arduous journey, spanning six of the seven years since her last (also critically acclaimed) novel, Silver Sparrow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI thought I couldn\u2019t work this book out,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI thought I\u2019d chosen a project that was too emotionally and morally ambitious, and I couldn\u2019t work it out.\u201d\n\nHer journey began with a desire to engage more of the issues of the day in her writing\u2014specifically issues surrounding wrongful incarceration, which she researched extensively during a fellowship at the Radcliffe Institute at Harvard in 2011. But though she became informed, she says she didn\u2019t feel inspired:\n\n\n\nIt didn\u2019t spark me as an artist, and I think it\u2019s because when it comes to issues like wrongful incarceration, there\u2019s only one side to that story. There\u2019s no other side to it; it\u2019s just wrong. And something with only one side, to me, is not dynamic enough to support 300 pages of a novel; you need ambiguity, you need adventure, you need\u2014just so many things\u2014but I didn\u2019t have any of those things.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut inspiration often comes in unlikely places. For Jones, it arrived in a mall food court in her native Atlanta when she overheard a couple arguing at a nearby table. Jones took note of the physical differences between the two\u2014the woman was very well put-together, clearly doing better than the man with whom she was engaged in a heart-wrenching discussion within earshot of Jones:\n\nShe said, \u201cRoy, you know you wouldn\u2019t have waited on me for seven years.\u201d And he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what you talkin\u2019 about; this shit wouldn\u2019t have happened to you in the first place\u201d... and I thought, that is really, in many ways, the heart of the African-American man-woman disconnect. He needs from her this kind of unconditional support, and she doesn\u2019t believe that if the tables were turned that he would behave the same way. And he feels like, \u201cThese tables don\u2019t turn, so it\u2019s moot!\u201d And I just felt like both of them deserved a full story, and that\u2019s how I started.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat that overheard conversation inspired is a beautiful and sometimes brutally honest novel about love, loss, hope, redemption, the secrets we keep from those we claim to love, and what Jones feels is the fundamental disconnect and danger facing black heterosexual relationships in a country so deeply invested in both racism and the prison-industrial complex\u2014and, consequently, the effects of wrongful incarceration on relationships, as Jones explained to The Glow Up: \u201cI\u2019m really curious about the residual effects; about what we owe one another; about the way this affects gender dynamics in our community.\u201d\n\nThe title of An American Marriage refers to the union of Roy and Celestial, an upwardly mobile African-American couple whose young marriage is ripped apart by wrongful incarceration\u2014a misidentification that Roy pays for with years of his innocent life.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat ensues during those years confronts the reader\u2019s most deeply held beliefs about fidelity, obligation and, most important, love. It also addresses the paradox that can be created when the deep inequities in our justice system intersect with the double standards that often permeate our relationships.\n\nOriginally writing from Celestial\u2019s point of view as a prisoner\u2019s wife, Jones found that her character\u2019s choices and behavior didn\u2019t meet early readers\u2019 expectations. \u201cEveryone [was] upset at the mere concept of this book,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s so often the case when it comes to people looking at women\u2019s responsibilities. Any time you deviate from what they consider to be the norm, then it\u2019s over. There\u2019s so little room for her to be respected in her choices.\u201d\n\n\n\nChanging course, she attempted the story from Roy\u2019s perspective as an innocent man behind bars. \u201cWhen I came at it from his point of view, it was more conventional,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel challenging enough, and that\u2019s when I decided to write it from all of their points of view, because you want your book to add to the conversation, not just reiterate a conversation that\u2019s already happened.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe result is a will-they-or-won\u2019t-they story told through the lens of not only Roy and Celestial but also members of their immediate family and close friend Andre, who occupies one corner of a love triangle that has perhaps always existed in the couples\u2019s relationship\u2014a relationship complicated by race, disrupted by time and perhaps always destined to challenge convention, as Jones discovered in the writing:\n\nThere are so many novels by white women that involve women trying to break free of the bounds of tradition, but I realized that in the white women\u2019s novels, the man is not in any trouble. So when she frees herself or changes the terms of her marriage, or what have you, because the man isn\u2019t in trouble, you don\u2019t worry about him, so her freedom isn\u2019t tied to anyone else. But with the black situation, the man is in trouble, so that if you reprioritize where his safety is not the first thing, or his care is not the first thing or the only thing on your list, there are consequences, because he actually needs you. And that is what makes Celestial\u2019s situation so complicated, but it\u2019s what makes it different than those other books.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut while the characters Jones has created are realistically flawed, there are no true villains in An American Marriage, only different interpretations of a tragic situation. That ambiguity is what makes the narrative so intriguing from start to finish\u2014though Jones almost didn\u2019t finish, finding herself \u201cstranded\u201d 50 pages from the end. She even began considering career paths other than her role as a professor at Rutgers University because \u201cthree-quarters of a book is the same as no book at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cI felt like I was in a boat,\u201d she said. \u201cI could see the shore, and I could not get there. Like, someone had stolen my oar, and it was very frustrating.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThough An American Marriage is Jones\u2019 fourth published work, she is very clear on the fact that the writing process is overwhelming, especially if you aren\u2019t able to dedicate yourself to it full time.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey always tell writers, \u2018Oh, you should write every day,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think that people need to stop saying that, because I feel that it\u2019s discouraging to busy people\u2014you know, to people who work\u2014working people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJones wrote her first book on a desk in her clothes closet\u2014with the clothes still hanging there. She stresses that patience is key: \u201cIf you can put in an hour three times a week, you can write your book. It\u2019ll take you longer, but I just think it\u2019s consistency, and you\u2019ll get it done.\u201d\n\nJones should know; An American Marriage is a six-year labor of love that is well-deserving of the mounting accolades it\u2019s receiving. But it\u2019s a triumph Jones readily shares with the community that has sustained her throughout her writing career:\n\nYou know what has been really delightful about this experience? You know, I\u2019ve been writing a long time, and it\u2019s been beautiful to share this with the people who were reading me all the time. I feel like we did this together. I feel like this victory is ours together. Black women, we don\u2019t throw our people away.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd as we ended our conversation, Jones also made sure to share the words of her longtime mentor, acclaimed writer and playwright Pearl Cleage:", "keywords": ["matter", "tayari", "love", "marriage", "heart", "know", "jones", "american", "book", "gets", "thats", "novel", "man", "didnt"], "polarity": 0.11714598997493736, "subjectivity": 0.5294200779727095},

Bangash, File (AP Images)\n\nThis may come as a surprise to no one, but [stage whispers] National Geographic (along with many other publications) used to be hella, obviously racist.\n\nShocking. I know.\n\nBut as it turns out, we don\u2019t even need to lash out at Nat Geo for its racist past, as the world-renowned magazine that explores science, geography, history and world culture has decided to come for its own wig and snatch itself bald, the first step to righting a long-overlooked and perhaps even taken-for-granted wrong.\n\nSusan Goldberg, the magazine\u2019s editor-in-chief, and perhaps not so coincidentally the magazine\u2019s first woman and first Jewish person to hold the title, penned an article for the Race Issue explaining how the magazine had invited a leading historian, University of Virginia professor John Edwin Mason, to investigate the magazine\u2019s coverage of people of color in the U.S. and abroad.\n\nGoldberg wrote:\n\nWhat Mason found in short was that until the 1970s National Geographic all but ignored people of color who lived in the United States, rarely acknowledging them beyond laborers or domestic workers. Meanwhile it pictured \u201cnatives\u201d elsewhere as exotics, famously and frequently unclothed, happy hunters, noble savages\u2014every type of clich\u00e9. Unlike magazines such as Life, Mason said, National Geographic did little to push its readers beyond the stereotypes ingrained in white American culture. \u201cAmericans got ideas about the world from Tarzan movies and crude racist caricatures,\u201d he said. \u201cSegregation was the way it was. National Geographic wasn\u2019t teaching as much as reinforcing messages they already received, and doing so in a magazine that had tremendous authority. National Geographic comes into existence at the height of colonialism, and the world was divided into the colonizers and the colonized. That was a color line, and National Geographic was reflecting that view of the world.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThroughout the article, Goldberg links to old articles and also displayed old photographs with the offensive, disparaging and/or racist captions that they carried. There was one referenced article, a 1916 story about Australia, that featured photos of two Aboriginal people. The caption accompanying that photo? \u201cSouth Australian Blackfellows: These savages rank lowest in intelligence of all human beings.\u201d\n\nAnd, as Mason pointed out to Goldberg, it was not just what the magazine included but what it also chose to omit:\n\nMason compared two stories we did about South Africa, one in 1962, the other in 1977. The 1962 story was printed two and a half years after the massacre of 69 black South Africans by police in Sharpeville, many shot in the back as they fled. The brutality of the killings shocked the world. \u201cNational Geographic\u2019s story barely mentions any problems,\u201d Mason said. \u201cThere are no voices of black South Africans. That absence is as important as what is in there. The only black people are doing exotic dances \u2026 servants or workers. It\u2019s bizarre, actually, to consider what the editors, writers and photographers had to consciously not see.\u201d Contrast that with the piece in 1977, in the wake of the U.S. civil rights era: \u201cIt\u2019s not a perfect article, but it acknowledges the oppression,\u201d Mason said. \u201cBlack people are pictured. Opposition leaders are pictured. It\u2019s a very different article.\u201d Fast-forward to a 2015 story about Haiti, when we gave cameras to young Haitians and asked them to document the reality of their world. \u201cThe images by Haitians are really, really important,\u201d Mason said, and would have been \u201cunthinkable\u201d in our past. So would our coverage now of ethnic and religious conflicts, evolving gender norms, the realities of today\u2019s Africa, and much more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBluntly acknowledging its own past in this way is indeed powerful, but it is not necessarily something, I think, that we should applaud, as much as we should expect ... especially at this time in our lives when race and discussions of racism and even general cultural insensitivity can be volatile, tense and perhaps even deadly.\n\nThis is something that National Geographic also readily accepts and acknowledges.\n\nGoldberg writes:\n\nApril 4 marks the 50th anniversary of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. It\u2019s a worthy moment to step back, to take stock of where we are on race. It\u2019s also a conversation that is changing in real time: In two years, for the first time in U.S. history, less than half the children in the nation will be white. So let\u2019s talk about what\u2019s working when it comes to race, and what isn\u2019t. Let\u2019s examine why we continue to segregate along racial lines and how we can build inclusive communities. Let\u2019s confront today\u2019s shameful use of racism as a political strategy and prove we are better than this.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndeed, let us confront the issue at hand, up front.\n\nWho wants to be next in line to drag themselves down the street?", "keywords": ["race", "magazines", "snatches", "past", "south", "racist", "mason", "article", "wig", "magazine", "world", "geographic", "black", "national"], "polarity": 0.04064697609001407, "subjectivity": 0.46653656821378353},

I HATE the title. \u201cBlack With (Some) White Privilege\u201d conjures up that time Very Smart Brotha\u2019s own Damon Young wrote \u201cStraight Black Men Are the White People of Black People..\u201d I got why folks hated that title then (even if I agreed in principle with his argument), and I hate this even more. Damon\u2019s piece stated that male privilege exists and that black males have some privilege by virtue of being male. THIS piece alleges that mixed kids exercise some sort of white privilege by virtue of having a white parent. I think this entire premise is flawed; it is ENTIRELY circumstantial. She\u2019s somehow conflating colorism with proximity to whiteness, and they\u2019re two entirely different things.\n\nYou can be light-skinned with two black parents and receive the same benefits from lightness as a person who is mixed. And what if you\u2019re a dark-skinned mixed person\u2014somebody whose background is entirely impossible to tell from skin tone\u2014and receive no \u201cbenefits\u201d? Then what? Do you still have some white privilege because of your white parent? Like, do they need to show up to prove it? Maybe you just can\u2019t use it in person, only on paper?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. I don\u2019t like this idea that there was some overarching political decision that so many black-and-white couples made after the Supreme Court decision to somehow stick it (no pun intended) to white supremacy by creating mixed children. While I\u2019m sure that some white folks absolutely rebelled in the form of their bedroom decisions, and some black folks took that opportunity, do we really believe that people are thinking about a Supreme Court decision when they meet and go through life together? I doubt it. If there\u2019s any proximity argument, I think this is where it exists. Most of these relationships\u2014whether married or not\u2014were born of desire, love and actual proximity.\n\n3. This passage:\n\nHow does having one white parent change that \u201ctwice as good\u201d calculation? Data on biracial people is tricky because it relies on self-reported identity. But my early inquiries into the Loving Generation showed that people with one black-identified and one white-identified parent seem to be disproportionately represented among black leaders and luminaries. Are our achievements impossible to separate from the benefits that, in this country, have always come with whiteness?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou know how you have an idea, then you find ideas to support it even if holes can be shot through it? So there are more mixed people than you\u2019d expect in the \u201cleaders and luminaries\u201d category. OK. Holmes points out several at the beginning of the piece, namely actors, politicos, entertainers, athletes, etc.\n\nFor some, in particular entertainers and politicos, it would be asinine to suggest that their skin tone\u2014folks like Alicia Keys, Mariah Carey and Halle Berry\u2014doesn\u2019t play a role in their success; their being mixed also contributed to their skin tone, of course. Carey may be an outlier because of her once-in-a-lifetime talent (the same with Derek Jeter and Jason Kidd, also name-checked in the article). But proximity to whiteness didn\u2019t help them out as much as their complexion. And how do you reconcile that with folks like Beyonc\u00e9 and Rihanna (and, hell, Muhammad Ali) who are (or was) light-skinned with two black parents? Are they just otherworldly talents? What about their white proximity?\n\n4. Then this passage:\n\nSometimes, when I looked at the list I had made, it seemed entirely possible that our direct connection to whiteness \u2014 through immediate and extended family \u2014 had contributed to a certain familiarity with, and therefore accessibility to, the white norms, traditions and power structures that so many of us depend on for opportunity and success. The common denominator in the Loving Generation wasn\u2019t necessarily so much white proximity as white acceptance and, in many cases, familial love and close connection to white people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOK, so it\u2019s not proximity, it\u2019s access to white people that begets other access to white people and the white power structure. I\u2019m connected to white people, so other white folks can tell and thus make an easier pathway toward success. Which, again, works if you can tell that a person is mixed and thus make a conscious decision because of it.\n\nWhat about the rest of us who aren\u2019t that easily discernible as mixed? What about our success? Not all heroes wear capes, and not all mixed people look like Meghan Markle. Or Vanessa Williams. Some of us actually aren\u2019t that noticeable and are considered light-skinned black folks by society writ large until we show up with or tell you we have a white parent. Doors don\u2019t open at that point either, by the way.\n\n5. And this:\n\nIt\u2019s likely, for example, that Barack Obama was able to imagine himself as president not just because he saw himself reflected in the white people around him, but because they saw themselves reflected in him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI do agree that President Barack Obama\u2019s proximity to whiteness absolutely helped shape his worldview, and being around white people who loved him unequivocally was a boon for him. Did that make him believe he could be the first black president? Eh. My black parents made me believe that I could, too. But being president seems like a terrible job, so I\u2019ve never had the smallest of inklings to want to go down that road. Now, I suppose the question is, did I actually think that I could? Whereas maybe Obama always believed it with his whole heart? That\u2019s a legit question.\n\n6. Holy mother of God:\n\nI knew, even as a young adult, that I moved among and around white people with relative ease, in a way that my blackness \u2014 and my own perception and self-consciousness of it \u2014 wasn\u2019t at the foreground. What I didn\u2019t know is whether that had something, or everything, to do with what I\u2019d accomplished.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m mixed\u2014my mother is a white woman\u2014and I have never moved around white people with relative ease, though I\u2019m not entirely sure what that means, either. In fact, short of my white mother, grandmother and stepfather, I am rarely around whiteness. I live in predominantly black cities and went to an HBCU and could literally put \u201cprofessional black person\u201d on my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 without a hint of comedy. I think most folks would call me successful, so how would we qualify that success? And what about dark-skinned black people who move with ease around white people?\n\n7. For heaven\u2019s sake:\n\nTurns out, I was not alone. Erin Cloud, a public defender in the South Bronx, has similar concerns. \u201cAt my job, there\u2019s actually a lot of biracial people that are in more leadership opportunities, and I think about that. I\u2019m like, \u2018Well, is that because there\u2019s something about their whiteness and our whiteness that is giving us space to communicate and that\u2019s why we\u2019re getting promotions and why we\u2019re moving forward?\u201d she said. \u201cI am a black woman. I see myself as a black woman, but I also have to be honest. I love my mother. I can\u2019t say for many of my black friends that they deeply, intimately, without any bounds love a white person.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI love my mother, who is white. We do nothing but argue and have nothing in common. I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m just an exception to this whole mixed life that others manage to live.\n\n8. Yep:\n\nThe writer and activist Rebecca Walker (1969) told \u201cThe Loving Generation\u201d director Lacey Schwartz last month that she believes biracial and mixed-race fluidity has led to significant cultural and political contributions. \u201cOur ability to see things from so many different perspectives has really been a boon for this culture,\u201d she said. She wonders, however, what the return is \u2014 that is, where do we go from here?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMixed-race fluidity? What is that? Is that a thing? (It\u2019s not.) I\u2019m mixed and I view life through a very, very black-perspective lens. Because that\u2019s my life; I\u2019m black. How do you even see things with a white perspective? What is that? I\u2019m REALLY asking. \u201cMixed-race fluidity\u201d implies that you have some choices and can move easily between worlds. I don\u2019t care to do that, but in my experiences, that\u2019s not a thing. Being mixed just means that you don\u2019t choose black, not that you are somehow white. Because that\u2019s not a choice you actually have outside of the confines of your own mind and friends who let you cook.\n\n9. It goes on, but that\u2019s my larger issue with this piece: You can\u2019t decide that colorism isn\u2019t at the heart of whatever \u201cprivilege\u201d is being attributed to whiteness. Mixed people come in so many different shades that you can\u2019t always tell. Sure, some mixed folks are lighter and thus, perhaps, benefit in ways that other mixed folks may not, but that\u2019s not because they\u2019re mixed; it\u2019s because they\u2019re light-skinned.\n\nWhat about me? I\u2019m light-skinned, but I seriously doubt that there\u2019s some significant benefit I\u2019ve received, even though I\u2019d wager that I have received some by virtue of my less-than-threatening visage. Saying that black folks receive white privilege is problematic because it entirely DISCOUNTS light-skinned points, something we joke about in the black community that is a real thing. You don\u2019t need to be half-white for that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. The most I\u2019ve ever discussed being \u201cmixed\u201d has been over the past six months. My life has been a largely black one since I was a child. I was raised in a black household, with some summers spent with my white mom in quasi-rural Michigan, where I was always aware of my blackness. Articles such as this push me further into the belief that my parents really did me a solid by not giving me a choice or considering me to be mixed in order to make sure I honored both of my parents. I am able to do so without trying to claim some racial connection that white people have spent centuries trying to remove from me.\n\nPlus, why would I want that? I can love my white mother and be black. But more important, to me, it\u2019s REALLY OK to be black. I don\u2019t need to focus on the white proximity or the adjacency or the gaze. I can be equally successful as a black person who fully embraces that part of myself. There\u2019s a reason I never think about whether my being mixed is partially responsible for my success\u2014I don\u2019t make it a thing. I don\u2019t allow others to focus on it. It\u2019s why I not only get to go to the cookout, but I can also bring macaroni and cheese.\n\nI can acknowledge that I receive some benefits because I\u2019m light-skinned\u2014because I am. I also have the wherewithal to acknowledge that my black parents (and sometimes, ironically, my white mother) raised a black man who is comfortable with his accomplishments, without also feeling as if the whiteness in my veins that nobody knows exists is the reason for those accomplishments. That\u2019s my beef with the piece and its centering so much whiteness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause it really is OK to black.", "keywords": ["york", "times", "oped", "im", "whiteness", "thoughts", "white", "dont", "privilege", "folks", "mixed", "thats", "holmes", "black", "proximity", "anna"], "polarity": 0.08471439626681555, "subjectivity": 0.38245688451333604},

I couldn\u2019t find a caramel-colored bra for the life of me, so I decided to get a white bra and attempt to dye it brown, or the closest color I could get to caramel. You see, if you were a brown-skinned woman, the nudes sold in department stores just weren\u2019t going to cut it. Needless to say, my brown-skin-color bra didn\u2019t really come out that great, and I was left with a mess in the dormitory bathroom.\n\nYears later, the quest for the perfect matching nude for women with tan or brown skin is still an issue. And in 2015, when Nubian Skin founder Ade Hassan launched her brand, it was because she decided it was time for \u201ca different kind of nude.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI came up with the idea in 2011. I was working and in consulting at the time, but I always wanted to do something entrepreneurial. A frequent problem that I had was ... when I wanted to wear hosiery that was my skin color. I think any black woman or woman of color usually crossed their fingers when they saw brown tights, but when they get them home, they were ashy,\u201d Hassan told The Root.\n\nIt was then that Hassan decided to take nude matters into her own hands, and in 2013 she started to trademark the company and flesh out a business plan.\n\n\u201cWe launched in 2014, and our campaign went viral in August that year. The reception over the last couple of years has been pretty amazing. Personally, I\u2019m grateful to black women who saw those images and reposted and retweeted and shouted about it so much that mainstream media finally picked it up,\u201d Hassan said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCurrently, Nubian Skin consists of lingerie and hosiery and, now, nude shoes that include heels and ballet flats. Not only can you find the products on the company\u2019s site, but Hassan\u2019s products are also at major retailers like Nordstrom and online at ASOS.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe shoes are online only, and it was just another thing where people went, like, \u2018OMG, I can finally have a nude for me,\u2019\u201d Hassan noted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe popularity of Nubian Skin has consistently risen over the last couple of years, but when it comes to other nude products that specifically cater to women of color, there\u2019s still a definite disconnect in the beauty and fashion industries. Sure, Christian Louboutin has a line of nude shoes, but can the average person randomly drop $875 for a pair of shoes, just to find the perfect brown? Of course not, but you don\u2019t have to with Nubian Skin around. With prices ranging from $94 to $124, you\u2019re not going to miss a car payment just to look fashionable.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say that Hassan, who could be considered a veteran in the nude game for women of color, has paved the way for other entrepreneurs looking to cater to those with brown skin. And in the world of cosmetics, where black women collectively spend an estimated $7.5 billion annually, you can\u2019t really say there are a lot of options out there if you want a nude look, especially when it comes to lipstick and nail polish. But that\u2019s where Mented Cosmetics hopes to fill the void.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMented Cosmetics is the brainchild of Harvard Business School graduates K.J. Miller and Amanda E. Johnson, and currently consists of nude lipsticks and nail polishes catering to women of color and our version of \u201cnude.\u201d\n\nMiller, who comes from a retail background, met Johnson at Harvard, from which they both graduated in 2014. Johnson, who has an investment banking background, said that the two women launched Mented last fall.\n\n\u201cWe knew we wanted to do a start-up together in business school. We just clicked,\u201d explains Johnson. \u201cAnd after school, we would meet up, and with my digital background and her retail background, we knew we were well suited for a company.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring a random conversation about makeup and beauty hacks, Johnson said they both realized that nudes for brown women were missing\u2014and that\u2019s how the idea came about.\n\n\u201cThere was something missing in the market for women of color when it came to nude lipsticks. It\u2019s something that should be a part of every woman\u2019s beauty routine, but it was missing,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nAfter heading to Sephora to try to see what it offered women of color in nude\u2014products that didn\u2019t include manipulating brown lip liner and pink lipstick to make it happen\u2014the women knew how important making a nude lipstick line was.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen it came to the research and development, Miller and Johnson were hands on.\n\n\u201cWe went to every makeup counter asking for nude lip, but they couldn\u2019t do it. So we said, \u2018OK, let\u2019s see if we can do it on our own,\u2019\u201d Miller said.\n\n\u201cWe then reached out to manufacturers all over the East Coast, explaining our concept and wanting to create nude shades for women of color, but they didn\u2019t get it. They wanted us to pick from their stock colors. But there were these pale pinks and super-dark browns. We taught ourselves how to make lipsticks with the aid of the internet. We crafted every single shade in our line,\u201d Miller said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd for those wondering, Mented lipsticks, which sell for $16.50, are vegan, paraben-free, nontoxic and cruelty free and proudly made in the USA.\n\nBy now you\u2019ve probably seen Mented posts on Facebook and Instagram, and the company has received praises for its products.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMiller, Johnson and Hassan didn\u2019t wait for someone else to make products that cater to them; they took matters into their own hands.\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to business, social media plays a huge role nowadays. Hassan noted that it\u2019s easier for people to launch their brands without spending a lot of money because you can easily develop a social media following.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really lucky in this day and age, because historically, it\u2019s been hard if you didn\u2019t have the money to advertise on TV or magazines, if you didn\u2019t have thousands or millions of dollars. Nowadays, with social media, you just need great images that are true to your brand,\u201d Hassan says. \u201cYou just need your phone and images; that\u2019s it. Be on social media and use it to your advantage. Use it to your advantage. You just need your phone.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMented used Instagram to their benefit by sending their products to influencers to garner feedback, which Miller says has been great.\n\n\u201cCustomers really enjoy feeling and being prioritized by a beauty brand,\u201d Miller said.\n\nCurrently, Mented has nine lipsticks and three nail polishes, but they plan on launching more products.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe feel Mented is a full-fledged beauty brand. This fall we\u2019ll be releasing lip gloss, and next year we\u2019ll move on to eyes and cheeks. We\u2019re going to introduce eye shadow palettes as well as blush and highlighter. From there, it\u2019ll be full face,\u201d Miller said.\n\nWith Nubian Skin and Mented Cosmetics giving women of color more options, you will probably see larger companies popping up with their own versions. But when you have companies that are for us and by us and are paving the way, I at least know who\u2019s going to get my coins.", "keywords": ["nudes", "women", "browns", "skin", "fashion", "beauty", "nude", "comes", "brown", "color", "miller", "johnson", "mented", "didnt", "hassan"], "polarity": 0.14523956496178714, "subjectivity": 0.4843601802861061},

Bangash, File (AP Images)\n\nThis may come as a surprise to no one, but [stage whispers] National Geographic (along with many other publications) used to be hella, obviously racist.\n\nShocking. I know.\n\nBut as it turns out, we don\u2019t even need to lash out at Nat Geo for its racist past, as the world-renowned magazine that explores science, geography, history and world culture has decided to come for its own wig and snatch itself bald, the first step to righting a long-overlooked and perhaps even taken-for-granted wrong.\n\nSusan Goldberg, the magazine\u2019s editor-in-chief, and perhaps not so coincidentally the magazine\u2019s first woman and first Jewish person to hold the title, penned an article for the Race Issue explaining how the magazine had invited a leading historian, University of Virginia professor John Edwin Mason, to investigate the magazine\u2019s coverage of people of color in the U.S. and abroad.\n\nGoldberg wrote:\n\nWhat Mason found in short was that until the 1970s National Geographic all but ignored people of color who lived in the United States, rarely acknowledging them beyond laborers or domestic workers. Meanwhile it pictured \u201cnatives\u201d elsewhere as exotics, famously and frequently unclothed, happy hunters, noble savages\u2014every type of clich\u00e9. Unlike magazines such as Life, Mason said, National Geographic did little to push its readers beyond the stereotypes ingrained in white American culture. \u201cAmericans got ideas about the world from Tarzan movies and crude racist caricatures,\u201d he said. \u201cSegregation was the way it was. National Geographic wasn\u2019t teaching as much as reinforcing messages they already received, and doing so in a magazine that had tremendous authority. National Geographic comes into existence at the height of colonialism, and the world was divided into the colonizers and the colonized. That was a color line, and National Geographic was reflecting that view of the world.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThroughout the article, Goldberg links to old articles and also displayed old photographs with the offensive, disparaging and/or racist captions that they carried. There was one referenced article, a 1916 story about Australia, that featured photos of two Aboriginal people. The caption accompanying that photo? \u201cSouth Australian Blackfellows: These savages rank lowest in intelligence of all human beings.\u201d\n\nAnd, as Mason pointed out to Goldberg, it was not just what the magazine included but what it also chose to omit:\n\nMason compared two stories we did about South Africa, one in 1962, the other in 1977. The 1962 story was printed two and a half years after the massacre of 69 black South Africans by police in Sharpeville, many shot in the back as they fled. The brutality of the killings shocked the world. \u201cNational Geographic\u2019s story barely mentions any problems,\u201d Mason said. \u201cThere are no voices of black South Africans. That absence is as important as what is in there. The only black people are doing exotic dances \u2026 servants or workers. It\u2019s bizarre, actually, to consider what the editors, writers and photographers had to consciously not see.\u201d Contrast that with the piece in 1977, in the wake of the U.S. civil rights era: \u201cIt\u2019s not a perfect article, but it acknowledges the oppression,\u201d Mason said. \u201cBlack people are pictured. Opposition leaders are pictured. It\u2019s a very different article.\u201d Fast-forward to a 2015 story about Haiti, when we gave cameras to young Haitians and asked them to document the reality of their world. \u201cThe images by Haitians are really, really important,\u201d Mason said, and would have been \u201cunthinkable\u201d in our past. So would our coverage now of ethnic and religious conflicts, evolving gender norms, the realities of today\u2019s Africa, and much more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBluntly acknowledging its own past in this way is indeed powerful, but it is not necessarily something, I think, that we should applaud, as much as we should expect ... especially at this time in our lives when race and discussions of racism and even general cultural insensitivity can be volatile, tense and perhaps even deadly.\n\nThis is something that National Geographic also readily accepts and acknowledges.\n\nGoldberg writes:\n\nApril 4 marks the 50th anniversary of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. It\u2019s a worthy moment to step back, to take stock of where we are on race. It\u2019s also a conversation that is changing in real time: In two years, for the first time in U.S. history, less than half the children in the nation will be white. So let\u2019s talk about what\u2019s working when it comes to race, and what isn\u2019t. Let\u2019s examine why we continue to segregate along racial lines and how we can build inclusive communities. Let\u2019s confront today\u2019s shameful use of racism as a political strategy and prove we are better than this.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndeed, let us confront the issue at hand, up front.\n\nWho wants to be next in line to drag themselves down the street?", "keywords": ["race", "magazines", "snatches", "past", "south", "racist", "mason", "article", "wig", "magazine", "world", "geographic", "black", "national"], "polarity": 0.04064697609001407, "subjectivity": 0.46653656821378353},

But the first and most important thing that this capsule should hold is the text of Mark Lilla\u2019s \u201cThe End of Identity Liberalism.\u201d\n\nAlthough published in November 2016, several days after Donald Trump was elected president, it managed to be both predictive of 2017 and indicative of it. It\u2019s also perhaps still the most prominent example of a new subgenre of disclosure that was born after the election and spread into 2017, where white people attempt to explain and sympathize with other white people\u2019s problematic political leanings without using the words \u201crace\u201d or \u201cracism.\u201d\n\nAnd like Citizen Kane and other form-subverting standard-bearers before him, Lilla invented his own rules for this genre by not only ignoring the role that race plays in our cultural and political landscape but also blaming the \u201crhetoric of diversity\u201d\u2014people merely wishing that their racial and cultural differences be respected and acknowledged because, for many of us, it\u2019s literally a lifesaving proposition\u2014for Trump\u2019s rise. As I said in an essay I wrote about this piece last year, he\u2019s the \u201cFrank Lloyd Wright of whitesplaining.\u201d\n\nAnd then what followed in 2017 was example after example of progressive and liberal white people stretching like Elastigirl to explain themselves and their cousins without indicting themselves and failing miserably, showing us their whole entire asses in the process. It was as if all of the cluelessness and obliviousness were gathered together and ground up, mixed into a stew with a generous batch of performative sobriety and then served to us on a slice of avocado toast.\n\nOf course, we\u2014well, most of us\u2014didn\u2019t need liberal white people to remind us that they\u2019re white. This is not something we have the privilege to forget because niggas with selective amnesia get dead. But us not needing to be reminded hasn\u2019t stopped them from trying to. It\u2019s as if they all went to the same convention this year where they were forced to wear name tags that read, \u201cYeah, but I\u2019m white, though,\u201d and they all forgot to take them off.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMind you, this doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be a bad thing. Acknowledgment of the possession of whiteness\u2014and all that it means\u2014is a vital initial step in attempting to rectify America\u2019s race-based wrongs. But what happened instead for many of these liberal whites was that this knowledge wasn\u2019t self-determined.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t them realizing that they\u2019re white. It was everyone else watching them act and react and then acknowledging just how aggressively white these actions were. And then the acknowledgment of whiteness reminded these liberals and progressives that they could always slip back into the safe confines of it when convenient.\n\nPerhaps, when Lilla\u2019s piece is placed in the capsule, we can put it on a slice of avocado toast, too.

It was a triumph as epic as the film itself. But Panther isn\u2019t the only black-helmed film being released by Disney this winter; we are now only two weeks away from the release of A Wrinkle in Time, directed by Ava DuVernay.\n\nFeaturing Oprah, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Mindy Kaling, Reese Witherspoon and Chris Pine and starring newcomer Storm Reid as young heroine Meg Murry, A Wrinkle in Time is certain to serve up its own brand of black-girl movie magic on March 9. And along with all of you avid filmgoers, we especially think our girls should be there to see it.\n\nEnter the \u201cA Wrinkle in Time Challenge\u201d (#AWITChallenge): an initiative to buy out eight theaters in cities around the country\u2014Austin, Texas; Charlotte, N.C.; Chicago; Greensboro, N.C.; Houston; Philadelphia; Plainfield, N.J.; and Washington, D.C.\u2014for black girls (and nonboys) to see the film on opening weekend.\n\nCoordinated by the online group Sisters in the Storm, \u201ca collective of black women focused on community engagement and Sisterhood among black women & non-men,\u201d a GoFundMe page has been created with the aim of raising $25,000, reaching nearly half their goal in the past 10 days, with just under a week left to go. But behind their valiant mission is a heartbreaking story, as co-founder Sherronda J. Brown explains in an essay at Medium:\n\nIn late January, a black girl named Stormiyah Denson-Jackson passed away in an apparent suicide at the public boarding school she attended. She was twelve years old and already madly in love with math and science\u2014a #RealMeg. But this love she had made her the target of bullying and verbal abuse from her classmates. Devastated by their taunts, she chose to end her life rather than live with the shame they tried to make her feel for being a \u201cnerd\u201d who enjoyed engaging with sciences and mathematics. There is a narrow image of blackness in the social imagination, mired with stereotypes and white ascendant ideals about black intellect, capability, and mobility. For black women and girls, beliefs, about our blackness\u2014how it is allowed to look, what it is allowed to achieve\u2014can never be divorced from beliefs about our gender. There is a social stigma about challenging these expectations and permissions, and it constantly impacts our experiences in the world, but never more significantly than when we are growing up, learning who we are, and deciding who we want to become.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike the momentum that grew around the #BlackPantherChallenge, raising over $620,000 from all 50 states to make it possible for black children to see themselves reflected on film, Sisters of the Storm\u2019s act of love and generosity is inspiring others to do the same for the #AWITChallenge. For instance, writer and Lemonade Syllabus creator Candice Benbow has set her own goal to make A Wrinkle in Time accessible to 200 girls in Hamilton, N.J. As she told The Glow Up, it\u2019s a gift she hopes to make in memory of her mother:\n\nI wanted to ensure that we do our part to support Ava and this film just like we supported Ryan Coogler and Black Panther. But also, my mom took me to the library every Friday, and would take me to the movies whenever something came out for kids. This movie and the moment around it reminds me of my childhood and time with my mother. I wanted to honor that by participating in this challenge so black girls today can look back on similar memories and smile. What Ava has done with this film made history, and black girls need to see that there is no dream too big for them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe have seen firsthand the impact that seeing black superheroes on film can have on our children\u2014and ourselves. With A Wrinkle in Time, we also have yet another opportunity\u2014and plenty of incentive\u2014to show Hollywood that blockbusters star black people, too.\n\nBut for real-life Meg Murrys, or Shuris, or other struggling Stormiyah Denson-Jacksons, A Wrinkle in Time may also provide exactly the affirmation and inspiration they need to flourish as their brilliant, STEM-loving, \u201cblack girl nerd\u201d selves. As Brown wrote: \u201cSeeing ourselves represented as heroes has undeniable power, and feeling our absence in these roles also influences the way that we see ourselves and our blackness.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s do it again, y\u2019all.\n\nThe Glow Up tip: A Wrinkle in Time opens in theaters on Friday, March 9. You can support Sisters in the Storm\u2019s $25,000 #AWITChallenge via its GoFundMe page until March 1.

Earlier this month, Oprah Winfrey paid tribute to Taylor in a rousing Golden Globes speech that has been watched at least 9 million times.\n\nBut Winfrey wasn\u2019t done paying homage to the civil rights pioneer.\n\nLate Tuesday night, Winfrey posted a photo to her Instagram account showing her at Taylor\u2019s gravesite in Abbeville, Ala.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe in coincidences, but if I did, this would be a powerful one,\u201d Winfrey wrote. \u201cOn assignment for 60 Minutes, I end up in the town of Abbeville, where Recy Taylor suffered injustice, endured and recently died.\u201d\n\nWinfrey expressed gratitude for being able to visit her grave \u201cso soon after \u2018speaking her name.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking to the Associated Press about why the visit meant a lot to her, Winfrey noted that she didn\u2019t even know who Taylor was until a couple of years ago.\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons I wanted to use her as a part of my Golden Globes speech is I wanted everybody to know that the #MeToo movement didn\u2019t just start now,\u201d Winfrey said. \u201cThere have been women who have endured, women who have not only survived but thrived in the face of injustices for years.

We take those claims very seriously and investigate them thoroughly,\u201d Ford wrote, adding that the company has a \u201ccomprehensive approach to prevent and address sexual harassment and discrimination\u201d at its facilities, which includes anti-harassment training for all new hires and multiple channels to report violations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn addition, more than two years ago, we began taking further actions at our Chicago plants,\u201d Ford wrote, listing a few of its initiatives, like providing \u201cadditional leadership and diversity training for all salaried employees.\u201d\n\nSome of these changes were listed in the original Times piece, although several of the Times\u2019 sources told the paper that misconduct still occurs to this day. Others say that their previous experiences have them so shaken up, they still dread going to work.\n\nSeveral others said that things really are getting better, including one woman who told the paper that \u201cfor the first time in years ... a manager was taking her complaints seriously.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarlier:\n\nAs is becoming customary in this news cycle, the New York Times published a harrowing investigation Tuesday that details years of sexual abuse endured by women\u2014this time, those who worked at Ford Motor Co. plants in Chicago.\n\n\n\nUnlike most mainstream articles on sexual harassment, this investigation, by Susan Chira and Catrin Einhorn, focused almost exclusively on black women.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe experiences that the Ford employees recount are appalling\u2014and several are recent (the alleged abuses stretch from the 1990s to 2015). Their stories also illuminate something that hasn\u2019t been talked about in the mainstream media\u2019s coverage of #MeToo: the intersection of racial and sexual harassment that women of color, particularly black women, experience.\n\nTake Suzette Wright, who was hired to work at the Ford Chicago Assembly plant in 1993:\n\n\ufeffAs Ms. Wright [a recent employee] settled in, she asked a co-worker to explain something: Why were men calling out \u201cpeanut butter legs\u201d when she arrived in the morning? He demurred, but she insisted. \u201cHe said, \u2018Well, peanut butter,\u2019\u201d Ms. Wright recalled. \u201c\u2018Not only is it the color of your legs, but it\u2019s the kind of legs you like to spread.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWright would end up becoming one of the female employees who sued the motor company; the Times notes that most of them were black.\n\nThose accused of harassment include black, white and Latino men. Some of the women felt doubly victimized \u2014 propositioned and denounced as sluts while also being called \u201cblack bitches\u201d and other racial slurs. (The assembly plant\u2019s work force is predominantly African-American, while the stamping plant\u2019s is majority white.)\ufeff\n\nThe Chicago Assembly Plant and the Chicago Stamping Plant were especially volatile, the Times reports, due to \u201ca mix of sex, swagger, suspicion and racial resentment.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company has been hit with multiple lawsuits over the past 20 years, the Times reports. In the \u201990s, Ford was forced to pay out a $22 million settlement in response to multiple harassment claims. But the culture of abuse continued\u2014the article notes that another $10 million settlement was reached in August of this year for sexual and racial harassment, with another suit still percolating through the courts.\n\nHere\u2019s another typical account that sums up how the complaints lodged by black women were frequently ignored or shushed:\n\nChristie Van arrived at Chicago Assembly with the influx of transfers in 2012. She said a supervisor who had been giving her easy jobs like placing radiator caps began asking her to \u201cplay hooky\u201d from work with him. She claimed that the man, Mike Riese, told her his preferred nickname: \u201cHe called himself White Chocolate. He said that he had a black man\u2019s dick.\u201d\ufeff\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChristie Van filed a complaint the same year after another supervisor showed her a picture of his dick on his phone. As the Times reports, company records show that \u201cseveral co-workers denied her account and described her as disgruntled to Ford investigators.\u201d But two other employees who could verify Van\u2019s account were never questioned in Ford\u2019s investigation.\n\nVan\u2019s complaint was never substantiated, and it took several other women accusing Riese of harassment before he was fired three years later, in 2015.\n\nAnd what of the union, which is supposed to protect workers from these kinds of abuses? Here\u2019s what happened when Wright, who had endured aggressive and persistent harassment, went to her union rep:\n\nBut after a man Ms. Wright had trusted as a mentor made a crack about paying her $5 for oral sex, she asked her union representative for help. He began what she calls a \u201cdon\u2019t-file-a-claim-against-Bill\u201d campaign: Her co-worker would lose his job, his benefits, his pension, she was told. Rumors spread, questioning their relationship. Then a union official delivered the final insult: \u201cSuzette, you\u2019re a pretty woman \u2014 take it as a compliment.\u201d\ufeff\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGrant Morton, a union official who did try to keep the plant accountable, says he was discouraged by Ford managers from helping women submit harassment complaints, and claimed in a suit that management \u201cretaliated against him\u201d when he would bring complaints forward, the Times reports.\n\nAt play in the Ford case are multiple factors: Plant employees were especially vulnerable to their managers\u2019 whims and behaviors, and there are class issues at play in the Ford case that are not true of other industries that have come to the fore in the wake of #MeToo (specifically, media and Hollywood).\n\nBut few other stories have focused so much on the experience of black women; nor have they captured the racial animosity that workers can be subjected to, on top of the horrendous sexual trespasses. As New York Times writer Jenna Wortham mentioned recently on Twitter, \u201cWhen will it be time to figure out what a racial misconduct reckoning looks like?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Ford piece, along with Rebecca Carroll\u2019s Esquire article about former news CBS anchor Charlie Rose, hints at the difficult space women of color occupy in these discussions. However, in the case of the Times investigation, the racial harassment comes off as a corollary to the sexual trespasses. We have still to dedicate space in the mainstream media to investigations of systemic racial misconduct\u2014certainly not with the vigor and resources that have characterized recent inquiries into sexual abuse.\n\nThere is space\u2014and it is necessary\u2014to do both.\n\nAs the Ford case shows, women of color are particularly vulnerable as targets of both racial and sexual abuse. When they attempt to fight back, they\u2019re met not just with silence but with aggressive attempts to put them in their place. And as Sharon Dunn, who sued Ford in the \u201990s, told the Times, even when you win, nothing changes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFor all the good that was supposed to come out of what happened to us, it seems like Ford did nothing,\u201d Dunn told the Times. \u201cIf I had that choice today, I wouldn\u2019t say a damn word.\u201d\n\nRead more at the New York Times.", "keywords": ["workplace", "times", "women", "wright", "silences", "told", "sexual", "harassment", "racial", "chicago", "black", "ford"], "polarity": 0.0833166833166833, "subjectivity": 0.4426490176490177},

This profile bothered quite a few people, who were somewhat annoyed that the country\u2019s biggest and most important newspaper would give a white nationalist a Better Homes and Gardens cover spread.\n\nThe Times was kind enough to respond to that response. And I felt it was only right to top off the response lasagna by giving a response to that response, which is underneath the Times\u2019 response to the response.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nResponse response response response response response response.\n\nThe Times explained:\n\nA profile in The Times of Tony Hovater, a white nationalist and Nazi sympathizer in Ohio, elicited a huge amount of feedback this weekend, most of it sharply critical. Here\u2019s how the piece came about, why we wrote it and why we think it was important to do so.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis should be fun.\n\nThe genesis of the story was the aftermath of the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., in August, the terrifying Ku Klux Klan-like images of young white men carrying tiki torches and shouting \u201cJews will not replace us,\u201d and the subsequent violence that included the killing of a woman, Heather D. Heyer.\n\nThose images were truly terrible, and the murder of Heather D. Heyer was horrifying. As was the response from the president of the United States of America about what happened in Charlottesville.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFortunately, we have institutions like the New York Times that we can depend on to bring us the truth during these dark hours and to ensure that white supremacists and Nazis are thought of and treated the same way you might treat a roach scurrying across a kitchen counter.\n\nWho were those people?\n\nUm, wait. You literally just answered that question in your last paragraph. Those people are white supremacists. And just to reiterate that point, you refer to them as \u201cyoung white men carrying tiki torches and shouting \u2018Jews will not replace us.\u2019\u201d What the hell is happening here? Did you have a stroke between the writing of these sentences?\n\nWe assigned Richard Fausset, one of our smartest thinkers and best writers, to profile one of the far-right foot soldiers at the rally. We ended up settling on Mr. Hovater, who, it turned out, was a few years older than another Ohio man, James Alex Fields Jr., who was charged with murder after the authorities said he drove his car into a crowd of protesters, killing Ms. Heyer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut why, though? You could have assigned an intern for this task. Shit, you could have assigned me. I would have just emailed Hovater.\n\n\u201cYo, dude. You still on that Nazi shit?\u201d\n\nIf he replied \u201cYes,\u201d I would have written the story on the spot. And it would have been called, \u201cTony Hovater Is Still on That Nazi Shit and There\u2019s Really Nothing Else to See Here.\u201d And the entire text of the story would have been \u201cNazis gonna Nazi.\u201d\n\nOur reporter went to Ohio to spend time with Mr. Hovater and submitted several drafts and updates in between assignments that included Hurricane Harvey in Houston, Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico and the Roy Moore campaign in Alabama. The story finally ran online Saturday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s great that Richard Fausset has other responsibilities at the Times other than existing as the Ohio-Nazi Whisperer. I\u2019d imagine the Ohio-Nazi-whispering beat to be quite dry.\n\nWhatever our goal, a lot of readers found the story offensive, with many seizing on the idea we were normalizing neo-Nazi views and behavior. \u201cHow to normalize Nazis 101!\u201d one reader wrote on Twitter. \u201cI\u2019m both shocked and disgusted by this article,\u201d wrote another. \u201cAttempting to \u2018normalize\u2019 white supremacist groups \u2013 should Never have been printed!\u201d\n\nIf the goal of devoting thousands of words to a fucking Nazi in Ohio wasn\u2019t disgust, then what was it? Seriously. What was the fucking point of this? We already know that Nazis exist in America. And we already know that some of them shop at Target. So, again, what was your goal?\n\nOur reporter and his editors agonized over the tone and content of the article. The point of the story was not to normalize anything but to describe the degree to which hate and extremism have become far more normal in American life than many of us want to think.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI, for one, am sorry that your reporter and his editors agonized over doing the fucking jobs that they are paid to do. That reporters and editors would be expected to report and edit and vet is truly a travesty, and I\u2019m sure the family of Heather Heyer would agree. I will organize a candlelight vigil for your newsroom this evening.\n\nWe described Mr. Hovater as a bigot, a Nazi sympathizer who posted images on Facebook of a Nazi-like America full of happy white people and swastikas everywhere. We understand that some readers wanted more pushback, and we hear that loud and clear.\n\nYes. It would have been nice, if the New York Times decided to run a profile on a Nazi, for said profile to have provided more pushback. Because if there\u2019s one thing we know about Nazis, they can always use more pushback. There\u2019s never a point, in regard to Nazis and pushback, where you might step back and say, \u201cYou know, I think this Nazi pushback is overkill now.\u201d Because there is no overkill with Nazi pushback. Just underkill. And by \u201cunderkill\u201d I mean \u201ca profile in the New York Times.\u201d\n\nSome readers also criticized the article for including a link to a webpage that sells swastika armbands. This was intended to show the darker reality beyond the anodyne language of the website. But we saw the criticism, agreed and removed the link.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWait, y\u2019all did what? Y\u2019all gave the Nazis a branding platform? What the fuck is wrong with y\u2019all?\n\nSome readers did see value in the piece. Shane Bauer, a senior reporter at Mother Jones and a winner of the National Magazine Award, tweeted: \u201cPeople mad about this article want to believe that Nazis are monsters we cannot relate to. White supremacists are normal ass white people and it\u2019s been that way in America since 1776. We will continue to be in trouble till we understand that.\u201d\n\nYeah, some people saw the value in the piece. And some people put lettuce in the microwave. What\u2019s your point?\n\nBut far more were outraged by the article. \u201cYou know who had nice manners?\u201d Bess Kalb, a writer for Jimmy Kimmel Live, said on Twitter. \u201cThe Nazi who shaved my uncle Willie\u2019s head before escorting him into a cement chamber where he locked eyes with children as their lungs filled with poison and they suffocated to death in agony. Too much? Exactly. That\u2019s how you write about Nazis.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBess Kalb has a point.\n\nOthers urged us to focus our journalism less on those pushing hate and more on those on the receiving end of that hate. \u201cInstead of long, glowing profiles of Nazis/White nationalists, why don\u2019t we profile the victims of their ideologies?\u201d asked Karen Attiah, an editor at The Washington Post. \u201cWhy not a piece about the mother of Heather Heyer, the woman who was killed in Charlottesville? Follow-ups on those who were injured? Or how PoC are coping?\u201d\n\nOf course, profiles on the people directly harmed by this hate speech and violence would be much more compelling. But that would require whiteness\u2014white maleness, specifically\u2014to be uncentered. And uncentering whiteness is harder than eating just one Lay\u2019s potato chip, apparently.\n\nWe regret the degree to which the piece offended so many readers. We recognize that people can disagree on how best to tell a disagreeable story. What we think is indisputable, though, is the need to shed more light, not less, on the most extreme corners of American life and the people who inhabit them. That\u2019s what the story, however imperfectly, tried to do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s a difference between shedding light and handing someone the spotlight. I agree that light is necessary to expose and, if required, shame. But y\u2019all basically gave him and the thousands like him the light and the mic. Instead of truly depicting him for who he is, you let him take a selfie. And it\u2019s not wrong to believe that \u201cNo country for Nazi selfies\u201d should be an editorial edict at the New York Times.\n\nAs always, we want to continue hearing from our readers. Please share your thoughts in the comments. We will be reading them.\n\nWait, you\u2019re going to do more work? Shit.

I love them so much that I have two pairs: the wine-and-navy-blue \u201cNew Heights\u201d colorway and the black \u201cMetallic Gold\u201d colorway. They go with everything, and the fit is comfortable enough (and they\u2019re light enough) that I don\u2019t actually feel like I\u2019m wearing basketball shoes.\n\nAnd I\u2019m not much of a basketball-shoe fan in general. I own two pairs of Jordans\u2014they\u2019re both Jordan 1s\u2014and the rest of my shoes are running shoes, casual shoes or boots. Even buying these LeBrons took a while, since, again, I\u2019m not big on basketball shoes and I\u2019ve always found his to look rather bulky on display in stores.\n\nBut one day I was in Foot Locker\u2019s House of Hoops section, and I saw the New Heights XVs sitting on display. I thought they looked interesting, but they also looked pretty unflattering. That day I kept it moving, but the shoes stayed in the back of my mind.\n\nThat\u2019s how I end up buying most of the shoes I like: They stay on my mind. I rarely buy shoes the first time I see them. But if I can\u2019t shake the idea that I want them, I\u2019ll typically go back. I returned to Foot Locker to check them out on every trip to the mall but was still unconvinced that they were shoes I needed to own.\n\nI follow LeBron on Instagram, and there are tons of pictures of his shoes on his feed. The vast majority of them didn\u2019t get me. But there was one picture I saw where he was standing against a car dressed in street clothes, wearing something similar enough to what I\u2019d wear, and he had on his shoes; they looked awesome.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt that point, I decided that I was going to go try them on. Even though I found them unremarkable on display, seeing them on his feet (even through the \u2019gram) rocketed my passing interest to coveting.\n\nSo I went to the store, tried them on and realized, \u201cOh, sweet Jesus\u2014these joints are beauuuutiful on my feet.\u201d Perhaps it\u2019s hyperbolic, but I loved how they looked. I plopped down my money with a smile on my face, feeling ecstatic to separate myself from my hard-earned $196.10 (including tax).\n\nAfter wearing them out, a funny thing started to happen: Several dudes told me that seeing them on somebody convinced them that the shoes were actually pretty fly. It seems that I wasn\u2019t the only one struggling with whether the XVs were dope or not. Some folks were going to buy them because they\u2019re LeBrons. Others are sneakerheads, and while I\u2019m a fringe sneakerhead, I have no idea if the XVs were a hype-beast shoe of choice. But many of us were looking at them in stores and just unconvinced of their potential. But seeing them on my feet changed the game for some people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s happened at least five times. The latest was at a baby shower I attended this past weekend. I threw on the black XVs, and while I was walking around snapping pictures of the event, a friend of mine stopped me and said, \u201cYou\u2019ve convinced me.\u201d I asked him what he was talking about, and he pointed at my feet and said he\u2019d been on the fence, but seeing them on my feet persuaded him that he should cop them.\n\nIt happened at a nightclub once as well. I was walking around minding my business when two dudes walked up to me and said something very similar\u2014that on display, the XVs just don\u2019t look that dope, so they hadn\u2019t even thought to try them on until they peeped them on my feet. Happened at brunch once and randomly at a restaurant bar while I was eating lunch\u2014on the street once, too. It seems that LeBron\u2019s XVs are the ultimate in deceptively fly.\n\nIf you\u2019re into shoes at all, you\u2019re going to pay attention to them. You may hate them, but you will notice them, and I even imagine it\u2019s hard to hate them because they\u2019re so distinctive. The shoes are made of \u201cBattleKnit,\u201d a Flyknit-weave take on the Flyknit material that so many running shoes are currently made of, with the very popular \u201csock\u201d styling that\u2019s all over the sneaker market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey have a look to them, but in stores they look oddly shaped at best. And even on LeBron\u2019s feet in the games\u2014there are tons of pictures featuring his shoes\u2014they didn\u2019t sway me one way or another. And while GQ called the shoes as cool as LeBron is, I was still skeptical.\n\nNope\u2014it took seeing them on LeBron\u2019s feet in a picture of him doing regular shit (and other people complimenting them in everyday wear) for me to realize how awesome they are from a fashion standpoint, and now they\u2019re my go-to shoe for everything from church to picking up hog maws.\n\nI\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t \u201cpass\u201d on these shoes. Get it? Pass. Because LeBron likes to ... pass the ball?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019ll see myself out.", "keywords": ["right", "theyre", "shoes", "seeing", "im", "favorite", "apparently", "look", "nike", "feet", "lebron", "xvs", "lebrons", "looked", "skeptical"], "polarity": 0.14941289224871313, "subjectivity": 0.5803408863110355},

My job is to make sure we produce quality journalism for our readers. Yes, that means I have to make difficult decisions. Running a newspaper isn\u2019t a popularity contest.

There were a good many stories about his peripatetic life. Funny stories about white people, black people, southern sheriffs and the CIA, whose agents he described as \u2018spooks.\u2019\n\n\u201cHe talked about the scholarship he received to attend Southern Illinois University at Carbondale, from which he did not graduate. He talked about comedy clubs in New York City, other clubs in the Midwest, that kept food on the table. He couldn\u2019t remember if he went to his father\u2019s funeral; it was a strained relationship.\n\n\u201cWe talked about the civil rights movement, and how he had gotten involved. He said it was because of James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner, the civil rights workers who were murdered in Mississippi in 1964.

The majority of these people are young vulnerable children, mothers and infants in need of urgent help.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFurthermore, health workers have warned of an impending health crisis due to the fact that corpses have been left in the out and mass burial of bodies is still underway.\n\n\u201cMany agencies working on the ground are doing their utmost best to respond to the disaster, which has now been described as unprecedented tragedy.\n\n\u201cAs the painstaking task of recovering the victims continues, I have been appalled by the lack of outcry or support from the international community. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCharlottesville Paper Blames Black Vice Mayor\n\n\u201cOn August 10, the Charlottesville Daily Progress published an editorial in anticipation of a rally that attracted hundreds of white nationalists, neo-Nazis, neo-Confederates, and racists \u2014 many of them armed \u2014 to the recently renamed Emancipation Park,\u201d Brendan Fitzgerald wrote Aug. 15 for Columbia Journalism Review.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMore than once, the editorial asks, \u2018How did we get here?\u2019\n\n\u201cBy way of an answer, the Daily Progress editorial board assigned responsibility. The editorial\u2019s headline urged a lone city councilor \u2014 Vice Mayor Wes Bellamy \u2014 to \u2018speak up now to calm [a] raging fire.\u2019 Bellamy, who is the only black person on the City Council and who was elected in 2015 with a greater number of votes than any other candidate, organized a press conference in Emancipation Park last year and called for the removal of the [Robert E.] Lee statue.\n\n\u201cHe was not the first councilor to consider such an action; councilor Kristin Szakos mentioned the idea in 2013, before Bellamy publicly announced his candidacy. But Szakos is never named in the editorial. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFitzgerald also writes, \u201cJust days before hundreds of white nationalists, neo-Nazis, neo-Confederates, and racists walked across the grounds of the University of Virginia carrying lit torches \u2014 and before a Hitler-fixated man was charged with murder and malicious wounding after he drove a car into a group of protesters \u2014 Charlottesville\u2019s daily newspaper argued that Vice Mayor Wes Bellamy had \u2018dropped a match on a gas field.\u2019 . . .\u201d\n\nFitzgerald calls the editorial an \u201cinept assignation of blame.\u201d He also wrote, \u201cDecades ago \u2014 though not before the dedication of the Lee statue\u2014the Progress published two separate newspapers \u2014 \u201cone with white society news and one with black society news.\u201d With last week\u2019s editorial, the Progress risks bifurcating its audience again. . . .\u201d\n\nAngela Helm, The Root: How Wes Bellamy, the 30-Year-Old Vice Mayor of Charlottesville, Va., Plans to Move His City Forward\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSPJ Says Journalists Should Speak Out on Bias\n\n\u201cObjectivity is correctly cited as an elemental trait of good journalists, which is exhibited in their ability to separate fact from fiction regardless of their personal biases,\u201d Andrew M.

Objectivity and equivalence are not the same.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPeople and journalists in the United States are asking a lot of questions in the wake of the deadly protests, riots and attacks that occurred over the weekend in Charlottesville, Virginia. Those questions grow more complex as the White House continues to issue conflicting statements.\n\n\u201cFor journalists covering Charlottesville, its effect on their communities or similar events, the question may be: How can I objectively cover people who spew racism, anti-Semitism, homophobia and other outdated and repugnant beliefs?\n\n\u201cThe answer is that we objectively know that discrimination based on sex, race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability and other inherited traits is wrong. Journalists should feel free to say so and forcefully challenge people who believe otherwise. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnivision CEO Unequivocal on White Supremacists\n\n\u201cUnivision CEO Randy Falco is speaking out in the wake of Charlottesville violence and the President\u2019s suggestion that both sides had good people and shared the blame,\u201d John Eggerton reported Friday for Broadcasting & Cable.\n\n\u201cFalco said that as the CEO of a company serving the \u2018rising diverse American mainstream,\u2019 he was speaking out against, among other things, \u2018the abject failure to clearly and forcefully denounce the actions of white supremacists, Neo-Nazis, and others who espouse racist and hateful views.\u2019\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe did not say whose abject failure it was, but he did not have to.

Young Storm is about to debut in a star-making role, giving little black girls everywhere\u2014hell, girls everywhere\u2014life and a heroine who\u2019s full of valor and grit (or strength, courage and wisdom, in India.Arie parlance) and set to save the world.

And I Sorely Regret It\u201d in the coming weeks and months. This week alone, we\u2019ve watched Fox News become of a bacchanalia of teary epiphany, and we\u2019ve witnessed a parade of prominent Republicans twist themselves into logical origami denouncing Donald Trump while defending the people who ... voted for Trump.\n\nAnyway, as far as this burgeoning genre of Trumpcab Confessions goes, Krein\u2019s piece hits each of the right notes. He remains sober as he methodically and meticulously articulates why he believed Trump was worthy of his support.\n\n\n\nRather than recite paeans to American enterprise, he acknowledged that our \u201cinformation economy\u201d has delivered little wage or productivity growth. He was willing to criticize the bipartisan consensus on trade and pointed out the devastating effects of deindustrialization felt in many communities. He forthrightly addressed the foreign policy failures of both parties, such as the debacles in Iraq and Libya, and rejected the utopian rhetoric of \u201cdemocracy promotion.\u201d He talked about the issue of widening income inequality \u2014 almost unheard of for a Republican candidate \u2014 and didn\u2019t pretend that simply cutting taxes or shrinking government would solve the problem. He criticized corporations for offshoring jobs, attacked financial-industry executives for avoiding taxes and bemoaned America\u2019s reliance on economic bubbles over the last few decades. He blasted the Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz campaigns for insincerely mouthing focus-grouped platitudes while catering to their largest donors \u2014 and he was right. Voters loved that he was willing to buck conventional wisdom and the establishment. He flouted G.O.P. orthodoxy on entitlements, infrastructure spending and, at times, even health care and \u201cculture war\u201d issues like funding Planned Parenthood. His statements on immigration were often needlessly inflammatory, but he correctly diagnosed that our current system makes little sense for most Americans, as well as many immigrants, and seems designed to benefit the wealthy at the expense of working people.\n\nHe then acknowledges the existence of Trump\u2019s lack of decorum and penchant for racially inflammatory remarks, while also explaining why he believed Trump was just a little rough around the edges\u2014edges he thought would eventually smooth.\n\n\n\nFrom the very start of his run, one of the most serious charges against Mr. Trump was that he panders to racists. Many of his supporters, myself included, managed to convince ourselves that his more outrageous comments \u2014 such as the Judge Gonzalo Curiel controversy or his initial hesitance to disavow David Duke\u2019s endorsement \u2014 were merely Bidenesque gaffes committed during the heat of a campaign.\n\nAnd then, after a few hundred words explaining why his initial support was justified, the piece shifts to unabashed penitence as Krein expresses his regret for such an egregious error in judgment.\n\nThose of us who supported Mr. Trump were never so na\u00efve as to expect that he would transform himself into a model of presidential decorum upon taking office. But our calculation was that a few cringe-inducing tweets were an acceptable trade-off for a successful governing agenda. Yet after more than 200 days in office, Mr. Trump\u2019s behavior grows only more reprehensible. Meanwhile, his administration has no significant legislative accomplishments \u2014 and no apparent plan to deliver any. Wilbur Ross\u2019s Commerce Department has advanced some sensible and appropriately incremental changes to trade policy, but no long-term agenda has been articulated. Senators Tom Cotton and David Perdue\u2019s recently proposed legislation offers a sound basis for reforming immigration policy, but seems to have no prospects and has received comparatively little attention. The administration inexplicably downgraded infrastructure and corporate tax reform \u2014 issues with potentially broad-based support \u2014 to pursue a warmed-over version of Paul Ryan\u2019s Obamacare repeal, which ended, predictably, in a humiliating failure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs long as this roving, flaming port-a-potty continues to roam through the White House, there will be more serious pieces in serious publications penned by serious men and serious women seriously explaining why they no longer believe in or support the (deadly unserious) man who they voted president. And they\u2019ll generally be met with praise for doing the right thing and applause for being so damn adult and allowing their minds to change. And they can all go fly a kite. Over \u201cFuck How You Feel Now\u201d Lake, sitting on the picturesque \u201cHere\u2019s A Fucking Cookie\u201d coast.\n\nIf there\u2019s anything even remotely good to say about Donald Trump, it\u2019s that he hasn\u2019t allowed his political success to change him. The person he is now is exactly the person he\u2019s been since we\u2019ve known who Donald Trump is. And although what has come from the White House in the months since the election could possibly be considered \u201csurprising,\u201d the election of Trump nullifies this particular type of surprise. Because he is exactly who he said he is. And exactly who we\u2014the people who didn\u2019t vote for him\u2014said he was.\n\nBeing surprised at Donald Trump\u2014surprised enough for his actions to change your opinions about him in less than a year\u2014is like placing a puppy on a carpet and getting surprised when he shits on it. And then getting mad at the puppy, who looks at you like, I\u2019M A FUCKING PUPPY! EATING AND SHITTING ON FURRY THINGS ARE MY TWO FAVORITE THINGS TO DO! WHAT THE HELL DID YOU THINK I WAS GONNA DO ON THIS CARPET?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet, despite the millions of people saying, \u201cNO, DON\u2019T PUT THAT PUPPY ON THE CARPET\u201d\u2014and despite this puppy literally saying, \u201cI WILL TOTALLY SHIT ON THAT CARPET, DUDE\u201d\u2014people like Krein chose to ignore them and now want some sort of laudatory fellatio for finally doing the right thing.

Telling the stories of black and brown people is what she was born to do.\n\nThe day after Donald J. Trump was elected president of the United States, stock in private prisons skyrocketed. As 1 out of every 4 prisoners in the world are incarcerated in America, and 1 in 3 black men can expect to go to prison in their lifetimes, the stock rise is chilling, especially for black and brown people living in the U.S. But what are the implications?\n\n\u201cIt means that everything that\u2019s predicted in the documentary \u2026 it\u2019s all going to come to pass,\u201d DuVernay told The Root.\n\nStill, the trailblazing filmmaker remains optimistic: \u201cStocks in private prison rose, but the fact that so many people know what that meant, and called it out, and had a context for what\u2019s happening denotes change.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAudience response is a reflection of that change. 13th has already won the Critics' Choice Documentary Awards, among others, and the film is also on the Oscar short list for best documentary, along with Not Your Negro and O.J.: Made in America. Making the short list will perhaps lead to a nomination (we'll find out Jan. 24), which, in turn, will lead to an Oscar.\n\nBut while this hypothetical win for DuVernay and 13th may offer hope, and mean that a change is gonna come to the academy after a few years of #OscarsSoWhite, DuVernay doesn't make films looking for awards or recognition. Filmmaking is her life's work. \u201cMy striving for excellence is divorced from anything I think will come out of it for me,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Root sat down with the prolific screenwriter and director to discuss 13th in the era of Trump, being the first African-American woman to direct a $100 million film (Disney's A Wrinkle in Time, slated for release in 2018) and the significance of an Oscar win.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFelice Le\u00f3n is multimedia editor at The Root.", "keywords": ["13th", "beauty", "short", "root", "trump", "magnifying", "work", "duvernay", "ava", "come", "slavery", "documentary", "lifes", "watch", "black", "stock"], "polarity": 0.08558429118773946, "subjectivity": 0.3417145593869732},

In newspaper and online newsrooms, they were 4.25 percent, according to the 2016 diversity survey of the American Society of News Editors [PDF]. That newsroom percentage more closely matched that of their share of the general population than the figures for African Americans, Latinos or Native Americans.\n\nAn abridged, sometimes paraphrased report of the conversation:\n\nJan: The Asian American voice does get lost in the fray. A lot of the hate is targeted at Muslims, Latinos and black people, though brown Asians, too, have been threatened and killed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKang: There\u2019s not much in the national conversation about Asian people. I don\u2019t even know what Asian means . . . I just don\u2019t think there\u2019s an identity.\n\nGuo: It\u2019s not a term we invented. [Some trace it to Yuji Ichioka, a pioneering San Francisco-born historian, in the late 1960s.]\n\nYou\u2019re not black and you\u2019re not white.If you\u2019re the kind of person \u2014 upwardly mobile, East Asian, who went to college, it\u2019s easier for you to assimilate into white culture. To pay attention to that kind of [racial] stuff doesn\u2019t endear you to the people writing the paycheck.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsian Americans have always been a part of the fabric of America; the Chinese helped build the transcontinental railroad. The story of Asian Americans is important because it is intricately tied with the story of race in America. Asians were used to define and constrict African Americans.\n\nKang: It\u2019s a very, very bad time to write about race. Everything has become so standardized. Too much of the writing is about representation in Hollywood. There\u2019s a lot of baked-in laziness. Some just don\u2019t know how to write about race. [Kang also mentions an anti-black history among Asians.]\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJan: I see my work as, \u201cif I weren\u2019t there, it wouldn\u2019t be told.\u201d\n\n\n\nGuo: We write, we speak English. I look at some of the foreign correspondents who write about China; they come out with these stories about China that are laughable. For example, recent stories about Chinese idolizing Ivanka Trump. It\u2019s like they\u2019re not seriously worshipping Ivanka Trump. It\u2019s like a joke. Asian people are having fun.\n\nStill, my parents are immigrants. I\u2019m not equipped to write about Cambodian refugees. My parents came in a plane, not a boat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI feel very conflicted. I do have a responsibility to tell these Asian stories, even if I don\u2019t have (the background), because who else is going to write these stories?\n\nJan: A good story is a good story. I recall being the only Asian American on a fellowship to China last month. There was so much negative coverage of the EB-5 visa program, [which grants green cards to foreigners who invest $500,000 in the United States. \u201cThe nearly three-decade-old program has come under new scrutiny in recent months, in part because of a sales pitch to Chinese investors by White House senior adviser Jared Kushner\u2019s family real estate business,\u201d Jan would write July 7 for the Post.] However, hardly anyone was writing about why the program was attractive to middle-class Chinese. So I did. We\u2019re missing a bunch of different stories.\n\nGuo: There is an assumption that there can be some neutral perspective. Isn\u2019t the \u201cneutral perspective\u201d often the white perspective?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKuo: I used to work in a foreign bureau in Hong Kong. A pet peeve of mine is how the stories were written as if to say, \u201cLook at how weird these people are.\u201d What frustrates you about race coverage?\n\nGuo: That is also a pet peeve of mine; when people approach coverage strictly from a cultural perspective, not considering the historical and economic background \u2014 such as stories about Japanese growing square watermelons that don\u2019t mention why.\n\nKang: It\u2019s preoccupation with pop culture. I thought people would stop caring about how many Oscars were awarded.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDeportation stories. Every deportation is exactly the same.

That revelation \u2015 along with a bizarre interview process, labeled \u2018death panels\u2019 by employees, in which copy editors were reportedly forced to justify their continued employment \u2015 led the desk to fire back at the company in an open letter to Executive Editor Dean Baquet and Managing Editor Joe Kahn on Wednesday:\n\n\u201c \u2018You turned your backs on us,\u2019 the letter read.\n\n\u201c \u2018We abhor your decision to wipe out the copy desk.

Grynbaum reported Thursday for the New York Times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut at a moment when the news media is increasingly fractured, the personal and crude nature of Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter remarks about Ms. Brzezinski, the co-host of MSNBC\u2019s \u2018Morning Joe,\u2019 proved to be an equal-opportunity stunner, sparking a backlash that spanned the news industry\u2019s usual divides.\n\n\u201cShortly before 9 a.m., Mr. Trump taunted Ms. Brzezinski and her co-host and fianc\u00e9, Joe Scarborough, as \u2018low I.Q. Crazy Mika, along with Psycho Joe\u2019 and described a meeting with Ms. Brzezinski in which, the president claimed, \u2018she was bleeding badly from a face-lift.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe coarseness of his remark \u2014 which echoed previous instances in which the president attacked prominent women, including the anchor Megyn Kelly and the Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina, about their physical appearance \u2014 drew rebukes even within the bulwarks of the Trump-friendly news media. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a follow-up Friday, Grynbaum reported, \u201cMr. Scarborough told his viewers that the White House had urged him to seek Mr. Trump\u2019s forgiveness for critical coverage, lest The [National] Enquirer, which is controlled by a Trump ally, run a story detailing his involvement with Ms. Brzezinski . . . .\u201dMr. Trump fired back on Twitter that it was Mr. Scarborough who asked him to quash the story. \u2018I said no!\u2019 the president wrote.\n\n\u201cThe bizarre back-and-forth, which has drawn blanket coverage on cable news, left Washington veterans stupefied. . . .\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Unprecedented Attack on Voting Rights\u2019\n\n\u201cFour things happened yesterday that pose a grave danger to voting rights,\u201d Ari Berman wrote Friday for the Nation.\n\n\u201c1. The House Appropriations Committee voted to defund the Election Assistance Commission, the only federal agency that helps states make sure their voting machines aren\u2019t hacked. . . .\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c2. The Department of Justice sent a letter to all 50 states informing them that \u2018we are reviewing voter registration list maintenance procedures in each state covered by the NVRA [National Voter Registration Act]\u2019 and asking how they plan to remove voters from the rolls. While this might sound banal, it\u2019s a clear instruction to states from the federal government to start purging the voting rolls. . . .\n\n\u201c3. The White House commission on election integrity, led by vice chair Kris Kobach, also sent a letter to 50 states asking them to provide sweeping voter data . . .\n\n\u201c4. The Trump administration named Hans von Spakovsky of the Heritage Foundation as a member of the commission, who\u2019s done more than anyone other than Kobach to spread the myth of voter fraud and enact suppressive policies. . . .\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAll four of these actions would be disturbing on their own, but taken together they represent an unprecedented attack on voting rights by the Trump administration and Republican Congress. The actions by Kobach, in particular, appear to mark the beginning of a nationwide voter-suppression campaign, based on spreading lies about voter fraud to justify enacting policies that purge the voter rolls, and make registration and voting more difficult. . . .\u201d\n\nOfficials from California to Mississippi called the commission\u2019s sweeping request for the personal and public data \u201can overreach and more than 20 states declared they would not comply,\u201d Michael Wines reported Friday for the New York Times.\n\nThe Pew Research Center reported Wednesday that 59 percent of respondents believe \u201cthat everything possible should be done to make it easy for every citizen to vote.\u201d At 79 percent, blacks agreed with the statement more than Hispanics, at 64 percent, and whites, 54 percent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCharles M.

So did the Justice Department, which on Wednesday declared the team the winner.\n\n\u201cThe Native Americans and the Justice Department didn\u2019t have much of a choice. On June 19, in a separate case involving an Asian rock band, the Supreme Court declared that a key section of federal law banning trademarks that \u2018may disparage\u2019 people was a violation of the First Amendment. It was this section of the 1946 Lanham Act that the Native Americans relied upon to argue that the Redskins should be stripped of its trademark registrations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut once the Supreme Court ruled that the disparagement clause was not constitutional, the Justice Department and the Native Americans, led by Amanda Blackhorse, a Navajo from Arizona, had little legal standing to move forward. . . .\u201d\n\nPublic Housing Called Enabler of Gang Violence\n\n\u201cThere have long been neighborhood gangs in Richmond,\u201d Ned Oliver wrote Sunday for the Richmond (Va.)

I used to [go] to IRE conferences when I was an investigative reporter, and I was the only reporter of color,\u201d he wrote, referring to Investigative Reporters & Editors. \u201cThat\u2019s probably changed some, or at least I hope it has.\u201d\n\nDoug Haddix, executive director of IRE, told Journal-isms by email, \u201cI think it\u2019s changed and continues to improve. IRE has ongoing partnerships with organizations such as NABJ, NAHJ, AAJA and the Ida B. Wells Society for training and resources,\u201d referring to the national associations of black, Hispanic and Asian American journalists and the recently formed society for journalists of color furthering investigative reporting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe provide diversity fellowships and scholarships to our conferences and data bootcamps. We actively work to ensure diversity on panels at our national conferences. And our keynote speaker at this year\u2019s national IRE conference is Nikole Hannah-Jones of the New York Times Magazine.\n\n\u201cSo, yes, IRE has made progress over the years. We recognize that we still have a lot of work to do, and are eager to partner with anyone who can help us ensure that our organization reflects the broad diversity in our industry and society as a whole.\u201d\n\nOutside of the investigative pieces, other reporters of color, such as Abby Phillip of the Post, Rebecca R. Ruiz of the Times and Jeff Pegues of CBS News, have reported parts of the larger story.

Wilkins, an editorial writer there in the 1970s, was \u201ca father confessor and an adviser,\u201d Charlayne Hunter-Gault, a former Times reporter, told about 350 people gathered to remember Wilkins Saturday in Washington.\n\nTo his colleagues in the \u201cFree South Africa\u201d anti-apartheid movement of the 1980s, Wilkins was \u201ca vital link between many, many communities,\u201d one who \u201cknew people who knew people,\u201d according to Cicely Counts, a fellow activist in that cause.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilkins was familiar to the District of Columbia police tasked with arresting the demonstrators during those \u201880s sit-ins. But Wilkins was also the man who could arrange a plane to shuttle Nelson Mandela to welcoming crowds in the United States after South Africa freed him in 1990, so he wouldn\u2019t have to travel by bus.\n\nWilkins died on March 26 at 75 of complications from dementia. In the program for the memorial service, held at Sidwell Friends School, he was introduced as \u201ca man of moral vision, statesman, journalist, writer, leader, professor, organizer, father, husband, and friend.\u201d\n\nJack R. Censer, dean of the College of Humanities and Human Sciences at George Mason University, where Wilkins taught history for 20 years starting in 1987, said \u201cthe students adored him.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis youngest daughter, Elizabeth Wilkins, recalled a dad who could be silly with her. They played a recurring game to see who could first tap the other and say \u201cBONG!\u201d\n\nWilkins\u2019 appeal crossed racial divides, with the memorial service audience about 60 percent white. A few of the mourners, such as Eleanor Holmes Norton, the D.C. delegate to Congress, were among 380 people who that morning attended a service for Eddie N. Williams, longtime president of the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, the African American think tank.\n\nRemembering her days at the Times with Wilkins, Hunter-Gault spoke about sessions at Sardi\u2019s, a watering hole near the Times building, where frustrated black Times journalists could talk with Wilkins over \u201csnacks.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHunter-Gault received pushback in the early \u201870s when she urged the Times to adapt to changing tastes and use \u201cblack\u201d instead of \u201cNegro.\u201d Wilkins told her to \u201chang in there,\u201d and eventually her position prevailed.\n\nLena Williams was struggling as a Times intern who was repeatedly passed over while white journalists in her position were being promoted. \u201cShe was thinking of going somewhere else,\u201d Hunter-Gault said. \u201cRoger said he didn\u2019t suffer fools or indignities gladly, and urged her to do the same.\u201d Williams remained and went on to become a sports reporter.\n\nWilkins knew he was valued highly by management, and so he signed on to a lawsuit in support of blacks who claimed discrimination. As expected, management took the suit more seriously, and a settlement was reached shortly before trial was to begin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEven today, some of those struggles continue,\u201d Hunter-Gault said. \u201cI\u2019m so proud to find a younger generation of journalists delving into black history. Roger Wilkins is one of the giants on whose shoulders they stand.\u201d\n\n. . . \u2018Tried to Educate\u2019 Washington Post Editor\n\nBefore Roger Wilkins joined the New York Times, he was an editorial writer at the Washington Post, where his editorials during Watergate helped earn the Post the 1973 Pulitzer Prize for public service.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilkins was also supportive of the Metro Seven, young black Metro desk reporters (including this columnist) who filed a discrimination complaint against the Post in 1972 before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\n\nNick Kotz (pictured left), a National desk reporter at the time, recalled Wilkins\u2019 involvement in an email to Journal-isms on Monday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cRoger Wilkins, who was on the editorial staff, and I on the national staff in the early 1970s, talked often about what was going on in your fight and how various of us might try to help.\n\n\u201cOne subject was the silence of the National staff and of the editorial staff.\n\n\u201cSo at some point, I asked reporters on the national staff to have an informal dinner meeting after work at a nearby restaurant to talk about the issue and the need for us to take a stand. About 8 to 10 of us met.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut before we did anything more than talk, [Executive Editor Benjamin C.] Bradlee heard about the dinner, and let me and others know of his displeasure that we were meddling in something that was none of our business.\n\n\u201cAlmost immediately, however, Bradlee did appoint a group of reporters and editors headed by Bill Greider, to advise him about discrimination in the newsroom. I don\u2019t know what came out of that group.\n\n\u201cRoger, a \u2018social friend\u2019 of Bradlee, constantly tried \u2018to educate him.\u2019 Beyond question, it was the lawsuit and your tenacity that finally got some results.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[Greider adds to the story in an email:\n\n[\u201dBradlee in the early 70s finally realizes the issue of racial inequality (even for white women!!) was not going away and so he appoints a newsroom committee peopled with six or eight well-known bleeding hearts, myself included. I had long hair and a swarthy look, some colleagues thought I was an Indian.\n\n[\u201dI wish I could remember all the names but I think I was the nominal chair. We met under the auspices of an asst managing editor (whose name was actually Robert E. Lee [Baker] but he was a serious good guy who encouraged us to do serious stuff but adroitly). We met every few months and began with obvious easy stuff. Get some facts. We persuaded the editors to produce a survey of the newsroom which naturally shocked and embarrassed management (briefly).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[\u201dThen [Baker] either retired or got a different assignment. He was replaced with a stiff-necked old-school company hack and she just sat on us. After a few months of futility, I proposed that we expose the charade by resigning en masse. Everyone on the committee agreed. It was a yawn in the newsroom.\n\n[\u201dIt might have ended there except for Peggy Cafritz who was then a TV reporter at WTOP (then owned by the Wash Post). She decided to do a piece on this pro-integration liberal newspaper and was interviewing editors and reporters [for a an hour-long docuentary on professional personnel, Cafritz says.] When she got to me \u2014 wonder of wonders \u2014 I just told her the truth. About the failed committee and our meek little rebellion. She did a good straight piece. on integration at the Wash Post and, who knows, maybe our pitiful little committee had some impact once it was defunct. . . .]\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKotz continued, \u201cRoger was a powerful voice for justice and decency in so many ways. We met at the Gridiron dinner in 1970 and became lifetime friends. After that dinner, we drank and talked through the night, both of us incredulous and angry at a piano duet performed by President Nixon and Vice President Agnew and the reaction of the all-white (except for Roger and [District of Columbia] Mayor [Walter E.] Washington) crowd of journalists and leaders from politics and business.\n\n\u201cNixon and Agnew played \u2018Dixie\u2019 \u2014 a symbol of their racist \u2018southern strategy\u2019 that probably was instrumental in their winning the 1968 election, and the audience roared with laughter. Roger and I, and hopefully others, were not amused.\n\n\n\n\u201cNot long after the dinner, Roger wrote an op-ed for the Post with the headline \u201cA Black at the Gridiron Dinner.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHis passion and eloquence in that piece led to his newspaper career first at the Post and then at the NYT.\u201d\n\nDavid W.

Times\u2019 Public Editor Decries \u2018Overall Scarcity\u2019\n\n\u201cThe Swiss psychiatrist Hermann Rorschach, acclaimed for his study of inkblots, might have enjoyed doing some field work at the most recent newsroom-wide meeting of The New York Times,\u201d Liz Spayd, public editor at the Times, wrote on Saturday for its SundayReview section.\n\n\u201cMany in the audience saw before them top editors representing a bold new phase of digital innovation. Others, especially some women, saw a reality grounded firmly in the present: an all-male cast at the podium, the chief architects behind the most important strategic document since the celebrated innovation report in 2014. Was this a portrait of a newsroom\u2019s future or of the gender that will remain in charge of it?\n\n\u201cOne or both may be correct. But the optics that day highlight a piercing problem at The Times. Women have skidded down the power structure since Jill Abramson was dismissed as executive editor three years ago, with fewer females leading big news departments and fewer coming up the pipeline. Thus, fewer women decide what big stories are assigned, what broad coverage priorities are set, and what a re-envisioned Times should look like.\n\n\u201cJust how grave the problem is depends, as with inkblots, on one\u2019s perspective.\n\n\u201cIn recent weeks, for example, three women were added to the masthead, placing them in the coveted ranks of the newsroom\u2019s top editors. In addition, women head up the Washington bureau, the arts and culture coverage, the book, photo and video desks, as well as several smaller sections. There are probably more distinguished women in this newsroom than at most any newspaper in the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo where\u2019s the grievance? For one, men are No. 1 and No. 2 in command for the first time in 14 years, Dean Baquet as executive editor and Joseph Kahn as the recently named managing editor. Another male is first among equals driving coverage in the ranks below them, while men run the paper\u2019s national news, foreign news and metropolitan news, as well as both business and sports. The next editing tier is also heavily male, a climate that led one group of women to wryly fantasize one day about how differently a story might read if no man touched it throughout the editing chain. . . .\u201d\n\nSpayd also wrote, \u201cThe overall scarcity of women may contribute to the persistent complaints from readers who see a sexist tinge to elements of the news coverage. . . .\u201d\n\nSpayd wrote in December about \u201cThe newsroom\u2019s blinding whiteness.\u201d\n\nCara Bahniuk, russianmachineneverbreaks.com: The Washington Post is the only newspaper in the world to have four major sport beats covered by women\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBiracial People Called Best Suited for the Future\n\n\u201cAfter the nation\u2019s first black president, we now have a white president with the whitest and malest cabinet since Ronald Reagan\u2019s,\u201d Moises Velasquez-Manoff wrote Saturday in the featured article in the New York Times SundayReview. \u201cHis administration immediately made it a priority to deport undocumented immigrants and to deny people from certain Muslim-majority nations entry into the United States, decisions that caused tremendous blowback.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat President Trump doesn\u2019t seem to have considered is that diversity doesn\u2019t just sound nice, it has tangible value. Social scientists find that homogeneous groups like his cabinet can be less creative and insightful than diverse ones. They are more prone to groupthink and less likely to question faulty assumptions.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s true of groups is also true for individuals. A small but growing body of research suggests that multiracial people are more open-minded and creative. . . .\u201d\n\nVelasquez-Manoff also wrote, \u201cAs a multiethnic person myself \u2014 the son of a Jewish dad of Eastern European descent and a Puerto Rican mom \u2014 I can attest that being mixed makes it harder to fall back on the tribal identities that have guided so much of human history, and that are now resurgent. Your background pushes you to construct a worldview that transcends the tribal. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome Caution Outrage Over Trump May Go Too Far\n\nA New York Times editorial Sunday captured the sentiment of most mainstream journalists\u2019 professional reaction to President Trump\u2019s unsubstantiated, tweeted allegation that former president Barack Obama tapped Trump\u2019s phones. But other journalists wrote that some of their colleagues had gone too far.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s begin with what the public can know for certain,\u201d the Times wrote. \u201cPresident Trump had no evidence on Saturday morning when he smeared his predecessor, President Barack Obama, accusing him of ordering that Trump Tower phones be tapped during the 2016 campaign. Otherwise, the White House would not be scrambling to find out if what he said is true.\n\n\u201cJust contemplate the recklessness \u2014 the sheer indifference to truth and the moral authority of the American presidency \u2014 revealed here: one president baselessly charging criminality by another, all in a childish Twitter rampage.\n\n\u201cThe Times reported on Sunday that the F.B.I. director, James Comey, was so alarmed by Mr. Trump\u2019s fact-free claim \u2014 which implicitly accused the F.B.I. of breaking the law by wiretapping an American citizen at a president\u2019s behest \u2014 that he was asking the Justice Department to publicly call it false. In other words, the F.B.I. director was demanding that Justice officially declare the president to be misleading the public.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis is a dangerous moment, which requires Congress and members of this administration to look beyond partisan maneuvering and tend to the health of the democracy itself. . . .\u201d\n\nHowever, Harold Jackson, editorial page editor of the Philadelphia Inquirer, worried on Sunday about comparisons of Trump with another authoritarian personality: \u201cComparisons of President Trump and his cabinet with Adolf Hitler and his regime are counterproductive exercises in hyperbole that make political division in this country worse. If anything, such comparisons indicate too many Americans never learned in school how Nazism kept its vise grip on Germany in the early 20th century. . . .\u201d\n\nDavid Zurawik of the Baltimore Sun wrote Saturday, \u201cIn fairness to Trump, his administration has not escalated the conflict with the press to a new level. It has not yet come close to doing what President Obama\u2019s administration did in making the act of reporting itself criminal behavior in a case that started in 2009 under the Espionage Act of 1917. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nZurawik referred to the case of James Rosen, chief Washington correspondent for Fox News, branded in court documents by the Justice Department as \u201can aider, abettor and/or co-conspirator,\u201d and to the exclusion of Fox News from a round of interviews in 2009 with Kenneth Feinberg, then a Treasury Department official.\n\nDisinformation Found to Play Role in Campaign\n\n\u201cThe 2016 Presidential election shook the foundations of American politics,\u201d Yochai Benkler, Robert Faris, Hal Roberts and Ethan Zuckerman wrote Friday for Columbia Journalism Review. \u201cMedia reports immediately looked for external disruption to explain the unanticipated victory \u2014 with theories ranging from Russian hacking to \u2018fake news.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe have a less exotic, but perhaps more disconcerting explanation: Our own study of over 1.25 million stories published online between April 1, 2015 and Election Day shows that a right-wing media network anchored around Breitbart developed as a distinct and insulated media system, using social media as a backbone to transmit a hyper-partisan perspective to the world.\n\n\u201cThis pro-Trump media sphere appears to have not only successfully set the agenda for the conservative media sphere, but also strongly influenced the broader media agenda, in particular coverage of Hillary Clinton.\n\n\u201cWhile concerns about political and media polarization online are longstanding, our study suggests that polarization was asymmetric. Pro-Clinton audiences were highly attentive to traditional media outlets, which continued to be the most prominent outlets across the public sphere, alongside more left-oriented online sites. But pro-Trump audiences paid the majority of their attention to polarized outlets that have developed recently, many of them only since the 2008 election season.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAttacks on the integrity and professionalism of opposing media were also a central theme of right-wing media. Rather than \u2018fake news\u2019 in the sense of wholly fabricated falsities, many of the most-shared stories can more accurately be understood as disinformation . . . .\u201d\n\nTrump Cuts Back on CNN, MSNBC, \u2018Morning Joe\u2019\n\n\u201cIn a story about the ratings gains for the cable news channels during Pres. Trump\u2019s First 100 days, Bloomberg got a sense of the Commander-in-Chief\u2019s TV news viewing habits,\u201d Chris Ariens wrote Friday for TV Newser. \u201cWe know he\u2019s a Fox News fan, but also this:\n\n\u201c \u2018Trump has cut back how much he watches CNN and MSNBC in recent weeks, having sworn off the latter network\u2019s \u2018Morning Joe\u2019 after criticism from its hosts, according to a senior White House aide privy to the president\u2019s viewing habits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cInstead, the president now spends hours some mornings watching Fox News, switching occasionally to CNBC for business headlines, along with a daily diet of newspapers and press clippings, said the official, who asked not to be identified discussing private information.

Counties in another 28 states also routinely engage in the practice. These costs are often crippling to families already struggling with poverty and with the trauma of seeing a son or daughter in jail.\n\n\u201cParents are charged even if the case against their child is ultimately dismissed. For example, when Mariana Cuevas\u2019s son was released from a California jail after being locked up in a juvenile hall for more than 300 days for a homicide he did not commit, the state still tried to collect $10,000 for his imprisonment.\n\n\u201cThe City of Philadelphia, where the story was focused, announced a few hours after our story was published that it would end the practice of charging parents who have kids in detention.

Reporters Gary Rotstein and Tim Grant described several trends affecting the black community here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOne trend is that many African-American professionals do not feel comfortable here, and they lack a cohesive peer group.

According to a USA Today analysis of census data, Pittsburgh is experiencing a net loss of 614 African-Americans each year.\n\n\u201cA second trend is that blacks who live here often face barriers in joining the professional class; few have become business owners or leaders in their fields of work.

Exhume those stories,\u2019 Davis said, thanking \u2018Fences\u2019 playwright and Pulitzer Prize-winner August Wilson for exhuming and exalting ordinary people in his work.\n\n\u201cSomehow, Davis managed to capture what would become a recurring theme of the evening, as Black actors, writers, and filmmakers made history during the ceremony.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was the first year where more than three Black Oscar winners took the stage for the marquee categories \u2014 writing, acting, and directing. . . .\u201d\n\nNearly everyone knows what gave Sunday\u2019s telecast its biggest headlines. As Maria Puente and Andrea Mandell wrote Monday for USA Today, \u201cThe accountants did it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all watched in shock as it happened. Now we know exactly what happened.\n\n\u201cPricewaterhouseCoopers, which has handled the accounting for the Academy Awards since 1934, early Monday apologized for giving the wrong envelope to presenters Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway before the two actors erroneously announced La La Land as best picture at Sunday night\u2019s Oscars. In actuality, Moonlight won the top prize. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut of course that wasn\u2019t the only story. Other takeaways were influenced by ethnic, sexual or workplace perspectives.\n\nThe Boricua Film Club wrote Friday for the National Institute for Latino Policy, \u201cIn what many are referring to #OscarsSoBlack in contrast to last year\u2019s #OscarSoWhite protest, Latinos were once again almost invisible in this year\u2019s Academy Awards. No Latinos were nominated for any roles, none of the nominated films had any Latino content as far as we can tell, and there weren\u2019t even that many Latinos as presenters! . . .\u201d\n\nIn contrast, Ed Diokno wrote Monday for AsAmNews, \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing that I wasn\u2019t playing the drinking game during the Oscars telecast last night. You know, every time an Asian appeared, drink a shot of scotch. With the number of Asian appearances, I might be so incapacitated that I wouldn\u2019t be able to write this post. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnder the headline \u201cAuthentic Stories About Native Americans Need Hollywood\u2019s Attention,\u201d Chris Eyre, Joely Proudfit and Heather Rathree wrote Friday in Variety, \u201cFilm and TV have always been powerful weapons against Native people, whether it be negative portrayals that reinforce Manifest Destiny-derived mythologies or lack of representation overall. . . .\n\n\u201cThat was why we founded The Native Networkers (TNN) in 2015, with a mission to provide resources to the industry that help foster more authentic representation of Native American and Indigenous peoples. Unlike traditional consultants, we collaborate with filmmakers and bridge subject matter at all stages of development, production, and distribution. . . .\u201d\n\nEven journalists had skin in the game. \u201cThe New York Times is running its first television ad in seven years during the Oscars Sunday night. The subject? The truth,\u201d Frank Pallotta reported Thursday for CNN.\n\nThe New York Times launched its new marketing campaign, \u201cThe Truth Is Hard,\u201d during Sunday\u2019s Academy Awards show. (video)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe ad begins with voices saying, \u2018The truth is our nation is more divided than ever,\u2019 with those words spelled out against a white backdrop. The phrase then changes to \u2018The truth is alternative facts are lies.\u2019 The ad repeats different versions of the \u2018The truth is...\u2019 as the voices speed up and get louder. It ends with: \u2018The truth is hard\u2019 and \u2018The truth is more important now than ever.\u2019 . . .\u201d\n\nPresident Trump responded to that with a tweet early Sunday, \u201cFor first time the failing @nytimes will take an ad (a bad one) to help save its failing reputation. Try reporting accurately & fairly!\u201d\n\nSting performed \u201cThe Empty Chair,\u201d which he wrote with J. Ralph for the documentary film \u201cJim: The James Foley Story.\u201d The film tells the story of journalist Foley, who was killed by ISIS in 2014.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSting performed the song solo with just his guitar and a stark backdrop with a poignant quote from Foley that read, \u2018If I don\u2019t have the moral courage to challenge authority, we don\u2019t have journalism,\u2019 \u201d Madison Vein reported Sunday for Entertainment Weekly.\n\nWhen \u201cMoonlight\u201d won for Best Adapted Screenplay, Barry Jenkins and co-writer Tarell Alvin McCraney used their platform to give the \u201cblack and brown boys and girls and non-gender conforming who don\u2019t see themselves\u201d a shout-out while reflecting on their own histories growing up in Miami, where the film is set,\u201d as Jess Denham reported Tuesday for London\u2019s Independent.\n\n\u201cFor all you people out there who feel there is no mirror for you, that you feel your life is not reflected, the Academy has your back, the ACLU has your back, we have your back, and for the next four years we will not leave you alone, we will not forget you,\u201d said Jenkins.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat resonated with those whose identities fit the category, some of them journalists.\n\nGerrick D. Kennedy, pop music writer for the Los Angeles Times, tweeted, \u201cAnd right now I\u2019m sobbing hysterically. I\u2019ll be 30 this year.

Grynbaum reported Saturday for the New York Times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhether the New England-bred spokesman realizes it or not, the expression is perhaps less an insult than a reminder of an era when Donald J. Trump mastered the New York tabloid terrain \u2014 and his own narrative \u2014 shaping his image with a combination of on-the-record bluster and off-the-record gossip.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not in Manhattan anymore. This New York-iest of politicians, now an idiosyncratic, write-your-own-rules president, has stumbled into the most conventional of Washington traps: believing he can master an entrenched political press corps with far deeper connections to the permanent government of federal law enforcement and executive department officials than he has. . . .\u201d\n\nThrush and Grynbaum also wrote, \u201c \u2018New York is extremely intense and competitive, but it is actually a much smaller pond than Washington, where you have many more players with access to many more sources,\u2019 said Howard Wolfson, who has split his career between New York and Washington, advising former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c \u2018In New York, you can create a manageable set of relationships in a smaller universe,\u2019 Mr. Wolfson said. \u2018In Washington, that becomes a lot more complicated.\u2019\n\n\u201cThere is another fundamental difference: During his Page Six days, Mr. Trump was, by and large, trafficking in trivia. As president, he is dealing with the most serious issues of the day. They involve the nation\u2019s safety and prosperity, and it is the role of news organizations to cover them. . . .\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, in the wake of the White House\u2019s decision to bar disfavored news outlets from a briefing on Friday, \u201cThe Washington Post has added a new motto to its [website] front page: \u2018Democracy Dies in Darkness.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAnd the L.A. Times has printed up T-shirts, for staff and the public, with the phrase \u2018We will not shut up\u2019 in thirteen languages,\u201d Evan Osnos reported Saturday for the New Yorker.

We want to better understand the nature of trust in news, and we think the best way to go about it is to connect them with journalists in their own communities.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy for them to rail about crooked media in general. Just like it\u2019s easy for journalists to write off the complaints and concerns of their detractors.

Nor was I prepared when I called home and my mom told me that she was going to exchange cash for gold in case \u2018things get worse\u2019 and that my dad \u2014 who has never considered shooting anything in his life \u2014 had wondered out loud about getting a gun.\n\n\n\n\u201cI wanted to say, \u2018You\u2019re overreacting.\u2019 But I can\u2019t, really, in part because it\u2019s so hard to gauge the threat. Data on hate crimes \u2014 against Jews and everyone else \u2014 is miserably incomplete and poorly tracked. My job is about presenting facts to contextualize the news of the day, horrible as it may be. This time, I had to tell my family that I didn\u2019t have them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know if the vandalism at Chesed Shel Emeth was technically a hate crime. The motives behind it may well be uncovered. What we do know is that there is a long tradition of desecrating Jewish cemeteries, from Nazi Germany to present-day France and New York. And whatever the particulars, the news hit at a time when the Jewish community has been put on edge by threats to Jewish community centers where kids go to preschool and their retired grandparents take Kabbalah-infused yoga classes.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why our project, \u2018Documenting Hate,\u2019 an attempt to create a reliable database of hate crimes and bias incidents, asks victims to submit their stories. When I read the submissions, it\u2019s clear that defining \u2018hate crimes\u2019 can be as elusive as reliable data tracking them. It\u2019s just as clear that we need to make the attempt to define them, report them, investigate them \u2014 to gather enough, at least, for context.\n\n\u201cYes, it\u2019s about confronting the ugliness and comforting the scared.

I love them so much that I have two pairs: the wine-and-navy-blue \u201cNew Heights\u201d colorway and the black \u201cMetallic Gold\u201d colorway. They go with everything, and the fit is comfortable enough (and they\u2019re light enough) that I don\u2019t actually feel like I\u2019m wearing basketball shoes.\n\nAnd I\u2019m not much of a basketball-shoe fan in general. I own two pairs of Jordans\u2014they\u2019re both Jordan 1s\u2014and the rest of my shoes are running shoes, casual shoes or boots. Even buying these LeBrons took a while, since, again, I\u2019m not big on basketball shoes and I\u2019ve always found his to look rather bulky on display in stores.\n\nBut one day I was in Foot Locker\u2019s House of Hoops section, and I saw the New Heights XVs sitting on display. I thought they looked interesting, but they also looked pretty unflattering. That day I kept it moving, but the shoes stayed in the back of my mind.\n\nThat\u2019s how I end up buying most of the shoes I like: They stay on my mind. I rarely buy shoes the first time I see them. But if I can\u2019t shake the idea that I want them, I\u2019ll typically go back. I returned to Foot Locker to check them out on every trip to the mall but was still unconvinced that they were shoes I needed to own.\n\nI follow LeBron on Instagram, and there are tons of pictures of his shoes on his feed. The vast majority of them didn\u2019t get me. But there was one picture I saw where he was standing against a car dressed in street clothes, wearing something similar enough to what I\u2019d wear, and he had on his shoes; they looked awesome.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt that point, I decided that I was going to go try them on. Even though I found them unremarkable on display, seeing them on his feet (even through the \u2019gram) rocketed my passing interest to coveting.\n\nSo I went to the store, tried them on and realized, \u201cOh, sweet Jesus\u2014these joints are beauuuutiful on my feet.\u201d Perhaps it\u2019s hyperbolic, but I loved how they looked. I plopped down my money with a smile on my face, feeling ecstatic to separate myself from my hard-earned $196.10 (including tax).\n\nAfter wearing them out, a funny thing started to happen: Several dudes told me that seeing them on somebody convinced them that the shoes were actually pretty fly. It seems that I wasn\u2019t the only one struggling with whether the XVs were dope or not. Some folks were going to buy them because they\u2019re LeBrons. Others are sneakerheads, and while I\u2019m a fringe sneakerhead, I have no idea if the XVs were a hype-beast shoe of choice. But many of us were looking at them in stores and just unconvinced of their potential. But seeing them on my feet changed the game for some people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s happened at least five times. The latest was at a baby shower I attended this past weekend. I threw on the black XVs, and while I was walking around snapping pictures of the event, a friend of mine stopped me and said, \u201cYou\u2019ve convinced me.\u201d I asked him what he was talking about, and he pointed at my feet and said he\u2019d been on the fence, but seeing them on my feet persuaded him that he should cop them.\n\nIt happened at a nightclub once as well. I was walking around minding my business when two dudes walked up to me and said something very similar\u2014that on display, the XVs just don\u2019t look that dope, so they hadn\u2019t even thought to try them on until they peeped them on my feet. Happened at brunch once and randomly at a restaurant bar while I was eating lunch\u2014on the street once, too. It seems that LeBron\u2019s XVs are the ultimate in deceptively fly.\n\nIf you\u2019re into shoes at all, you\u2019re going to pay attention to them. You may hate them, but you will notice them, and I even imagine it\u2019s hard to hate them because they\u2019re so distinctive. The shoes are made of \u201cBattleKnit,\u201d a Flyknit-weave take on the Flyknit material that so many running shoes are currently made of, with the very popular \u201csock\u201d styling that\u2019s all over the sneaker market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey have a look to them, but in stores they look oddly shaped at best. And even on LeBron\u2019s feet in the games\u2014there are tons of pictures featuring his shoes\u2014they didn\u2019t sway me one way or another. And while GQ called the shoes as cool as LeBron is, I was still skeptical.\n\nNope\u2014it took seeing them on LeBron\u2019s feet in a picture of him doing regular shit (and other people complimenting them in everyday wear) for me to realize how awesome they are from a fashion standpoint, and now they\u2019re my go-to shoe for everything from church to picking up hog maws.\n\nI\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t \u201cpass\u201d on these shoes. Get it? Pass. Because LeBron likes to ... pass the ball?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019ll see myself out.", "keywords": ["right", "theyre", "shoes", "seeing", "im", "favorite", "apparently", "look", "nike", "feet", "lebron", "xvs", "lebrons", "looked", "skeptical"], "polarity": 0.14941289224871313, "subjectivity": 0.5803408863110355},

If you voted for a man who campaigned on xenophobia, racism, sexism and other strains of bigotry, you either share his prejudices or you are complicit in them. The former makes you an audacious racist; the latter, a bystander, which in and of itself is a racist act. Nothing about that reality has changed since Habanero Hitler was declared the winner of the 2016 presidential election or officially sworn in to office.\n\n\n\nBut in senseless fashion, some continue to advocate on behalf of the big basket of deplorables responsible for the ongoing mess that is the 45th president of the United States. Only a week ago, I asked how many more of these disingenuous and intellectually dishonest diatribes will we collectively be subjected to? The\n\nNew York Times swiftly flew in with an answer: to infinity and fucking beyond.\n\n\n\nIn the news analysis \u201cAre Liberals Helping Trump?\u201d Sabrina Tavernise, a national correspondent for the Times, echoes all of the greatest hits associated with any defense of 45\u2019s supporters.\n\nFirst, there is the introduction of the 45 voter, who in this case is Jeffrey Medford, \u201ca small-business owner in South Carolina\u201d who apparently \u201cvoted reluctantly for Donald Trump.\u201d Next we get his rationale for helping to elect a monster who is presently trying to reintroduce a travel ban aimed at people from primarily Muslim countries while stripping protection of transgender children in public schools. For Medford, it was the sentiment that \u201cas a conservative, he felt the need to choose the Republican.\u201d\n\nThen comes the bullshit: the idea that assigning culpability is cruel and unjust, not to mention the cries of victimhood. Tavernise argues:\n\n\n\nMr. Medford should be a natural ally for liberals trying to convince the country that Mr. Trump was a bad choice. But it is not working out that way. Every time Mr. Medford dips into the political debate\u2014either with strangers on Facebook or friends in New York and Los Angeles\u2014he comes away feeling battered by contempt and an attitude of moral superiority. \u201cWe\u2019re backed into a corner,\u201d said Mr. Medford, 46, whose business teaches people to be filmmakers. \u201cThere are at least some things about Trump I find to be defensible. But they are saying: \u2018Agree with us 100 percent or you are morally bankrupt. You\u2019re an idiot if you support any part of Trump.\u2019 \u201d He added: \u201cI didn\u2019t choose a side. They put me on one.\u201d\n\nHow ironic that a supporter of a man who campaigned on absolutes like \u201cbuild a wall\u201d and \u201cMuslim ban\u201d suddenly longs for nuance and gray areas. In any event, Tavernise paints a picture that likely resonates with the likes of the Washington Post\u2019s Chris Cillizza, who once tweeted, \u201cThe assumption that \u2018Trump voter = racist\u2019 is deeply corrosive to democracy.\u201d Cillizza went on to add, \u201cThere is nothing more maddening\u2014and counterproductive\u2014to me than saying that Trump\u2019s 59 million votes were all racist. Ridiculous.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe same goes for the former host of The Daily Show, Jon Stewart, who, in an interview with Charlie Rose on CBS This Morning shortly after the election, argued:\n\n\n\nI thought Donald Trump disqualified himself at numerous points. But there is now this idea that anyone who voted for him is\u2014has to be defined by the worst of his rhetoric. Like, there are guys in my neighborhood that I love, that I respect, that I think have incredible qualities, who are not afraid of Mexicans and not afraid of Muslims and not afraid of blacks. They\u2019re afraid of their insurance premiums.\n\nMany of those people are presently screaming at Republican members of Congress at various town halls across the country. Their anger is understandable until you realize that they voted for someone who vowed on the campaign trail to repeal their health care program. Regardless of their purported motivation, though, Mexicans, Muslims and blacks were rightly fearful of their choice for president\u2014and their support shows that we were expendable. They may not have been afraid, but they rejected their own humanity when they voted for a man who categorized one group as rapists, the other as terrorists, and the last as folks who live in war zones in this country in desperate need of law and order.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRemember, though: It\u2019s wrong to highlight what their votes meant for the rest of us.\n\n\n\nTavernise writes:\n\n\n\nLiberals may feel energized by a surge in political activism, and a unified stance against a president they see as irresponsible and even dangerous. But that momentum is provoking an equal and opposite reaction on the right. In recent interviews, conservative voters said they felt assaulted by what they said was a kind of moral Bolshevism\u2014the belief that the liberal vision for the country was the only right one. Disagreeing meant being publicly shamed. Protests and righteous indignation on social media and in Hollywood may seem to liberals to be about policy and persuasion. But moderate conservatives say they are having the opposite effect, chipping away at their middle ground and pushing them closer to Mr. Trump. \u201cThe name calling from the left is crazy,\u201d said Bryce Youngquist, 34, who works in sales for a tech start-up in Mountain View, Calif., a liberal enclave where admitting you voted for Mr. Trump is a little like saying in the 1950s that you were gay. \u201cThey are complaining that Trump calls people names, but they turned into some mean people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo her credit, Tavernise\u2019s article is not like the other various op-eds that have flooded the New York Times opinion section in that she is not forcefully presenting a point of view. Even so, her analysis fits right in with the bevy of other pieces trying to absolve 45 supporters of their sins. Her essay is as exhausting a read as all the others. Like, say, another New York Times op-ed, entitled, \u201cSorry, Liberals. Bigotry Didn\u2019t Elect Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nHad Hillary Clinton campaigned just a little bit more in Detroit, Milwaukee and Philadelphia, the 70,000 or so votes she lost in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania would have made her president. There\u2019s also the fact that had the Democratic Party itself pushed back harder on voter suppression in those three states and other states, perhaps the party wouldn\u2019t be in as dismal a state as it currently finds itself in. And though \u201cshoulda, coulda, woulda\u201d doesn\u2019t mean much in hindsight, had Clinton won, I highly doubt that the black women who would have carried her into history would be getting as much attention as those who voted for a man nearly 3 million behind in the popular vote.\n\nWhere are the essays advocating on their behalf? What about the trans kids and adults who live in fear? What about those, like me, who constantly wonder what an Attorney General Jeff Sessions means for our safety and the remnants of our so-called rights and liberties? What about the millions of undocumented workers of Latino, African and Asian descent who have already started being practically hunted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll of this is happening, and mainstream publications are interviewing 45\u2019s supporters who bitch and moan about not being able to enjoy Meryl Streep movies and social media anymore? To hell with those people, and to hell with these attempts to run filters through the ugliness of their actions. They are not the only people who exist in this country.\n\nPerhaps some of these publications believe that if they behave like 45 and center white people and whiteness, they, too, can thrive. If that is the case, may they enjoy the same level of failure to which he is doomed. They all have it coming.\n\n", "keywords": ["voted", "york", "times", "medford", "damn", "need", "president", "mr", "deplorables", "racist", "trump", "basket", "afraid", "man", "defenses"], "polarity": 0.007933261183261183, "subjectivity": 0.4651277056277056},

(Credit: ABC News)\n\nHow Supremacist Trolls Spread Rumors to Media\n\n\u201cFollowing misrepresentations by a white nationalist leader and coordinated efforts by internet trolls, numerous researchers and media outlets spread a seemingly false claim that the man charged with killing more than a dozen people at a Florida high school belonged to an extremist group,\u201d Shawn Musgrave reported Friday for Politico.\n\n\u201cLaw enforcement agencies say they have no evidence so far to support this claim, and the rumor appears to have been perpetrated by white nationalist trolls themselves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOn Thursday afternoon, the Anti-Defamation League reported that a white supremacist group claimed ties with Nikolas Cruz, who confessed to the shooting spree that killed at least 17 people, including many high-school students, at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.\n\n\u201c \u2018A spokesperson for the white supremacist group Republic of Florida (ROF) told the Anti-Defamation League on Thursday, February 15, that Nikolas Cruz [....] was associated with his group,\u2019 the ADL reported. The ADL quoted a man named Jordan Jereb, who runs the small group, which is based in Tallahassee.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c \u2018Jereb added that ROF had not ordered or wanted Cruz to do anything like the school shooting,\u2019 the ADL wrote in a blog post that was quickly picked up by ABC News and The Associated Press, and later percolated through dozens of other media outlets. Even The Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi website, picked up the claim\n\n\u201cSome outlets reported they had their own conversations with Jereb or classmates of Cruz who allegedly corroborated the association of Cruz with ROF.\n\n\u201cBut a few hours later, after law enforcement agencies said they had no evidence linking Cruz to ROF, Jereb said his identification of Cruz was a \u2018misunderstanding\u2019 and that he, too, had been the subject of a \u2018prank.\u2019 On online forums and Twitter, trolls and white nationalists gloated at the disinformation they had sowed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c \u2018All of our evidence seems to point to the ADL getting this wrong,\u2019 said Joan Donovan, a researcher who tracks online misinformation campaigns for Data & Society, a think tank in New York City.\n\n\u201cThe ADL subsequently revised its report, as did many news outlets. . . .\u201d\n\nAssociated Press: White nationalist leader walks back comments that shooting suspect was group member\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJarvis DeBerry, NOLA.com | Times-Picayune: The numbing effect of multiple school shootings\n\nEditorial, Daily News, New York: Trump shoots blanks: He offers condolences but empty platitudes in the wake of South Florida\u2019s school massacre\n\nEditorial, Miami Herald: Yes, \u2018it\u2019 happened here.

Black Panther, who finds himself in a battle against an army led by the man who killed his father. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDaniels quoted Holland, \u201c \u2018One of the things that I have learned throughout this process is that the world has such rich stories that haven\u2019t been told yet,\u2019 he said. \u2018One of the things that writing these books does for me is it reminds me when I go to work every day that what we do as journalists is that we tell stories.

Woodson came up with the idea of Negro History Week in 1926. He chose the week that included the birthdays of Abraham Lincoln, Feb. 12, and Frederick Douglass, Feb. 14.\n\n\u201cInitially, only North Carolina, Delaware, West Virginia, Baltimore, Md., and Washington, D.C., signed on to the idea \u2014 and only for their black schools, which is exactly what Woodson wanted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSegregation, by law or tradition, was prevalent in the 1920s. Woodson never envisioned white students learning black history. His concern was that black students, deprived of a thorough education about their ancestors, would grow up accepting the yoke of inferiority that white people insisted they wear. . . .\u201d\n\nJackson also wrote, \u201cNegro History Week was ours alone, but Black History Month became something else. Inspired by the black power movement, black students at Kent State University organized the first Black History Month in 1970. The idea caught on and in 1976 President Gerald Ford included Black History Month as part of the nation\u2019s bicentennial celebration.\n\n\u201cWith segregation gone, more schools reserved time each February to study the contributions of prominent African Americans in history \u2014 from Denmark Vesey to Thurgood Marshall to Barack Obama. But unfortunately, learning names, dates, and events was typically as far as their studies went. Too often the necessary attention to context and relevancy was missing from the lessons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat lack of historical context was evident in the results of a study released in January by the Southern Poverty Law Center, which showed only 8 percent of high school seniors knew slavery was the main cause of the Civil War. Two-thirds didn\u2019t know it took a constitutional amendment to end slavery. That\u2019s a sorry testament to how history is being taught in America\u2019s schools.\n\n\u201cInstead of going beyond Woodson\u2019s original idea to focus on the positive contributions of individual African Americans, too many schools use Black History Month as a vehicle to teach a catalog of events and people without making tangible connections to the status of black Americans today.\n\n\u201cOne result is white Americans who don\u2019t believe slavery has anything to do with today\u2019s United States. Neither their regular history classes nor any additional study they may have done during Black History Month helped them connect the dots among slavery, segregation, and the poverty found in too many black communities today. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavid W.

I love them so much that I have two pairs: the wine-and-navy-blue \u201cNew Heights\u201d colorway and the black \u201cMetallic Gold\u201d colorway. They go with everything, and the fit is comfortable enough (and they\u2019re light enough) that I don\u2019t actually feel like I\u2019m wearing basketball shoes.\n\nAnd I\u2019m not much of a basketball-shoe fan in general. I own two pairs of Jordans\u2014they\u2019re both Jordan 1s\u2014and the rest of my shoes are running shoes, casual shoes or boots. Even buying these LeBrons took a while, since, again, I\u2019m not big on basketball shoes and I\u2019ve always found his to look rather bulky on display in stores.\n\nBut one day I was in Foot Locker\u2019s House of Hoops section, and I saw the New Heights XVs sitting on display. I thought they looked interesting, but they also looked pretty unflattering. That day I kept it moving, but the shoes stayed in the back of my mind.\n\nThat\u2019s how I end up buying most of the shoes I like: They stay on my mind. I rarely buy shoes the first time I see them. But if I can\u2019t shake the idea that I want them, I\u2019ll typically go back. I returned to Foot Locker to check them out on every trip to the mall but was still unconvinced that they were shoes I needed to own.\n\nI follow LeBron on Instagram, and there are tons of pictures of his shoes on his feed. The vast majority of them didn\u2019t get me. But there was one picture I saw where he was standing against a car dressed in street clothes, wearing something similar enough to what I\u2019d wear, and he had on his shoes; they looked awesome.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt that point, I decided that I was going to go try them on. Even though I found them unremarkable on display, seeing them on his feet (even through the \u2019gram) rocketed my passing interest to coveting.\n\nSo I went to the store, tried them on and realized, \u201cOh, sweet Jesus\u2014these joints are beauuuutiful on my feet.\u201d Perhaps it\u2019s hyperbolic, but I loved how they looked. I plopped down my money with a smile on my face, feeling ecstatic to separate myself from my hard-earned $196.10 (including tax).\n\nAfter wearing them out, a funny thing started to happen: Several dudes told me that seeing them on somebody convinced them that the shoes were actually pretty fly. It seems that I wasn\u2019t the only one struggling with whether the XVs were dope or not. Some folks were going to buy them because they\u2019re LeBrons. Others are sneakerheads, and while I\u2019m a fringe sneakerhead, I have no idea if the XVs were a hype-beast shoe of choice. But many of us were looking at them in stores and just unconvinced of their potential. But seeing them on my feet changed the game for some people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s happened at least five times. The latest was at a baby shower I attended this past weekend. I threw on the black XVs, and while I was walking around snapping pictures of the event, a friend of mine stopped me and said, \u201cYou\u2019ve convinced me.\u201d I asked him what he was talking about, and he pointed at my feet and said he\u2019d been on the fence, but seeing them on my feet persuaded him that he should cop them.\n\nIt happened at a nightclub once as well. I was walking around minding my business when two dudes walked up to me and said something very similar\u2014that on display, the XVs just don\u2019t look that dope, so they hadn\u2019t even thought to try them on until they peeped them on my feet. Happened at brunch once and randomly at a restaurant bar while I was eating lunch\u2014on the street once, too. It seems that LeBron\u2019s XVs are the ultimate in deceptively fly.\n\nIf you\u2019re into shoes at all, you\u2019re going to pay attention to them. You may hate them, but you will notice them, and I even imagine it\u2019s hard to hate them because they\u2019re so distinctive. The shoes are made of \u201cBattleKnit,\u201d a Flyknit-weave take on the Flyknit material that so many running shoes are currently made of, with the very popular \u201csock\u201d styling that\u2019s all over the sneaker market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey have a look to them, but in stores they look oddly shaped at best. And even on LeBron\u2019s feet in the games\u2014there are tons of pictures featuring his shoes\u2014they didn\u2019t sway me one way or another. And while GQ called the shoes as cool as LeBron is, I was still skeptical.\n\nNope\u2014it took seeing them on LeBron\u2019s feet in a picture of him doing regular shit (and other people complimenting them in everyday wear) for me to realize how awesome they are from a fashion standpoint, and now they\u2019re my go-to shoe for everything from church to picking up hog maws.\n\nI\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t \u201cpass\u201d on these shoes. Get it? Pass. Because LeBron likes to ... pass the ball?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019ll see myself out.", "keywords": ["right", "theyre", "shoes", "seeing", "im", "favorite", "apparently", "look", "nike", "feet", "lebron", "xvs", "lebrons", "looked", "skeptical"], "polarity": 0.14941289224871313, "subjectivity": 0.5803408863110355},

This feels like Vladimir Putin\u2019s handiwork, and should this actually go down, I want cases on all you (Denzel Washington Training Day voice).\n\nAccording to ESPN, James is expected to turn down his $35.6 million player option and become an unrestricted free agent. If the Warriors could clear salary-cap space to make a max contract offer to James, then he\u2019d be willing to take a meeting with the Warriors. While many don\u2019t believe that James will actually accept an offer to create an All-Star team in Cali, below are a few reasons I think he just might do it:\n\nJames Loves Winning Above All Else\n\nI once argued that the fact that James came back to Cleveland was the worst thing that could have happened to Cleveland. Yes, James was instrumental in bringing a championship to Cleveland, but he was also instrumental in destroying the team. He pushed for Cleveland to send overall No. 1 pick Andrew Wiggins and former lottery pick Anthony Bennett to Minnesota for a vegan version of the rebound machine that was Kevin Love. King James ran Kyrie Irving out of town, and now he wants out. Would the Cavs with Kyrie and Wiggins have won a championship? Hell no! But they wouldn\u2019t be as far down on the rebuilding stage once Bron-Bron boned out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJames is going to take his talents where he knows he can guarantee winning, and what better place than Golden State? Adding James to that already stacked lineup is so good it\u2019s unfair, and James has no problem building All-Star teams. He did so in Miami, bringing a then-dominant Chris Bosh, Ray Allen and a younger Dwyane Wade together. It isn\u2019t like this move is beneath him.\n\nIf James Isn\u2019t Strongly Considering the Warriors, Then Why Talk About What They\u2019d Need to Do to Attract Him?\n\nA \u201cno\u201d looks like \u201cno.\u201d It doesn\u2019t look like \u201cclear salary space and then we can talk.\u201d It also doesn\u2019t look like telling the team with the highest payroll in the league exactly what it needs to do to court you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJames and his business team are smart, and I don\u2019t think that these breadcrumbs would be leaked to the media if they didn\u2019t want Golden State to follow up. Not to mention, it\u2019s one way for James to ensure that the team is serious; if in the offseason we hear that Golden State is dumping salaries to make salary-cap space available, it\u2019s safe to assume it is making a push for the King.\n\nJames Is Playing for Legacy\n\nAt 33 years old, James knows that he\u2019s got maybe seven good years left before he needs to start strongly considering retirement. I say he\u2019s got seven years because James is not a normal human and, as such, could play at a highly productive level at 40.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJames wants to leave his mark as the greatest player ever to have played the game, and to do that, he has to surpass at least the Michael Jordan-led Chicago Bulls, who are sitting pretty in \u201cthe greatest\u201d column with five championship rings. James knows there is no way in hell he\u2019ll ever catch Bill Russell and \u2019em, but he at least has to surpass Jordan\u2019s championships in order to be in the argument for best player of all time.\n\nAnd, I hate to say it, but joining the Golden State Warriors would allow him to do just that, at least on paper.\n\nI know it\u2019s still early 2018 and the summer is a ways away, but throwing your hat into the ring to grab arguably the best player in the game can never start too soon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI hear the sports analysts who claim that James would take the meeting only out of respect, but stranger things have happened, and if Bron-Bron is really chasing rings, tell me which team could stop the Golden State Warriors should they form Voltron?", "keywords": ["russia", "knows", "team", "golden", "forget", "player", "meeting", "state", "james", "look", "warriors", "lebron", "space", "collusion", "willing", "cleveland"], "polarity": 0.13315445665445666, "subjectivity": 0.46111294261294244},

I love them so much that I have two pairs: the wine-and-navy-blue \u201cNew Heights\u201d colorway and the black \u201cMetallic Gold\u201d colorway. They go with everything, and the fit is comfortable enough (and they\u2019re light enough) that I don\u2019t actually feel like I\u2019m wearing basketball shoes.\n\nAnd I\u2019m not much of a basketball-shoe fan in general. I own two pairs of Jordans\u2014they\u2019re both Jordan 1s\u2014and the rest of my shoes are running shoes, casual shoes or boots. Even buying these LeBrons took a while, since, again, I\u2019m not big on basketball shoes and I\u2019ve always found his to look rather bulky on display in stores.\n\nBut one day I was in Foot Locker\u2019s House of Hoops section, and I saw the New Heights XVs sitting on display. I thought they looked interesting, but they also looked pretty unflattering. That day I kept it moving, but the shoes stayed in the back of my mind.\n\nThat\u2019s how I end up buying most of the shoes I like: They stay on my mind. I rarely buy shoes the first time I see them. But if I can\u2019t shake the idea that I want them, I\u2019ll typically go back. I returned to Foot Locker to check them out on every trip to the mall but was still unconvinced that they were shoes I needed to own.\n\nI follow LeBron on Instagram, and there are tons of pictures of his shoes on his feed. The vast majority of them didn\u2019t get me. But there was one picture I saw where he was standing against a car dressed in street clothes, wearing something similar enough to what I\u2019d wear, and he had on his shoes; they looked awesome.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt that point, I decided that I was going to go try them on. Even though I found them unremarkable on display, seeing them on his feet (even through the \u2019gram) rocketed my passing interest to coveting.\n\nSo I went to the store, tried them on and realized, \u201cOh, sweet Jesus\u2014these joints are beauuuutiful on my feet.\u201d Perhaps it\u2019s hyperbolic, but I loved how they looked. I plopped down my money with a smile on my face, feeling ecstatic to separate myself from my hard-earned $196.10 (including tax).\n\nAfter wearing them out, a funny thing started to happen: Several dudes told me that seeing them on somebody convinced them that the shoes were actually pretty fly. It seems that I wasn\u2019t the only one struggling with whether the XVs were dope or not. Some folks were going to buy them because they\u2019re LeBrons. Others are sneakerheads, and while I\u2019m a fringe sneakerhead, I have no idea if the XVs were a hype-beast shoe of choice. But many of us were looking at them in stores and just unconvinced of their potential. But seeing them on my feet changed the game for some people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s happened at least five times. The latest was at a baby shower I attended this past weekend. I threw on the black XVs, and while I was walking around snapping pictures of the event, a friend of mine stopped me and said, \u201cYou\u2019ve convinced me.\u201d I asked him what he was talking about, and he pointed at my feet and said he\u2019d been on the fence, but seeing them on my feet persuaded him that he should cop them.\n\nIt happened at a nightclub once as well. I was walking around minding my business when two dudes walked up to me and said something very similar\u2014that on display, the XVs just don\u2019t look that dope, so they hadn\u2019t even thought to try them on until they peeped them on my feet. Happened at brunch once and randomly at a restaurant bar while I was eating lunch\u2014on the street once, too. It seems that LeBron\u2019s XVs are the ultimate in deceptively fly.\n\nIf you\u2019re into shoes at all, you\u2019re going to pay attention to them. You may hate them, but you will notice them, and I even imagine it\u2019s hard to hate them because they\u2019re so distinctive. The shoes are made of \u201cBattleKnit,\u201d a Flyknit-weave take on the Flyknit material that so many running shoes are currently made of, with the very popular \u201csock\u201d styling that\u2019s all over the sneaker market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey have a look to them, but in stores they look oddly shaped at best. And even on LeBron\u2019s feet in the games\u2014there are tons of pictures featuring his shoes\u2014they didn\u2019t sway me one way or another. And while GQ called the shoes as cool as LeBron is, I was still skeptical.\n\nNope\u2014it took seeing them on LeBron\u2019s feet in a picture of him doing regular shit (and other people complimenting them in everyday wear) for me to realize how awesome they are from a fashion standpoint, and now they\u2019re my go-to shoe for everything from church to picking up hog maws.\n\nI\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t \u201cpass\u201d on these shoes. Get it? Pass. Because LeBron likes to ... pass the ball?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019ll see myself out.", "keywords": ["right", "theyre", "shoes", "seeing", "im", "favorite", "apparently", "look", "nike", "feet", "lebron", "xvs", "lebrons", "looked", "skeptical"], "polarity": 0.14941289224871313, "subjectivity": 0.5803408863110355},

To wit, each of the biggest NFL-related stories of the year has been extremely unflattering to the league.\n\nThere\u2019s all of the Colin Kaepernick-related stories (the protests, the reactions from the fans and the front offices and the freakin president to the protests, the boycotts, and the possible collusion to blackball him). And, then, the action on the field has been overshadowed by the conversations about what the action on the field is doing to the brains and bodies of the players.\n\nThe NFL\u2019s ratings have reflected this, falling 9.7 percent this year after falling 8 percent last year\u2014a dip that was then attributed to the election. This decline has led to a $300 million drop in ad revenue. Which, for a multibillion-dollar behemoth, isn\u2019t the end of the world. I doubt anyone in the league\u2019s front office is panicking. But I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the whiskeys they order at their pre-Super Bowl meetings and parties this weekend were doubles.\n\nNaturally, there are myriad possible reasons for this decline in viewership. Most notable is the fact that there are just too many things to watch and too many ways to consume media. People are just doing other things.\n\nIt is interesting, though, that a week before the Super Bowl\u2014the biggest sports and television event of the year\u2014the stories dominating the national sports conversation have nothing to do with the NFL. Instead, we\u2019re discussing, debating and arguing about a draft. A draft for the NBA All-Star Game. A draft that wasn\u2019t even televised. A motherfucking conference call. A Skype conversation between LeBron James and Steph Curry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be fair, I\u2019m sure by this time next week (as the actual game nears), the NFL will be back at the center of our public and cultural consciousness. Especially as the country puts our collective psychic powers together to band against Tom Brady and his merry crew of\u201cMAGA\u201d Patriots.\n\nAnd like every other year, there will be Super Bowl parties, where many people will be only tangentially interested in the actual game.

Brochu, who was expelled from the University of Hartford in Connecticut following the incident, was granted a special type of probation on Monday that would allow her to avoid a criminal record altogether ... as if systematically contaminating another person\u2019s living space were no big deal.\n\nAccording to the Hartford Courant, the victim in this scenario, Brochu\u2019s former roommate Chennell \u201cJazzy\u201d Rowe\u2014who attended the hearing\u2014did not oppose the request for accelerated rehabilitation.

One, because people are usually wrong about that stuff, and I enjoy not being wrong. It's fun. But also, remembering the past in an historical sense is necessary. The \"back and the day when things were better\" game, however, isn't just (usually) wrong. It's fucking boring. I agree with Tony Soprano. \"Remember when\" truly is the lowest form of conversation.\n\nAnd, as a self-appointed guardian of the present, if someone says something like \"Drake wouldn't have survived in the 90s\" within earshot, I feel duty bound to reply \"Um, Coolio sold a trillion records and won a damn Grammy in the 90s. Drake would have been fine.\"\n\nSame goes with sports (because if you watched and assessed 90's basketball with 35-year-old eyes instead of 15-year-old eyes, your feelings about those guys would probably be different), kids today, and even crime (because murder rates have actually dropped tremendously since the early 90s).\n\nThat said, there's one place where I will never not be convinced that things are totally, absolutely, 100% worse than they were back in the day. And that place is the display rack at Foot Locker or Champs or Finish Line or wherever the hell else sneakers are sold today. Now, compared to when I was in high school and college, sneakers themselves come in bolder colors. Kids today apparently love two things: Big Sean and color-blocking. But, aside from them maybe being a bit lighter, they haven't changed much structurally. High tops are still high. Low tops are low. And Adidas hoop sneakers will still tear your ACL. But, HOLY F*CKING SHIT!!! WHEN DID THEY GET SO GOTDAMN EXPENSIVE????? I remember when the only shoes consistently above $100 were Jordans, Foamposites, and maybe a random signature shoe like the Penny Hardaways or the Iversons. Now, every single athletic sneaker seems to be $120-plus, with some even getting up to $275. That's two hundred and seventy five actual American dollars.\n\nI became acutely aware of this horrible, terrible, reprehensible trend of sartorial shittiness earlier this week, as I went to Villa to find a replacement for my hoop shoes \u2014 a pair Nike Zoom HyperRevs I kept so long that they literally exploded on my feet. After picking up a couple pair of Kobes, a couple pair of Durants, and a couple pair of Lebrons, I had to sit for few minutes to stop myself from cackling uncontrollably at the audacity of these bastards actually expecting people to pay cheap cruise ship ticket prices for freakin sneakers. I didn't even bother turning my head in the direction of the Jordan Brand section. I've never had an epiphytic shock seizure, and I don't want to start now. I eventually settled on the Kyrie All-Stars, which I copped for the (relatively) low price of $120.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, I'm aware inflation exists. Everything from electric bills to lapdances generally cost more now than they did 20, even 10 years ago. Because Obama. But sneaker inflation seems to be playing by a different set of rules. And I hate their rules. Their rules suck. This is some CFL shit. Let me put it this way: A base model 2015 Honda Accord is $22,000. Now, I'm not sure how much a 1995 Accord cost, but I'm sure the price has increased since then. I'm also certain the Honda people didn't have this conversation in 1995:\n\n\"What should our business plan be for the next 20 years?\"\n\n\"I think the Accord is fine as is. Doesn't need many more features. Maybe just some bold and exciting colors.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Great! Any other ideas?\"\n\n\"Let's gradually triple the price and just hope no one will notice we've changed nothing other than the variety of Crayons our design people use.\"\n\n\"Great!\"\n\nWhat the hell, man? What happened? Why it happen? Can it happen again? Can someone answer any of these questions?

For reasons that remain unclear, Wojnarowski doesn\u2019t miss opportunities to craft stories about LeBron James in ways that are less than flattering.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s hard not to be fascinated by the latest Woj-bomb, which reports that the Cavs recently had a team meeting where Kevin Love was called out for supposedly faking illnesses:\n\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers held a fiery team meeting in the practice facility locker room prior to Monday\u2019s practice, during which several players challenged the legitimacy of Kevin Love\u2019s illness that led him to leave Saturday\u2019s loss to Oklahoma City early and miss Sunday\u2019s practice, league sources told ESPN. Several players were pushing for the Cavaliers\u2019 management and coaching staff to hold Love accountable for leaving the arena before the end of Saturday\u2019s game, and then missing Sunday\u2019s practice, league sources told ESPN. The meeting was loud and intense, only calming down once Love spoke to those gathered in the room and explained himself, league sources said.\n\nThis story comes on the heels of a report that Isaiah Thomas is frustrating his teammates because he has the ball so much and can\u2019t guard anyone (and yes, just in case you were wondering, this is the same Isaiah Thomas who has only played in seven of the team\u2019s 45 games and is getting acclimated with a new team while also returning and recovering from a broken hip). Which comes on the heels of a report that several prominent players apparently held an off-the-record press conference last week with a few select reporters where they shared their gripes with the team.\n\nWojnarowski addresses this discord near the end of his piece on Love and does it in true LeBron-trolling fashion:\n\nWithin factions of the locker room, there has been blame for the Cavaliers\u2019 struggles directed at everyone from Love to Isaiah Thomas, to Lue and the front office, led by Altman, and owner Dan Gilbert, league sources said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBasically, he\u2019s saying that everyone but LeBron has been blamed for the Cavs\u2019 struggles this year, and you don\u2019t need a Rosetta Stone to know what he\u2019s really implying.\n\nEither way, regardless of who or what\u2019s really behind all the issues with the Cavs, this season would seem to be quite vindicating to the world\u2019s most famous flat-earther, who spent much of the summer being painted as some sort of imbecile for asking to get away from Cleveland (to be fair, the Instagram curriculum he follows\u2014and suggests everyone else follow\u2014hasn\u2019t really helped that perception, BUT WE ARE NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW).\n\nAlthough it might have seemed foolish for a 25-year-old to request to leave the world\u2019s best player and a team that would probably still be a finals shoo-in if he were still there, it doesn\u2019t take much to see why he\u2019d tire of being part of a still shoddily run organization that revolved around one player, especially when everyone except for that one player takes the public blame for their adversity.

The small neighborhood is almost considered a quiet suburb of New York City. Quiet\u2014it is not. Suburban\u2014kinda, sorta, but not quite. Sure, there were blocks of tree-lined streets, houses and backyards with grassy knolls, but it also included the 40s projects, the Baisley houses, crack addicts and drug dealers.\n\nMy hood struck a perfect balance of the world I would face as an adult. On one hand, it could be warm and embracing\u2014on the other, it was cold and calculating. Living in South Jamaica shaped you to thrive in both, but most importantly, the latter. Being exposed to less-conservative conditions gives you grit. The kind of grit a black girl needs to survive psychopathic white chicks when she goes off to college. The type of grit University of Hartford student Jazzy Rowe needed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRowe, also from Queens, grew up in the neighboring Springfield Gardens community, less than 3 miles from South Jamaica. She recently graduated from my alma mater.\n\nReportedly, she was secretly poisoned, over a period of time, by Brianna Brochu, a white student, with whom she shared a dorm room. In a string of Instagram posts, this poor excuse for trashiness described the ways in which she methodically sabotaged Rowe\u2019s personal items with her bodily fluid.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnbeknownst to Rowe, Brochu shared that she had licked Rowe\u2019s eating utensils and plates, spit in her coconut oil, smeared her knapsack with bloody tampons\u2014and tainted her toothbrush with shit. In addition, Brochu admitted to contaminating Rowe\u2019s face lotion with \u201cmoldy clam dip\u201d and tampering with \u201cso much more.\u201d\n\nRowe became mysteriously ill. She suffered from a bacterial infection that wreaked havoc in her throat, for nearly a month, and required antibiotics. She shared the details of the incident in a Facebook Live video. In a police report, she confirmed that her shared living situation was devoid of social interaction. She stated that her roommate barely acknowledged her presence, had a mean vibe, disrespected her and shut off lights while she studied.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRowe requested a room change, and on the day she moved out, a fellow dorm resident and two assistants confronted her with Brochu\u2019s social media posts, detailing the vile behavior toward Rowe. Brochu\u2019s alleged actions were reported to the university and then West Hartford, Conn., police. There were no reports of anyone becoming \u201cextremely pissed.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe reasonable ending stresses the difference between growing up in South Jamaica in my day and being reared in Springfield Gardens today. There is no way I could have remained civil in that matter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI take pleasure in learning that this thug was arrested and later expelled, and had a few misdemeanor charges upgraded to a felonious crime\u2014but not more than I would have taken pleasure if someone\u2014anyone\u2014had handed her ass to her. By that, I mean call on the ancestors, lace up those sneakers, take off them earrings, tie down that hair, grease up that face, crack your knuckles, do some jumping jacks, throw them \u2019bows and tear the club up.\n\nThat did not occur because\u2014and I salute Rowe\u2014of Rowe\u2019s reservation. She was raised right. She is the embodiment of black-girl grace. She is a much better woman than I.\n\n\n\nBrianna Brochu is not.\n\nIn her last public post, she referred to Rowe as \u201cJamaican Barbie.\u201d This tells us all we need to know about how subordinate insipid whiteness feels in close proximity to magical melanin. I\u2019m willing to gamble that Brochu has a Barbie complex that Rowe\u2019s physicality aggravated by far exceeding a perceived beauty standard Brochu cannot identify within herself. It made her sick\u2014and in return, she made Rowe sick, literally.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrochu\u2019s inability to appreciate black excellence juxtaposed with her own mediocrity is attached to the sick and twisted irony of hating black girls while having a deep desire to be one. Brochu goes by @braids_by_breezy for a standalone Instagram account that has since been made private. Instagram users were dragging her. On that account, she showcased her hair-braiding capabilities (perhaps she can use those skills in jail). There were photos of plaits and cornrows with extensions. One image boasted: \u201cstarting the dreads.\u201d It is dreadful.\n\nYet, according to Heavy, Brochu ridiculed Rowe\u2019s bundles in a separate photo used on social media: \u201cThis b[i]tch legit bought a box of f[u]cking hair,\u201d the caption read.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack women\u2019s ability to lay it down, flip it and reverse it with their hair, style and attitude is high art. I can see how the inability to possess such moxie would prompt white woman tears. For Brochu, it triggered white rage.

The small neighborhood is almost considered a quiet suburb of New York City. Quiet\u2014it is not. Suburban\u2014kinda, sorta, but not quite. Sure, there were blocks of tree-lined streets, houses and backyards with grassy knolls, but it also included the 40s projects, the Baisley houses, crack addicts and drug dealers.\n\nMy hood struck a perfect balance of the world I would face as an adult. On one hand, it could be warm and embracing\u2014on the other, it was cold and calculating. Living in South Jamaica shaped you to thrive in both, but most importantly, the latter. Being exposed to less-conservative conditions gives you grit. The kind of grit a black girl needs to survive psychopathic white chicks when she goes off to college. The type of grit University of Hartford student Jazzy Rowe needed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRowe, also from Queens, grew up in the neighboring Springfield Gardens community, less than 3 miles from South Jamaica. She recently graduated from my alma mater.\n\nReportedly, she was secretly poisoned, over a period of time, by Brianna Brochu, a white student, with whom she shared a dorm room. In a string of Instagram posts, this poor excuse for trashiness described the ways in which she methodically sabotaged Rowe\u2019s personal items with her bodily fluid.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnbeknownst to Rowe, Brochu shared that she had licked Rowe\u2019s eating utensils and plates, spit in her coconut oil, smeared her knapsack with bloody tampons\u2014and tainted her toothbrush with shit. In addition, Brochu admitted to contaminating Rowe\u2019s face lotion with \u201cmoldy clam dip\u201d and tampering with \u201cso much more.\u201d\n\nRowe became mysteriously ill. She suffered from a bacterial infection that wreaked havoc in her throat, for nearly a month, and required antibiotics. She shared the details of the incident in a Facebook Live video. In a police report, she confirmed that her shared living situation was devoid of social interaction. She stated that her roommate barely acknowledged her presence, had a mean vibe, disrespected her and shut off lights while she studied.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRowe requested a room change, and on the day she moved out, a fellow dorm resident and two assistants confronted her with Brochu\u2019s social media posts, detailing the vile behavior toward Rowe. Brochu\u2019s alleged actions were reported to the university and then West Hartford, Conn., police. There were no reports of anyone becoming \u201cextremely pissed.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe reasonable ending stresses the difference between growing up in South Jamaica in my day and being reared in Springfield Gardens today. There is no way I could have remained civil in that matter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI take pleasure in learning that this thug was arrested and later expelled, and had a few misdemeanor charges upgraded to a felonious crime\u2014but not more than I would have taken pleasure if someone\u2014anyone\u2014had handed her ass to her. By that, I mean call on the ancestors, lace up those sneakers, take off them earrings, tie down that hair, grease up that face, crack your knuckles, do some jumping jacks, throw them \u2019bows and tear the club up.\n\nThat did not occur because\u2014and I salute Rowe\u2014of Rowe\u2019s reservation. She was raised right. She is the embodiment of black-girl grace. She is a much better woman than I.\n\n\n\nBrianna Brochu is not.\n\nIn her last public post, she referred to Rowe as \u201cJamaican Barbie.\u201d This tells us all we need to know about how subordinate insipid whiteness feels in close proximity to magical melanin. I\u2019m willing to gamble that Brochu has a Barbie complex that Rowe\u2019s physicality aggravated by far exceeding a perceived beauty standard Brochu cannot identify within herself. It made her sick\u2014and in return, she made Rowe sick, literally.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrochu\u2019s inability to appreciate black excellence juxtaposed with her own mediocrity is attached to the sick and twisted irony of hating black girls while having a deep desire to be one. Brochu goes by @braids_by_breezy for a standalone Instagram account that has since been made private. Instagram users were dragging her. On that account, she showcased her hair-braiding capabilities (perhaps she can use those skills in jail). There were photos of plaits and cornrows with extensions. One image boasted: \u201cstarting the dreads.\u201d It is dreadful.\n\nYet, according to Heavy, Brochu ridiculed Rowe\u2019s bundles in a separate photo used on social media: \u201cThis b[i]tch legit bought a box of f[u]cking hair,\u201d the caption read.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack women\u2019s ability to lay it down, flip it and reverse it with their hair, style and attitude is high art. I can see how the inability to possess such moxie would prompt white woman tears. For Brochu, it triggered white rage. Thus, we should not be quick to dismiss Brochu\u2019s behavior as a case of jealousy. Her motivation and subtleties are nothing less than those of her white male contemporaries.\n\nShe is dangerous.\n\nAnd not in the mean-white-girl-who doesn\u2019t-like-the-black-girl kinda way but, rather, an Americanist-white-supremacist-who-hates-smart-beautiful-black-people-who-make-white-trash-feel-uncomfortably-dumb-ugly-and-irrelevant kinda way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe is dangerous in a \u201cDylann Roof shoots and kills nine people in a Charleston, S.C., church\u201d kinda way.\n\nShe is noxious in a \u201cJames Harris Jackson stabs to death Timothy Caughman for being black\u201d kinda way.\n\nShe is malevolent in a \u201cwhite supremacists murder James Byrd Jr., in a lynch-by-dragging romp\u201d kinda way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe is malignant in an \u201cNYC cop Justin Volpe sodomizes Haitian immigrant Abner Louima with a plunger\u201d kinda way.\n\nShe is depraved in a \u201cMichael Griffith chased to his death in Howard Beach by Jon Lester and his white crew\u201d kinda way.\n\nShe is evil in a \u201c14-year-old Emmett Till lynched for flirting with a white woman\u201d kinda way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo matter how many kinds of ways I present this, nor the distance between South Jamaica and Springfield Gardens, the same resounding story rings true.\n\nBrianna Brochu is a terrorist.\n\nShe\u2019s lucky to have not encountered a black woman, from South Jamaica, who doesn\u2019t have a problem with laying hands on her.", "keywords": ["kinda", "jamaica", "justiceforjazzy", "rowe", "wayshe", "black", "white", "south", "look", "woman", "jazzy", "brochu", "rowes"], "polarity": -0.03592068097387245, "subjectivity": 0.4467988394584139},

She will not be returning to the institution. There has been an outpouring of concern for the victim of these acts from across the University and the country. In my meeting with her yesterday, I reiterated my personal commitment to ensuring she has all available personal and academic resources the University can provide.\n\nWoodward reiterated that the university took \u201caction immediately\u201d once the allegations were made known, despite the fact that the victim, Chennel \u201cJazzy\u201d Rowe, claimed that the school attempted to sweep the issue under the rug.\n\n\u201cIt is clear there is work to be done at our University to ensure that all students feel safe, respected, and valued. The conversations that began with student groups, faculty, and staff yesterday are going to continue and involve our full community,\u201d Woodward added. \u201cI am dedicated to that mission and will continue to share additional information about opportunities for our path forward in meaningful dialogue and action.\u201d\n\nRight.\n\nIn that case, one might wonder why it took so long for the university to take action, since shit hit the fan a full two weeks ago. But at least the ball of justice seems to be rolling now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking of justice, Brochu is still facing the relatively weak charges of third-degree criminal mischief and second-degree breach of peace, but the New York Times reports that the West Hartford, Conn., Police Department said it would be requesting that Brochu be slapped with a felony charge of intimidation based on bigotry or bias, which sounds a lot more like it.\n\nEarlier:\n\nA white University of Hartford freshman, who is apparently as nasty and as vindictive as they come, has been arrested after weeks of systematically contaminating her black roommate\u2019s living space in an effort to get her to move out, authorities say.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrianna Rae Brochu, 18, was arrested Saturday and is facing charges of third-degree criminal mischief and second-degree breach of peace after police say she boasted about rubbing used tampons on her black roommate\u2019s bag and contaminating her eating utensils, toothbrush and other beauty products, according to the Hartford Courant.\n\nChennel \u201cJazzy\u201d Rowe, who is also a freshman at the Connecticut school, said that she had gotten a bad vibe from Brochu from day one.\n\n\u201cI kind of felt unwanted and she was giving off vibes,\u201d Rowe told Fox 61.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t until Oct. 17, when Rowe finally moved out, that she realized her roommate had been systematically attacking her in the nastiest of ways.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cShe asked me if I was moving out and I simply said \u2018Yup,\u2019 and she made a face and said \u2018OK,\u2019 and then I saw her pick up her phone and automatically start texting,\u201d Rowe said.\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t the case, authorities say; Brochu was actually posting to Instagram, boasting that she had gotten rid of \u201cJamaican Barbie\u201d using the nastiest methods possible.\n\n\u201cFinally did it yo girl got rid of her roommate!! After 1 1/2 month of spitting in her coconut oil, putting moldy clam dip in her lotions, rubbing used tampons [on] her backpack, putting her toothbrush places where the sun doesn\u2019t shine and so much more I can finally say goodbye Jamaican Barbie,\u201d Brochu wrote in the caption of photos posted on Instagram.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRowe does not follow Brochu on Instagram but says she learned of the incident after one of her resident assistants showed her the posts.\n\nRowe immediately went to the university\u2019s public-safety office as well as West Hartford police and filed a police report, but, she said, the school originally told her that she may or may not hear back about the offenses committed against her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Oct. 18, Rowe was asked to sign a \u201cno contact agreement,\u201d meaning that she would have no communication with Brochu. Rowe says that the school threatened to remove her from campus if she was caught talking about what happened to her.\n\nBut she refused to be silenced. Increasingly frustrated with how she was treated, not only by her roommate but apparently by her school as well, Rowe took to Facebook Live, detailing the horrific story in a lengthy video.\n\nIn the video, Rowe detailed what Brochu did to her and also told of how she had been getting sick continually, an alarming fact given that her living quarters were apparently badly contaminated because of her nasty-ass roommate from hell.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhile I\u2019ve been here, I\u2019ve been getting sick. Not knowing why, I\u2019ve been getting sick. It started with throat pain.

Like, I\u2019d try to whisper and I could barely whisper.\u201d\n\nRowe said that she went to the campus medical center and was prescribed antibiotics, but doctors could not figure out what was wrong. Three tests came back negative, and doctors could only say that there was \u201csome type of bad bacteria\u201d in the back of her throat that was causing the pain.\n\nIn a Facebook post, Rowe also voiced her frustration with the university, unconvinced that the situation would have been handled this way if the roles were reversed:\n\nColleges are known to just sweep issues that happen within the campus under the rug, making the issue disappear and not doing anything about it. Now this isn\u2019t right at all and this is where the public gets involved to push for things to be done right. I\u2019m not holding my tongue any longer about my situation because this is just ridiculous to hear nothing back from my school about this situation. As a African American woman I have to fight for myself and others to not become some statistic. ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe also said in the video, according to Heavy:\n\nAnd the fact I\u2019m black and my old roommate was white, if the roles was switched ... I want to know if it would be handled the same way? I damn well know it wouldn\u2019t. \u2026 I feel like me as a black person and her being a white person, if I\u2019m the woman who committed all these crimes, this would\u2019ve been completely different. \u2026 There were so many crimes committed, that she openly posted. \u2026 I would\u2019ve been locked up already, they would have had no hesitation, cuffed me and taken me away. I\u2019m just so aggravated.\n\nOf course, now that Rowe has gone public, the university is singing a different tune, and saying that it will provide support during the investigation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cUpon learning of the incident, Public Safety immediately ensured that the victim was relocated to a safe location, notified local authorities, and provided support for their investigation,\u201d the school said in a statement. \u201cThe accused student was subsequently arrested by the West Hartford Police Department and her case will proceed through the legal process. The university will continue to precisely execute our defined process outlined in the Code of Student Conduct.\u201d\n\nThe school also insisted that it did its due diligence, calling any other information to the contrary \u201cbased on misinformation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe incident has brought about accusations of racism, and I want you to know that I hear and share your anger and frustration. Acts of racism, bias, bullying, or other abusive behaviors will not be tolerated on this campus.

After widespread scrutiny and a big social media push, the University of Hartford is finally showing up and showing out, and Brianna Brochu\u2014who is accused of rubbing used tampons and contaminating her black roommate\u2019s living space\u2014has been expelled and is considered persona non grata on campus.\n\nUniversity President Greg Woodward released a statement Wednesday afternoon, saying in part:\n\nAs of this morning, Brianna Brochu is no longer a student at the University of Hartford. She will not be returning to the institution. There has been an outpouring of concern for the victim of these acts from across the University and the country. In my meeting with her yesterday, I reiterated my personal commitment to ensuring she has all available personal and academic resources the University can provide.\n\nWoodward reiterated that the university took \u201caction immediately\u201d once the allegations were made known, despite the fact that the victim, Chennel \u201cJazzy\u201d Rowe, claimed that the school attempted to sweep the issue under the rug.\n\n\u201cIt is clear there is work to be done at our University to ensure that all students feel safe, respected, and valued. The conversations that began with student groups, faculty, and staff yesterday are going to continue and involve our full community,\u201d Woodward added. \u201cI am dedicated to that mission and will continue to share additional information about opportunities for our path forward in meaningful dialogue and action.\u201d\n\nRight.\n\nIn that case, one might wonder why it took so long for the university to take action, since shit hit the fan a full two weeks ago. But at least the ball of justice seems to be rolling now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking of justice, Brochu is still facing the relatively weak charges of third-degree criminal mischief and second-degree breach of peace, but the New York Times reports that the West Hartford, Conn., Police Department said it would be requesting that Brochu be slapped with a felony charge of intimidation based on bigotry or bias, which sounds a lot more like it.\n\nEarlier:\n\nA white University of Hartford freshman, who is apparently as nasty and as vindictive as they come, has been arrested after weeks of systematically contaminating her black roommate\u2019s living space in an effort to get her to move out, authorities say.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrianna Rae Brochu, 18, was arrested Saturday and is facing charges of third-degree criminal mischief and second-degree breach of peace after police say she boasted about rubbing used tampons on her black roommate\u2019s bag and contaminating her eating utensils, toothbrush and other beauty products, according to the Hartford Courant.\n\nChennel \u201cJazzy\u201d Rowe, who is also a freshman at the Connecticut school, said that she had gotten a bad vibe from Brochu from day one.\n\n\u201cI kind of felt unwanted and she was giving off vibes,\u201d Rowe told Fox 61.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t until Oct. 17, when Rowe finally moved out, that she realized her roommate had been systematically attacking her in the nastiest of ways.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cShe asked me if I was moving out and I simply said \u2018Yup,\u2019 and she made a face and said \u2018OK,\u2019 and then I saw her pick up her phone and automatically start texting,\u201d Rowe said.\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t the case, authorities say; Brochu was actually posting to Instagram, boasting that she had gotten rid of \u201cJamaican Barbie\u201d using the nastiest methods possible.\n\n\u201cFinally did it yo girl got rid of her roommate!! After 1 1/2 month of spitting in her coconut oil, putting moldy clam dip in her lotions, rubbing used tampons [on] her backpack, putting her toothbrush places where the sun doesn\u2019t shine and so much more I can finally say goodbye Jamaican Barbie,\u201d Brochu wrote in the caption of photos posted on Instagram.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRowe does not follow Brochu on Instagram but says she learned of the incident after one of her resident assistants showed her the posts.\n\nRowe immediately went to the university\u2019s public-safety office as well as West Hartford police and filed a police report, but, she said, the school originally told her that she may or may not hear back about the offenses committed against her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Oct. 18, Rowe was asked to sign a \u201cno contact agreement,\u201d meaning that she would have no communication with Brochu. Rowe says that the school threatened to remove her from campus if she was caught talking about what happened to her.\n\nBut she refused to be silenced. Increasingly frustrated with how she was treated, not only by her roommate but apparently by her school as well, Rowe took to Facebook Live, detailing the horrific story in a lengthy video.\n\nIn the video, Rowe detailed what Brochu did to her and also told of how she had been getting sick continually, an alarming fact given that her living quarters were apparently badly contaminated because of her nasty-ass roommate from hell.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhile I\u2019ve been here, I\u2019ve been getting sick. Not knowing why, I\u2019ve been getting sick. It started with throat pain. I thought maybe because it\u2019s colder up here, I\u2019m just probably catching a cold,\u201d Rowe said. \u201cThe sore throat pain got worse and it was just throat pain. And this was happening for about a month. It got to the point where I had extreme throat pain where I couldn\u2019t sleep, to the point where I couldn\u2019t speak. Like, I\u2019d try to whisper and I could barely whisper.\u201d\n\nRowe said that she went to the campus medical center and was prescribed antibiotics, but doctors could not figure out what was wrong. Three tests came back negative, and doctors could only say that there was \u201csome type of bad bacteria\u201d in the back of her throat that was causing the pain.\n\nIn a Facebook post, Rowe also voiced her frustration with the university, unconvinced that the situation would have been handled this way if the roles were reversed:\n\nColleges are known to just sweep issues that happen within the campus under the rug, making the issue disappear and not doing anything about it. Now this isn\u2019t right at all and this is where the public gets involved to push for things to be done right. I\u2019m not holding my tongue any longer about my situation because this is just ridiculous to hear nothing back from my school about this situation. As a African American woman I have to fight for myself and others to not become some statistic. ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe also said in the video, according to Heavy:\n\nAnd the fact I\u2019m black and my old roommate was white, if the roles was switched ... I want to know if it would be handled the same way? I damn well know it wouldn\u2019t. \u2026 I feel like me as a black person and her being a white person, if I\u2019m the woman who committed all these crimes, this would\u2019ve been completely different. \u2026 There were so many crimes committed, that she openly posted. \u2026 I would\u2019ve been locked up already, they would have had no hesitation, cuffed me and taken me away. I\u2019m just so aggravated.\n\nOf course, now that Rowe has gone public, the university is singing a different tune, and saying that it will provide support during the investigation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cUpon learning of the incident, Public Safety immediately ensured that the victim was relocated to a safe location, notified local authorities, and provided support for their investigation,\u201d the school said in a statement. \u201cThe accused student was subsequently arrested by the West Hartford Police Department and her case will proceed through the legal process. The university will continue to precisely execute our defined process outlined in the Code of Student Conduct.\u201d\n\nThe school also insisted that it did its due diligence, calling any other information to the contrary \u201cbased on misinformation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe incident has brought about accusations of racism, and I want you to know that I hear and share your anger and frustration. Acts of racism, bias, bullying, or other abusive behaviors will not be tolerated on this campus. I pledge to do everything in my power to work with our community to address related concerns together,\u201d school President Greg Woodward added in the statement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for Beckzilla Brochu, because white womanhood, she is currently free on $1,000 bail and is due back in court Wednesday, according to Heavy.

And as my dad explained to my mom and me, finally being with kids my own age would give me an advantage athletically and socially (this would prove to be true; although differences in age matter less and less the older you get, for an 11- or 12-year-old, a year is fucking huge).\n\nUnfortunately, there was a catch. St. Barts\u2019 colors were green and gold, which meant I wouldn\u2019t be able to hoop in Jordans anymore because back then, Jordans only came in variations of the Chicago Bulls\u2019 colors\u2014black, white and red. And this was also back when matching your sneakers with your uniform was a priority, and most of my shorts, shirts and sweats reflected this color scheme. I dressed like I was a Bulls ball boy or Horace Grant\u2019s nephew. So I secretly and silently lamented the prospect of retiring my very specific wardrobe for bitch-ass green-and-gold gear.\n\nMy Bulls standom began around the time I first started watching NBA basketball. I\u2019d beg my parents to allow me to stay up when the Tuesday-night Bulls games happened to be on TBS, and I\u2019d devour Street & Smith and Hoop Magazine and Basketball Digest and every other magazine with extensive Bulls- and NBA-related content. And when they finally broke past the Pistons, made it to the NBA Finals and won the championship, I was overjoyed that this team\u2014my team, the team I\u2019d supported since the dark Stan Albeck days\u2014finally reached the pinnacle.\n\nAnd then, three years later, when Michael Jordan was swinging (and missing) at breaking balls and the Scottie Pippen-led Bulls were still finals contenders, I didn\u2019t give a shit about them\u2014not because I\u2019d become apathetic to the NBA but because I just wasn\u2019t as interested in the Jordanless Bulls.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimilar things had happened in previous years, where my rooting interests for the Los Angeles Lakers and the Golden State Warriors (my next-favorite teams) slowly dissipated after Magic Johnson retired and Tim Hardaway was traded to the Miami Heat. But I assumed that my Bulls\u2019 standom was real and would withstand the loss of Jordan. It did not. I was a fan of his first. The Bulls just happened to be a convenient and efficient Michael Jordan delivery system.\n\n\n\nSince then, I\u2019ve secretly embraced my brand of NBA fandom. When Allen Iverson and Vince Carter were the two guys I most enjoyed watching play, Iverson\u2019s Sixers and Carter\u2019s Raptors were the teams I pulled for. When LeBron James entered the league in 2003, the Cavs\u2014the fucking Cavs\u2014were all of a sudden appointment TV and remained that way until he left for Miami. And then, when the Cavs drafted my favorite college basketball player of all time, I became perhaps the only person in America who rooted for the Cavs and the Heat.\n\n(Interestingly enough, you\u2019d think that after LeBron came back to Cleveland, this would have simplified things for me with my two favorite players on the same team. But I actually prefer it now that Kyrie Irving is in Boston and they\u2019re apart again. And I\u2019ve discovered that I\u2019m more of a Kyrie fan than a LeBron fan.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSometimes I feel as if I should feel bad about this\u2014that being a mercenary cheats me out of the sports-fandom experience. That rooting for a team regardless of who happens to be playing for them isn\u2019t just the best way to be a fan\u2014it\u2019s the most honorable and possesses the most integrity because fandom needs an appropriate amount of patience and suffering shoehorned into the experience for it to matter.\n\nAnd to be fair, this is my experience with Pittsburgh-based sports teams. My favorite NFL team is the Steelers, my favorite MLB team the Pirates; I\u2019ll only watch an NHL game if the Penguins are playing (and it\u2019s the playoffs), and I root for the University of Pittsburgh.\n\nBut there\u2019s no NBA presence in Pittsburgh. And while this would seem to be infuriating for a person whose favorite sport is basketball and who watches so much NBA League Pass that Comcast should be paying me, it\u2019s been liberating. I\u2019m not beholden to geography or laundry. I enjoy watching NBA basketball, and my rooting interests lie with the people who happen to give me the most enjoyment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDoes this mean I only root for players? No. I loved the Seven Seconds or Less Suns, Baron Davis\u2019 Warriors, the current iteration of the Sixers and other teams I enjoyed watching despite the fact that none of the players on them would have been considered my favorites. Also, having favorite players instead of favorite teams doesn\u2019t shield you from sports-related anxiety and suffering.\n\nI think I was the only person outside of Cleveland and the Cavs\u2019 own family members who watched them in those Kyrie and Alonzo Gee years, and being a fan of LeBron means that while my \u201cfavorite team\u201d gets to the finals quite frequently, I\u2019ve mourned finals losses more than I\u2019ve celebrated victories. I know traditional team-first fans would consider what I\u2019m doing bandwagon hopping and/or cheating. But that would only apply if I just rooted for the best teams each year.\n\n(Also, for the record, fuck you and your archaic and self-righteous rules of fandom. No one gives a shit how long you \u201csuffered\u201d just because you happened to be born in a city with shitty ownership and your teams are always ass. You\u2019re not a better person than I am. You\u2019re just from Washington, D.C.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaybe things would have been different if St. Barts had red-and-black colors, too. Perhaps I would have been so used to rooting for one color scheme that it would have eventually bled into my fandom tendencies. I\u2019m fortunate that it didn\u2019t, though, because those post-LeBron Cavs are going to be a shit show, and I\u2019m glad I\u2019ll be able to ignore Cleveland again soon.", "keywords": ["bulls", "team", "im", "defense", "following", "nba", "basketball", "rooting", "players", "favorite", "instead", "watching", "teams"], "polarity": 0.12177287581699346, "subjectivity": 0.5307189542483659},

Maxine Waters: Breaker of Chains, Reclaimer of Time\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter having to suffer the devastating dishonor of having an orange buffoon in the White House, black people have pretty much been fed up since before 2017. And no person illustrated this \u201cfed-uppedness\u201d more than longtime career politician Rep. Maxine Waters.\n\n\n\nMadame Waters (D-Calif.) was, quite frankly, the mood of 2017. From her hilarious and biting tweets to her determination to see Donald Trump impeached, she simply had no fucks to give. And the greatest example of this was when her legitimate question about 45\u2019s financial ties to Russia was interrupted by wayward Caucasian American Steven Mnuchin. The deflection did not deter her and she instead repeated \u201cReclaiming my time\u201d over and over again until he eventually shut the fuck up.\n\nShe\u2019s a boss. You know it. I know it. And 2017 knew it.\n\n2. Michelle Obama and the Side Eye Seen\u2019t Around the World\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMuch despair was felt through the force when it was announced that Agent Orange was gonna waltz his baked-Cheeto, dusty ass into the White House. And while that was bad enough, most of us couldn\u2019t stop thinking about how little time we had left to spend with the Obamas. So imagine our surprise when Michelle Obama gifted us with enough side eye during Inauguration Day to help us power through the rest of 2017.\n\nYes, before she would walk into the sunset with her beloved Barack and say goodbye to us forever, our good sis Michelle gave the best side eye ever after getting a gift from Melania and listening to all the Inauguration Day malarkey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was her final act as first lady. And what an act it was.\n\n3. Anika Noni Rose Lovingly Encouraging Cicely Tyson at the Emmys\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have a love-hate relationship with the Emmys, mostly based on how Caucasian the nomination lineups are for the night. However, I luckily caught a few moments from the 2017 Emmys. And I\u2019m glad I did because had I not, I would have missed one of the greatest moments in Black Girl Magic history.\n\n\n\nThe moment includes both Anika Noni Rose and Cicely Tyson going up to announce the winner for Outstanding Limited Series. The immortal Tyson paused right before recalling her role in Roots, and instead of awkwardly standing there until Tyson remembered, Rose leaned over and whispered an encouragement in Tyson\u2019s ears.\n\n\n\nIt was one of the simplest yet greatest acts of black sisterhood and solidarity that I had seen in a while. And in a year that was as brutal as 2017, it was sorely needed.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. World Stop: Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Pregnancy Announcement\n\nGreatness begets greatness. I don\u2019t know who said that, and I don\u2019t care to ask, but just know that it has been and always will be applied to Her Majesty King Beyonc\u00e9, First and Only of Her Name.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter having a fantastic year in 2016, Beyonc\u00e9 blew our black minds when she surprise-announced her pregnancy on Instagram with the radiance and grace of a black Madonna. And while gracing us with her otherworldliness, she managed to piss off white women and white conservatives and inspire low-budget Great Value copycats in one wild swoop.\n\nNever change, Bey. Never change.\n\n5. Black Twitter Gathering Kendall Jenner\u2019s Edges Over That Pepsi Commercial\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlenty of black folx had a fantastic year. Cardi B had a fantastic year. Issa Rae had a phenomenal year. Rihanna had a spectacular year. New Edition had an amazing year. And Tiffany Haddish had an astounding year.\n\n\n\nThe list of black people laughing in the face of 2017 is very long. But such a list would be incomplete without the collective that is Black Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack Twitter has been a respected entity for a while now. But it truly cemented itself as a cultural force for change when it single-handedly got Kendall Jenner\u2019s tone-deaf-ass Pepsi commercial yoinked from the TV airwaves. Indeed, Jenner thought she was doing all of us a favor by throwing some dusty Party City wig at a fellow sista in the commercial (an apt self-dragging of white feminism) before hijacking black and brown traditions of protest, and Black Twitter, of course, said, \u201cNot today, Satan.\u201d\n\n\n\nCombine this with other cultural moments like spurring on (along with Black Tumblr) Netflix to make that Rihanna-Lupita Nyong\u2019o Heist movie, penned by Issa Rae and directed by Ava DuVernay, a reality and exposing the hell out of Keaton Jones\u2019 white supremacist family, and it is very clear that Black Twitter is here to stay and suffers no fools.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. Black Women in Alabama Telling Roy Moore, \u201cYou Thought!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou probably notice how I keep mentioning that 2017 was a tough-ass year. This is most certainly true, especially politically.\n\nSince the Over-Inflated Tangerine was voted into office by white women, it\u2019s been a yearlong battle to make sure that our legislators, quite frankly, do not kill us. This has been true concerning the Affordable Care Act, the GOP tax plan, net neutrality and so much more. So you can say, politically, we really needed a win.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd black women gave us exactly that in the election battle between Roy Moore and Doug Jones for a U.S. Senate seat representing Alabama.\n\nThe choice was between an accused child-molesting, homophobic bigot and a Democrat, Doug Jones, and white people almost purposely screwed the pooch again by voting in the alleged child molester because he was \u201ccloser to God\u201d (cue an eye roll). Of course, black women did not allow this to pass.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was a nod to the 94 percent who showed us they had common sense during the general election, and it proved that, yes, even states like Alabama (where black people live, too, Bernie Sanders) can have competitive elections if given the fucking chance.\n\nBlack women, I salute you. Truly.\n\n7. It Ain\u2019t Over Till It\u2019s Over: Moonlight\n\nIn that same vein, 2017 must have been the year of \u201cHold up, wait a minute,\u201d because not only did black people pull off the upset in Alabama this year, but we managed to pull it off during Oscar season, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarlier this year, La La Land was heavily projected to win the Oscar for Best Picture over Moonlight, and despite all the queer black people everywhere giving Goku our energy for a spirit bomb, it looked like La La Land would indeed win. And that much was confirmed when B(La)h B(La)h Land was crowned winner.\n\nThat is ... until it was un-crowned.\n\nIn one of the most confusing moments of 2017, La La Land producer Jordan Horowitz snatched the card from the dazed and confused presenter and clarified that it was Moonlight that had actually won Best Picture. I\u2019m always gonna wonder who I need to drag for low-key stealing Moonlight\u2019s moment, but this should be a lesson to us as a people that it is not over until we say it\u2019s over.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. Colin Kaepernick Has the Last Laugh\n\nColin Kaepernick\u2019s long, hard-fought battle to call out police brutality and systemic injustice started out in 2016 when he, a San Francisco 49ers quarterback at the time, sat down during the playing of the national anthem at a preseason game versus the Green Bay Packers.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince then, the football player and activist has been the center of an intense, national debate on racial and social injustice, and because he continued to walk and talk the talk, the powers that be decided that Kaepernick would enter the year as an unsigned free agent, despite being more talented than plenty of other current quarterbacks (*stares at Jay Cutler*).\n\n\n\nAnd these racist NFL owners probably had a good chuckle over it all ... until it was announced that Kaepernick was suing the shit out of all of them, of course.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot only did Kaepernick decide to bring a case against them, but he also went on to become GQ\u2019s Citizen of the Year, and he\u2019s currently mulling over the prospect of maybe owning the Carolina Panthers alongside Diddy and Steph Curry.\n\nClearly, Kaepernick is just getting started.\n\n9. Black People Do Do Horror: On Get Out Being a Success\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn times of trial and tribulation, black art has risen like a phoenix and thrived in the face of uncertainty, and Get Out was certainly not an exception this year.\n\n\n\nJordan Peele\u2019s directorial debut and smash hit changed the game forever this year.\n\nNot only did it make bank with a film budget that sounded like the movie-producing equivalent of $3, but its biting social commentary on racial relations in America presented in the horror genre reminded us of how multifaceted black people are and how it\u2019s about damn time that black creatives get to flex our muscles in genre movies (another great example of this is Dee Rees\u2019 Mudbound, which no doubt counts as a Western/period piece).\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd not even the Golden Globes\u2019 outdated genre system can take this win away from us.\n\n10. LeBron James Calling Donald Trump by His Name: \u201cBum\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the year when white people continued to show their asses and black people made a conscious and collective decision to stop giving a singular fuck, no such person illustrated this big mood quite like LeBron R. James.\n\nJames, a three-time NBA champ, has proved time and time again that he doesn\u2019t concern himself with the opinions of sheep, but he took this attitude to the next level when the Expired Squash got in his Twitter feelings about Steph Curry and the Golden State Warriors\u2019 declining his booty-ass invite to visit the White (Supremacist) House.\n\nTrump was about five more seconds from going full Mean Girls on Curry (which included uninviting them) when James became sick of the bullshit and fired off the tweet heard around the world:\n\nHe called 45 a \u201cbum.\u201d\n\nThe legendary tweet is still on James\u2019 Twitter page. To this day. And I am hoping that it continues to serve as a visible reminder that black people from all walks of life are never too busy to speak truth to power and call a spade a spade. All while having a good and necessary laugh.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd that\u2019s that on that.", "keywords": ["la", "women", "moments", "white", "2017", "twitter", "kaepernick", "tyson", "land", "won", "black"], "polarity": 0.10843534659042689, "subjectivity": 0.4960628438703303},

It turns out, however, that Budden has left the show for good after almost nine months.\n\nAs of press time, we don\u2019t know if Budden quit, got fired or some mixture of the two\u2014though his Twitter activity would have us believe that he bailed because Complex got funny with the money. What I do know is that, with his absence, Everyday Struggle will likely fall from my very short list of daily must-watch shows.\n\nThe show thrived on the chemistry of Budden, YouTube personality DJ Akademiks and host Nadeska Alexis. But the \u201cretired\u201d Slaughterhouse rapper was undoubtedly the anchor; I mostly ignored every Friday episode in which he took off and was replaced by a guest host.\n\nTruth is, no one chimed into Everyday Struggle to hear Akademiks heap encomium on these pink-tip-dreaded, face-tatted, drug-addicted mumble-rap niggas. And while Alexis is my second wife in my head, I have zero confidence that the two of them can carry the show with a rotating list of guest hosts (exhibit A: This week\u2019s guest host, Shadyville Entertainment\u2019s DJ Whoo Kid, inelegantly danced around how much of a flaming dumpster-chemical-fire shit show his boss Eminem\u2019s new album is).\n\nThe show\u2019s fans are justifiably unhappy with the news of Budden\u2019s departure; perhaps the best tweet on the issue evoked a clip of Leon\u2019s indelible portrayal of David Ruffin in The Temptations TV movie:\n\nTrillmonger on Twitter \u201cJoe Budden was the David Ruffin of Everyday Struggle. Akademiks cool but https://t.co/h0q90IlcfD\u201d Read more Read\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s true: Akademiks is Otis Williams here, and two bits to a bottle of piss says the show completely falls apart without Budden\u2019s Ruffin. The whole thing got me to thinking about other instances of good things that became trash when someone important departed.\n\n1. LeBron James leaving Cleveland.\n\nI\u2019ll freely admit that I\u2019m not the biggest NBA fan to ever walk the earth. But I was utterly amused at how openly butt-hurt the entire city of Cleveland was when James decided to leave the Cavaliers to win some rings with the Miami Heat, only for them to welcome him back with open arms when he decided to return. Surprising no one, the Cavs didn\u2019t get within spitting distance of a ring without James. It\u2019s like James was Jabba the Hutt and Dan Gilbert was Princess Leia in the slave outfit, having his ass dragged along against his will.\n\n2. Your mom\u2019s favorite \u201970s group.\n\nLionel Richie and Diana Ross are living R&B legends, but they were once members of bands whose other members you couldn\u2019t name if someone offered to pay off your car note to do so. No one cared about the Supremes after Ross left; and \u201cNightshift\u201d is my jam, but it doesn\u2019t ride like \u201cZoom.\u201d Also, the erstwhile Jackson 5 released a 1989 album without Michael that I literally didn\u2019t know existed until four minutes ago; that group was especially doomed because everyone aside from Michael sang like Drake with tinnitus.\n\n3. Martin when the goodwill left.\n\nFor my bread, Martin is probably, pound for pound, the funniest sitcom of all time. But the show totally lost its air during season 5, when Tisha Campbell sued Martin Lawrence for sexual harassment and assault of the verbal and physical variety (come to think of it, is any dude associated with Def Comedy Jam worth a damn when it comes to women?). Campbell agreed to finish the show as long as their characters, Martin and Gina, didn\u2019t share any scenes together. The results were horrible, and the show was put out of its misery after season 5.\n\n4. New York Undercover without Eddie Torres.\n\nNew York Undercover was revolutionary television precisely because it was the first show ever to have black and Puerto Rican men as the leads (not to mention the dopest soundtrack for a television show ever). J.C. Williams and Torres\u2019 partnership was the heart of the show, but when contract squabbles led to Michael DeLorenzo\u2019s Torres being killed off, we were forced to endure a fourth season helmed by Malik Yoba (Williams) and Tommy Ford (RIP) that was the equivalent of what Power would look like if there was a Ghost with no Tommy.\n\n5. Good Times without James.\n\nI grew up watching Good Times in syndication in the 1980s. Even as a child, I recognized that the show was not the same after they killed James off\u2014in part because actor John Amos was frustrated with co-star Jimmie Walker\u2019s shuck-and-jive act (how prescient). Florida Evans as a single mother making a way for her kids mirrored many black families, but the beauty of the original lineup was a full black family making their way in a chow line.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. McDonald\u2019s without the McRib.\n\nBottom line: Grown-ups with means should not be consuming McDonald\u2019s on an even semiregular basis, for a litany of reasons. But the fast-food behemoth likes to play with our emotions and mess with the only thing it has between two buns that\u2019s worth a goddamn for (admittedly genius) marketing reasons. People care so much about what\u2019s really an OK-ass sandwich at the end of the day, there\u2019s a McRib Locator. Because you can get good french fries anywhere, and chicken nuggets do not a whole chain carry.\n\n7. Destiny\u2019s Child without Beyonc\u00e9.\n\nI mean, this isn\u2019t even a thing. And it never could be. Kelly, Michelle, LaTavia, LeToya, Donner, Dasher and Blitzen couldn\u2019t book a Motel 6 in Deer Lodge, Mont., without y\u2019all\u2019s queen at the helm.

After 1 1/2 month of spitting in her coconut oil, putting moldy clam dip in her lotions, rubbing used tampons [on] her backpack, putting her toothbrush places where the sun doesn\u2019t shine and so much more I can finally say goodbye Jamaican Barbie,\u201d Brochu wrote in the caption of photos posted on Instagram.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRowe does not follow Brochu on Instagram but says she learned of the incident after one of her resident assistants showed her the posts.\n\nRowe immediately went to the university\u2019s public-safety office as well as West Hartford police and filed a police report, but, she said, the school originally told her that she may or may not hear back about the offenses committed against her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Oct. 18, Rowe was asked to sign a \u201cno contact agreement,\u201d meaning that she would have no communication with Brochu. Rowe says that the school threatened to remove her from campus if she was caught talking about what happened to her.\n\nBut she refused to be silenced. Increasingly frustrated with how she was treated, not only by her roommate but apparently by her school as well, Rowe took to Facebook Live, detailing the horrific story in a lengthy video.\n\nIn the video, Rowe detailed what Brochu did to her and also told of how she had been getting sick continually, an alarming fact given that her living quarters were apparently badly contaminated because of her nasty-ass roommate from hell.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhile I\u2019ve been here, I\u2019ve been getting sick. Not knowing why, I\u2019ve been getting sick. It started with throat pain. I thought maybe because it\u2019s colder up here, I\u2019m just probably catching a cold,\u201d Rowe said. \u201cThe sore throat pain got worse and it was just throat pain. And this was happening for about a month. It got to the point where I had extreme throat pain where I couldn\u2019t sleep, to the point where I couldn\u2019t speak. Like, I\u2019d try to whisper and I could barely whisper.\u201d\n\nRowe said that she went to the campus medical center and was prescribed antibiotics, but doctors could not figure out what was wrong. Three tests came back negative, and doctors could only say that there was \u201csome type of bad bacteria\u201d in the back of her throat that was causing the pain.\n\nIn a Facebook post, Rowe also voiced her frustration with the university, unconvinced that the situation would have been handled this way if the roles were reversed:\n\nColleges are known to just sweep issues that happen within the campus under the rug, making the issue disappear and not doing anything about it. Now this isn\u2019t right at all and this is where the public gets involved to push for things to be done right. I\u2019m not holding my tongue any longer about my situation because this is just ridiculous to hear nothing back from my school about this situation. As a African American woman I have to fight for myself and others to not become some statistic. ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe also said in the video, according to Heavy:\n\nAnd the fact I\u2019m black and my old roommate was white, if the roles was switched ... I want to know if it would be handled the same way? I damn well know it wouldn\u2019t. \u2026 I feel like me as a black person and her being a white person, if I\u2019m the woman who committed all these crimes, this would\u2019ve been completely different. \u2026 There were so many crimes committed, that she openly posted. \u2026 I would\u2019ve been locked up already, they would have had no hesitation, cuffed me and taken me away. I\u2019m just so aggravated.\n\nOf course, now that Rowe has gone public, the university is singing a different tune, and saying that it will provide support during the investigation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cUpon learning of the incident, Public Safety immediately ensured that the victim was relocated to a safe location, notified local authorities, and provided support for their investigation,\u201d the school said in a statement. \u201cThe accused student was subsequently arrested by the West Hartford Police Department and her case will proceed through the legal process. The university will continue to precisely execute our defined process outlined in the Code of Student Conduct.\u201d\n\nThe school also insisted that it did its due diligence, calling any other information to the contrary \u201cbased on misinformation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe incident has brought about accusations of racism, and I want you to know that I hear and share your anger and frustration. Acts of racism, bias, bullying, or other abusive behaviors will not be tolerated on this campus. I pledge to do everything in my power to work with our community to address related concerns together,\u201d school President Greg Woodward added in the statement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for Beckzilla Brochu, because white womanhood, she is currently free on $1,000 bail and is due back in court Wednesday, according to Heavy. Both of her charges are Class B misdemeanors, meaning that they would carry a maximum sentence of six months in prison and possibly a fine.\n\nThe Courant notes that Brochu attempted to play the victim, saying that she \u201cbegan to lash out due to a \u2018hostile environment\u2019 caused by [the victim\u2019s] rude behavior, not compromising and posting Snapchat videos of me sleeping and making fun of me snoring.\u201d\n\nSo, because of someone allegedly being rude and posting Snapchat videos of you sleeping, your next level of action and the response that you deem appropriate is rubbing your period blood all over the person\u2019s bag and licking her plate, fork and spoon?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy the way, Brochu did confess to licking Rowe\u2019s eating utensils and smearing blood on her backpack, but she denied any other actions she posted about on Instagram, claiming that it \u201cwas a lie in an attempt to \u2018appear funny.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Beckery.\n\nMeanwhile, social media is rallying behind Rowe, starting the hashtag #JusticeForJazzy and demanding that the University of Hartford stop talking about it and instead just be about it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement", "keywords": ["rowe", "im", "expelled", "used", "white", "rubbing", "school", "university", "space", "roommates", "throat", "living", "tampons", "freshman", "black", "brochu", "roommate", "hartford"], "polarity": -0.03695306071339131, "subjectivity": 0.4264346535007693},

The small neighborhood is almost considered a quiet suburb of New York City. Quiet\u2014it is not. Suburban\u2014kinda, sorta, but not quite. Sure, there were blocks of tree-lined streets, houses and backyards with grassy knolls, but it also included the 40s projects, the Baisley houses, crack addicts and drug dealers.\n\nMy hood struck a perfect balance of the world I would face as an adult. On one hand, it could be warm and embracing\u2014on the other, it was cold and calculating. Living in South Jamaica shaped you to thrive in both, but most importantly, the latter. Being exposed to less-conservative conditions gives you grit. The kind of grit a black girl needs to survive psychopathic white chicks when she goes off to college. The type of grit University of Hartford student Jazzy Rowe needed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRowe, also from Queens, grew up in the neighboring Springfield Gardens community, less than 3 miles from South Jamaica. She recently graduated from my alma mater.\n\nReportedly, she was secretly poisoned, over a period of time, by Brianna Brochu, a white student, with whom she shared a dorm room. In a string of Instagram posts, this poor excuse for trashiness described the ways in which she methodically sabotaged Rowe\u2019s personal items with her bodily fluid.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnbeknownst to Rowe, Brochu shared that she had licked Rowe\u2019s eating utensils and plates, spit in her coconut oil, smeared her knapsack with bloody tampons\u2014and tainted her toothbrush with shit. In addition, Brochu admitted to contaminating Rowe\u2019s face lotion with \u201cmoldy clam dip\u201d and tampering with \u201cso much more.\u201d\n\nRowe became mysteriously ill. She suffered from a bacterial infection that wreaked havoc in her throat, for nearly a month, and required antibiotics. She shared the details of the incident in a Facebook Live video. In a police report, she confirmed that her shared living situation was devoid of social interaction. She stated that her roommate barely acknowledged her presence, had a mean vibe, disrespected her and shut off lights while she studied.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRowe requested a room change, and on the day she moved out, a fellow dorm resident and two assistants confronted her with Brochu\u2019s social media posts, detailing the vile behavior toward Rowe. Brochu\u2019s alleged actions were reported to the university and then West Hartford, Conn., police. There were no reports of anyone becoming \u201cextremely pissed.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe reasonable ending stresses the difference between growing up in South Jamaica in my day and being reared in Springfield Gardens today. There is no way I could have remained civil in that matter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI take pleasure in learning that this thug was arrested and later expelled, and had a few misdemeanor charges upgraded to a felonious crime\u2014but not more than I would have taken pleasure if someone\u2014anyone\u2014had handed her ass to her. By that, I mean call on the ancestors, lace up those sneakers, take off them earrings, tie down that hair, grease up that face, crack your knuckles, do some jumping jacks, throw them \u2019bows and tear the club up.\n\nThat did not occur because\u2014and I salute Rowe\u2014of Rowe\u2019s reservation. She was raised right. She is the embodiment of black-girl grace. She is a much better woman than I.\n\n\n\nBrianna Brochu is not.\n\nIn her last public post, she referred to Rowe as \u201cJamaican Barbie.\u201d This tells us all we need to know about how subordinate insipid whiteness feels in close proximity to magical melanin. I\u2019m willing to gamble that Brochu has a Barbie complex that Rowe\u2019s physicality aggravated by far exceeding a perceived beauty standard Brochu cannot identify within herself. It made her sick\u2014and in return, she made Rowe sick, literally.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrochu\u2019s inability to appreciate black excellence juxtaposed with her own mediocrity is attached to the sick and twisted irony of hating black girls while having a deep desire to be one. Brochu goes by @braids_by_breezy for a standalone Instagram account that has since been made private. Instagram users were dragging her. On that account, she showcased her hair-braiding capabilities (perhaps she can use those skills in jail). There were photos of plaits and cornrows with extensions. One image boasted: \u201cstarting the dreads.\u201d It is dreadful.\n\nYet, according to Heavy, Brochu ridiculed Rowe\u2019s bundles in a separate photo used on social media: \u201cThis b[i]tch legit bought a box of f[u]cking hair,\u201d the caption read.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack women\u2019s ability to lay it down, flip it and reverse it with their hair, style and attitude is high art. I can see how the inability to possess such moxie would prompt white woman tears. For Brochu, it triggered white rage. Thus, we should not be quick to dismiss Brochu\u2019s behavior as a case of jealousy. Her motivation and subtleties are nothing less than those of her white male contemporaries.\n\nShe is dangerous.\n\nAnd not in the mean-white-girl-who doesn\u2019t-like-the-black-girl kinda way but, rather, an Americanist-white-supremacist-who-hates-smart-beautiful-black-people-who-make-white-trash-feel-uncomfortably-dumb-ugly-and-irrelevant kinda way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe is dangerous in a \u201cDylann Roof shoots and kills nine people in a Charleston, S.C., church\u201d kinda way.\n\nShe is noxious in a \u201cJames Harris Jackson stabs to death Timothy Caughman for being black\u201d kinda way.\n\nShe is malevolent in a \u201cwhite supremacists murder James Byrd Jr., in a lynch-by-dragging romp\u201d kinda way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe is malignant in an \u201cNYC cop Justin Volpe sodomizes Haitian immigrant Abner Louima with a plunger\u201d kinda way.\n\nShe is depraved in a \u201cMichael Griffith chased to his death in Howard Beach by Jon Lester and his white crew\u201d kinda way.\n\nShe is evil in a \u201c14-year-old Emmett Till lynched for flirting with a white woman\u201d kinda way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo matter how many kinds of ways I present this, nor the distance between South Jamaica and Springfield Gardens, the same resounding story rings true.\n\nBrianna Brochu is a terrorist.\n\nShe\u2019s lucky to have not encountered a black woman, from South Jamaica, who doesn\u2019t have a problem with laying hands on her.", "keywords": ["kinda", "jamaica", "justiceforjazzy", "rowe", "wayshe", "black", "white", "south", "look", "woman", "jazzy", "brochu", "rowes"], "polarity": -0.03592068097387245, "subjectivity": 0.4467988394584139},

Both players tried to pull their jerseys over their mouths to prevent lipreading, but it looks like the conversation was caught on tape.\n\nAfter the game, James had this to say about his talk with Ball, NBC Sports reports:\n\nI don\u2019t see the reaction because I don\u2019t get involved in it. I don\u2019t do it to get a reaction. I do it because he\u2019s said over and over since he was growing up and who he modeled his game after. And who was his favorite player? And it was me, and I was humbled by that. So me wishing him a happy birthday was kind of a salute back to him. I see all the stupid noise that happens, and I can\u2019t buy a place in L.A.

The small neighborhood is almost considered a quiet suburb of New York City. Quiet\u2014it is not. Suburban\u2014kinda, sorta, but not quite. Sure, there were blocks of tree-lined streets, houses and backyards with grassy knolls, but it also included the 40s projects, the Baisley houses, crack addicts and drug dealers.\n\nMy hood struck a perfect balance of the world I would face as an adult. On one hand, it could be warm and embracing\u2014on the other, it was cold and calculating. Living in South Jamaica shaped you to thrive in both, but most importantly, the latter. Being exposed to less-conservative conditions gives you grit. The kind of grit a black girl needs to survive psychopathic white chicks when she goes off to college. The type of grit University of Hartford student Jazzy Rowe needed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRowe, also from Queens, grew up in the neighboring Springfield Gardens community, less than 3 miles from South Jamaica. She recently graduated from my alma mater.\n\nReportedly, she was secretly poisoned, over a period of time, by Brianna Brochu, a white student, with whom she shared a dorm room. In a string of Instagram posts, this poor excuse for trashiness described the ways in which she methodically sabotaged Rowe\u2019s personal items with her bodily fluid.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnbeknownst to Rowe, Brochu shared that she had licked Rowe\u2019s eating utensils and plates, spit in her coconut oil, smeared her knapsack with bloody tampons\u2014and tainted her toothbrush with shit. In addition, Brochu admitted to contaminating Rowe\u2019s face lotion with \u201cmoldy clam dip\u201d and tampering with \u201cso much more.\u201d\n\nRowe became mysteriously ill. She suffered from a bacterial infection that wreaked havoc in her throat, for nearly a month, and required antibiotics. She shared the details of the incident in a Facebook Live video. In a police report, she confirmed that her shared living situation was devoid of social interaction. She stated that her roommate barely acknowledged her presence, had a mean vibe, disrespected her and shut off lights while she studied.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRowe requested a room change, and on the day she moved out, a fellow dorm resident and two assistants confronted her with Brochu\u2019s social media posts, detailing the vile behavior toward Rowe. Brochu\u2019s alleged actions were reported to the university and then West Hartford, Conn., police. There were no reports of anyone becoming \u201cextremely pissed.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe reasonable ending stresses the difference between growing up in South Jamaica in my day and being reared in Springfield Gardens today. There is no way I could have remained civil in that matter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI take pleasure in learning that this thug was arrested and later expelled, and had a few misdemeanor charges upgraded to a felonious crime\u2014but not more than I would have taken pleasure if someone\u2014anyone\u2014had handed her ass to her. By that, I mean call on the ancestors, lace up those sneakers, take off them earrings, tie down that hair, grease up that face, crack your knuckles, do some jumping jacks, throw them \u2019bows and tear the club up.\n\nThat did not occur because\u2014and I salute Rowe\u2014of Rowe\u2019s reservation. She was raised right. She is the embodiment of black-girl grace. She is a much better woman than I.\n\n\n\nBrianna Brochu is not.\n\nIn her last public post, she referred to Rowe as \u201cJamaican Barbie.\u201d This tells us all we need to know about how subordinate insipid whiteness feels in close proximity to magical melanin. I\u2019m willing to gamble that Brochu has a Barbie complex that Rowe\u2019s physicality aggravated by far exceeding a perceived beauty standard Brochu cannot identify within herself. It made her sick\u2014and in return, she made Rowe sick, literally.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrochu\u2019s inability to appreciate black excellence juxtaposed with her own mediocrity is attached to the sick and twisted irony of hating black girls while having a deep desire to be one. Brochu goes by @braids_by_breezy for a standalone Instagram account that has since been made private. Instagram users were dragging her. On that account, she showcased her hair-braiding capabilities (perhaps she can use those skills in jail). There were photos of plaits and cornrows with extensions. One image boasted: \u201cstarting the dreads.\u201d It is dreadful.\n\nYet, according to Heavy, Brochu ridiculed Rowe\u2019s bundles in a separate photo used on social media: \u201cThis b[i]tch legit bought a box of f[u]cking hair,\u201d the caption read.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack women\u2019s ability to lay it down, flip it and reverse it with their hair, style and attitude is high art. I can see how the inability to possess such moxie would prompt white woman tears. For Brochu, it triggered white rage. Thus, we should not be quick to dismiss Brochu\u2019s behavior as a case of jealousy. Her motivation and subtleties are nothing less than those of her white male contemporaries.\n\nShe is dangerous.\n\nAnd not in the mean-white-girl-who doesn\u2019t-like-the-black-girl kinda way but, rather, an Americanist-white-supremacist-who-hates-smart-beautiful-black-people-who-make-white-trash-feel-uncomfortably-dumb-ugly-and-irrelevant kinda way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe is dangerous in a \u201cDylann Roof shoots and kills nine people in a Charleston, S.C., church\u201d kinda way.\n\nShe is noxious in a \u201cJames Harris Jackson stabs to death Timothy Caughman for being black\u201d kinda way.\n\nShe is malevolent in a \u201cwhite supremacists murder James Byrd Jr., in a lynch-by-dragging romp\u201d kinda way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe is malignant in an \u201cNYC cop Justin Volpe sodomizes Haitian immigrant Abner Louima with a plunger\u201d kinda way.\n\nShe is depraved in a \u201cMichael Griffith chased to his death in Howard Beach by Jon Lester and his white crew\u201d kinda way.\n\nShe is evil in a \u201c14-year-old Emmett Till lynched for flirting with a white woman\u201d kinda way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo matter how many kinds of ways I present this, nor the distance between South Jamaica and Springfield Gardens, the same resounding story rings true.\n\nBrianna Brochu is a terrorist.\n\nShe\u2019s lucky to have not encountered a black woman, from South Jamaica, who doesn\u2019t have a problem with laying hands on her.", "keywords": ["kinda", "jamaica", "justiceforjazzy", "rowe", "wayshe", "black", "white", "south", "look", "woman", "jazzy", "brochu", "rowes"], "polarity": -0.03592068097387245, "subjectivity": 0.4467988394584139},

I love the \u201990s vibe and the homage to In Living Color in the video. Bruno Mars is dope as hell, but Cardi really makes this song for me.

Nothing against Migos, but she brings all the energy to this song. Nicki is good, but as VSB\u2019s Panama Jackson said to me when we discussed it, she does what Nicki always does.\n\nCardi, however, comes extra hard. She\u2019s had her come up. It\u2019s still happening for her, and she wants to continue this ride for as long as possible. She brings her A game, and she gives us everything we want from her: sex, feminine bravado, fast rhymes that show us that Cardi B attitude, and a readiness to battle even Nicki Minaj to get that crown.\n\nAnd yes, she is the trap Selena, because we will do anything for Belcalis.\n\n\u201cBartier Cardi,\u201d Cardi\u2019s latest single from her forthcoming album, is in the No. 7 spot. It moved up from the No. 9 spot and features rapper 21 Savage. It\u2019s growing on me. It\u2019s basically \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d with a dude rapping on it, and that is what makes it work.

But at least the ball of justice seems to be rolling now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking of justice, Brochu is still facing the relatively weak charges of third-degree criminal mischief and second-degree breach of peace, but the New York Times reports that the West Hartford, Conn., Police Department said it would be requesting that Brochu be slapped with a felony charge of intimidation based on bigotry or bias, which sounds a lot more like it.\n\nEarlier:\n\nA white University of Hartford freshman, who is apparently as nasty and as vindictive as they come, has been arrested after weeks of systematically contaminating her black roommate\u2019s living space in an effort to get her to move out, authorities say.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrianna Rae Brochu, 18, was arrested Saturday and is facing charges of third-degree criminal mischief and second-degree breach of peace after police say she boasted about rubbing used tampons on her black roommate\u2019s bag and contaminating her eating utensils, toothbrush and other beauty products, according to the Hartford Courant.\n\nChennel \u201cJazzy\u201d Rowe, who is also a freshman at the Connecticut school, said that she had gotten a bad vibe from Brochu from day one.\n\n\u201cI kind of felt unwanted and she was giving off vibes,\u201d Rowe told Fox 61.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t until Oct. 17, when Rowe finally moved out, that she realized her roommate had been systematically attacking her in the nastiest of ways.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cShe asked me if I was moving out and I simply said \u2018Yup,\u2019 and she made a face and said \u2018OK,\u2019 and then I saw her pick up her phone and automatically start texting,\u201d Rowe said.\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t the case, authorities say; Brochu was actually posting to Instagram, boasting that she had gotten rid of \u201cJamaican Barbie\u201d using the nastiest methods possible.\n\n\u201cFinally did it yo girl got rid of her roommate!! After 1 1/2 month of spitting in her coconut oil, putting moldy clam dip in her lotions, rubbing used tampons [on] her backpack, putting her toothbrush places where the sun doesn\u2019t shine and so much more I can finally say goodbye Jamaican Barbie,\u201d Brochu wrote in the caption of photos posted on Instagram.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRowe does not follow Brochu on Instagram but says she learned of the incident after one of her resident assistants showed her the posts.\n\nRowe immediately went to the university\u2019s public-safety office as well as West Hartford police and filed a police report, but, she said, the school originally told her that she may or may not hear back about the offenses committed against her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Oct. 18, Rowe was asked to sign a \u201cno contact agreement,\u201d meaning that she would have no communication with Brochu. Rowe says that the school threatened to remove her from campus if she was caught talking about what happened to her.\n\nBut she refused to be silenced. Increasingly frustrated with how she was treated, not only by her roommate but apparently by her school as well, Rowe took to Facebook Live, detailing the horrific story in a lengthy video.\n\nIn the video, Rowe detailed what Brochu did to her and also told of how she had been getting sick continually, an alarming fact given that her living quarters were apparently badly contaminated because of her nasty-ass roommate from hell.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhile I\u2019ve been here, I\u2019ve been getting sick. Not knowing why, I\u2019ve been getting sick. It started with throat pain. I thought maybe because it\u2019s colder up here, I\u2019m just probably catching a cold,\u201d Rowe said. \u201cThe sore throat pain got worse and it was just throat pain. And this was happening for about a month. It got to the point where I had extreme throat pain where I couldn\u2019t sleep, to the point where I couldn\u2019t speak. Like, I\u2019d try to whisper and I could barely whisper.\u201d\n\nRowe said that she went to the campus medical center and was prescribed antibiotics, but doctors could not figure out what was wrong. Three tests came back negative, and doctors could only say that there was \u201csome type of bad bacteria\u201d in the back of her throat that was causing the pain.\n\nIn a Facebook post, Rowe also voiced her frustration with the university, unconvinced that the situation would have been handled this way if the roles were reversed:\n\nColleges are known to just sweep issues that happen within the campus under the rug, making the issue disappear and not doing anything about it. Now this isn\u2019t right at all and this is where the public gets involved to push for things to be done right. I\u2019m not holding my tongue any longer about my situation because this is just ridiculous to hear nothing back from my school about this situation. As a African American woman I have to fight for myself and others to not become some statistic. ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe also said in the video, according to Heavy:\n\nAnd the fact I\u2019m black and my old roommate was white, if the roles was switched ... I want to know if it would be handled the same way? I damn well know it wouldn\u2019t. \u2026 I feel like me as a black person and her being a white person, if I\u2019m the woman who committed all these crimes, this would\u2019ve been completely different. \u2026 There were so many crimes committed, that she openly posted. \u2026 I would\u2019ve been locked up already, they would have had no hesitation, cuffed me and taken me away. I\u2019m just so aggravated.\n\nOf course, now that Rowe has gone public, the university is singing a different tune, and saying that it will provide support during the investigation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cUpon learning of the incident, Public Safety immediately ensured that the victim was relocated to a safe location, notified local authorities, and provided support for their investigation,\u201d the school said in a statement. \u201cThe accused student was subsequently arrested by the West Hartford Police Department and her case will proceed through the legal process. The university will continue to precisely execute our defined process outlined in the Code of Student Conduct.\u201d\n\nThe school also insisted that it did its due diligence, calling any other information to the contrary \u201cbased on misinformation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe incident has brought about accusations of racism, and I want you to know that I hear and share your anger and frustration. Acts of racism, bias, bullying, or other abusive behaviors will not be tolerated on this campus. I pledge to do everything in my power to work with our community to address related concerns together,\u201d school President Greg Woodward added in the statement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for Beckzilla Brochu, because white womanhood, she is currently free on $1,000 bail and is due back in court Wednesday, according to Heavy. Both of her charges are Class B misdemeanors, meaning that they would carry a maximum sentence of six months in prison and possibly a fine.\n\nThe Courant notes that Brochu attempted to play the victim, saying that she \u201cbegan to lash out due to a \u2018hostile environment\u2019 caused by [the victim\u2019s] rude behavior, not compromising and posting Snapchat videos of me sleeping and making fun of me snoring.\u201d\n\nSo, because of someone allegedly being rude and posting Snapchat videos of you sleeping, your next level of action and the response that you deem appropriate is rubbing your period blood all over the person\u2019s bag and licking her plate, fork and spoon?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy the way, Brochu did confess to licking Rowe\u2019s eating utensils and smearing blood on her backpack, but she denied any other actions she posted about on Instagram, claiming that it \u201cwas a lie in an attempt to \u2018appear funny.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Beckery.\n\nMeanwhile, social media is rallying behind Rowe, starting the hashtag #JusticeForJazzy and demanding that the University of Hartford stop talking about it and instead just be about it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement", "keywords": ["rowe", "im", "expelled", "used", "white", "rubbing", "school", "university", "space", "roommates", "throat", "living", "tampons", "freshman", "black", "brochu", "roommate", "hartford"], "polarity": -0.03695306071339131, "subjectivity": 0.4264346535007693},

Maybe that\u2019s why he\u2019s been so nimble at dressing die-hard fans like EGOT Whoopi Goldberg, who sat front-row at his show Saturday, along with rap \u201cit\u201d girl Cardi B, dressed head to toe in a money-green suit with a white mink stole tossed over her shoulder for good measure.

It was an adorable gimmick, and enough to raise the question: Is Cross Colours due for a comeback?\n\nLaunched in 1989 by Carl Jones and T.J. Walker, the black-owned urban-streetwear label marketed itself as \u201cclothing without prejudice\u201d and was a perfect fit for the era of new jack swing, a Fresh Prince and \u201chappy\u201d hip-hop\u2014not to mention how well the clothing coordinated with our African medallions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDistinguished by boxy silhouettes\u2014worn intentionally even more oversized, of course\u2014Cross Colours\u2019 trademark bright-hued schemes were initially inspired by a swatch of kente cloth, as Walker told Bobby Kim\u2019s The Hundreds magazine in 2014:\n\nIt elevated into a lifestyle, a collection, a look, a style. It morphed. ... For us, the colors were not only for the people, but for the fabric, for the thread, for the united force of people. Gang violence was also very prevalent at that time. So then we said Cross Colours for all that too \u2013 to unite the colors of the gangs.\n\nThe brand was a hit, dominating the early-\u201990s urban-fashion landscape, and seen on everyone from Muhammad Ali to Paula Abdul. And then, just as quickly as it peaked, it fell, due in large part to its affiliation with Merry-Go-Round\u2014one of the era\u2019s premier fast-fashion retailers\u2014which declared bankruptcy and defaulted upon millions of dollars in orders from Cross Colours in the process.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe downward spiral would continue as trademarks changed hands; eventually leading the brand to become dormant for the next two decades.\n\nBut if Cross Colours\u2019 appearance on the Grammy stage came as a surprise to most, it\u2019s only because Walker and Jones have taken a tactical approach to quietly rebuilding their brand, beginning to harness the power of social media several years ago to gauge the interest of, and access to, a new generation, as they told Kim in 2014:\n\nWe\u2019re trying to sort out how we really want to present ourselves. ... Is it all vintage? Do we have better pricing? Higher pricing? So we\u2019re going through that \u2013 the motions right now. And what do we really mean to the consumer today? It\u2019s a younger, different generation. Do they know our brand?

Military-inspired looks and message T-shirts are in abundance, as well as a surprisingly sexy underwear line perfectly made for peeking out of the waistband of your saggy jeans.\n\nAnd while we\u2019re not sure we\u2019re ready to rock rainbow stripes again (sorry, Cardi), we have to admit that just seeing the brand back in action takes us back to a happier time and place.

You probably recognize that combination of words and syllables from Black Moon\u2019s 1993 song \u201cWho Got da Props?\u201d off of their Enta da Stage album. But they asked a very important question, and the answer to that question is undoubtedly Belcalis Almanzar, better known to the world as Cardi B.\n\nI\u2019ve been racking my brain trying to think of who could possibly have had a better 2017 than she. Hell, her 2018 is even going well. She managed to get on the stage at the Grammys and perform with Bruno Mars\u2014the night\u2019s big winner\u2014and then end up in a freakin\u2019 Super Bowl commercial for Amazon.com\u2019s Alexa.\n\nLove her or hate her\u2014and I honestly don\u2019t know how you can hate her\u2014her glow up is real, happening on her own terms, and ultimately, she seems to be truly enjoying it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsider this: She\u2019s managed to be the first woman\u2014not Beyonc\u00e9, Nicki Minaj, Lauryn Hill, Alicia Keys\u2014to have five songs simultaneously featured in the top 10 on Billboard\u2019s Hot R&B/Hip-Hop chart. She had the indisputable song of 2017 in \u201cBodak Yellow,\u201d reaching No. 1 on the pop charts. While Nicki had a much better verse on Migos\u2019 \u201cMotorSport,\u201d half of the times I\u2019ve heard the song, the DJ cut it off after Cardi\u2019s verse. That makes NO sense, but also, I get it. This is the world we live in. Cardi B hopped on Bruno Mars\u2019 song \u201cFinesse\u201d and with the awesome video became even more endearing. I don\u2019t even know how that\u2019s possible.\n\nConsidering where most of us first saw her, I\u2019m not even sure there\u2019s a word to describe her ascent. Like most folks, I first saw her on Love & Hip Hop through DJ Self as he was trying to work with her and not work with her at the same time. She was the hotheaded Dominican from the South Bronx, N.Y., with \u201cthe teeth\u201d\u2014she got a bag and fixed those\u2014who was dating the dude in prison. She couldn\u2019t quite get anybody to check out her music in a real way.\n\nNow? She lives on the charts, performs at the Grammys, is engaged to a Migo(s), is in Super Bowl commercials and gives hilarious interviews on red carpets. Of her appearance at the Grammys, she managed to say that she had butterflies in both her stomach and her vagina, and I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s the new standard now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can understand the hesitation on the part of hip-hoppers to heap too much praise on her. She is, after all, a rapper. And I\u2019m not sure anybody would be rushing to crown her the queen of rap, especially when Nicki Minaj and Remy Ma are out there. They\u2019re rappers. Cardi B is more of a personality who decided to do like so many others: use music as her vehicle to doing something other than starving. They\u2019re not really in it for the craft; they\u2019re in it for the money.\n\nBecause I\u2019m a hip-hop head who will fight anybody over the \u201990s, I get the difficulty in being happy about this. BUT I\u2019m also a person who believes that anybody with limitations who maximizes on their opportunities and doesn\u2019t burn down the industry along the way isn\u2019t ruining the culture. She\u2019s not Vanilla Ice or Snow. Or Bo$$, who famously faked her entire life and upbringing to become a gangsta rapper. She\u2019s the real MC Gusto from CB4.\n\nCardi has both put herself and been put in positions where she could make the most of them or fumble, and thus far, she\u2019s kicked asses and taken names. By being what I can only presume is authentically her and releasing music that absolutely beats, she\u2019s gained fans and people who aren\u2019t fans but are running out of reasons to hate her. She\u2019s winning; why hate on somebody who is winning with a smile by being her best self, flaws and all?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Facebook, I saw a friend of mine point out that Cardi B should probably have been considered for best new artist at the Grammys. And that\u2019s absolutely true. The way the Grammys are set up, I\u2019m guessing she\u2019ll be up for that award in 2022. But no other artist in the past six months has gone from \u201cWe think we heard of her\u201d to being a damn-near household name like she has. People genuinely like her, and you can\u2019t force personal gravity.\n\nEarly on, I was on the struggle-to-find-the-reason-we-should-care-about-Cardi bandwagon, but somewhere along the way, I had to acknowledge that I kept saying I didn\u2019t like her but knew all the words to \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d and enjoyed her random, sometimes entirely nonsensical Instagram musings and even follow her on IG, and wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt when she got problematic.\n\nAt some point, you just have to give people their credit for doing things their way and managing to be super successful at them. That is Cardi. Do I think she\u2019ll be around for the next 10 years as an artist of note? I honestly have no idea. Maybe there\u2019s an artist in there trying to get out that will surprise us all. Or maybe not. Maybe we\u2019ve seen what she has to offer, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll keep getting until we all collectively don\u2019t want it anymore. Whatever the output, Cardi B got now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd for that come up?

I\u2019m also betting we\u2019ll be seeing more ring-divided braids this spring and summer.\n\nBut most striking is how Mon\u00e1e skillfully reminds us from whence we came, and that the future is indeed black and female. As she says, \u201cHit the mute button, let the vagina have a monologue.\u201d\n\nBut while \u201cDjango Jane\u201d is a banger, Mon\u00e1e still knows how to serve up a bop, and \u201cMake Me Feel\u201d definitely delivers.

From Blue Ivy letting us know she runs the Knowles-Carter household, to everyone with white roses in support of Time\u2019s Up, Kendrick Lamar\u2019s American satire and Kesha\u2019s powerful Time\u2019s Up-esque performance (featuring Cyndi Lauper, Camila Cabello, Andra Day and more), taking a stand has become an important thread in the makeup of an artist. \u201cWe come in peace, but we mean business,\u201d said Janelle Mon\u00e1e, carrying the torch for equality for women with her Grammys appearance.\n\nMon\u00e1e shook the table with her speech:\n\nTonight, I am proud to stand in solidarity as not just an artist, but a young woman, with my fellow sisters in this room who make up the music industry\u2014artists, writers, assistants, publicists, CEOs, producers, engineers and women from all sectors of the business. We are also daughters, wives, mothers, sisters and human beings. To those who would dare try and silence us, we offer you two words: #TimesUp. We say time\u2019s up for pay inequality, discrimination or harassment of any kind, and the abuse of power.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGrammy nominees Logic and Khalid, alongside Grammy winner Alessia Cara, performed their powerful nominated song, \u201c1-800-273-8255.\u201d The song, about suicide, was a shift not only in the culture but also in the room, with the performers bringing a group of suicide survivors and family members of suicide victims onstage with them. Logic ended the performance with a stance on immigration policy, saying, \u201cBring us your tired, your poor and any immigrant who seeks refuge.\u201d\n\nTo say there were important moments at the Grammys this year is to make an understatement. Check out some of the best moments from the 2018 Grammys:\n\n\n\nKendrick Opens\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 2018 Grammys opened in a big way with Kendrick Lamar giving us a powerful political performance complete with American flags and marching soldiers. With tears in his eyes, Lamar rapped a mile a minute to songs like \u201cXXX,\u201d \u201cDNA\u201d and \u201cKing\u2019s Dead,\u201d marching alongside the soldiers and introducing us to his satire. The screens behind him read, \u201cThis is a satire by Kendrick Lamar.\u201d Men in red hoodies fell to the ground every time Lamar extended his arm to shoot them.\n\n\n\nAs if that wasn\u2019t entertaining enough, Lamar brought out U2\u2019s Bono and the Edge and Dave Chappelle! Chappelle reminded the audience, \u201cThe only thing more frightening than watching a black man be honest in America is being a an honest black man in America.\u201d Message! Then out came a black female drummer, not only giving you African realness, but sis danced, too! Lamar better give us Motherland! \u201cIs this on cable?\u201d Chappelle asked, because Lamar was out here giving the world the realness.\n\n\n\nBy the time Lamar went onstage, he was already the winner of three Grammys. He won for best rap performance, best rap album and best music video for \u201cHumble.\u201d He and Rihanna also won best rap/sung performance for \u201cLoyalty.\u201d I\u2019m like congrats to Lamar and all, but Rihanna in that monochromatic vinyl moment was worth fawning over.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOh, and I couldn\u2019t get enough of Rihanna busting out the South African dance the gwara gwara!\n\n\n\nThe All-Black Church Choir During Sam Smith\u2019s Performance\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSam Smith was accompanied by a black church choir that stood behind him giving nothing but strong black women who were all fresh out the salon. Sam sang down on his single \u201cPray\u201d as the choir served us Baptist church.\n\nChuck Berry and Fats Domino Tribute\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJon Batiste and Gary Clark Jr. laced the stage with more rock \u2019n\u2019 roll than the Grammys deserved with their Chuck Berry and Fats Domino tribute. Late Show bandleader Batiste\u2019s laid-back style was a perfect complement to Clark\u2019s funky style. From Domino\u2019s \u201cAin\u2019t That a Shame\u201d to Berry\u2019s \u201cMaybelline,\u201d the performance reminded us all of Berry\u2019s and Domino\u2019s undeniable contributions to music.\n\n\n\nBlue Ivy Shushing Mommy and Daddy\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYeah, these front-row seats to the Grammys are great and all, but chill, Mom and Dad, you\u2019re embarrassing me.\u201d We all go through that phase where our parents are less superhero and more super annoying. I wonder what that\u2019s going to look like for Blue Ivy because she clearly runs the entire compound of the Knowles-Carters.\n\n\n\nChildish Gambino Performance\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI felt like I was in the middle of a \u201990s sex scene in a classic black movie. Donald Glover sang \u201cTerrified\u201d and the vibes of the entire show changed. There are moments during many shows when singers bring out their backup singers to riff together. One of the most iconic was when Mariah Carey brought out Trey Lorenz during a performance of \u201cI\u2019ll Be There,\u201d and going forward, everyone wanted to hear that version of the song. Glover brought out child actor J.D. McCrary (who is featured on the song), and he is easily a vocal genius.\n\n\n\nGlover was quietly impressive. He\u2019s well on his way to EGOT territory, as he\u2019s already holding two Emmys and a Grammy. An Oscar and a Tony aren\u2019t far-fetched.\n\n\n\nDave Chappelle Shades Whole Show Over Tribe Called Quest Snub\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDave Chappelle was asked to present the award for the best rap album, and he did so, in a very Chappelle way. He gave several shoutouts, including one to A Tribe Called Quest, calling them all out by name, then making a reference to the group\u2019s 2016 album, We Got It from Here ... Thank You 4 Your Service.\n\n\u201cI have so much love and respect to all the nominees tonight,\u201d Chappelle began, \u201cand I just want to take a moment to honor Jarobi, Ali Shaheed Muhammad, Q-Tip, sometimes Busta, sometimes Consequence and, of course, always and forever Phife Dawg. Can we kick it?\u201d\n\nAnd then Kendrick Lamar won the Grammy, giving him his fifth win for the night! \u201cGod up top all the time,\u201d Lamar said. \u201cI thought it was about the accolades, the cars and clothes, but it\u2019s really about expressing yourself and putting that paint on the canvas for the world to evolve for the next generation and the next.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUgh, Kendrick Lamar for president!\n\n(Sidenote: When Dave Chappelle won the Grammy for best comedy album, mostly what he had to say in his acceptance speech was, \u201cSee you Monday.\u201d)\n\n\n\nCardi B and Bruno Mars Drippin\u2019 in \u2018Finesse\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s hard to watch Cardi B without being excited thinking of her meteoric rise and smiling. I\u2019m just so proud of her, out here getting nominated and performing at her first Grammys! Being nominated up against Jay-Z and Kendrick Lamar is crazy and, yes, \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d still slaps.\n\nIt was great seeing Grammy god Bruno Mars and Cardi kill their In Living Color tribute of a performance on the Grammys stage. Bruno\u2019s dance break hyped the crowd up with the best \u201990s moves you\u2019ve seen since House Party.\n\nShaggy Kept Coming Out With Sting\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSting wants us to know that he\u2019s all about the islands with his new collaboration with Shaggy. From their subway skit (that went on way too long) with the show\u2019s host, James Corden, to their performance, I felt force-fed, but I am honestly curious about this odd couple.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s evidently a joint album coming, and they sang \u201cDon\u2019t Make Me Wait,\u201d which actually does slap. I\u2019m low-key excited for this unlikely pairing. I might be lying.\n\n\n\nShemar Moore and Eve Introducing SZA\u2019s Performance\n\nWhat\u2019s black as hell? Having actor and picture-of-perfection Shemar Moore and rapper and host Eve introducing SZA to the stage for her first Grammys performance. And SZA went off!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd my feelings are a little bit hurt that SZA was the most nominated woman at the Grammys this year and left with nothing. I\u2019m glad she didn\u2019t win for best new artist. We all know that curse.\n\n\n\nFire and Fury Spoken-Word Auditions\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of host James Corden\u2019s skits consisted of various celebrities with not-so-positive opinions on your president sitting down to do dramatic readings of the book Fire and Fury. The lineup was perfect: John Legend, Snoop Dogg, Cher, Cardi B and Hillary Clinton. The skit was glorious.\n\nAnd an honorable mention goes to Cardi B\u2019s red-carpet moment with E! host Giuliana Rancic. When she asked Cardi how she was feeling, Cardi cardi-ed and said: \u201cI\u2019m feeling good. I\u2019m feeling nervous, overwhelmed, everything. Butterflies in my stomach and vagina.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was clear Rancic couldn\u2019t remember the Cardi B lyrics she desperately wanted to summon; nor could she handle Cardi (or Lil Uzi Vert, for that matter), but Cardi handled her own and made for another hilarious, viral moment.\n\n\n\nDid you watch the 2018 Grammys?

Blige\u2019s glow up this awards season; in fact, we\u2019re not sure we\u2019ve stanned this hard for her since What\u2019s the 411? The singer and actress has been nominated for Golden Globe, Critics Choice and Screen Actors Guild awards, and now a history-making two Oscar nods for both her performance and original song in Dee Rees\u2019 Mudbound. And she has stunned us on every single red carpet.\n\nBut those stunning looks have a secret weapon in a longtime member of Blige\u2019s team: celebrity makeup artist D\u2019Andre Michael. Knowing how much we wanted the 411 on Blige\u2019s super-fly SAG Awards look, Michael let The Glow Up in on a surprisingly low-priced secret: He exclusively used products from Black Opal.\n\nYes, THAT Black Opal (its Instagram is kind of poppin\u2019, by the way). In Michael\u2019s words:\n\nI\u2019ve been working with Mary J. Blige for years, and I love trying new looks on her. I wanted to create a showstopping look using Black Opal for her first-time appearance at the SAG Awards. Once I saw her gown, I knew I wanted to transform her into an elegant smoked goddess.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe was smokin\u2019 indeed, styled by fashion fave Law Roach in a one-shouldered black-and-white gown with a dramatic wing motif by designer Jean-Louis Sabaji.\n\nMichael, who\u2019s been on Blige\u2019s team for over a decade, complemented her dress and sleek modern hairstyle with a perfect smoky eye atop glowing skin, using Black Opal all the way. He shared with The Glow Up why, after years of working with the superstar, this awards season is such a special one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up: As a longtime member of Mary J. Blige\u2019s team, what\u2019s it like to work with her during this groundbreaking phase of her career?\n\nD\u2019Andre Michael: Having been with Mary J. Blige now for 11 years, we are more like family. I am so proud and honored to be a part of this moment with her. I\u2019m happy and overjoyed with her continued success, but this is like the stepping-stone to something I know she has been passionate [about]. It\u2019s amazing to see the acknowledgment and praise she is receiving for her work as an actress. I\u2019m like a proud brother.\n\nTGU: Mary\u2019s looks have been phenomenal at every event. How are you able to keep her looks so fresh?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDM: I have been with her every step of the way: Every award show, every red carpet, press junket, television show, etc. It\u2019s always been my thing to make her look good every time.\n\nMaybe because she\u2019s on a different platform now, a broader audience is taking note, but nothing has changed much with what we do. It\u2019s being there as a support for her in all that she\u2019s going through personally, making sure her spirits are up and she feels good about herself and comfortable with how she looks, what she\u2019s wearing, etc. So I think what shines through mostly is her \u201chappy\u201d\u2014and when you feel good internally, it shows externally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: You used exclusively Black Opal for Mary\u2019s SAG Awards look. Tell us why we should be checking for drugstore brands, and why Black Opal works so well for our tones?\n\nDM: I have never been one to follow trends or fads, mainly because trends come and go, and fads fade away. However, staying true to myself as an artist and finding things that work for me to use on my clients is most important. That\u2019s above any brand\u2014whether it is department store, drugstore or specialty store.\n\nI have learned just because something has a name brand on it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s suitable for what I need to use it for. Therefore, it is all about the quality of a product, and sometimes the most expensive product isn\u2019t necessarily the best. A lot of my favorite go-to products are drugstore brands.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy friend Sam Fine worked with Black Opal years ago and helped them with their colors and palettes. Even then, I realized It was a brand that I could trust, because he\u2019s an amazing artist that I respect and call a friend. So if Sam trusts them, I know I can.\n\nDM: Black Opal has always been a staple for having a great color range for women of color; from the fairest of women to the darkest, you could trust you are in good hands with the Black Opal brand, and the formula is great. It gives great coverage that you could work with, whether you need a light coverage to a complete coverage. The Black Opal True Color Skin Perfecting Stick Foundation is amazing! It is great to see they are still around and providing women of color and us professionals with great colors and a great formula.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: At 47, Mary looks incredible. Can you talk about how makeup differs for women in her age group?\n\nDM: The only difference is probably the fads and trends you may want to stay away from with a more mature woman. In terms of looks, you definitely want to use less powder and more products that enhance a dewier look.\n\nFor eyes, most to all women can carry a smoky eye. Many think \u201csmoky eye,\u201d and they think black or dark. But you can smoke your eyes with almost any color.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn terms of skin, I like to do my concealer, then apply my foundation, next set with a powder, and maybe spritz your face with a mister or the Evian mist spray to infuse the powder and foundation. Next, let it air-dry to take away the powdered look so you have more of a dewy skin appearance.\n\nIlluminators work as well, but know that sometimes these can come across drab and chalky looking if you use the wrong color. For women of color, I recommend an illuminator in the flesh-tone range (bronzy or mauve, etc.), and stay away from pearl color or yellows or orange-based colors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, even after all that great advice, we couldn\u2019t let Michael go without getting his step-by-step for creating Blige\u2019s SAG look, and all the products he used. How else are we going to plan for our next shopping trip?\n\nFor the Face\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the Eyes\n\nTo sculpt and define Blige\u2019s eyes, Michael used the Black Opal Aurora Eyeshadow Palette. First, he used the Brazen Copper shade on her entire eyelid. Next, he added Brazen Bronze on her crease, adding the Bordeaux Beige shade along the brow bone as a highlight.\n\n\n\nMichael then finished the eye look with Black Opal Color Splurge Automatic Eye Lining Pencil in Licorice, adding it along the lash line and inner lid and smudging to create a smoky look. Note: This eye pencil is formulated with aloe vera and chamomile extracts that help to soothe the delicate eye area as you define it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Lasting Lip\n\nFor the finishing touches to Blige\u2019s look, Michael used Black Opal Lip Color Splurge Stick Lip in Purr, a soft, pale-pink color enriched with emollient butters and vitamins C&E. This lipstick provides a bright, pigment-rich color that provides a smooth, creamy, nondrying finish.\n\nNo word yet on what Blige\u2019s look will be for the 90th Academy Awards on March 4. But even after Michael works his magic, we know the finishing touch will really be Mary J. Blige\u2019s happiness. The Glow Up gang will be watching on our live Facebook group thread and rooting for her\u2014and everybody black!", "keywords": ["love", "awards", "looks", "great", "price", "sag", "michael", "eye", "js", "look", "bliges", "color", "opal", "black", "limit", "mary"], "polarity": 0.24930036777381906, "subjectivity": 0.5446655237584439},

You can catch the entire list of winners here, but it\u2019s safe to say that the big winner of the night was everyone\u2019s favorite regular, degular, schmegular Cinderella story Cardi B, who not only snagged best new artist and best new hip-hop artist wins but also opened the show with a medley of her greatest hits (yes, I know\u2014I was confused by that concept, too, but then I remembered that she\u2019d had five songs in the Billboard Top 10 R&B/Hip-Hop).\n\nAnd in case you thought this event was just for the young\u2019uns, there were a few slightly more mature talents in the mix, including Ne-Yo, Bon Jovi and Ray Parker Jr., who was accompanied by his grown son Jericho.

One of those things that absolutely go Full-On Embarrassing Dad is singing Rick James and Smokey Robinson\u2019s \u201cEbony Eyes\u201d at the top of my lungs WHENEVER it comes on. And because Apple knows my heart, I can pull it up whenever, wherever, whatever the spirit hits me, and buddy, it hits me, baby, not one more time, but all the times.\n\n\u201cEbony Eyes\u201d was released in 1983 and was a single off of Rick James\u2019 Cold Blooded album, featuring the title track, one of Rick\u2019s signature hit songs. James\u2019 career is interesting in that he\u2019s considered a legend in two games, like Pee Wee Kirkland (his drug use was legendary back then), but the most significant part of his career happened between 1978 and 1985. As opposed to other larger-than-life artists whose hits spanned several decades, James made a really big splash over a relatively short amount of time.\n\nWith Motown and music legend Robinson in tow, James wrote an ode to black women that was slower tempo and more traditional R&B than most of his hits.\n\nWhile James was known for the punk-funk stylings of his larger hits, \u201cEbony Eyes\u201d saw him smooth it out and keep it mellow, mellow. Robinson and James traded stanzas, and most of the hook duties went to James, creating one of the absolutely most perfect karaoke songs of all time, since James\u2019 singing is more performance than it is good. And that\u2019s really what karaoke is all about. I love Rick James; that was not a shot.\n\nWhen James and Robinson really ramp up the energy toward the end of the song, this is when my soul fully embraces all that the song has to offer. From roughly 3:30 until the end of the song, every single time James sings \u201cEbony eyyyyyyyyyyyyyyes of miii-iiiiiiiiiine .... ,\u201d I feel the spirit of Mary Jane.\n\nWhile it is nowhere near Rick James\u2019 most famous or most successful song, I\u2019d stack it against \u201cYou and I,\u201d \u201cSuper Freak,\u201d \u201cGive It to Me Baby\u201d or \u201cCold Blooded\u201d as his second-best song of all time, since \u201cMary Jane\u201d is hands down his best song.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut with \u201cEbony Eyes,\u201d we have an ode to black women being sung by the smooth crooner and the super freak, who shot a nonsensical eight-minute mini movie (the year after Michael Jackson\u2019s \u201cThriller,\u201d no less) about their plane, Ebony Eyes, crashing on a beach because of bad weather, and the two of them singing about their ebony-eyed angels back home.\n\nThey build spears, have tiki torches; there\u2019s a parrot; they shave; James throws an SOS note into the ocean; and then a trunk full of white suits\u2014literally, white suits\u2014shows up, they shoot flares, and their women show up on a yacht and rescue them.\n\nIt\u2019s bad, real bad, Joe Jackson.

What makes this even more special is that Cardi is the first person to do it with her first five chart entries.\n\nI know my co-workers, my friends and everyone else around me is tired of hearing me talk about Cardi B. Last week or the week before, I pitched a post I wanted to write about Cardi B to my editor, Yesha Callahan, and your mama was dead-ass like, \u201cNo.\u201d So imagine the joy that went through my body when Corey Townsend, our weekend social editor, posted this news in Slack.\n\nI legit typed in all caps: \u201cME. I WANT TO WRITE THIS. CARDI B IS MY PRESIDENT.\u201d\n\nAnd so now I get to write the post that I pitched in the first place but Yesha turned down. It has a news peg and a new purpose.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy president got me out here winning.\n\nCardi\u2019s songs and features are holding the 1, 3, 4, 7, and 10 spots on the chart.\n\nIn the No. 1 spot is her feature on Bruno Mars\u2019 \u201cFinesse.\u201d This song is a bop. I love the \u201990s vibe and the homage to In Living Color in the video. Bruno Mars is dope as hell, but Cardi really makes this song for me. Plus, I like how she slowed her cadence down and enunciated every word so we understand clearly what she\u2019s saying.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis song moved from No. 16 to No. 1 in its first week. Recognize the talents of the performers. Put some respeck on their names. Don\u2019t @ me.\n\nThis is Cardi\u2019s second appearance in the No. 1 spot. \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d held that position for six weeks from September to October 2017.\n\nG-Eazy\u2019s \u201cNo Limit\u201d is holding down the No. 3, slipping from No. 2 this week. G-Eazy released this in September, capitalizing on the heat Cardi already had going with \u201cBodak Yellow.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCardi didn\u2019t just write a hot verse; she made this a hot song (again, don\u2019t @ me).\n\nI like G-Eazy enough, but I only noticed him because of this song with Cardi; before I heard this song, I had never heard of him.\n\nAnyway, I love this feature for Cardi. My favorite part is when she says, \u201cMy career taking off; these hos jogging in place.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYesssssssssss, Cardi. Do your thing, bitch.\n\n\u201cMotorsport\u201d by Migos is in the No. 4 spot and features Cardi B and Nicki Minaj locked in the most vicious tongue-twisting rhyme battle that ever happened in subs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have always maintained that Cardi was the best thing about this song, too. Nothing against Migos, but she brings all the energy to this song. Nicki is good, but as VSB\u2019s Panama Jackson said to me when we discussed it, she does what Nicki always does.\n\nCardi, however, comes extra hard. She\u2019s had her come up. It\u2019s still happening for her, and she wants to continue this ride for as long as possible. She brings her A game, and she gives us everything we want from her: sex, feminine bravado, fast rhymes that show us that Cardi B attitude, and a readiness to battle even Nicki Minaj to get that crown.\n\nAnd yes, she is the trap Selena, because we will do anything for Belcalis.\n\n\u201cBartier Cardi,\u201d Cardi\u2019s latest single from her forthcoming album, is in the No. 7 spot.

After all, there\u2019s a constant need to know what the kids are into these days, and without kids of my own, it can be tough. Thankfully, we\u2019ve got the annual iHeartRadio Awards to tell us old heads who\u2019s hot and who\u2019s on the come up.\n\nIn fact, last night\u2019s awards show, which took place at the Forum in Inglewood, Calif., could be considered the baby of all the music awards shows, as this year\u2019s ceremony was only its fifth. Launched in 2014, the iHeartRadio Awards celebrate the most popular performers of each year (which totally sets it apart from other awards shows) based on cumulative performance data and listener feedback.\n\nThis year\u2019s ceremony was co-hosted by model/celebrity spawn Hailey Baldwin and DJ Khaled (yes, Asahd was there). You can catch the entire list of winners here, but it\u2019s safe to say that the big winner of the night was everyone\u2019s favorite regular, degular, schmegular Cinderella story Cardi B, who not only snagged best new artist and best new hip-hop artist wins but also opened the show with a medley of her greatest hits (yes, I know\u2014I was confused by that concept, too, but then I remembered that she\u2019d had five songs in the Billboard Top 10 R&B/Hip-Hop).\n\nAnd in case you thought this event was just for the young\u2019uns, there were a few slightly more mature talents in the mix, including Ne-Yo, Bon Jovi and Ray Parker Jr., who was accompanied by his grown son Jericho.

And it is not lost on me that when given a choice between the two, the Recording Academy loves to reward music that sounds black without rewarding actual black people.\n\nIn fact, since 2008, only one black person has won best album at this award show, and I would argue that Herbie Hancock won because he was paying homage to a beloved, soulful white woman. In the past 10 years, more often than not, black artists were shafted by the academy and forced to watch someone with an inferior, less important album take the award that was rightfully theirs. Let\u2019s look back at the Grammys\u2019 10-year record of undervaluing (mostly black) talent.\n\n\n\n2007\n\nWon: Herbie Hancock\u2019s River: The Joni Letters\n\n\n\nBest album that year: Amy Winehouse\u2019s Back to Black\n\n\n\nThis is the one album by a white artist that I could not deny. This was a powerhouse performance from start to finish. Not a single track is a misstep, and it is all the more powerful knowing how little work we would get from this once-in-a-generation talent. I still mourn the work we did not get from Winehouse while celebrating the art she left behind.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2008\n\nWon: Robert Plant and Alison Krauss\u2019 Raising Sand\n\n\n\nBest album that year: Lil Wayne\u2019s Tha Carter III\n\n\n\nTha Carter III was the album on which Wayne lived up good to his claim of being the best rapper alive. While none of his studio albums have the transcendental feel of his best mixtapes, this is the one that came the closest.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2009\n\nWon: Taylor Swift\u2019s Fearless\n\n\n\nBest album that year: Kanye West\u2019s 808s & Heartbreak\n\n\n\nYe redefined what was possible for a hip-hop artist with 808s & Heartbreak. Gone were his witty lyrics and catchy, soulful beats. Instead, he used the medium of Auto-Tune to express his pain while using the androidlike sound to hide emotions a black man, much less a rapper, was not allowed to feel. It is hip-hop\u2019s best brown-liquor album.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2010\n\nWon: Arcade Fire\u2019s The Suburbs\n\n\n\nBest album that year: Drake\u2019s Thank Me Later\n\n\n\nDrake\u2019s first studio album features what we have come to expect from the man who is rarely in but always repping Toronto: slick production, clever lyrics and aloof masculinity masked as emotional vulnerability. For better or worse, this set the tone for much of the music that was to come for the next five years.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2011\n\nWon: Adele\u2019s 21\n\n\n\nBest album that year: Kanye West\u2019s My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\n\n\n\nYes, Adele\u2019s album was dope, but in 2012, Kanye released one of the best albums of all time. \u201cRunaway\u201d is one of the most ambitious songs ever attempted, hip-hop or otherwise, and \u201cLost in the World\u201d is a track that transcends categorization. MBDTF, even with its flaws, is a masterpiece and the strongest argument for why Kanye is one of the most important artists in the last 25 years.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2012\n\nWon: Mumford & Sons\u2019 Babel\n\n\n\nBest album that year: Frank Ocean\u2019s Channel Orange\n\n\n\nI like an album full of philosophical folk songs as much as the next guy, but Frank Ocean\u2019s Channel Orange was monumental. It is an almost perfect album that rewards tarrying with Ocean\u2019s vulnerable lyrical and sonic atmosphere.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2013\n\nWon: Daft Punk\u2019s Random Access Memories\n\n\n\nBest album that year: Kendrick Lamar\u2019s Good Kid, M.A.A.D City\n\n\n\nDaft Punk\u2019s second-best album beat Lamar\u2019s best record to date for best album that year. In 2012, Kung Fu Kenny introduced himself to most of the world with this ambitious, literary concept album that bangs while it challenges the listener. This joint didn\u2019t even win best rap album that year. Proof, if you ever needed it, that you should not put too much stock in white validation of black art.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2014\n\nWon: Beck\u2019s Morning Phase\n\n\n\nBest album that year: Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Beyonc\u00e9\n\n\n\nDo you remember the way Beyonc\u00e9 broke the internet with this album? How America collectively lost sleep one night on Dec. 13, 2013, streaming it, in shock that we\u2019d been blessed with an early Christmas gift? It was not the first \u201csurprise album,\u201d but it was the one that set industry standards about how to release in the streaming era. Why this lost to Beck is beyond me. I liked Morning Phase, but nothing on it made the cultural impact of Bey\u2019s surfboard.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2015\n\nWon: Taylor Swift\u2019s 1989\n\n\n\nBest album that year: D\u2019Angelo\u2019s Black Messiah\n\n\n\nThis could have gone to Lamar\u2019s To Pimp a Butterfly, but for me, Black Messiah should have won the award that year. His sound was both rustic and virtuosic, while the lyrics were urgent without being inaccessible. This was the soul protest album we didn\u2019t know we needed, the rare album that lives up to the multiyear hype.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2016\n\nWon: Adele\u2019s 25\n\n\n\nBest album that year: Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Lemonade\n\n\n\nThis point was made by virtually everyone last year. Even Adele voiced her confusion on the stage (she took that award home, though). At this point, all I can do is shake my head.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2017\n\nWon: Bruno Mars\u2019 24K Magic\n\n\n\nBest album this year: Kendrick Lamar\u2019s DAMN.\n\n\n\nThe psychological depth and cultural impact of DAMN. is still being felt and examined. 24K Magic is fun, but DAMN. is important. Further, to quote Mark Anthony \u201cTha OG\u201d Neal, \u201cI don\u2019t hate \u201cFinesse\u201d; it\u2019s catchy, but Teddy Riley and Bobby Brown want their music back.\u201d Mars may have acknowledged the pioneers of his sound, but I can\u2019t help feeling some kind of way about how he profits off black visionaries who never got their due.\n\n", "keywords": ["award", "albums", "kanye", "white", "lost", "work", "won", "2007", "best", "album", "grammynominated", "black", "lamars"], "polarity": 0.2873538961038961, "subjectivity": 0.4462121212121209},

Appearing for her third supporting actress nod for eventual best picture winner The Shape of Water, the actress and children\u2019s-book author was styled by sister team Wendi and Nicole in an ethereal green gown that evoked the flowing depths of the sea.\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images)\n\nAs we\u2019ve learned from several female celebs who don\u2019t fit the typical Hollywood starlet mold\u2014including being over 40 and not a sample size\u2014it can sometimes be a struggle to find red-carpet-worthy gowns. Christian Siriano and Tadashi Shoji have both become reliable industry sources for all-inclusive glamour, but Spencer nailed her look Sunday night courtesy of one of our fashion faves, Brandon Maxwell (who also dressed best actress winner Alison Janney and our hilarious homegirl Tiffany Haddish for the Vanity Fair after-party Sunday night). In a lovely Instagram post, Maxwell wrote:\n\nI am very proud, with my team, to have dressed Best Supporting Actress nominee @octaviaspencer in a custom emerald green satin faced organza gown for Tonight\u2019s 90th Annual Academy Awards. Octavia makes history tonight with her third nomination, and we are beyond honored to be a part of her special moment.\n\nWhat we loved about this dress is how well the belted silhouette and full, flowing skirt highlighted Spencer\u2019s curvy figure, as well as the deep emerald green, which played to perfection against her brown skin\u2014which we were thrilled to see more of on display. But our favorite aspect by far was the off-the-shoulder neckline, which framed her beautiful face and shoulders, which were grazed by a wavy bob, styled by celebrity hairstylist and groomer David Stanwell.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStanwell began working with Spencer five years ago while at the Cannes Film Festival to promote Fruitvale Station. He says he hit it off with the acclaimed actress the moment they met, telling The Glow Up: \u201cShe has a great sense of humor, and we always have a fun time together. She is professional, and all those elements make for a good work environment.\u201d\n\nThis awards season, Spencer\u2019s hair\u2014which Stanwell tells us is naturally curly and pressed out\u2014has consistently looked stunning, with the actress frequently rocking loose waves to accent her array of red-carpet looks. Stanwell tells us:\n\nOctavia loves curls in the hair\u2014big, medium, and sometimes smaller! We always opt for curls going away from [the] face, and we alternate the tightness depending upon the size of the curling iron. The only time we don\u2019t curl is if we do a slicked-back look with a bun or ponytail. As most award shows are long, we like to stick to simple and practical looks, yet still with a glamorous edge without being too fussy. Our influence always comes from classic and elegant so we always end up in that wheelhouse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Tristan Fewings (Getty Images)\n\nWhile Stanwell is always willing to gently push his star client to try something new and different, he\u2019s also very respectful of her comfort zone and happiness on the red carpet. But when Stanwell saw a sketch of Spencer\u2019s 2018 Oscar gown, he was inspired to take her look shorter to keep the shoulders bare, telling us:\n\nOctavia had sent me the sketch of her dress [last] week, which helped spark my inspiration for [Sunday night\u2019s] look. Instantly, I knew I wanted to do a side part, so that one side was off the shoulder to compliment her dress and jewelry. Octavia liked the idea of a curl, but not too brushed out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStanwell says his secret to keeping Spencer\u2019s hair looking glamorous and healthy is simpler\u2014and far less expensive\u2014than one might think. For Spencer, he\u2019s been relying on a variety of Dove hair products, which, in his words, \u201c[have] helped with that shine and healthy glow that we all want for our hair.\u201d\n\nWe were curious, so he graciously gave The Glow Up a how-to on Spencer\u2019s wavy Oscars bob:\n\n\u201cI started prepping the hair by mixing Dove Style + Care Smooth & Shine Heat Protection Spray and a dollop of Dove Absolute Curls Supreme Cr\u00e8me Serum together to moisturize her hair before applying any heat.\n\n\u201cUsing a large, round brush, I blow-dried her hair to create the desired face-framing shape. We decided on taking the hair shorter [for the night], so after I blow-dried it, I made a deep side part to add more definition to the look.\n\n\u201cAfter I finished blow-drying the hair, I went through it with a 1-inch curling iron to create glamorous, defined waves by twisting the hair toward her face.\n\n\u201cWhile the hair was cooling, I sprayed Dove Style + Care Compressed Micro Mist Flexible Hold Hairspray to give it that extra hold before running my hands through to break up the curls. [Pro tip: Waiting until the hair is cool enough to run one\u2019s fingers through it gives it a fabulous curl that will last all night long.]\n\n\u201cAfter shaping the hair and dressing it around her face, I tucked the curls on the right side of her face behind her ear to give it a romantic feel and show off her jewelry. To finish, I sprayed Dove Style + Care Compressed Micro Mist Flexible Hold Hairspray again throughout the hair to give it a boost of shine.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe have to give credit to Stanwell and Spencer\u2019s entire glam squad for giving one of our screen queens the Cinderella moment she so richly deserved. It\u2019s always exciting to see a star\u2019s style evolve, and while Spencer isn\u2019t known for glamorous roles, we\u2019re hoping to see these gorgeous, age-appropriate (and subtly sexy!) red-carpet moments continue for her.

Black women showed up and showed out in various ways. Black men put their careers and livelihoods on the line to speak out against racial injustice, police violence, and sexual assault and harassment. Creative artists experienced amazing glow ups, and black teenagers all over the country showed that no matter what, still we rise. Let\u2019s take a look at some of the biggest winners of 2017.\n\nBlack Activism\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a year that began with us getting the worst president in the world, black activists continued to do the work to help black people stay alive and get free. That activism took on many forms\u2014from protests both loud and silent to creative arts projects to writing\u2014and it was prolific in the year 2017.\n\nBlack people fought and continued to fight for clean water for the people of Flint, Mich., as well as other cities; social justice; economic justice; and an end to the state-sanctioned murder of black people at the hands of police. These fights are not over, and if 2017 was any indication, our voices will only get louder in 2018.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeyonc\u00e9\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 broke the internet in February when she announced that she was pregnant with twins via an Instagram post, and her year went on an upswing that has not ended. Although we know she has plenty of haters, it\u2019s hard to understand how you can hate on someone so graceful, so beautiful, so talented and so free in her own black womanhood. Her pregnancy led to the birth of beautiful twins\u2014 which she has blessed us with time and time again. Oh, and Sir and Rumi were cute, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer charity and generosity are not always made public, but she gives from the heart when it matters most. Not to mention, her after-pregnancy snapback was real and an inspiration to us all. Deep down inside, she is just a \u201cTexas bama\u201d who has her fangirl moments just like the rest of us, and we are here for it. Long live Queen Bey.\n\nFenty Beauty\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe all have our own favorite makeup brands, but when Rihanna announced that she would be launching Fenty Beauty in September, black girls (and the rest of y\u2019all) went crazy. No, she didn\u2019t make it just for us, but she made it for us in that she kept black girls in mind when creating the color ranges. The products flew off the shelves faster than they could be stocked.\n\nFenty had other beauty lines shook time and time again because Fenty had the range. Just one month in, Fenty had $72 million in earned media value, showing us that the combination of Black Girl Magic and black-girl social media capital is a guaranteed win. Right on, Fenty. Right on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack High School Seniors Accepted to College\n\nDespite being told by America every single day that their lives don\u2019t matter, black students continued to push forward and show that yes, the hell they do. Even as people tried to call them underachievers and say they are destined to a life of nothingness, black kids stood up and loudly proclaimed, \u201cYes, we can!\u201d Whether they were getting accepted to all eight Ivy League schools, heading off to Harvard or fulfilling their dream of going to their favorite HBCU, black high school seniors did the damn thing in 2017, and we are proud of y\u2019all. Keep pushing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCardi B\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe don\u2019t dance no more, she makes money moves. If you look up the phrase \u201cglow up\u201d in the dictionary, right after the definition of the new vertical on The Root, there will be a picture of Cardi B, her tongue hanging out and the look of win on her face, because she seriously glowed up in 2017. Regardless of how you may feel about her, your hate and a Grammy snub won\u2019t stop her shine. She signed big deals, had one of the biggest hits of the year (my current theme song/anthem), got big props from the Queen herself\u2014and despite rumors of a potential breakup, her boo Offset proposed to her with an 8-carat diamond ring. Cardi did 2017 big as hell, and we can only expect that will continue in 2018.\n\nTerry Crews\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt takes a black man who is strong in will and mind to display restraint and not beat the shit out of a perverted white man who gropes his genitals in full view of everyone at a Hollywood party. It takes an even stronger black man to come forward during the #MeToo storm and admit that he, too, was sexually violated by a powerful white man in Hollywood. That strong black man was Terry Crews.\n\nWhile some questioned why he didn\u2019t just pummel Adam Venit when the Hollywood power broker allegedly grabbed his genitals at a party, Crews showed that it\u2019s a game of chess, not checkers, and in the end, the sound mind wins. He filed a police report, filed a lawsuit and spoke out against sexual assault in Hollywood, letting everyone know that he would not be a victim. He was named one of Time magazine\u2019s \u201csilence breakers.\u201d He dropped WME\u2014the agency Venit worked for that basically did nothing to protect Crews and everything to protect Venit\u2014and moved on to new representation, all without being the stereotypical angry black man that everyone wanted or expected him to be.\n\nThat is the very definition of winning. Kudos, Terry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBarack Obama\n\nBarack Obama won 2017 the day he left office as the president of the United States. I am very sure it was like when Scarface quit his job in Half Baked.\n\nOur president started wearing less and going out more. He sent his wife a cute Valentine\u2019s Day tweet. He got crowds and applause just for being a regular-ass dude. People wanted so much more of him, the bidding war over his memoirs reached $60 million. He received the 2017 JFK Profile in Courage Award. He even reported for jury duty in Chicago. He basically showed everyone that leaving the presidency hasn\u2019t stopped his shine or his charisma, and your orange-colored Oompa Loompa of a president could never. Come through, Barack. Come through.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nColin Kaepernick\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNFL ratings are down, and league officials don\u2019t know what to do about it. Good. The NFL deserves whatever \u201cL\u2019s\u201d it gets because the NFL turned its back on Colin Kaepernick. Meanwhile, Kaepernick continues to shine. When he started his silent protests during the national anthem last year, he was widely criticized by people who didn\u2019t understand his need and desire to fight for black lives or the recognition he got for it. None of that matters. Despite it all, Kaepernick is living his best life. He has gotten award after award, and he is even considering buying an NFL team. Take that, NFL. Long live Colin Kaepernick.\n\nBlack Women\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2017 was the year of the black woman.

Henson. Seriously, the woman so regularly kills it on the red carpet, we\u2019re ready to nickname her Buffy the Couture Slayer. At last night\u2019s Academy Awards, she certainly lived up to the moniker, putting her own slightly gothic spin on the goddess-inspired trend that threatened to take over the red carpet.\n\nWearing a sleek bob styled by Tymothe Wallace and a Vera Wang couture gown chosen by stylist Jason Bolden (who also dressed Ava DuVernay this Oscar weekend), the actress showed off her famously toned body with yards of chiffon, sheer paneling and an up-to-there slit, flashing us a gleaming length of leg throughout the evening\u2019s festivities.\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images)\n\nAnd because we never tire of an epic slay here at The Glow Up, when we heard that Henson\u2019s longtime makeup artist Ashunta Sheriff was dishing on the star\u2019s look last night, we naturally wanted the goods. I mean ... who wouldn\u2019t?\n\nFun fact: As both a model and, later, a first-time Grammy nominee, I was blessed to have my face polished to perfection by Ashunta Sheriff. I can personally attest that she is a master of her craft, and a makeup maven who makes contouring a breeze with the first-ever dual-ended foundation stick from her collection, Ashunta Sheriff Beauty. She\u2019s also generous enough to share her expertise: Time spent in her chair is as educational as it is beautifying!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images)\n\nOn that note, here\u2019s our favorite secret to how Sheriff created Henson\u2019s Oscar slay: Several components can be found right in your local drusgtore aisle. For instance, like Issa Rae\u2019s Golden Globes makeup artist, Joanna Simkin, Sheriff looked no further than a reliable household name to make sure Henson\u2019s skin took center stage last night. As she shared with The Glow Up:\n\n1. \u201cBecause Taraji\u2019s dress was Grecian and flowy and showed lots of skin, I wanted to make sure she was glowing and moisturized from head to toe! I used Vaseline Intensive Care Cocoa Radiant Lotion, made with deep healing moisturizers and Vaseline jelly; it was the perfect choice to show off her healthy, luminous skin.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. \u201cTo start off her makeup, I used Fenty Beauty by Rihanna Pro Filt\u2019r Instant Retouch Primer. Then Perfect Blend by Ashunta Sheriff, a dual-ended foundation and concealer that helps you get even in one step. Perfect Blend is the first dual-ended foundation and helps to tone down redness. The formula feels lightweight and wears like a second skin, giving you medium to buildable coverage. I used the shade medium for a natural soft coverage.\n\n\n\n3. \u201cFor Taraji\u2019s already amazing cheekbones, I used my fingertips for a softening effect to highlight, using Danessa Myricks Enlight Illuminator powder in Confidence. Its super-pigmented shimmer is my favorite. I contoured using Cozette S145 Perfect Contour brush and Cozette Infinite Contour Palette to sculpt cheekbones.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. \u201cFor the eyes, I used Kiss Beauty Blowout Lashes in Pixie. These lashes are perfect for sexy and soft looks; plus, Kiss makes affordable lashes that are comparable to high-end brands. I placed lashes close to Taraji\u2019s lash line, then created a thin line using Kiss Waterproof Wonders precision-point eye liner to create definition. I always marry faux lashes and real lashes with Kiss Mascara in Black.\n\n\n\n5. \u201cLastly, I finished the look off with lip liner in MAC Cork and filled in her lips as well, for longevity\u2014layering ensures the color lasts longer. To finish the lip, I applied the Lip Bar Liquid Matte Creme in Savage and Drama Queen.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAshunta Sheriff and Taraji P. Henson are clearly a match made in makeup heaven\u2014after all, what better color to use on Henson than \u201cDrama Queen\u201d? Henson certainly brought the drama last night, and with a slay game this consistent, we\u2019re not sure which we\u2019re more excited about: the Oscar-nominated actress\u2019s next film, or her next appearance on the red carpet!", "keywords": ["henson", "p", "oscars", "perfect", "kiss", "used", "using", "tarajis", "carpetagain", "red", "slays", "glow", "ashunta", "sheriff", "taraji", "lashes", "makeup"], "polarity": 0.1809403559403559, "subjectivity": 0.46866489991489985},

Some butches may look forward to the Super Bowl (I\u2019m personally planning to hate-watch Justin Timberlake\u2019s halftime show), but I look forward to awards season because: red carpets!\n\nListen, I\u2019ve spent most of my life watching hundreds of hours of Project Runway and awards shows, so I consider myself an armchair stylist/designer (that\u2019s a thing, right?). Besides, who can say no to spending hours discussing past Golden Globes dresses, trends and red-carpet-winning looks? Not this stud!\n\n\n\nSince they clearly forgot my ticket to the actual show, tonight I plan to attend The Glow Up\u2019s Facebook party while also hanging out with Black Twitter\u2014 because you can\u2019t outdo black people. So while I wash my \u201cI\u2019m Rooting For Everybody Black\u201d T-shirt and plan my snacks, let\u2019s get into my top five expectations for the Golden Globes red carpet and telecast!\n\n1. Serving Face\n\nThe red carpet is about an all-around look, but the face is just as important as the dress. As the kids say, a beat face does wonders. Plus, part of the face is the look that ladies on the carpet can give reporters who don\u2019t ask actual questions. Yes, I want to know who she\u2019s wearing, but she\u2019s also there for an accomplishment\u2014not who she\u2019s dating. Ask better questions. In any case, a good contour matched with a shady smile will make all the difference in the world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Raise Your Hands for Natural Hair\n\nListen ... I used to live in the house of creamy crack (relaxers, for those who don\u2019t know), but there\u2019s nothing like a good natural braided style or mini \u2019fro or even a blowout that can take my breath away. Remember Janelle Mon\u00e1e\u2019s hair at last year\u2019s Screen Actor Guild Awards? Or Taraji P. Henson\u2019s do on the Black Girls Rock! red carpet? Or my queer sister Lena Waithe\u2019s intricate braided style at the Primetime Emmys? Natural hair on the red carpet reminds young black women that the hair that grows out of our heads is one of the most beautiful and desirable accessories we have in our arsenal of #BlackGirlMagic tricks.\n\n3. Staying on Message\n\nThis Globes is political. Since the public explosion of sexual assault and harassment allegations against Harvey Weinstein and countless others, this will be the first time Hollywood is getting together en masse to celebrate itself. No doubt the mood in the Beverly Hilton might shift from the normal party atmosphere to a more somber evening.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd of course, many are writing about what wearing black on the red carpet will do for the the #TimesUp movement that initiated it and the #MeToo movement founded by Tarana Burke. Will Hollywood stars wearing black really mean something to survivors, or will it come across as self-serving (side-eying you, Rose McGowan)? We also know sexual assault and harassment is not a single-gender issue, so, for folks who do decide to wear black in protest on the red carpet, I hope they\u2019ll be mindful of gendered language when discussing the impact of sexual assault, harassment and violence.\n\n4. More Amy Poehler and Tina Fey\u2014Sorry, Seth Meyers\n\nI\u2019ll be highly surprised if I actually like the monologue. I mean, who can top Amy Poehler and Tina Fey? Probably somebody like Tiffany Haddish. But this year, we\u2019ve got Seth Meyers, which in some ways feels a little off for me. Considering that Hollywood is having its \u201cCome to Jesus\u201d moment, I wonder if maybe this is a bit tone-deaf for the current moment that we\u2019re in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNevertheless, I\u2019m going to miss the \u201cgirl power\u201d of Poehler and Fey, and hope the handling of Hollywood\u2019s emerging scandals will be done with unbridled realness, because that\u2019s what\u2019s needed to break the ice in the room. Let\u2019s get real about what is happening\u2014not just in Hollywood, but in our culture as a whole. Honesty on Meyers\u2019 part might help his fellow dude-bros hear what women, in particular, have been saying for years about the ways in which we are silenced. I\u2019d also really love to see him tell people to straight up stop working with Woody Allen. But I\u2019m pretty sure that won\u2019t happen.\n\n5. Black Excellence\n\nWith this year\u2019s sparse nominations of black actors, I\u2019m hoping to see wins in every category in which a black person is nominated. Yep, I\u2019m rooting for everybody black. The Glow Up\u2019s #ThrowbackThursday: Golden Globes Edition got me hyped for all of that beautiful black excellence that will grace the red carpet! And if you\u2019re a black woman who wins an award, it\u2019s at least guaranteed that Taraji P. Henson will celebrate you, because that\u2019s #Sisterhood (crossing my fingers, because I\u2019d love to see that Issa Rae/Taraji P. Henson moment).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#ThrowbackThursday: Golden Globes Edition No shade to Christmas, but here at The Glow Up, it\u2019s the most wonderful time of year\u2014except Fashion \u2026 Read more Read\n\nAre you ready?

Hyacinthe is one of the hardest-hustling creatives in New York City, crafting a hybrid career out of her two greatest passions: music and fashion. By day, the stylist and CEO of Immaculate Wardrobe dresses Fortune 500 female power brokers; by night, she\u2019s DJ Soda Pop, spinning hip-hop and house at Manhattan venues like the Museum of Sex\u2014where she launches a weekly residency tonight.\n\nThe Glow Up recently caught up with the busy Bronx-born beauty to discuss her parallel creative careers and her future as a fashion DJ. The product of what she describes as a traditional Haitian-American family, Hyacinthe grew up on a steady diet of hip-hop and haute couture, influenced by three older brothers and a style-obsessed stepsister. Her own obsession with fashion began so early, she recalls cutting out and stashing Vogue spreads under her pillowcase, just so she could wear the outfits in her dreams:\n\nI remember being in school\u2014we had to list our skills, what we were good at. And the only thing I [could] think of was that I can put clothes together nicely. ... And I remember picking up\u2014it was Vibe magazine\u2014and they used to have the fashion editorials, and I saw [celebrity fashion stylist] June Ambrose. And they had this article, and I remember it led with \u201cstyle architect,\u201d and I was just like, \u201cThat\u2019s what I want to do!\u201d She was a major inspiration. ... I just saw her, and I was like, \u201cThis is what I aspire to be.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUltimately, it was a mentoring program led by image activist Michaela angela Davis that would be the conduit for bringing Hyacinthe\u2019s aspirations to fruition\u2014and would teach her a powerful lesson in asking for what you want:\n\nIt all starts with Michaela; she was running something called Salon du Shine at her house, where there\u2019d be a group of, like, 10 of us girls [getting] together in her loft in Brooklyn. And we would just talk about stuff, you know. And I remember going up to Michaela, like, \u201cCan you introduce me to June Ambrose?\u201d And she was just like, \u201cI don\u2019t know ... June is super-busy.\u201d I kid you not: A couple of days later, Michaela calls me and she says, \u201cJune is looking for an intern.\u201d... So I went to the interview\u2014June\u2019s two assistants at the time, they tore me to pieces\u2014but I wound up getting the internship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile interning for Ambrose, Hyacinthe also worked full time to put herself through the Fashion Merchandising Management program at New York City\u2019s Berkeley College. It was the beginning of a career path that her Haitian parents, unfortunately, didn\u2019t understand:\n\nMy parents\u2014although they were very loving\u2014they didn\u2019t understand the concept of me wanting to be a stylist and me being in a creative field; it was foreign to them. ... They didn\u2019t have the opportunity to dream as we do, and I think because of that, they\u2019re unable to\u2014they\u2019re in a sense blind to that. ... So I wound up having to put myself through college; I worked full time [in retail] and I did this internship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWorking for Ambrose taught Hyacinthe how the editorials she once obsessed over were created, but it was working in retail that helped her find her niche: helping busy professional women build their wardrobes.\n\nI would work with clients, and they\u2019d be like, \u201cSophia, I love working with you; you style me so well. I wish you could come dress me at home.\u201d And one day I actually got the courage to say, \u201cWell, I can.\u201d ... So this one client took me up on it, and I went to her house and started with her closet. But then she had me speak with her career coach, and that\u2019s when it really clicked: This is on another level. Like, you know, female executives really need this. And I really found the value that I could add.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIdentifying her core clientele and their unique need to possess a high-end wardrobe without having the time to curate or shop for it, Hyacinthe launched her company, Immaculate Wardrobe. The self-described \u201cwardrobe whisperer\u201d currently dresses about 20 clients, all of whom are powerful women who inspire her daily, as she explained:\n\n\n\nI work primarily with female boss bitches. These are women that are working [as] CEOs of companies, and they\u2019re also moms. ... I feel like it\u2019s really important for me to surround myself with these powerful women. And I feel like since they\u2019re at the top of their companies, not only am I empowering them, but also the women that come [into their companies] that\u2019ve just graduated from college ... to see that someone at the top of their career is not only killing it, but also killing it with style.\n\nBut while helping other women fulfill their potential, Hyacinthe also realized an opportunity to further fulfill her own. A longtime avid lover of music, she was often critical of DJs on the New York City nightclub scene. Challenged by an exasperated friend to learn for herself, she accepted his gift of a DJ class at New York\u2019s famed Rock & Soul record store. Instantly, another passion was born, along with an alter ego: DJ Soda Pop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike her styling career, Hyacinthe\u2019s growth as a DJ has been simultaneously organic and self-driven. She initially asked more-established DJs for opening slots and cultivated her own contacts and connections. It\u2019s a path that called into conflict the hip-hop-loving girl from New York\u2019s Bronx borough and the cultured style expert whom elite businesswomen entrust with their wardrobes:\n\n\n\nGrowing up in my family, I grew up listening to Reasonable Doubt, to Onyx, to Nas\u2014like, really hard music. Like, I\u2019m very feminine and girly now, but I grew up liking really hard-core rap. I\u2019ve always known that I\u2019ve had this love and passion for music, but it was, \u201cOK, Sophia, either you can pursue fashion styling or you can be a DJ.\u201d I didn\u2019t think in my mind\u2014I couldn\u2019t fathom the idea of me flourishing in both fields ... [But] to be honest with you, I can\u2019t exist with one without the other. ... I feel like they feed into each other so much, especially the route that I want to go. ... I want to be New York\u2019s new fashion DJ, and there\u2019s not enough of us brown girls up there that are actually doing it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile her dual careers may seem to be a study in contrasts, Hyacinthe approaches both spinning and styling instinctively, using unexpected textural combinations to evoke new feelings. And in the process of embracing her dual passions, her own identity fell into place.\n\nI feel like deejaying has really helped me fully come into my skin. ... Even with race: It\u2019s like before, I thought that I needed to kind of neglect my own identity to be accepted. And I know I\u2019m not the only one that feels that way; as a black woman in the fashion industry, which is predominantly white. I thought that I needed to strip some of my identity\u2014the fact that I listened to hip-hop, the fact that I loved it, the fact that I came from the Bronx\u2014I thought that I almost needed to move away from that in order for me to be seen in society as being this elegant person in fashion ... [but] I feel like once you accept yourself, they have no choice but to accept you for who you are. And I feel like deejaying has really allowed me to accept myself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up tip: If you\u2019re in the New York City area, you can catch DJ Soda Pop every Thursday night at the Museum of Sex at 233 Fifth Ave. She launches her weekly residency Thursday night with a viewing party for RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race.", "keywords": ["feel", "york", "inside", "dj", "women", "think", "fashion", "really", "wardrobe", "hyacinthe", "career", "dope", "night", "double", "sophia", "dressed", "life"], "polarity": 0.16347579051383396, "subjectivity": 0.5693305335968378},

I mean, we know she\u2019s an Oakland, Calif., native, and a child model-turned-Disney starlet. We know she appeared on Dancing With the Stars before scoring the coveted role of M.J. in the latest installment of the Spider-Man franchise. We even know she\u2019s also a singer whose 2014 single \u201cReplay\u201d hit No. 40 on the Billboard charts, and most recently she sang while swinging on a flying trapeze in Hugh Jackman\u2019s latest film, the Oscar-nominated The Greatest Showman.\n\nBut we can\u2019t really pinpoint the moment when she arrived\u2014on our radar, at least. It feels as if we just looked up one day and there she was, stunning and perfectly deserving of the spotlight. All we know is that we\u2019ve had a hard time taking our eyes off of her ever since, because she consistently gets it right on the red carpet.\n\nThe 90th annual Academy Awards ceremony was no exception. The Glow Up Facebook live thread collectively gasped when Zendaya appeared on the step-and-repeat in a one-sleeved, deep-sienna-colored chiffon gown by Giambattista Valli. (Notably, the gown beautifully photographed chocolate brown against the red carpet, then appeared a burnished burgundy against the Oscars stage set, where she was a presenter.) On another star, the voluminous silhouette might have been overwhelming, but at a willowy 5 feet 10 inches, the 21-year-old looked like a true goddess, even as an ingenue among established megastars.\n\nBut everyone knows it takes a village to raise a successful red-carpet look, and Zendaya has found a dream team in stylist Law Roach (who also styled Mary J. Blige for the evening), makeup artist Sheika Daley and hairstylist Ursula Stephen, the mastermind who created many of Rihanna\u2019s most iconic looks.\n\nTo offset the volume of her dress, Stephen chose to keep her starlet\u2019s hair stylish and simple, telling The Glow Up, \u201cZendaya and I went back and forth about her look for tonight\u2019s show, but ultimately landed on a sleek and chic top knot to enhance the elegant silhouette created by her Giambattista Valli dress.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images)\n\nBut pulled-back doesn\u2019t automatically mean easy, especially when you\u2019re creating a style that has to last from the awards ceremony through the after-party. So Stephen\u2014a brand ambassador for Unilever as well as Dyson hair products\u2014gave The Glow Up her step-by-step on how to create the perfect topknot\u2014using her go-to tools and products. With most of these products available in our local drugstore, frankly, this is a high-low tutorial we can wrap our heads around. Says Stephen:\n\n\n\n\u201cI prepped Zendaya\u2019s damp hair by spritzing Dove Style + Care Smooth & Shine Heat Protection Spray [$5.99] throughout before blow-drying as straight as possible with my Dyson Supersonic hair dryer [$399.99], which was on high heat and speed.\n\n\u201cOnce the hair was dry\u2014and super shiny!\u2014I sprayed with Suave Professionals Natural Hold Compressed Micro Mist Hairspray [$3.94] and separated her hair in half from ear to ear and brushed the top section into a high ponytail, securing it with an elastic.\n\n\u201cNext, I brought the bottom section up and secured the two pieces together before twisting them up into a chic little knot, which I secured with hair pins. [Pro tip: Separating the hair into sections allows for more control over the look and ensures security through the night.]\n\n\u201cI finished the look with TRESemm\u00e9 Compressed Micro-Mist Hair Spray Hold Level 2: Smooth [$4.99] to keep strands sleek and in place all night, without the stiffness and crunch of a traditional hair spray.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Christopher Polk (Getty Images)\n\nOf course, pulling the star\u2019s hair off her face perfectly showcased a glowing face and gorgeous sienna smoky eye by makeup artist Sheika Daley. [Editor\u2019s note: The Glow Up reached out to Daley for the specific tricks and tools she used Oscar night, but as of press time, we haven\u2019t received the details.] To re-create the look, we\u2019d suggest using eye shadow colors from the Masquerade palette by Juvia\u2019s Place ($25 for a mini palette), or the Obsessions palette in Warm Brown from Huda Beauty ($27). To quickly create a sultry, smoky eye similar to Zendaya\u2019s:\n\nApply an eye shadow base or primer, to lock in color. We like Black Up\u2019s new Matte Eye Primer ($23). Apply liquid liner to the upper lash line, avoiding an obvious cat eye. Define the outer corners of each crease with a dark matte brown eye shadow shade. Using a deep mahogany shade, smoke the eye from lash to just above the crease, extending slightly at the outer ends.\n\nUse a fine brush to lightly smudge the same color on the lower lash line. Pop the inner corners of the eyes with a shimmering champagne shadow. Apply several layers of mascara\u2014making sure to avoid clumps!\n\nNeedless to say, we loved this look, not only for its drama but also for its timeless simplicity. The 90th annual Academy Awards were so filled with nostalgia that Rita Moreno even wore the dress she wore when she accepted her 1962 Oscar (and still fit in beautifully!) for West Side Story. But looking at Zendaya\u2019s gorgeous goddess-inspired glamour last night, it\u2019s hard to think that her polished, graceful beauty will ever go out of style.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images)\n\nEditor\u2019s note: A previous version of this post erroneously referred to the character of M.J. as the romantic interest in Spider-Man: Homecoming.", "keywords": ["simply", "glamour", "stunning", "getty", "hair", "oscars", "zendaya", "know", "eye", "look", "palette", "glow", "shadow", "night", "served"], "polarity": 0.21726044554696233, "subjectivity": 0.5395757737892568},

Celebrities of all stripes are dashing down to their favorite dermatologists or plastic surgeons for cosmetic procedures as if they were popping down to the local deli to pick up a bag of chips. But while a little \u201ctweaking\u201d might be a high priority for models, actresses and entertainers when prepping their faces and bodies for display at the most-photographed events on the planet, it\u2019s equally important for them to do it safely.\n\nFor those of you who are curious about trying a little something-something for yourselves, here\u2019s a little advice from a girl\u2014me\u2014who\u2019s been there and back (and back again) ...\n\nGive Yourself Time\n\nNever rush into or out of any cosmetic procedure, no matter how minor or major. Two months before your planned event, a good first step is a cosmetic peel, like a micro laser or glycolic acid peel, to get your glow up before the cameras flash. You can repeat both of these procedures once a month in the two months leading up to a big event.\n\nA light glycolic acid peel takes less than five minutes and is the safest route to go for exfoliating and boosting the glow of your skin with no downtime. Medical-grade glycolic acid peels contain 30 percent active ingredients, are noninvasive, five-minute procedures done by a nurse in the doctor\u2019s office and cost around $100.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor heavy lines or discoloration, a micro laser peel is more effective. Laser resurfacing requiring numbing cream, involves some pain and leaves the face scored with a fine veil of microscopic scabs that resemble a tan from about a foot away. You\u2019ll need three days of downtime, and the procedure will cost you between $400 and $1,600\u2014but results last about a year.\n\nTwo Months Before\n\nDid you catch Chrissy Teigen\u2019s viral YouTube post about the life-changing power of eyelash extensions? It\u2019s a truth I can attest to, as well. I swear by them for the same reasons she does: You wake up looking instantly made up, and with a two-month head start, you can skip the falsies and use a growth serum.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRevitalash requires no prescription\u2014just $98 for a three-month supply. Prescription Latisse grows lashes overnight like mushrooms but can cause darkening and discoloration of the eyelid\u2014which happened when I used it\u2014and the cost, not including the visit to the doc, runs about $120. With either one, you\u2019ll begin to see results in about eight weeks. If used faithfully, 16 weeks later, you\u2019ll see the full lengthening and thickening effect.\n\nOne Month Before\n\nThirty days is the average amount of time it takes for Botox and fillers like Juvederm, Restylane, Voluma or Belotero to settle in and give that \u201csecond nature look.\u201d Fillers work right away but take at least two weeks for any swelling or bruising to totally subside. Botox is faster-acting and eases the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles in approximately a week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn your initial consult for injectables, ask your physician if an appointment for a touch-up is included in the fee along with the initial service. Injectables, which should be done only under a doctor\u2019s supervision, vary in price, depending on the area of the country where you get the service. They range from $200 to $600 for Botox and $600 to $1,200 for fillers per area.\n\nIt\u2019s important to take your time and be conservative when using medications that temporarily alter both the movement and the appearance of your face. There\u2019s no place to hide if it goes wrong. Too much filler, and you can look like a monster with baked potatoes trapped under your skin. Too much Botox can make you look like the caretakers in the movie Get Out\u2014expressionless, despite how you\u2019re feeling inside. If, say, your eyebrows end up arched as high as RuPaul\u2019s reading some tragic drag queen, it\u2019s possible for your physician to tweak the way your Botox looks afterward\u2014but it can\u2019t be undone. In short, you\u2019ll have to live with it for three to four months until it fades away.\n\nAccording to the American Board of Cosmetic Surgery website, fillers can also be reduced at the site through manual manipulation of the area from massage, or with a round of antidotal injections. My doctor estimates that more than 50 percent of stars, both men and women, rely on injections to perfect their red-carpet look, and that likely 100 percent get some sort of treatment to their face ahead of time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo as we settle in for the fun of star-gazing during awards season, coveting those red-carpet jewels and gowns and wondering just how our favorite star got that glow, here\u2019s some down-to-earth advice: Sleep, eat right and exercise whenever you can. When you\u2019re investing your time and money\u2014not to mention your hopes into looking great for a big event\u2014take it slow if you want to win.", "keywords": ["facetune", "botox", "fillers", "know", "little", "months", "youll", "cosmetic", "peel", "look", "redcarpet", "regular", "procedures", "weeks"], "polarity": 0.10158753063514966, "subjectivity": 0.45806941295036524},

Films that are laughably absurd, either on purpose or by accident, but still manage to entertain.\n\nFeature films and documentaries have been made about those films, but an overlooked segment of delightful terribleness is music videos. They, too, can be so bad they are great, so absurd they become accidentally profound. (Note that I am commenting on the videos, not the songs.)\n\n\n\nIn my ongoing attempt to highlight the underappreciated parts of black culture, I present to you the 10 best worst black videos of all time, ranked.\n\n\n\n10. \u201cSomebody\u2019s Watching Me,\u201d by Rockwell\n\nRockwell\u2019s video does its best to give the feel of a 1980s horror film with the continuous first-person shot and the cuts to macabre faces and images \u00e0 la Brian De Palma. It might have worked if he had tried to act; instead, he just relies on the fact that he is light-skinned with curly hair. Two observations: 1) I still can\u2019t believe they got Michael Jackson to sing the chorus, and 2) someone should have told him his boxers were showing in the shower.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. \u201cWe Don\u2019t Have to Take Our Clothes Off,\u201d by Jermaine Stewart\n\nThis is a song about how lovers don\u2019t have to take their clothes off while a woman in the foreground consistently takes her clothes off as she is splashed with water, accosted by wind that makes her dress fly up, and wears a graduation mortarboard and tassel. The late, great singer is exuberant and full of life in the video, but the campiness of the direction is too much to overcome.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. \u201cYou Are Not Alone,\u201d by Michael Jackson\n\nThe King of Pop was a music-video auteur. \u201cThriller,\u201d \u201cBad,\u201d \u201cBeat It\u201d: They are classics. This video featuring Lisa Marie Presley is one of his few missteps because in it, he tries desperately to be sexy and fails miserably. Related: How long are we going to delay having a conversation about Michael\u2019s kids? Old Mike may have been light bright, but young Mike\u2019s genes are still of the brown-skin, dark, curly-hair variety. Too soon? Never mind.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. \u201cTwisted,\u201d by Keith Sweat\n\nUsher\u2019s \u201cNice and Slow\u201d is a VERY close second on the \u201990s absurd-R&B-action video rankings, but Mr. Raymond is earnest in his illogical storyline, while Keith Sweat does little more than his sexy detective face. The robbery/murder is poorly planned and executed, and Sweat has one reaction to everything that happens: bored, sleepy and high. Song is fire, though.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. \u201cKeep on Loving Me,\u201d by the Whispers\n\nA ubiquitous GIF comes from your misogynistic uncle\u2019s favorite video. I\u2019ll leave the hair, mustaches and suits alone because they are a product of their time (I bet you can find an Easter Sunday picture of your grandfather or father wearing those exact-same threads). Yet I am confused by this video. The five men following a woman thing is creepy; what would they have done if they caught her? And, finally, where the hell are they going?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[Editor\u2019s note: The views of Law Ware do not necessarily reflect the views of VSB or, at least Panama Jackson, who thinks this video\u2014and song, for that matter\u2014is one of the best he\u2019s ever seen in his entire life and hopes to re-create it at some point and will be the one wearing the red sports jacket. \u2014P.J.]\n\n\n\n5. \u201cWord Up,\u201d by Cameo\n\nCameo must have been trying to make a bad video. Everything from the police opening to the band-member intros to the fact that he stands in front of a New York City bridge while wearing a leather jacket, a body suit and a red jockstrap cup screams intentionality. I have always wondered if that was, in fact, LeVar Burton dancing at the beginning of the video. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not, but a man can dream.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. \u201cMust Be the Money,\u201d by Deion Sanders\n\nThis begins with a flashback of him wearing a fake Jheri-curl wig as he rhymes the words nine and dotted line. Then it transitions into a four-minute montage of Primetime looking into the mirror admiring himself as women fawn over him. We could call this the first reality show.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. \u201cPut Your Mouth on Me,\u201d by Eddie Murphy\n\nI cannot overstate how big Eddie Murphy was in the \u201980s. After 48 Hours, Beverly Hills Cop and Raw, he was so powerful that dude released a trash song and it went to No. 2 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. The song that was the inspiration for this video, however, was off the second, less successful album, So Happy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, the song is about what you think, and Murphy spends the entire song either lying on a couch looking like a knockoff Prince Hakim or standing on a stage giving googly eyes to the camera, channeling Prince. This is a poor man\u2019s Michael Jackson video.\n\n2. \u201cThe Rain,\u201d by Oran Juice Jones\n\nThis is most known for the words \u201cYou gotta get on outta here with that\n\nalley-cat-coat-wearin\u2019 hush-puppy-shoe-wearin\u2019 crumb cake I saw you with \u2026 ,\u201d but the video is just as absurd as those lyrics. In fact, this could be a toxic-black-masculinity tutorial. He stalks her and uses money to assert power, all while wearing flawless makeup and never standing in the rain despite singing about precipitation and wearing a raincoat. This would be No. 1 if not for the red gloves in \u2026\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. \u201cDon\u2019t Look Any Further,\u201d by Dennis Edwards\n\nThe red-gloved hands that seem to be disembodied, the backdrop, the gum he chews throughout, the wink, the faces he makes. This is the best worst video in every possible way. The song bumps, but the video is so bad in so many amazing ways that it deserves to be on repeat at the National Museum of African American History and Culture. I wonder if the great Timothy Anne Burnside can hook that up.

You will adore Love & Hip Hop: Miami.\n\nThanks to the lovely folks who work in publicity over at VH1, I was hashtag-blessed to be provided with a screener for the premiere episode of the new franchise of Love & Hip Hop, set in Miami. While I\u2019m sad that my trigger-happy hometown of Houston had the filming for its spinoff shut down, I\u2019m relieved at how good the Miami season looks to be shaping up. There are people I have actually heard of (Trina, Trick Daddy, Gunplay, Veronica Vega, Pleasure P), and when it comes to those I have never heard of in my natural black-ass life, I\u2019m not bothered\u2014yet, anyway. Now, there is someone I wish had stayed on Flavor Flav\u2019s old show and let us be, but I\u2019ll let y\u2019all decide whether or not she makes for a necessary addition to the show.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLove & Hip Hip: Miami, starring Trina, Da Baddest Bitch, premieres New Year\u2019s Day on VH1.\n\n\n\n2. The Chi will not only be Showtime\u2019s latest hit but will also be its blackest one in a smooth while.\n\nThe Emmy-winning writer and actress Lena Waithe was kind enough to pass along a screener to her new series, which is executive-produced by both her and Common, and while I don\u2019t want to spoil anything (yes, even for those who have since seen it on YouTube courtesy of Showtime), I will say it\u2019s interesting how a fictitious show about the city of Chicago and its residents feels more real than many of the stories reported from national media. That has a lot to do with those at the helm of The Chi, and while we shouldn\u2019t need the reminder at this point, nevertheless, this show reminds us how important it is to allow black people the opportunity to tell our own stories.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Chi premieres Jan. 7 on Showtime.\n\n\n\n3. Omarosa will probably get a book deal, but no one will give a damn.\n\nOmarosa Manigault Newman is trying to creep her ass back into the community after opportunistically latching herself onto the white-nationalist-themed campaign and administration of that bigoted, narcissistic jerk-off. Given that she has name recognition, worked for his administration and is relentless in her quest for airtime, she won\u2019t exactly go away. Even so, we don\u2019t fuck with her anymore, and regardless of whatever story she claims she has to tell, most of us couldn\u2019t give a decimeter of a damn. Shoo, sis. Shoo.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Sweet Potato Saddam will try to fire Robert Mueller.\n\nRepublicans won\u2019t do a thing about it, but getting rid of the special prosecutor doesn\u2019t mean that 45 and his minions won\u2019t face any repercussions for his purported actions. Someone should tell that buffoon that you don\u2019t constantly come for the entire FBI and get away with it. Beyond that, there\u2019s a New York attorney general who still aims to make time for 45 and his band of dingbats. Not to mention, it will be leak city. I\u2019m already laughing because there\u2019s only so much one\u2014even the wannabe despotic president\u2014can get away with.\n\n\n\n5. People will continue to use shade wrong.\n\nI am so sick of people using shade wrong, which is exactly why the LGBTQ ... SWV community should have placed our slang in a safe-deposit box years ago. Not everything is shade. Sometimes it\u2019s a read, which is not the same as shade, and while I could explain the difference for the umpteenth time, I refuse because I don\u2019t want to help y\u2019all. Having said that, I miss \u201cShade Court,\u201d but shoutout to Kara Brown for getting those TV writing checks.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. Halle Berry will be back in love.\n\nRecently the Oscar-winning actress took to her Instagram Live to post a picture of a heart made of ribbon with a split down the middle captioned with, \u201cDone with love.\u201d Berry recently broke it off with producer Alex da Kid, but, with all due respect, many of us never understood how that happened to begin with. Nevertheless, while I doubt that she will heed my unsolicited career advice and star in a Boomerang-esque romantic comedy on television themed around being a veteran bae still looking for love, I do anticipate her shaking off the simp in that post and be back to another boo by Groundhog Day.\n\n\n\n7. The Democrats will win the House of Representatives.\n\nNew York Times columnist Bret Stephens fancies himself a conservative intellectual, but considering that that wing of the American political system is run by a village idiot who requires that his intelligence briefings be dumbed down with bullet points and avoid any emotional triggering (re: Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election), that\u2019s rather meaningless. This is especially true of Stephens, who notoriously doesn\u2019t believe in climate change. Beloved, if you can\u2019t even master what Captain Planet taught the world by cartoon, your political analysis is literary manure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis includes a recent column in which he warns that the Democrats are walking into a \u201cTrumpian trap.\u201d What does that mean? Nothing; it means nothing. No one likes Sweet Potato Saddam, and the GOP is run by two factions: crazy, evil billionaires and the poorer morons who think like them but don\u2019t enjoy the same tax bracket. So while the Donkey Party does often behave like asses, that asshole in the White House is making it all too easy for former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi to get her gavel back. The only thing propping up the GOP right now is racial gerrymandering, and that\u2019s really the only thing that could prevent the devastating electoral fade awaiting them.\n\nP.S.: Black people will save the day, but most of the pundits on cable news will whitewash the shit and pretend that it was suburban white people who did it, despite all obvious evidence to the contrary.\n\n\n\n8. The secretary of state will be pushed out.\n\nAt the earliest, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who I still say looks exactly like Blanche Devereaux\u2019s old boyfriend, who was also named Rex, will be out by Martin Luther King Jr. Day at the earliest or St. Patrick\u2019s Day at the latest. Either way, they\u2019re going to boot him out. Most will not care because he is the worst secretary of state ever. But don\u2019t worry about him; he\u2019s old, white and rich. If anything, let\u2019s hope he talks reckless the second he\u2019s told to get the hell out of the State Department already.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. Charles Barkley will continue giving political commentary, and I will curse you all for allowing it.\n\nCharles Barkley made a little bit of sense when speaking about the special election to fill the Senate seat of that racist sum\u2019bitch Jeff Sessions, and true to form, many in the media have gone overboard and encouraged this man to keep talking.\n\nBut as I explained earlier in this year while reviewing his TNT show on race:\n\nCharles Barkley is like that black uncle you find amusing but limit conversations with at family gatherings to select topics such as sports, Gap Band songs and brown liquor. When it comes to more serious matters like politics and, specifically, racial politics, the phrase \u201cStop, drop and roll\u201d is an immediate survival guide to sparing your last nerve from a fatal end. If, however, you find yourself cornered, you grit your teeth and try to remain respectful of your elder before you end up screaming, \u201cNigga, what the hell are you saying?\u201d in an effort not to upset your mother.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet, here we are again. To be fair, though, a round of applause for him pledging $1 million to help black women launch information technology startups in Alabama.\n\n10. Beyonc\u00e9 will finally give me the B\u2019Day sequel we all deserve.\n\nThis is more like a public plea than prediction, but I live in Trump\u2019s America, so I need an uptempo project from King Bey. Like, I love the thoughtful explorations of race and gender and I encourage more of that\u2014but not on the next album. Or, at the very least, mix it up. As in, I need more thot bops, Beyonc\u00e9. Please.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n11. Nicki Minaj will learn to edit.\n\nI am #TeamMinaj and have been since I found her on WorldStarHipHop.

I\u2019m eagerly anticipating her new album, but I feel like she\u2019s finally going to learn that less is more. The Pinkprint was honestly a very strong body of work if you pretend about eight songs (the pop ones and the ones where she sings) don\u2019t exist. That Cash Money model of putting 90,071 tracks on a single project has stumbled Minaj\u2019s discography in some cases. But-but-but, I think she\u2019s figured it out now.\n\n\n\n12. Cardi B will continue searching for her name on Twitter and responding to folks she thinks are haters.\n\nEven when they don\u2019t directly @ her, and that makes me sad.\n\n13. Issa will learn to duck on the new season of Insecure.\n\nOr, if nothing else, she\u2019ll have a towel ready and take it like a champ next time. Also: Straight people will be clogging my feeds all summer long debating this show.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n14. Future fans will continue acting like Russell Wilson being a good stepfather is an affront to them.\n\nDespite being a casual bystander in #FutureHive, I will never understand the shit.

I love Jesus, too; still, the holiday season overlaps with cuffing season, and with all that cold weather and love in the air, you are likely to spend your time either drinking eggnog while laid up with the one you love or sipping something dark and flavorful contemplating why you\u2019re alone on Christmas Eve. Musical artists know this\u2014that is why there is an embarrassment of riches when it comes to brown-liquor Christmas songs.\n\nAs I stated before, in order for a track to qualify as a \u201cbrown liquor\u201d song, it must meet certain criteria:\n\nIt must have a pronounced bass line.\n\nThis bass line must be contrasted with an ethereal harmony.\n\nThe sonic tension between these juxtapositions must evoke a mood that is either libidinous or mournful in nature.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet for it to qualify as a brown-liquor Christmas song, it must do Nos. 1 to 3 while also commenting upon or utilizing symbols of the holiday season. This can be done by a) turning a traditional Christmas song into a brown-liquor song (see: the Temptations\u2019 \u201cSilent Night\u201d); b) taking a symbol of Christmas and using it in playful and libidinous ways (see: Clarence Carter\u2019s \u201cBack Door Santa\u201d); or c) using Christmas as a setting to lament the one who got away (see: Luther\u2019s \u201cEvery Year, Every Christmas\u201d).\n\nMany Christmas songs qualify, but below, I present to you the 10 best brown-liquor Christmas songs of all time, ranked.\n\n\n\n10. \u201cMerry Christmas Baby,\u201d by Kenny Burrell\n\nThis is a soulful and jazzy cover of the Johnny Moore\u2019s Three Blazers classic. It\u2019s perfect background music for when you have friends over and you\u2019re mixing up amaretto sours.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. \u201cMy Favorite Things,\u201d by John Coltrane\n\nI\u2019m a jazz snob. I don\u2019t do the cheap, elevator-music-adjacent Kenny G bastardization of the black-American art form. If it doesn\u2019t push the boundaries of melody, then you can miss me with your whitewashed, sweet-white-wine shenanigans. \u201cMy Favorite Things\u201d by \u2019Trane is a 13-minute encounter with the divine. It is a masterpiece and perfect with a hot buttered bourbon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. \u201cSanta Claus Wants Some Loving,\u201d by Albert King\n\nEven Santa has needs. This raunchy jawn is your crazy uncle\u2019s second-favorite Christmas song. He drinks Jim Beam out the bottle while he listens to it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. \u201cEvery Year, Every Christmas,\u201d by Luther Vandross\n\nLuther\u2019s voice was one of a kind. \u201cIntimate,\u201d \u201csultry\u201d and \u201cvelvety\u201d don\u2019t do it justice, and his voice is on full display as he sings about how the holiday is a source of pain because his lover is not with him. Sip this with Crown Royal and ginger ale. Be sure you don\u2019t get tears in the glass.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. \u201cA Child Is Born,\u201d by Oscar Peterson\n\nThis is a quiet, mournful jazz standard written by composer Alec Wilder and trumpeter Thad Jones. On this cover, Peterson improvises on the melody, filling out the sonic landscape of the song in ways that make it both soulful and melancholic. Watch the snowfall as you listen to this and drink a Swedish glogg.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. \u201cPlease Come Home for Christmas,\u201d by Charles Brown\n\nThis is the official Christmas song of juke joints and liquor houses everywhere. Charles Brown\u2019s vocalizations put one in the mood to sip something brown and aged while yearning for the one who got away. Pair this with a Macallan 18-year, straight, no chaser.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. \u201cSilent Night,\u201d by the Temptations\n\nThe Temptations\u2019 rendition of this Christmas classic is a soulful blend of the sacred and the secular. Listening to Glenn Leonard makes me do the ugly church face ubiquitous in black houses of worship. This is your spiked-apple-cider song.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. \u201cLet It Snow,\u201d by Boyz II Men\n\nChristmas is in winter, and winter is cuffing season. I contend that \u201cLet It Snow\u201d is the definitive sexy Christmas song. \u201cThe market is full of widely recognized artists singing the usual classics,\u201d says Elon Dancy, professor of education and associate dean for community engagement and academic inclusion at the University of Oklahoma. He is a scholar world-renowned for his research into black men in higher education but is also an underappreciated cultural critic. He continues, \u201cHowever, one of the special contributions of Christmas Interpretations is that the majority of the album is original Christmas music \u2026 it is musical velvet.\u201d Keep warm as this plays by sipping a spiked hot chocolate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. \u201cBack Door Santa,\u201d by Clarence Carter\n\nOn this track, Carter is petty, trifling and brilliant. That\u2019s why this is your crazy uncle\u2019s favorite Christmas song.

She fixed her teeth, made Billboard chart history, and finessed her way into the ears and hearts of pop culture and into the arms of Offset\u2014one-third of Migos, the hit squad behind club banger \u201cBad and Boujee\u201d\u2014all without actually being bougie herself.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe didn\u2019t achieve any of this without merit: Cardi B was on her grind as an exotic dancer, established herself on social media and parlayed Insta-fame into a Love & Hip Hop feature, which became the springboard for her current success. Her most recent achievement? Being included among a gaggle of seasoned artists nominated for the 2018 Grammy Awards\u2014in not just one category but two.\n\nAnd notably, she did all of this by being herself\u2014all while being \u201chood.\u201d\n\nHailing from Highbridge, a neighborhood in New York City\u2019s South Bronx, Cardi B is the personification of LL Cool J\u2019s 1980s hit \u201cAround the Way Girl.\u201d Her baby hairs are perpetually pumping, and her lip gloss stays popping. Her snarl game is infectious, compliments of a new, blinged-out grill. She is full of street wit and unafraid to spit whatever truth needs to be heard, at any given time\u2014but so did the Lisas, Angelas, Pamelas and Renees from Any Hood, USA.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese women immortalized bamboo earrings. They wore extensions in their hair way back when black girls were ostracized for wearing weaves and braids, before \u201cprotective styles\u201d were trending, before buying bundles was a thing.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m talking about the \u201cregular, degular, shmegular\u201d girls from around the way, holding down 9-to-5s and side hustles; juggling school, raising kids and going hard in their ascension to be their best selves. They are a special brand of go-getter who often outperform those around them. They get it done while wearing colossal Havana twists that fall to their waistlines, thick glamour lashes copped from the beauty-supply store and/or blinged-out stiletto acrylic nails.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome pop gum while speaking a language peppered with neck-rolling colloquialisms and four-letter words that convey the type of wisdom one can only gain coming from where they come from. Cardi B is of the same ilk, and although she has upgraded herself materially and physically\u2014in the ways that money and fame allow\u2014we adore her. The girl next door? Not so much. The two are unequally celebrated.\n\nCollectively, we cape for Cardi B. We want to see our favorite underdog win because she is the antithesis of political correctness. And yet we revel in jokes and memes that mock all aspects of the \u201chood chick.\u201d Many are dragged on social media for being body positive, for loving the skin they are in. They\u2019re objectified and policed by trolls and the online respectability police. Meanwhile, Cardi B gets over 7 million views for proudly showing off her cosmetically enhanced tits and ass, and her notoriously long tongue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeldom do we read tales of charming rappers asking for the around-the-way girl\u2019s hand in marriage. Hip-hop is often obsessed with shitting on them and referring to them as \u201cthots,\u201d while Cardi B is offered 3-carat-diamond validation.\n\nAnd the film and television industry is equally complicit as it remains culpable in the erasure and portrayal of our beloved homegirls through exaggerated characters such as Martin\u2019s Sheneneh Jenkins (insultingly played in drag). Like the Sambos of the Jim Crow era, around-the-way girls have long been stereotyped and caricatured. Their image is for consumption and degradation.\n\nBottom line: We, as a people, need to check our respectability politics and selective classism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is clear that Cardi B reigns supreme in the same spaces where others like her are dismissed. Instead of side-eyeing our sisters in the hood\u2014for being extra, for doing \u201cthe most\u201d\u2014perhaps we could salute them for their relentless negritude; for establishing a culture within a society that prefers conformity; for the courage to be themselves. In the age of continued anti-black and anti-woman rhetoric\u2014let alone in the age of misogynoir\u2014these are acts of real resistance.\n\n\n\nSo when we gather in front of our televisions on Jan. 28 for the 60th annual Grammy Awards and root for everybody black\u2014including Cardi B\u2014be mindful to applaud and pay homage to the girls from around your way, too.

And I\u2019m here to help with that. I\u2019m like Santa\u2019s Little Helper, perhaps the oldest dog of all time. My life is one big-ass non sequitur.\n\nThere are days when it\u2019s just too much. What is \u201cit\u201d? It. Shit, I don\u2019t know, man. Everything. Nothing. But whatever it is puts you in a space where you just feel particularly black.

The piece basically makes the case that it\u2019s the song that changed Jay\u2019s career, and I agree. Also, the song itself is one of his most innovative and dope records. It would be one thing if, I don\u2019t know, \u201cLucky Me\u201d were listed as numero uno. \u201cHard Knock Life\u201d changed everything for Jay and sent him on the road to that billi he\u2019s headed toward.

Holy Grail and Blueprint 2, plus the R. Kelly albums, toward the end. Look, it doesn\u2019t really matter what song came in No. 176 (\u201cOh My God\u201d) or even No. 254 (\u201cStranded [Haiti Mon Amour]\u201d). Ranking those songs was a labor of love, I assure you, and only because he began the undertaking did Kennedy even have to listen to them.\n\nNope, the only songs that really mattered are Nos. 1, 2-10 and the very last fucking song, 274.

On this list, \u201cHollywood\u201d in all its putrescence is ranked at No. 263. I think we call that \u201cmercy\u201d in the religious community.\n\nHow bad is \u201cHollywood\u201d? It\u2019s so bad, I couldn\u2019t find a YouTube video of the song. It\u2019s so bad that when I pulled it up on Tidal, I immediately got mad that I pay $9.99 a month to listen to this song. This song is so bad that even Beyonc\u00e9 couldn\u2019t save it. Even Jay\u2019s flow on the song is basura. This song is bad on an album full of bad songs. Even now, I went back and listened to \u201cAnything\u201d and almost decided that \u201cAnything\u201d IS the worst, but nope, I have visceral reactions to \u201cHollywood,\u201d mostly because why, Jay, did you make this song? Bey is the only good thing about this super-contrived-ass song.\n\nIt\u2019s as if Jay said, \u201cI need a song that sounds like a good radio song; somebody queue some trash up,\u201d and Young Guru said, \u201cSay no more.\u201d Maybe I\u2019m being harsh, but to me, it\u2019s that bad. You know, I\u2019m surprised nobody has pointed out that all of their best collaborations happened on Beyonc\u00e9 albums. \u201cUpgrade You,\u201d \u201cDrunk in Love,\u201d \u201cCrazy in Love,\u201d etc. Meanwhile, Jay has \u201cHollywood,\u201d \u201cBonnie and Clyde \u201903\u201d and \u201cLift Off,\u201d though the latter was on the Watch the Throne album. Point is, Bey kept the best collabos for herself. She smart.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo you know how sometimes people say things like, \u201cEven though it\u2019s the worst, that doesn\u2019t make something bad\u201d? Yeah, that doesn\u2019t apply here. \u201cAnything\u201d is legit a terrible song. When your favorite artists are prolific and have a tremendous output, not everything is going to be good, but bad is bad, man. Shit. And \u201cAnything\u201d is amazingly bad.\n\nI don\u2019t know if anybody has ever asked Jay about that song (probably not), but I know I\u2019ve often wondered what goes on in the head of these artists when they hear certain songs and decide, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s it right there.\u201d Granted, perhaps there are other factors at work and there\u2019s a sound he was going for. I\u2019ve often felt that way about \u201cJustify My Thug\u201d on The Black Album.\n\nThe Black Album is easily one of Jay\u2019s best albums. On my personal list, it\u2019s No. 3 after Reasonable Doubt and The Blueprint and, now, right before 4:44. But \u201cJustify My Thug\u201d always felt like an anomaly to me. The beat, produced by one of my all-time favorites, DJ Quik, felt like a throwaway. Even the song itself seemed ... ungood. It made No. 218 on the Vulture list.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, the good thing about an artist of Jay\u2019s caliber is that the good faaaaaar outweighs the bad. And there\u2019s so much good. The good is full of so many highs and cultural landmarks that, short of Jay releasing an album full of records that all sound like \u201cHollywood\u201d or \u201cAnything\u201d or \u201cSuper Ugly\u201d (which, to its credit, had the SUPER dope \u201cBad Intentions\u201d beat from Dr. Dre and Knoc-Turn\u2019Al), he\u2019ll be all right.\n\nPlus, when you\u2019ve been around for a solid 20-plus years, constantly putting in work, the bottom of that list tends to be forgotten out of respect. And ultimately, Jay probably laughs about such things as he walks into the bank and they roll out the red carpet and pour him glasses of D\u2019Uss\u00e9 while he says, \u201cAm I still rich?\u201d and the bankers say, \u201cYes, Jay, sir, you are still rich.\u201d\n\nBut just know that if anybody you know ever tells you that a) Kingdom Come is their favorite Jay album and b) \u201cAnything\u201d (or \u201cHollywood\u201d) is their favorite song, they are not to be trusted.", "keywords": ["songs", "kingdom", "bad", "jays", "jayzs", "hollywood", "know", "song", "album", "worst", "good", "come", "jay", "really"], "polarity": 0.05103646353646356, "subjectivity": 0.5874589673147363},

I love Rachel Maddow, but even with her fancy degree from Stanford University in public policy, Maddow has never explained why \u201cthe United Nation never mind their fucking business\u201d like Cardi B. And Maddow is a Rhodes scholar! Cardi B, on the other hand, eschewed an academic curriculum because she planned for a career as \u201ca boss, not a worker.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be fair, Maddow is one of the few reporters to talk about the African slave trade in Libya. But unlike Cardi B, Maddow failed to tie it in with Muammar Qaddafi, or, as Cardi describes him, \u201cthe nigga that was running Libya.\u201d\n\nCardi B bravely acknowledges that she might be killed for explaining how it\u2019s convenient for the other U.N. countries to disregard a humanitarian crisis so they can take advantage of Libya\u2019s resources. She eloquently characterizes the situation as \u201ca lotta fuck shit going on.\u201d\n\nBut who would do the weather report?\n\nCardi B, of course.\n\nCardi B would skip all the nonsense about cold fronts and barometric pressure to give the most necessary information.

The first song on the album is called \u201cApple of My Eye.\u201d As I listened to this song for the first time, a very familiar voice, one I\u2019ve been listening to since I was 9 years old (I\u2019m currently 38), came booming through the system: that of Raphael Saadiq.\n\nThe man who told me in 1990 that it never rained in Southern California (absolutely not true\u2014it does rain, just not enough) and had me ready to \u201cdance tonight\u201d (every night) in 2000 is still showing up on albums in 2017 by one of the more famous rappers in the game. Still sounding crisp as ever; making music worth listening to.\n\n\n\nIt was at that moment I realized a simple fact: Raphael Saadiq might be the most underappreciated artist in music, but especially R&B. Ever.\n\nEver.\n\nI hear you looking at me; I\u2019m not crazy. Think about it. For real for real. Why do I say the most underappreciated? Simple. When was the last time you had a conversation about great artists and Raphael Saadiq\u2019s name came up? I\u2019ll wait. This despite the fact that he\u2019s not only been around for what feels like my entire life, but has been making music that I\u2019ve listened to during that entire span. Even his Wikipedia page is disrespectful; Ja Rule\u2019s page is more in-depth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTony! Toni! Ton\u00e9! dropped in 1988. Nobody really remembers that first album much, but in 1990, when the group came through with the second album, The Revival, we were all paying attention. \u201cFeels Good\u201d still jams, and if you tell me that you love the \u201990s and don\u2019t know the words to \u201cIt Never Rains (in Southern California),\u201d I will call you a lie and a cheat, Joe Jackson, and I don\u2019t want you.\n\nThe group brought us such classics as \u201cAnniversary,\u201d \u201cLay Your Head (on My Pillow),\u201d \u201cNo Loot,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s Get Down,\u201d \u201cThinkin\u2019 of You\u201d and \u201cJust Me and You,\u201d and you know that, especially given later successes, Raphael was at least driving 75 percent of the time on that road trip. House of Music? It\u2019s like butter, baby, and hinted, substantially, at where he\u2019d be going, especially with his solo works and D\u2019Angelo. Put a pin in D\u2019Angelo.\n\nDuring this time comes the real solo hammer: 1995\u2019s \u201cAsk of You\u201d from the Higher Learning soundtrack. Bruh. I ain\u2019t saying it\u2019s the most \u201990s song of all time\u2014or the best\u2014but this song made its way onto almost every \u201cYou My Boo\u201d mixtape back when those were actually cassette tapes. It is that dope a song. Not to mention, his harmonica game was on a hundred-thousand trillion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe years 1999 and 2000 were huge for Raphael and the culture. Along with Ali Shaheed Muhammad from A Tribe Called Quest and Dawn Robinson from En Vogue, Saadiq brought us Lucy Pearl, a group project that included the song \u201cDance Tonight\u201d but was, on its own merits, an album chock-full of dope jams and smooth riddims. I still rock this album\u2014front to back\u2014today. That was \u201999. In 2000 he helped D\u2019Angelo channel his vision for the song \u201cUntitled (How Does It Feel)\u201c from the Voodoo album, which led to \u201cthe video.\u201d Don\u2019t forget, though, Saadiq was a significant part of D\u2019Angelo\u2019s song \u201cLady\u201d from Brown Sugar.\n\nThus far, we\u2019ve got the three Tony/i/es, Lucy Pearl, D\u2019Angelo and solo recordings, all yielding magnificent results.\n\nBut 2002 is when the rubber hit the road, fam. He released his debut album (a solid 14 years after really hitting the scene) with the ABSOLUTE, INARGUABLY classic album Instant Vintage. From \u201cDoing What I Can\u201d to \u201cSkyy, Can You Feel Me,\u201d the entire album was one big-ass ride though musical perfection. If you have never heard this album, you absolutely should head to your nearest streaming service and listen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou\u2019re welcome.\n\nLet\u2019s skip a little bit, seeing as how Saadiq\u2019s catalog includes production for a plethora of artists from Angie Stone to Erykah Badu to Bobby Valentino. But take a gander\u2014a goose, if you will\u2014to 2016, when Solange Knowles drops an album that had unicorns and gangstas alike looking for cranes in the sky, the relevantly titled A Seat at the Table. Saadiq was instrumental in helping Solange see through her vision to craft an album that was heralded and lauded by critics from all corners of the musical kingdom.\n\nEven after all of those musical contributions, Saadiq has garnered very few Grammy nods or wins (just one, I believe), and rarely is his name included in conversations about music\u2019s most important or significant figures. Largely, I think it\u2019s due to his vocal range, which isn\u2019t exemplary, though I am a big fan of his voice and vocal performances on recordings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe\u2019s a singer whose strength as a songwriter outshines his vocal abilities, even if he has one of the most distinctive voices in R&B ever. I can\u2019t think of any other reason why somebody who has worked with the range of artists he\u2019s worked with, who\u2019s created the body of work he\u2019s created and been able to successfully create music of different stylings across decades and eras, who has songs that are vital to the listening experience of a particularly strong decade of R&B, and who is responsible for some of the most compelling music of several artists\u2019 careers doesn\u2019t even have an episode of Unsung and might be, textbook, the most unsung black artist ever, considering his contributions.\n\nSaadiq deserves a seat at the table of R&B greats, and hopefully, he gets his due one day.\n\n", "keywords": ["think", "artists", "saadiq", "song", "solo", "yeah", "raphael", "artist", "music", "rb", "album", "vocal", "underappreciated"], "polarity": 0.17916984773982056, "subjectivity": 0.4882617322291236},

My great uncle Jehosophat Rallo Jenkins Berkshire Jr. II once told me that he\u2019d heard (while working the chitlin circuit in celebration of his debut record, \u201cButt Cheeks Ain\u2019t Nothin\u2019 but a Good Time Masquerading as Child Support Payments,\u201d which, believe it or not, never charted) that before Robert Johnson allegedly sold his soul to the devil in exchange for musical greatness and success, he tried to sell his soul to a waitress in Biloxi because of dat ass.\n\nAs a card-carrying member of the Gluteus Maximi for the World Society\u2014a club built on humanity and core values of booty appreciation\u2014we annually discuss the intersection of kinetics, slow motion and music, and how to best shake that ass for peace, love and soul. It is in this endeavor that we rank booty shake jams. I\u2019m going to let you all in on our annual rankings\u2014for this year only\u2014to see where we landed on some jams whose sole purpose is putting asses in motion on the dance floor.\n\n[As a point of historical note, in December of last year, VSB\u2019s Damon Young pondered what the second-best booty song of all time was and listed a bunch of contenders but never ranked them. In a true sign of how important all of the songs listed are, this ranking was compiled BEFORE I even remembered the booty piece existed. Most of the songs he included made this list. That means these songs are hard science now.]\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. \u201cBaby Got Back\u201d by Sir Mix-a-Lot\n\nOut of respect for the first to really put asses on the map, this song enters the rankings. Sure, you will never actually hear this at a club where black people congregate, and it\u2019s more likely to be in a set that includes Vanilla Ice and Blink-182, but before the song was co-opted (and ensured Mix a tremendous payday), it was the song that displayed the true appreciation for asses\u2014plus, it\u2019s probably the only video that features a rapper dancing atop a fake ass that would make Jim Henson proud.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. \u201cPop That\u201d by French Montana, Drake, Rick Ross, Lil Wayne\n\nThis song is so hype you can\u2019t help but getting to gyratin\u2019. Plus it contains a sample of one of the greatest booty songs of all time, which means that of course it would end up as one of the best. Plus it includes, for me, one of Drake\u2019s funnest verses ever.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. \u201cNo Hands\u201d by Waka Flocka Flame, Roscoe Dash, Wale\n\nAll that ass, in them jeans. Probably also features Wale\u2019s most memorable verse ever. With that slow-plodding beat and hook, strippers everywhere showed us how it was done, and dance floor savants were happy to point out, \u201clook ma, no hands.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. \u201cBandz A Make Her Dance\u201d by Juicy J, 2 Chainz, Lil Wayne\n\nNo lie, the most explicit non-stripper dance I\u2019ve ever seen in my life happened to this song at a club in D.C. This woman had an actual audience of men and women watching, didn\u2019t care and proceeded to earn the respect and admiration of all who bore witness. I promise I\u2019m not making this up; people shook her hand after she stopped. Respect due.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. \u201cShake Ya Ass\u201d by Mystikal\n\nIf you don\u2019t watch yourself and show people what you\u2019re working with while listening to this song, then you\u2019re doing it wrong.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. \u201cRump Shaker\u201d by Wreckx-n-Effect\n\nKids nowadays have no idea about the wonderousness that was \u201cRump Shaker,\u201d featuring a video that was taboo for its time (though today there are church congregations featuring less clothes than the participants of said video), but \u201cRump Shaker\u201d was everything, and everything was \u201cRump Shaker.\u201d To the rump. Yes, all I do wanna do is zooma zoom zoom zoom. It\u2019s really the only way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. \u201cI Wanna Rock (Doo Doo Brown)\u201d by Luke\n\nDon\u2019t stop, pop that *CENSORED*, let me see you Doo Doo Brown. Those words (the whole lyric sheet really) should be handed into the National Archives for permanent commemoration next to the Declaration of Independence for their unapologetic desire to move butts. I know it\u2019s not couth to call an ass jam perfect, but the BPM is way up, the call and response is explicitly ideal for anybody 18+ and the cardio workout potential is unparalleled.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. \u201cGet Low\u201d by Lil Jon & the East Side Boyz, Ying Yang Twins\n\nWhen it\u2019s all said and done, Lil Jon will be heralded as a prime purveyor of the pop. His whole catalog is perfectly suited for putting that ass on the floor. \u201cGet Low\u201d is a crown jewel of booty usage, especially because of the Ying Yang Twins, in that it\u2019s instructional, educational, great for exercise and ultimately is about teaching the youth the difference between windows and walls, filling a tremendous gap in public education.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. \u201cDa Butt\u201d by E.U.\n\nOne of only two songs guaranteed to ensure a rush of emotions and asses to the floor. Do you have to have a big ol\u2019 butt in order to do da butt? No, you do not. You just have to be willing to shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake and able to do \u201cda butt\u201d until it makes you sore. Yeah.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. \u201cBack That Azz Up\u201d by Juvenile\n\nTo quote Damon, from way back yonder: \u201cBut the best booty song ever, undoubtedly and undisputedly, is \u2018Back That Azz Up.\u2019 There\u2019s no question, no debate, no argument, no discussion. If I titled this \u2018What\u2019s The Best Booty Song Of All-Time\u2019 instead, it would be resolved in five words. \u2018Back That Azz Up\u2019 and \u2018Duh.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom the \u201999 to infinity ... and beyond.", "keywords": ["songs", "butt", "rump", "lil", "floor", "song", "ranked", "best", "shaker", "booty", "shake", "ass"], "polarity": 0.21381578947368415, "subjectivity": 0.49908625730994144},

From her breakout role in the film Girls Trip to landing her own comedy special on Netflix, Haddish has become quite the household name. Recently she had the opportunity to be the first black comedienne to host Saturday Night Live in the show\u2019s 42-year run. While much of the response to her hosting was positive, several people on social media noted that they had issues with Haddish and her overall persona.\n\n\n\nSome have referred to Haddish as being crass, loud and overtly vulgar. Others have commented that she is not a great representation of black women and that much of what she has said and done is overtly problematic.\n\nHearing this, and knowing that there are so many other marginalized female celebrities who have created brands around what I\u2019ve heard referred to as \u201chood feminism,\u201d I suggest that those who celebrate Cardi B and judge Tiffany Haddish do so only because of anti-blackness and respectability politics.\n\n\n\nHear me out.\n\n\n\nFor those of you who might be asking, \u201cHow can my love for Cardi B and my disdain for Tiffany Haddish make me anti-black?\u201d I would challenge you to think about what you have been taught regarding black women.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn this society, black women are forever held to a higher standard. Black women are forever reminded that these standards always mean making others comfortable because as black women they should always be positive representations of the entire black community.\n\nEven in moments when black women don\u2019t opt to be representatives of the black community, there is always an unwritten expectation that they should be vying to be the next Michelle Obama.\n\n\n\nYes, positive representation of black women is essential in a time when the entire black community is under attack, but we have to truly ask why it seems that we celebrate one woman\u2019s success and demean another\u2019s.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the intent of this article is not to throw Cardi B under the bus and shade her for all that she has done for the Afro-Latinx community, the challenge in this article is to investigate why it seems that black women, specifically black comediennes, always catch more heat for the things they do and say while other nonblack female entertainers are celebrated as the blueprint.\n\n\n\nWe have to acknowledge that the game of respectability politics is more at play when we\u2019re discussing why we dance to Cardi B singing about not having to strip anymore to make a living, but shame Haddish for screaming that she made it out the hood.\n\nIn moments like these, when we police what black women say and do, we are ultimately doing exactly what the system of oppression wants us to do. Anti-blackness and respectability politics benefit the oppressor in moments like these because we are, in fact, upholding standards of whiteness and what whiteness expects black women to be in mainstream media.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe greater challenge is asking ourselves why black women must always make us comfortable, even in moments when they are speaking from a place of truth. Black women don\u2019t owe anyone anything and should always be celebrated when they are able to break through the glass ceiling.\n\n\n\nThe struggle will always be real, and we should forever celebrate any woman who is able to capitalize off of said struggle.\n\nRemember, not everything or everyone is for us, and just because Haddish doesn\u2019t make you laugh doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not funny.\n\n", "keywords": ["antiblackness", "women", "tiffany", "moments", "haddish", "b", "cardi", "forever", "positive", "respectability", "real", "black", "comedy"], "polarity": 0.05731268731268731, "subjectivity": 0.46281218781218797},

And we can\u2019t breathe one word about that evening\u2019s red carpet without acknowledging our current and forever #Fave, Yara Shahidi. Like, we may have to come up with a concept stronger than #Goals to explain how we feel about her.\n\n\n\nWhen the 17-year-old shining star stepped on that SAG Awards red carpet, we collectively gasped\u2014and haven\u2019t taken a breath since. She snatched every one of our wigs that night, from her full, flowing mane and face glossed by Chanel all the way to the trailing train of her custom Ralph Lauren jumpsuit. And we can\u2019t forget to mention the exaggerated back bow detail that added the perfect touch of whimsy to an otherwise sophisticated silhouette. Every single thing was right about that look.\n\nPersonally, I just had to know the details of her beyond-glam makeup and to-the-heavens hair. After a little cyber searching, I came across the two boss babes responsible for Yara\u2019s carpet-crushing hair and makeup. After doing some gushing about the magic they created, I was able to tease out step-by-step instructions on how to re-create the textured tresses and flawless makeup from the red carpet\u2014product details and all!\n\n\n\nHairstylist to the stars Nai\u2019vasha Johnson is the real deal, having magnified the manes of many of our celebrity faves, including Zendaya, Uzo Aduba, songbirds (and Yara\u2019s Grown-ish co-stars) Chloe x Halle, Dear White People\u2019s Logan Browning and Chewing Gum\u2019s Michaela Coel. Represented by Exclusive Artists Management, this celebrity hairstylist is a master, whether working with wigs and extensions, braided works of art or textured tresses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith all of this talent, Johnson is more than just a hair expert. She has often spoken up in support of female-focused platforms, as well as addressing some of the pressures put on black women to alter their hair for cultural approval. For this mother of two daughters\u2014one who has decided to keep her hair natural and another with a relaxer\u2014the priority is on healthy hair and a woman\u2019s right to choose and not feel pressured to conform. Her focus is healthy hair, in whatever form that means for any woman she is working with.\n\nTo achieve Yara\u2019s showstopping look last Sunday, Johnson used products from natural-hair-care maven Taliah Waajid. Johnson says: \u201cThe inspiration was glamorous Diana Ross. I wanted her beautiful texture delicately brushed out.\u201d\n\nJohnson graciously gave us a detailed step-by-step on how she created Yara\u2019s blown-out brown bombshell style for the SAG Awards:\n\nSaturate damp hair from root to tip with the Taliah Waajid Green Apple and Aloe Nutrition Leave-In Conditioner. Brush hair thoroughly with a boar-bristle brush to evenly distribute the product. Dry hair with a diffuser. Add a quarter size of Taliah Waajid Curly Curl Cream to define curls and add shine. Brush out hair with a boar-bristle brush to Diana Ross-esque perfection!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow on to Yara\u2019s flawlessly painted face, courtesy of celebrity makeup artist Emily Cheng. Her makeup masterpieces have been seen on red carpets and editorial pages for years. She is also responsible for many of Yara\u2019s fresh looks that we\u2019ve been swooning over recently.\n\nUsing all Chanel Beauty products, Cheng chose the matchless mix of deep-wine lips and high shine on the lids to complement the chic strapless, tuxedo-inspired gown-turned-jumpsuit made exclusively for Yara.\n\nHere is Cheng\u2019s full beauty breakdown of the Chanel products she used to achieve Yara\u2019s glossy glow:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrep Products\n\nEye Essentials\n\nCritical for Cheeks\n\nLip List\n\nSo there you have it: We can all now be one step closer to Yara Shahidi shine ... which was definitely at the top of my 2018 resolutions.

Blige. Riding high on a wave of supporting actress nominations for Mudbound\u2014including two Golden Globe nods and one from the Screen Actors Guild (with the Oscar nominations still pending)\u2014the songstress and actress also celebrated her birthday Jan. 11 at the Critic\u2019s Choice Awards. And she was every bit the bombshell birthday girl, looking snatched for the gawds in a glimmering golden gown.\n\nThat morning, she kicked off her personal new year by unveiling her brand-spanking-new star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, an honor well-deserved by the woman whose accolades include nine Grammy Awards (and 31 nominations) and 10 Billboard Music Awards.\n\nOf course, Blige is no stranger to high style or red carpets\u2014though we\u2019d be lying if we said that her recent glow up doesn\u2019t feel extra special. But what we\u2019re really loving about Blige\u2019s #BestWeekEver is that it reminds us about the beauty awaiting us in every breakdown\u2014in her case, the ongoing dissolution of her marriage. It\u2019s always a wonderful thing to see your heroes win; but for a star who\u2019s remained as relatable as Blige, it\u2019s also inspiring to see her continue to channel her worst moments into her best performances, as she shared with Variety magazine:\n\n\n\nI used a lot of my own heaviness from my own misery that I was living in that horrible marriage ... I was just dying in it. I knew something was wrong. I just couldn\u2019t prove it. I just had all the heaviness of not feeling right, not feeling good. I gave it to [the character of] Florence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the experience of stripping down to play a sharecropper\u2019s wife during the Great Depression also proved to be affirming for the megastar, helping her tap into the true beauty of being just Mary, without the trappings of being megastar Mary J. Blige.\n\nWe couldn\u2019t wear makeup. We couldn\u2019t have nails. We couldn\u2019t do eyelashes. I was stripped down to the bare necessities of Mary. And that really helped me because people were saying things like, \u2018Gosh \u2014 you\u2019re so beautiful.\u2019 It helped my self-esteem.\n\nAnd it shows. Frankly, we\u2019ve never seen Blige more beautiful than she has been lately. This Glow Up Goddess is showing us that the lotus truly does grow in the mud\u2014or, in her case, in her gorgeous performance in Mudbound. She may not be entirely free of the mess with her soon-to-be-ex, but we\u2019re thrilled to see she\u2019s well on her way to being happy.", "keywords": ["looking", "love", "shes", "looks", "blige", "megastar", "marriage", "fine", "couldnt", "j", "nominations", "star", "life", "best", "living", "really", "mary"], "polarity": 0.29032774170274156, "subjectivity": 0.5998616522366522},

And while this year\u2019s look could very well have been a wig (where can we get one?), it was so good, we neither know nor care, because it was pure glory.\n\nRegardless of what look she chooses, Ms. Davis is always smart, kind and important to us.

Though most of last night\u2019s dresses fell firmly on the side of \u201cmeh,\u201d one of our #Faves, Issa Rae, was a clear standout.\n\n\n\nWearing a plunging and shimmering black gown by Prabal Gurung\u2014which we would\u2019ve loved on her in almost any color\u2014Rae stood in solidarity with her comrades in the #TimesUp movement, who prompted the evening\u2019s theme of #AllBlackEverything. As the Insecure star, who was nominated for best actress in a TV comedy or musical series, told E! News, \u201cTime is up, and I\u2019m happy to make an impact. Bye, old Hollywood! You\u2019re dead.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut in a sea of black dresses, how does a rising star make a splash? For Rae\u2019s longtime makeup artist Joanna Simkin, the answer was ultimately simple: Let her gorgeous skin take the spotlight.\n\n\u201cI [was] honestly a little nervous, because I think that color is so beautiful on her,\u201d Simkin told The Glow Up. \u201cIt took me a minute to figure out, \u2018What am I going to do? How do I make her stick out?\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe answer came to her in collaboration with Rae\u2019s stylist, Jason Rembert.\n\n\u201cI told him: \u2018Honestly, I think it\u2019s about her skin, because her skin is stunning,\u2019\u201d Simkin said. \u201cAnd he was like, \u2018I agree!\u2019\u201d It\u2019s really about her skin, and her smile.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter begging Rembert to give her arms, collarbone and cleavage to work with this year, Simkin began experimenting with ways to make Rae\u2019s skin really gleam. She found an emollient\u2014and affordable\u2014solution in Vaseline Cocoa Radiant Smoothing Body Butter.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m kind of obsessed with it. It\u2019s very hydrating\u2014like, super hydrating,\u201d she said. \u201cI was mixing pigments into it, to get the hydration with shimmer, too ... her skin reflecting is really all I\u2019m going for.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd if you\u2019re shocked to find out that one of your faves has found a new favorite in the drugstore aisle, the key is in how hydrating Vaseline\u2019s formula is, aside from its delicious scent.\n\n\n\n\u201c[Issa]\u2019s a big fan of anything that\u2019s really hydrating, and she really likes it,\u201d Simkin said. \u201cI like the finish on it\u2014when we put it on, I felt like her skin was gleaming, without looking like I had oiled her. I\u2019m very cognizant about how her skin photographs; especially against a black dress.\u201d\n\nThe pigment Simkin used is, surprisingly, also a drugstore brand. Despite the many high-end pigments she has in her arsenal, her favorite for Rae\u2019s skin came courtesy of CoverGirl\u2019s Katy Kat Pearl Shadow + Highlighter, which she scraped into the body butter to give a glistening effect on the skin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimkin topped off her own CoverGirl\u2019s look\u2014Rae is a brand ambassador\u2014with a soft plum-based smoky eye, which you can achieve at home using CoverGirl\u2019s TruNaked Roses Shadow Palette (Mauvergine, Rose Gold and Mousse) and CoverGirl TruNaked Smoky Shadow Palette (Jet). Each is less than $10, so that\u2019s a whole lotta red-carpet-ready look at a bargain price!\n\nWe may not end up looking as flawlessly fly as Rae\u2014who personified #BlackGirlMagic last night\u2014but for less than $30, we\u2019re sure gonna try!", "keywords": ["love", "golden", "simkin", "im", "skin", "hydrating", "covergirls", "globes", "favorite", "raes", "look", "issa", "drugstore", "glow", "told", "shadow", "black", "really"], "polarity": 0.2421085858585858, "subjectivity": 0.5480045160600716},

But as it\u2019s gained steam in the collective consciousness, we genuinely hope the red-carpet blackout is a significant show of strength for the over-300-strong all-female coalition seemingly ready to put their money and power where their mouths are, in part by creating legal defense funds and lobbying for stronger protections and parity for women far less privileged than they are.\n\nWhile wearing black may seem like a small gesture in addressing the systemic sexual abuse and inequality that continue to plague women outside of Hollywood, supporting the gesture seems like the least we can do to support a movement that appears to have all of our best interests at heart.

Some butches may look forward to the Super Bowl (I\u2019m personally planning to hate-watch Justin Timberlake\u2019s halftime show), but I look forward to awards season because: red carpets!\n\nListen, I\u2019ve spent most of my life watching hundreds of hours of Project Runway and awards shows, so I consider myself an armchair stylist/designer (that\u2019s a thing, right?). Besides, who can say no to spending hours discussing past Golden Globes dresses, trends and red-carpet-winning looks? Not this stud!\n\n\n\nSince they clearly forgot my ticket to the actual show, tonight I plan to attend The Glow Up\u2019s Facebook party while also hanging out with Black Twitter\u2014 because you can\u2019t outdo black people. So while I wash my \u201cI\u2019m Rooting For Everybody Black\u201d T-shirt and plan my snacks, let\u2019s get into my top five expectations for the Golden Globes red carpet and telecast!\n\n1. Serving Face\n\nThe red carpet is about an all-around look, but the face is just as important as the dress. As the kids say, a beat face does wonders. Plus, part of the face is the look that ladies on the carpet can give reporters who don\u2019t ask actual questions. Yes, I want to know who she\u2019s wearing, but she\u2019s also there for an accomplishment\u2014not who she\u2019s dating. Ask better questions. In any case, a good contour matched with a shady smile will make all the difference in the world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Raise Your Hands for Natural Hair\n\nListen ... I used to live in the house of creamy crack (relaxers, for those who don\u2019t know), but there\u2019s nothing like a good natural braided style or mini \u2019fro or even a blowout that can take my breath away. Remember Janelle Mon\u00e1e\u2019s hair at last year\u2019s Screen Actor Guild Awards? Or Taraji P. Henson\u2019s do on the Black Girls Rock! red carpet? Or my queer sister Lena Waithe\u2019s intricate braided style at the Primetime Emmys? Natural hair on the red carpet reminds young black women that the hair that grows out of our heads is one of the most beautiful and desirable accessories we have in our arsenal of #BlackGirlMagic tricks.\n\n3. Staying on Message\n\nThis Globes is political. Since the public explosion of sexual assault and harassment allegations against Harvey Weinstein and countless others, this will be the first time Hollywood is getting together en masse to celebrate itself. No doubt the mood in the Beverly Hilton might shift from the normal party atmosphere to a more somber evening.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd of course, many are writing about what wearing black on the red carpet will do for the the #TimesUp movement that initiated it and the #MeToo movement founded by Tarana Burke. Will Hollywood stars wearing black really mean something to survivors, or will it come across as self-serving (side-eying you, Rose McGowan)? We also know sexual assault and harassment is not a single-gender issue, so, for folks who do decide to wear black in protest on the red carpet, I hope they\u2019ll be mindful of gendered language when discussing the impact of sexual assault, harassment and violence.\n\n4. More Amy Poehler and Tina Fey\u2014Sorry, Seth Meyers\n\nI\u2019ll be highly surprised if I actually like the monologue. I mean, who can top Amy Poehler and Tina Fey? Probably somebody like Tiffany Haddish. But this year, we\u2019ve got Seth Meyers, which in some ways feels a little off for me. Considering that Hollywood is having its \u201cCome to Jesus\u201d moment, I wonder if maybe this is a bit tone-deaf for the current moment that we\u2019re in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNevertheless, I\u2019m going to miss the \u201cgirl power\u201d of Poehler and Fey, and hope the handling of Hollywood\u2019s emerging scandals will be done with unbridled realness, because that\u2019s what\u2019s needed to break the ice in the room. Let\u2019s get real about what is happening\u2014not just in Hollywood, but in our culture as a whole. Honesty on Meyers\u2019 part might help his fellow dude-bros hear what women, in particular, have been saying for years about the ways in which we are silenced. I\u2019d also really love to see him tell people to straight up stop working with Woody Allen. But I\u2019m pretty sure that won\u2019t happen.\n\n5. Black Excellence\n\nWith this year\u2019s sparse nominations of black actors, I\u2019m hoping to see wins in every category in which a black person is nominated. Yep, I\u2019m rooting for everybody black. The Glow Up\u2019s #ThrowbackThursday: Golden Globes Edition got me hyped for all of that beautiful black excellence that will grace the red carpet! And if you\u2019re a black woman who wins an award, it\u2019s at least guaranteed that Taraji P. Henson will celebrate you, because that\u2019s #Sisterhood (crossing my fingers, because I\u2019d love to see that Issa Rae/Taraji P. Henson moment).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#ThrowbackThursday: Golden Globes Edition No shade to Christmas, but here at The Glow Up, it\u2019s the most wonderful time of year\u2014except Fashion \u2026 Read more Read\n\nAre you ready?
