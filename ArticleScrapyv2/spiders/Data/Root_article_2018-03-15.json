Many are familiar with Tarana Burke, who started the #MeToo movement a decade ago, but far less people know that key legislation barring sexual harassment in the workplace came as a direct result of lawsuits black women filed.\n\n\u201cThe problem, and what [many feminists today] are not saying,\u201d Steinem told the crowd, \u201cis that women of color in general\u2014and especially black women\u2014have always been more likely to be feminist than white women.\u201d\n\nIf it is an astonishing statement, particularly coming from a white woman, it is also a true one.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack women and women of color have actively fought for the rights and livelihoods of women for more than two centuries, yet their stories and contributions are often sidelined in the mainstream narrative of the feminist movement.\n\nThey did so at a greater risk of violence, and they did so even as white suffragettes actively rallied against civil rights for black Americans, as Anna Howard Shaw, president of the National American Woman Suffrage Association, did when she argued that black women \u201chave put the ballot in the hands of your black men, thus making them political superiors of white women.\n\n\u201cNever before in the history of the world have men made former slaves the political masters of their former mistresses!\u201d Shaw added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd when white feminists weren\u2019t actively undermining the efforts of feminists of color, their absence and silence around issues women of color faced was conspicuous. For instance, as white feminists fought for reproductive rights, they largely overlooked the complicated relationship women of color, who had historically been subjected to sterilization programs without their knowledge or consent, had to the movement.\n\nAs more Americans embrace intersectional feminism and its emphasis on inclusion, it\u2019s important to remember that intersectional feminism has alway been practiced by black women and women of color, who combatted the gender violence of their day as well as confronted racial abuse and exploitation of their labor. Below, we\u2019ve laid out a few of those women\u2014some whose names may be familiar and some whose names aren\u2019t.\n\nAs we see below, the fight for workers\u2019 rights has always been a fight for women\u2019s rights, particularly for women of color, and the erasure of labor as part of the feminist movement says more about the work and the women this country has historically valued than it does about their contributions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe following women\u2019s efforts fighting management abuses and racial and sexual abuse in the workplace have bettered the lives of an uncountable number of women, and their organizing tactics laid the groundwork for battles that continue to this day. For that reason, the women of the labor movement are featured prominently on this list.\n\n\n\nThis list is by no means a complete list. It is, we hope, a helpful starting point for getting reacquainted with the centuries of labor that women of color have put into making this country a fairer, more equitable place for everyone.\n\n\n\nSojourner Truth (1797-1883)\n\nBorn into slavery, Sojourner Truth was among the first to articulate the divide between black womanhood and white womanhood in America.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn her 1851 \u201cAin\u2019t I a Woman\u201d speech, which remains one of the most famous women\u2019s rights speeches ever delivered, Truth asked the Akron, Ohio, audience:\n\nThat man over there says that women need to be helped into carriages, and lifted over ditches, and to have the best place everywhere. Nobody ever helps me into carriages, or over mud puddles, or gives me any best place! But ain\u2019t a woman? Look at me. Look at my arm. I have ploughed and planted, and gathered into barns, and no man could head me! And ain\u2019t I a woman?\n\nShe is the sole black woman to have a literal seat at the table at artist Judy Chicago\u2019s iconic \u201cDinner Party\u201d installation, which features some of the most prominent women in history.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMississippi\u2019s First Labor Union (1866)\n\nIn June 1866, a group of newly freed black women working as laundresses in Jackson, Miss., formed the state\u2019s first labor union, the Washerwomen of Jackson. Together, the women sent a resolution to then-Mayor D.N. Barrows that demanded a \u201cuniform rate for our labor.\u201d The bold action inspired other freedmen to write their own resolutions petitioning for fair wages, all in a climate where white planters and politicians were trying to re-enslave them through notorious \u201cBlack Codes\u201d legislation.\n\nLucy Parsons (1853-1942)\n\nParsons, born Lucy Eldine Gonzalez, is believed to have been born into bondage, though much of her early life is undocumented. Many believe she was of black, Mexican and Native American origin, though she only ever acknowledged her Mexican and indigenous heritage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nParsons, along with her husband Albert, were trailblazing figures among American anarchists and in the radical labor movement. A staunch anti-capitalist, Parsons\u2019 feminism was grounded in class issues. She helped organize the 1915 Chicago Hunger Strike of Chicago, in which demonstrators marched on behalf of unemployed and hungry men, women and children.\n\nAnna Julia Cooper (1858-1964)\n\nCooper was one of the pre-eminent scholars of her day, earning a bachelor\u2019s and a master\u2019s degree from Oberlin College despite having been born a slave in North Carolina just before the Civil War.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Black Liberation activist, Cooper spoke and wrote frequently about black womanhood. Her 1892 book, A Voice From the South by a Black Woman of the South, is a classic black feminist text, and her 1893 speech, \u201cWomen\u2019s Cause Is One and Universal,\u201d delivered in front of a mostly white audience at the World\u2019s Congress of Representative Women in Chicago, illuminated the stark differences between white women and black women:\n\nThe white woman could least plead for her own emancipation; the black woman, doubly enslaved, could but suffer and struggle and be silent. I speak for the colored women of the South, because it is there that the millions of blacks in this country have watered the soil with blood and tears, and it is there too that the colored woman of America has made her characteristic history, and there her destiny evolving. Let woman\u2019s claim be as broad in the concrete as in the abstract. We take our stand on the solidarity of humanity, the oneness of life, and the unnaturalness and injustice of all special favoritisms, whether of sex, race, country or condition. If one link of the chain be broken, the chain is broken. A bridge is no stronger than its weakest part, and a cause is not worthier than its weakest element.\ufeff\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Atlanta Washerwomen Strike (1881)\n\nLess than 20 years after the Civil War ended, thousands of black laundresses in Atlanta went on strike in the summer of 1881 to lobby state officials for higher wages and better working conditions, including greater control on how their work was organized.\n\nThe strike began with 20 black laundresses who formed the Washing Society, a trade union seeking \u201chigher pay, respect and autonomy over their work, and established a uniform rate at $1 per dozen pounds of wash,\u201d the AFL-CIO writes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOver three weeks of striking, the Washing Society expanded to include 3,000 strikers, including white laundresses (at the time, white women comprised less than 2 percent of washerwomen in Atlanta).\n\nThe Washing Society succeeded not only in raising wages, but inspired other domestic workers throughout the city to employ similar methods to advocate for their rights.\n\nIda B. Wells (1862-1931)\n\nA prominent journalist, Wells was also a suffragette and fought just as fervently for women\u2019s rights as she did for civil rights. She formed the first suffrage organization for black women, the Alpha Suffrage Club of Chicago, and is considered one of the first American women to keep her last name after marriage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike many of her peers, her advocacy for women was met with open racism from white feminists. At the 1913 Women\u2019s Suffrage Parade in Washington, D.C., white organizers demanded black women march at the back of the demonstration. When an Illinois organizer told Wells she could only march if she did so with an all-black delegation, the famed anti-lynching activist said she refused to join unless she could march under the Illinois banner.\n\nAnd march under that banner she did.\n\nLuisa Moreno (1907-1992)\n\nMoreno, a Guatemalan, never gained U.S. citizenship, but her work was instrumental in advancing the rights of women who work, particularly Latinas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA gifted labor organizer, she traveled throughout the South and California to call attention to the poor working conditions in sweatshops, canneries and agricultural fields. Moreno also brought awareness to the abuse of Latina workers in these industries.\n\nMaida Springer Kemp (1910-2005)\n\nA famed labor organizer, Springer Kemp was instrumental in advancing labor movements on four different continents, most notably in Africa. Springer Kemp used her leadership status to push for integration within unions. As USA Today writes, while organizing a drive for the war effort in 1942, Springer Kemp deliberately scheduled an event in Chinatown at which people from all backgrounds could participate:\n\n\u201cWe organized a blood bank with black and white workers laying table by table, giving blood because the Chinese didn\u2019t ask what color blood it was,\u201d Springer Kemp said, according to Daniel Katz\u2019s book, All Together Different. \u201cShe was one of the early leaders, who was a strong advocate for unionism and civil rights,\u201d says [historian Yvette Richards] Jordan, who teaches at George Mason University. \u201cShe saw those two movements in tandem.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFannie Lou Hamer (1917-1977)\n\nOne of the most commanding and passionate voices of the civil rights movement, Hamer was so powerful she had President Lyndon B. Johnson shook.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA former sharecropper, Hamer co-founded the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party and helped establish the National Women\u2019s Political Caucus toward the end of her life, in 1971.\n\nBut she is perhaps most well-known for her 1964 speech, \u201cI\u2019m Sick and Tired of Being Sick and Tired\u201d:\n\nFor 300 years, we\u2019ve given them time. And I\u2019ve been tired so long, now I am sick and tired of being sick and tired, and we want a change. We want a change in this society in America because, you see, we can no longer ignore the facts and getting our children to sing, \u201cOh say can you see, by the dawn\u2019s early light, what so proudly we hailed.\u201d What do we have to hail here? The truth is the only thing going to free us. And you know this whole society is sick. And to prove just how sick it was when we was in Atlantic City challenging the [Democratic] National Convention, when I was testifying before the Credentials Committee, I was cut off because they hate to see what they been knowing all the time, and that\u2019s the truth.\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSojourners for Truth and Justice (1951)\n\n\n\nMore than a decade before the 1963 March on Washington, there was the Sojourners for Truth and Justice. In 1951, this group of black women organized and descended upon Washington, D.C.\n\nThey were explicit in condemning the state\u2019s complicity in racist violence, particularly against black women. Combining socialist concepts with black nationalism, the group sought to mobilize black women in domestic fights and international fights for justice, protesting against Jim Crow as well as the United States\u2019 Cold War policies. While the radical protest organization was short-lived, it was the first communist-left group to be led by black women.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShirley Chisholm (1924-2005)\n\n\n\nIn 1968, the same year of Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s assassination, Chisholm became the first black woman to be elected to the U.S. Congress. The unbought and unbossed congresswoman co-founded the Congressional Black Caucus and was also the first African American major-party candidate for president and the first woman to run for the Democratic Party\u2019s presidential nomination.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer legislative achievements include championing a bill ensuring domestic workers received benefits, advocating for improved access to education and child care, fighting for the rights of immigrants and expanding the government-funded food stamps program (also known by the acronym SNAP) to every state.\n\nHer famous line, \u201cIf they don\u2019t give you a seat at the table, bring a folding chair,\u201d continues to inspire black women and women of color seeking public office to this day.\n\nDolores Huerta (b. 1930)\n\nPhoto: Damian Dovarganes (AP Photo)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCo-founder of the United Farm Workers of America union, Huerta is also the woman behind the movement\u2019s famous slogan, \u201cS\u00ed, se puede.\u201d Outraged by both racial and economic injustice, Huerta was indefatigable in her efforts to advance the wages and working conditions of California\u2019s farmworkers, most of whom were black, Mexican, Filipino, Japanese and Chinese working families. For this work, Huerta was threatened and attacked by farm owners and Teamsters, and beaten up by police.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen we talk about spiritual forces, I think that Hispanic women are more familiar with spiritual forces,\u201d Huerta once said. \u201cWe know what fasting is, and that it is part of the culture. We know what relationships are, and we know what sacrifice is.\u201d\n\n\n\nYuri Kochiyama (1921-2014)\n\nLauded in the Asian-American community as being \u201cahead of her time,\u201d Kochiyama was a staunch advocate for the rights of black, Latinx and indigenous communities as well as Asian Americans. A Japanese American, her family was among those interned during World War II, an experience that would profoundly impact Kochiyama and her fight for racial justice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring her years as a human rights activist, Kochiyama advocated for black liberation, Puerto Rican independence and the rights of political prisoners. In the 1980s, she and her husband successfully lobbied the U.S. government to grant reparations and issue a formal apology to Japanese Americans forced into internment camps during World War II.\n\nAudre Lorde (1934-1992)\n\n\n\nBefore \u201cintersectional feminism\u201d entered the mainstream, Lorde embodied its ideals. A self-described \u201cblack, lesbian, mother, warrior, poet,\u201d Lorde\u2019s writing and activism centered on dismantling racist, homophobic and sexist structures, and recognized those battles as fights that were part and parcel of each other.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, her famous line about using the \u201cmaster\u2019s tools\u201d to dismantle the master\u2019s house was directed toward the feminist movement, and it\u2019s worth remembering the quote in full:\n\nThe master\u2019s tools will never dismantle the master\u2019s house. They may allow us temporarily to beat him at his own game, but they will never enable us to bring about genuine change. And this fact is only threatening to those women who still define the master\u2019s house as their only source of support.\n\nLorde added: \u201cWhat does it mean when the tools of a racist patriarchy are used to examine the fruits of that same patriarchy?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarsha P. Johnson (1945-1992)\n\nA pioneer for trans rights, Johnson was a key figure in the 1969 Stonewall uprising, during which members of the LGBT community confronted police following a violent raid on a gay bar by New York City police. Stonewall is seen as a major turning point in the LGBT fight for equal rights, and Johnson was among the vanguard.\n\nFrom her recent New York Times obit:\n\n\u201cMarsha P. Johnson could be perceived as the most marginalized of people\u2014 black, queer, gender-nonconforming, poor,\u201d said Susan Stryker, an associate professor of gender and women\u2019s studies at the University of Arizona. \u201cYou might expect a person in such a position to be fragile, brutalized, beaten down. Instead, Marsha had this joie de vivre, a capacity to find joy in a world of suffering. She channeled it into political action, and did it with a kind of fierceness, grace and whimsy, with a loopy, absurdist reaction to it all.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAngela Davis (b. 1944)\n\nOne of the most iconic figures of the Black Power movement, Davis rejected the idea that black women ought to choose between the women\u2019s movement and the black rights movement. In her influential book, Women, Race and Class, Davis examined the history of black women in the United States through a Marxist perspective. In the book, she highlighted the reproductive rights movement and how sterilization programs on communities of color complicated their relationship to the movement.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2013, Davis wrote:\n\nFeminism involves so much more than gender equality. And it involves so much more than gender. Feminism must involve a consciousness of capitalism (I mean, the feminism that I relate to. And there are multiple Feminisms, right). It has to involve a consciousness of capitalism and racism and colonialism and post colonialities and ability and more genders than we can even imagine, and more sexualities than we ever thought we could name.\n\nCombahee River Collective (1974)\n\nFounded in Boston by three self-identified queer black feminists, Demita Frazier, Beverly Smith and Barbara Smith, the Combahee River Collective issued one of the clearest and most effective documents on the intersections of racial, gender and sexual oppression. They have also been recently credited with articulating the true inclusive power of identity politics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMost radical politics come directly\u201d from black women\u2019s identity, the women wrote in the Combahee River Collective Statement:\n\nIf black women were free, it would mean that everyone else would have to be free since our freedom would necessitate the destruction of all the systems of oppression.\n\nMay Chen (b. 1948)\n\n\n\nIn June 1982, Chen led one of the largest Asian-American strikes in history in New York\u2019s Chinatown. Through the International Ladies\u2019 Garment Workers\u2019 Union, 20,000 garment workers, most of them women, took to the streets to push back on wage cuts and benefit cutbacks from their employers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWinona LaDuke (b. 1959)\n\nAn indigenous activist, environmentalist and writer, LaDuke\u2019s life work centers on protecting Native lands and life ways. It is through our relationship with the earth, LaDuke says, that communities derive their power, and only by challenging current hierarchies and paradigms can real gender progress be made:\n\nI don\u2019t understand all the nuances of the women\u2019s movement. But I do understand that there are feminists who want to challenge the dominant paradigm, not only of patriarchy, but of where the original wealth came from and the relationship of that wealth to other peoples and the earth. That is the only way that I think you can really get to the depth of the problem. \ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPaulette Barnes, Diane Williams, Sandra Bundy and Mechelle Vinson\n\nIn the \u201970s and \u201980s, the cases of these four black women\u2014all government employees who had been sexually harassed at their respective jobs\u2014helped expand civil rights protections to include sexual harassment as a form of sex discrimination. Before, legal definitions of sex discrimination were narrower, confined to outright assault or being denied employment because of one\u2019s gender. These women\u2019s individual lawsuits, and subsequent landmark legal victories, helped redefine protections for women in the workplace in ways that reverberate to today.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: An earlier version of this list included noted Cherokee Nation Chief Wilma Mankiller.

In fact, he\u2019s a pathological liar with a history of lying and then just nonchalantly acting as if what he\u2019s doing isn\u2019t lying.\n\n\n\nDuring one stretch from Jan 21. to Feb. 27, the New York Times found that the president lied publicly some 38 times. He lied about not being a fan of the Iraq War, which he totally was. He lied about how many times he appeared on Time magazine\u2019s cover; he claimed that he\u2019d been on the cover more than anyone else, but turns out he\u2019d been on the cover 15 times and former President Richard Nixon had appeared 55 times. He even lied about about two people getting shot in Chicago the same day President Barack Obama was in town making a speech; reports confirmed that no one was shot the day Obama delivered his speech.\n\nTrump lies; it\u2019s just what he does. While his lies are easily disproved, it\u2019s rare that he will readily admit that he lied, much less admit it to another world leader. The Washington Post got its hands on a fundraising speech Trump made Wednesday in which he openly admitted to making up claims during his meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. He just randomly spouted that the United States runs a trade deficit with Canada without even knowing whether that was true.\n\nHere\u2019s how the Post breaks down the audio of Trump speaking during a private event:\n\n\u201cTrudeau came to see me. He\u2019s a good guy, Justin. He said, \u2018No, no, we have no trade deficit with you, we have none. Donald, please,\u2019 \u201d Trump said, mimicking Trudeau. [...] \u201cNice guy, good-looking guy, comes in \u2014 \u2018Donald, we have no trade deficit.\u2019 He\u2019s very proud because everybody else, you know, we\u2019re getting killed. \u201c ...

In fact, he\u2019s a pathological liar with a history of lying and then just nonchalantly acting as if what he\u2019s doing isn\u2019t lying.\n\n\n\nDuring one stretch from Jan 21. to Feb. 27, the New York Times found that the president lied publicly some 38 times. He lied about not being a fan of the Iraq War, which he totally was. He lied about how many times he appeared on Time magazine\u2019s cover; he claimed that he\u2019d been on the cover more than anyone else, but turns out he\u2019d been on the cover 15 times and former President Richard Nixon had appeared 55 times. He even lied about about two people getting shot in Chicago the same day President Barack Obama was in town making a speech; reports confirmed that no one was shot the day Obama delivered his speech.\n\nTrump lies; it\u2019s just what he does. While his lies are easily disproved, it\u2019s rare that he will readily admit that he lied, much less admit it to another world leader. The Washington Post got its hands on a fundraising speech Trump made Wednesday in which he openly admitted to making up claims during his meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. He just randomly spouted that the United States runs a trade deficit with Canada without even knowing whether that was true.\n\nHere\u2019s how the Post breaks down the audio of Trump speaking during a private event:\n\n\u201cTrudeau came to see me. He\u2019s a good guy, Justin. He said, \u2018No, no, we have no trade deficit with you, we have none. Donald, please,\u2019 \u201d Trump said, mimicking Trudeau. [...] \u201cNice guy, good-looking guy, comes in \u2014 \u2018Donald, we have no trade deficit.\u2019 He\u2019s very proud because everybody else, you know, we\u2019re getting killed. \u201c ... So, he\u2019s proud. I said, \u2018Wrong, Justin, you do.\u2019 I didn\u2019t even know. ... I had no idea. I just said, \u2018You\u2019re wrong.\u2019 You know why?

Kennedy Library and Museum in Boston held a special exhibit celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Jacqueline Bouvier and John F. Kennedy nuptials. Visitors got to see various mementos from the 1953 wedding, considered the social event of the season at the time. A highlight of the exhibit was Bouvier\u2019s ivory silk-taffeta bridal dress, which received a lot of media attention for its exquisite design. It also sparked renewed interest in the woman who made it: Ann Lowe, a little-known African-American designer who specialized in formal wear for wealthy socialites.\n\n\n\nPhoto: AP Images\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI first learned about Ann Lowe years ago when I went up to what was then the Black Fashion Museum in Harlem,\u201d recalls Valerie Steele, fashion historian and director of the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City, where several of Lowe\u2019s dresses are housed. \u201cWhat struck me was that she was a custom dressmaker to elite, white society, which was a significant genre,\u201d says Steele.\n\n\n\n\u201cI love my clothes and I\u2019m particular about who wears them,\u201d Lowe famously told Ebony magazine. \u201cI am not interested in sewing for caf\u00e9 society or social climbers. I do not cater to Mary and Sue. I sew for families of the Social Register.\u201d The story of how she became one of their most sought-after designers is quite remarkable.\n\nDelaware Public Media/YouTube\n\nBorn in 1898 in Clayton, Ala., Lowe came from a family of dressmakers. Her grandmother Georgia Cole made clothes for her plantation mistress before becoming a free woman in 1860, and her mother, Jane Lowe, was an expert seamstress and embroiderer. Learning from both women, Lowe became skilled at creating intricate fabric flower adornments that would later become one of her signatures. The women eventually moved to Montgomery, Ala., where they ran a successful dressmaking business. When her mother died suddenly while making gowns for the governor\u2019s wife and daughters, Lowe, then 16, completed the project and subsequently headed the family business.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA wealthy Floridian impressed with Lowe\u2019s skills invited her to move to Tampa and become her family\u2019s seamstress. As word of her talent spread, her clientele increased.\n\n\u201cThere have always been black women who were dressmakers,\u201d says Audrey Smaltz, former Ebony Fashion Fair commentator and founder of the Ground Crew backstage management company. \u201cIf they had a dressmaking job in a white lady\u2019s house and that lady was looking good, she would also subcontract the dressmaker out to others. That\u2019s how black women got to be seamstresses. They\u2019d work for one family and maybe that family would help her [become established].\u201d\n\nWith her employer\u2019s support and encouragement, Lowe enrolled at the S.T. Taylor School of Design in New York. She studied alone in a separate classroom because white students did not want to attend class with a \u201cNegro.\u201d Ironically, her designs were often upheld as examples in the same classes she was forbidden to attend, and she successfully completed her two-year design program in half the time. Lowe returned to Tampa, opened a shop, and hired 18 seamstresses to help her keep pace with requests for balls, cotillions and other formal affairs. Business was good, but Lowe was eager to fulfill her dream of working in New York City. Taking $20,000 in savings, she closed shop and headed north.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Great Depression hit soon after she arrived in the city. To make ends meet, she took work designing and sewing for prestige labels like A.F. Chantilly and Sonia Gowns. Those jobs were her introduction to New York society\u2014and its introduction to her\u2014though its members wouldn\u2019t immediately know it, because the labels on her creations bore the company\u2019s name.\n\n\n\nLowe\u2019s career really took off during the prosperous postwar years when wealthy women flocked to the opera, theater and galas and needed the appropriate attire. Debutante balls were growing in popularity as well, so there was a new generation of socialites to design for. \u201cThe girls were coming out in those days, and she was so good at making cotillion dresses,\u201d Smaltz says. \u201cShe had lots of upper-echelon clients\u201d\u2014du Ponts, Roosevelts, Rockefellers, Whitneys, Posts, Bouviers and Auchinclosses among them.\n\nLowe opened Ann Lowe\u2019s Gowns in Harlem in 1950, and Ann Lowe\u2019s Originals on Manhattan\u2019s Madison Avenue in 1968, making her the first African American to have a business on the high-end retail strip.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA 1966 Saturday Evening Post article called Lowe \u201cSociety\u2019s Best Kept Secret,\u201d a description that Steele says could be a double-edged sword. \u201cOn the one hand, people really liked her work. On the other hand, they weren\u2019t exactly boasting that this beautiful dress they had was made by an African-American designer,\u201d Steele says. \u201cThey probably would have been just as happy to have people think, \u2018Oh, maybe she\u2019s wearing Dior.\u2019 It didn\u2019t help her business that people weren\u2019t talking her up.\u201d\n\nAnother detriment to business was that Lowe, succumbing to pressure from clients, often sold dresses for much less than they were worth. Mounting business debts and back taxes forced her to declare bankruptcy and shutter her first store in the early 1960s. Thanks to an anonymous benefactor who paid off her debts, Lowe rebounded and continued to work at her Madison Avenue store until her retirement in 1972.\n\nThanks to some recent efforts, Lowe is having another fashion moment. An exhibit of her dresses at the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C., is exposing thousands of visitors to her legacy and artistry. Julia Faye Smith\u2019s 2016 biography, Something to Prove: A Biography of Ann Lowe, America\u2019s Forgotten Designer, filled with archival pictures, puts Lowe\u2019s life and career in historical context. And there is even a children\u2019s book, Fancy Party Gowns: The Story of Fashion Designer Ann Cole Lowe, by Deborah Blumenthal and Laura Freeman, which introduces little ones to this American great. May she never fall into obscurity again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFive Fab Facts About Ann Lowe", "keywords": ["ann", "york", "women", "societys", "gowns", "lowe", "lowes", "business", "designer", "knew", "stylish", "fashion", "work", "force", "museum", "secret"], "polarity": 0.24201031652330354, "subjectivity": 0.4269803789284308},

But admittedly, we can sometimes get a bit myopic and materialistic when covering fashion shows and the latest looks on the red carpet. That\u2019s why we\u2019re grateful that International Women\u2019s Day exists, to pull us out of our own beauty- and fashion-obsessed heads, for a least a day.\n\n\n\nBut we\u2019d like to make that broader focus last more than just today\u2014and last at least all month, since it\u2019s also Women\u2019s History Month. When we thought about how we wanted to celebrate International Women\u2019s Day, we thought we should focus on something that has an ongoing positive impact in women\u2019s lives. Fittingly, we settled on something that also happens to be one of our favorite activities: shopping.\n\nThis year\u2019s International Women\u2019s Day theme is \u201cTime Is Now: Rural and Urban Activists Transforming Women\u2019s Lives.\u201d Notably, there are fashion brands and entrepreneurial initiatives around the world doing the work of supporting and empowering women around the world. So don\u2019t just drop a dollar; drop gems by spending your money with female entrepreneurs who are trying to turn the world around, one thoughtful purchase at a time.\n\nMalawi is one of the poorest countries on the planet, where only 33 percent of school-age children ever attend school. In Chichewa, Malawi\u2019s native language, tiwale means \u201clet us shine/glow.\u201d This youth-led, community-based organization, founded by DJ, artist and one of Forbes\u2019 Africa\u2019s 30 Under 30 Ellen Chilemba, has a stated mission of \u201cempowering women to develop sustainable ventures that transform our communities from poverty-stricken to entrepreneur-vital.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTiwale runs programs providing school grants and mentorship, training, microloans and even a blog featuring African female writers. The goods produced are for sale on its site; 40 percent go back to the participants of the program, while the remaining 60 percent support Tiwale\u2019s programming.\n\nThis charity and brand creates ethical and sustainable womenswear and lifestyle items, produced in the Mayamiko Fashion Lab in Malawi by the team of tailors, pattern cutters and seamstresses the label trains and employs through fully funded workshops. Founded by Paola Masperi, the Mayamiko Fashion Lab \u201cwas designed to provide training, education, nutrition, sanitation and fairer trade practices to all of those involved ... many of whom are affected by the HIV pandemic or who are carers of HIV orphans. After their training all trainees receive a recognized qualification as well as mentoring, guidance and access to a microfinance scheme, enabling them to start their own business.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd for those who choose to stay on with Mayamiko, the label pays living wages \u201cso that more people can be employed and lifted out of poverty.\u201d\n\nWouldn\u2019t you love to start a business doing something you love that, in the process, takes care of black women and their families?

Lemlem is committed to elevating artisanship and expanding production and jobs across Africa. In a quote from Kebede on the brand\u2019s official website: \u201cBy employing traditional weavers, we\u2019re trying to break their cycle of poverty, at the same time preserving the art of weaving while creating modern, casual, comfortable stuff that we really want to wear.\u201d Access to education, health care, fair wages and safe working conditions, and you can get this in exchange for wearing some really cool-looking comfortable clothes? That\u2019s smart shopping.\n\nIn Africa, shea butter is called \u201cwomen\u2019s gold.\u201d Why? Because 16 million women make a living in West Africa picking the nuts that become shea butter. Shea Radiance, founded in 2010 by a Nigerian-American mother on a quest to treat her kids suffering from eczema, embodies the phrase \u201ccharity begins at home.\u201d By taking care of the needs of the few, she created a means to take care of many.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy March of 2013, the company website reports, Shea Radiance had trained more than 300 small businesses to \u201cThink Global and Act Local\u201d through a selection of workshops, including soap making, formulation, access to finance, business plan development and marketing.\n\nShea butter is an incredible gift to women on so many levels: from the shea producer in the village to the small-business owner who manufactures products for the local market.\n\nLeila Janah\u2019s mission is \u201cto give work.\u201d As a self-taught skin-care aficionado and founder and CEO of the global poverty-fighting nonprofit Samasource, Janah\u2019s latest venture is LXMI (pronounced \u201cluxe-me\u201d), a skin-care company based on the rare nut butter (and relative of shea) nilotica, which is available on LXMI\u2019s site and QVC and at 300 Sephora locations worldwide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJanah first encountered nilotica while visiting Uganda, and immediately saw its potential. With sourcing from the banks of the Nile, and by employing local harvesters and fair-trade practices, this skin-care brand is great not just for your skin but also for your ethical impact, as its website states:\n\nIn fact, we promise that for each of our primary ingredient harvests, our producers earn at least 3x the local average wage. These living wages will help chip away at some of the world\u2019s most serious problems, from childhood malnutrition to human trafficking.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGlobal Goods Partners launched in 2005 as a not-for-profit social enterprise with a commitment to providing sustainable jobs for women. Since that time, it has partnered with women-led, community-based organizations and over 60 artisan groups in more than 20 countries throughout Africa, Asia and the Americas.\n\nIts products are handcrafted by artisans who make a fair living wage for each product they produce, as well as have access to training and funding to sustain their own enterprise. The company has also awarded more than $150,000 in financial grants to its partners around the globe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShoe designer Aurora James is a darling of the business of global luxury fashion accessories, and she did it by helping black women in Africa live and work with dignity. James earned her stripes in the fashion world traveling the globe with her mother, who sourced hard-to-find, unique artisan fashions for wealthy clients in New York, London and Paris.\n\nBrother Vellies\u2014which comes from the South African slang term for a man\u2019s flat shoe, a stock staple of her collection\u2014employs weavers, cobblers and Maribou feather-makers from one end the African continent to the other. James\u2019 commitment to fair-trade practices and using African artisans proves that while most of us don\u2019t know the struggle that our African brothers and sisters face on the daily, we can help change their lives by walking a mile in their shoes.\n\nClothed in Hope\u2019s mission is \u201cto empower women in Zambia through education and economic opportunity.\u201d It does that by helping women create sustainable businesses through offering a yearlong life-skills-training program in sewing and entrepreneurship; development focusing on women\u2019s empowerment; education to vulnerable women in health, disease prevention and nutrition; providing microloans to assist in launching independent, sustainable businesses; and marketing and selling Zambian-designed and -produced accessories and home goods to help women generate income.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince its launch in 2012, more than 254 women have joined its life-skills-training program, over 75 have received microloans to start businesses (with a 100 percent repayment rate), and over 888 children have benefited as a result of the empowerment of their mothers.\n\nAble is a lifestyle brand that promises \u201cbeautiful products by women who have overcome.\u201d Its mission is \u201cfocused on ending generational poverty by working with women who have often overcome extraordinary circumstances.

Able now prides itself on disrupting that cycle through its empowering and transparent business practices, saying:\n\nWhether your purchase is produced in Ethiopia, Mexico, Peru or at our headquarters in Nashville, Tenn., each item has one thing in common: through working with women, it is leading all of us a step closer to the end of generational poverty.

Upon further investigation, information surfaced that the suspect is connected with Atomwaffen, an organization of avowed fascists who worship Adolf Hitler, Charles Manson and\u2014of course\u2014racism.\n\n\n\nOn Jan. 2, University of Pennsylvania student Blaze Bernstein, who was Jewish and an out gay man, disappeared while he was visiting his Lake Forest, Calif., home for winter break. After an exhaustive search, police found Bernstein\u2019s body in a nearby park covered with loose leaves and dirt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe teen had been stabbed at least 20 times, according to the Washington Post. The investigation quickly focused on Woodward, who was communicating with Bernstein on Snapchat the night of the disappearance, and authorities eventually found DNA evidence connecting Woodward with the killing.\n\nPro Publica has revealed that Woodward is an avowed Nazi and a member of one of the most unrepentantly racist organizations in the country\u2014Atomwaffen, which means \u201catomic weapon.\u201d According to friends of Woodward and former members of the group, the organization is an armed fascist group dedicated to the overthrow of the U.S. government through the use of terrorism and guerrilla tactics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the report, Woodward joined Atomwaffen in early 2016 and trained with the group during a three-day camp in Texas to learn about the use of firearms, hand-to-hand combat, survival skills and\u2014one would presume\u2014the secret Nazi handshake. (Which, I would wager, is how Donald Trump begins every Cabinet meeting.) Woodward eventually recruited members in California.\n\nAtomwaffen was reportedly inspired by James Mason, who left the American Nazi Party in the 1970s, complaining that it was too moderate, to start the Universal Order Movement under the advice of Manson, because ... who better to take advice from than a mass murderer who has a swastika carved in his forehead? That shows commitment if nothing else. It makes my Black Lives Matter T-shirt feel very inadequate.\n\nMason\u2019s writings are required reading for the group, which is slightly concerned about the \u201cJewish oligarchies and the globalist bankers\u201d that have caused the \u201ccultural and racial displacement of the white race,\u201d according to Atomwaffen\u2019s website. (Of course I\u2019m not providing you with a link. Google it yourself if you\u2019re so curious.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAtomwaffen says it is only for radicals and has no time for \u201ckeyboard warriors.\u201d Yes, it says this on the website. If you\u2019re thinking that makes no sense, maybe you are forgetting that none of this makes any sense! They\u2019re motherfucking Nazis who hang out in the woods and think they\u2019re going to overthrow the government because white people are being oppressed!\n\nIf the name \u201cAtomwaffen\u201d sounds familiar to you, it might be because it sounds like some bomb-ass waffles, or it may be because you heard the name in the case of 18-year-old Brandon Russell, whom authorities questioned when two of his fellow Nazi roommates were murdered. During the investigation, officers found that Russell possessed explosive material, a framed photograph of Timothy McVeigh and a copy of Hitler\u2019s Mein Kampf. Russell told authorities that he had started his own group called\u2014you guessed it\u2014Atomwaffen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother teenage member of the group allegedly killed his girlfriend\u2019s parents in Virginia after the parents found Nicholas Giampa in the room with their teenage daughter. Buckley Kuhn-Fricker, 43, and her husband, Scott Fricker, 48, were killed at their home in Reston in December after the husband and wife forbade their child to date the Hitler Youth wannabe when they found social media posts of their daughter\u2019s 17-year-old boyfriend praising Hitler and calling for a white revolution.\n\nThe alleged murder occurred only weeks after Giampa gave the family free lawn service. Some might say the boy raised the family\u2019s ire by mowing a 40-foot swastika in their front lawn. Those people are so ungrateful.\n\nGiampa\u2019s social media was littered with references to Atomwaffen, including pictures of Hitler and Giampa\u2019s efforts to convince his mother to buy a copy of Mason\u2019s book, The Siege.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe group\u2019s website says that they were formed in 2013 as a revolutionary nationalist organization centered on the fascist lifestyle.\n\nAll of this raises three interesting, and maybe unrelated, questions:", "keywords": ["wants", "murder", "woodward", "race", "group", "white", "organization", "war", "5th", "russell", "hitler", "website", "tied", "authorities", "start", "nazi", "overthrow", "atomwaffen"], "polarity": 0.050787545787545796, "subjectivity": 0.31133089133089137},

And just so you know how much Beyonc\u00e9 a million and change will get you, the auction\u2019s description is as follows:\n\nThe collection is now comprised of 19 videotapes (previously 11) that contain the footage from Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s first two professionally produced music video productions. These videos were never officially released and the footage in the collection used to create them is nearly three hours in length. Included are Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s rehearsals, performances and outtakes that were shot before, during and after an onstage performance with her group Girl\u2019s Tyme at the BMI New Music showcase at the DNA Lounge in San Francisco on Aug. 26, 1992. Also included are scenes shot at the Plant Recording Studios in Sausalito, Calif., during the time Beyonc\u00e9 was there to record her first professionally produced and engineered recordings. There is also footage from a third location\u2014a shopping mall\u2014where Beyonc\u00e9 is acting for the camera beside her longtime friend and Destiny\u2019s Child member / Grammy Award Winner LaTavia Roberson. In addition, the collection includes the edited master tapes and work-in-progress tapes from Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s first two music video productions. The collection has been locked in storage for more than 20 years and has only been seen by a select few people since being recorded.\n\nIf you\u2019re the Sultan of Brunei-level of Beyonc\u00e9 fan who feels they absolutely must have these pre-Auto-Tune performances in their life, our guess is that you can also afford to track down a Betacam player before the auction ends on March 13.

I say that because, often, clothes can be pretty but puzzling at the same time. Now, under the direction of designer Maria Grazia Chiuri, Dior speaks to women loud and clear. What\u2019s Grazia Chiuri got to say? For one, \u201cWe Should All Be Feminists\u201d\u2014the theme of her breakout collection for the house of Dior for Spring 2017.\n\nThe theme was taken from the essay of the same name written by the Nigerian writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, a brilliant manifesto on womanhood and citizenship that reads like the Wakandan Bill of Rights. Most people who wear the now ubiquitous T-shirt don\u2019t know its origin, but they\u2019ve gotten the message that the future is female.\n\nChimamanda Ngozi Adichie (Ted Talks)\n\nWhich brings us to Wednesday\u2019s Dior Fall/Winter 2018/2019 presentation in Paris, where Dior\u2019s women were still on the march. The collection was inspired by Paris\u2019 \u201cyouthquake\u201d in the summer of 1968, when students literally took to the streets, ripping cobblestones from the ground and hurling them at police, demanding better employment opportunities and reform of the university system. Being ever fashion-minded, young women protested long hemlines in front of the Dior boutique, brandishing signs reading, \u201cSupport the Mini Skirt.\u201d\n\nGrazia Chiuri, who is Italian and the former designer of Valentino, stumbled upon the photo while searching Dior\u2019s archives, as she recounted to London\u2019s Guardian newspaper:\n\nAnd then I discovered that [Marc] Bohan\u2019s response, [who designed Dior at the time], to this was to introduce the Miss Dior line, to give these younger consumers what they wanted. I thought it was so interesting to see fashion listening to women. And there is something about now that is similar to 1968. This is another moment when everything is changing.\n\nYes, we are again in a moment when everything is changing regarding women in the workplace and shaping the perception of our own beauty and our bodies. With the advent of social media\u2014which in this writer\u2019s opinion has done as much for black women\u2019s beauty as hip-hop has done for black men\u2019s voices\u2014we are in an era of unparalleled agency on our own behalf. Grazia Chiuri is listening, and poised to provide us the uniform.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDior Fall 2018 Paris Runway (Dominique Charriau/Getty/WireImage) Dior Fall \u201918 Paris Runway (Dominique Charriau/Getty/WireImage) Dior Fall \u201918 Paris Runway (Dominique Charriau Getty/WireImage) Dior Fall \u201918 Paris Runway (Dominique Charriau Getty/WireImage) 1 / 4\n\nThe clothes at Dior this week were a throwback to a time when flower power and femininity were one and the same. Long, easy dresses in bright floral prints, patchwork coats and rose-colored glasses to no doubt help us get through dark times sailed down the runway with a youthful ease. Mixed in were sweaters emblazoned with slogans like \u201cC\u2019est non, non et non\u201d (\u201cIt\u2019s no, no and no\u201d), in a nod to the new-age rules of sexual consent.\n\nAnother strong theme shown at Dior and trending across runways from New York, London, Milan and now Paris this season were relaxed boxy blazers worn over kilts and pleated skirts. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s so much that designers want women to be schoolgirls, but it\u2019s a way to show that women are teaching the world right now\u2014and changing the rules for the better.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarch on, ladies. On this first day of Women\u2019s History Month, we owe our mothers a debt and our daughters a future of freedom and dignity for womanhood across the globe.

As one fan puts it, she\u2019s gone \u201cfrom the hood to Hollywood.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCardi B\u2019s song was released in June and immediately hustled up the charts; Billboard reports it was \u201cthe quickest ascent to No. 1 by a lead artist\u2019s debut chart entry since Psy\u2019s \u2018Gangnam Style\u2019 shot to the summit in its second frame in 2012.\u201d But at the end of August, just a few weeks after Cardi B went to number one on the Rap charts, Taylor Swift dropped \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d and went directly to number one on the Billboard Hot 100, knocking \u201cDespacito\u201d out of the top slot\u2014the white woman deporting the immigrant and sliding into first ahead of the woman of color.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFurthermore, at the MTV Video Music Awards, Cardi B gave a shoutout to NFL star Colin Kaepernick\u2014who, last season, kneeled during the national anthem to protest police violence against black people\u2014saying, \u201cAs long as you kneel with us, we\u2019re going to be standing for you, baby. That\u2019s right, I said it!\u201d\n\nThe result is a battle for number one that feels more like a battle for America\u2019s soul, with fans hopeful that Cardi B can reach number one, thereby taking with her and uplifting everyone who\u2019s ever felt oppressed, outnumbered, underrepresented, disadvantaged, or underprivileged. As journalist George M Johnson put it on Twitter, \u201cIf Cardi B unseats Taylor Swift, we might have a shot of surviving Trump.\u201d The new Billboard charts are released on Tuesday.

See, it\u2019s all about branding.\n\n\n\nMany of the people in the alt-right don\u2019t consider themselves \u201cwhite supremacists\u201d (we will explain that term later), and some white supremacists don\u2019t consider themselves \u201calt-right.\u201d\n\nIf the alt-right were a family, the Ku Klux Klan, neo-Nazis and skinheads would be the grandparents, aunts and uncles who get their plates fixed first, while the anti-globalists, anti-feminists and \u201cracialists\u201d would sit at the kids\u2019 table and have to drink out of paper cups.\n\nThe alternative right is composed of many disparate beliefs, but they are all united by one thing (aside from below-average IQ and penis length): They are all racists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProminent alt-righters: Tucker Carlson, Steve Bannon, people who use the word \u201ccuck\u201d\n\nIdentifying call: \u201cMake America great again\u201d\n\nWhite Supremacists\n\nOne of the greatest misconceptions is that all racist groups are white supremacist organizations. White supremacists are characterized by their belief that white people are superior. They believe all others are physically, mentally and morally weaker than the great Caucasian race. The concept of white supremacy is one of the oldest racist philosophies, which originated from their need to explain their need to rape, pillage and conquer the world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey have constructed a web of conspiratorial plots involving the Jews, the new world order and traitorous whites who explain everything from why white people run so slow and jump so low to why unseasoned chicken tastes better. White supremacy gave birth to the Nazi Party, the KKK and \u201cCan I touch your hair?\u201d\n\nProminent white supremacists: Adolf Hitler, Fred Trump, Andrew Anglin, people who hate affirmative action\n\nIdentifying call: \u201cWhite power!\u201d\n\nWhite Nationalists\n\nWhite nationalism is different from white supremacy in that white nationalists seek to maintain a white identity for America. While they don\u2019t necessarily espouse the belief that white people are superior (many of them believe it, but they don\u2019t say it), they contend that the United States of America is a white country founded by white people and should, therefore, remain white.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhite nationalists believe in the purity of \u201cWestern culture\u201d and \u201cEuropean values,\u201d which created chattel slavery, genocide, colonialism, the Holocaust and crocs.\n\nOf all the different kinds of racists, white nationalists have the most selective of memories. They completely forget the fact that the only reason America became an economic superpower is that it benefited from 250 years of free labor. They forget that they \u201cbuilt\u201d this country by massacring the Native Americans. They also forget who created the music, culture, art, dance, economy, armed forces and entire culture they call \u201cAmerican.\u201d\n\nProminent white nationalists: White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller, Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa), most other guys named Steve\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIdentifying call: \u201cMy people built this country!\u201d\n\nRacialists\n\nRacialism is a particular strain of white supremacist belief. Unlike KKK members, racialists can often be found wearing suits and ties. They believe they are more intelligent than the swastika wearers and rest their beliefs in a brand of pseudoscience that cherry-picks IQ tests and crime statistics in their desire to state that blacks, Muslims and any nonwhite person are genetically inferior to Caucasians.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen racialists talk about crime, they leave out the part about 84 percent of white people being killed by white people. When they speak of IQ, they casually leave out the part that Asians consistently score higher than whites or that socioeconomic status is a better predictor of test scores than race.\n\nProminent racialists: Author of The Bell Curve Charles A. Murray, Stefan Molyneux\n\nIdentifying call: \u201cBut what about black-on-black crime?\u201d\n\nChristian Identitarians\n\nIf white nationalists had a baby with the blond, blue-eyed, ripped-abs Jesus, the resulting child would be the Christian Identity movement. Although it is seldom spoken of when the subject of extremism is discussed, the Christian Identity movement is a very large sect of white supremacy. Adherents believe that white people (usually the British) are the true children of Israel and that the Jews are a group of usurpers who control the world because they descended from Cain ... or the devil ... or some other nonsense you\u2019d never guess a rational human being could believe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile you might think this all sounds extreme, you would be surprised at the number of people who believe in this bullshit. In fact, almost all of the groups and individuals you hear about trying to kick off a race war adhere to some tenet of this faith, which says that Jesus won\u2019t come back until his \u201ckingdom\u201d is prepared by a genocidal race war similar to the Islamic State group caliphate. Then, and only then, will our lord and savior Jesus Christ return to wipe the mongrel races from the face of the earth, and they can live in eternity with terrible music and shitty potato salad.\n\nProminent Christian Identitarians: Dylann Roof, members of a shitload of churches near you\n\nIdentifying call: \u201cYea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of niggers, I will fear no evil.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhite Separatists\n\nWhite separatists are different from white nationalists. While white nationalists would be OK with black people being in this country as long as they didn\u2019t have to be around them, white separatists want an ethnic cleansing. They want their own whites-only utopia before Jesus comes.\n\nPeople have tried it before. Randy Weaver tried it at Ruby Ridge. A man named Craig Cobb tried to buy two different towns, make them all-white and name one of them after Donald Trump. A group of alt-right \u201cpatriots\u201d are trying to raise money to do something similar now. (Warning: If you want to move there, you must prove you know how to operate a handgun, shoot an AR-15 and pay a $32 application fee.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProminent white separatists: PayPal founder Peter Thiel, the entire country of apartheid South Africa, the cast of Friends\n\nIdentifying call: \u201cGo back to ... \u201d\n\nWhite Genociders\n\nOne of the newest philosophies in the world of racism is the belief in white genocide\u2014the idea that there is an organized effort to wipe out white people by outbreeding them, race mixing, promoting diversity and generally not allowing white people to rule the world. White genocide is the most laughable form of white tears because white genociders believe that whiteness is superior while simultaneously acknowledging that nonwhite DNA will eventually erase Caucasians from the face of the earth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor them, multiculturalism, interracial relationships and white people who like Beyonc\u00e9 are all a form of warfare against the white man. This is the only philosophy in all of racism that makes any sense because eventually, white genociders will be eliminated from the face of the earth.\n\nProminent white genociders: Richard Spencer, Cersei Lannister, fathers of white daughters\n\nIdentifying call: \u201cYou\u2019re dating who?

They believe that the Civil War was about \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d (and it was\u2014a state\u2019s right to allow the owning of slaves).

So ... not startling.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter studying a representative cross section of gun owners, researchers found that the people who have an emotional attachment to their guns were 78 percent white and 65 percent male. It must be noted that the sample size was small because\u2014despite widespread American gun ownership\u2014just 3 percent of the population owns half the guns in the country.\n\nRacial anxiety was a big reason for the uptick in gun ownership, according to Angela Stroud, a Northland College sociologist. Stroud went through concealed-weapon applications in Texas and interviewed applicants. She found that many of them wanted to protect their loved ones during the impending race war.\n\nApparently, Barack Obama came to the secret black meeting and told black people to attack the whites. (Wait ... you missed the meeting? It was great. Especially the catering. Best watermelon and Kool-Aid I ever tasted.) According to the report:\n\n... Stroud also discovered another motivation: racial anxiety. \u201cA lot of people talked about how important Obama was to get a concealed-carry license: \u2018He\u2019s for free health care, he\u2019s for welfare.\u2019 They were asking, \u2018Whatever happened to hard work?\u201d Obama\u2019s presidency, they feared, would empower minorities to threaten their property and families.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere are some of the more notable characteristics of the typical, emotionally attached gun owner:\n\nThey are less educated: According to Pew Research, about 26 percent of white college graduates own guns, compared with 40 percent of high school graduates and 42 percent of people with some college education. There is no significant difference in the rate of gun ownership across educational attainment among nonwhites.\n\n\n\nAccording to Pew Research, about 26 percent of white college graduates own guns, compared with 40 percent of high school graduates and 42 percent of people with some college education.

Pew Research shows that a larger percentage of blacks have been threatened with a firearm or know someone who has been shot, but white men are more likely to say they need a gun for protection. And while most blacks find gun violence to be a problem in their community, most Republicans say more guns would lead to less crime.\n\nSo there you have it. White men need guns to pretect them from the evil Negro monsters roaming the country.

That can\u2019t be right) examined a variety of studies on gun ownership, including a 2017 study by sociologists at Baylor University. Titled \u201cGun Culture in Action,\u201d the researchers created a \u201cgun-empowerment scale\u201d to study the habits and create a profile of the average gun owner.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat they found was startling. (And by \u201cstartling,\u201d I mean it reflected what people like Very Smart Brothas\u2019 Damon Young have been saying all along. So ... not startling.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter studying a representative cross section of gun owners, researchers found that the people who have an emotional attachment to their guns were 78 percent white and 65 percent male. It must be noted that the sample size was small because\u2014despite widespread American gun ownership\u2014just 3 percent of the population owns half the guns in the country.\n\nRacial anxiety was a big reason for the uptick in gun ownership, according to Angela Stroud, a Northland College sociologist. Stroud went through concealed-weapon applications in Texas and interviewed applicants. She found that many of them wanted to protect their loved ones during the impending race war.\n\nApparently, Barack Obama came to the secret black meeting and told black people to attack the whites. (Wait ... you missed the meeting? It was great. Especially the catering. Best watermelon and Kool-Aid I ever tasted.) According to the report:\n\n... Stroud also discovered another motivation: racial anxiety. \u201cA lot of people talked about how important Obama was to get a concealed-carry license: \u2018He\u2019s for free health care, he\u2019s for welfare.\u2019 They were asking, \u2018Whatever happened to hard work?\u201d Obama\u2019s presidency, they feared, would empower minorities to threaten their property and families.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere are some of the more notable characteristics of the typical, emotionally attached gun owner:\n\nThey are less educated: According to Pew Research, about 26 percent of white college graduates own guns, compared with 40 percent of high school graduates and 42 percent of people with some college education. There is no significant difference in the rate of gun ownership across educational attainment among nonwhites.\n\n\n\nAccording to Pew Research, about 26 percent of white college graduates own guns, compared with 40 percent of high school graduates and 42 percent of people with some college education.

Pew Research shows that a larger percentage of blacks have been threatened with a firearm or know someone who has been shot, but white men are more likely to say they need a gun for protection. And while most blacks find gun violence to be a problem in their community, most Republicans say more guns would lead to less crime.\n\nSo there you have it. White men need guns to pretect them from the evil Negro monsters roaming the country. They are stockpiling arms like the zombie apocalypse, despite the fact that white men are three times more likely than blacks to kill themselves with a firearm ...\n\nEven though white men are more likely to be shot by another white person ...\n\nRegardless of the studies that show a gun in the home is also more likely to kill someone in the home than an intruder ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd even though most children who die from gun injuries are killed by a parent, sibling relative or friend ...\n\nIt\u2019s the scary black people they worry about.\n\nThat\u2019s just science.", "keywords": ["men", "ownership", "stockpile", "college", "owners", "white", "afraid", "report", "guns", "study", "theyre", "researchers", "black", "science", "gun"], "polarity": 0.11358363042186571, "subjectivity": 0.4163055163790458},

It looks too constraining, the food is too mayonnaise- and mustard-based, and I have grown fond of clapping on the beat. However, after looking at cases like the saga of Brandon Russell, even though I am a proud, unapologetic man of African descent, I am comfortable enough in my blackness to admit one thing:\n\nBeing white must be amazing!\n\nAccording to NBC News, Russell was living in white supremacist utopia with three fellow neofascist members of the Army National Guard (because, for whatever reason, if they aren\u2019t living in their mother\u2019s basement\u2014white nationalists always have roommates) when one of his homeboys, Devon Arthur, went apeshit crazy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArthur held three people hostage in a Tampa, Fla., smoke shop (yeah, that\u2019s another thing about neo-Nazis: They vape a lot) and announced that he had converted to Islam and killed two of his roommates, claiming that his victims were white supremacists who were planning to go on a killing and bombing spree.\n\nWhile this story might already seem nuts to most people (including the part about a nonblack guy named Devon), it is pretty routine for white people in Florida. But don\u2019t worry, it gets more interesting\u2014even on the Sunshine State\u2019s Caucasian scale of craziness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRussell, the surviving roommate who wasn\u2019t killed in the prevape store slaughter by the Nazi-turned-Muslim part-time soldier, received a visit from police because cops are usually forced to follow up on leads from Army Nazi double murderers who reveal terrorist plots. It\u2019s kind of their thing.\n\nWhen a law-enforcement officer contacted Russell ... you know what? It is difficult for me to construct a paragraph containing all of the dangerous, crazy paraphernalia in Russell\u2019s possession. So here is a list:\n\nA cooler containing a \u201cwhite, cakelike substance.\u201d It turned out to be HMTD (no, not the shitty Android phone or the web programming language)\u2014a highly explosive chemical that law-enforcement officers call \u201cthe new weapon of choice\u201d among terrorists;\n\n\n\nA framed photograph of Timothy McVeigh, who killed 168 people in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing;\n\nA copy of The Turner Diaries, and other white supremacist literature;\n\nElectric matches, fuses and other bomb-detonating devices;\n\nA copy of Hitler\u2019s autobiography, Mein Kampf.\n\nDuring the interview, Russell also admitted that he had organized his own neo-Nazi group, named \u201cAtomwaffen,\u201d which is German for \u201catomic weapon.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, of course, you know what happened next:\n\nPolice took note of all this dangerous, extremist evidence, in conjunction with the testimony of Arthur\u2019s statement that Russell was planning to \u201cbomb infrastructure,\u201d and then did what any police in America would do: They said \u201cAight, bruh,\u201d and left Russell alone.\n\nThis is why it must be so lovely being white!\n\nFirst of all, where do you even get white-cake explosive powder? Is there a secret Caucasian supermarket that sells stuff white people buy? Because in conducting our own scientific research, The Root staff could not recall a \u201cwhite terrorist\u201d section in Books-a-Million or Barnes & Noble. (And we looked everywhere. There was a young-adult section, classic literature and even the section that sells Caucasian cookbooks that require people of color to double all the seasoning ingredients\u2014but we could not find The Turner Diaries or even the Cliffs Notes to Mein Kampf.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd how is it that no one alerted authorities when Russell showed up at Hobby Lobby with a photo of terrorist McVeigh and a coupon for half-off framing? It\u2019s the same reason that no one skips social studies class even when a white guy comes to homeroom wearing a black trench coat in June\u2014because whiteness is never associated with danger. They are usually off their meds or have played too many video games. They\u2019re just \u201ctroubled,\u201d at most.\n\nBut mostly, they\u2019re just white.\n\nThe Washington Post reports that as soon as the cops left, Russell went to the gun store and bought a cache of hunting weapons because that\u2019s what crazy, Nazi bomb-makers do to wind down after a long day of police interrogation. In their defense, as soon as investigators heard about this, they doubled back and arrested Russell.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnce he was in the custody of federal authorities, Russell attended a bail hearing. There are two things a judge is supposed to consider in a bail hearing: whether the person poses a danger to the community and the likelihood that the person charged with a crime will flee. Federal prosecutors looked at the mountain of evidence and were sure that the judge would see that Russell was a danger to the public.\n\nBut when U.S. Magistrate Judge Thomas McCoun III presided over the bail hearing, he determined that the bomb-making equipment, the fact that Russell was the self-confessed leader of a white supremacist gang, the inspirational photo of a mass murderer, the testimony of a close friend who said that Russell was planning to kill, the statements from terrorism experts who say that far-right nationalists are a bigger threat than Islamic jihadists, and the Department of Homeland Security report that warns against these groups\u2014all of this, combined\u2014wasn\u2019t enough evidence for him to deny bail to Russell. McCoun said that he did not believe that there was \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d that Russell posed a threat to the community.\n\nBut mostly because he was white.\n\nI do not like when people use the lazy, subjectively speculative prefix of \u201cIf he was black ... \u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut if Russell were a 21-year-old gang leader with a stockpile of weapons and a witness who said that he was planning to commit a crime, we all know what the outcome of the bail hearing would be. Hell\u2014if police caught a black gangbanger with a cooler filled with white powder that turned out to be cocaine, he might never see the light of day again.\n\nBut Russell is white, which affords him the great American option of a second chance. Even though Russell lives in the state where people attack Wendy\u2019s workers with alligators in the drive-thru window, Florida is still in America. And in America, being white trumps everything else, including facts, justice and even public safety.\n\nAnd that must feel amazing.\n\nRead more at NBC News and the Washington Post.", "keywords": ["terroristintraining", "judge", "helluva", "alibi", "bail", "white", "planning", "hearing", "danger", "whiteness", "russell", "evidence", "terrorist", "threat", "frees"], "polarity": 0.07635658533385806, "subjectivity": 0.3988061622720714},

No one. Not even my friends who owned guns. And definitely not those who hunt, and none who otherwise support the Second Amendment. But who could blame them? It didn\u2019t exactly sound welcoming or even remotely wise to go to an NRA convention full of mostly white, conservative, gun-brandishing folks, and where Donald Trump is the keynote speaker.\n\nI went because the NRA is all about telling Americans that guns keep you safe from everything: crime, terrorists and those jack-booted, gun-hating liberal thugs in the government. Which should be right up my alley as a black person. On top of fearing random crime and crazy white vigilantes who shoot us for being black on a sunny day, black people have much more to fear from an aggressive government, in the form of killer cops, than just about anybody else in America. I wanted to see if the NRA was offering a gun for my type of real-world #SayHerName kinds of fears.\n\nOf course, what I discovered is, there\u2019s no gat for that. We are not the target audience for their gun play. Stoking white fear of imaginary terrorists, black thugs and immigrants\u2014and keeping in place the guns and policies that support it\u2014is what the NRA convention is all about.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI went to the convention on Friday; it was held at the Georgia World Congress Center in Atlanta, literally across the street from CNN headquarters. As I walked in with the mostly white, men-of-all-ages crowd, snide comments about \u201cfake news\u201d whizzed past my ears. Once inside, I saw that there were guns everywhere\u2014free guns, guns from raffles, gun-training classes. Gun companies were handing out weapons as if they were T-shirts at a Hawks game. I thought President Barack Obama spent the last eight years taking everyone\u2019s guns away? Maybe they hid these until they were sure he was out of office.\n\nAlmost all the people I talked to at the NRA convention said that they love guns but hate politics. They said that they enjoy and employ their guns safely and just want the government out of their way. Which almost makes sense, given that studies and history show that gun ownership and policy are driven by white racial resentment, not public safety or good government. However, I didn\u2019t want to let things like facts and history deter me. The NRA is one of the largest, most powerful lobbying groups in America. There had to be a place for gun-comfortable or gun-curious black folks like myself in the NRA protection racket, right?\n\nI spoke to Colion Noir about the connection between \u201cgun culture\u201d and racism, and why places like the NRA convention are perceived as being unwelcome for black folks, even those who are comfortable with guns. Noir is a lawyer, a gun advocate, a host on NRA TV, and one of the few black faces I saw on any poster or brochure at the whole convention.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about an issue that has been engrossed in politics. I\u2019m not naive enough to think they [guns, politics, race] don\u2019t crisscross, but I try to separate them. I have to,\u201d Noir said.\n\n\n\nHe talked about how welcome he was at the convention and how many times, \u201cboth sides\u201d refuse to talk to each other about issues relating to guns, race or shootings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI get pulled over all the time because I can\u2019t stop speeding,\u201d he joked. One time, Noir was driving with 10 guns in his car and got pulled over by a \u201credneck cop,\u201d and they ended up having a great 20-minute conversation about gun culture.\n\n\u201cMy experience isn\u2019t everybody\u2019s,\u201d he acknowledged. Which is true\u2014just ask John Crawford, Tamir Rice and Philando Castille, all of them black people shot and killed by police while having real or toy guns, despite being in open-carry states. But according to Noir, these shootings aren\u2019t about institutional racism; they\u2019re about ignorance, gun culture and a few bad cops.\n\nI, along with a 30-something black man listening to our conversation, wasn\u2019t trying to hear Noir\u2019s \u201cGotta hear both sides\u201d rhetoric, so I pushed back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe consequences for white ignorance aren\u2019t the same as for black ignorance,\u201d I said. \u201cWe have a legal system that has repeatedly said white fear, either out of ignorance of racism, is enough justification to employ lethal force, whether you\u2019re a private citizen or a cop. It\u2019s not the same for us.\u201d\n\nNoir, ever the lawyer, agreed that bad cops should be punished, but he quickly went back to arguing that we have to look at every shooting on a case-by-case basis rather than see an overarching problem. Which would work fine, if the entire convention weren\u2019t selling the exact-opposite message.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEverywhere you go in the convention, you\u2019re being told that the world is a dangerous place and you have to be ready. Even at the convention itself. I started up a conversation with a 50-something suburban-looking white guy named \u201cChris.\u201d It was his fourth NRA convention, and we were talking about seeing Donald Trump Jr. walk through the building with not nearly as much security as you\u2019d expect for the son of the 45th president.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Secret Service must be going nuts, right? With all these guns in here?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure Donald Trump Jr. is safe,\u201d I responded. \u201cNobody here wants to take a shot at him. These are all responsible hunters, right?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, I love the NRA, but I couldn\u2019t bring myself to hunt,\u201d Chris said. \u201cMy wife and I have three rescue dogs, and I just couldn\u2019t bring myself to take \u2026 to take an animal\u2019s life, you know? But I\u2019m OK if other people want to hunt.\u201d\n\nWait, what?\n\nDespite Chris\u2019 concerns, the NRA seems much more interested in the dangers posed by ISIS terrorists, illegal Mexican immigrants and \u201curban thugs\u201d than a room full of non-background-checked men with enough weapons to save Morpheus and John Wick in one afternoon. As much as I could find use for a metallic pen that doubles as a glass breaker or a pair of hearing aids so strong I could hear a deer piss on cotton, none of these toys makes me any safer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt one display, a guy was selling an actual Gatling gun. I started thinking about those cable-news gun debates where you always hear the same argument:\n\n\n\nLiberal person: Why do you need an AK-47 to hunt deer?\n\nConservative person: Have you ever seen a deer hopped up on PCP?\n\n(OK, I made that part up; cable networks gave up having actual gun debates years ago.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m thinking, who in the hell needs a Gatling gun? For a second I thought maybe it was just for display, like a sword on the wall or old cannons as lawn decorations. \u201cNope, it\u2019s real; it actually works,\u201d the dealer said.\n\nI\u2019m all in favor of gun ownership, but unless you\u2019re planning on mowing down a group of attacking Zulu warriors, who in his or her right mind needs to drop $47,000 on a functioning Gatling gun? For that much money, I could just buy a nice car and run somebody down in the street.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoreover, do I really want that person as my neighbor? What if he or she confuses a group of brown kids at a pool party with burglars? Let\u2019s not forget that for years the Gatling gun was used by British invaders in Africa because the weapon was deemed too terrifying and brutal to use against Europeans. Selling this weapon is like selling Zyklon B: Yes, it\u2019s technically a pesticide, but we all know the racial history of how it was really used.\n\nThe monetization of the racialized fear at the NRA is perfectly encapsulated in the biggest rollout of the weekend: the NRA\u2019s Carry Guard insurance program. For just $31 a month, when catching these hands isn\u2019t enough, Carry Guard provides legal coverage to individuals who catch a case after shooting someone in \u201cself-defense.\u201d Commercials for Carry Guard are a supercut of horrible crimes, from convenience stores to roadside stops (with mostly white victims), where shooting your way out of it is the only option. The program covers 20 percent of your legal costs up front and anywhere from $150,000 to $1 million in fees if you\u2019re found innocent or the case is dropped.\n\nYou\u2019d think this would be a great program for Juwan Alexander Plummer, the 19-year-old from Detroit who shot two cops last week, fearing that they were burglars. Or, even better, Florida\u2019s Marissa Alexander, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison for firing a warning shot at her abusive husband. Or nah. The NRA isn\u2019t offering plans targeted at black ladies\u2019 fears and safety.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMassad Ayoob, a well-known gun instructor and advocate, says that the trial for George Zimmerman, and men who see themselves in his shoes, drove the market for gun insurance, and the NRA is cashing in. I guess, in theory, this racialized \u201cZimmerman insurance\u201d could be Dick Cheney insurance if you accidentally shot a friend while hunting deer. However, it was pretty clear that the ads were aimed at shooting humans, not some overly aggressive black buck. Assuming that you see the difference. (See what I did right there?)\n\nSo if the NRA isn\u2019t quite offering you the safety protection and training for black folks\u2019 daily fears, who is? Well, there\u2019s the recently formed (2015) National African-American Gun Association, whose membership has skyrocketed since Trump took office. But if you\u2019re looking for something a little more around the way, you might want to call up the services of Maj Toure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToure is the founder of Black Guns Matter, an organization that teaches inner-city youths and families about gun culture, safety and protection. I talked to him after he did an interview with NRA TV in the main room of the convention. Toure knows that the program name is a bit provocative, but he\u2019s trying to make a point.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not in the business of trying to convince someone else that my life matters,\u201d says Toure. \u201cImma reach out to whomever and talk to people. If you\u2019re from an urban area and wanna learn, let\u2019s get it done.\u201d\n\nToure is more concerned with black folks creating safety for themselves, by themselves, since it\u2019s pretty clear that no one else really is. When I asked him how he was treated at his first NRA convention, he was mostly positive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI get tons of support here,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople say some slick shit on social media, but whatever; I have work to do.\u201d\n\nHow convenient. In the end, the NRA convention was not a Ku Klux Klan rally without the hoods; it was something equally disturbing but much less obvious. It was all of the ridiculous, cognitively dissonant ways that race, guns and American policy intersect. A convention where people of color walk around freely buying guns from people who would justify shooting them out of fear in any other space. A world where a relatively pro-gun person like myself doesn\u2019t see my image or my concerns reflected in any commercials or merchandise. A world where gun advocacy means that some lives matter more than others and some don\u2019t matter at all.\n\nIn other words, the NRA convention was a lot like America: at one point familiar, but in so many other ways making it clear that there\u2019s no real space for people who look, sound and live like me.", "keywords": ["trump", "convention", "person", "matter", "white", "day", "guns", "shot", "shooting", "nra", "black", "youre", "age", "gun"], "polarity": 0.07802035506580962, "subjectivity": 0.42995561677379873},

That can\u2019t be right) examined a variety of studies on gun ownership, including a 2017 study by sociologists at Baylor University. Titled \u201cGun Culture in Action,\u201d the researchers created a \u201cgun-empowerment scale\u201d to study the habits and create a profile of the average gun owner.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat they found was startling. (And by \u201cstartling,\u201d I mean it reflected what people like Very Smart Brothas\u2019 Damon Young have been saying all along. So ... not startling.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter studying a representative cross section of gun owners, researchers found that the people who have an emotional attachment to their guns were 78 percent white and 65 percent male. It must be noted that the sample size was small because\u2014despite widespread American gun ownership\u2014just 3 percent of the population owns half the guns in the country.\n\nRacial anxiety was a big reason for the uptick in gun ownership, according to Angela Stroud, a Northland College sociologist. Stroud went through concealed-weapon applications in Texas and interviewed applicants. She found that many of them wanted to protect their loved ones during the impending race war.\n\nApparently, Barack Obama came to the secret black meeting and told black people to attack the whites. (Wait ... you missed the meeting? It was great. Especially the catering. Best watermelon and Kool-Aid I ever tasted.) According to the report:\n\n... Stroud also discovered another motivation: racial anxiety. \u201cA lot of people talked about how important Obama was to get a concealed-carry license: \u2018He\u2019s for free health care, he\u2019s for welfare.\u2019 They were asking, \u2018Whatever happened to hard work?\u201d Obama\u2019s presidency, they feared, would empower minorities to threaten their property and families.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere are some of the more notable characteristics of the typical, emotionally attached gun owner:\n\nThey are less educated: According to Pew Research, about 26 percent of white college graduates own guns, compared with 40 percent of high school graduates and 42 percent of people with some college education. There is no significant difference in the rate of gun ownership across educational attainment among nonwhites.\n\n\n\nAccording to Pew Research, about 26 percent of white college graduates own guns, compared with 40 percent of high school graduates and 42 percent of people with some college education.

Pew Research shows that a larger percentage of blacks have been threatened with a firearm or know someone who has been shot, but white men are more likely to say they need a gun for protection. And while most blacks find gun violence to be a problem in their community, most Republicans say more guns would lead to less crime.\n\nSo there you have it. White men need guns to pretect them from the evil Negro monsters roaming the country. They are stockpiling arms like the zombie apocalypse, despite the fact that white men are three times more likely than blacks to kill themselves with a firearm ...\n\nEven though white men are more likely to be shot by another white person ...\n\nRegardless of the studies that show a gun in the home is also more likely to kill someone in the home than an intruder ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd even though most children who die from gun injuries are killed by a parent, sibling relative or friend ...\n\nIt\u2019s the scary black people they worry about.\n\nThat\u2019s just science.", "keywords": ["men", "ownership", "stockpile", "college", "owners", "white", "afraid", "report", "guns", "study", "theyre", "researchers", "black", "science", "gun"], "polarity": 0.11358363042186571, "subjectivity": 0.4163055163790458},

Since 2015, Twitter has banned more than 125,000 accounts linked to ISIS, or the Islamic State group, The Guardian reports. Both Google and Facebook employ various tools to counter terrorist activities on their platforms. The FBI wants the authority to shut down Islamic extremist sites, and senators recently asked the Federal Communications Commission why it can\u2019t do more to eliminate the online entities that radicalize people over the internet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmid all this hullabaloo, one group is never mentioned. Politicians, law-enforcement agencies and media outlets rarely talk about the American terrorists radicalized on the internet who go out and commit heinous acts. They point out the ones with Muslim names, brown skin and Middle Eastern backgrounds. They single out the \u201cthugs\u201d and \u201cgangbangers,\u201d who, they contend, are seduced by music videos and rap songs, but ignore the growing number of violent extremists who have been brainwashed on social media and popular websites, even though they are responsible for the bulk of domestic acts of terror.\n\nThere is a growing group of radical extremists in this country. They are young. They are impressionable. They are the new breed of homegrown terrorists. They are white, and they will kill you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Nidal Hasan killed 13 people on Fort Hood Army base in Texas in 2009, investigators were already tracking his communications with radical Yemeni cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, whose blog reportedly also inspired at least 10 other terrorist incidents. Under pressure from U.S. officials, the website was eventually taken down by its host, and Awlaki was eventually killed in a targeted drone strike in 2011.\n\nProsecutors say that when Dylann Roof slithered out of Charleston, S.C.\u2019s Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in 2015 after killing nine parishioners at a prayer meeting, he had been self-radicalized by sites like the Council for Conservative Citizens and the Daily Stormer. James Harris Jackson\u2014the man who allegedly prepared for a mass murder of minorities by stabbing a black man in New York City\u2019s Times Square in March\u2014subscribed to several \u201calt-right\u201d YouTube channels, according to the Daily Beast. Sean Urbanski, who is charged with murdering Richard Collins III just days before the Army lieutenant was scheduled to graduate from Bowie State, was a member of at least one white supremacist Facebook group, CNN reports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConservatives would have you believe that there are a large number of Muslims secretly plotting to kill us all, but the numbers don\u2019t show that. If you remove the Sept. 11 attacks from the casualty count, foreign-born terrorists have committed 25 murders in the last 25 years. In fact, the chance of an American being killed by a foreign-born terrorist is 1 in 3,609,709 (pdf), say researchers at the Cato Institute.\n\nBut since 1993, right-wing extremists have been responsible for 255 deaths and have injured more than 600 more. According to a new report by the Anti-Defamation League, the vast majority of these acts of terror have been committed by white supremacists; people who were anti-immigrant, anti-government extremists; or a combination. On Monday the ADL released \u201cA Dark & Constant Rage\u201d (pdf)\u2014a comprehensive report cataloging 150 incidents of right-wing extremism over the past 25 years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, you are seven times more likely to be killed by a right-wing extremist than by a Muslim terrorist. White extremists are far more dangerous than jihadists. Every study shows it. Statistics bear it out. But here\u2019s the problem:\n\nIt is not that no one knows it. They just won\u2019t say it. The FBI knows it. Local law-enforcement agencies worry about it. Media entities are aware. Even the Department of Homeland Security recognizes the threat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut they won\u2019t do or say anything because this brand of terrorist kills black and brown people. Because it is unthinkable to profile young white men as violent thugs, but acceptable when America does it to Muslims, Mexicans and black people.\n\nBecause white privilege.\n\nThe Alt Reich: Nation group that Sean Urbanski visited is still taking members on Facebook. The Daily Stormer, the website that Dylann Roof may have posted on, is still up and running. Just recently, a black student at American University needed police protection after a neo-Nazi site\u2019s founder sent the site\u2019s readers after her. He\u2019s still on Twitter. The Council of Conservative Citizens is open for business. Everything is still cool.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerhaps tomorrow, or next week, another white male will open fire in a crowded theater because of propaganda he read online, as white supremacist John Russell Houser did in July 2015. Maybe next week, a lone wolf will go to a Black Lives Matter protest and empty his gun\u2019s magazine, as Allen Scarsella did in November 2015.\n\nOr next year, someone might walk into another temple and spray bullets the way white nationalist Wade Michael Page did in a Sikh temple in 2012. All three of these men were \u201cradicalized\u201d by groups that exist openly, without any fear of being arrested for fueling violence or making terrorist threats.\n\nOf course, there are some who worry about the \u201cslippery slope\u201d that leads to the government control of free speech. Ask Lt. Collins\u2019 family if his life was worth less than a Facebook group\u2019s existence. Inquire about freedom of speech from the people whose bodies still have bullet fragments from Scarsella\u2019s weapon. Better yet, ask the members of Emanuel AME if they\u2019d trade the right of neo-Nazis to spread hate in exchange for the lives of Cynthia, Susie, Ethel, Depayne, Clementa, Tywanza, Daniel, Sharonda and Myra.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGo ahead ... I\u2019ll wait.\n\nIn 1919, in a unanimous decision by the Supreme Court, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote that even \u201cthe most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theater and causing a panic.\u201d The phrase is meant to explain that there are limits to the First Amendment. When a person\u2019s speech causes harm or injury to someone else, it is reasonable that a society would stop that person.\n\nBut in America, if the person screaming \u201cfire\u201d is white and the theater is filled with black or brown people, he can yell all he wants.", "keywords": ["group", "speech", "white", "extremists", "isis", "quiet", "facebook", "radicalization", "americas", "sites", "killed", "black", "say", "alqaida", "terrorist", "vanilla"], "polarity": 0.004777733604264211, "subjectivity": 0.36083318608828807},

As private citizens in a private organization, we will stand ready to protect our own families and friends, our property, and our liberty from leftist chaos. Moreover, we will be ready to assist our local and State authorities in keeping the peace should they find it necessary to \u201cdeputize\u201d private citizens for that purpose.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t sound ominous at all. What is the \u201cgrowing leftist menace\u201d to historic Christian civilization that it is referring to? What leftist chaos are they protecting their families, friends, property and liberty from? And saying that they are ready to be deputized by law enforcement? The same law enforcement that has already been weaponized against black and brown bodies?\n\nHatewatch says that plans to militarize the league are not new and that in 2014, the group began developing and training a paramilitary unit called the \u201cIndomitables.\u201d The unit was to help advance a second secession, but that effort died out fairly quickly.\n\nThe promise of increased LOS militancy has led to faltering membership in the group, and according to Hatewatch, since Dylann Roof\u2019s massacre of nine black people at Charleston, S.C.\u2019s Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in 2015, there has been a string of high-profile departures from the group.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, none of that has stopped Hill from acting as a military commander, albeit one who has not been able to maintain a clear chain of command or restrain some of the more impulsive league members.

Hill wagered hard on a former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s victory in the 2016 election and has since struggled with the realization that Trump\u2019s rhetoric has sapped support in the Deep South for causes historically championed by the League. Hill\u2019s announcement closes by directing recruits to contact the League using a web form reserved for normal members. \u201cAre you ready to be a man among men?\u201d Hill asks. \u201cJoin the League and its Southern Defense Force today!\u201d The phrase \u201cman among men\u201d is a reference to propaganda posters for the Rhodesian Army during the Rhodesian Bush War, a civil war from 1964-79 in the unrecognized country of Rhodesia that remains a popular reference for white nationalists. The conflict inspired Dylann Roof, who named his blog \u201cThe Last Rhodesian\u201d and posed for pictures on social media with the Confederate Battle Flag while wearing a jacket patched with a Rhodesian flag.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHatewatch says that Hill has echoed the Rhodesian mythos in social media posts and on the LOS website, and he has likened the loss of white dominance and authority in that war to white genocide.\n\nAs Hatewatch notes, Hill is just one voice out of many in an escalating violent rhetoric that is spreading across the South and the United States, and the formation of the Southern Defense Force \u201crepresents a desperate promise of armed resistance from an aging radical on the fringe of a movement he once dominated.\u201d\n\nThese groups are going to continue to form, and our president and his administration are giving them just the voice and platform they need to have a \u201creason\u201d to \u201cfight.\u201d The hyperbolic nature of our president\u2019s speeches and the media bubble that his followers exist in continue to give them the #AlternativeFacts they need to believe that whiteness is under attack and needs to be protected.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, black and brown people just want to survive.\n\nRead more at the SPLC Hatewatch blog.", "keywords": ["men", "ready", "asks", "group", "south", "defense", "hatewatch", "traditionalist", "neoconfederate", "join", "southern", "rhodesian", "league", "leftist", "hill", "force", "vigilante"], "polarity": 0.04576807995925642, "subjectivity": 0.29943340972752736},

She\u2019s a little over 2 years old now, and it seems like every week she does or says something new that I had no idea she knew how to do or say. Yesterday morning, for instance, she noticed me laughing at a text I received, and then said, \u201cYou\u2019re silly, Daddy.\u201d She\u2019s undoubtedly heard the word \u201csilly\u201d before, but knowing it well enough to use it in the proper context is something I wasn\u2019t aware she could do.\n\nMy Facebook timeline today is filled with pictures and videos of school-age children across the country walking out of their schools, leading protests and giving speeches. Some of these images were posted by the proud parents of children participating in #NationalWalkoutDay. And some of these parents expressed joyous surprise at how brave and passionate and articulate their children were.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s not that the parents had low expectations for them. They just have never had the opportunity to see their children like this. And while these are not my children, I felt (and still feel) that same parental pride when watching and reading about these amazing young people. I can see my daughter in these kids, and I\u2019m as proud of and protective of them as I would be with her.\n\nToday is also a goddamn fucking disgrace.\n\nPerhaps, in time, #NationalWalkoutDay will be remembered as a prominent act in a series of acts that forced America to reconsider and change its relationship with guns. But right now, today, all I can think about is how these kids should have been in school. And how the schools they\u2019re in should be safe. But they were not in school because the schools aren\u2019t as safe as they should be. And the schools are not as safe as they should be because America considers its freedom-wrapped fears more important than the well-being of these young people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd because of this, American schoolchildren can now place themselves on the ever expanding list of people forced to live in and clean up the messes white American men continue to make. A list that, of course, includes black people, all women, Mexicans and too many other groups to name.\n\nAs a dad, I can\u2019t wait for my daughter to continue to surprise me.

The nationwide demonstration is being hailed as a groundbreaking act of civil disobedience that seeks to protect the lives of America\u2019s most vulnerable citizens. There is no way anyone could object to something so necessary and relevant.\n\nUnless, of course, black people do it.\n\nThe National School Walkout is a 17-minute planned act of defiance, protest and solidarity meant to spark action and commemorate the lives of 17 students gunned down at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet there be no misunderstanding: Nikolas Cruz is a mass murderer, and the massacre in Parkland was a tragedy. Hopefully this walkout will prompt our elected officials to take a long look at the nation\u2019s gun laws because those students deserve better. Their lives are valuable.\n\nBut not more valuable.\n\nThe game-changing, totally unique idea of the National School Walkout that is gathering attention all around the world is a tactic that has been tried before, to much derision. The people who sought to inspire meaningful change and spark conversation were called disruptive and communists and even castigated as terrorists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen white people started doing it.\n\nIn February 2016, students at Mount Hebron High School in Ellicott City, Md., left campus to highlight racism at their school, to responses like: \u201cStart a conversation? How\u2019s this for an opening line? Stop being professional victims and get your selves back into the school.\u201d\n\nIn Madison, Wis., cops arrested and maced students who walked out of school in protest of the 2015 police killing of Tony Robinson.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, there are some who will say that this has nothing to do with race. The shooting in Parkland is a national story, and that is why people are paying attention to those kids. It\u2019s not because they are white. The stories I just pointed out are lesser-known incidents, proving that people don\u2019t care about the color of the students advocating for change, or even the skin tone of the victims. This is about all lives!\n\nThey are correct.\n\nBut I might be wrong. This may simply be a case of imbalanced media focus. Who\u2019s to say that the Parkland students are receiving more media attention for the walkout because the victims and the activists are mostly white?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is no one in America who doesn\u2019t know about the tragic deaths of those high school students. It is a big, talked-about national news incident. Maybe they are garnering attention and inspiring legislative change simply because they are young and conscious.\n\nOf course, that wouldn\u2019t explain why\u2014unlike with the recently passed gun legislation in Florida\u2014no one bothered to examine the \u201cStand your ground\u201d law after high schoolers all over Florida walked out in protest of Trayvon Martin\u2019s death, which was arguably more widely known. What about the students who walked out in protest of the Mike Brown nonverdict in St. Louis County? That was definitely a bigger story than Parkland.\n\nPerhaps I\u2019m ranting about nothing. You know me, always bringing up race. Or maybe I am cherry-picking isolated incidents. Maybe black kids protesting by walking out of schools was never really a thing and I\u2019m making up stories like these:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can be sure that some anally injured, weak-skinned troll will seek to dismiss this article by posing the ancient Caucasian riddle: \u201cBut what about black-on-black violence? (Which, according to my research, is different from \u201cbutt-hurt.\u201d Anal injuries are real.)\n\nBut anyone in a black community knows that stop-the-violence rallies greatly outnumber Black Lives Matter protests. However, the media refuses to cover those marches with the same rabid fervor. Why the hell would white people even hear about the Chicago elementary school kids who marched against gun violence in their communities in 2017? Or the black and Hispanic high school students in Los Angeles who walked out to protest gang and gun violence? Do they even know about the kids in Sandy Spring, Ga., who held a sit-in at school to protest gun violence? How about the kids at Chicago\u2019s Polaris Academy who organized a \u201cplay outside\u201d day in protest of gang and gun violence almost a year ago?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 17 lives ended in the halls of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High shouldn\u2019t matter any more than the countless ones snuffed out by the drug war, police brutality and\u2014yes, I\u2019ll say it this time\u2014black-on-black crime. You don\u2019t think black kids want to feel safe, too? Contrary to the belief of police officers and \u201cAll Lives Matter\u201d activists, black bodies are not bulletproof.\n\nThis criticism in no way disparages the actions of students across the country protesting gun laws. Ultimately, everyone hopes that the National Student Walkout inspires necessary change. Yet this is simply the latest example of the national double standard placed on the shoulders of black people.\n\nAfter all, black resistance is like rap music; Bo Derek braids cornrows; moving to a Brooklyn, N.Y., neighborhood; and relocating to this great, big land called America: No one ever gives a fuck about it ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUntil white people start doing it.", "keywords": ["school", "lives", "lets", "walkout", "high", "national", "kids", "protest", "happens", "students", "forget", "walk", "black", "save", "gun"], "polarity": 0.0754330065359477, "subjectivity": 0.4435912698412699},

The incident occurred during a course about gun safety.\n\nAccording to KSBW-TV, Dennis Alexander was leading the Administration of Justice class at Seaside High School when his firearm went off at about 1:20 p.m. Alexander was pointing the weapon to the ceiling when it went off, causing pieces of the ceiling to fall to the floor.\n\nThe Seaside Police Department confirmed that while no one suffered \u201cserious injuries,\u201d one 17-year-old boy suffered \u201cmoderate\u201d injuries after fragments from the bullet ricocheted off the ceiling and hit his neck.\n\nAlexander had, in fact, told the class that he wanted to make sure the gun wasn\u2019t loaded when it went off, Fermin Gonzales, the father of the injured teen, told the news station.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the craziest thing. It could have been very bad,\u201d Gonzales said.\n\nWhat was really crazy was that after the gun went off, Alexander apparently apologized and went on doing what he was doing. No one at the school, according to Gonzales, checked to make sure that everyone was OK. So you can imagine how shocked the Gonzales family was when the teen returned home with blood on his shirt and bullet fragments in his neck. His parents had to rush him to the hospital to be examined.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s shaken up, but he\u2019s going to be OK,\u201d Gonzales told KSBW. \u201cI\u2019m just pretty upset that no one told us anything and we had to call the police ourselves to report it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlexander was placed on administrative leave from his teaching position at the high school as well as with the Sand City, Calif., Police Department.\n\n\u201cI have concerns about why he was displaying a loaded firearm in a classroom.

So much so, in fact, that the storyboard artist/comics creator/illustrator drew the electromagnetic teenager from Milestone Media\u2019s multicultural superhero universe every day throughout February 2018. Just don\u2019t call him... clingy.\n\nAs a latter-day character, Static did okay for himself\u2014in addition to a healthy run of comics, the alter ego of Virgil Hawkins starred in the Static Shock cartoon in the early 2000s and was also a featured guest on the animated Justice League shows. A new version of the character showed up on season two of Young Justice and will be part of the team when the series comes back for a much-longed-for season three.\n\nBarrett loves all things Static and decided to draw the character for a month-long project this past February. I asked him about his affinity for Dakota City\u2019s charged-up crimefighter\u2014and for a sampling of his work.\n\n\n\nio9: When did you first encounter Static, in the comics or on TV?\n\n\n\nSamir Barrett: I first encountered Static in the Milestone comics when I was gifted a small stack of the first few issues. That was somewhere around \u201898 or \u201899, I think, not long before the cartoon [came] out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIllustration: Samir Barrett\n\nio9: What was it about Static that made you pick him for this project?\n\n\n\nBarrett: Static\u2019s always been one of my favorite heroes; he\u2019s a cool nerdy black kid with electricity powers and that was always pretty appealing to me. As a kid, pretty much everybody wants to be Spider-Man and I was no different. But, even then, I knew I was no Peter Parker. But, with Virgil Hawkins\u2014who was kind of the black answer to Spider-Man\u2014I felt like I could actually be him. Plus, I thought electricity powers were dope.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019d been wanting to do something like this with the character for a long time, like at least a year, but I couldn\u2019t pull it off last Black History Month so I made sure I was ready for this time.\n\n\n\nImage: Samir Barrett\n\nio9: How did you keep the project from feeling repetitive?\n\nBarrett: It was tough trying to keep the series feeling different and fresh with each image. I was very concerned with it being repetitive because I am essentially drawing the same character over and over again. So, after the first three or four drawings\u2014even though I liked how they turned out\u2014I knew I had to start mixing it up and changing up the poses and colors. Coming up with interesting poses is the hardest part, but I tried to make sure no two poses were the same and tried to implement background and lighting colors other than the ones I was comfortable with. I think some were more successful than others in that regard.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nio9: Do you have a favorite official costume? Or a fan-designed one?\n\n\n\nBarrett: I think many of the official designs are great and all for different reasons, if I had to choose a favorite, it\u2019d have to be the old school comics Static with the big yellow coat. I don\u2019t know why I love that coat so much, but it gives the character a big presence. And, as far as favorite fan designs, it\u2019s a tough call but Ron Wimberly\u2019s design wins out.\n\nImage: Samir Barrett (based on a Ron Wimberly design.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nio9: Is there anything you appreciate more about the character, after having worked professionally in animation?\n\n\n\nBarrett: Yeah, absolutely. As a kid, I always recognized that cartoons were made with a lot of work and a lot of people but it\u2019s hard to fully appreciate it until you participate in it first hand. So, in particular, I have a lot more respect for the show and all of the people that found a way to make it happen. Thinking about it, it\u2019s kind of crazy that Static managed to even get his own show.\n\nImage: Samir Barrett (designed by Jason Reeves)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe was definitely the most popular name in Milestone but, in general, I think he was kind of obscure. The fact that he got his own cartoon hanging out with cats from the Justice League is pretty amazing.

However, the past few years have finally seen some cracks in the proverbial glass ceiling as black culture has permeated into the mainstream of the comic book universe. From Marvel\u2019s reimagining of classic rap album covers as comic book covers to the success of Black Lightning, Luke Cage and what is expected to be a massive bow at the box office for Black Panther, minorities in comic books are no longer a rarity in 2018.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s astounding to consider that it took this long for comic book publishers to recognize the appeal of black characters who are more than just sidekicks and henchmen. But with the buzz for Black Panther and seeing just how much a black character resonated with an audience, the door has been thrust wide open for more black characters who look, talk and act like us to be featured in this medium.\n\n\u201cRepresentation matters. The lack of representation also matters,\u201d comic book writer Bryan Edward Hill explains to The Root. \u201cStories ultimately tie back to mythology, and it\u2019s the way we rationalize good and evil. When you\u2019re not represented in stories, especially when you\u2019re not a protagonist or a hero, and you\u2019re confronted with that over and over again, subconsciously you start to question your own agency in the world.\u201d\n\nThe significance of black children and adults seeing themselves in comic books has long been undervalued by publishers. But with a diverse crop of black heroes (and anti-heroes) cropping up and finding success, films like Black Panther will hopefully become the norm and no longer outliers that we have to celebrate because we\u2019re unsure we\u2019ll ever see something like them again.\n\nHill\u2019s ongoing DC Comics series, Michael Cray, is one that will draw its fair share of attention because of the comic\u2019s unique narrative and the fact that it is written by a black man with a black title character and a black artist providing the visual element.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichael Cray is a fascinating story in which the title character is an assassin who exists in an alternate version of the DC universe and is tasked with hunting down evil versions of DC heroes, which include Arrow, the Flash and Aquaman.\n\n\u201cThe initial concept was pretty broad,\u201d Hill says of the spinoff to DC\u2019s The Wildstorm, by Warren Ellis. \u201c[Ellis] wanted me to tell a story of this guy who is in between masters and found a new organization that wanted him to take out evil versions of DC heroes. I was interested in the idea of not being able to trust your own consciousness and Cray\u2019s background as a guy who has received dogma his entire life. There\u2019s a story of a guy growing in power while simultaneously being a weapon for other people, and how those things come into conflict [is] really interesting.\u201d\n\nHill drew upon his own personal experiences as well as conversations with family and friends who had a military background to mold the personality of Cray.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI try to find real-world experience that I can insert into the work,\u201d he says. \u201cI was able to reach out to some people and get some stories about what it was like to hunt human beings for a living. From that research, I was able to paint a portrait that felt authentic to me. Then I layered it with my own life experience.\u201d\n\nAs for Hill\u2019s journey to this point, it\u2019s certainly been one that is unique in its own right.\n\nWith his father\u2019s untimely death due to cancer when he was 8, Hill desperately needed something to have faith in. After entering a comic book store and coming across a Batman comic that seemed to mirror his emotional weight of losing a parent, the St. Louis native found something to believe in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBruce Wayne was going through everything I was going through, but he was able to take that pain and turn it into something,\u201d Hill recalls. \u201cAs a kid, you are looking for your pathways and trying to figure out what is possible and what is impossible. For me, Batman became an instructive mythology on how to deal with grief, anger and all of those emotions.\u201d\n\nWith St. Louis admittedly not being a fertile ground for breeding African-American writers, Hill grew up enjoying comics but never really considered a career writing comics until later in life.\n\n\u201cI wanted to go into law enforcement,\u201d Hill reveals. \u201cI thought I was going to be an FBI agent, but my mother said, \u2018Nope, you can\u2019t have a gun so pick something else.\u2019 If I couldn\u2019t be an FBI agent, I wanted to tell stories. That led me to writing, and comics were always the most exciting stories you can read. I couldn\u2019t get that experience from any other forum.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter graduating from New York University film school, Hill worked as a freelance journalist before landing his first comic-writing job with Top Cow Productions in 2010. Since then, he\u2019s worked on a number of comics, including Witchblade, Postal and 7 Days From Hell.\n\nHe recognized early on that he was a black writer in a predominantly white space and needed to find a way to balance servicing the needs of readers with introducing characters of color.\n\n\u201cWhen I started writing, I knew that if you were to platform and agenda the task of writing characters of color and center them in fiction, you would have a very difficult path to be a professional,\u201d he says. \u201cEarly on, I would always balance things. There were less opportunities for writers of color and characters of color to be in these stories. This evolution that we\u2019ve had is a great thing. We\u2019re no longer telling a new generation what they can\u2019t do; they are growing up with a more wide-open field of participation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeing at the helm of Michael Cray has been yet another balancing act for the 40-year-old. With a history of black characters being trapped in their own blackness, Hill sought to ensure that Cray was a black man with black experiences, but one who was not defined solely by those encounters.\n\n\u201cI know that as a black man, I don\u2019t wake up every day thinking about being black and filter every experience I have through a prism of race,\u201d Hill says. \u201cBut there tends to be a trend when you have characters of color that is the only thing they think about the entire time, and every conversation is governed by it. It\u2019s just not realistic. A lot of it is well-intentioned and broadens the conversation, but a lot of it left me cold because it doesn\u2019t feel real to me.\u201d\n\nRather than force Michael Cray\u2019s blackness into every conversation he has in the comic, Hill made it a point that while his character is black, it isn\u2019t all that the story is about. After all, Michael Cray is about a man who is hunting down a twisted version of the Flash. The psychology behind that alone is worth dissecting, and Hill manages to do that while making sure the reader is never misled into thinking that Michael Cray is anything but a black man.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe have more dimensions than [just being black],\u201d Hill says while looking toward the future in a post-Black Panther world. \u201cThat is the next evolution of characters of color. Allowing them to escape the gravitational pull of the story being about their race. We have other stories to tell. Being black is an element of the story, but we don\u2019t want to make his story only about that.\u201d", "keywords": ["michael", "color", "comics", "explains", "matter", "flash", "kill", "writing", "comic", "writer", "representation", "black", "book", "hill", "characters", "cray", "edward"], "polarity": 0.05555084426353084, "subjectivity": 0.5093901434386509},

But I no longer believe these things are true ...\n\n\n\nI know they are.\n\n\n\nLast night, while sitting on the couch engaged in a time-honored Friday-night Negro tradition called \u201cchillin\u2019,\u201d I received a text that simply read, \u201cDid you hear about Junie Poonie and that mass shooter?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy heart sank.\n\nI contacted Junie\u2019s sister first, and she sent me the link to the story of how her brother stopped a man who wanted to become the \u201cgreatest mass shooter in history\u201d by filming himself massacring people in a Las Vegas church.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo understand this story, you must first know the hierarchy of the black family tree. There are black people across this country who have blood relatives they don\u2019t know about, including sisters, brothers and sometimes parents. Ranking higher than any DNA-based relationship, though, is the earned honorific of \u201cplay cousin.\u201d A play cousin is a de facto sibling. It is more family member than actual family.\n\nWhen I was growing up, my mother\u2019s best friend had four children. She was as much my aunt as any of my mother\u2019s sisters. Her husband was one of the scant few in-house fathers in my neighborhood, and he was a hulking figure of a man who still calls me \u201cprofessor.\u201d Like my family, they had three girls, and only one of their children was a boy. His name was Heyward Jackson Jr., but in most black neighborhoods, birth names are as malleable as DNA and often give way to nicknames.\n\nWe call him \u201cJunie Poonie.\u201d\n\nAccording to KVVU-TV, on Feb. 21, Heyward Jackon Jr. was attending a church service at his Las Vegas church when he noticed 23-year-old Calin Howard Hodges asleep on a pew. Junie asked Hodges if he needed some help because he looked disheveled. Hodges declined Heyward\u2019s help and told Junie that he was \u201cplanning something big.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJunie began talking to Hodges (and I know Junie; he can charm a space alien from Nebula 5 who only speaks Quooloc into an engaging conversation by making a person think he genuinely cares about their home galaxy and is interested in what they have to say). Hodges began telling Heyward that he was planning to become \u201cthe greatest mass shooter in history,\u201d referenced Stephen Paddock, and, according to the police report, added that he \u201ccompletely identifies with every mass shooter\u201d and \u201csalutes every person who has the balls to do it.\u201d\n\nAnd what did Junie do? He kept talking to the dude and surreptitiously began recording the conversation on his cellphone. About 40 members of the church were shuffled outside and the police were called while Junie kept the man engaged.\n\nWhen the cops arrived, Junie shared his recordings with the officers and they arrested Hodges. \u201cPolice charged Hodges with making threats or conveying false information concerning acts of terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, lethal agents or toxins prohibited,\u201d KVVU-TV reports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolice will not say if Hodges was armed. According to the Las Vegas Review-Journal, he was an adult film actor who had been fired as a Lyft driver.\n\n\n\nNevada has some of the weakest gun laws in the country. Newsweek describes them this way:\n\nNevada law does not require firearms owners to have licenses or register their weapons, nor does it limit the number of firearms an individual posses. Automatic assault weapons and machine guns are also legal in the state as long as they are registered and possessed in adherence to federal law, according to the National Rifle Association.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf this incident seems like someone just rambling to a stranger, when police searched Hodges\u2019 car, they found a diary saying, \u201cStephen Paddock stole my idea on 1 October.\u201d \u201c1 October\u201d is a reference to the day Stephen Paddock killed 58 people at a country music concert in Las Vegas.\n\nCalin Hodges\u2019 planned mass execution was also reminiscent of Dylann Roof, who shot up Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C.\u2014the state where Junie and I grew up\u2014killing nine parishioners during a Wednesday-night Bible study.\n\nHeyward thwarted Hodges\u2019 copycat crime on Feb. 21\u2014at Mountain Top Faith Ministries\u2019 Wednesday-night Bible study.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJunie and I grew up like brothers along with another one of our friends, James Bond (no, that\u2019s not a nickname; James\u2019 nickname is 007, or \u201cDouble-O\u201d), who lived on the same street. The three of us were the rare few guys in our entire neighborhood to escape our surroundings and go to college. I somehow managed to get an academic scholarship. Double-O went into the Army and then to college. Junie attended college on a football scholarship and later moved to Las Vegas to play semipro football.\n\n\n\nThey were the cool guys. I was the nerd. They were both charismatic and athletic. I was the nerd. Our families attended the same church. We teased each other\u2019s sisters. We ate at each other\u2019s table. Junie was younger than us, but he was never afraid of shit, maybe because he was crazy. Or maybe because he\u2019s been built like a brick shithouse since he was about 8.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur only disagreement in life was when Junie informed me and Double-O that he was pledging Kappa. I\u2019m still disappointed in him for that. But he\u2019s still my play cousin. Plus, I\u2019ve never seen Junie shimmy.\n\nWhen I spoke to Junie, he told me he was definitely \u201cshook,\u201d but told me he couldn\u2019t reveal the details publicly because prosecutors had issued a gag order on the case. He also said that he thinks people need to hear the audio recordings so the public can know the kinds of people who have access to guns.\n\nWe rarely talk much these days, and to be honest, it\u2019s my fault. Whenever we have a conversation, it\u2019s because he occasionally reaches out to me to talk about something random. He now lives in Vegas and I live in Alabama, so we don\u2019t even get to see each other\u2019s families.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the last few years, we have seen each other a couple of times. His nephew was in a car accident a few miles from my home last year, and I made sure Junie\u2019s sister, mother and father were well-fed when they were in town. He called me when he was getting married, and we got the chance to hang out last summer. We were both in town on business, so we didn\u2019t spend a long time together.\n\nThe FBI reports that of the 104 active-shooter events between 2000 and 2012, 17 were stopped by potential victims. In 14 of those situations, the shooting was stopped by someone who was unarmed and managed to talk to the person or subdue the shooter with no weapon.\n\nOnly three active shooters were stopped by a good guy with a gun.\n\nI know Heyward Jackson Jr. and cannot imagine him being erased from the earth by a psychopath. Even worse, I can\u2019t fathom that someone would become a celebrity by killing my play cousin and lifelong friend. He is a father. He is a husband.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJunie Poonie is a good guy.\n\nHe did not have a gun.", "keywords": ["guys", "know", "shooter", "good", "las", "church", "disproved", "stopped", "myth", "guns", "cousin", "shooting", "play", "vegas", "junie", "hodges", "mass"], "polarity": 0.0872320768662232, "subjectivity": 0.46316298877274487},

A young black woman narrating. References to Fannie Lou Hamer and Harriet Tubman. Mentions of SZA and Solange. Testosterone might power Black Lightning, the superhero, but a healthy dose of estrogen helps drive Black Lightning, the series.\n\nIn the series, based on the DC Comic launched in 1977, actor Cress Williams (who\u2019s been paying dues as far back as Scooter on Living Single and Lavon Hayes on Hart of Dixie) plays Jefferson Pierce, a hometown Olympic-gold-medal hero-turned-do-gooder principal at Garfield High and community leader, forced to secretly crusade as Black Lightning. Forced because the father of two daughters\u2014high schooler Jennifer (China Anne McClain) and medical student Anissa (Nafessa Williams)\u2014still pines for their mother, Lynn (Christine Adams, Agent Weaver from Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.).\n\nUnable to handle the painful physical demands and the emotional toll on Jeff (broken bones, bloody wounds), Lynn made it painfully clear that there would be no \u201cwe\u201d with Black Lightning around, eventually divorcing Jeff. And though he suppressed his superhero alter ego, opting to \u201csave more lives as a principal,\u201d she has yet to relent.\n\nHowever, that doesn\u2019t stop Jeff\u2019s eyes from burning with desire for only her (even though there is at least one woman waiting in the wings to happily scoop him up). Because, ultimately, he\u2019s \u201cjust a man who wants his woman back,\u201d he desperately wants to let go of Black Lightning, especially since there is clearly still love on Lynn\u2019s part, too\u2014if only she would allow herself to go there. But despite Jeff\u2019s best intentions, the streets keep calling and derailing their reunion. Since his heart also bleeds for his girls, he will do whatever it takes to keep them safe, even if it means resurrecting Black Lightning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Jeff\u2019s daughters are no damsels in distress. Instead, they are formidable forces in their own right: Jennifer is \u201ca standout scholar-athlete, just like her father,\u201d while Anissa chips in as a health educator. Both are intelligent and strong-willed free thinkers steeped in black history\u2014and \u201cherstory.\u201d While Jennifer is in the throes of teenage rebellion, Anissa goes #BlackLivesMatter hard for social justice. And though their father doesn\u2019t hesitate to protect them, Black Lightning shows that these young women are more than capable of handling themselves. In fact, their strength foreshadows the superhero gifts that surely await them.\n\nStill, some challenges are too big to fight alone. When the rebellious Jennifer entangles herself with local gang the 100, putting both herself and her sister in danger, their father is left with few options to save them. But Black Lightning soon discovers that he can\u2019t just use his gift to save his own and walk away; his entire community is in danger, and just putting in work at Garfield High isn\u2019t going to change that. However, his necessary heroics don\u2019t dim the community\u2019s female voices and concerns.\n\nOne of the more interesting developments in Black Lightning is that the 100\u2019s reign of terror very much includes the sexual violation and exploitation of young black women. Sex trafficking is actually tagged as one of their most egregious crimes here, while most crime stories in urban communities\u2014fictional as well as real-life depictions\u2014overlook the high price that black girls and women pay with their bodies and lives. It\u2019s a grim reality to address in a world that often acts as if black womanhood is expendable and black girlhood is nonexistent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEqually refreshing, black female sexuality isn\u2019t just a straight affair. Through elder daughter Anissa, queer black women are represented and acknowledged. Though this is also true of the comic book series, television is notorious for not following the rules.\n\nBut Anissa\u2019s sexuality is not just significant to the superhero genre; queer black women are typically ignored in all stories, even in LGBTQ-focused ones\u2014and especially in black ones. If they are depicted at all, as in the recent She\u2019s Gotta Have It, it\u2019s more fetishistic than real. Even as black gay men become more regular fixtures in television, demanding at least obligatory representation in contemporary black stories like Insecure, black gay women remain invisible\u2014or seemingly unicorns, like in Survivor\u2019s Remorse. So Black Lightning\u2019s inclusion is a key departure.\n\nBlack Lightning seizes every opportunity to show that black women are very much an organic part of the black community, far beyond the classroom and the church. From the TV news anchor to the cop at the police station to the senator speaking at the school fundraiser, black women are well-represented here. And they aren\u2019t cookie-cutter in appearance, either\u2014not even in hairstyles. Jennifer wears her hair straight and long and Anissa is loose and curly, while their mother, Lynn, is close-cropped. And as a bonus, the women featured are overwhelming chocolate sisters. So clearly the Kerry Washingtons, Issa Raes and Rutina Wesleys are making strong impressions on showrunners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen it comes to how we are represented on the small screen, screenwriter and producer Mara Brock Akil just keeps raising the bar. From Girlfriends to Being Mary Jane\u2014with a little of The Game in between\u2014she has been a key catalyst for projecting images of the contemporary black woman on TV. That she\u2019s been able to accomplish this largely by creating and collaborating with her husband, Salim Akil, is even more impressive. Salim Akil might well be the driving force behind bringing Black Lightning to TV, but the execution clearly demonstrates that he and his wife balance each other out.\n\nEven in the male-dominated superhero genre, the Akils have managed to adapt 1970s idealism to the harsh realities of now, without forcing black women to the background, while staying true to the comics\u2019 black-family spirit.

We are the ones who consciously and subconsciously modify our voices and our behavior when forced to interact with them. We\u2019re the ones whom trained officers with weapons and badges and handcuffs and legal justifications are so damn scared of that we\u2019ve created entire curricula based on that fear, teaching ourselves what to do to seem less frightening to them. This fear is why they\u2019re so obsessed with arming themselves with multiple human killing machines. It\u2019s why they fight against even the notion of incremental disarmament so vehemently. They are scared shitless of us. Of anyone who is not them. And this fear is why our shitty gun laws exist, and it\u2019s why they will continue to.\n\nNaturally, there was some pushback from people who don\u2019t believe that fear\u2014specifically, fear possessed by white conservatives\u2014is what\u2019s driving our gun control problem. And some of their points and arguments were so compelling that I considered reconsidering.\n\nBut nah.\n\nFrom the Washington Post:\n\nKeeping ourselves and our loved ones safe from harm is perhaps our strongest human motivation, deeply embedded in our very DNA. It is so deep and important that it influences much of what we think and do, maybe more than we might expect. For example, over a decade now of research in political psychology consistently shows that how physically threatened or fearful a person feels is a key factor \u2014 although clearly not the only one \u2014 in whether he or she holds conservative or liberal attitudes. Conservatives, it turns out, react more strongly to physical threat than liberals do. In fact, their greater concern with physical safety seems to be determined early in life: In one University of California study, the more fear a 4-year-old showed in a laboratory situation, the more conservative his or her political attitudes were found to be 20 years later.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHmm.\n\nWith this in mind, John Bargh (the author of this piece) and three of his colleagues (Jaime Napier, Julie Huang and Andy Vonasch) conducted an experiment in which they turned conservatives into liberals by simply asking the conservatives to pretend that they weren\u2019t controlled by fear.\n\nBut before they answered the survey questions, we had them engage in an intense imagination exercise. They were asked to close their eyes and richly imagine being visited by a genie who granted them a superpower. For half of our participants, this superpower was to be able to fly, under one\u2019s own power. For the other half, it was to be completely physically safe, invulnerable to any harm.\n\nIf they had just imagined being able to fly, their responses to the social attitude survey showed the usual clear difference between Republicans and Democrats \u2014 the former endorsed more conservative positions on social issues and were also more resistant to social change in general. But if they had instead just imagined being completely physically safe, the Republicans became significantly more liberal \u2014 their positions on social attitudes were much more like the Democratic respondents. And on the issue of social change in general, the Republicans\u2019 attitudes were now indistinguishable from the Democrats.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBasically, if we could somehow find a way to convince conservatives not to be so fucking scared of every damn thing, they\u2019d be better people.\n\nThis seems like a daunting task. Perhaps even impossible. But if they were able to convince themselves that we\u2019re subhuman superpredators, it shouldn\u2019t be too hard to convince them that they\u2019re Black Panther.", "keywords": ["republicans", "social", "act", "safe", "terrifies", "attitudes", "fear", "ones", "scared", "experiment", "theyre", "little", "baby", "way", "physically", "proves", "snowflakes", "conservatives"], "polarity": 0.11385949441505, "subjectivity": 0.45019106407995285},

Here\u2019s the press release:\n\nToday, DC announces Oscar-winning screenwriter John Ridley (12 Years a Slave, Let It Fall) will examine the DC mythology with a compelling new literary comics miniseries, THE OTHER HISTORY OF THE DC UNIVERSE. The story will analyze iconic DC moments and chart sociopolitical gains through the perspectives of DC Super Heroes who come from traditionally disenfranchised groups, including John Stewart, Extra\u00f1o, Vixen, Supergirl, Katana and Rene Montoya among others. At its core, the series focuses on the lives of those behind the costumes, and their endeavors to overcome real-world issues. \u201cI could not be more excited by the opportunity to excavate the canon of the DC Universe through a vast array of characters who\u2019ve earned their seat at the table,\u201d explains Ridley. \u201cI\u2019m very impressed with DC\u2019s commitment to making their history as reverent and urgent as it is engaging and entertaining for all its many fans.\u201d THE OTHER HISTORY OF THE DC UNIVERSE isn\u2019t about saving the world, it\u2019s about having the strength to simply be who you are.

I thought we were going to do an explainer yesterday, but you seem so distracted. What\u2019s going on?\n\nI\u2019m sorry. I was keeping an eye on Florida\u2019s House of Representatives all day. House members passed a school-safety/gun control bill and sent it to the governor for his signature.\n\nThat\u2019s great! Maybe they\u2019ve finally seen the light and can pass legislation that will put a stop to all these mass shootings!\n\nI hear you, but this bill will probably mean more dead black kids.\n\nWait ... but you just said it\u2019s a gun control and school-safety law. By definition, that means it will control guns and make schools safe, right?\n\nThis is Florida, man. You can buy a boa constrictor at a convenience store in Florida. Don\u2019t forget, the 9/11 hijackers took flying lessons in Florida and it didn\u2019t raise any red flags when they told their instructor, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about the landing part.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNothing in Florida makes any sense.\n\nThe Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act raises the minimum age to buy a weapon to 18, allows citizens to \u201cred flag\u201d people with mental health problems and enacts a three-day waiting period on most weapons, all of which are needed. But it does nothing to curb the sale of military-style weapons. It does not close loopholes regarding purchasing guns at gun shows or in private sales.\n\nBut even more troubling than the previously mentioned exemptions, the new law creates a program that will result in armed school employees.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy is that a bad thing? You know what they say: The only person who can stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.\n\nFirst of all, almost every legitimate study shows that when more guns are present, more people die. A 2015 study of FBI and national crime by the Violence Policy Center (pdf) concluded that people are more likely to cause an accidental death than prevent a crime when pulling a gun in self-defense. The Washington Post reports that for every justifiable homicide using a gun, there are 34 criminal homicides, 78 gun suicides and two accidental deaths. A 2013 study by the FBI (pdf) even shows that more active shooters are stopped by unarmed citizens.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, no one ever says that thing about \u201cbad guys with guns being stopped by good guys with guns.\u201d It\u2019s a National Rifle Association marketing slogan. But then again, I\u2019ve also never seen anyone eating a Chicken McNugget while muttering the catchphrase, \u201cI\u2019m lovin\u2019 it!\u201d\n\nBut you said black kids will die. How do you figure that?\n\nBecause I trust these little-known, seldom-used things called \u201cfacts.\u201d\n\nFor instance, a study by Ohio State University revealed that black students receive harsher punishments than white kids for the same relatively minor infractions. Federal data shows that teachers and schools are four times more likely to suspend black students. Research by the American Psychological Association shows that even away from school, people with darker skin are perceived as bigger, stronger and more threatening than white people the same size.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo whom do you think gun-toting school employees are more likely to shoot?\n\nBlack kids. But I\u2019ve read a little about this legislation. It proposes training, mental health evaluations and drug screenings. Wouldn\u2019t that help?\n\nHas training, drug screenings and mental health evaluations stopped police from killing black people disproportionately?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGood point. But what about the fact that they could go to jail for shooting the wrong kid? You\u2019ve gotta admit that the law wouldn\u2019t shield anyone from prosecution.\n\nHow is that different from any other self-protection legislation like Florida\u2019s \u201cStand your ground\u201d law? In a \u201cStand your ground\u201d study that looked solely at cases in Florida, researchers discovered that between 2005 and 2013, Florida juries were twice as likely to convict the perpetrator of a crime against a white person as they were to convict in a crime against a person of color.\n\n\u201cThese results are similar to pre-civil-rights-era statistics, with strict enforcement for crimes when the victim was white and less-rigorous enforcement with the victim is nonwhite,\u201d the report said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you give anyone the legal authority to shoot people, they are always going to shoot black people.\n\nDamn. So if this data is readily available, why would they consider such a stupid law?\n\nBecause Florida legislators don\u2019t care about dead bodies as much as they care about the buckets of cash from the NRA. It\u2019s why the homicide rate has surged 22 percent since the state passed the \u201cStand your ground\u201d law. It\u2019s why Sen. Marco Rubio stood in front of a Parkland, Fla., shooting survivor and explained his loyalty to the NRA by explaining that \u201cpeople buy into\u201d his agenda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo black students are in a lot of danger, huh?\n\nIt\u2019s not just the students. It\u2019s the black school employees, too. The Florida law doesn\u2019t arm classroom teachers, but it allows all of the other school workers to carry weapons if their school district opts in. Traditionally, black people carrying concealed weapons haven\u2019t fared so well, even if the gun is legal.\n\nIn fact, I read a story a couple of years ago about a black school employee who carried a legal firearm. He was a lunchroom worker. He was stopped by the cops, and he informed the officer that he was licensed to carry. I think his name was Philando Castile.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can\u2019t recall how that situation ended up, but I\u2019m sure everything turned out OK.\n\nUmmm ... I think you should go back and ... you know what? Never mind. Look, I know it\u2019s Florida, but come on man. It couldn\u2019t be that bad. Maybe you\u2019re wrong about how dangerous this could turn out to be.\n\nPerhaps. After all, there\u2019s no way the state of Florida would allow an adult to shoot an innocent black kid and get away with it. Especially if the kid wasn\u2019t involved in any kind of crime or threatening the life of anyone around him. That would be incredibly racist. Maybe I\u2019m just overreacting. I probably should call someone who would know better.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWould you happen to have a phone number for George Zimmerman?", "keywords": ["school", "crime", "florida", "means", "white", "shows", "guns", "study", "law", "explained", "teachers", "students", "dead", "black", "armed", "gun"], "polarity": 0.0388758116883117, "subjectivity": 0.46734356210918687},

I just hope magical Negroes love chorizo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo, you don\u2019t remember that at all? Well, it was from a piece I wrote last year on the statue of Stephen Foster that sits in Pittsburgh (between two world-renowned universities, the Carnegie Museum of Art and the main branch of the Carnegie Library) and also happens to be the most racist statue in America.\n\nOf course, calling something the \u201cmost\u201d of anything is quite the honor, and the \u201cmost racist\u201d anything in America has quite a bit of competition.

I know you\u2019re going to see it anyway, but here\u2019s what you\u2019re setting yourself up for.\n\n\n\nThe plot of Justice League is perfectly serviceable: Batman (Ben Affleck) forms a team of heroes he\u2019s been hinting at for three movies to stop an alien invasion. The problem is with everything else. We\u2019re now five movies into the DC Comics universe (Man of Steel, Suicide Squad, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and Wonder Woman), and none of these films have a firm handle on who these characters really are. When you bring them all together, it\u2019s like awkward speed dating more than team building.\n\nIs Cyborg (he and his dad are apparently the only speaking black people in the DC Universe) a brooding internet Frankenstein or is he the \u201cbooyah\u201d-loving kid from Teen Titans Go? Is Ezra Miller\u2019s Flash the anxious kid haunted by his dad\u2019s imprisonment or is he the quirky Ross-from-Friends, Jesse Eisenberg-in-every-movie trope, forcing \u201ccomedy relief\u201d down our throats? And Bat-fleck? The guy who is supposedly obsessed with bringing the team together but has given every indication that he wants out of the franchise? I\u2019m not saying he phoned in his performance, but his effort was about as consistent as T-Mobile on the subway.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs little as the characters are actually together in movie time (maybe two days tops), it\u2019s hard to see any camaraderie. Mind you, this is a superhero movie, not Moonlight\u2014as long as the action is good and it\u2019s visually appealing, it should be salvageable, right? Unfortunately, the action scenes and character designs are lousy, too, and suffer from a serious case of doing too much.\n\nThe problem starts with Flash (who is never actually called that name in the movie) and permeates the entire film. Between Quicksilver in X-Men: Days of Future Past and Quicksilver in Avengers: Age of Ultron, Hollywood has produced some really fascinating effects for showing superspeedsters. Justice League muddles everything about the Flash by only showing his powers in slow motion and constantly circling him in electricity, and he seldom interacts with anything that\u2019s not CGI.\n\nIn Justice League\u2019s first battle as a \u201cteam,\u201d there is a tepid attempt to re-create parts of the incredible shootout scene from X-Men: Days of Future Past (right up to running along the walls). However, in Justice League, someone decided that it\u2019s more fun to blur the entire background, slow everything down and make it almost impossible to contrast Flash\u2019s speed with the world around him. You should never be watching an action sequence with the Flash and think to yourself, \u201cWill he just hurry up?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead of giving Cyborg (Ray Fisher) a RoboCop physique that is a mixture of flesh and machine, Justice League designs him like a first-generation Cylon from Battlestar Galactica, complete with a lack of genitals or flesh (which adds some interesting racial subtext to the furtive glances between Cyborg and Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot). (Have to make sure the tin black man with the genius IQ and the athletic background will never have sex!)\n\nDespite being crucial to the plot, Cyborg is the only Justice Leaguer who can\u2019t consistently control his powers, and when he does, it looks clunky. Two of the three big fight scenes in Justice League occur in dark places or with a rusted red-and-orange background, which gives the film\u2019s big set pieces a lack of depth and a drab feeling. You\u2019ll see the contrast in these poor cinematic choices at work in Batman\u2019s dark and confusing opening fight with a CGI Parademon, compared with Wonder Woman\u2019s amazing takedown of some actual real-life bank robbers. (Wonder Woman\u2019s opening is the second-best action sequence in any DC movie behind Man of Steel\u2019s superhuman fight in Smallville.)\n\nFinally, maybe somebody at Warner Bros. has stock in black pixel footage, or maybe somebody in production has a weird obsession with hentai, but this is the third DC movie (Man of Steel, Suicide Squad and now Justice League) in which some large black tentacle thing has to be defeated in order to save the world. It\u2019s getting kind of weird.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWas there anything to like about Justice League? A little. There is a semibig surprise near the middle of the movie with a really fun action scene and fight that hasn\u2019t been spoiled by trailers. The whole setup could\u2019ve been a game changer had it lasted longer and the chemistry between characters been better. Aquaman doing his best Khal Drogo/Wolverine impression by running around shirtless seemed to impress a few people in the audience.\n\nThere were a few witty lines of dialogue, but you\u2019ve seen most of the punchlines in the trailers, so they weren\u2019t as funny in the movie. The movie sets up the Flash and Aquaman for their own films (but not Cyborg), so if the movie is a huge success, those spinoff films will be coming for fans. There are a few references to other DC superheroes that may appear down the line if the movie is successful enough. Honestly, though, the way Justice League ends, there isn\u2019t any real indication as to why this group would need to team up again except for another cash grab, no matter what the two post-credit scenes try to hint at.\n\nIf you have to see something before Thanksgiving weekend, I suspect you could drag yourself to see this movie, but I would recommend Justice League for \u201cRedbox and chill.\u201d That way you won\u2019t be mad about the $2 you spent.", "keywords": ["trash", "grab", "going", "desperate", "justice", "movie", "flash", "league", "black", "team", "dc", "wonder", "money", "action", "youre", "cyborg"], "polarity": 0.04552579365079365, "subjectivity": 0.4982953042328042},

However, in recent days, students Josh Gallagher and Connor Dietrich are refuting that narrative, both expressing disgust toward Gard on Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Twitter, Gallagher wrote that Gard \u201ccalled himself a hero, and ... the media portrayed him as a hero when in reality he is the opposite.\u201d\n\nGallagher said that he was in Gard\u2019s class when the fire alarm went off and students started filing out. Then they heard gunshots, and about 15 of them stopped in their tracks before running back toward the classroom. At that point, however, Gard locked the door and refused to let them back in, Gallagher said.\n\n\u201cWe were stuck in the hall for four total minutes, ducking and in fear for our lives,\u201d Gallagher wrote. He said that another teacher eventually let him and the other students into another classroom, but the teen said that Gard \u201cleft 75% of his students out in the hallway to be slaughtered.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGard, for his part, did a phone interview with CBS Miami while he and some of the students were still sheltered in his classroom, less than two hours after the shooting, awaiting the all-clear from police.\n\nGallagher pointed out that the teacher had been interviewed by multiple media outlets as a hero.\n\n\u201cHe is nothing but a coward,\u201d Gallagher said. \u201cHe has revictimized the students he left out of his class by calling himself a hero.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDietrich, who was one of the kids left in the hallway, told a similar story.\n\n\u201cAs one of the kids left in the hallway I want people to understand how terrifying and defenseless I personally felt,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cThe person I had to rely on left us to die and that\u2019s not okay.\u201d\n\nGard, meanwhile, said that he was just following protocol that mandated all doors be kept locked during an active-shooter drill or real-life emergency. He told the Sun-Sentinel that he was surprised that a student and his father were upset after the fact.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI looked back down the hall and no one was around\u2014no one,\u201d Gard said, acknowledging that 13 students had lagged behind and had wound up being locked out. \u201cYou have to close the door. That\u2019s protocol. We have no choice.\u201d\n\nGard said that he and the students who had gotten into the classroom were huddled in the dark by the desk when they heard loud banging on the door. He said that by the time he walked over to the door (an action he said was also prohibited), the banging had stopped.\n\n\u201cFast-forward to Sunday, when the parents came back for an open house,\u201d he added. \u201cAll of a sudden, this kid comes over and starts screaming at me. Then his father started screaming at me.

I\u2019ve always known that there\u2019s a statue where that statue is. But I\u2019ve never actually, like, looked at it.

(For the record, I\u2019m so giddy about what you\u2019re about to read that I wish I could somehow forget that I read it just so I can experience reading it for the first time again, too.)\n\nIt\u2019s not yet clear what will happen to the statue of Foster, composer of \u201cOh, Susanna,\u201d \u201cCamptown Races\u201d and musical numbers for a slew of blackface minstrels. The statue depicts Foster (who was white) looking regal above a banjo-playing black man in tattered clothing. The statue, which sits near the University of Pittsburgh campus on Forbes Avenue in Oakland, was commissioned in 1900 by a local newspaper editor who imagined Foster, \u201ccatching the inspiration for his melodies from the fingers of an old darkey reclining at his feet strumming negro airs upon an old banjo,\u201d per a 2010 City Paper article.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdnubffbucndunikfdbyuker!!!!

Maybe you know that the Oscar-winning writer/producer behind those works also scripts comics, too. Last week at San Diego Comic-Con, John Ridley talked about why.\n\n\n\nRidley was at Comic-Con, at least in part, to talk up The American Way: Those Above and Those Below, a miniseries just kicked off by DC Comics. It\u2019s a sequel to a 2006 miniseries that centered on how the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s impacted a government-sponsored superhero program. Ridley\u2019s work often harbors an unflinching focus on how racial politics complicate individual lives and social histories, and both American Way series explore how that complication would become even greater for people who are superpowered symbols.\n\nI spoke with Ridley in the Hard Rock Hotel in downtown San Diego. Comic-Con fills up just about everywhere with loud, raucous revelry and Ridley offered to take a walk with me to find a quieter place to talk. The chaos was everywhere, though, so he just wound up holding my phone close to his face and mine to make sure we were both heard. Here\u2019s what we talked about.\n\n\n\nThe Origins for Story and Creator\n\nThe American Way happens in its own pocket universe. I asked Ridley about the origination of the first series, and the kind of impulses he was trying to work out in this fiction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJohn Ridley: Part of it just came from my love of comic books. I was a kid growing up, we\u2019d be reading them\u2014they were fantastic. I mean that literally and figuratively. That space where what writers and artists could do was absolutely amazing. I was a younger man in the mid-\u201880s when I think there was a real shift in the quality and the auteurship. Obviously Watchmen and The Dark Knight Returns, but in particular The Question series by Dennis O\u2019Neil and Denys Cowan. I just thought it was amazing, the grayness of it all. The fact that it was meant to be\u2014just from irony\u2014 The Question is not about answers. It was just this guy out there, struggling. And I thought it was absolutely amazing.\n\nBut as a younger man, too, I remember when Black Lightning showed up. And I didn\u2019t read a lot of Marvel as a kid so I didn\u2019t see a lot of heroes of color that had pre-existed, so in the DC Universe, that was a big deal. John Stewart was around and he was always terrific. But it was always weird having the black replacement hero. So, for me, there were those elements of the quality of storytelling, the impact of just comic books in general, but also just what it was like for me when a hero of color arrived.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI wanted to combine all those thoughts and feelings into a story. I\u2019ve always loved history. And I\u2019ve always loved history because there was a certain resolve. You know, part of\u2014obviously\u2014science fiction/fantasy is about being speculative about tomorrow, about possibilities. Where history is about examining the things that did happen in certain realities.\n\nAnd there was a story from history that I was aware of. Where Lyndon Johnson had gone to Kennedy and said, \u201cLook\u2014our biggest issues are not the Cubans or Russia\u2014it\u2019s race relations. It\u2019s integration.\u201d And when we see people being exceptional\u2014there are always going to be deniers\u2014but it makes it that much harder to deny. What if one of the astronauts was a black man? And what would that mean? And showing him working with and for the best and the brightest. So, ironically, Kennedy was like, \u201cYeah, that ain\u2019t going to happen.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I thought that was an interesting departure point, that like the space program\u2014which had very real-world applications\u2014was also a bit agitprop. A lot of it was, \u201cWe\u2019re going to the moon to show how great we are as Americans.\u201d What if they did that with superheroes? Where a lot of it was certainly real, but part of what their mandate for existence was simply to make Americans feel good about themselves. And what if, in this new administration\u2014new being the Kennedy administration\u2014they said, \u201cYou know what we gotta do? We gotta bring in a black hero.\u201d\n\nSo that\u2019s where we began. A love of comic books, a love of history, a moment for me, when I was able to pick up a comic and go, \u201cOh, this is more specific in its representation.\u201d But also to make sure the story was fantastic. And I don\u2019t just mean a good read, but that when you read comic books, the art, the thru all of it, everything that is happening, the buyer deserves to have something that\u2019s fantastic.\n\n\n\nThe Times, They Are A-Changin\u2019\n\nThe American Way: Those Above and Those Below follows members of the Civil Defense Corps after the government-sponsored superteam is dissolved. They\u2019re trying to find some purpose in normal life but their status as larger-than-life figures makes that hard, especially during a time of socio-political upheaval.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nio9: In this new series, you\u2019re acting in an analogous timeline where the hope and optimism of the Space Race era curdled after Martin Luther King was assassinated. In the real world, people started violently venting their frustrations in American cities. You have the same kind of things happening in this series, even though it\u2019s set in the \u201870s, correct?\n\n\n\nRidley: Yeah, the second series is set 10 years later [in] 1972. But you\u2019re absolutely correct; the beginning of the 1960s was nothing but optimism. The middle to later part of the 1960s was certainly a lot of agitation, but with the hope that MLK\u2019s passive, non-violent resistance would show people there\u2019s a better way. By the end of the \u201860s and in the \u201870s, there was just a cynicism and a disregard. Even though the Vietnam War was winding down, and even though there were some gains in civil rights, there were a lot of people who said, \u201cIt\u2019s not enough,\u201d and \u201cThe peace movement does not work,\u201d thinking we\u2019ve got to fight it out. So that\u2019s where we see these primary characters of Jason Fisher, Amber Headen, and Missy Deveroux. They\u2019re in these three different spaces, but dealing with the realities of the world where the optimism they were part of is stripped away, and you\u2019re left with nothing but cynicism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nio9: It\u2019s funny, because black superhero characters used to be locked into either a ghettofied, blaxploitation mode or a concept where they need to \u201crise above\u201d that, which is an inherently racist notion in and of itself. How are you going to tackle that tension within this series?\n\nRidley: It\u2019s difficult, because, unfortunately, when we tell these stories, even in 2017, characters who are black or Hispanic, or Muslim or another orientation, they\u2019re still rather singular. They stand in for the whole population. So there are absolutely elements, and I don\u2019t want to talk about any particular hero that\u2019s out there, but, there are moments where I go, \u201cWhy does he have to be that guy?\u201d\n\n\n\nBut you realize there\u2019s not an opportunity for there to be 15, 20, 25 of them, but the ones that achieve some cultural density still are fairly singular. So what we want to try to do is\u2014with regard to representations of different aspects of different thought\u2014is hopefully say, \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to be any one thing to all people, we hope within this story that we embrace the complex nature.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd I think in the first issue, you can see between Jason and Evan, where Jason\u2019s going, \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d I\u2019m trying to do this. I\u2019m trying to do that. I\u2019m not necessarily trying to do this. And Evan is going, \u201cYeah, but you\u2019re still trying to make the world into your vision.\u201d So with that, you gotta take what comes with it.\n\nOn another space, we see Missy dealing with someone, in comparison, was progressive 10 years ago\u2014and I think we see a lot of that right now. People who may have voted one way in the last election go, \u201cWell, I gave that a chance and what did I get?\u201d It kind of boggles the mind. And then with Amber, someone who\u2019s just completely\u2014\u201cHey, you know what? Optimism doesn\u2019t work. Hope doesn\u2019t work. I need to go out and I need to bring the pain!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo what I think you\u2019re getting at is its\u2014trust me, [I\u2019ve] done it in many spaces\u2014it is very difficult to avoid people who come with an agenda in place. Jason is a black man, he\u2019s going to get compared to this black character or that one. but it is one of those things that as a storyteller, I can\u2019t help what people bring to it. I can hope what they bring away from it is more than what they thought initially, coming to the story.\n\nCrisis on Opposite Earths\n\nAdvertisement\n\nio9: You\u2019re publishing under DC now. How would the characters in this pocket universe of yours react to the characters of the mainline DC universe? Let\u2019s say Jason runs into Black Lightning, or Superman, or Batman;. How would that go down?\n\n\n\nRidley: First of all, I wish you were in charge of DC, for even bringing that up. It\u2019s interesting because I remember when Milestone had these crossover events, just that sense of\u201cThese folks are not distilled concepts of people of color, these are people of color speaking for themselves.\u201d And now they\u2019re going to a space where it\u2019s amazingly progressive and people are doing everything they can but the reaction was still like, \u201cHeeey, whoaaa...\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nio9: One of my favorites comics of all time is Icon #16, that\u2019s the one where Icon and Superman meet. And Icon is obviously a Superman analogue, right? Alien crashes on Earth... lands in a plantation in the 19th Century instead of a farm in 20th-Century Kansas. It was Dwayne [McDuffie] talking about white privilege before it was even a term, and essentially saying \u201cYou had the same journey but you get to be Superman because you look this way.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRidley: Your passport is already stamped. And mine never will be. To me, there would be very similar issues, whether it\u2019s Jason facing off against whoever\u2019s a bit more of a street-level hero, or whether Amber goes after Supergirl: \u201cYou\u2019ve got all the powers in the universe and you\u2019re still playing dress up!\u201d Or Missy saying to people, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to placate. There\u2019s nothing wrong with being proud of being white, it\u2019s not anti-black.\u201d\n\nTo me, to have characters who can say that in a very fundamental way, I think that\u2019s the big thing. A lot of people say, \u201cIt must be great\u201d\u2014and it is\u2014\u201dto be able to write a character like Jason.\u201d But it\u2019s equally great to write a character like Missy, and say, \u201cWell I\u2019m going to put this through my filter now...\u201d And here\u2019s how, to me, this character would represent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Lost Cause\n\nWhen DC Comics offered the opportunity to talk to Ridley, I knew I\u2019d have to ask him about Confederate, since the screenwriter\u2019s work has dealt with the transatlantic slave trade and written science fiction.\n\n\n\nio9: The things you said about speculative fiction have me wondering about your reaction to Confederate, the new show that got announced from the Game of Thrones producers. There\u2019s already been some pushback because they\u2019re dealing with an alternate universe where the Civil War ended one way\u2014there was a successful succession\u2014and slavery still exists. Would you mind giving me your thoughts?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRidley: [pauses for a long beat] Well, the preamble and the caveat is that I work in the space, I know some of these people, and I have to be genuinely diplomatic in what I say. Look, I never hope it\u2019s a litmus test in who can say what, who can write what kind of stories. I\u2019ve also told stories that have taken place in the American slave era, prior to the Civil Rights movement. But I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t say that I think that these folks\u2014if this is what they choose to tell a story about\u2014they\u2019re really going to have to rise to the occasion.\n\nI don\u2019t want to say that somehow people of color own every Civil Rights or slave story, or it can be told [only] one way. Again, I\u2019ve visited that time space so I can\u2019t say you shouldn\u2019t do it. But when you look at the lack of overall representation, to say that \u201cThis is what we\u2019re going to speculate about\u201d is a charged thing to say.\n\nKnowing that all of us have blind spots in terms of our storytelling, I think the makeup of the individuals who are going to be telling that story is important. Exceptional latitude is going to need to be given to other people to make sure there are other emotions that come through that are correct. I didn\u2019t live in 1849 when 12 Years a Slave was set, but I was working as someone who struggled to make sure that document was left behind. So I\u2019ve been on both sides of it. I get it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I also understand the personal amount of research or pain or baggage that I carry with me when we do things like Guerilla or American Crime, or whatever. So I look forward to all the people involved proving that they have the time, capacity, patience, to tell a story that surprises\u2014put that in bold and italics\u2014surprises all of us. I didn\u2019t come up with this idea, but if they\u2019re going to tell that story, then I look forward to being able to tell a story where there was no slavery, or where people of color were in charge.\n\nio9: Those stories exist, as with Steven Barnes\u2019 Lion\u2019s Blood books. I wonder if the green light would happen as easily with those adaptations\u2026.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRidley: That would be part of my thing. You know, I\u2019ve been blessed. I don\u2019t want to make this about me or the things I want to do, but, there\u2019s still that struggle for people of color to say, \u201cWhat about this?\u201d or, \u201cHow about that?\u201d And those sorts of works don\u2019t get the blessing of \u201cDo it! Go with that.\u201d\n\n\n\nA Question in Search of an Answer\n\nSteering the conversation back to comics, I asked Ridley if there were any characters in the DC Comics canon he\u2019d like to write.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRidley: I\u2019m very excited to see Black Lightning coming to television. Very excited to see Cyborg in Justice League. Very excited to see what his spinoff movie is going to be like. You know, in the DC Universe, those were the guys who arrived on the scene when I was just at that age, and I feel like they\u2019ve grown up in interesting ways. I\u2019d love to see Mr. Terrific. I love what he\u2019s about. I\u2019d love to see Vixen. I would love to see a...\n\n\n\nio9: She\u2019s right there waiting for someone to champion. She\u2019s been on some of the TV shows. But the story potential for her is so great; she\u2019s a supermodel with fantastic animal powers...\n\n\n\nRidley: Just everything about her. Not just in the writing; I can\u2019t help but think, \u201cWho would you cast as that part?\u201d At this moment, that\u2019s a character that needs to be a priority, as DC is sort of plotting out their movie universe. If it were me, the question is who are the easter eggs you want in that Cyborg movie? Mr. Terrific? You don\u2019t say a word about it, and when the movie comes out you say, \u201cOh, shit, is that Mr. Terrific?\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe one other character I already said I love: The Question. Why the Question does not have\u2014and I know I\u2019m saying something now that somebody else is going to repurpose and I\u2019ll lose out\u2014why the Question doesn\u2019t have a film is beyond me. I would do a Question film in a heartbeat.\n\n\n\nio9: I wrote an article about that specific run, which I also love. I identified with that character a lot because he wasn\u2019t perfect. Vic Sage was didn\u2019t do anything right.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nRidley: In the first issue, he gets his arm broken, shot in the head, dropped in the river...and you\u2019re the hero.\n\n\n\nio9: And at the end of 36 issues, he gets airlifted out of the city he was trying to save. Because he just couldn\u2019t do it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRidley: It\u2019s a great, great run.\n\n\n\n...why the Question doesn\u2019t have a film is beyond me. I would do a Question film in a heartbeat.\n\nio9: We don\u2019t think about failure enough in superhero fiction. What does it mean when you don\u2019t win? And I think that would be a great thing to explore in an adaptation. Plus, his visual? A guy with no face? Come on.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRidley: I started out in a noir space when I was writing, and just that look \u2014 that alienation and obsession. He\u2019s obsessed with fixing his city, but he\u2019s alienated from it in every way, shape, and form. It was just a great, great, run. And I think the only unfortunate thing was that it comes out of the same space as Watchmen and Dark Knight. Like now, say you\u2019re doing a great series in the Game of Thrones era, it doesn\u2019t matter what you do, you\u2019ve got this other machine that just sucks all the air out. But it\u2019s one of the truly great series in the history of comic books.\n\nAdapting the Work of a Science Fiction Master\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile we talked, Ridley mentioned Needle in a Timestack, the science fiction movie that he\u2019s working on in its early stages, based on a short story by Robert Silverberg.\n\n\n\nRidley: So, it\u2019s a Robert Silverberg short story\u2014very short story. But, like the best science fiction, it is less about the science and more about the possibilities, and more about the very question of \u201cWhat if time travel\u2014like really good science, the way people are on their iPhones now\u2014is just part of our lives?\u201d And if time travel was really part of our life, it\u2019d still in a space [where] the rich have it, like with private jets. It\u2019s aspirational and you kind of got to put up with it, if you don\u2019t have it. What if?\n\nWhat does love mean? What do relationships mean? What is the timeless nature of love? Is it better to love a lot and know it\u2019s going to be short? Or is it better to fight for a relationship that\u2019s going to go for a long time? But in that fighting, you never get to appreciate your partner and who you\u2019re with. It\u2019s an amazing story. It\u2019s a very beautiful story. It\u2019s one that, frankly, I\u2019ve been chasing for maybe twenty years. I mean really chasing, because I didn\u2019t own the underlying rights, and I finally got the opportunity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf I was going to say something to your readers, perseverance matters. And people say, \u201cWow, it\u2019s really great that you get to do these things.\u201d I\u2019m fortunate because I\u2019ve had a lot of really great people supporting me, but I have to say, more than anything else, just being dogged about the things I believe in, and Needle in a Timestack is one of those things. I can\u2019t wait. We\u2019re putting it together now and I can\u2019t wait to start shooting and bring it to an audience. I also think it\u2019s a little different in that, obviously, I\u2019ve worked with a lot of very politicized pieces. It\u2019s not an accident. I\u2019m very happy for it. But it is nice to look at the different space and work in a film that is going to be colorblind, but race-aware.\n\nWhat we\u2019re trying to put together\u2014to follow up about what we talked about earlier, the \u201cWhy does it have to be like that?\u201d\u2014this is one where it\u2019s just going to be people struggling with something that\u2019s extraordinary, but see those extraordinary struggles about love and life and relationship reflected in more of a world that we live in.\n\nio9: It\u2019s interesting because some of what you\u2019re saying is the same reaction I had to the Wrinkle in Time trailer. \u201cOf course Oprah Winfrey could be a cosmic force in the universe.\u201d She\u2019s a cosmic force in this universe. And you can have these characters \u2014 the \u201cWise Woman Archetype\u201d who don\u2019t have to look like a suburban mom from the 1950s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRidley: We also have people of color who are marginalized into that magical part, or that sidekick part. The great thing about watching that trailer is you go, \u201cThis really looks like the world that we live in.\u201d But rendered in a big, inviting way. So, we want to do the same thing with Needle in a Time Stack. To take very fundamental stories that are often told from the POV of the prevailing culture, and say, \u201cNo, these are relevant stories\u201d for any culture. For any one.\n\nio9: It\u2019s funny. I watched the new Planet of the Apes movie... it reminds [me] of black freedom struggles throughout history. But at the same time, I was heartened, because that\u2019s a universal story. You know? It\u2019s not like we were the first people in slavery, or the first people to fight for civil rights, but it\u2019s a universal story. So I felt it was good to have that response because it reminds me of the work that people all around the world did to become free. It\u2019s now something that people can use to inspire other kinds of stories, and that\u2019s inherently a good thing.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRidley: Well, it\u2019s interesting to me, because, you look at Planet of the Apes and where it really originated, back in the \u201860s, and what it\u2019s about is ultimately\u2014and I want to be very careful, because I\u2019m talking about the ideology of the story, not the iconography of things that are happening in it\u2014but it\u2019s the story of the prevailing culture losing their power. And you have this other group over here saying, \u201cHey, you know what? We just want to live. We just want to go on. But we\u2019re in ascension right now and you need to learn to deal with us. They say peace over and over again, we\u2019ve got a waning culture going, \u2018Well, we can\u2019t accept that. And we\u2019ll fight you to the death.\u2019\n\nI think that is very interesting, because, to me\u2014and by the way Rod Serling co-wrote the film version of the original Planet of the Apes\u2014to me, that\u2019s what it was about. \u201cYou bastards, you changed everything\u201d There are levels there: a different group tearing down these icons that you built up but it was you actually destroyed this stuff; we\u2019re just picking up the pieces. And I think that\u2019s always very, very powerful. I\u2019ve not seen the new film yet. Clearly it is very powerful and well rendered in terms of how people are receiving it. But imagine if that were people of color, and we\u2019ve just taken over, and we\u2019ve got no issue, we\u2019re just living in peace over here. The repsonse would be something like, \u201cYeah, we can\u2019t accept that.

Black power had faded, to be replaced by Afro Sheen. This was the period when Stevie Wonder, Aretha Franklin, Marvin Gaye, Isaac Hayes, and Earth, Wind & Fire were pushing the boundaries of spirit, social reality and sound; when black folks had briefly tried out the term \u201cAfro-American\u201d (presumably a historical echo of Malcolm X\u2019s suggestion?) and everybody was, indeed, kung fu fighting.\n\nMuhammad Ali was already a superhero in the black community, long before DC Comics thought up the crazy idea of pairing him with Supes. I remember watching his fights, post-mortem, on the ABC Wide World of Sports broadcasts. (They aired on network television sometimes live, but sometimes after the fact because cable television was still a technology being tested. Often, the only way you could see a live Ali fight in the rabbit-ears, five-channel era and not be in the arena was via something called \u201cclosed-circuit television,\u201d where you would have to go a theater and pay to see the broadcast via satellite. Closed-circuit television was the analog to pay-per-view.) These weekend ABC network broadcasts, sometimes narrated by Ali and ABC sportscaster Howard Cosell, were how those of us in Any Ghetto, U.S.A., got to see many Ali fights for free.\n\nMeanwhile (a favorite transition word in superhero land), I loved comics, then and now. In 1978 Mom bought me this huge 10-by-14-inch comic (known as a \u201cTreasury edition\u201d) called Superman vs. Muhammad Ali. It was a massive 78 pages, and thanks to the top-talent team-up of penciler Neal Adams and inker Dick Giordano, it had the greatest artwork I had ever seen. (Dennis O\u2019Neil, the writer responsible for making Batman cool after the 1960s television series, worked on the story with Adams.)\n\nFor a moment\u2014just one\u2014I put aside the greatness of Marvel Comics\u2019 creators Stan Lee, Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko and devoured the story. Plot: an green alien race\u2014called the Scrubb, believe it or not!\u2014challenged Earth\u2019s mightiest warrior, Ali, to a fight, or its space armada would destroy the Earth! Superman intervenes, saying that he should fight the alien instead. When Ali balks at this, the Scrubb demand that the two duke it out (under a red sun that neutralizes Superman\u2019s powers) as a preliminary match to the main event.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAli trains Superman at the Fortress of Solitude and then, in a massive arena packed with beings from different galaxies (and a universewide television audience), kicks the Man of Steel\u2019s white, red and blue ass! Then the champ takes on the alien, who looks like a cross between, well, the Hulk and Hulk Hogan, and wins! Super black power, baby! Power to the people! The Earth was saved by the Greatest in the universe, in fact and fiction!\n\nBy 1978, the conflict between Ali and Malcolm X\u2014the latter then a black-counterculture dangerous radical, not the human rights martyr/American postage stamp he\u2019s viewed as now\u2014had faded in the African-American mind. America was now in 2-D: desegregation and disco. And Ali, whom white America had considered a dangerous, unpatriotic \u201cBlack Muslim\u201d (Nation of Islam) racist just a decade ago, had publicly proved himself on many levels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe United States had stripped Ali of his world heavyweight boxing title and tried to put him in jail because of his conscientious objection to the Vietnam War. But \u201cthe People\u2019s Champion\u201d fought back and won. Ali had beaten George Foreman in Zaire in 1974, regaining his heavyweight championship title against all odds. America respects character, perseverance and, above all else, the ability to win. Black comic book historian Adilifu Nama writes that the superhero comic was an important marker in the ongoing image makeover that Ali, now an orthodox Muslim, was undergoing with the American public. As he stood side by side with Superman, Ali\u2019s attitude, name and religion had officially been accepted.\n\nThe irony of this comic book is that when it came out, Ali had just lost the heavyweight title (a point that Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man, by the way, did not fail to point out). Out of nowhere, some nobody from the Olympics named Leon Spinks had beaten him and become the champion! So a tired, aging Ali had to come back, and did. Three times a champion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Ali-Superman wraparound cover has its own history. The audience is packed with 1970s celebrities and DC\u2019s superhero comic book characters, from Lucille Ball to Michael Jackson and his brothers to Lex Luthor and Batman. (The inside cover even had a code so you could see who was there.) Adams did an homage cover for ESPN: The Magazine with Ali vs. Michael Jordan, for Athlete of the Century, in 2000.\n\nThis hokey story is considered by comic book geeks of a certain age either one of the worst or one of the best\u2014or both?\u2014comics made in the 20th century. But either way, it was a unique treasure and is forever, like its hero.\n\nTodd Steven Burroughs, an independent researcher and writer based in Newark, N.J., is the author of Son-Shine on Cracked Sidewalks, an audiobook on Amiri Baraka and Ras Baraka through the eyes of the 2014 Newark mayoral campaign.

Your activism has already impacted this country and will likely save lives. When I saw that Walmart announced that it would allow only people age 21 or over to purchase firearms, I was flabbergasted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have to admit that I initially doubted how effective your efforts could be in the war against Murder Incorporated the National Rifle Association, mostly because I think NRA Executive Vice President and CEO Wayne LaPierre is actually a demon-possessed hobgoblin inhabiting the body of an incubus tucked inside a human exoskeleton that survives by devouring the souls of bullet-riddled babies, so I figured you\u2019d lose the stare-down because ... well ... I don\u2019t think Satan blinks.\n\nI figured, if a Newtown, Conn., elementary school full of dead babies didn\u2019t defeat the NRA, then no one could. But I was wrong! In my naivete, I forgot that the power of whiteness is the only thing more powerful than wheelbarrows full of cash that politicians like Sen. Marco Rubio are willing to accept in exchange for the corpses of high school sophomores. You\u2019re actually changing the world!\n\nBut now that it looks as if you are on the path to success, I\u2019d like for you to continue your efforts. Since it seems like America is much more willing to listen with an open mind when white kids say things, I have a list of five things we\u2019d like for you to put on your agenda when you\u2019re finished with the gun laws.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am authorized to offer you an unprecedented lifetime invitation to the cookout, excluding the annual celebration in Wakanda (I\u2019m sure you understand: T\u2019Challa issued an executive order that\u2019s essentially a white-people travel ban), if you are able to accomplish all five of these goals:\n\n1. Remember how black America acted after the Parkland, Fla., massacre.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to steal your thunder because ultimately, your cause will help black people, just as we believe that our fight against state violence and police brutality will also impact white communities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut did you notice that black America didn\u2019t dismiss your efforts by asking about white-on-white crime? Could you ask your fellow Caucasians to note how\u2014every time someone mentions gun violence\u2014we don\u2019t bring up Parkland? Or Columbine, Colo.? Or Las Vegas? Or Sutherland Springs, Texas?\n\nCould they at least jot down how, whether we agreed with you or not, we simply addressed the specific issue instead of deflecting?\n\n2. Instead of Glocks, can we get some other stuff?\n\nIf they plan on addressing the gun control issue by arming teachers, we, of the black delegation, will pass on the offer. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s a bad idea. But when you look at black communities and the number of kids who have already died from gunfire, the fact that some teachers might have mental issues, the fact that some cops won\u2019t go into a school with a mass shooter but we expect teachers to do so, and the weirdness of my 11th-grade civics teacher, Mr. Heisman ... OK, maybe I am calling it a bad idea.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA really terrible idea.\n\nBut since black schools receive less funding than predominantly white schools, we\u2019ll take some books. A nice handgun costs about the same as an inexpensive laptop, and black students suffer from a gap in access to technology, so we\u2019ll take the laptops instead of the firearms.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering how this will make the world a better place, just think how lit Black Twitter will be!\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. If you can force companies to change their gun policies, maybe you can force them to change other things.\n\nI was amazed that you convinced Walmart to change its policy on gun sales. In your next meeting, could you tell them to change their policy on how many cashiers they have working at one time? I\u2019ve been in Walmart on Christmas Eve and they still didn\u2019t have a cashier at every register, which might be worse than Republicans ignoring the fact that guns kill more Americans every year than AIDS, terrorists, \u201cblack identity extremists\u201d and Shariah combined.\n\nDelta eliminated its NRA discount but still charges $30 to put my bag under the plane, yet it lets me stuff the bag in an overhead bin for free. It\u2019s on the same plane! How is this not illegal? And, like Wally World, airports never have a full staff of Transportation Security Administration agents. Half the check-in lines are never used!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s clear that America needs some commonsense line-control legislation.\n\n4. As long as we\u2019re working on fixing laws that kill people, we have a list:\n\nmarijuana prohibition\n\n\n\ncops being prosecuted by people who are essentially co-workers\n\nmandatory minimums\n\nstop-and-frisk laws\n\npharmaceutical-industry loopholes\n\ngerrymandering legislation\n\nfelon disenfranchisement\n\nFDA legislation that allows white people to make potato salad\n\ncapital punishment\n\n5. Can you never say \u201cAll lives matter\u201d ever again?\n\nAgain, I applaud your efforts, and would never try to denigrate the terrific work you have been doing. Ultimately, we are all on the same side: the not-getting-shot-in-the-face side.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I\u2019d like to point out that black and brown activists have been asking for these same proposals for years. We have spoken about the ease of buying weapons, about the lack of commonsense gun laws and how they disproportionately affect black and brown communities.\n\nEven when white America talks about black people\u2019s need to focus on \u201cblack-on-black crime\u201d before we are allowed to address any issue slightly adjacent to racism, it never raises the prospect of confronting the terrorist organization known as the NRA. It never attributes the gun violence in Chicago to lack of mental health care or access to firearms.\n\nIt is obvious that dead black children like Hadiya Pendleton, who are gunned down on inner-city streets, are not worth as much as their white counterparts who die in suburban schools. But when white America reflexively responds to \u201cBlack lives matter\u201d with that bullshit about \u201call lives,\u201d could you point back to your laudable efforts and explain how the outrage over white lives changed the national conversation, the policies of international corporations and possibly the stranglehold of the most powerful lobbying group in America?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile it might be true that all lives matter, this country\u2019s response to the loss of black lives has never been this vehemently loud and effective.\n\nNot like this.\n\nNever like this.\n\nP.S. While we understand that all of the victims and the activists werent exclusively white, we all know why the country is listening.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou do, too.", "keywords": ["lives", "dear", "white", "activists", "things", "walmart", "control", "youre", "ask", "america", "efforts", "nra", "change", "black", "teen", "gun"], "polarity": 0.030929592959295947, "subjectivity": 0.43710042432814694},

To be a black man is to learn how to make yourself small at an early age. It is to constantly crumple yourself up into something ... anything smaller and less threatening. It is to bridle your tongue and stifle your intelligence. Any black man who says he has never done it is a liar.\n\nOr dead.\n\nTo be a black woman is to exist where you are always told to be quiet while always being told how loud you are. To have volume or confidence equated with bitterness or belligerence. To clothe and carry the entire planet on your shoulder, and to not even be allowed to grunt, lest you be laden with the title of \u201cangry.\u201d\n\nBut most of all, to be black in America is to embrace acceptance. Acceptance of the fact that\u2014even when you are home\u2014you are never home. There is no such thing as home for you. There is no such thing as safety for you. Even when you are home, you are not safe. Or free. Or anything. Just black.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd that is life.\n\nToday, The Atlantic published an article by conservative writer David French about the culture of gun ownership. It is a thoughtful piece on how he first came to experience being a gun owner (when a man who seems to be a stalker showed up at French\u2019s house and the school that French\u2019s children attended).\n\nWhy I Carry a Gun I'm left with the burning conviction that my family and community are safer and freer because\u2026 Read more Read\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe writer goes on to explain how guns make him feel safer in his home. How he felt the first time he fired his weapon at a range. How he obtained a permit to carry his weapon around with him at all times. French wrapped up his foray into becoming a \u201cgun guy\u201d this way:\n\nAt the end of this process, your life has changed for the better. Your community has expanded to include people you truly like, who\u2019ve perhaps helped you through a tough time in your life, and you treasure these relationships. You feel a sense of burning conviction that you, your family, and your community are safer and freer because you own and carry a gun.\n\nThere was nothing inherently conservative or offensive about his argument. It was relatably rational. His attempt to explain the other side of gun ownership was reasonable, except for one part:\n\nThe part where people die.\n\nIn fact, if every gun proposal being argued about right now passed tomorrow, David French could build a time machine, buy some Apple stock for me (I mean ... he\u2019s already going, right?), go back to the moment he decided to purchase a firearm and do it all again. French didn\u2019t buy an assault weapon. He\u2019s over 21. He\u2019s not mentally disturbed. He doesn\u2019t mention anything about owning an extended clip or a bump stock.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, his entire argument in defense of gun owners who are opposed to commonsense gun reform is, \u201cBut we like it, so ... \u201d\n\nAnd after all, isn\u2019t that essentially what privilege is and always has been? On the great American balance scale, even the feelings of white men are worth more than the lives of anyone else. David French deserves to feel safe. David French deserves his security. Don\u2019t mess with his culture. You couldn\u2019t even understand.\n\nEven if it kills someone else.\n\nI\u2019ve always wondered how it must feel to live in a world where I was endowed with the expectation that the planet should bend to my will. I\u2019d love to believe that my principled stance that affects my life in no way whatsoever is more important than not having a ninth-grader\u2019s brains splattered in language arts class. His parents worry, too. But privileged, unreasonable gun nuts and David French say: \u201cFuck them! I\u2019d rather see babies die than have to wait three days for a background check. I want my killing machine now!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUltimately, neither the article nor French\u2019s stance is surprising. They don\u2019t even anger me because I have known many men, black and white, who have tucked their piece of mind into holsters, waistbands or the smalls of their backs, whether legally or illegally. But his entire defense rests on the premise that we simply cannot understand how gun owners\u2019 belief in their own bravery and courage could prevent mass shooters. \u201cThe formula is simple: Criminals and the dangerously mentally ill make our nation more violent,\u201d French writes. \u201cLaw-abiding gun owners save and protect lives.\u201d\n\nLet us be clear: That is a lie. Almost every study ever done shows that the more guns present\u2014legal or illegal\u2014the more unsafe people actually are. But you know ... it\u2019s his \u201cculture.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd the ironic part is that I, too, am a gun owner. I also believe in the Second Amendment. Like French, I want to protect myself and my family. But unlike French, I am not willing to do so at the expense of the lives of others.\n\nI often wonder what it\u2019s like to feel that safe. To believe that you have a right\u2014not just to be safe\u2014but to feel safe. To be cradled by the world as it stomps on the skull of anyone who opposes you.\n\nTo feel at home. To not have to live in the constant duality of being perceived as a threat and always being threatened. To not have to instinctively calculate a slower walking cadence when you encounter white women in dark parking lots so they won\u2019t feel as if you\u2019re following them. To not feel the \u201ctha-dump\u201d in your heartbeat when you see flashing lights in the rearview mirror as a cop follows you\u2014even when you\u2019ve done nothing wrong. To not be folded. To not be crumpled. To be straight.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be the danger but never safe. Never home. ... Never feeling like that must be the ultimate privilege.\n\nBut then again, I am a black man ...\n\nAn apology.", "keywords": ["atlantic", "article", "feel", "french", "white", "sentient", "love", "safe", "man", "carry", "weapon", "privilege", "sweet", "black", "culture", "david", "gun"], "polarity": 0.06059433621933622, "subjectivity": 0.4263154761904762},

Speaking on the floor during the session, Florida state Sen. Oscar Braynon told the room that \u201cthe talk\u201d he gave his young boys would have to be updated.\n\n\n\nBefore, the talk on how to behave around armed authority figures centered on cops. Now it would include teachers.\n\n\u201cIt bothers me to think, as a father of two young boys, to tell them to not be aggressive to your teacher,\u201d Braynon said, according to the Sun-Sentinel. \u201cPlease don\u2019t make it dangerous for children who look like my children to go to school.\u201d\n\nHis colleagues in the Florida state Senate didn\u2019t seem to be listening.\n\nA half-dozen Democratic amendments for gun reform were voted down at the Florida Legislature on Monday, including the reform most sought-after by Parkland, Fla., student activists: a ban on all assault weapons. Instead, lawmakers approved proposals that included raising the age limit on firearm sales from 18 to 21, banning the sale of bump stocks and enacting the Florida sheriff\u2019s Marshal Program, which would allow educators to carry firearms in school.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Sun-Sentinel outlines the particulars of the controversial program:\n\nThose who elect to participate in the program would have to go through 132 hours of training after a background check, psychological exam and drug screening. Both a school district superintendent and a county sheriff can prevent anyone from participating in the program for any reason.\ufeff\n\n\n\nMany have spoken out against arming educators for the inherent safety risks it poses, especially in armed-shooter situations. On Twitter, Charlotte Clymer compiled a thread of reactions from concerned gun owners and war veterans about the proposed law:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe thread included an excerpt from a New York Times article featuring former Marine sniper and author of the memoir Jarhead, Anthony Swofford.\n\nCalling any proposal to arm teachers \u201cabsurd,\u201d Swofford imagined a scenario in which a high school coach with a handgun would have to face down a student armed with an assault rifle:\n\nMore likely ... he would not have been able to draw his weapon (a side arm, presumably) quickly enough to stop the shooter, who with an an AR-15 would have had the coach outgunned. Even if the coach had been able to draw his weapon\u2014from where? his athletic shorts?\u2014any shots he managed to fire would have risked being errant, possibly injuring or killing additional students. As some studies have shown, even police officers have missed their targets more than 50 percent of the time. In firing a weapon, [the coach] would have only added to the carnage and confusion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut as Jamelle Bouie noted in a recent Slate article, school shootings are still, thankfully, a relatively rare phenomenon. What is not rare\u2014and what has been quantified in myriad ways throughout the years\u2014is racial bias in classrooms. And as Sen. Braynon implied, the Marshal Program, by introducing guns into environments where students of color are disciplined at disturbingly disproportionate rates, is much more likely to harm students than it is to save lives.\n\nAs Bouie wrote, black, Latinx and Native American students are most likely to face harsh in-school discipline, despite not being any more likely to misbehave than their white counterparts. Bouie includes a number of data points to back this up, including this striking example: a 2011 study that found that 32 percent of black students were suspended for a first-time offense of using a cellphone at school. Their white peers were suspended at a rate of 15 percent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAt all ages, black and Latino children are viewed as more dangerous and unruly, regardless of actual behavior,\u201d Bouie wrote\u2014and in reading this passage, it\u2019s difficult not to recall the image of a school police officer pulling a black girl from her desk and slamming her to the ground. From teachers to administrators to law enforcement officers, schools have not hesitated to dole out the most severe punishments to students of color.\n\nAnd now firearms may be an option.\n\nThis is perhaps the most disturbing fact: There is no age at which students of color are truly protected. Yale research suggests that racial bias exists among preschool teachers. In one study conducted by the university, preschool teachers were asked to watch video clips of children in classrooms and scan for \u201cchallenging behavior.\u201d The jig? None of the clips contained challenging behaviors. Nevertheless, researchers found that the teachers, scanning for signs of trouble, spent more time looking at black children than white children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe group they spent the most time watching? Black boys.\n\nIt isn\u2019t difficult to imagine what could happen in a high school classroom when an armed teacher, however \u201cwell-intentioned,\u201d anticipates challenging or dangerous behavior from a black student. For that matter, how do we expect our students to behave knowing that their teachers are armed? (And having worked in a school, I can promise you, students will find out which teachers are.)\n\nThe proposed bill in Florida also allows school district superintendents and county sheriffs to bar educators from participating in the program, thus introducing another entry point for an individual\u2019s implicit bias to determine which teachers and administrators get approved and which don\u2019t. It is hard to imagine a scenario in which black educators are approved to be armed at the same rate as their white peers.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut even if that were equal, there remains the final paradox: The educators rushing to get approved to bring firearms to school are the ones who have no business around your children. Ashley Nicole Black, a writer for Full Frontal with Samantha Bee, put it succinctly in one tweet:\n\n\n\n\u201cAll I can picture is every racist teacher who lashed out at me verbally or physically over the years and what would have happened if that person had a gun?\u201d Black wrote. \u201cYeah, there are more good, kind, teachers... but they\u2019re not gonna be the ones signing up for guns.\u201d", "keywords": ["dangerous", "school", "schools", "florida", "educators", "program", "forward", "especially", "approved", "legislature", "students", "teachers", "children", "black", "moving", "laws", "armed", "gun"], "polarity": 0.07754769921436586, "subjectivity": 0.5443712254823364},

Sure, there might be a few bad apples, but the fact that police officers stop, arrest and kill black people in disproportionate numbers doesn\u2019t mean that all police officers target black people. If you\u2019re going to say that, you\u2019d have to prove that it\u2019s systematic. You\u2019d have to be able to show something crazy like a statewide police department ignoring violent white extremists and, instead, targeting nonviolent, anti-racism protesters.\n\nThere\u2019s no way that could be true. After all, the brave first responders put their lives on the line to protect and serve the American people. You\u2019re just anti-cop, aren\u2019t you? OK, let\u2019s just create a wild scenario that would prove widespread racism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFirst, your information would have to come from a reputable news outlet, like The Guardian.\n\nThen you would have to show a real intent, not just a subconscious bias. You\u2019d need to show that the police worked with a group that was blatantly racist, like the Traditionalist Worker Party, the group of white nationalists the Southern Poverty Law Center says \u201cadvocates for racially pure nations and communities.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOK, let\u2019s say The Guardian discovered this unbelievably racist scenario. You still would have to prove it. They\u2019d need documents of some sort. What if they found police reports that aligned officers of the California Highway Patrol with the TWP? Of course, it could never happen, but if it did, it would be the first step in proving that police were racist.\n\nBut it would only be the first step. Next, you\u2019d need some kind of event\u2014let\u2019s say the Nazis in the TWP organized a rally. At this racist rally, imagine if three people were stabbed, and all three victims were anti-racism protesters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOooh, I know! Let\u2019s say one of the anti-racist activists who were stabbed and bludgeoned\u2014let\u2019s just call this (not) imaginary victim \u201cYvette Falarca\u201d\u2014was then arrested, jailed for two nights and charged with assault, inciting a riot and participating in a riot. In the detailed report about why Falarca should be charged, it was noted that she often fought for the rights of students of color and women, as if those things were crimes. Wouldn\u2019t that be proof enough?\n\nNo? Well, what if one of the people who were stabbed implicated one of the organizers of the protest, Derik Punneo? Still not enough?\n\nWhat if the police knew Punneo had a knife? Do I still need more?\n\nWhat if video evidence showed Punneo near one of the stabbing victims? What if Punneo was arrested on an unrelated charge, and police used the opportunity to\u2014instead of questioning him\u2014show photographs of anti-racism activists so that they could go after them, including the people who were stabbed. What if all of this was recorded?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven better, what if there was another anti-racism activist who was stabbed in the abdomen, chest and hand? What if the police found photos of that man on Facebook holding up the Black Power salute and then wrote a report that it was evidence of his \u201csupport for anti-racist activism\u201d and demonstrated his \u201cintent and motivation to violate the civil rights\u201d of the Nazis? What if the report recommended that he be charged with 11 offenses, including disturbing the peace, conspiracy and unlawful assembly?\n\nAm I getting close to proving cops are racist?\n\nOK, there\u2019s one more thing I\u2019m going to tell you. Keep in mind that everything I say can be documented:\n\nI want to tell you about Donovan Ayres, a California Highway Patrol investigator. There is a recording of Ayres talking to the man who obtained the permit for the march, Doug McCormack. In the phone call, Ayres promises Nazi leader McCormack that he will protect him. The investigator tells McCormack that he will keep his name a secret. Ayres knows that McCormack was armed with a knife on the day of the march, but McCormack was not charged with a crime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf anyone could prove this, it would show that the cops are racist. But alas, it\u2019s just a scenario that actually happened, but which no one would ever believe.\n\nSteve Grippi, the chief deputy district attorney prosecuting the case in Sacramento, denied accusations of bias. The California Highway Parol would not comment. However, they are still trying to prosecute the stabbing victims the Nazis helped police hunt down. Prosecutors refuse to dismiss the case.\n\nDerik Punneo, Doug McCormack and two other members of the Traditionalist Worker Party who are shown in police photos carrying knives at the time of the stabbings have never been charged with a crime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlue Lives Matter.", "keywords": ["nationalists", "california", "mccormack", "youd", "white", "protected", "helped", "antiracism", "activists", "say", "report", "charged", "need", "hunt", "punneo", "racist", "ayres", "stabbed", "prove"], "polarity": 0.029249639249639248, "subjectivity": 0.486868686868687},

I hear it's the concrete jungle where dreams are made of.\n\nDamon and I are heading to the big city of dreams to meet and greet all of our newest co-workers with The Root/Gizmodo Media. It suggests to be a jolly and merry good time with food, drinks, and merriment.

You should have a meetup.\n\nBruh.\n\nWhat? For real for real. You should.\n\nThat's exactly what we're doing. In fact, on the very flyer up there that says \"vsb in nyc\" we state where we'll be around 830pm. We're doing dinner there - we hear it's awesome - and since Damon and I are muy lazy, we're like, \"why leave, why not just invite everybody to come where WE are!?\" So we're gonna be mackin' and hangin' at Burger and Lobster in the Flatiron district on Friday night (that's August 4th) at 830pm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt's like you read my mind. So meta. What can we expect if we come out see you guys? Free drinks? Lapdances? Firebreathers?\n\nProbably a solid mix of none of that shit. I mean, it's entirely possible that a round of shots might be on us. It is a celebration after all, and what's a celebration without shots. In DC, I bought a round of shots and handed them out to friends and strangers alike in celebration. Almost nobody said \"thank you\" either. But like Joe and Chico DeBarge sang to us\u2026.life has no guarantees.\n\nDid you really just name drop Chico DeBarge?\n\nYes. Yes I did. He should send me a thank you card.\n\nAre there any after Burger and Lobster plans?\n\nListen, I'm up for anything. We have a solid crew of folks in NYC that we're always happy to see and hang with and who allegedly believe in the turn up. But who knows where the night may take us.

We look out for people like that. If that's you, I promise, we do not bite. Come, commiserate, meet some new friends. Damon and I are the friendliest chaps you don't know, and despite his recent glow up, Damon hasn't gotten too big for his britches. He's still the same ole approachable G.

Because it comes from Donald Trump and the NRA, it is a flawless plan that is both stable and genius.\n\n1. If we want to stop police from killing unarmed black people, we must arm more black people.\n\nIf arming teachers is a good idea, it only makes sense that arming black people would result in fewer deaths. Bystanders often capture police officers shooting black men and women. What if\u2014instead of cellphones\u2014 those people had guns? Using the NRA\u2019s logic, that would make cops and citizens safer, right?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, some people may counter this argument with pesky facts like the 2015 study of FBI and national crime by the Violence Policy Center (pdf) that concluded that people are more likely to cause an accidental death than prevent a crime when pulling a gun in self-defense. Others will try to unearth the Washington Post report that showed that for every justifiable homicide using a gun, there were 34 criminal homicides, 78 gun suicides and two accidental deaths.\n\nOr maybe they might point to the FBI report on active shooters between 2000 and 2013 (pdf) that shows that only 3 percent of active shooters were stopped by someone with a gun, while 13 percent were stopped by an unarmed person. Maybe they will foolishly refer to a Stanford University study that shows that states with concealed-weapons laws have more violent crime. But you know what they say:\n\nThe only person who can stop a bad guy with a gun is an untrained, untested, underpaid, overworked person who\u2019s just trying to teach a fifth-period social studies class ... with a gun.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Pay them off.\n\nAnother mistake made by the Movement for Black Lives is the whole protest thing. I don\u2019t know what these folks were thinking. What we need is cash.\n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cWhere are black people supposed to get enough money to pay off police in every state, county and municipality in America?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s the beauty of this whole plan! We get sponsors and corporations to do it for us. The majority of the NRA\u2019s money comes from corporations, gun manufacturers and sponsors, not the rank-and-file membership.\n\nMaybe we can get some sponsorships from people who benefit from police not killing black people, like SheaMoisture or the prison industry. Perhaps we could even convince Pepsi to repurpose that old Kendall Jenner commercial.\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019re not using it.\n\nSpeaking of Kendall Jenner ...\n\n3. Make white kids the face of Black Lives Matter.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s noticed that white people don\u2019t seem to respond to angry black people. I haven\u2019t done any research in this area, so it\u2019s just conjecture on my part.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConversely, everyone in America is lauding the effort of the white teen activists who are fighting for gun reform. Perhaps you\u2019ve noticed this before. The gun-reform question was raised after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting and after the Las Vegas massacre, and it\u2019s been in serious overdrive since the tragedy in Parkland, Fla.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to call anyone racist, because there\u2019s always the chance that no one\u2019s heard about the gun violence in Chicago or the thousands of black kids in cities across America who are killed by bullets fired from the same kinds of weapons.\n\nYou know what? I\u2019m not going to cast aspersions by making it seem like white people only care about white lives or white-on-white crime. That would be racist. Instead, I\u2019ll give white people the benefit of the doubt and say that they probably don\u2019t know about Chicago or black-on-black crime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI haven\u2019t done any research in this area, so it\u2019s just conjecture on my part.\n\n4. Make it a mental health issue.\n\nBlack people, I know this one will be hard to do, but instead of painting cops who disproportionately kill black people as racist or evil, we should address the mental-illness aspect of the equation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Betty Shelby shot Terence Crutcher in the back as he was walking away, she probably wasn\u2019t evil. She might have simply been a \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d woman who \u201cfell through the cracks.\u201d\n\nPerhaps Jeronimo Yanez, who shot Philando Castile, was a \u201cbroken child,\u201d as accused Parkland shooter Nikolas Cruz has been described. How do you know Darren Wilson wasn\u2019t \u201cremorseful\u201d after killing Mike Brown, as Cruz apparently is?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Trump and the NRA says, this is a mental health issue, not a gun issue. Of course, it\u2019s hard for mentally ill people to kill people without guns, but let\u2019s not put too fine a point on this. If only there were a name to describe the mental illness that causes cops to stop, search, ticket and kill black people disproportionately. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s one; I just can\u2019t think of it right now.\n\n5. Invoke the Constitution and bring up the will of the Founding Fathers.\n\nThis is the longest shot. I\u2019m not a legal scholar, but I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s nothing in the Constitution that guarantees black people equal protection under the law. If there were, someone would surely have brought that up by now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NRA\u2019s entire argument is based on the fact that the right to bear arms is a fundamental right, so the government shouldn\u2019t be able to regulate arms, regardless of how many people are killed by gunfire.\n\nOn the other hand, Black Lives Matter is considered a terrorist organization by some people and is closely watched by federal, state and local law enforcement agencies, despite the fact that the organization has been charged with zero deaths.\n\nAgain, my lack of legal training hampers me from knowing this, but if there were a constitutional amendment that came before the Second Amendment and that guaranteed people the right to peaceably assemble, protest and say whatever they wanted, that would be so dope!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI wish the Founding Fathers had written something about all men being created equal. It would make a great argument if someone found an obscure document we could point to that said that all Americans have the right to life. If it said something about liberty and the pursuit of happiness, that would be even better ...\n\nBut for now, I\u2019d settle for life.\n\nBy enacting these steps, white people won\u2019t have to suffer the insufferable torture of having to dry their eyes when NFL players demean the freedom and liberty of America by silently kneeling. No longer will they be forced to close their beautiful eyes to avoid seeing another bullet-riddled black corpse. This plan will save their voices from having to reflexively scream, \u201cAll lives matter,\u201d when confronted with the prospect that a black life has actual value.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m doing this for you, white people.\n\nYou\u2019re welcome.", "keywords": ["know", "think", "trump", "lives", "crime", "matter", "white", "plan", "right", "stuff", "solved", "donald", "im", "nra", "racist", "black", "gun"], "polarity": 0.025407848324514988, "subjectivity": 0.4789535567313344},

Kuhn-Fricker alerted the principal of the high school that her daughter and Nicholas attended, warning the administrator of the violent account, according to the Washington Post.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe also staged an intervention with her daughter, seemingly convincing her to break up with the 17-year-old boy. Days later, Nicholas would kill her and her husband, Scott Fricker, in their home in Reston, Va., according to police.\n\nNow HuffPost has revealed the Twitter account Nicholas reportedly used, providing stark details about the nature of his beliefs and inspirations. The Twitter handle, @doctorpepper35, under the name Kevin Gallo, has since been suspended, but the HuffPost article contains several screenshot captures from the account.\n\nFrom HuffPost:\n\nAlmost three months before the murders, the teenager from Lorton, Va., praised a book called Siege, an obscure, ominous work written by James Mason, a neo-Nazi devotee of Charles Manson. The 1992 book, republished last year by hyperviolent white nationalist sect Atomwaffen Division, is essentially a call to \u201cHelter Skelter\u201d racist insurrection. Giampa also retweeted an endorsement of The Turner Diaries, William Luther Pierce\u2019s infamous white nationalist novel about race war, often found on the bookshelf of American domestic terrorists.\ufeff\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNicholas saved the worst attacks for Jews, Muslims and members of the LGTBQ community:\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve already talked 1 tranny into suicide and I\u2019m working on another 2 \ud83d\ude33,\u201d he bragged. Then he posted a rainbow lynching image, encouraging gay and transgender people to commit suicide. \u201c#transrightsarehumanrights is an oxymoron because trannies aren\u2019t \u2018people,\u2019\u201d Giampa tweeted that day.\ufeff\n\nAnd this:\n\nA white Europe without Jewish or Muslim individuals \u201csounds like heaven,\u201d Giampa tweeted on Nov. 11. The next day, he tweeted \u201cThe jews are everyone\u2019s enemy.\u201d He tweeted in support of nationalist marchers in Poland seeking to rid the country of Muslims and Jews. \u201cMuslims and jews are incapable of assimilating and a threat to their culture,\u201d he wrote.\ufeff\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs HuffPost shows, leading up to the double murder, Nicholas openly identified as a Nazi, retweeted pro-Hitler memes, and called for various neo-Nazi and white nationalist groups to come together as part of a \u201cwhite revolution.\u201d\n\nHis social media track record is disturbing, but in a way that has become increasingly familiar.\n\nThis is the part of the HuffPost report that has me messed up:\n\n\u201cI apologize for all the unhappiness for everyone. I am sincerely sorry,\u201d said one of Giampa\u2019s family members, who broke into tears on the phone. \u201cIn the end, we need one more gun law. Any address, anywhere, that has mental illness, there cannot be guns.\u201d\ufeff\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet me first say this: Nicholas and his girlfriend did go to a private high school for students with special needs, according to HuffPost. The nature and extent of his mental or behavioral issues is still largely unknown.\n\nBut it\u2019s dangerous and irresponsible to isolate Nicholas\u2019 \u201cmental illness\u201d as the reason for the cold-blooded murder he\u2019s accused of\u2014not when he publicly and loudly voiced his desire to exterminate entire groups of people.\n\nThis is a young man who mowed a 40-foot swastika into a community field in his neighborhood. A young man whose mother, who reportedly voiced support for Confederate generals and monuments on her Facebook page, took her son to a gun range to fire a submachine gun. A young man who unabashedly praised murderers and dictators and called for race wars.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are some psychiatrists who believe that \u201cextreme racism\u201d is, in fact, a mental illness. But to blame mental illness for gun violence is just incorrect: As CNN reports, studies have shown that \u201cthe vast majority of people with severe mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or severe depression, are no more likely to be violent than anyone else.\u201d\n\nIn fact, people suffering from severe mental illness are 10 times more likely to be victims of violent crime.\n\nWhich is what makes the quote from Nicholas\u2019 family member so appalling, even as a part of me understands the desire to protect a loved one by branding him a tragic example of mental illness gone unchecked. It preserves, to some degree, his innocence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe problem is that this desire obscures who Nicholas really is, who he proclaimed himself over and over to be. And an unwillingness to see that\u2014to listen when the monster tells you his name\u2014all but guarantees that more of the same will continue.\n\nRead more at HuffPost.", "keywords": ["murder", "nicholas", "tweeted", "huffpost", "white", "nationalist", "jews", "charged", "neonazi", "identifies", "twitter", "illness", "tied", "young", "disturbing", "teen", "mental", "heres", "gun"], "polarity": -0.03765458422174841, "subjectivity": 0.44691186922530185},

(Folks have also seen countless videos of police brutality and killings of black folks, but they still don\u2019t think black lives matter; but I digress.) I mention the documentary with the cult following because now, more than ever, health is at the forefront and most of us are eating our vegetables without even being told to.

On Saturday, both Delta Air Lines and its competitor United joined that growing list by announcing that they were ceasing discounts for NRA members.\n\nAccording to Raw Story, Delta also asked the NRA to remove its airline information from its site.\n\nBut Georgia Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle and his fellow NRA-thirsty cronies lawmakers will not stand for such injustice. On Monday, Cagle, who just so happens to be plotting a run for the state\u2019s governorship, announced that he and his fellow conservatives were fighting back.\n\n\u201cI will kill any tax legislation that benefits Delta unless the company changes its position and fully reinstates its relationship with the NRA,\u201d Cagle tweeted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe public threat was directed toward Delta in particular because the airline is based in Atlanta. It\u2019s also one of the biggest employers in Georgia.\n\nSo why would a (presumably) job-loving, Georgia-devoted Republican target one of the largest employers in his state over what CNBC says is a 2-10 percent discount? And, moreover, is such a move legal?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCagle\u2019s warning certainly appeases the NRA and its supporters, many of whom called for a Delta boycott following the airline\u2019s announcement, as Raw Story notes. (I mean, if you\u2019re about that Spirit Air life, girl, go ahead, I guess.) And because he\u2019s on the ballot this year, the tough stance will ingratiate Casey and other candidates to Second Amendment-loving voters who can\u2019t fathom not getting preferential treatment and cheaper window seats for owning a damn gun.\n\nIt\u2019s also, apparently, perfectly legal. Robert Schapiro, an Emory University School of Law professor quoted in the Raw Story article, said, state lawmakers have lots of discretion when it comes to levying\u2014or cutting\u2014taxes on companies:\n\n\u201cIn terms of legality, the legislature has a broad ability to grant tax exemptions or not grant tax exemptions,\u201d Schapiro said. \u201cSo it doesn\u2019t violate any constitutional principle\u201d to pull support over the NRA debate.\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRaw Story also notes that Georgia lawmakers are currently considering a jet-fuel-tax exemption that was drawn up specifically to benefit Delta. As of Monday, however, some state Republicans had threatened to pull their support.\n\nIn a statement, Delta reiterated that it supports the Second Amendment, and that ceasing the NRA discount \u201creflects the airline\u2019s neutral status\u201d in the national gun control debate.\n\nAndrea Young, the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia, also responded to Cagle, criticizing the lieutenant governor and pointing out that Atlanta had been selected as a finalist for housing Amazon.com\u2019s second U.S. headquarters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an emailed statement to Time magazine, Young wrote that \u201cpoliticians should not use taxpayer dollars to impose ideological litmus tests and punish organizations that express views that politicians dislike.\n\n\n\n\u201cAmazon should take note,\u201d Young added.\n\nAs should any voter who values jobs over saving $20 off a damn airline ticket.", "keywords": ["discounts", "governor", "raw", "wannabe", "hes", "loves", "biggest", "georgia", "employers", "nra", "cagle", "young", "state", "second", "lawmakers", "threatening", "tax", "states", "delta"], "polarity": -0.020344635523206957, "subjectivity": 0.356445043052186},

In October 2017, the TWP organized the pathetic White Lives Matter rally in Murfreesboro, Tenn. The group led a lynch mob to push for Kate\u2019s Law after blaming the death of Kate Steinle on immigration laws. Multiple people were stabbed at the group\u2019s 2016 Sacramento, Calif., rally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe group was founded by besties Matthew Heimbach and David \u201cMatt\u201d Parrot. Heimbach would go on to gain notoriety for beating up a black woman at a Donald Trump rally, starting White Student Unions on college campuses and overseeing an attack on an interracial couple. Heimbach and the TWP\u2019s prominence at the deadly rally in Charlottesville, Va., made them rising stars in the world of hate.\n\nBut like Destiny\u2019s Child, iPhone cords and every episode of Jerry Springer, things quickly fall apart.\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center reports that Heimbach was arrested on battery charges and posted a $1,000 bond on Tuesday and that Parrot is no longer a part of the party, saying that he believes the organization is done.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt all began Monday in an Indiana trailer park. (Of course, I\u2019ll give you a minute to find a chair, because any story that starts with \u201cIt all began in an Indiana trailer park\u201d is going to be good.)\n\nAccording to the Daily Beast, Heimbach had been sleeping with Parrot\u2019s wife, Jessica, for a while. Heimbach, meanwhile, is married to Parrot\u2019s stepdaughter from a previous marriage. Now, I know you think this all sounds like a \u201cwhite trash circus\u201d\u2014as Parrot called it\u2014but how else are they supposed to keep their race \u201csuperior\u201d?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHeimbach and Jessica swore to Parrot that their affair was over, but to test their loyalty, Parrot decided to \u201cset up\u201d the neo-Nazi mastermind and his wife in a trailer and see what happened.\n\nOf course, Heimbach smashed Jessica\u2019s Lil\u2019 Debbie cakes to smithereens! Did you think, even for a minute, that Nazis had morals? Parrot peeped it all through a window, as he was perched on a box outside. But when his makeshift pedestal broke and he fell, Parrot went in to confront the cheaters. According to the report, a fight ensued, and Heimbach choked Parrot to sleep.\n\nParrot woke up, fled to the local Walmart and called the cops. When cops arrived at Heimbach\u2019s house, they found him outside with Jessica. Jessica left and Heimbach went inside, telling his wife to send the cops away. When she wouldn\u2019t, Heimbach\u2019s wife, who is also the ex-stepdaughter of Parrot, alleges that Heimbach attacked her by pinching her cheeks until they bled while her daughter recorded the incident on a cellphone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStop laughing; this isn\u2019t over.\n\nThe cops arrested Heimbach on the spot, noting that his two children were present when Heimbach attacked his children\u2019s mother ... after having had sex with his ex-stepmother-in-law.\n\nThe police noted on their report that the people they interviewed\u2014spokesperson Parrot, stepdaughter-wife Mrs. Heimbach, Mrs. Parrot the side piece and Matthew the Cheating Choker Cheek Pincher\u2014all listed their occupations as \u201cwhite nationalist.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cObviously, due to the events that transpired, people have lost faith in the party on every level. I totally respect that, and it\u2019s my job to protect that information,\u201d Parrot said, explaining that there is no more Traditionalist Workers Party.\n\nAnd even though these hillbilly troglodytes still think they are \u201csupreme,\u201d this story has given me so much delight that I feel I must say this about the breakup of the TWP:\n\nThey will be missed.", "keywords": ["know", "brawl", "wife", "wanted", "heimbach", "group", "think", "parrot", "white", "party", "broke", "hate", "rally", "park", "piece", "nazi", "jessica", "cops", "trailer"], "polarity": 0.06544401544401546, "subjectivity": 0.33638996138996136},

So, basically, it\u2019s a conversation that proclaims: We schaid what we schaid.\n\n\n\nIt all started in a Slack conversation. Someone (who wishes to remain nameless) from our Jezebel family admitted: \u201cI have to confess. I don\u2019t like Insecure.\u201d What did that person do that for?! Immediately, everyone in the Slack room started responding. First up were some of the core team members from The Root:\n\n\n\nSomeone from The Root: I never have. So you\u2019re not alone.\n\nAnd then i09\u2019s Evan Narcisse joined in: I mentioned to a friend a while back that I\u2019ve never seen a single ep of Queen Sugar, and he was like, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to! We got options!\u201d\n\nFrom there, the conversation turned into a bold discussion centered on unpopular opinions about TV shows that we should like but are either bored by, uninterested in or just can\u2019t get into at all. These shows are all very popular, like Insecure, Queen Sugar, Game of Thrones, Power and more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDanielle Belton: I love Queen Sugar, but it is basically just a really well done family soap opera.\n\nSomeone from The Root: I love Queen Sugar but it\u2019s too black for mainstream lol.\n\nDanielle Young: Queen Sugar is so black!\n\nThe conversation turned to the beauty of Queen Sugar but the inherent blackness that keeps it from crossing over into mainstream. And then there was the Game of Thrones slander from yours truly. I do not watch it. Go ahead, be mad, roll your eyes. But I\u2019m not alone in this unpopular opinion.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSomeone from The Root: GOT is garbage.\n\nBut our managing editor, Danielle Belton, was not going to let that person get away with that.\n\n\n\nDanielle Belton: You don\u2019t even watch Game of Thrones!

I prepared myself for the backlash, but I was met with mutuality from the women of Jezebel, who also think Claws is hilarious.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSomeone from The Root: I just found out Claws wasn\u2019t a comedy ... so maybe I\u2019ll watch it now.\n\nDanielle Young: Claws is like How to Get Away With Murder meets Steel Magnolia.\n\nThe Root\u2019s video editor, P.J.

I was wrong. In the 150 miles between Pittsburgh and Cumberland, Md., we saw four.\n\nThe dearth of black people on the GAP trail should be no surprise to anyone who\u2019s driven through Pennsylvania. A popular joke about the state is that it\u2019s Pittsburgh on one side, Philadelphia on the other and Alabama in between. The \u201cjoke,\u201d of course, is that once you leave those metropolitan areas, you\u2019re surrounded by small towns and rural farmland. And \u201csurrounded by small towns and rural farmland\u201d is a euphemistic way of saying \u201csurrounded by whiteness.\u201d\n\nThing is, that dynamic isn\u2019t exactly unique to Pennsylvania. Regardless of where you are in the country, once you get 10-15 miles outside a city\u2019s greater metropolitan area, you\u2019re probably going to splash into a sea of white people. And that sea probably won\u2019t end until you\u2019re near another city. It\u2019s so stark that if you had no concept of America and you asked an American where the black people lived, they could just draw a small circle around the 30 largest cities, say \u201cthere\u201d and be mostly accurate. And then, if you asked where the white people lived, they could say, \u201cThere, too. And everywhere else.\u201d\n\nIn America, white people are everywhere, and this ubiquity connects to perhaps our greatest irony: We (black people) are vastly outnumbered by them. They also own more land, earn and possess more money, and have all the guns. Most of the people making laws are white, as are most of the people enforcing them. There are entire states you can drive through without seeing one of us, entire lives that can be led without ever having any meaningful interaction with us. We are surrounded, outnumbered, out-resourced and outgunned. Our entire existence here is a continual assault on our bodies.\n\nBut we are the ones perceived to be the threats. We are the ones they\u2019re scared of. We are the ones who tell our children how to dress and how to wear their hair so they\u2019re not thought of as threats to them. We are the ones who consciously and subconsciously modify our voices and our behavior when forced to interact with them. We\u2019re the ones whom trained officers with weapons and badges and handcuffs and legal justifications are so damn scared of that we\u2019ve created entire curricula based on that fear, teaching ourselves what to do to seem less frightening to them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis fear is why they\u2019re so obsessed with arming themselves with multiple human killing machines. It\u2019s why they fight against even the notion of incremental disarmament so vehemently. They are scared shitless of us. Of anyone who is not them. And this fear is why our shitty gun laws exist, and it\u2019s why they will continue to.\n\nPerhaps this fear is guilt-based, and they\u2019re scared the same way you were as a kid when you stole some cash from your teacher\u2019s purse. And you kept waiting for repercussions, but they just never came. But that fear\u2014that feeling that you\u2019d have to answer for your wrongs eventually\u2014never quite left. Or maybe this fear is karmic. A belief that once we \u201cget on top,\u201d we\u2019ll treat them the way they\u2019ve treated us. And that fear drives them to do whatever they can to maintain their position.\n\nEither way, I doubt we\u2019ll see any movement on guns until they acknowledge this pervasive and delusional and self-destructive collective fear and go to therapy.

But Pittsburgh has other plans.\n\nFrom The Incline:\n\nWith a deadline nearing for action on a plan to remove and relocate Oakland\u2019s Stephen Foster memorial statue, Mayor Bill Peduto\u2019s office today announced it is \u201cseeking the public\u2019s help in selecting an African American woman to be honored with a statue\u201d at the site. \u201cThere are very few monuments in Pittsburgh dedicated to the many women leaders who have left their mark on the city,\u201d a statement from the mayor and his Task Force on Women in Public Art announced. \u201cAt present, there are no African American women represented,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cAs the Stephen Foster statue is set to be removed from its current site in April, the city has a unique opportunity to build something in its place honoring the legacy of African American women and their impressive leadership in Pittsburgh.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs tempted as I am for this statue to stay up long enough for me to take a selfie with it (I still haven\u2019t), I have to admit that this is ... good news. Extending this honor to one of the many black women who\u2019ve played a vital role in Pittsburgh\u2019s history would be, well, awesome.\n\nLet\u2019s just hope they don\u2019t throw a curveball and choose Stacey Dash.", "keywords": ["kale", "women", "dont", "statue", "replace", "woman", "americas", "foster", "stephen", "piece", "racist", "black", "city", "pittsburgh"], "polarity": 0.152, "subjectivity": 0.4244938271604939},

More of a surreality anxious.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have so many questions.\n\nI have so many answers.\n\nI don't know where to start.\n\nThat's fine. I'll start for you.\n\nOver the past year and a half, we've been approached by several different entities interested in some sort of partnership. Some wanted to merge us with already existing platforms. Others were interested in creating something new. Univision was one of those entities, and we believed that joining them was the best opportunity for us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnivision though? That's a surprise.\n\nNot if you're aware of the business of digital media. In the past year and a half, Univision acquired Gizmodo Media Group (GMG) \u2014 home of Deadspin, Jezebel, Fusion, The Root, Lifehacker, Jalopnik, Gizmodo, and Kotaku \u2014 and also has a 40% stake in The Onion (which includes the AV Club and Clickhole). These are some of the most popular and beloved spaces on the Internet, and we're going to be a part of that ecosystem. Specifically, we're going to be a vertical of The Root. VSB will still be VSB, though.\n\nSo you're still going to run VSB?\n\nYes. Only now we're going to be Univision employees.\n\nSo basically you're getting paid to do something you've been doing for free for nine years?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExactly!\n\nSo\u2026while I understand that, why even partner? I mean, you all seem to be doing pretty well already. You already got a book deal and a gig at GQ, and both you and Panama seem to get invited all over the country to speak. Why not just remain completely autonomous?\n\nBoth Panama and I have had ambitions to grow VSB, and we've been lucky enough to be able to do that. We currently get around two million unique visitors per month \u2014 a far cry from the day when I did a celebratory Harlem Shake the first time we cracked 100,000. But we are a staff of one and a half people \u2014 me and Panama (whose day job limits how much time he's able to devote to VSB). That's it. Which means that along with writing and editing, we're responsible for all of the logistical and administrative duties necessary for maintaining VSB. That means (sometimes) reading and (sporadically) replying to the hundreds of emails we get per day, monitoring each of VSB's social media accounts, moderating the thousands of comments we receive, and the rest of the daily and weekly responsibilities I'm neglecting to mention. And doing all of that shit takes time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor instance, you may have noticed that our content has decreased in frequency over the past few months. That's because we've had to devote time and energy to all of the conversations \u2014 emails, texts, phone calls, and meetings \u2014 regarding this deal. (Plus, I'm writing a book, which obviously requires time and attention too.)\n\nBasically, as long as one and a half people were required to do the jobs of seven or eight, our potential for growth would always be limited. With this deal, however, we'll be able to focus our attention on being creative, since GMG and The Root have those administrative infrastructures in place. And we'll have access to Univision's amazing resources. (Which means we'll be able to do podcasts, short videos and more panels and events.) And we'll have a budget to pay writers actual competitive rates instead of the bite-sized Snickers and lapdances from Panama we offer now. (Which means you'll see more of us and more of people like Alex Hardy and Shamira Ibrahim.) And Panama is leaving his job to work full-time on VSB now too. (And neither of us will have to move anywhere. He's staying in D.C. and I'm staying in Pittsburgh.)\n\nShit, Panama is leaving his job?

Probably some time next week.\n\nAlso, we're giving up control of something we created nine years ago and have been nurturing since.

Rick Scott speaks to the media as he visits Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School after a shooting at the school killed 17 people on Feb. 14, 2018, in Parkland, Fla. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\nThe student-led push to finally bring a semblance of gun control appears to be working in Florida. Gov. Rick Scott and other state lawmakers on Friday offered a series of proposals that would mark \u201cthe most significant move toward gun control in Florida in decades.\u201d\n\nThe proposed gun laws defy the National Rifle Association and President Donald Trump, who have suggested arming educators as a way to fight the epidemic of school shootings, the New York Times reports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to NBC News, Scott explicitly said that he disagrees with arming school teachers.\n\n\u201cMy focus is on bringing in law enforcement,\u201d Scott said. \u201cI think you need to have individuals who are trained, well trained.\u201d\n\nScott\u2019s plan includes the following:\n\nRaising the minimum age to buy any firearm from 18 to 21 (currently, 18-year-olds can purchase semi-automatic rifles but not handguns);\n\nOutlawing bump stocks, a kind of modification that allows gun users to fire their weapons faster;\n\nRequiring more safety and mental health training for school personnel;\n\nEstablishing improved processes for authorities to share information about potential at-risk students and security threats;\n\nIncreasing law enforcement presence in schools;\n\nMaking it more difficult for individuals with mental health issues to access weapons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Times reports that other Florida lawmakers have proposed creating a \u201cmarshal\u201d program that would let teachers who have enough hours of training with law enforcement to carry a weapon on campus.\n\nThe proposals do stop short of the sort of gun reform that student-activists have been pleading for, which includes a ban on the AR-15 semi-automatic rifle.\n\n\u201cBanning specific weapons is not going to fix this,\u201d said Scott, a man who proposed banning a specific modification because he believed that would \u201cfix\u201d things.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome of the proposals put forward by the governor are concerning for other reasons.\n\nAs many mental health advocates have noted, most gun violence is not attributable to mental illness. \u201cMental health professionals welcome more resources and attention,\u201d as noted in a recent PBS article, \u201cbut they say the administration is ignoring the real problem\u201d\u2014that of easy access to guns.\n\nAmerican Medical Association President David Barbe also emphasized this in his interview with PBS, saying that improved access to mental health care was important, but \u201cto blame this all just on mental illness is not sufficient.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe proposed laws also place a heavy emphasis on putting more law enforcement inside schools. Gov. Scott requested $500 million to implement mental health and school-safety programs and to ensure that each Florida public school had at least one armed officer for every 1,000 students.\n\nBut the recent example of the Florida deputy who failed to respond to the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School should reveal the limitations of this plan. In addition, the disproportionate policing and punishment of students of color by school police means that Florida schools could actually become more dangerous places for black students.\n\nSo what sorts of gun reform should be on the table?\n\nWhile the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been barred from researching gun violence since the mid-1990s, there is some data suggesting that certain policies are more effective than others. According to Scientific American, these include:\n\nrequiring a permit to purchase a firearm that must be applied for, in person, at a local law enforcement agency\n\nbanning individuals convicted of any violent crime from gun purchase\n\nmaking all domestic violence offenders surrender their guns\n\ntemporarily banning active alcohol abusers from owning firearms\n\nAs for an assault weapons ban, the New York Times writes that Florida Senate Democrats have promised to amend any GOP gun bill with the addition of an assault weapon ban, but since they\u2019re outnumbered in both chambers of the state Legislature, those measures would be unlikely to pass.", "keywords": ["school", "shouldnt", "trump", "health", "florida", "scott", "yes", "celebrate", "ranks", "proposed", "rick", "nra", "law", "weapons", "enforcement", "gov", "mental", "gun"], "polarity": 0.06170078509061563, "subjectivity": 0.4295568273534376},

Kim Kimble was a star hairstylist long before her WeTV show L.A. Hair debuted in 2012, and she\u2019s still one today. Her receipts run deep: Yes, she\u2019s even slayed Queen Bey. Multiple times. On tour. Lemonade. Going way back to Austin Powers in Goldmember.\n\nAnd those bold, blond tresses on Oprah for the Ava DuVernay-directed A Wrinkle in Time? Those are the extra-platinum receipts. Like the hair boss she is, Kimble was in charge of all the unbeweaveable action in AWIT. Yep, That\u2019s Mindy Kaling, Reese Witherspoon, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Storm Reid and the whole shebang.\n\nIn the Disney big-screen adaptation of Madeleine L\u2019Engle\u2019s classic 1962 novel, a girl named Meg Murry, along with adopted brother Charles Wallace and friend Calvin O\u2019Keefe, sets out to find her scientist dad aided by celestial aides, but Hollywood and Kim Kimble found each other much more easily.\n\nKimble got her first film break creating hairstyles for the zany 1997 film B*A*P*S. And in a glimpse of things to come, her outrageous hair flair even landed the Chicago-born, Los Angeles-made hair artist on what else? The Oprah Winfrey Show!\n\nPhoto: DAndre Michael Inc.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, this isn\u2019t the first time Kimble has crossed paths with director DuVernay, either. DuVernay is a former client and collaborator on other (smaller) projects. So when DuVernay called Kimble about the $100 million Wrinkle, she minced no words: \u201cYou want to be a part of this project, because the hair is really creative. And this is something you really want to do, because it\u2019s going to be Oscar-worthy hair!\u201d\n\n\n\nHow could the hair star not be all in?

International Beauty Show (which we casually know as a \u201chair show\u201d\u2014shoutout to Chris Rock\u2019s Good Hair), she dished all things hair and AWIT.\n\nOn from B*A*P*S to AWIT:\n\nI used to do a lot of fantasy hair competitions, and [director] Robert Townsend picked hairstyles I had done before in shows [for B*A*P*S]. [For Wrinkle], I had to be more creative, and I had to really search more on what to do with the hair because I really didn\u2019t have anything to reference other than the book, and these were women from the universe. And what does a woman from the universe look like? There\u2019s no real reference to that, but it was fun creating that. So I wanted something and Ava [also] wanted something that was more avant-garde, but something that was also kind of couture but very fashionable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn creating the looks for each Mrs.:\n\nI had to do a couple of meetings with Ava. That gave me ideas of how far she wanted to go with the look, and basically coming up with the color for each person. We went through, I want to say, 200 tear sheets of just ideas, and then it was very difficult to narrow down which looks, but we had to collaborate with the clothes and makeup. We had to all kind of work together to create the image of what this was going to look like because we didn\u2019t want the hair competing with the clothes, and it needed to be cohesive and go together. It took a while for the clothes to really come together, so we put some ideas out there. Then, once I got to see the clothes, I pulled from the ideas that I thought would work best with the clothes. And then we did camera tests. So we got to actually see the clothes and the hair and the makeup altogether.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Disney\n\nOn Oprah\u2019s Mrs. Which hair and what it means:\n\nTo me, I call her \u201cthe diva of the universe.\u201d Her clothes are metallic. Her hair color was metallic. We blended like platinum, gold and a little bit of bronze ... we custom-made all her hair. She was like, \u201cI don\u2019t want my ordinary color. I want something really different.\u201d Out of all the colors, this one was, to me, the most striking, and it was very soft and beautiful on her. And then, of course, her hair was big and in textures, so we did a lot of curls and big hair. She had like a long braid at one point. So I just look at her like she\u2019s the diva of the universe and her hair is made up of minerals of the earth. That\u2019s why platinum, gold and bronze and those things blended together made up her hair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Mindy Kaling\u2019s Mrs. Who hair:\n\nHer hair color didn\u2019t really change, but what was different about her is that she had a lot of texture going on. She had little braids. Her thing was more cultural. So she was all these different cultures. Like Asian, African, Spanish, Indian; all these different cultures kind of made up Mrs. Who. If you look at her clothes, she\u2019s like a quilt of just everything, and that was sort of the idea behind her image and her look. If you noticed, she had a lot of braided stuff and sculpted hairstyles.\n\nOn Reese Witherspoon\u2019s Mrs. Whatsit hair:\n\nShe was more earthy but, yet, a little fiery. She was a bit more whimsical and kind of quirky, in a way. She\u2019s almost like a flower child with a little fire, I guess. Red was something I thought was very different for Reese. ... We really wanted to create this whole other image. I didn\u2019t want you to look at her and see Reese. I wanted you to look at her and see a different person. The same thing with Oprah and Mindy. You wanted to see, like, a completely different person.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn styling Storm Reid\u2019s natural hair for Meg Murry:\n\nWe did take some things from the book because Ava, you know, she wanted to definitely be able to connect with fans of the book. The character, she had curly hair also. But, also, I thought this was a great way to go because natural hair is such a big thing and it\u2019s such a big statement. I love that women are starting to embrace and understand how to deal with [natural hair] because, for years, we didn\u2019t even know how to deal with natural hair. But her having natural hair, naturally curly hair, is great ...\n\nPhoto: Disney\n\nI think it\u2019s good for young girls to be able to look up to someone and to see this young African-American woman starring in a big film having natural hair. It\u2019s going to be great for young women to identify. Even though I do feel like this newer generation is understanding more about natural hair and embracing it more, it\u2019s great to see that on the big screen. Because for years, you had to have straight hair to be on TV. Natural hair wasn\u2019t accepted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn how AWIT even wowed her:\n\nThere was so much women power on this movie. [You had] Ava directing this big film and you got Mindy, Oprah and Reese. They\u2019re acting in this movie, but Oprah has her own network and she\u2019s got several films she\u2019s produced. Reese produced Big Little Lies and then Mindy producing her own shows. These women are powerhouses. Being able to work around these women, I loved that energy! It was just powerhouses of women throughout the whole project.\n\nThe Glow Up tip: We know you love to support black films, so let\u2019s show Hollywood that they count.

I\u2019d seen her achieve as much in her other films with far less capital behind them than the history-making, $100 million budget that Disney provided this time, so there was no question that this film would be gorgeous.\n\nI was expecting Oprah Winfrey to blow my mind playing Mrs. Which, the wisest being in the universe, dressed as an intergalactic angel with gravity-defying Kim Kimble hair. And I was expecting Storm Reid, the wide-eyed, curly-haired 14-year-old star of the film, to break boundaries of the imagination for other children about what a fantasy-film hero looks like.\n\nBut I was not expecting this film to be retroactively healing for this 32-year-old black woman who grew up feeling shut out of a genre I love.\n\nAt the Los Angeles press screening of the film just days before the world premiere, DuVernay surprised the audience by showing up to introduce it. \u201cLet your inner child watch this movie,\u201d she instructed, and I obeyed.\n\nWithin minutes of Storm\u2019s appearance on-screen with her sweet face, African nose and natural hair, I surprised myself when I started to tear up. Sure, it\u2019s upsetting that her character, Meg Murry, is being bullied by teachers, students and her principal over the mysterious disappearance of her father into another dimension; and yes, the film is rich with inspiring messages of overcoming evil with love and light that tug on every heartstring.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t why, by the end of the film, I was alternating between wiping away full-on tears and letting them fall, uninterrupted. It took a moment for me to understand what was being released in that theater.\n\nIn the mid- to late 1990s, I was a budding child actress growing up in Virginia who\u2019d landed representation with the New York City talent agent famous for discovering Tom Cruise: Toby Gibson. I had filmed my first SAG-AFTRA-qualifying gig as a guest star on the PBS show The Puzzle Place, had two callbacks for the part of Bethany on the ABC drama Second Noah and was thrilled out of my mind to lose the role to the little girl from Crooklyn (Crooklyn!). Things were looking up for my fledgling career. Then my military father was relocated to Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska and everything changed.\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of Brooke Obie\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFolks weren\u2019t checking for young black actresses in Nebraska. Besides a Wow! potato chips commercial that never aired, and an infomercial for a product to protect your computer from the inevitable crash of Y2K (aww, the \u201990s!), all the parts I auditioned for went to children of a whiter hue. So I tried my hand at theater and was accepted into the local children\u2019s company. But even there, I had little success, playing nameless background roles. In one production, they had me playing one of many \u201cNative American children.\u201d I shudder to remember what that entailed.\n\nSo when the company announced that they\u2019d be putting on the play based on one of my favorite books, A Wrinkle in Time, in my 12-year-old mind it was a sign. I couldn\u2019t help but kill an audition for Meg\u2014a bullied middle school kid who didn\u2019t fit in but who gets to fly, gets the guy and gets to be the hero. I read for the part and put into my audition every drop of emotion I\u2019d felt being isolated as the only black girl in a sea of white classmates and teachers every day. Finally! This Midwestern nightmare was going to serve a greater purpose.\n\nNot quite.\n\nWhen they announced the casting of a white girl with brown hair and glasses as Meg\u2014just like in the book\u2014I remember thinking, \u201cOf course.\u201d I was more disappointed in myself that I had even thought I had a chance at the role. Black girls can\u2019t be Meg. Black girls don\u2019t belong here. Not even in fantasy. I wound up playing a part so small that it\u2019s not even listed on the SparkNotes character list online, so I can\u2019t recall it now. I quit acting after that production.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt would take another 14 years before I would begin to challenge the limits that had been put on my imagination as a child, including that experience. By 2016 I\u2019d published my first novel, a reimagining of American history, about a black teen girl who escapes from her enslaver, the first president, and starts a revolution.\n\nWhen agents, editors and publishing houses said they couldn\u2019t imagine an audience wanting to read such a story, I laughed. Their limits were no longer mine; nor were they shared by the readers I\u2019ve met across the country and in the United Kingdom on tour. Book of Addis wound up winning literary awards for fiction. Pushing through those limits and achieving my definition of success with my novel, I thought that meant I was healed.\n\nAnd then I found myself bawling in a Disney theater as Sade sang \u201cFlower of the Universe\u201d at the end credits of A Wrinkle in Time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, black children need to see this film so they can know that they, too, can be heroes. Yes, all children need to see this film\u2014especially boys\u2014so they can know how to follow the lead of a black girl. But I needed to see this film, too.\n\nTwelve-year-old me needed to see beautiful black Storm Reid be Meg and be an outcast and deal with depression and be a hero anyway and travel through space and fly. Twelve-year-old me needed to see Oprah speak life into that little girl\u2019s fear and low self-esteem and say that if she just finds the right frequency, she, too, can fly. Twelve-year-old me needed Ava DuVernay to create the space for all of that #BlackGirlMagic to shine on-screen.\n\nAnd by creating that space, DuVernay wrinkled time, found that little girl in the \u201990s who had been trapped for years in a white void and flung the escape hatch wide open. With one film, she reminded me of the healing power of the imagination, and then she healed a hole in my heart that I didn\u2019t even remember existed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMagic, just as I expected.", "keywords": ["wrinkle", "girl", "needed", "expecting", "white", "power", "children", "little", "playing", "black", "retroactive", "healing", "film"], "polarity": 0.09692197683269113, "subjectivity": 0.49359370787942186},

It may well be, but like any tactic, it brings with it its own risks.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe movement seems to be linking photos to names and though they seem to have identified several of the actual neo-Nazis and white supremacists involved, there have already been high-profile cases of mistaken identity or missed context.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne widely trafficked tweet, for example, got over 14,000 retweets and climbing after claiming to have outed dumb right-wing YouTube personality Joey Salads wearing a Nazi armband at the rally. The photo was indeed of Salads wearing a Nazi armband, not to exalt Adolf Hitler per se, but for the equally stupid purpose of trying to prove Donald Trump\u2019s supporters aren\u2019t racists.\n\nAnother widely trafficked post from the same account identified the wrong white supremacist. In other posts, it inaccurately labeled a photo of a man being arrested as racist organizer Richard Spencer, as well as said it had got one alleged supremacist terminated from their job.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see the appeal of doxxing. White supremacists have effectively weaponized the psuedo-anonymous nature of the internet to their advantage, organizing online and staging rallies far from home to offset the risk of their identities being exposed. They\u2019ve also enjoyed near impunity from the actual authorities, who largely stood down in Charlottesville while attendees beat counter-protesters and marched around with weaponry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHitting back on both fronts is a way to wipe the smile off their faces and force them to justify themselves directly. Though the primary concern by most users seems to be flagging the danger the supremacists poses to others, in some cases doxxing supremacists has also worked to bring them out of the movement. There\u2019s also an obvious material difference between doxxing as a form of harassment and pulling the mask off of fascists.\n\nBut when mistakes are made, it can help ruin an innocent person\u2019s life, quick. In 2015, members of Anonymous compiled a list of supposed Ku Klux Klan members that was littered with fake or misleading information. Last year, innocent black gun owner Mark Hughes received thousands of death threats after being falsely accused of shooting over a dozen people at a Black Lives Matter protest in Dallas.

I know I haven\u2019t talked to you in a while, but I come to you as humbly as I know how, with one simple request: I have been reading about the protests around the \u201calt-right\u201d gym in Nashville, Tenn., and I would like a one-day guest membership. I already know what Black Jesus would say if I asked him, so unto thee I ask these blessings in your name. Sincerely, yours truly, forever and ever. Amen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the Nashville Scene and Fox 17 in Nashville, people are upset about the new East Nashville, Tenn., gym where disgruntled Caucasians can channel their hate into bench presses and jumping jacks. A group called \u201cShowing up for Racial Justice, Nashville\u201d held a rally against the gym, Vengeance Strength Kvlt.\n\nThe new gym\u2019s website opens with the sentence: \u201cThis is probably not the gym for you,\u201d and goes on to say that \u201cyou cannot exercise the fat off your ass.\u201d\n\nTrust me, this is the gym for me. I\u2019ve often wondered how anyone got the strength and endurance to carry heavy, wooden crosses to black people\u2019s lawns before they set them ablaze. Plus, one of my greatest joys in life is watching white people dance. (Because I believe black people can dance, but white people love dancing far more than we do. If you don\u2019t believe me, ask yourself this question: Have you ever been to a wedding, concert or picnic where there wasn\u2019t at least one white person writhing in ecstasy with no regard for who was watching or the song\u2019s beats per minute? Case closed.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI just want to witness one step aerobics class at this gym, just to see what kind of music alt-right people listen to while exercising. What do they play in Spin class when Beyonc\u00e9 tunes are verboten? Macklemore? Green Day? Is it even legal to do burpees to an Adele song?\n\nWith too many alt-right ties to name or break down, every piece of literature or social media surrounding the white workout haven is replete with alt-right catchphrases and Nordic, pagan-worship imagery advocated by skinheads and neo-Nazis. Vengeance says its philosophy is: \u201cThe elite all do certain things in common. Only the inferior strive for equality.\u201d (Emphasis theirs.) The website adds:\n\nThis is not for those worried about \u201cmicro-aggressions\u201d, or who hold the white flag of \u201ctrigger warnings\u201d. We do not gather around holding hands, accepting one another\u2019s weakness to be \u201cnice\u201d. Vengeance is designed to be confrontational in order to drive individuals to greater and greater risk, trial and reward. This is strength worship. Those who remain willfully weak in body and mind will not be tolerated. Membership at Vengeance is a privilege. We call upon our internal destructive power to change our world. Instead of becoming victims to life\u2019s circumstances, join the rebellion against the world\u2019s complacency and sloth. Take the Profane Oath to do battle against that force which degrades humankind into the disgusting, diseased, incapable, grey masses that you see before yourself. We leave no revenge up to the slavery of a god that does not exist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI don\u2019t know what any of that means, and it sounds like a high-soprano, racist dog whistle, but it also makes me want to go to the gym. What are these motherfuckers talking about? It is reminiscent of the rhetoric SS officers would scream to the new arrivals at Third Reich death camps or a speech blasting from the cassette deck of a Nissan Sentra carrying four skinheads smoking weed, drinking Jameson straight out of the bottle, on the way to commit a hate crime.\n\nThe gym\u2019s founder, Sky Lemyng, is also a supporter of Operation Werewolf and the Wolves of Vinland\u2014another fitness/white power/Nordic \u201ctribe\u201d started by Paul Waggener, a former white power metal-band member who started his own motorcycle gang/skinhead cult.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe group gets its name from the guerrilla German resistance force organized by Adolf Hitler, and it is ... well .... It\u2019s a little hard to describe the WoV, but imagine if the Sons of Anarchy were a little more white supremacy-ish, did CrossFit and occasionally spent their spare time setting fire to black churches. (No, really. They actually do all of that. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s part of their training regimen, but there\u2019s this:)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be fair, when Lemyng was asked about his gym\u2019s ties to white supremacy and the Wolves of Vinland, he replied, \u201cThis business doesn\u2019t have ties to our personal lives. I think the controversial claims made against the WoV ultimately come from a place of ignorance, fear and bigotry. Vengeance is comprised of an eclectic group of people who support many different ideals.\u201d\n\nLemyng added:\n\nJust FYI, I think any kind of hatred towards an individual or a group of people based on their appearance, nationality, color, sex, religion or orientation stems from a place of weakness. At Vengeance, we violently pursue the cultivation of strength on all levels. Weakness, such as the aforementioned flavor of thereof, is the only thing which is not tolerated here. You\u2019re welcome.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s a pro tip to Sky Lemyng: When you add the \u201cbased on their ... \u201d part, it negates everything you said before it.\n\nThere are some, however, who dispute that Lemyng is a white supremacist. When the Nashville Scene pointed out that it couldn\u2019t find a nonwhite person in any of Vengeance Strength\u2019s Facebook photos, a man who said he is \u201cfull-blooded Chinese\u201d and a woman who said she is Native American pointed themselves out in one photo. One black woman also declared that Lemyng was \u201cclearly not a white supremacist\u201d because she dated him for two years.\n\nSo that clears everything up.\n\nExcept for this \u201clife rune\u201d tattoo he prominently displays on his chest:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSites from as far left as the Southern Poverty Law Center to the white nationalist Wikipedia, Stormfront, identify Lemyng\u2019s chest tattoo as a skinhead symbol. It appears on the flag of numerous white supremacist organizations, including the Volksfront flag (SPLC only lists 22 variations of the rune symbol).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, about my gym membership. I really do want to visit this place\u2014and not just because I want to wait until someone needs a spotter and then drop barbells on their neck. I find white people like this fascinating.\n\nI don\u2019t care anything about whether Caucasians have a superior method for doing sit-ups or Lemyng\u2019s fetishization of pagan, nationalist, Nordic, Nazi worship. But I\u2019ve always been intrigued by people who fall for bullshit sales pitches like this\u2014whether it\u2019s white people willing to pay $399 per month (the cost of membership) so they won\u2019t have to do chin-ups on bars that have been touched by Negro fingers or poor Southerners and Midwesterners who thought that a six-time bankrupt, vagina-grabbing, trust-fund, pseudo-billionaire, bronzer-addicted sociopath would rescue them from poverty.\n\nThe Nashville Scene did not speak to the other owner of Vengeance because he was on an out-of-town trip with the founders of the Wolves of Vinland.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWatch the Fox News 17 video below:\n\n", "keywords": ["know", "vengeance", "group", "white", "supremacist", "strength", "tenn", "membership", "nashville", "theres", "black", "lemyng", "apparently", "gym"], "polarity": 0.05307300409341226, "subjectivity": 0.4388377212356804},

Readers roundly rejected that portrait\u2014criticizing the piece for \u201cnormalizing\u201d white nationalist and neo-Nazi beliefs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Times says that wasn\u2019t its intention.\n\n\u201cThe point of the story was not to normalize anything,\u201d the Times\u2019 Marc Lacey wrote, \u201cbut to describe the degree to which hate and extremism have become far more normal in American life than many of us want to think.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut this explanation raises the question: Who, exactly, is the \u201cus\u201d the paper is referring to? Black people and people of color have long been aware of the reach and prevalence of American hatred.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere is one typical description of Hovater from the Times:\n\nMost Americans would be disgusted and baffled by his casually approving remarks about Hitler, disdain for democracy and belief that the races are better off separate. But his tattoos are innocuous pop-culture references: a slice of cherry pie adorns one arm, a homage to the TV show Twin Peaks. He says he prefers to spread the gospel of white nationalism with satire. He is a big Seinfeld fan.\n\nThe \u201cbut\u201d implies that the latter somehow contradicts the former: that Americans will be surprised that a virulent, unrepentant racist would watch popular TV shows and eat pie. The article also lauds Hovater\u2019s Midwestern manners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is the sort of construct, the sort of paragraph, the sort of article written primarily for white Americans, from a distinctly white American perspective.\n\nHovater is allowed the space to claim that he is not racist, without Fausset once acknowledging that many avowed white nationalists and white supremacists reject being called racist (rendering their views on their own racism effectively meaningless).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHovater\u2019s \u201cpolitical evolution,\u201d originating from \u201cvaguely leftist rock musician to ardent libertarian to fascist activist,\u201d is similarly unaddressed. Fausset doesn\u2019t push back at all.\n\nNor does Fausset mention that white nationalists\u2019 foundational views\u2014that white people are under attack in the U.S., for instance\u2014were held by more than a third of respondents in a recent University of Virginia poll (the proportion is closer to 50 percent when you look at just white respondents). If Americans reject white nationalists by label, they don\u2019t necessarily reject white nationalist ideas.\n\nThese are among the New York Times piece\u2019s many failures\u2014the greatest of which is its very premise: that white supremacy is adhered to by a fringe element of American society.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhite supremacy is foundational to the U.S., just as it is foundational to Hovater\u2019s neo-Nazi beliefs (a section about Hovater\u2019s reaction to Trayvon Martin\u2019s death and his staunch support of Trayvon\u2019s killer, George Zimmerman, is telling).\n\nIt\u2019s as American as the pie tattooed on Hovater\u2019s arm. Any serious analysis of white supremacists or white nationalists that fails to acknowledge this at the outset is doomed to fail. And this failure is evident in Fausset\u2019s tone and reporting: treating Hovater and his ilk as if they\u2014the polite racist, the mild-mannered Nazi\u2014are some novel phenomenon. The title could well have been \u201cNazis! They Are Just Like Us!\u201d (The \u201cus\u201d is, of course, white, as the \u201cus\u201d so often is with the Times.)\n\n\n\nBlack and brown people can ill afford that sort of na\u00efvet\u00e9 about mild-mannered white people. Mother Jones\u2019 Shane Bauer, cited in the Times\u2019 response to its readers, misses this point when he defends the piece.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPeople mad about this article want to believe that Nazis are monsters we cannot relate to. White supremacists are normal ass white people and it\u2019s been that way in America since 1776. We will continue to be in trouble till we understand that,\u201d Bauer tweeted.\n\nBlack people and people of color know most intimately the monsters that lie in \u201cnormal ass white people.\u201d It\u2019s something I think about every time I look at the photos of white people, their faces contorted in anger, screaming insults and slurs at little black children going to school during the first wave of school integration. Those white people sat in church on Sundays and prepared their kids\u2019 lunches on Mondays. Ask their white neighbors, their nieces and nephews, about them, and you\u2019d likely hear stories about how kind and polite they were. How they volunteered. How they loved cherry pie and could always be relied on for a favor.\n\nWhite America has no difficulty seeing the deep-down goodness of racists\u2014white supremacy could not exist without an insistence on white virtue and white innocence.

Christine Fair, an associate professor at Georgetown University\u2019s School of Foreign Service, was getting her workout in at Old Town Sport&Health Wednesday when she recognized Satan\u2019s spawn, who is also the president of the white nationalist National Policy Institute.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFair wrote in a Tumblr post that when she approached Spencer asking if he was in fact who she thought he was, the coward denied it.\n\n\u201cAre you Richard Spencer?\u201d she said she asked.\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d the white nationalist fuqboi responded, Fair wrote.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Of course you are, so not only are you a Nazi\u2014you are a cowardly Nazi,\u2019\u201d Fair told the Post. \u201c\u2018I just want to say to you, I\u2019m sick of your crap that this country belongs [to people like you]. ... As a woman, I find your statements to be particularly odious; moreover, I find your presence in this gym to be unacceptable, your presence in this town to be unacceptable.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the Post notes, Spencer has denied being a Nazi, although after Donald Trump somehow snagged the presidency, Spencer addressed an \u201calt-right\u201d conference where people in the crowd were seen making Nazi salutes as Spencer cheered, \u201cHail Trump! Hail our people! Hail our victory.\u201d\n\nBuzzFeed also reports that according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, Spencer has also called for the \u201cpeaceful ethnic cleansing of nonwhite Americans.\u201d\n\nFair wrote in her post that most of the employees at the gym were \u201cwomen and/or old people of color,\u201d who Spencer has \u201crepeated[ly] asserted ... to be inferior to his kind who are entitled to rule over us because we are not christian, white or have a vagina.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn my book, this is a clear case of a hostile environment being perpetrated by the general manager, who is an indifferent, asinine white feller who demanded that I remove my \u2018Puck Trump\u2019 hat a few weeks back while asserting the \u2018right\u2019 of this Nazi to join our gym some two months ago. Priorities anyone?\u201d Fair continued in her post.\n\nOn Thursday, Fair tweeted out that Spencer had been \u201cousted\u201d from the gym.\n\nSpencer says he is feeling rather upset about the whole thing, insisting that he was a \u201cmodel gym-goer\u201d and just wanted to get his workout done.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t bother anyone. I don\u2019t talk to anyone. I really just go and lift weights,\u201d he told BuzzFeed.\n\nHe said he was at the gym \u201cpeacefully working out\u201d when Fair came up and started asking him if he was Richard Spencer.\n\n\u201cI said no because I wanted her to go away,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want a confrontation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t come to the gym to do politics. But she started screeching and yelling all this stuff,\u201d Spencer added, saying that other patrons asked her to stop.\n\nHe added that Fair told him, \u201c\u2018You\u2019re evil, you\u2019re terrible, you\u2019re oppressing people at the gym,\u2019 which is just ridiculous.\u201d\n\nPoor guy.\n\nSpencer said it was unfair for him to be barred from the gym when he had \u201cfollowed all the rules\u201d and was \u201cwell-behaved\u201d while Fair made \u201cthis huge scene and annoyed everyone.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said the manager asked Fair to \u201ccut it out\u201d and told her to leave about 10 minutes into the confrontation, while he was allowed to finish up his workout.\n\nSpencer said the gym might have been fearful of \u201cnegative publicity\u201d after Fair \u201cmade it into a cause of some sort.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been talking to a couple of people about this.

We recognize that we have created this confusion and need to resolve it. We have paused all general verifications while we work and will report back soon.\u201d\n\nFirst of all, Anil Dash already said that Wednesday night. It looks as if all Twitter did was take Dash\u2019s tweet, reword it and send it out to make it look as if the platform has had some deep and profound epiphany. It hasn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cAlso verification is still deliberately being used to conflate \u2018this person is who they say they are\u2019 with \u2018this person has higher status,\u2019\u201d Dash wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd that is the key. Twitter has used the verification system as described purposely. There\u2019s a reason people\u2014folks with legitimate reasons to be verified\u2014have to go through hell and high water to get that blue check mark. Twitter has wielded verification like a weapon and held it over people\u2019s heads as something they should aspire to or go to great lengths to achieve. This has been purposeful and intentional, and everyone knows it.\n\nSo when Twitter then tries to come back and act as if it is just realizing this is a problem, it is disingenuous at best, and a purposeful deflection from the real issue at worst.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe fact remains that, verified or not, Jason Kessler should not have an account at all, considering the Confederate-flag (hate symbol) imagery in his header, but I\u2019ll come back to that.\n\nJack Dorsey added on to the Twitter Support tweet and said, \u201cWe should\u2019ve communicated faster on this (yesterday): our agents have been following our verification policy correctly, but we realized some time ago the system is broken and needs to be reconsidered. And we failed by not doing anything about it. Working now to fix faster.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOK, Jack.\n\nYes, the verification system is \u201cbroken.\u201d And yes, it needs to be fixed, but there is a greater issue here.\n\nYou promised us weeks ago that the platform was going to take a more aggressive stance against hate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is not just about Jason Kessler being verified. This is about Jason Kessler having an account that is clearly violating the rules that you claimed were going to be enforced more strictly, and about that account going through a verification process that actually puts human eyes at your company on his account\u2014and those human eyes saying, \u201cYes, let\u2019s elevate his platform with this blue checkmark.\u201d\n\nYour company admittedly created this verification pecking order, and your company has done everything to keep it in place.\n\nIt does not go unnoticed that your responses Thursday come after many, many people retweeted my post and my tweet thread and added you to the thread to draw your attention to it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou were able to easily ignore the pieces written by other outlets, but you could not ignore mine because it got a lot of traction on social media, and your hand was forced.\n\nSo you come out with this fake-ass \u201cmea culpa,\u201d and we are all supposed to applaud your supposed epiphany, but here\u2019s the thing: You guys say this about everything you get called out on. You said it on Oct. 13 when you got called out on the harassment-and-abuse issue. Your promised big changes.\n\nNothing has changed. It\u2019s business as usual on Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou guys pussyfoot around every single issue that is brought to your attention, pretend to be contrite, then ultimately do nothing. This is the Twitter way.\n\nThe other day, I called your attention to someone who was harassing me on Twitter. I blocked the original account from which the person tweeted to me, and the person used a second account to continue the harassment. This is something I brought up in the post I wrote about the harassment problem.\n\nI openly asked for your help, and you ignored that call to duty.\n\nYou couldn\u2019t ignore this one, though.\n\nAnd you won\u2019t be able to ignore any further callouts because this is real.\n\nYou have created a monster, and it is time for you to either tame the beast or slay it altogether.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYour move, my guy.\n\nEarlier:\n\nI\u2019ve decided it\u2019s going to be my personal and public crusade to air out Twitter every time it does something that runs counter to what it claims to be about. The platform\u2019s made a big deal recently about how much stricter it\u2019s going to be about enforcing its rules of terms of service, and we\u2019ve all seen Twitter do everything but that. This latest example is no exception.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the \u201cnew\u201d rules Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey outlined in his Oct. 13 tweet thread was a more aggressive stance against \u201chate symbols\u201d and \u201cviolent groups.\u201d How is it, then, that Twitter verified the account of the white nationalist who organized the rally in Charlottesville, Va.\u2014especially when said white nationalist has as his header photo the No. 1 image associated with white racism and hate: the Confederate flag?\n\nJason Kessler tweets under the handle @TheMadDimension. His bio says he is a freelance writer who has written for GotNews, Daily Caller and VDARE. He also identifies himself as the organizer of the Unite the Right rally, aka the Charlottesville riot that ended with the death of Heather Heyer, a counterprotester who was killed when one of Kessler\u2019s many followers plowed a vehicle into a crowd of people who had beliefs that differed from his own.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKessler bragged on Twitter on Tuesday that his account had \u201cfinally\u201d been verified, which indicates that he applied for the privilege, and someone at Twitter reviewed his account and his credentials and determined that, yes, he should be given the credibility of a blue check mark by his name.\n\n\u201cLooks like I FINALLY got verified by Twitter,\u201d Kessler wrote. \u201cI must be the only working class white advocate with that distinction.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center lists Kessler as an \u201cextremist\u201d with a white nationalist ideology; he is included on the SPLC Hatewatch website.\n\nAccording to SPLC, Kessler attempted to unseat Charlottesville\u2019s only black city councilman\u2014Vice Mayor Wes Bellamy\u2014and served as a bridge between a Virginia gubernatorial candidate and the \u201calt-right.\u201d He is described as \u201crelying on the familiar tropes of \u2018white genocide\u2019 and \u2018demographic displacement.\u2019\u201d\n\nHere is an especially interesting tidbit from SPLC\u2019s dossier on Kessler:\n\nRumors abound on white nationalist forums that Kessler\u2019s ideological pedigree before 2016 was less than pure and seem to point to involvement in the Occupy movement and past support for President Obama. At one recent speech in favor of Charlottesville\u2019s status as a sanctuary city, Kessler live-streamed himself as an attendee questioned him and apologized for an undisclosed spat during Kessler\u2019s apparent involvement with Occupy. Kessler appeared visibly perturbed by the woman\u2019s presence and reminders of their past association.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKessler claims that he was radicalized after public relations exec Justine Sacco was fired for making an extremely tasteless and racist joke about AIDS in Africa in late 2013. (Sidenote: Remember the #HasJustineLandedYet hashtag? Good. Fucking. Times. That was really the golden age of Twitter, I swear.)\n\nKessler said of the Sacco incident, \u201c ... so it was a little racist joke, nothing that big of a deal, she didn\u2019t have that many followers, she probably didn\u2019t think anybody was going to see it.\u201d\n\nIn December 2016, Kessler wrote a post titled, \u201cThe End of Identity Politics: To Ensure Peace, Prepare for War,\u201d in which he said:\n\nBut make no mistake, the age of innocence is over for whites politically. We are becoming a displaced minority in our own country thanks to Democrat policies. They tax the hell out of middle class families who might want to have more children while paying for welfare queens to have 5 or 6 babies they can\u2019t support. They provide sanctuary cities for illegal immigrants who flood in from south of the border and import Islamists from the most dangerous countries on Earth. The time for supplication is over. We need to fight back!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwitter just validated everything this man has to say by giving him that blue check mark after his name.\n\nBut Twitter is taking a more aggressive stance against hate and violence, right?\n\nRight.\n\nTwitter is directly enabling white supremacy and white nationalist ideology.\n\nTwitter is full of shit.", "keywords": ["account", "verify", "fix", "nationalist", "going", "white", "person", "broken", "support", "oops", "system", "verification", "itsoon", "kessler", "twitter", "verified", "accidentally"], "polarity": 0.04275498891352549, "subjectivity": 0.41693203815155033},

In exchange for successfully completing the program, participants can often get a reduced sentence or have charges dismissed entirely. The city of Buffalo, N.Y., has a new experimental drug-court program aimed specifically at opioid addicts.\n\nNPR reports that the Buffalo program, which is overseen by Judge Craig Hannah, is the first of its kind in the country. Opiate Crisis Intervention Court prioritizes treatment over criminal prosecution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cRight now we\u2019re trying to save them. I\u2019m trying to save their life,\u201d Hannah told NPR. \u201cI want them to have another sunset, another time with their family, to see another Christmas.\u201d\n\nHannah\u2019s program differs from other drug-court programs in that if a defendant expresses a desire to get help in kicking his or her opioid or heroin addiction, the court defers adjudication in the case in order to make this happen.\n\n\u201cRight from arraignment, we put the clock on hold. We turn off the court reporter, everything\u2019s off the record, and we\u2019re talking about getting you help,\u201d Hannah said. \u201cAnd once we get you help and get you stabilized, we put the criminal case back on the calendar.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile treatment is also a component of traditional drug-court programs, it often take weeks or longer to get the defendant enrolled in an inpatient treatment or detox program that could help them get sober.\n\nBecause a delay in treatment can prove fatal for those addicted to opioids, time is of the essence.\n\nNPR reports that Erie County, which includes Buffalo, is on track to have the highest opiate-overdose death total in its history. The county averages just over one overdose per day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJohn Flynn, the district attorney for Erie County, told NPR: \u201cWe couldn\u2019t wait three or four weeks until we got the individuals into a treatment program or plan. Because they didn\u2019t get it right away, they were going back out in the streets, shooting up fentanyl and dying.\u201d\n\nIn Hannah\u2019s program, participants go through 30 days of inpatient detox followed by 30 days of outpatient treatment. They have to appear in Hannah\u2019s courtroom at 11 a.m. each weekday to check in with him and have a one-on-one talk. If they fail to show up for that 11 a.m. check-in, Hannah issues a warrant for their arrest.\n\nThe program also includes regular, random drug testing and an 8 p.m. nightly curfew, when participants have to check in with a court staffer and let them know their location.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne-on-one and group counseling is also part of the program.\n\nHannah\u2019s program was created in May with a $300,000 grant from the U.S. Justice Department. While it is too soon to draw conclusions about its success, the preliminary numbers show that it may be onto something.\n\nOf the roughly 140 defendants who have participated in the program so far, only four have washed out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth the National Association of Drug Court Professionals and the Bureau of Justice see the program as promising, especially the immediate-treatment aspect of it.\n\nChristopher Deutsch, who is with NADCP, told NPR, \u201cThis fast-tracking is really unique and generating a lot of interest out there.\u201d\n\nBureau of Justice policy adviser Gregory Torain agreed: \u201cThat\u2019s a big piece of it. That\u2019s very new.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the meantime, Judge Hannah is acting as a champion and a cheerleader for everyone who comes through his program.\n\nHe told NPR: \u201cI always tell everyone, we play by Vegas rules: What happens here stays here. You tell me what\u2019s happening, we\u2019re not going to charge you with new charges. We\u2019re going to give you the help that you need, because we know that this is an addiction.\n\n\u201cBut we can\u2019t help you,\u201d Hannah added, \u201cuntil you\u2019re honest with yourself.\u201d\n\nRead more at NPR.", "keywords": ["told", "treatment", "hannah", "drugcourt", "justice", "program", "participants", "help", "drug", "crisis", "intervention", "dying", "stop", "court", "kind", "opioid", "looking", "npr"], "polarity": 0.07387218045112783, "subjectivity": 0.5057210333526122},

The level of bureaucracy and red tape that exists when a large company like Pepsi attempts to do anything creative is almost Kafkaesque. You're not just grabbing a camera, calling a Kardashian, and asking everyone currently in line at Zara to be in the commercial. It has to go through dozens of edits and rewrites and reshoots, has to be vetted by dozens of lawyers, and has to be signed off on by dozens of different departments.

Both Mara and Diaz admitted to their crimes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe two former deputies \u201cquietly\u201d made plea agreements with federal prosecutors that were not announced to the public, Bakersfield.com reported in May. They agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute marijuana.\n\nThey both faced a maximum of five years in prison each, a fine of $250,000 each and a minimum of two years of supervised release, along with other penalties. They pleaded guilty in federal court May 15. From a previous Bakersfield.com report:\n\nThe two deputies \u201cabused\u201d their positions of trust and authority, the plea agreement states, \u201cto take for unlawful personal gain marijuana plants from KCSO property that had been seized in the course of \u2026 marijuana eradication operations. \u201cOn or about September 19, 2014, in furtherance of this conspiracy, Penney and KCSO Deputy August used their KCSO-issued keys to gain access\u201d to the department\u2019s marijuana storage unit. They admitted to cutting the tops off plants and placing them in trash bags. The stolen pot was stored at Penney\u2019s home until another co-conspirator retrieved the stolen pot, and with the knowledge of the deputies, trimmed the crop into usable marijuana, according to the documents. The pot\u2014about 8 pounds worth of salable material\u2014was then returned on multiple occasions to Penney. The deputy then delivered the product over a period of time to August, who provided it to an individual who had previously worked for him as a confidential informant. That individual sold the weed and shared the profits with August, who then shared the money with Penney.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Bakersfield.com, they could be subject to asset forfeiture if their property is determined to be the fruit of ill-gotten gains.\n\n\n\n(Gonna guess that last thing doesn\u2019t happen, though.)\n\nThe case against the two officers was a result of a joint investigation by the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Bakersfield Police Department with assistance from the Kern County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProsecutors recommended a sentence of nine months in prison for August, who they saw as being guiltier and more heavily involved in the operation than Penney. In their sentencing memorandum, they wrote that they felt the sentence was appropriate in part \u201cbecause the need to deter police corruption of this kind is of paramount importance.\u201d\n\nBakersfield.com reports that the prosecutors said, \u201cDefendant\u2019s actions were motivated by greed, and he committed these crimes repeatedly over a nine-month period. His conduct has tarnished the reputation of the KCSO.\u201d\n\nFor Penney, prosecutors simply recommended probation because there was no evidence of his criminal activity beyond his one-time theft of marijuana from the evidence locker, and also because he was the first to admit his crimes to the authorities. He also convinced August and Mara to come clean as well, according to the report.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere also was a lot of dramatic testimony at the sentencing hearing from people like August\u2019s younger sister and his wife.\n\nPenney did not have anyone speak on his behalf, but he apologized for breaking his oath to uphold the law and protect the community.\n\nI imagine there are a great many wives and girlfriends who have stood by their men during a drug investigation and trial.

Because if they\u2019re not fringe, if they\u2019re actually everywhere, then ... fuck.\n\nUnfortunately, \u201cthen ... fuck\u201d is the reality. The men and women who marched last night, chanting and hashtagging #unitetheright, and the men and women in Charlottesville today, are not fringe. They are not unique. Perhaps they exist in the crevices and butt cracks, but they\u2019re in the coffeeshops and boardrooms too. They are your neighbors. Our neighbors. My neighbors. They\u2019re schoolteachers and Little League baseball coaches; bartenders and accountants; architects and marketing directors; registered nurses and police officers. They wait on your tables, they answer the phones when you call tech support, they fly your planes when you travel to Phoenix, they deliver your UPS packages and leave notes when you\u2019re not there, and they perform surgeries on your broken limbs.\n\nAnd for the white people who believe they\u2019ve done enough, who believe their hands are washed, they\u2019re at your kitchen tables and happy hours and BBQs and weddings. They\u2019re in your families. They\u2019re on your couches. They\u2019re on your T-Mobile family plans. They\u2019re in your beds.\n\nThere were enough of them to elect Donald Trump, enough of them to applaud and support the ascension of Steve Bannon and the appointment of Jeff Sessions. Enough white men and women so dead set on retaining whichever privileges they believe to be their white birthrights that they\u2019d rather there not be an Earth than exist without that status.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey are everywhere.", "keywords": ["men", "fringe", "women", "white", "unique", "theyve", "theyre", "believe", "theres", "exist", "neighbors"], "polarity": 0.08541666666666667, "subjectivity": 0.48750000000000004},

It was a triumph as epic as the film itself. But Panther isn\u2019t the only black-helmed film being released by Disney this winter; we are now only two weeks away from the release of A Wrinkle in Time, directed by Ava DuVernay.\n\nFeaturing Oprah, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Mindy Kaling, Reese Witherspoon and Chris Pine and starring newcomer Storm Reid as young heroine Meg Murry, A Wrinkle in Time is certain to serve up its own brand of black girl movie magic on March 9. And along with all of you avid filmgoers, we especially think our girls should be there to see it.\n\nEnter the \u201cA Wrinkle in Time Challenge\u201d (#AWITChallenge): an initiative to buy out eight theaters in cities around the country\u2014Austin, Texas; Charlotte, N.C.; Chicago; Greensboro, N.C.; Houston; Philadelphia; Plainfield, N.J.; and Washington, D.C.\u2014for black girls (and nonboys) to see the film on opening weekend.\n\nCoordinated by the online group Sisters in the Storm, \u201ca collective of black women focused on community engagement and Sisterhood among black women & non-men,\u201d a GoFundMe page has been created with the aim of raising $25,000, reaching nearly half their goal in the past 10 days, with just under a week left to go. But behind their valiant mission is a heartbreaking story, as co-founder Sherronda J. Brown explains in an essay at Medium:\n\nIn late January, a black girl named Stormiyah Denson-Jackson passed away in an apparent suicide at the public boarding school she attended. She was twelve years old and already madly in love with math and science\u2014a #RealMeg. But this love she had made her the target of bullying and verbal abuse from her classmates. Devastated by their taunts, she chose to end her life rather than live with the shame they tried to make her feel for being a \u201cnerd\u201d who enjoyed engaging with sciences and mathematics. There is a narrow image of blackness in the social imagination, mired with stereotypes and white ascendant ideals about black intellect, capability, and mobility. For black women and girls, beliefs, about our blackness\u2014how it is allowed to look, what it is allowed to achieve\u2014can never be divorced from beliefs about our gender. There is a social stigma about challenging these expectations and permissions, and it constantly impacts our experiences in the world, but never more significantly than when we are growing up, learning who we are, and deciding who we want to become.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike the momentum that grew around the #BlackPantherChallenge, raising over $620,000 from all 50 states to make it possible for black children to see themselves reflected on film, Sisters of the Storm\u2019s act of love and generosity is inspiring others to do the same for the #AWITChallenge. For instance, writer and Lemonade Syllabus creator Candice Benbow has set her own goal to make A Wrinkle in Time accessible to 200 girls in Hamilton, N.J. As she told The Glow Up, it\u2019s a gift she hopes to make in memory of her mother:\n\nI wanted to ensure that we do our part to support Ava and this film just like we supported Ryan Coogler and Black Panther. But also, my mom took me to the library every Friday, and would take me to the movies whenever something came out for kids. This movie and the moment around it reminds me of my childhood and time with my mother. I wanted to honor that by participating in this challenge so black girls today can look back on similar memories and smile. What Ava has done with this film made history, and black girls need to see that there is no dream too big for them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe have seen firsthand the impact that seeing black superheroes on film can have on our children\u2014and ourselves. With A Wrinkle in Time, we also have yet another opportunity\u2014and plenty of incentive\u2014to show Hollywood that blockbusters star black people, too.\n\nBut for real-life Meg Murrys, or Shuris, or other struggling Stormiyah Denson-Jacksons, A Wrinkle in Time may also provide exactly the affirmation and inspiration they need to flourish as their brilliant, STEM-loving, \u201cblack girl nerd\u201d selves. As Brown wrote: \u201cSeeing ourselves represented as heroes has undeniable power, and feeling our absence in these roles also influences the way that we see ourselves and our blackness.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s do it again, y\u2019all.\n\nThe Glow Up tip: A Wrinkle in Time opens in theaters on Friday, March 9. You can support Sisters in the Storm\u2019s $25,000 #AWITChallenge via its GoFundMe page until March 1. You can also spend $20 to sponsor a black girl to see the film in Hamilton, N.J., via Candice Benbow\u2019s website. Or begin your own challenge locally.

[Deputy Attorney General Rod J.] Rosenstein said that the department is adding safeguards to ensure that police have sufficient evidence of criminal activity when property is seized. Property owners will receive notice of their rights within 45 days, which is twice as quickly as required by current law. Law enforcement agencies will be required to provide officers with more training on asset forfeiture laws, he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCurrently, there are 13 states that have laws that require a conviction before an individual\u2019s property can be seized, but under federal law, a person\u2019s home, cash, vehicles and any other property can be taken without their having even been charged with a crime.\n\nNot only can local authorities take your property, but they also get to take up to 80 percent of the property for themselves and just give federal agencies a cut of up to 20 percent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSounds very profitable for local and federal law enforcement agencies, doesn\u2019t it?\n\nThere is evidence that forfeiture efforts tend to target poor neighborhoods, and although defenders of the practice claim it is necessary to disrupt major criminal organizations, a 2015 report from the Institute for Justice (pdf) showed that between 1997 and 2013, 87 percent of Justice Department forfeitures did not require a criminal charge or conviction.\n\nAdditionally, after Holder stopped adoptive forfeiture in 2015, forfeiture revenues under the adoptive program dropped from $65 million to just $15,000 the following year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKanya Bennett, legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, told the Post that the new policy is \u201coutrageous\u201d and likened it to \u201cpolicing for profit.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are talking about people who have not been convicted of a crime and are often not given a day in court to reclaim their possessions,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cCivil asset forfeiture is tantamount to policing for profit, generating millions of dollars annually that the agencies get to keep.\u201d\n\nSessions defended the policy Wednesday at a meeting with representatives from the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Sheriffs\u2019 Association, the Major Cities Chiefs Association and other law enforcement officials who back the new policy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cCivil asset forfeiture is a key tool that helps law enforcement defund organized crime, take back ill-gotten gains and prevent new crimes from being committed, and it weakens the criminals and the cartels,\u201d Sessions said.\n\nBennett disagreed with that.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that we are not talking about criminals,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cWe are talking about Americans who have had their homes, cars, money and other property taken through civil forfeiture, which requires only mere suspicion that the property is connected to a crime.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at the Washington Post here and here.", "keywords": ["crime", "forfeiture", "seize", "convicted", "program", "havent", "federal", "local", "assets", "talking", "jeff", "law", "state", "agencies", "easier", "sessions", "property", "enforcement"], "polarity": -0.001396948205458841, "subjectivity": 0.40328282828282835},

The FBI was like, \u201cNobody can screw up worse than this,\u201d and PepsiCo was like, \u201cHold my beer!\u201d\n\nIn an astonishingly offensive move, Pepsi cast Kendall Jenner in an ad that co-opts the resistance movement to sell soda. Not only does it co-opt the movement, but the commercial centers Jenner, a white woman, and police as the focal points in images of people protesting whatever it is they\u2019re protesting in a commercial for Pepsi.\n\nThe ad starts out innocuously enough. Jenner is at a photo shoot, apparently oblivious to the streets full of people just outside. Images of protesters of all colors move across the screen. We see a woman in a hijab, several musicians playing their instruments and a man standing on his balcony watching the movement.\n\nSuddenly Jenner becomes aware of what is going on. One head nod of encouragement from an Asian man later, and she takes off her platinum-blond wig; hands it to one of only two black women we will see on the fringes of this ad; wipes the lipstick off her mouth; and moves into the crowd of people, smiling, bouncy and being a Kardashian-Jenner.\n\nEveryone is laughing and grinning, dancing and jigging and partying it up, because what is resistance but one big party\u2014AMIRITE?!\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the outskirts of the crowd, Jenner spots a group of policemen, lined up in front of the protesters. Notably, they aren\u2019t wearing the militarized riot gear we\u2019ve become used to seeing in scenes from protests.\n\nKendall boldly walks up to one of the police officers and tentatively hands him a Pepsi. There\u2019s a pause of anticipation as everyone waits to see what happens.\n\nHe opens the Pepsi and drinks it. THE CROWD GOES WILD. Everyone cheers! We\u2019ve solved all of our problems with a fucking can of Pepsi.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, let me just run down for you the problems I have with the imagery of this commercial.\n\nKendall Jenner. I had always thought of her as an outlier in her family, one who didn\u2019t necessarily insert herself into things that are above her melanin level, unlike her attention-whore sisters. This, however, goes beyond the pale.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou center Kendall Jenner in a whitewashed protest, because let\u2019s be honest: The crowd at the protest is looking pretty light, too, save for the few light-skinned black dudes and the nonthreatening Asians thrown in here and there. What exactly are they protesting? Price hikes at Starbucks?\n\nGIF\n\nNext, lily-white Jenner taking her wig off and handing it to a black woman. Peak whiteness. \u201cHere, girl. Hold my wig,\u201d as if the only role a black woman could play in this commercial is one of servitude.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd really, where are the black women? Black women have been leading the charge in the resistance movement since day one. How is it that in a commercial based on protest, the only two black women we see are relegated to the background, so far out of the shot as to almost be hidden from view?\n\nBecause in case you didn\u2019t know, when Jenner walks up and \u201cfaces off\u201d against the cops before handing one her Pepsi? That imagery is completely ripped off from a black woman who didn\u2019t have the privilege of whiteness to stop the cops from pointing their guns at her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey quite literally exploit the imagery of Ieshia Evans to sell soda. Ain\u2019t that some shit?\n\nAnd finally, handing a Pepsi to a cop and telling him to \u201clive bolder\u201d\u2014what exactly is Pepsi trying to say here? Is it encouraging cops to \u201clive bolder\u201d as they continue to kill unarmed black people in the street?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAre we supposed to be moved because Jenner, in all her whiteness, was \u201cbrave\u201d enough to walk up to a cop and confront him with her can of soda?\n\nI\u2019m not here for this shit, and Twitter wasn\u2019t, either.

It is a futile attempt at relevancy. It is knowing that they don\u2019t have a redeeming quality in their pitiful bags of meat and bones, so they invent one out of thin air.

Chris Brown songs are all about that action at this point with no attempt at romance, subtlety or pretense. You want a song about drugs, sex and R&B gangbanging (of the Blood or Crip variety, though I suppose of the Bang Bros variety, too) that doesn\u2019t look to make any woman feel special? Well, Chris Brown is your guy. In that case, a \u201cu up\u201d text and a Chris Brown song are the same shit.

The ancient Mayans had theories, but so do the current Gucci gangers. It\u2019s all a mystery.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn my experiences, to white people, hooking up can mean literally anything from making out to filming a flick with 17 people present.

Ana, who \u201chooked up\u201d with her uncle by having dinner in his hotel suite.\n\n4. Do guys talk about this shit\u2014ya know, hooking up and shit?\n\nYep. We do, and it\u2019s just as confusing for us (even in older age). Aaron is wondering (read: concerned about) why Zoey hasn\u2019t answered his \u201cu up\u201d text, even doing that thing where you move your phone around constantly JUST in case you missed a text because your phone is in a dead spot. Every millimeter counts, and yes, that\u2019s what she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAaron tells Vivek that they messed around, which means making out to Aaron but not to Vivek, who thinks \u201cmessing around\u201d means some \u201ctop-shelf action,\u201d but Aaron informs him that if there was a little sloppy toppy, then he\u2019d have said they kicked it. My head almost exploded. And that was not a pun, even though it kind of is. Even if I didn\u2019t intend it.\n\n5. What\u2019s a nudie bank?\n\nVivek is the guy we all hate. Period. In the first episode, he says his father is a bum even though by his own explanation, his father seems like a great dude. Upping the self-absorbed ante, Vivek views nudes simply as pictures of his dong that he sends to women. He\u2019s more interested in the pictures of his wang than the pictures of women he receives, which is probably none, to the point where he\u2019s curating a library of his own dong pics, which he probably views at least twice a day. Aaron has to explain that a nudie bank is the pictures from OTHERS you\u2019ve received, not those that you\u2019ve taken of yourself. #Fax #Facts\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. Do chicks from the hood\u2014represented on Grown-ish by on-the-show twins Jaz and Sky\u2014watch Big Bang Theory?\n\nYes. Yes, they do, and to assume that they\u2019re stereotypically watching television shows like Basketball Wives is some racist-ass shit.\n\n7. How easy is it to spiral into an over-texting meltdown?\n\nCringeworthy-level easy. One of the funniest scenes in this episode is watching Zoey fall down the entirely one-sided texting rabbit hole with Aaron. She starts with her own \u201cu up\u201d text, coupled with the requisite IDC IDC IDC \u201cSorry that wasn\u2019t for you\u201d follow-up, ONLY to acknowledge that it was for him because really, she didn\u2019t want to him to think she was over him in case he might end up being over her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen we get to painfully watch as she tries to undo each previous text with a subsequent text that creates more ridiculousness, even getting to the point of talking about family diseases. The scene is PERFECTLY punctuated when Aaron sends the two words that not only run an alcohol-and-salt-dipped sword through your heart but also twist it: \u201cPlease stop.\u201d No extra caps. No exclamation points. Just simple, plain and painful. I cringed.\n\n8. Is Buffalo Wild Wings lit?\n\nAccording to Aaron, yes.\n\n9. Is it easy to be a player these days and juggle multiple people in a dating capacity?\n\nYes. Unless you are not built that way. Zoey is not built that way. At all. Most of us aren\u2019t. It\u2019s HARD work being a player, and if you have a heart to ANY degree, you will fail at some point. Also, Zoey is attempting to date two dudes who she keeps around her often. Also, technology can fuck up all of your shenanigans. #RookieMistakes\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. Is honesty the best policy?\n\nYes.

One set of laws for white people, one set of laws for people of color,\u201d Queens College professor Harry Levine, the author of the report, said in the Drug Policy Alliance press release.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2014, de Blasio ran for mayor on a progressive platform, which included reducing the so-called war on drugs that has been used as an institutionalized weapon to decimate swaths of black and brown communities.\n\n\n\nOn Nov. 10 of that year, he said the following:\n\nThere have been, in some cases, disastrous consequences for individuals and families. It hurts their chances to get a good job, to get housing. It hurts their chances to qualify for a student loan; it can literally follow them the rest of their lives. I think the fact that you will see fewer unnecessary arrests will be good for New York City as a whole. It will be good for New Yorkers of color and young people of color\u2014there is no question about that. We\u2019ll see how the numbers come out over time, but there\u2019s no doubt in my mind it will be a very substantial impact. And for a lot of young people it means they will not have this reality holding them back; a summons is not going to affect their future. An arrest, could. And we want to avoid that unnecessary burden.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat \u201cunnecessary burden\u201d has not been avoided; in fact, in the first three years of the de Blasio administration, the New York City Police Department made more than 60,000 criminal arrests for the lowest-level marijuana possession offense, according to the damning report.\n\nFurther, the NYPD has arrested black and Latino residents at astronomical rates. White people, per usual, prove that they have a monopoly on state-recognized freedom by presenting their \u201cGet out of jail free\u201d cards and skipping down boulevards lined with chalk outlining the bodies of our slain.\n\nDe Blasio\u2019s New York was supposed to be cleansed and sanitized of the filth that was Rudolph Giuliani, Michael Bloomberg, Ray Kelly, Bill Bratton and the state-sanctioned killers with badges they loved to protect and place on pedestals. Instead, de Blasio simply placed air freshener over the stench of decomposing dreams of justice while pointing to his brilliant, black feminist wife and accomplished children as proof that he was not like those other white men.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor those who didn\u2019t already know, \u201cUnjust and Unconstitutional\u201d proves that de Blasio is merely a fox among wolves, skinning and grinning for the benefit of those who want to believe that neoliberalism is the answer to the blatant, Klan-ish tactics that have become par for the course for the Republican Party.\n\nKey findings from the report include the following:\n\n\n\n\u00b7 In the first three years of the de Blasio administration, the NYPD made over 60,000 criminal arrests for the lowest-level marijuana possession offense, an average of 20,000 marijuana arrests a year.\n\n\u00b7 The NYPD\u2019s marijuana arrests under de Blasio suffer from the same overwhelming racial disparities as under Bloomberg\u2014about 86 percent of the arrests for marijuana possession are of blacks and Latinos. \u00b7 As in previous years, in 2016 and in the first four months of 2017, 81 percent of the people arrested for marijuana were age 16 to 34, 58 percent were 16 to 25 and 27 percent were age 16 to 20. \u00b7 Residents of New York City\u2019s public housing developments constitute the single largest group of people arrested. In 2016, NYPD housing police made 21 percent of the city\u2019s total of 18,121 arrests for marijuana possession and 92 percent of those arrested were blacks and Latinos. \u00b7 Of New York City\u2019s 76 neighborhood police precincts, 37 neighborhoods have a majority of black and Latino residents. They have about half the city\u2019s population but provide 66 percent of the marijuana possession arrests and 92 percent of the people arrested are blacks and Latinos. \u00b7 Police in New York also target neighborhoods in midtown and lower Manhattan with active nightlife. Although pedestrians in those areas are predominately white, police arrest blacks and Latinos at very high rates. \u00b7 In 2016, in Greenwich Village, 69 percent of the people arrested for marijuana possession were blacks and Latinos. In Chelsea, 77 percent were blacks and Latinos. In Soho-Tribeca-Wall Street, 73 percent were blacks and Latinos. In tourist-heavy Little Italy and Chinatown, 66 percent of the people arrested for marijuana possession were blacks and Latinos. \u00b7 In 2016, police enforcement targeted people of color, especially blacks, everywhere in New York City. In Manhattan, blacks are 13 percent of the residents but 45 percent of the people arrested for marijuana possession. In Queens, blacks are 18 percent of the residents but 49 percent of the people arrested for marijuana. And in Staten Island, blacks are 10 percent of the residents but 49 percent of the people arrested for marijuana possession. \u00b7 The rates of NYPD arrests for marijuana possession per 100,000 of the population are extremely skewed. In Queens, police arrest blacks at seven times the rate of whites. In Manhattan, they arrest blacks at 10 times the rate of whites. And in Staten Island, the NYPD arrests blacks at 15 times the rate of whites.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNew York\u2019s marijuana-arrest crusade has resulted in significant harms for those who are most vulnerable and has been used as a justification for the hyperpolicing of communities of color,\u201d said Kassandra Frederique, New York state director for the Drug Policy Alliance.\n\n\u201cThere is no excuse for the New York City marijuana arrests to continue at this level in 2017,\u201d Frederique continued. \u201cMayor de Blasio pledged to end biased policing practices\u2014if the end looks like more than 61,000 arrests on his watch and the same level of severe racial disparities, then the mayor has failed to carry out his campaign promises to black New Yorkers.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAustin Finan, de Blasio\u2019s first-deputy press secretary, told The Root that marijuana arrests have dropped 37 percent since the start of de Blasio\u2019s administration and that that should count for something.\n\n\u201cThis administration has led a dramatic shift away from unnecessary arrests for low-level marijuana offenses in favor of summonses,\u201d Finan said. \u201cThe NYPD responds to quality-of-life offenses where and when they are observed, many of which are reported by members of the public.\u201d\n\nInterestingly enough, the drop in marijuana arrests coincides with now-retired U.S. District Judge Shira A. Scheindlin\u2019s ruling in 2013 that the police practice of stop and frisk was unconstitutional. The drop in arrests can easily be interpreted as a by-product of the legal end of the racially discriminatory and violent policy\u2014even if the policy still holds true in practice\u2014rather than anything that de Blasio has done.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd even with marijuana-arrest rates down, the racial discrimination in those rates persists, as the Drug Policy Alliance\u2019s Frederique notes. Overwhelmingly, black and Latino residents are still being arrested at much higher rates than their white counterparts.\n\nAccording to Peter Donald, the NYPD\u2019s assistant commissioner for communication and public information, however, it isn\u2019t that the NYPD is racist; it\u2019s that black and brown people commit more crimes and are more likely to call the police. The NYPD, God bless \u2019em, is just doing its job.\n\n\u201cWhere the department makes arrests for drug activity is nearly identical to where we receive drug complaints,\u201d Donald told The Root. \u201cThat is to say [that] those who call 911 or 311 and ask for a police response, get a police response. We respond to calls for service and help the community where they are demanding it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve included two heat maps below, one [on the right] which shows where the complaints are coming from,\u201d Donald continued, \u201cand the second [on the left], that shows where we make arrests [from 2014]. As you can see, they are nearly identical.\u201d\n\nNo, in fact, they aren\u2019t identical at all\u2014but they are extraordinarily revealing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe \u201cheat\u201d is hottest in predominantly black and Latino poor and working-class areas of the city, such as Harlem and the Bronx. It appears that for almost every complaint in those areas that Donald said the maps represent, an arrest was made.\n\nIt gets really interesting in Brooklyn, one of the most gentrified areas of the United States. Where neighborhoods where black and brown people are known to reside\u2014Bedford-Stuyvesant, Flatbush, East New York, Canarsie, et al.\u2014arrest rates are high and seem to correspond with the alleged calls made by neighborhood residents. In neighborhoods where white people are known to reside\u2014Bensonhurst, Bay Ridge, Fort Hamilton, Bath Beach, et al.\u2014where calls also have allegedly been made by neighborhood residents, arrests did not follow.\n\nIt bears repeating that black and brown poor and working-class neighborhoods are becoming heavily gentrified; so it is questionable, at best, that it is black and brown people who are calling the police because people are outside smoking marijuana. More than likely, the increase in police calls is the result of gentrifiers doing the calling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdditionally, look at Staten Island (represented by the land mass in the top left of the maps): There are almost no low-level marijuana arrests in Staten Island, according to the above \u201cheat\u201d maps; the whiteness of it is glaring.\n\nDonald also made the argument that police \u201cproactively\u201d make arrests in neighborhoods where low-level crimes take place, but he didn\u2019t say why those neighborhoods were being hyperpoliced in the first place.\n\nWe know why, though. We\u2019ve always known.\n\n\u201cThe report says the \u2018Jim Crow era policies\u2019 and \u2018discriminatory marijuana arrests,\u2019\u201d Donald told The Root. \u201cThe Drug Policy Alliance report goes on to say \u2018strongly criticized the NYPD\u2019s racist marijuana possession arrests.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWith what proof?\u201d Donald continued. \u201cHow do these statements stand up to your scrutiny?\u201d\n\nVery well, in fact. I\u2019m not sure what Donald hoped to accomplish by sharing these \u201cidentical\u201d maps, but he failed miserably.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich leads us to conviction rates. As Politico reports:\n\n\n\nIn New York City in 2016, 15.8 percent of marijuana possession cases involving white people ended in conviction and sentencing, while 32.3 percent of the cases involving black people and and 30 percent of the cases involving Hispanic people ended in conviction. Over that time, 67.4 percent of cases involving white people resulted in ACD [adjournment in contemplation of dismissal], while 56.7 percent of cases involving black people and 59.2 percent of cases involving Hispanic people ended in ACD.\n\nThe discrimination evident in arrest and conviction rates persists despite marijuana use among black and white people being roughly equal. While de Blasio\u2019s office touted the \u201cdramatic shift\u201d to ACD to The Root, there was no acknowledgment of the racial disparities therein.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cUnjust and Unconditional\u201d further exposes why it is so critical that we discuss white power structures and not simply white privilege; that we expose discrimination and not simply point to disparities. This is an intentional occupation of black and brown communities; a continual profiteering from generational poverty inflicted by a white supremacist capitalist society.\n\n\n\nThis report is more evidence, as if any were needed, that slavery and, by extension, Jim Crow never ended\u2014it was simply redesigned by shape-shifters to avoid detection.\n\nSo-called liberal white men like de Blasio can be dangerous because they appear likable and nice, with warm smiles on their faces and the expectation of gratitude in their voices. Too many people falsely believe that that niceness and politeness is substantive and progressive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt isn\u2019t.\n\nAs \u201cUnjust and Unconditional\u201d\u2014and the flimsy defense and denial offered by de Blasio\u2019s office and the NYPD\u2014illuminates, numbers may not always tell the full story, but they don\u2019t lie.\n\nClick here to read \u201cUnjust and Unconstitutional: 60,000 Jim Crow Marijuana Arrests in Mayor de Blasio\u2019s New York.\u201d\n\n", "keywords": ["york", "whites", "targeted", "jim", "white", "finds", "report", "higher", "marijuana", "arrests", "possession", "rates", "blacks", "black", "blasio", "residents", "nyc", "laws", "crow", "arrested"], "polarity": 0.03103192536429531, "subjectivity": 0.42639133698671255},

We have a crumbling infrastructure, a president who wants to take us to war with Canada (Canada!) and a Justice Department that clearly changed its slogan to \u201cJust-Us.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, if that\u2019s not enough on your plate, there are other places\u2014worldly, important places\u2014that also have political situations that matter to America and, yes, even to African Americans.\n\nThis weekend, on May 7, the French people will decide who the next president of France will be. The choice is between Marine Le Pen\u2014Nazi sympathizer, Donald Trump lover and Holocaust denier\u2014and Emmanuel Macron, who started his own political party last year, has little or no political experience, and married his high school drama teacher. Just imagine the 2020 presidential election if it were Mark Cuban vs. Trump.\n\nWhy does that matter to black people in America? First, France is the No. 1 tourist destination in the world and the top European destination for African Americans. There are James Baldwin and Josephine Baker tours throughout Paris, not to mention the amount of international commerce that French companies have in the United States\u2014thousands of jobs at Renault, Cablevision, L\u2019Oreal retailers and the like.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFurther, the more allies Trump has across the globe, especially in Europe, the more bold he\u2019ll become in his domestic policy here in America because there will be no one left to condemn him. To get an idea about what\u2019s at stake in the French election as well as the perspective of the Afro-French, The Root spoke with Rokhaya Diallo, who is a journalist, documentary filmmaker and television presenter on BET France (yes, there is a BET France!).\n\nThe Root: What was the vote breakdown in [the first round of] the French election? Were black French people galvanized by any of the candidates?\n\nRokhaya Diallo: We don\u2019t have such data; it\u2019s not allowed to count people based on their race. We don\u2019t have the breakdown based on estimation. We can have an idea from Martinique (considered part of France). Maybe 4 million [black voters out of about 47 million registered voters] in France; it\u2019s very difficult to know that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrance, like Germany, has strict policies about keeping demographic data, which means data about race and religious makeup of the country is not obtained by the state. On the one hand, this is meant to prevent using that data to oppress and target; on the other hand, it allows racist anecdotes about crime and immigration to exist without being debunked.\n\nTR: Do the political parties in France, either Macron\u2019s En Marche! or even Le Pen\u2019s National Front, actually target black voters, even in messaging?\n\nRD: I have a feeling that people of color, especially Muslims, are usually used by the parties, are used to explain what they stand for. Le Pen, from FN, ran under the idea of rejection of Muslims. Nobody speaks to them, but everyone speaks about them. Socialist candidate Benoit Hamon has tackled discrimination (himself) - but his party has done nothing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf history has shown us anything, white nationalist governments love to swap recipes and secrets on how best to oppress the hell out of people of color. The South African apartheid regime studied Jim Crow practices in the American South to put their system together. The Nazi Party borrowed practices from oppressive racial regimes all over the world. White nationalists in America have formed strong ties with Russia\u2019s government under [President Vladimir] Putin.\n\nThe Trump administration seeks to create an American Brexit through implementing the same racist policies pushed through by the British National Party. If France falls, Trump will have an ideological ally in Europe, with the German elections just around the corner.\n\nTR: How are current race relations in France?\n\nRD: We\u2019re [France] in a state of emergency since 2015. They can search homes, search your computer, and most of those people were of color, and nobody seems to care. It\u2019s not something that was tackled during the campaign; it\u2019s something that has become normal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe results of this sort of national \u201cstop and frisk\u201d in France has been severe and brutal. Several black French men have been killed in recent years during routine \u201cidentity checks.\u201d Including the recent case of 22-year-old Theo Luhaka this past February. Theo attempted to protect a friend from a brutal identity check by police and he was beaten and sodomized with a police baton. He woke up in the hospital with a 10-centimeter-long wound in his rectum. His justice? Sixty days off work and the cops walked free.\n\nTR: Is Macron really that better for race relations in France than Le Pen? It seems like anything would be better than a white nationalist.\n\nRD: Macron, his program is too vague\u2014I have no idea. He didn\u2019t have any precise programs about police treatment; he was very pro law-and-order policing. With him, I don\u2019t know what to expect. It would depend on who is more influential to him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf Le Pen wins, my main concern is the state of emergency and police brutality. You have a candidate who supports police in whatever they do, even if they are raping or killing someone. I would be very careful going out.

But Trump has been gushing privately for weeks about using the death penalty in drug cases in which the user dies. Because Trump can\u2019t stop campaigning, he\u2019s even praised countries that execute drug lords, The Hill reports:\n\n\u201cIf you go to Singapore, I said, \u2018Mr. President, what happens with your drugs?\u2019 \u2018We don\u2019t have a problem.

It\u2019s a reality. I just recently started working back out again because stairs were looking like obstacles I could not surmount without sounding like Lord Vader when I was through.\n\nI can\u2019t run a marathon. I can\u2019t even run the block. And I definitely wasn\u2019t prepared to run the race of the Tidal X Brooklyn benefit concert in the New York City borough Tuesday night.\n\nWelcome to Antisocial, the events-and-happenings blog for people who have social anxiety disorders. Or something like that. I basically just go to things and quietly weird out. It\u2019s fun. For someone. Not always me. But SOMEONE.\n\nFrom the response of the crowd, I could tell that Tidal X was also fun, but it was also exhausting because it kept Brooklyn\u2019s Barclays Center rocking well past midnight.\n\nLike, until 2 a.m., to be exact.\n\nWith 100 percent of the proceeds going to victims of recent natural disasters in Houston, Florida, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico and Mexico, Tidal X boasted a lineup that could make your head spin\u2014both from amazement and bewilderment\u2014as everyone featuring everyone was on that night, from the beloved and highly favored (headliners Jay-Z and Stevie Wonder), to those you politely tolerated while everyone else went nuts (Chris Brown), to \u201cShe\u2019s still working?\u201d (Iggy Azalea), to the Bronx, N.Y.\u2019s finest (Cardi B and Jennifer Lopez, whom I now very badly want to perform together after typing this), to get-\u2019em-hype DJs (DJ Khaled and Kaskade), to a lot of, for me at least, \u201cWho?\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere was both good \u201cWho?\u201d (Jessie Reyez, whose EP I immediately downloaded as soon as I got home, just off the strength of her performance of the very timely \u201cGatekeepers\u201d) and literally \u201cI had no clue they existed until Tuesday night,\u201d like Tee Grizzley, whom the crowd was definitely into even though I was lost in my own thoughts, which included \u201cI am old\u201d and \u201cWhen will someone sing or rap a song I recognize?\u201d\n\nThank goodness for DJ Khaled and his merry band of special guests, which included Busta Rhymes, Swizz Beatz and T.I. Otherwise, I might not ever have got hype.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile most focused on the night\u2019s overall theme of positivity and unity, with lots of shoutouts to Puerto Rico and its plight, not everyone stayed away from the political. Stevie Wonder, who closed the show (at 1:30 in the morning!!!), brought up how he recently took two knees for the nation in solidarity with the NFL protesters, and Pastor Donnie McClurkin called out for God to help in the White House.\n\n\n\nNo one said the president\u2019s name, per se, but it was heavily implied that something had gone terribly wrong in our nation\u2019s disaster relief efforts\u2014particularly in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, where many are still without power and water\u2014and now it was up to the people, and the celebrities at Tidal X, to band together to get the job done.\n\n\u201cAs people with influence and the power to inspire and galvanize people, there comes a responsibility to use that platform for something substantial when given the opportunity,\u201d Chicago-based hip-hop artist Vic Mensa told The Root while walking the red carpet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI briefly chatted with Mensa about President Donald Trump and his tendency to bring up violence in Chicago as a counterpoint whenever others in the news try to focus the conversation on policing, police brutality, gun violence and mass incarceration. Mensa\u2019s response could easily have been applied to the situation in Puerto Rico.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not coincidental,\u201d Mensa says. \u201cThis is a tactic, a technique, if you will, of white supremacy. You create a chaotic, self-destructive situation for your capitalist constituents, then you let it tear itself apart, then you point to it as the reason to why these people can\u2019t be left alone to their own devices. You know, so, I just recognize it for what it is in its historical framework. It\u2019s not new. This is what white supremacy does. It\u2019s a mind game. And so Chicago is just [a] pawn in Trump\u2019s mass manipulative mind game.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though the concert didn\u2019t start until 8, I was there at 5:30 p.m. to work my first-ever red carpet, making this actually an eight-and-a-half-hour excursion. Somehow, in all my years of journalism, including entertainment reporting in ol\u2019 Bakersfield, Calif., I\u2019d never managed to work a red carpet where celebrities and wannabe celebs alike chatted it up with TV crews and bloggers. Let\u2019s just say it was an experience, and I\u2019m glad I was wearing tennis shoes.\n\n\n\nThankfully, I was sandwiched between red-carpet newbie, and digital editor at Fuse, Bianca Gracie and red-carpet veteran, and news and entertainment reporter for Hollywood Life, Jenna Lemoncelli. They both gave me tips: Be aggressive; keep questions light and short if the red carpet is crazy, since most folks won\u2019t have a lot of time to chat; and be aware that most of them are plugging a product\u2014like rapper Yo Gotti, who was wearing a silver jacket with black lettering detailing when his newest album will drop (Oct. 27).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe person who was easiest to talk to was WBNA player, Roc Nation Sports member and recently wed Skylar Diggins-Smith of the Dallas Wings.\n\nI asked her if she had any advice for us out there looking for the kind of love she has with Daniel Smith.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI married my best friend. We grew up together. We went to middle school together,\u201d Diggins-Smith said. \u201cFind somebody that loves you, cares about you, that you can be honest with, that you can be yourself with, and go there. Do it!\u201d\n\nOh, those honeymooners! They make it sound so easy! Lemme just go fire up Tinder right now and find that guy.\n\nWait.\n\nNever mind.\n\nThe concert\u2014one part music fest, one part endurance test\u2014tested both my ability to have a good time despite crippling anxiety from being in a large space with thousands of people and my ability to stay awake. It wasn\u2019t that the acts weren\u2019t good; it was more that I was already tired before I got there, willing myself to go on to get to Jay-Z\u2019s and Stevie Wonder\u2019s performances later in the show.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor most acts, the performances were short.\n\nThis was good in the case of some, like Iggy Azalea, who kind of rap-squatted her way through her song \u201cWork\u201d and then did nothing else, while a troupe of black women did the most, gesticulating wildly in support of this nonfactor of a song.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWork,\u201d a song I kind of actually sort of liked when it first came out but had since forgotten about, was an interesting choice, considering that her biggest hit is \u201cFancy,\u201d a far superior bop, steadied by the poppy vibes of Charli XCX. But \u201cWork\u201d it was!\n\nPerhaps it was more a conscious choice to re-educate people about her background (the song features the lyric \u201cNo money, no family, 16 in the middle of Miami\u201d). Regardless, everyone just sort of politely sat through it and clapped (it was for charity, yo), instead of being dicks about her existence within the poppier end of hip-hop.\n\n\n\nSpeaking of only performing one hit, dropping a rap squat and sauntering off\u2014Cardi B performed her banger \u201cBodak Yellow,\u201d and the New York City crowd collectively lost their shit. The regular-schmegular-degular girl from the Bronx went even further than \u201cbloody shoes\u201d and had a whole blood-red, skintight bodysuit on, complete with revealing cutouts and a lot of boob action.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter Cardi finished her hard rock performance, she dropped the patina of toughness and melted into all smiles, thrilled to be a part of the concert, sauntering off the stage while commenting on how \u201cfat\u201d her ass looked.\n\nOther notable moments:\n\nJay-Z\n\nObviously, this was the main draw here.\n\nJay came out and performed songs old and new, from opening with \u201cEmpire State of Mind\u201d to covering songs from 4:44, including \u201cFamily Feud\u201d and \u201cThe Story of O.J.\u201d He also did his half of \u201cNiggas in Paris,\u201d which mildly annoyed me because all I could think was, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be nice if Jay and Kanye had secretly made up already and Kanye was here, and then Kanye could come out and do his verse!?\u201d But that did not happen because, as far as I know, that has not happened. There were no big surprises like that during the night, unless you counted all of DJ Khaled\u2019s special guests\u2014which I do not\u2014because they totally did \u201cRuff Ryders\u2019 Anthem\u201d without DMX.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn their defense, though, DMX was probably busy with jail or something.\n\nJennifer Lopez\n\nI was surprised at how excited I was to see J.Lo. Maybe it was enduring all of the earlier, lesser-known acts whose songs I didn\u2019t know that made me all the more grateful that she came out to \u201cI\u2019m Real\u201d in a red, deconstructed hoodie-type onesie with thigh-high, sparkly red boots on and mermaid-long blond hair. I was happy to see her! She was like an old friend, happily still willing to go through elaborate dance routines for you, one more \u2019gain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was also disturbed to find that not only did I remember quite a few of the words from \u201cJenny From the Block,\u201d but I also remembered some of the words to \u201cOn the Floor,\u201d her last big hit. (Well, actually, I remember the words to this parody by the Key of Awesome better, to the point where I prefer the parody to the original, but that\u2019s beside the point.)\n\nFifth Harmony\n\nThe only songs by them I know are \u201cWork From Home\u201d (a song I like) and that nightmare song where they name-drop Michelle Obama. They did not sing the Michelle Obama song, thankfully. Watching them also made me realize that unlike with Destiny\u2019s Child, TLC, En Vogue or any other girl group of my youth, I could not pick any member of Fifth Harmony out of a lineup.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(This isn\u2019t so much a slam on them as a slam on me for clearly being old.)\n\nI also hated their outfits (it\u2019s really hard to pull off pink latex).\n\n\n\nWillow Smith\n\nSmith did an acoustic set that the people behind me talked throughout, joking that she looked like her brother Jaden. They also seemed annoyingly unaware that she\u2019d done any music since \u201cWhip My Hair,\u201d which is just ... I mean, c\u2019mon. I\u2019m old, and even I knew that Willow Smith has branched out since her initial stab at being a child pop star.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t just during Willow. These annoying people were annoying the whole night with their \u201cjokes,\u201d constant bumping into my hair, running commentary and shouting \u201cWhere\u2019s Beyonc\u00e9?\u201d when Jay-Z was performing.\n\nDonnie McClurkin\n\nIn a show where Jessie Reyez, quite passionately and explicitly, sang about sexual harassment in the entertainment industry on her track \u201cGatekeepers\u201d ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhere Yo Gotti talked about it \u201cgoing down in the DMs\u201d ...\n\nWhere almost every woman performing did it sans pants (with some notable exceptions, including Princess Nokia\u2014thrower of soups, first of her name\u2014and Reyez, who both rocked denim) ...\n\nAnd where Chris Brown\u2014CHRIS BROWN\u2014sang an entire song about the lack of loyalty among \u201chos,\u201d Pastor McClurkin was there to remind you about Jesus.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI actually respect McClurkin for this. If you\u2019re looking to convert sinners, what better place than a Tidal X concert where Chris Brown is performing?\n\nI\u2019m not much of a follower of any religion, but McClurkin and his large backing choir were memorable and good. Also, McClurkin was there to remind everyone that this was a party with a very distinct purpose\u2014helping those in need\u2014which was nice.\n\nChris Brown\n\nAs if sensing me glaring at him from section 24, row 18, Chris Brown came out talking about how this night was about positivity. No negative vibes. Yada yada. My glaring, of course, meant nothing. Brown has a huge fan base, and they were very hyped for his marginal singing, schmedium bangers and admittedly fantastic dancing. Even I, a proud hater, can admit that the jerk can put on a show. Hence why it\u2019s so disappointing that his personality is so explicitly trash.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut again, the show was for charity, so I sat there and watched, politely saying nothing. I wasn\u2019t the only one sitting down. But I was the only one sitting down not singing along the words to \u201cLoyal.\u201d\n\nYou let me down, guy also sitting, two rows in front of me!\n\nStevie Wonder\n\nThe magic of Stevie Wonder is that in concert, live, he still sounds the same as he did years ago when he first recorded many of his hits. Unfortunately, this magic was still not good enough to make me stay for all of Wonder\u2019s final set because my man the musical genius in all his old age did not take the stage until 1:30 a.m. I was bleary-eyed and starting to have a\u2014for real\u2014meltdown. I left just as he was going into \u201cSuperstition\u201d\u2014along with about half the audience, who were also pooped.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was so mentally exhausted and out of it, it took me a good 20 minutes to find a cab to take me home because I couldn\u2019t concentrate on the task at hand. My brain kept saying shit like, \u201cWe need to get home before we wander into traffic and get hit by a car,\u201d but my body was like, \u201cLet\u2019s stare at this streetlight for five minutes.\u201d\n\nNeedless to say, I did, eventually, make it home in one piece, but I doubt that I\u2019ll try another late-night, all-night music fest like Tidal X again. I loved the experience, but even Stevie Wonder couldn\u2019t keep my brain from fracturing into little pieces of woe from exhaustion.\n\nNo one can stop that. That\u2019s just who I am.\n\nChris Brown Stevie Wonder Remy Ma and Fat Joe Fifth Harmony Chris Brown DJ Khaled and T.I.

The law specifically said that \u201clegalization of illegal drugs is an unconscionable surrender in the war on drugs.\u201d When it was reauthorized in 1998, Congress stipulated that no federal funds be used to study the legalization of marijuana or other Schedule I drugs and that the office had to \u201coppose any attempt to legalize\u201d cannabis.\n\nUnder Obama, officials in the department seriously considered ending the federal prohibition on marijuana. While they didn\u2019t consider making it legal and easily available, former ONDCP Deputy Director Thomas McLellan said that the office was \u201cin favor of decriminalizing but not legalizing.\u201d\n\nThe administration\u2019s hands were ultimately tied by the laws that made the office possible. \u201cIt forced the office to take a policy position that it may or may not agree to,\u201d said Michael Botticelli, former director of the drug czar\u2019s office. Botticelli added that the legislation \u201chamstrings you into a policy position that might be the policy of the day but that might change.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause of the language that created their office, ONDCP officials couldn\u2019t even give their honest opinion about marijuana legislation, which made them look either ignorant of the overwhelming research or hypocritical in the eyes of scientists, criminal-reform advocates and marijuana activists. They were forced to publicly advocate against studying the issue or considering alternatives.\n\nObama\u2019s drug-czar office was also concerned that decriminalization would obstruct its efforts to solve the opioid epidemic that was creeping across the country. Constrained by the letter of the law, the administration took a more nuanced approach. The Justice Department instructed prosecutors to seek the minimum penalty for nonviolent drug offenses. They advocated against mandatory minimums. They increased funding for treatment and education.\n\nWashington, D.C., offered a rare glimpse into the administration\u2019s stance, however. The D.C. City Council\u2019s laws must be approved by Congress, so when District residents voted to legalize marijuana, Botticelli said, \u201cI might not agree about legalization, but I do agree with our own ability to spend our own money the way that we want to.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe legalization of marijuana is not simply a topic of public health debate; it is also a social justice and criminal-reform issue. While studies show that blacks and whites use pot at about the same rate, the American Civil Liberties Union says that African Americans are about four times more likely to be arrested for possession. A 2013 University of Michigan study showed that blacks are twice as likely as whites to be charged with a crime that carries a mandatory minimum sentence in similar circumstances. The Sarasota Herald Tribune studied unequal sentencing in Florida and found:\n\nIn Manatee County, judges sentence whites convicted of felony drug possession to an average of five months behind bars. They give blacks with identical charges and records more than a year.\n\nThere is someone who could fix this. On May 15, Congress sent a bill to committee to reauthorize the ONDCP. Maybe the one person who could fix this will step in and pressure his party to end the idiocy that is marijuana prohibition. Or maybe he\u2019s too busy staying up late, snorting the new designer drug smuggled in from Russia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI think it\u2019s called Covfefe.\n\nRead the HuffPost report here.", "keywords": ["decriminalize", "wanted", "whites", "office", "federal", "marijuana", "drug", "ondcp", "drugs", "administration", "legalization", "officials", "policy", "obama"], "polarity": 0.06971458773784356, "subjectivity": 0.44185039766435114},

Before the youngest spawns of Kris Jenner officially embraced the Kardashian way and jumped the \u201ccelebreality\u201d shark, they were like Thing 1 and Thing 2 to me, background players that were indiscernible from one another. Kris\u2019 obsession with starting all her client's, I mean, kid\u2019s names with the letter K didn\u2019t help matters much either. But I\u2019ve gotten much better.\n\nI know that Thing 1 aka Kylie is in a relationship with Chris Brown\u2019s stunt double who sometimes puts out music that people much younger than me might listen to while intoxicated. I think at some point in the past few years she had an allergic reaction to shellfish or something that caused her lips to swell up. That or she got a new face, but I think it was shellfish. It\u2019s always shellfish. Oh, and she has/had beef with a Blac Chinese woman. That\u2019s basically the full extent of my Cliff Notes on Thing 1 aka Kylie.\n\nNow Thing 2 aka Kendall is the one that models. From what I know it\u2019s like real modeling. You know, like pictures that were not taken on a mobile device and don\u2019t only get published on Instagram and websites that tend to embed said images. She might do that too, but Thing 2 aka Kendall actually hits runways and gets published in fashion magazines and stuff. They still make those, right?\n\nAnyway, I generally don\u2019t make a habit of keeping tabs on what Thing 1 or Thing 2 do or say, but that changed when I kept seeing Thing 2\u2019s name pop up in my newsfeed with headlines like \u201cKendall Jenner Says \u2018I\u2019m Cool With My Breasts\u2019 On Decision to Go Braless.\u201d That\u2019s when I said to myself, \u201cHey, Self, we\u2019re cool with breasts too, right? Yeah, I thought so. This sounds right up our alley so let\u2019s go ahead and read up about some cool breasts.\u201d\n\nLong story short, it turns out that Thing 2 wrote something called \u201cFree the Nipple!\u201d on her website/app. I don\u2019t know why she has a website/app but I guess it\u2019s a thing. Whatever the reason I still refuse to subscribe to the darn thing just so I can read what she wrote. Seven-day free trial be damned. But there\u2019s a way around her pesky pay wall called Google, and according to People, Thing 2 said:\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t see what the big deal is with going braless. I think it\u2019s cool and I really just don\u2019t care! It\u2019s sexy, it\u2019s comfortable and I\u2019m cool with my breasts. That\u2019s it! \u2026 It\u2019s also a fun way to show off my different nipple rings. [Jewelry designer] Jacquie Aiche made me a couple of pieces that are really sick, like a pair of angel wings.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAww, angel wings. That sounds precious, but I digress\u2026\n\nI don\u2019t see what the big deal is either. If Rick Ross can walk around braless; why can\u2019t Thing 2? I mean, it\u2019s only fair. If we all have to suffer through seeing PDAMB (public displays of awkward man boobs) the payoff should be the opportunity of seeing a better boob. If Kendall wants to be this generation\u2019s Ms. Jackson (because she\u2019s nasty), then who are we to stop her? If she\u2019s cool with her breasts, goddammit I\u2019m cool with them, too.\n\nWhen it comes to the whole idea about not wearing a bra in public, I really don\u2019t see what the big fuss is. As long as releasing the Kraken from the confines of your bra doesn\u2019t put any young children in harm\u2019s way when they swing low sweet chariot I say go for it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat is unless, of course, we\u2019re related. Then all bets are off.\n\nI\u2019d prefer that anyone I share a gene pool with or who married into my family not partake in Kendall\u2019s free nip movement. Yes, it\u2019s contradictory, but that\u2019s my prerogative. Word to Bobby Brown.

McInnes left Vice 10 years ago because ... well ... he was just too racist. Since then, McInnes has been known for inflammatory, racist remarks such as calling Asians \u201cslopes\u201d and \u201criceballs,\u201d referring to Muslims as \u201cstupid,\u201d inbred and violent, and defending the use of blackface and the n-word.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMcInnes\u2019 main contribution to society is the Proud Boys, a white-loving, \u201cpro-Western\u201d fraternal organization. The Proud Boys actually sponsored the Berkeley protest in hopes that it would turn into a melee. They dress like skinheads, love Trump, must get \u201cjumped\u201d into the organization and are required to fight anti-fascists at public rallies; membership also requires tattoos. If this sounds like a street gang, there is one other weird rule that Proud Boys must follow: No masturbation (which kinda explains the group\u2019s aggressive, chauvinistic attitudes).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut now McInnes has teamed up with the Based Stickman to form FOAK\u2014which will serve as the Proud Boys\u2019 military unit. \u201cOur emphasis will be on street activism, preparation, defense and confrontation,\u201d Based Stickman, aka Chapman, said. \u201cWe will protect and defend our right-wing brethren when the police and government fail to do so.\u201d\n\nThe group says it is \u201cseeking able bodies and strong-minded men who can keep a cool head under pressure, comfortable in fisticuffs\u201d and say that it will serve as \u201ca force to protect and serve when the police are told to stand down.\u201d\n\nAt least we know they won\u2019t be beating their mea .... never mind.", "keywords": ["meet", "proud", "chapman", "trump", "nationalism", "serve", "based", "white", "mcinnes", "military", "boys", "stickman", "street", "vice", "division"], "polarity": 0.11799397920087575, "subjectivity": 0.5669403393541323},

Is it the color of red blood spilling onto concrete? Is it green like the dirty money folded into the back pockets of politicians who would rather incarcerate black youths than educate them?\n\n\n\nDuring The Root\u2019s Black History Month series on poverty and the drug war\u2014in partnership with the Drug Policy Alliance\u2014we continued to excavate the truth from the ruins of targeted and occupied communities that have been ravaged by the so-called war on drugs. We delved into the numbers and reiterated that poverty, police and prisons are forms of structural violence that have been thrust upon black, brown and indigenous communities in the service of white supremacist patriarchal capitalism\u2014that the shame is not ours.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is no conspiracy that this nation, which holds itself in such high esteem, despite being the prison warden of the world, has conspired against the very communities that were forced to build it on their backs.\n\nThe Drug Policy Alliance reports:\n\nPeople of color experience discrimination at every stage of the criminal-justice system and are more likely to be stopped, searched, arrested, convicted, harshly sentenced and saddled with a lifelong criminal record. This is particularly the case for drug-law violations.\n\nNearly 80 percent of people in federal prison and almost 60 percent of people in state prison for drug offenses are black or Latino.\n\nResearch shows that prosecutors are twice as likely to pursue a mandatory-minimum sentence for black people than for white people charged with the same offense. Among people who received a mandatory-minimum sentence in 2011, 38 percent were Latino and 31 percent were black.\n\nBlack people and Native Americans are more likely to be killed by law enforcement than other racial or ethnic groups. They are often stereotyped as being violent or addicted to alcohol and other drugs. Experts believe that stigma and racism may play a major role in police-community interactions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is no secret that the color of pain is black, and it is neither fatalistic nor nihilistic to come to that conclusion. It is neither a diminishing nor rejection of black joy, black resilience or black futures to make that plain. From draconian drug policies to disenfranchisement, money-bail bond systems to civil-asset forfeiture, food and housing instability to police officers killing black people with impunity\u2014and preying on vulnerable black women simply because they can\u2014this system was designed to enslave black people and ration out freedom.\n\n\n\nSo, what does justice look like within a white supremacist police state that lies to itself about the depth of its own character? What freedom dreams can we conjure within a system created to criminalize, dehumanize and destroy us?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKassandra Frederique, New York state director at the Drug Policy Alliance, the visionary behind DPA\u2019s Black History Month series, and 2016 The Root 100 honoree, has consistently and unapologetically maintained that the history of the drug war in this country is inextricably linked to black history. She\u2019s not wrong.\n\nWe can\u2019t discuss the history of black America without acknowledging that the Nixon administration camouflaged its war on black people by causing hysteria around drugs, nor without acknowledging the Jim Crow-era drug policies that continue to define Bill de Blasio\u2019s New York City.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe can\u2019t discuss the history of black America without discussing mass incarceration, the disappearing of black men into the jaws of the criminal-(in)justice system, the vilification of black mothers suffering through addiction and the state-sponsored police slaying of black children.\n\nWe can\u2019t ignore that the drug war has influenced everything from inhumane immigration policies to racist housing policies. We can\u2019t ignore that generational poverty has been equated to moral bankruptcy in this country; nor can we ignore that harm reduction for some working-class or poor black people is less about battling addiction and more about navigating institutionalized, systemic anti-blackness. Grief, trauma, addiction, stigma, punishment: This is the cycle that must be broken.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor some black people, it is an act of self-perseverance to point to black people doing well by most metrics and say, \u201cLook, all of us aren\u2019t selling weed or living in the hood or in jail.\u201d And it is this line of classist, condescending thinking that led many black people to support tough-on-crime/tough-on-drugs legislation under both President Ronald Reagan and President Bill Clinton without looking at the oppressive conditions that often lead to both. In this country, more than any other, violent drug policy has been carved out of black flesh.\n\nThe color of pain is black, but so is the color of freedom.\n\n\u201cBlack people have been the most severely impacted by the war on drugs,\u201d Frederique said. \u201cAnd in this moment when white faces have caused the nation to have a critical interrogation about what to do about drugs, black people need the whole story so, in the moment, that we can demand the necessary acknowledgment, atonement and action to build our communities.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAcknowledge.\n\nAtone.\n\nAct.\n\nThat is what Color of Pain\u2014a Drug Policy Alliance initiative spearheaded by Frederique and Dionna King, policy manager at the New York office of the Drug Policy Alliance\u2014is demanding: reparations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Color of Pain website is an invaluable resource for us all. The necessity of Racial and Ethnic Impact Statements, which \u201c[require] policymakers proposing new legislation or changes to existing legislation to assess the potential impact on racial disparities,\u201d is outlined. The drug war\u2019s destructive path is mapped through all the systems that black people are forced to navigate without the recognition of their humanity: education, social services, mental health, the criminal-justice system and the child-welfare system.\n\n\n\nAs Black History Month comes to a close, let us remember that black dignity is important year-round; black health is important year-round; black joy is important year-round; black lives matter year-round. And we do that by releasing ourselves from the pathology that this nation has intentionally crafted to make us feel small, less than, unworthy, criminal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe must not be complicit in perpetuating dangerous, dishonest, violent narratives about the people we love, the people who look like us, the people whom this war on drugs has harmed the most.\n\nIt cannot be said enough that this system is not broken. It is working exactly as it was intended to work; oppressing exactly whom it was designed to oppress; profiting exactly from the bodies it was designed to profit from; and destroying exactly whom it was designed to destroy.\n\nStill, the color of freedom is black\u2014and, together, we will win.\n\nVisit Color of Pain website to learn more about reparative justice, the calamitous effects of the drug war in black and Latinx communities, and policy solutions that will move us forward.", "keywords": ["color", "history", "justice", "pain", "war", "reparative", "drug", "drugs", "black", "system", "yearround", "end", "needed", "policy"], "polarity": -0.04665102475649354, "subjectivity": 0.4499151109307356},

There were some photos (video) of desiccated bodies rotting in the sun, and others of reed-thin waifs, their empty bellies bloated, being held to the last by emaciated mothers with no milk to give.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe incoming president, during the course of his world briefs, would have had these photos if he cared to look at them and thick dossiers if he cared to read them. But then, a bunch of black women and children dying in the African sun was hardly worth a white man\u2019s tweet. . . .\u201d\n\nJournal-isms asked Witherspoon whether there was anything to be said about the role of the news media.\n\n\u201cThe white oriented news media avoids race,\u201d Witherspoon replied by email. \u201cThere was a lot of talk about how the videos affected Trump and apparently made him do a 180 in foreign policy over the span of 2 days. But none of the media I saw \u2014 from Rachel to Fox \u2014 asked what made this set of videos and this gas attack so different from the other 160 documented gas attacks?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was JUST 4 years ago that he said the chemical attack murder of 1,400 was none of our business. But at that time, as you know, American newspapers did not show dead bodies. This time, however, he saw a video of people dying.\n\n\u201cis that all it took? maybe. but considering his callousness to dead children everywhere, it seemed to me the difference this time was that the kids appear white and he identified with them as children, not as niggers and slopes,\u201d a derogatory term for a \u201cVietnamese/Asian person,\u201d according to the Urban Dictionary. \u201cthe more I watched last night the angrier I got.\u201d\n\nIf a sermon Saturday night at the 7,000-member, historically black Alfred Street Baptist Church in Alexandria, Va., is any indication, Witherspoon is not alone in his observation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a passage denouncing capital punishment, the Rev.

At the International Journalism Festival in Perugia, Italy, the Dart Center for Journalism & Trauma at Columbia University was planning a panel for Saturday on \u201cTrolls in the Newsroom.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOnline interaction holds out the promise of thought-provoking discussion and more engaged audiences, but journalists increasingly face the kind of abuse and harassment that poisons genuine debate and in some cases can lead to real psychological harm,\u201d a description read.\n\n\u201cThis panel will offer a guide to trolls, their tactics, habitats and various subspecies, ones which range from those who are mostly thoughtless and inconsiderate to those who are systematically organised and more genuinely dangerous. Panelists will share experience, offer their personal strategies for pushing back against the toxic tide and discuss what it may take to create a free and civil online space for both journalists and their audiences.\u201d\n\nFor the journalists assembled by Unity in Washington, the discussion quickly turned to sharing strategies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNicki Mayo, a multimedia journalist who is president of the Baltimore Association of Black Journalists, said black journalists had been asked to accompany white reporters who ventured into black communities, but she was not so protected when she worked in Appalachia and assigned to cover NASCAR events at the Bristol Motor Speedway in Bristol, Tenn.\n\nMayo said she had to set boundaries, such as \u201cwho\u2019s allowed to touch you,\u201d and to decide \u201cwhen to call the station and say, \u2018I can\u2019t do that\u2019 \u201c assignment.\n\nDoris Truong, a homepage editor at the Washington Post, went public with her experience in January.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAngry tweets and retweets claim the home page editor of the Washington Post was caught sneaking pictures of Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson\u2019s notes during his confirmation hearing,\u201d Jill Geisler wrote at the time for the Center for Digital Ethics & Policy. \u201cThere\u2019s video.

Sharif Durhams, a fellow Post homepage editor, agreed with going public in such situations. \u201cWe need to be more transparent in what we do.\u201d\n\nSuch incidents place more of a burden on supervisors, according to Carrie Budoff Brown, editor of Politico.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn February, right-wing media falsely reported that Politico\u2019s Alex Isenstadt laughed when White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer told him that a young White House aide became emotional in reporting the death of Chief Ryan Owens, the Navy SEAL killed in action in Yemen.\n\n\u201cHe was not laughing,\u201d Brown said. \u201cHe felt damaged by that. He said, \u2018My friends from high school are calling me.\u2019 . . . I have to think about how I\u2019m supporting him in a public sense and in a private sense. . . .\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a personal dimension and a stinging dimension\u201d to these new attacks, which differ in \u201cvolume, coordination and relentlessness,\u201d Brown told the Unity group.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome journalists said they had been told to \u201csuck it up,\u201d or, as Native American journalist Rhonda LeValdo said, to \u201cjust let it go.\u201d After all, said Mizell Stewart, a USA Today Network executive and president of the American Society of News Editors, \u201cIf you want to be loved, don\u2019t become a journalist.\u201d\n\nJuliet Beverly, who has been an officer of the Washington Association of Black Journalists, said journalists must remind themselves that historically, \u201cwe\u2019ve had to deal with tougher situations\u201d inside and outside the newsroom.\n\nIt is also true, said Karen Hansen, membership and programs manager of the Radio Television Digital News Association, that journalists \u201cdon\u2019t want to become part of the story.\u201d But, Hansen said, \u201cit\u2019s too late. Journalists have been made players.

Another participant urged reporters at White House briefings to re-ask questions of other reporters if they are not answered.\n\nThe subject of abuse became one for the caucus groups created to recommend solutions to issues raised during the day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome of their ideas: Send reporters out in teams; talk about mental health; share protective steps with freelancers as well as staffers; become more proactive with emailing; make protection a collective, not an individual, issue; identify others who have been victimized; conduct debriefings after such incidents.\n\nAnd take time for yourself, said Jesse J. Holland, who covers race relations for the Associated Press. \u201cIt can be emotionally draining,\u201d he said of his job. \u201cYou have to have something for yourself that gives me a reason to go back to work.\u201d For him, Holland said, that\u2019s family.\n\nJoe Grimm, a former Detroit Free Press recruiter who teaches diversity issues in his journalism classes at Michigan State University, indicated that the haters might not be winning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOn Election Night, somebody put hands on one of our students,\u201d Grimm said.

After all, politicians bring up the people in their lives who they saw needlessly suffer and die due to drugs for a specific purpose: to call for an approach to addiction focused on public health over criminal justice.\n\n\u201cBut in this way, these stories also expose the impact of another issue that may not seem related at first: race.\n\n\u201cEven after decades of progress on racial issues, America remains a very segregated country. On a day to day basis, most Americans closely interact only with people of the same race. And that impacts our policies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cConsider the opioid epidemic, which contributed to the record 52,000 drug overdose deaths reported in 2015. Because the crisis has disproportionately affected white Americans, white lawmakers \u2014 who make up a disproportionate amount of all levels of government \u2014 are more likely to come into contact with people afflicted by the opioid epidemic than, say, the disproportionately black drug users who suffered during the crack cocaine epidemic of the 1980s and \u201990s.\n\n\u201cAnd that means a lawmaker is perhaps more likely to have the kind of interaction that Christie, Trump, Bush, and Fiorina described \u2014 one that might lead them to support more compassionate drug policies \u2014 in the current crisis than the ones of old.\n\n\u201cIs it any wonder, then, that the crack epidemic led to a \u2018tough on crime\u2019 crackdown focused on harsher prison sentences and police tactics, while the current opioid crisis has led more to calls for legislation, including a measure Congress passed last year, that boosted spending on drug treatment to get people with substance use disorders help? . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHernandez D. Stroud, Time: Our Opioid Crisis Reveals Deep Racial Bias In Addiction Treatment\n\nHow a Series on Latinos Won the Top Pulitzer Prize\n\nAs the Pulitzer Prize administrators prepare to announce the 2017 awards on Monday, Frank O. Sotomayor, who worked for 35 years at the Los Angeles Times, has published a free online book, \u201cThe Pulitzer Long Shot: How Our 1983 Latino Stories for L.A. Times Won Journalism\u2019s Top Prize.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt begins, \u201cTwice we had been rebuffed. Twice, Los Angeles Times editor Bill Thomas had told us our 1983 series on Latinos was not worthy of a Pulitzer Prize nomination. Twice we had walked dejectedly out of his office in the publisher\u2019s suite. But would we \u2014 Frank del Olmo, George Ramos and I \u2014 accept no for the final answer? No way!\n\n\u201cWe were granted one more appointment with Thomas. On Friday, December 30, as 1983 was winding down, we walked purposefully into his office. Thomas sat at a large desk, his window-lined second-floor office just a block from L.A.\u2019s iconic City Hall and other government buildings.\n\n\u201cWe presented our case once again, this time with even more passion and determination than before. We wanted our series, which had won high praise from readers and earlier from Thomas, to be nominated as acknowledgment of our good work. Thomas repeated that the series, although a good product, was \u2018not the type that wins a Pulitzer.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe said Pulitzers typically were awarded for investigative series that produce change. Besides, he told us, staff members had already prepared 27 Pulitzer entries from the Times, and they were nearly ready to ship them to Columbia University for judging.\n\n\u201cTwice rebuffed, we were not about to accept anything but an affirmative response. We were there representing 14 other journalists, all Mexican Americans, who had initiated the project with a single goal \u2014 to inform and educate the public about Mexican Americans and other Latinos.\n\n\u201cWe had poured our hearts out while producing an exceptional 27-story series in one of the largest reporting projects in L.A. Times history. We had conducted more than 1,000 interviews to flesh out our portrait of the Latino community of Southern California.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cGoing far beyond often-stereotypical news coverage, we had examined and written about education, politics, the job market, culture, religion, immigration, the arts and much more, all with a human focus. . . .\u201d\n\nShort Takes\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA memorial service for Roger W.

Before the youngest spawns of Kris Jenner officially embraced the Kardashian way and jumped the \u201ccelebreality\u201d shark, they were like Thing 1 and Thing 2 to me, background players who were indiscernible from each other. Kris\u2019 obsession with starting all her clients\u2019\u2014I mean kids\u2019\u2014names with the letter K didn\u2019t help matters much, either. But I\u2019ve gotten much better.\n\nI know that Thing 1, aka Kylie, is in a relationship with Chris Brown\u2019s stunt double who sometimes puts out music that people much younger than me might listen to while intoxicated. I think at some point in the past few years, she had an allergic reaction to shellfish or something that caused her lips to swell up. That, or she got a new face, but I think it was shellfish. It\u2019s always shellfish. Oh, and she has/had beef with a Blac Chinese woman. That\u2019s basically the full extent of my CliffsNotes on Thing 1, aka Kylie.\n\nNow, Thing 2, aka Kendall, is the one who models. From what I know, it\u2019s like real modeling. You know, like pictures that were not taken on a mobile device and don\u2019t only get published on Instagram and websites that tend to embed said images. She might do that, too, but Thing 2, aka Kendall, actually hits runways and gets published in fashion magazines and stuff. They still make those, right?\n\nAnyway, I generally don\u2019t make a habit of keeping tabs on what Thing 1 or Thing 2 does or says, but that changed when I kept seeing Thing 2\u2019s name pop up in my newsfeed with headlines like, \u201cKendall Jenner Says \u2018I\u2019m Cool With My Breasts\u2019 on Decision to Go Braless.\u201d That\u2019s when I said to myself, \u201cHey, self, we\u2019re cool with breasts, too, right? Yeah, I thought so. This sounds right up our alley, so let\u2019s go ahead and read up about some cool breasts.\u201d\n\nLong story short, it turns out that Thing 2 wrote something called \u201cFree the Nipple!\u201d on her website/app. I don\u2019t know why she has a website/app, but I guess it\u2019s a thing. Whatever the reason, I still refuse to subscribe to the darn thing just so I can read what she wrote, seven-day free trial be damned. But there\u2019s a way around her pesky paywall called Google, and according to People, Thing 2 said:\n\n\n\nI really don\u2019t see what the big deal is with going braless. I think it\u2019s cool and I really just don\u2019t care! It\u2019s sexy, it\u2019s comfortable and I\u2019m cool with my breasts. That\u2019s it! \u2026 It\u2019s also a fun way to show off my different nipple rings. [Jewelry designer] Jacquie Aiche made me a couple of pieces that are really sick, like a pair of angel wings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAww, angel wings. That sounds precious, but I digress \u2026\n\nI don\u2019t see what the big deal is either. If Rick Ross can walk around braless, why can\u2019t Thing 2? I mean, it\u2019s only fair. If we all have to suffer through seeing PDAMB (public displays of awkward man boobs), the payoff should be the opportunity to see a better boob. If Kendall wants to be this generation\u2019s Ms. Jackson (because she\u2019s nasty), then who are we to stop her? If she\u2019s cool with her breasts, goddamnit, I\u2019m cool with them, too.\n\nWhen it comes to the whole idea about not wearing a bra in public, I really don\u2019t see what the big fuss is. As long as releasing the Kraken from the confines of your bra doesn\u2019t put any young children in harm\u2019s way when they swing low, sweet chariot, I say go for it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat is unless, of course, we\u2019re related. Then all bets are off.\n\nI\u2019d prefer that anyone I share a gene pool with or who married into my family not partake in Kendall\u2019s free-nip movement. Yes, it\u2019s contradictory, but that\u2019s my prerogative. Word to Bobby Brown. Pookie \u2019n\u2019 \u2019em might wanna see my 18th cousin on my great-uncle\u2019s stepdaughter\u2019s side free the nipple, but not me. That\u2019d just be awkward, like Woody Allen-marrying-Soon-Yi kinda awkward. That\u2019s why I\u2019m strictly down with OPB (other people\u2019s breasts).\n\nAs a happily married man, I\u2019ve committed myself to having direct contact with only one pair for the rest of my life, but that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t go window-shopping on occasion just to see what new models are on the market. With Kendall talking about angel wings and whatnot, it sounds like Victoria has been keeping some secrets I need to look into. That or I totally misinterpreted what Beyonc\u00e9 meant when she said, \u201cIf you liked it, then you should\u2019ve put a ring on it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEither way, a free nipple ain\u2019t never hurt nobody. If you like it, I love it.\n\nAnslem Samuel Rocque is a Brooklyn, N.Y.-based writer who previously ran the popular relationship site Naked With Socks On.

I started loving him shortly after he walked offstage after making his now-historic 2004 Democratic National Convention speech. During his time as president, not only was Obama an example of class and excellence in office, but for many black men, he was also a role model for how to move in a complicated minefield of white supremacy.\n\n\n\nBut my love for Obama didn\u2019t keep me from holding him accountable. He was the president, not my cousin. So when he was critical of black protesters, even dipping low to wade in the \u201cthug\u201d pond, I was critical of him. When he admitted to The Atlantic writer Ta-Nehisi Coates that African Americans were due reparations but there wasn\u2019t a practical way to administer and sustain political efforts for them to happen, I was disheartened. For years I agreed with some of the old guard who were leery of his voting record when he initially ran for office.\n\nNo matter my fondness for the first black president, he was my president, and when his moves weren\u2019t in alignment with my beliefs, or beliefs that I believed the office demanded, I had to call it what it was.\n\nIn President Donald Trump, white supremacists have not found a politician whom they hold accountable; they have an ally whom they protect and defend blindly as if he\u2019s their dad.\n\nI think that any right-minded person who is willing to look at this administration objectively would clearly describe this presidency, after less than two months in office, as \u201cthe Clampetts coming to Washington.\u201d In less than two months, Trump sent troops into Yemen for no reason and has offended several heads of foreign states who called to congratulate him. He\u2019s declared a full-on war against the press and has created one of the most divisive and combative administrations in recent history. He has given top appointments in his Cabinet to grossly unqualified friends. He\u2019s spent damn near half his term on vacation and won\u2019t even reveal his taxes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd to top if all off, he\u2019s an online bully who goads congressmen on Twitter. And all of this bizarro behavior by the commander in chief isn\u2019t being challenged by his staunchest supporters because they adore him and literally look up to him as a father.\n\nTrump can try all he wants to denounce the \u201calt-right,\u201d but at this point he\u2019s a Maury guest who just found out the woman he loves had a baby who isn\u2019t his. He\u2019s going to continue to raise the alt-right because they love him unconditionally.\n\n\u201cTrump is a white nationalist, so to speak; he is alt-right, whether he likes it or not,\u201d said alt-right leader and white nationalist Richard Spencer in a recent interview on The David Pakman Show.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough Trump may not have fathered the movement, they possess enough of his racist features and little hands, so no matter how many times he tries to distance himself from them, they are a part of him. He\u2019s even moved their uncle Steve Bannon into his Cabinet. He also speaks their language and promotes their propaganda as actual journalism, and continues to feed them conspiracy theories from the highest office in the land.\n\nEarlier this year I wrote a tongue-in-cheek piece about Super Bowl LI. The spine of the piece was that since Trump was outwardly rooting for the New England Patriots, the Atlanta Falcons had become black America\u2019s team by default. The piece also pointed out that Tom Brady\u2019s cozy relationship with Trump made Brady, by default, racist adjacent.\n\nTrump supporters came for me on Twitter like babies wanting to know why I was calling their papa racist. I figured that pointing them to the thoroughly researched and well-reported New York Times deep dive into the 45-year history of Trump\u2019s racist past would be enough to prove my point.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI won\u2019t bore you with all the tweets I received, but I think the one below pretty much sums up the response I got from the alt-right:\n\nThis photo, in the eyes of Trump supporters, proves that he can\u2019t be racist. See the kidlike logic here? A businessman wouldn\u2019t pose for a photo with Don King and Jesse Jackson if he were a racist. It was baffling to me that an adult would feel that this was enough to clear a man of a history of racism. Trump supporters\u2019 response to the Times article? You guessed it: \u201cfake news.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt his core, Trump has appealed to a common thread that dates all the way back to the beginning of American civilization: hate. As long as he continues to appeal to this underbelly of America, his supporters will continue to claim to hate even policies like Obamacare and public assistance that may be in their best interests because they, too, are fueled by hate. There are still large swaths of this country where black people don\u2019t live, travel or dare be caught after the sun goes down, and white American haters will go to great lengths to protect their white sovereignty.\n\nIn Trump they have found the anti-Obama, a man motivated by hate who taps into the core values of American hatred and is willing to protect the constitutional right to hate. In two months the president has made indefensible moves of hatred toward Mexico, Muslims and the media. He has been caught spouting ignorant and unsubstantiated falsehoods ad nauseam, and his supporters find all of this justifiable. They will continue to battle for his flawed policies and word buffet of foolishness because they don\u2019t want to admit that there dad is clearly overmatched and barely treading water in the deep end of health care that he even now admits is difficult to comprehend.\n\nBut at some point, when you Trump supporters grow up a bit, you\u2019ll have to admit that the man you\u2019ve loved and protected like a father is not who you\u2019ve believed him to be. The man you saw as a unifier is really a divider. The man you wanted to believe loved your mother was really out here saying, \u201cGrab \u2019em by the pussy.\u201d The man who told you he would be there to pick you up after practice is never coming.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt some point you have to see the man for who he is and admit that he is hurting all of us\u2014you included.", "keywords": ["trump", "comes", "supporters", "white", "man", "hes", "office", "supremacists", "hate", "black", "president", "racist", "father"], "polarity": 0.024392117046756225, "subjectivity": 0.4001264485800567},

But Trump has been gushing privately for weeks about using the death penalty in drug cases in which the user dies. Because Trump can\u2019t stop campaigning, he\u2019s even praised countries that execute drug lords, The Hill reports:\n\n\u201cIf you go to Singapore, I said, \u2018Mr. President, what happens with your drugs?\u2019 \u2018We don\u2019t have a problem.

This Black History Month, The Root, in partnership with Drug Policy Alliance, takes a deep look at why the war on drugs cannot be divorced from generational poverty, the carceral state and white supremacy.\n\nAs the cannabis industry continues to grow, so, too, does the realization that black and brown, poor and working-class communities most harmed by the so-called war on drugs do not have access to this new gold rush.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe profiteers of this war\u2014this storefront operation created for the sole purpose of laundering the institutional, systemic, coordinated assaults on black and brown communities\u2014are primarily white men with access to capital who navigate society unencumbered by the intentional violence of the carceral state. This, subsequently, gives them the freedom to be legal drug dealers, while jails across the nation continue to be filled with black and brown people incarcerated for low-level drug crimes\u2014if police officers don\u2019t get to them first.\n\nThat might be how this white supremacist capitalist system was intended to function, but the Hood Incubator has something else in mind.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFormed in 2017 in Oakland, Calif., the Hood Incubator, founded by Ebele Ifedigbo, 29, and Lanese Martin, 32, was created in response to the state\u2019s marijuana legalization in order to create pathways to ownership in the cannabis industry for black and brown people most harmed by the drug war.\n\nThe community-centered organization is committed to \u201cbuilding economic and political power for black and brown communities,\u201d and is well on the way to radically transforming an industry guarded by white gatekeepers.\n\n\u201cWhile marijuana use is roughly equal among black[s] and whites nationwide, black people are nearly four times as likely to be arrested for marijuana possession,\u201d the Hood Incubator states on its website. \u201cNow that cannabis is a thriving $8 billion legal industry [pdf], black people make up less than 5 percent [pdf] of founders and business owners.\n\nIn the interview that follows, Ifedigbo talks to the The Root about the difficulties they\u2019ve faced in shattering racialized stigmas attached to cannabis, breaking through institutionalized barriers, abolition, and why it\u2019s necessary for black and brown people to be at the forefront of the cannabis industry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Root: When I think of the word \u201cincubator,\u201d the concept of incubation in the context of the hood, I think of distilling, healing, growing, becoming, protecting. Explain to me why it is important to you that black people, who have been most severely harmed by the drug war, have access to the growing cannabis industry?\n\n\n\nEbele Ifedigbo: It\u2019s important that black people have access to the growing cannabis industry precisely because we have been the most harmed by cannabis prohibition. There\u2019s the adage of \u201cmore risk, more reward\u201d when it comes to economics and investments. That same principle should hold true when it comes to the marijuana industry: Black communities have objectively taken on the vast majority of the risk and negative consequences associated with marijuana being illegal. We are four times more likely to be arrested for weed-related offenses than white people, despite the fact that marijuana use is equal across races.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe have taken on those consequences and it has had heartbreaking systematic outcomes for our families and communities. So, now, as the industry is legalizing and growing like wildfire, projected to be $20 billion by 2020, black communities should be at the forefront of accessing the rewards and resources that come along with that legalization and growth.\n\nTR: In a nation that renders economically exploited black and brown people disposable, what are some of the institutional barriers you\u2019ve faced in trying to arm our communities with the knowledge and licensure it requires to sell cannabis legally?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEI: In the process of developing the model for the Hood Incubator, we did extensive research and perspective gathering to make sure our work effectively addresses the barriers that our people are truly facing. Between Lanese using her background in community organizing and political organizing to do on-the-ground community organizing\u2014hosting early member meetings, attending council meetings with impacted residents, connecting people in different parts of the informal industry\u2014and my census and economic-data-based research, we were able to really hone in on the institutional barriers our folks are up against.\n\nWe found that, almost across the board, black and brown communities face barriers in accessing the 1) networks, 2) technical support and assistance, and 3) financial capital it takes to thrive in the legal industry.\n\nThe legal marijuana space is still very new, so \u201cwho you know\u201d is still a primary success factor. Are you connected to lawmakers? Are you connected to influential investors? Are you backed by community members? It is very difficult to thrive and compete in the marketplace if you are operating in isolation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGiven the state of the market, it is imperative that business owners surround themselves with a community of advisers, subject-matter experts and supporters who can help the business successfully navigate and make decisions in a rapidly growing and fast-paced, but also highly regulated, volatile and risky industry.\n\nOftentimes, black and brown people are cut off from these networks and knowledge bases, or it takes us longer to build the relationships, and that dampens our [collective] ability to keep up in the marijuana industry.\n\nAt the same time, the networks and knowledge bases that we have been able to resiliently amass over time in the informal marijuana industry are often judged negatively when assessed within the traditional frameworks of \u201centrepreneurial success,\u201d and that is used to justify our exclusion from industry opportunities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccess to financial capital is key, too. The marijuana business is capital intensive. The fact that the industry still operates in a gray area only adds to the cost of doing business and makes it more difficult to attract investment across the board. Entrepreneurs need financial capital to endure the ups and downs of the market and grow their businesses over time. But nationwide, less than 1 percent of venture capital funding goes to black founders. From our experiences, black founders in the marijuana industry are facing similar financial barriers.\n\n\n\nThat said, right now we have a wide-open opportunity to address these institutional barriers and shift the narrative. The key question is: How do we create a marijuana industry that fundamentally centers the interests of communities that have taken on the risks that have allowed for the legal industry to even exist in the first place? That is the work that the Hood Incubator takes on. We are working to make that vision real by centering black and brown communities in all the work we do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: One of the things that I\u2019ve witnessed is a kind of internalized hatred and fear and stigma that attaches cannabis to poverty and black criminality. There are some in our communities who believe \u201cjust saying no\u201d is what \u201crespectable\u201d black folks do. Have you witnessed this in your work\u2014and, if so, how have you worked to dismantle those perceptions?\n\n\n\nEI: Yes, we have come across these perspectives in our work. We welcome people with all different perspectives because we recognize that everyone is coming to this marijuana conversation with different experiences and assessments of what marijuana represents and what the promise of the industry is (or is not).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe know that, at the end of the day, if you are black, you have experienced negative impacts from the drug war, either directly or indirectly. And that gives your voice, your questions and your concerns an inherent weight and legitimacy that cannot be denied.\n\nWe create a culture at the Hood Incubator where any of our community members can come to learn and discuss the plant and the industry amongst peers. As a community, when we share our stories and perspectives amongst ourselves, we are all able to both teach and learn in equal measure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen engaging folks who are wary of cannabis and what it represents, we center the core promise of the industry. For the Hood Incubator, the marijuana industry represents an opportunity for our communities to build tangible economic and political power, especially given the fact that we have paid and continue to pay the costs that it has taken to get to this moment in the legalization movement.\n\nWe believe it would be a huge mistake to shy away from doing the necessary groundwork to ensure that we actually access the tangible economic and sociopolitical benefits that the industry can offer our communities.\n\nWhether an individual chooses personally to consume the plant or not, it is hard to deny the opportunity we have to build something greater from this industry\u2014a legacy of intergenerational wealth and economic sustainability for black families and communities nationwide.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the Hood Incubator, the marijuana industry represents an opportunity for our communities to build tangible economic and political power.\n\nTR: This is not just about policy; it is about restorative and transformative justice\u2014and what you are doing is revolutionary. So many black people are still incarcerated, communities decimated, while white people reap the benefits of a narrative shift that has taken place on the backs of black folks. How important is abolition in your work?\n\nEI: As an organization we\u2019re deeply rooted in an understanding of the atrocities of mass incarceration and over-criminalization of black people. When it comes to marijuana, black people are four times more likely to be arrested for a cannabis-related offense then white people, despite equal rates of use across races.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur work is rooted in a commitment to creating the kind of future where prisons are completely unnecessary. We believe that people are inherently motivated to make positive contributions in society as long as they have all of the resources and support they need. If we can create the set of conditions where everyone has what they need, then we will have no need for a prison system. In our work, we center the principles of access, healing, opportunity and restorative justice.\n\nTR: Where do you see the Hood Incubator and the cannabis industry in five years?\n\nEI: In five years, we see the Hood Incubator operating nationally. Our growth strategy is to go deep in Oakland, in the Bay Area, and in California so we can learn what works, what doesn\u2019t work, and create models of best practice that can be replicated and implemented in cities and states around the country over the next five years. We want to play a key role in shaping what equity means in the marijuana industry, and we plan to support the various stakeholders\u2014community organizations, lawmakers, industry operators\u2014to be effective in the implementation of cannabis-equity initiatives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Hood Incubator is working to make sure that 20, 30 years down the line, when it is all said and done, our community doesn\u2019t have to look back and say, \u201cWhat a missed opportunity.\u201d\n\nWe don\u2019t want initiatives and frameworks that just sound good, we want frameworks that can fundamentally transform power dynamics and effectively turn the marijuana plant from a weapon that has been used to decimate black and under-resourced communities, into a tool that can help to repair the harms we have experienced from the drug war and mass incarceration.\n\nOur work is rooted in a commitment to creating the kind of future where prisons are completely unnecessary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Hood Incubator is working to make sure that 20, 30 years down the line, when it is all said and done, our community doesn\u2019t have to look back and say, \u201cWhat a missed opportunity.\u201d Instead, we will be proud of the work that we\u2019ve done collectively to shape the industry in a positive way that ensures justice and real economic opportunity for black and brown communities.\n\nClick here to support the Hood Incubator by becoming a monthly sustainer.\n\n", "keywords": ["ownership", "oakland", "industry", "communities", "marijuana", "brown", "drug", "cannabis", "empowers", "black", "work", "calif", "organization", "incubator", "hood"], "polarity": 0.10657730838765322, "subjectivity": 0.4662252243286725},

Why?\u201d\n\nNow, I find Ray J amusing on reality television. His battles with fidelity and not letting his wayward dick get in the way of his relationship with Princess Love makes great fodder for Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood. However, when it comes to Ray J as an artiste, it\u2019s been a smooth while since he\u2019s had a hit. Shoutout to the Neptunes and the legendary Kimberly Jones for \u201cWait a Minute.\u201d Shoutout to you folks who love \u201cI Wish.\u201d I\u2019ll even shout out you fans of \u201cI Hit It First.\u201d That song gets on my nerves, but I will acknowledge that it\u2019s catchy whenever played. (Spoiler: I haven\u2019t heard it played in forever.)\n\nStill, while I know these two are friends\u2014which explains how the two found themselves in the studio together\u2014it\u2019s so odd to randomly and suddenly be greeted with news that Sinbad\u2019s former co-star has dropped a mixtape with the dude who looks like Sinbad\u2019s son when he\u2019s eating regularly. Yet, here we are. But since I signed up for this sadism, here is a track-by-track review.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFuck Them Hoes\u201d\n\nOf course these niggas begin their project with a song called \u201cFuck Them Hoes.\u201d In the interest of fairness, I will say that the beat on this track slaps. That aside, how many songs does Brown have offering a faux apology about letting his dick slip and slide? To infinity and beyond is the answer. Then there\u2019s Ray J, who croons in a way best described as \u201cconstipated whisper.\u201d Perhaps \u201cconstipation\u201d is too extreme; if so, you can say he \u201csings\u201d in congestion and cigarettes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis song ain\u2019t it.\n\n\u201cAlready Love Her\u201d\n\nThis track sounds like everything we heard on the radio a few years ago, sonically. It\u2019s not a bad track, but it sounds very familiar to a bunch of other songs. Speaking of, like \u201cFuck Them Hoes,\u201d this song includes lines about codeine, ducking \u201choes\u201d and something about a Mercedes. And Ray J once again is doing that weird whisper where he sounds like his nicotine is low. What happened, beloved?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cCome Back\u201d\n\nIn the first few seconds of \u201cCome Back,\u201d I\u2019m reminded that Ray J could sort of sing once upon a time. This is not to say that he sounds particularly great, but William Ray Norwood Jr. is trying here, which, by default, does make him sound better than he does on most of Burn My Name.\n\nAs for Christopher Maurice Brown, he may be a fuckboy, depending on the California judge you\u2019re discussing him with, but he does make solid songs about fucking. \u201cCome Back\u201d sounds like every other sex song I\u2019ve heard Brown make with this tempo, but obviously, this man is stubborn and reluctant to embrace change.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSide Bitch\u201d\n\nOh, look, more melodic misogyny. \u201cSay you love me, bitch/You lying/Give your ass to all them niggas.\u201d Like many terrible men, Brown openly brags about screwing everyone, yet is vexed that some woman he\u2019s smashing is just as open as he is. So much of this man\u2019s music consists of \u201cWho hurt you?\u201d tunes, and this is peak Chris Brown.\n\n\u201cInterlude (Vince Staples)\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t care.\n\n\u201cCherry Red Vans\u201d\n\nThis song features Ray J singing as if his vocal coach were a bad-ass 12-year-old whose balls haven\u2019t completely dropped but are two lengthy bathroom trips away from doing so, \u201csinging\u201d the line, \u201cMy wife make a straight bitch wanna go dyke.\u201d Return this bullshit to sender.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNew Gang,\u201d Featuring LuvaBoy TJ and Truth KO\n\nIt\u2019s a lot of Blood references, which I\u2019m sure will be used in a future court case, \u2019cause Lord knows Brown can\u2019t get it together. In any event, this track should be called \u201cOvercompensation.\u201d It should also be skipped quickly.\n\n\u201cLet It Bang,\u201d Featuring Payso B, Jackie Long, Truth KO, Knotch\n\nRay J, weren\u2019t you on Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood talking about selling some scooters or some shit last season?

Speaking of, round of applause for Tran for the early success of TNT\u2019s Claws and getting that restraining order.\n\n\u201cBurn My Name,\u201d Featuring Bizzy Bone\n\nEarlier in the month, I was reminded that Bizzy Bone is still with us after it was reported that his former fiancee was granted a restraining order against him after he allegedly physically abused and harassed her. Now he\u2019s recording with Brown (who is now on restraining order No. 2) on the mixtape\u2019s title track, no less. As for said track, it, along with the mixtape overall, is as good as Brown\u2019s reputation and Ray J\u2019s name around the Kardashian-Jenner clan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe production on the track is cool, but this song might have been better served if it were called \u201cDamn, I Fucked Up\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m Sorry for Everything\u201d instead of being such a poorly constructed attempt at martyrdom.\n\nLike, why can\u2019t Brown go meet a nice therapist and anger-management coach who helps steer him in a less misogynistic direction and then introduces him to some producers who could help him make the really classic R&B album he\u2019s more than capable of delivering? He\u2019s at, like, Mitch McConnell levels of stubbornness and hostility.\n\nIn sum, if you have yet to bother to check out this mixtape, do yourself a favor: Stick with that.

To honor drug-policy reformers on the front lines, for Black History Month, the Drug Policy Alliance, in partnership with The Root, is bringing you the stories of four phenomenal people who have been instrumental in shaping conversations around drug policy and its lethal effects on black communities around the country. To launch the series, we spoke with Wanda James, CEO of the Denver-based cannabis dispensary SimplyPure. Next, we spoke with Columbia University professor Samuel K. Roberts Jr. about the history of the drug war and how it violently pierces black history in the United States. Here, we bring you the story of Susan Burton, founder and executive director of A New Way of Life Reentry Project.\n\n\n\nIn 1981, Susan Burton\u2019s 5-year-old son, her baby, ran into the street outside their home in South Los Angeles and was killed when a Los Angeles police officer struck him with his car.\n\n\n\nAnd he kept going.\n\n\u201cThe policeman never even stayed around,\u201d Burton, 64, told The Root. \u201cIt was almost like it was a hit-and-run. And all I knew is when I was sitting in the hospital, a whole army of police officers descended into the hospital.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey never ever ever even said, \u2018Ms. Burton, I\u2019m sorry,\u2019\u201d Burton said, hurt and anger still evident in her voice. \u201cAnd that just added, you know, another layer of pain and feeling like ... like, worthless that these people didn\u2019t even acknowledge me.\u201d\n\n\n\nBurton could not escape her grief, so she sought refuge in crack cocaine, the only relief she could find from an all-encompassing, debilitating pain that no mother should ever have to bear. And for nearly 20 years, she spiraled in addiction as she cycled in and out of prison on nonviolent drug charges.\n\n\n\nIn 1997, as Burton exited prison for the sixth time, a prison guard said, \u201cI\u2019ll see you back in a little while.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe would not return, but her road would not be easy.\n\n\n\nBurton could not find a job because of her criminal record. She could not access food stamps or housing assistance. Determined to stay drug-free despite the immense hardships she faced, she entered into a rehabilitation facility, and upon her release, a friend helped her find a job caring for an elderly woman.\n\n\n\nAnd a vision was born.\n\n\n\nBurton knew there were other women like her in need of assistance, love and support to navigate a world slowly killing them from the inside. So she began inviting women she knew who had been recently released from prison to stay at her home in South Los Angeles.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe transformed her home into a refuge, a warm place to heal and start over. In 2000 she incorporated her growing efforts into A New Way of Life Reentry Project, which currently assists 32 women and about four children re-enter society with the support system they need. Since 1998, the organization has helped more than 1,000 women discover a new way of life, serving about 60 women per year.\n\nBlack women, in particular, have to fight to be mothers in a white supremacist society we were not meant to survive free. We have to fight to raise our children in relative safety, to provide for them, to feed them and clothe them, to educate them, to love them in a society that threatens to snatch their lives away from us while we reach for them with desperate hands.\n\n\n\nSo, what happens when you compound these conditions with the carceral state and the drug war in which black women are primary targets, not simply adjacent to the criminalization of black men? What happens when we are pathologized as bad mothers, unstable mothers, unworthy mothers?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat happens when our lives become fathomless pits of institutionalized cruelty, grief and despair, and drugs offer the only fleeting relief available?\n\n\u201cEvery time I was released, I swore I wasn\u2019t going back,\u201d said Burton in a 2010 CNN interview. \u201cBut I know now that without the resources and support, it\u2019s next to impossible. ... If you don\u2019t have a new door to walk through, the only thing is the old door.\u201d\n\nIn the conversation below, Burton talks about the stigma placed on black mothers, the institutional barriers black women face trying to access freedom for themselves and, if they have them, for their children, and how whiteness functions with deliberate cruelty.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Root: Addiction and poverty are symptoms of the malignancy of white supremacy, but society, especially when it comes to black women, never wants to treat the disease, it wants to criminalize the people suffering from it. Speak to those issues that black women face on an intimate level.\n\nSusan Burton: What I see overall is poverty in this country treated as a weakness and people who are impoverished are used by other people to enhance their wealth. For instance, in my community, there are places with payday loans on every corner. There is over-policing and excessive use of force and just excessive police presence and lack of services, trauma services, services to address violence. So everything is always met with a gun or handcuffs by law enforcement.\n\n\n\nAnd I mean, there\u2019s just better ways to address the poverty, which is a symptom of everything else. Poverty produces symptoms of other things like drug use and violence. People want to escape through drug use. And instead of treating and supporting people to divert them from drug use or understanding that this is their body\u2014and what they put in their body you should not be able to control it or demonize it or criminalize it\u2014they are punished. Punishment on top of suffering.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: I completely respect and understand that this may be difficult for you to discuss, and I don\u2019t want to place an emotional burden on you at all. So, if we can, I\u2019d like to talk about your son. You began to self-medicate, and that path led you into the criminal-justice system?\n\n\n\nSB: When I was suffering the grief and loss of my son, you know, I medicated that. It felt like there was a, just a ball of nothing, nothingness, painful nothingness, in my center, and see, it was a policeman that killed my son. It was an LAPD detective that killed my son. I felt so angry and hurt that they never even acknowledged it, never even acknowledged me and what they took from me. My son.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: I\u2019m thinking right now about reproductive justice. You had an LAPD officer take your son from you, steal your son\u2019s life from you, from him, and then you have them killing us, gunning down our children in the streets, and then you have them criminalizing parents in these conditions that this white supremacist society\u2014that hates women, hates blackness, hates poverty\u2014creates in the first place. And then you have police officers with a license to kill.\n\n\n\nSB: Yes, and then, speaking on reproductive justice, they are locking us up in our reproductive years. So many men and women are locked up through their reproductive years. It\u2019s genocidal, what they\u2019re doing. And out here in California, 6 percent of the overall population is black women, but black women make up 29 percent of the prison population. It is genocidal.\n\n\n\n(Editor\u2019s note: From fiscal years 2005-06 to 2012-13, the state of California sterilized women without proper consent, a state audit found. At least 35 black women were sterilized during this time period, but the number is potentially much higher. Most of the women who were coerced into undergoing tubal ligation had low education levels and had been pregnant multiple times. California banned forced sterilization in 1979.)\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: Also, the system is so quick to label black women as \u201cbad mothers.\u201d\n\n\n\nSB: Exactly. I have a woman here, Ingrid, who just got out of prison. She ran into the store to grab milk and Pampers for her baby, and came back out and got arrested for child endangerment. She was sent to prison for three years. Still in the midst, I believe that what she was suffering from was postpartum depression. The way black women with mental-health issues are treated in this country is just horrible.\n\n\n\nTR: Some years ago, I reported on a black mother, Frankea Dabbs, who was clearly suffering from mental illness after experiencing immense trauma in her life. She left her 10-month-old daughter on a subway platform and was instantly vilified. But we have white women who kill their children and empathy is widespread. And, according to a 2009 study conducted by the U.S. National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health study:\n\n\n\nThe rates of mental-health problems are higher than average for black women because of psychological factors that result directly from their experience as black Americans. These experiences include racism, cultural alienation, and violence and sexual exploitation. ... African Americans in low-income, urban communities are at high risk for exposure to traumatic events, including having relatives murdered and their own experience with physical and sexual assaults, all of which are associated with the onset of post-traumatic stress syndrome and depression.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSB: And that depression, that grief, often leads to drug abuse, right? And you know, those drugs just didn\u2019t pop up in our community. They were sent to our community. I\u2019m really clear that, that the amount of drugs that came into our community didn\u2019t come in there by our community members. You know, this was a deliberate tearing apart of our black community. And everything they\u2019ve done to us has been deliberate.\n\nWhen I was suffering the grief and loss of my son, you know, I medicated that. It felt like there was a, just a ball of nothing, nothingness, painful nothingness, in my center.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd I\u2019m watching now, the opiate use by other folks and, all of a sudden, it\u2019s, \u201cOh, we have a health problem here.\u201d But with the cocaine use, we had a criminal problem. So I\u2019m watching that and saying, you know, this is what they do. This is what white folks do, you know, they criminalize black people, they offer support to other people. I\u2019ve watched the breaking down of our family structures through incarceration and separation and criminalization of our communities.\n\n\n\nI remember in a movie I saw, it may have been Roots, and I remember the woman saying, \u201cMaster, master please don\u2019t sell my baby. Master, master please, I\u2019ll do anything, don\u2019t take my baby.\u201d And I watch black women go through the court system and they say, \u201cJudge, judge, please let me have my baby back, I\u2019ll do anything. Judge, judge please let me have my baby back.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd because a woman is criminalized doesn\u2019t mean she is unfit or she\u2019s not a good mom. But I watch that judge, regardless of what that woman tries to do in dire, dire circumstances, not give that woman back custody of her child. And it\u2019s heart-wrenching and it\u2019s heartbreaking.\n\n\n\nSo many men and women are locked up through their reproductive years. It\u2019s genocidal what they\u2019re doing.\n\nTR: And that\u2019s another way the criminal injustice system robs black women of motherhood.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSB: So, what do you do? Where do you run to? That woman is pretty much powerless to do anything but curl up in a ball or self-medicate, right? So, you know, I know what it feels like to lose a child. But sometimes, it\u2019s that that child gets put in the foster care system and, many times, they end up feeling abandoned, no love, and they self-medicate that pain, too. I see the breaking, the criminalization, the hurt and the pain through these systems that is just, oh, it\u2019s unconscionable.\n\n\n\nTR: And that leverage is also used to assault black women, right? Sexual assault is the second-highest reported form of police brutality after excessive force, and women of color are more likely to be attacked. So, you look at someone like [former Oklahoma City Police Officer] Daniel Holtzclaw, who targeted women like you, with prior charges. He targeted black women that he knew were vulnerable, black women (and one black girl) who were fearful of the criminal-justice system, and he raped them.\n\n\n\nSB: This goes on, and I know that you know that to law enforcement, black women are criminal. At every level, they abuse women, whether it\u2019s rape, you know, whether it\u2019s strip searches, whether it\u2019s dehumanizing them. I walk into a jail now to visit women, and the women are trained to turn from me and look at the wall. And I just want to cry for them. So all of these are forms of violence and dehumanization. All of them.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: You said something earlier about how society should not police what people put into their bodies, and that\u2019s such an important point. We talk about the shame and the stigma attached to what is put into our bodies. They will criminalize the body; they will shackle the body, and they will do all these things to control us, as opposed to looking at this system that really needs to be broken, because it\u2019s functioning exactly as it\u2019s supposed to. They won\u2019t address poverty, but they\u2019ll police those living in poverty. They won\u2019t address public schools that are intentionally allowed to fail in the service of privatization, but they will keep the school-to-prison pipeline running smoothly.\n\n\n\nSB: That\u2019s exactly it. It is a system that needs to be interrupted. When I, when my son died, the grief, the pain that I was in, you know, I needed something to help me cope with that. I\u2019ve seen people in physical pain, and I\u2019ve seen people in dire mental distress. The level of grief I was in, I needed something to deal with that pain, that rage. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d have done to get through that. So I used drugs; I used until I found another solution.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was never offered help when I stood in front of the judge and told them what had happened in my life. They hit the gavel and sent me to prison, had me stripped down and inspected like a slave. Handcuffed and sent me to work for 8 cents an hour.\n\n\n\nI know that given my circumstances, there could have been services and trauma centers available to help me through such a difficult time, but there was not. So what I do now is free women up from that same system. If I can, I help them get their baby back; I do that. I take them to court. I write letters. I stand in front of that judge. I help them meet that court requirement.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause what I know is, I can\u2019t get my baby back, but I can help another woman get hers. I can\u2019t take back the years, the time stolen from me, but I can stop another woman from giving all of her years. And that\u2019s what I do.\n\n", "keywords": ["know", "women", "freedom", "susan", "war", "son", "drug", "drugs", "black", "system", "motherhood", "woman", "baby", "liberator", "burton", "prison"], "polarity": -0.05518481947605659, "subjectivity": 0.43063863971080474},

What I do believe is that tribal officials must create systems within our government that will foster transparency and accountability. The only way this can be done is by helping our elected officials and program heads to be more accessible to the media. I am giving away some industry secrets, but the functionality of our tribal government is that important.\n\n\u201cA more effective method of delivering information about the inner workings of any institution is through [unbiased] third-party journalists who are working for established media outlets. . . .\u201d\n\nShort Takes\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupport Journal-isms Go Fund Me page.\n\nJoin the list of supporters.\n\nRichard Prince\u2019s Journal-isms originates from Washington.

To honor drug-policy reformers on the front lines, for Black History Month, the Drug Policy Alliance, in partnership with The Root, is bringing you the stories of four phenomenal people who have been instrumental in shaping conversations around drug policy and its lethal effects on black communities around the country. To launch the series, we speak with Wanda James, CEO of the Denver-based cannabis dispensary Simply Pure.\n\nWanda James doesn\u2019t like to think of herself as \u201cthe first.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen somebody brought it to our attention at some point or another, it was completely shocking to me,\u201d James told The Root. \u201cI just don\u2019t think any black person should be the first and only in this industry in 2016. You know what I mean?\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s no shrugging off her history-smashing, future-shaping achievements.\n\nIn 2009 James, a former Navy lieutenant who served on former President Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 Finance Committee, and her husband, Scott Durrah, a renowned chef, opened the Apothecary of Colorado, becoming the first black people in Colorado to own a cannabis dispensary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey eventually sold Apothecary and opened Simply Pure Medicated Edibles, which serviced over 450 dispensaries and one hospice program. According to New Cannabis Ventures, James and Durrah \u201cwere the first Manufacturer of Infused Products (MIP) to build their own grow facility, cook with 100% flower, not trim, guaranteed consistency and potency, and operated out [of] a commercial kitchen with all highly trained chefs.\u201d\n\nThen a market shift occurred that demanded lower prices for highly potent edibles; so because James and Durrah did not want to compromise their products, they closed Simply Pure and continued to work toward the full legalization of marijuana.\n\n\n\nIn 2012, Colorado voted to legalize the recreational use of marijuana; now 27 other states and the District of Columbia have joined in the boom. With that hurdle behind them, James and Durrah reopened Simply Pure, a full-service cannabis dispensary that specializes in medical and recreational marijuana, in 2015. The groundbreaking dispensary boasts a creative menu, ranging from chocolate bars to gourmet cooking oils, making cannabis use both exciting and accessible.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile this accomplishment is remarkable in and of itself, it also positions James to continue to fight the war on drugs that has decimated so many families across the country. From their start owning restaurants in Denver and Santa Monica, Calif., to, in 2009, becoming the first black cannabis dispensary owners in Colorado, James and Durrah have been on the forefront of raising awareness about the \u201cGreen Rush\u201d and the wealth of opportunities for black and Latinx people.\n\n\n\nAs previously reported by The Root, blacks and Latinos are still being unfairly targeted and arrested on marijuana-related charges\u2014even though whites are more likely to sell drugs\u2014and many former felons are prohibited from participating in the nation\u2019s fastest-growing economy.\n\n\n\nJames was motivated to embark on her journey after learning that her brother, whom she didn\u2019t meet until she was 35 years old, received a 10-year sentence for 4.5 ounces of marijuana. Four years of that sentence was served picking cotton in Texas.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe and his mother went in front of the judge,\u201d James said in a 2016\n\nDemocracy Now! interview. \u201cThe judge made my brother a felon. My brother spent four-and-a-half years picking cotton for free in Texas. I always stop on that note, and I say it again: that my black brother\u2014my black, 17-year-old brother\u2014spent four-and-a-half years picking cotton for free in Texas to gain his freedom. That was in 1992, not 1892. This is absurd to me.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe harsh and pervasive reality of the slave-labor class embedded in our racist injustice system lit a flame within James that continues to burn bright.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn our interview, she talked about the white-male-dominated cannabis industry, the need not only to decriminalize and legalize marijuana but also to destigmatize it, the racial discrimination that exists in our judicial system, and why she is an out-and-proud pothead.\n\nThe Root: You are the first black woman to own and operate a marijuana dispensary. How has that been received?\n\n\n\nWanda James: You know what? It\u2019s been amazing. I personally have never had any necessarily negative backlash. We were raided once, which was terrifying, back in 2010. But even then, the response to our raid was congressmen, senators and elected officials all came out and immediately let law enforcement know that we were a legal agency. Law enforcement apologized, brought back all of our stuff.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo I have never, personally, had any negativity at all. But then again, I don\u2019t really allow anybody to come at me negative on this. I shut them down immediately when they even look like they want to start on whatever it is that they want to start on, and the facts are amazing things in shutting people down.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe facts are amazing things in shutting people down.\u201d\n\nTR: Speak a little bit to that. What are the typical things that you would say? Is it more talking about the stigma of it? And its dangers? What are some of the things that you have had to turn away or some of the negativity that you\u2019ve had to just not engage in?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWJ: Well, for example, right now we\u2019re in a battle with our City Council to allow for longer hours to open. One of the councilmen said he was concerned about his 8- and 12-year-old. Quite frankly, I\u2019m tired of that verbiage, and I\u2019m tired of dispensary owners feeling like we have to kowtow to the, you know, to the mommy lobby.\n\nYes, we want to have a product that does not get into children\u2019s hands, which is what we do as responsible business owners. But as for your children being out in the world where cannabis exists, that\u2019s a parental thing. You need to tell your children about cannabis, and about alcohol, and about too much sugar and about people that aren\u2019t nice. So the idea that it is cannabis business owners\u2019 job to make your world safe for your children is a ridiculous fallacy that no other business has to face.\n\n\n\nTR: That\u2019s a really good point. We interviewed [former NBA player] Al Harrington, and he\u2019s also trying to get into the cannabis industry, and he said one of his main goals was to employ more black and brown people, specifically those who have been affected by the drug war and locked up on marijuana charges, and put them to work, because it really is a gold rush. And black and brown people haven\u2019t been allowed to participate in that. Black people have been the ones primarily affected and criminalized for drug selling and using. Have you been intentional about employing people of color for that reason?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWJ: It\u2019s something that we\u2019re very intentional about. I mean, I look at people of color, I look at women, I look at veterans. I\u2019m a vet, I\u2019m a woman, I\u2019m a person of color. So all of those things are extremely important to me. I\u2019ve been doing this now since 2009.\n\nOne of the bigger issues that we have in this industry is when I do put out that I\u2019m hiring, I get 100 r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and two black people, or three Latinas. Very seldom do I get black people, specifically black women. So part of it needs to be on us to take the onus to stand up and jump into this industry instead of allowing people and naysayers to make us believe that this is not a good place for people of color to be.\n\n\n\nTR: I find that interesting for a couple of reasons, because one, you\u2019re absolutely right, but how do you feel that we can go about destigmatizing it in black communities? Does there need to be more outreach about it? Does it need to be made even clearer that this is a business opportunity, maybe going to different communities and talking about that?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWJ: Well, I think there needs to be outreach about it. But I also think that we need to get real, and all of the people that come to the dispensaries and all of the lawyers and all of the doctors and all of the elected officials that pretend like they don\u2019t know what weed is, and they don\u2019t smoke cannabis, need to come to the table and get real.\n\nOne of the things that I\u2019m really big on, because of my position and because what I\u2019ve done, and because I\u2019ve worked with former President Barack Obama, it\u2019s important for me to step out and say, \u201cYeah, I smoke cannabis.\u201d I\u2019ve been smoking cannabis since I was in college. I make no qualms about the fact that I would rather have a joint than a martini.\n\nI\u2019m very excited about my cannabis use. I\u2019m proud of my cannabis use. In the same way that ladies at lunch can talk about a fine merlot or a crisp chardonnay, I can break it down for you for what\u2019s an excellent Indica or a vibrant Sativa. It\u2019s time to get real about this.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI make no qualms about the fact that I would rather have a joint than a martini.\u201d\n\nTR: I absolutely agree, and this is one reason why your role is so significant in the context of black history. This is huge, you being a woman, you being a black woman. So when you look back over at the course of your career, what do you see your end goal being? When you look back over your career, what do you want to have seen accomplished? When they say Wanda James, what do you want your legacy to be?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWJ: It\u2019s interesting. We didn\u2019t enter this to be the first; nor did we think we were going to be the first; nor did it even appear at the time that we would have been the first. It\u2019s still surprising to me that during that time in 2009 and 2010, 2008, even before, how few black and brown people were fighting to get into the industry back then.\n\nI think that my role in this is significant because of the reasons that we just talked about. I have no shame about this. And when we talk about this, we have to talk about cannabis in terms of facts that here in Colorado, since legalization, we\u2019ve seen over an 80 percent decrease in arrests for cannabis. And guess who was getting arrested mostly for cannabis in Colorado beforehand? We have seen a decrease in drunk driving. We have seen a decrease in violent crimes. We have seen a flat, no increase, in teenage use.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe have seen a 25,000-person increase in jobs here in Colorado because of the cannabis industry. Or we\u2014let me put that better\u2014we\u2019ve started 25,000 jobs. So I think, when you start to look at black history, I can\u2019t believe that there are actually black elected officials going around the country trying to talk white folks out of legalizing. It\u2019s almost like saying, \u201cHey, continue to lock us up.\u201d Continue to keep focusing on, on the negative, especially when there is no negative to this plant.\n\nTR: But the arrest rates have lowered for white people in Colorado but have actually risen for black and Latino people, right?\n\n\n\nWJ: Well, the arrest rates have gone down for everybody [pdf]. Where it has gone up, and it has gone through the roof, is for people under the age of 21. And it\u2019s gone up almost 50 percent for black kids and down 9 percent for white kids. So what\u2019s happened here is corruption in law enforcement; since they can\u2019t arrest people over the age of 21, they\u2019ve decided to indoctrinate us early, and have now started arresting the kids.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd these are the important things that we have to look at in legislation, and as legalization increases across the nation. We have to make sure that some of these laws and these unattended consequences do not continue to happen.\n\nWe have to fight on every level. We have to talk about it on every level, but first and foremost, we need to get the elected officials that look like us on the right side of this\u2014and not just in Colorado, not just in Washington, not just in California, but all the way across the United States.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen you start to look at black history, I can\u2019t believe that there are actually black elected officials going around the country trying to talk white folks out of legalizing. It\u2019s almost like saying, \u2018Hey, continue to lock us up.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: I wish I could try your products, but I\u2019m in Mississippi. So, there is that.\n\n\n\nWJ: [Laughs.] See, that\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about, though! How obscene is it that an American in Mississippi will go to jail for standing on the corner and smoking a joint, and yet white boys here in Colorado are selling a billion dollars\u2019 worth of weed and no one\u2019s going to jail?\n\nAs a matter of fact, they\u2019re getting written up in Fortune magazine and Business Insider and Time magazine and all these different places. Yet a kid in Mississippi is going to jail? What sense does that make? None at all.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: And that goes back to what you said about stigma from within the community as well. People really need to be real about it, because people smoke. But no one wants to talk about it.\n\n\n\nWJ: It\u2019s ridiculous! Are there people in the world that can\u2019t deal with cannabis? Yes, there sure are. Are there people that can\u2019t deal with alcohol? Yes, there are. Is diabetes in our community, made worse by the food we eat, what\u2019s killing us the most? Yes, it is.

Maybe you dated one because you liked the way he called you \u201cking\u201d or \u201cqueen,\u201d before he chastised you for wearing your skirt too short, putting lye in your hair or\u2014and, no, I\u2019m not kidding about this\u2014getting so far away from your African roots that your body does unnatural, Eurocentric things like menstruate.\n\n\n\nPerhaps one of them called you a \u201cbed wench\u201d for refusing to go to see The Birth of a Nation, or maybe you just know someone who spent all his lotion money on copper ankhs and donations to Umar Johnson\u2019s mythical Hogwarts for black boys.\n\nThey are Hoteps.\n\nHoteps are people who have overdosed on \u201cPan-Afrikan\u201d ideologies they obtained by reading badly designed websites, Hidden Colors DVDs (yes, Hoteps still play DVDs) and poor-quality YouTube videos explaining Illuminati symbology to scary background music. Hotepness is unshakable because Hoteps don\u2019t read primary-sourced, peer-reviewed anything, and if you dispute any of their made-up dogma with actual facts, they can always dismiss it with, \u201cThat\u2019s what they want you to believe.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough they can be annoying, Hoteps pose no real danger to society, unless you have a loved one or family member ensnared in the Hotep world and you have to sit next to them at Thanksgiving.\n\nBut there is a new breed of Hotep growing larger and more powerful every day. We have ignored them for far too long, and now their underground community has grown into a global community that dominates politics and threatens to take over the entire world.\n\nThe white Hoteps.\n\nI call them TrumpPets.\n\nYes, when you take a closer look at the throng of the \u201calt-right,\u201d frustrated white \u201csilent majority,\u201d that makes up the base of Donald Trump supporters, you begin to see the parallels between Hotepery and the people who want to \u201cmake America great again.\u201d Let\u2019s take a look at their most similar characteristics:\n\n1. They love alternative facts.\n\nIf you sit down with Hoteps for a few minutes, they can explain Dr. Muyind\u00e8 Asibe\u2019s (or some other uncredentialed \u201cAfricanologist\u201d who studied with some of the greatest Hotep thinkers of our time) book that explains how there were no homosexuals in Africa and how we subsisted on the herbs of the earth, which is why our kids can\u2019t pay attention in school, and how we can cure herpes by burning sage and drinking a special herbal tea.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDid I mention the menstruation thing?\n\nMeanwhile, the \u201cracialists\u201d who support Trump believe that immigrants are streaming over the border to simultaneously steal the white man\u2019s jobs and drain the country by living off welfare. If you told them that more Mexicans have left the U.S. than have come here since 2009, they wouldn\u2019t believe you. If you told them that young white males are the largest unseen terrorist group in America, they\u2019d think you were a liar because they know in their hearts that Muslims are secretly planning to kill them and institute Shariah law.\n\nA full 67 percent of Trump voters think that unemployment increased during the Obama years, and 84 percent of Republicans believe voter fraud regularly occurs\u2014although there is no evidence to support it. They absolutely hate Obamacare, but they are cool with the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. They love their continent.\n\nMost people love their homeland. German people love Germany, and the Irish love Ireland. But Hoteps love Africa. The entire continent. They don\u2019t love the country or area from which their ancestors hail. They don\u2019t even love their specific tribe. All their facts come from stuff they learned about ancient Egypt, but it\u2019s all \u201cAfrican\u201d to them (also, please don\u2019t call it \u201cEgypt\u201d or \u201cAfrica\u201d\u2014it\u2019s \u201cKemet\u201d ... unless you meet a level 10 Hotep; then you have to take the vowels out and call it \u201cKMT\u201d). They love everything from Libya to Namibia\u2014it\u2019s all the same to them. If you tried to explain to them the logic of a Mexican loving Canada, they wouldn\u2019t listen, and you know why:\n\nBecause that\u2019s what they want you to think.\n\nLikewise, neo-Nazis believe the same thing about European culture. If you dare visit any white supremacist website, you will learn that everything good that exists in the world comes from Western civilization. According to them, the entire world\u2014especially people of color\u2014owes white people a debt of gratitude for civilizing the world, and inventing societies and economies and every positive force in history.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDie-hard Trump supporter Rep. Steven King (R-Iowa) even said during an interview on live TV during the Republican National Convention:\n\nSteve King: I\u2019d ask you to go back through history and figure out, where are these contributions that have been made by these other categories of people that you\u2019re talking about, where did any other subgroup of people contribute more to civilization?\u201d MSNBC host Chris Hayes: Than white people? SK: Than, than Western civilization itself. It\u2019s rooted in Western Europe, Eastern Europe and the United States of America and every place where the footprint of Christianity settled the world. That\u2019s all of Western civilization.\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. They love their \u201cqueens.\u201d\n\nThere are two steadfast rules in the commandments of Hotepery:\n\nYou must end every conversation with \u201cas\u00e9\u201d (pronounced \u201cah-shay\u201d). You must refer to all women as queens.\n\nBut the first course in Hotep community college is teaching their queens how to subjugate themselves. Queens don\u2019t wear tight jeans. Queens should learn how to cook and how to speak to their kings in soft, hushed tones. Most importantly, like all things based in patriarchy, queens must allow their kings to control their vaginas. They don\u2019t necessarily treat women like royalty, they just like the word. \u201cPeace, Queen\u201d just sounds better when a Hotep introduces himself after leaving his white girlfriend\u2019s house.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhite nationalists don\u2019t have commandments. They just have the \u201c14 words,\u201d which are supposed to make up the most important sentence to all white people:\n\nWe must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children.\n\nWhite nationalists are worried about \u201cwhite genocide\u201d\u2014the conspiracy theory that race-mixing and diversity will eventually eliminate the white race. It\u2019s one of the reasons this part of the conservative base is so anti-abortion. Its members believe they need to make as many white people as possible to keep up their population. And also Jesus. If you ask them why they are anti-birth control if they don\u2019t want women having abortions, they will cite their Christian values, but\u2014just like the Hoteps\u2014it comes down to one thing: the patriarchal need to control vaginas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. They support their charlatans.\n\nIf you\u2019re a charismatic public speaker but lack the comedic skills to do stand-up or poetry and don\u2019t want to preach, you should consider a career in the lucrative field of Hotep teaching. There are men, like the aforementioned Dr. Umar Johnson, who travel around the world bilking thousands of dollars out of well-meaning black people. You can invent an academic r\u00e9sum\u00e9 like he did, but it is not required. There are others on the Hotep speaking circuit who just \u201ctalk good.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Trump has no political experience. It turns out that his stellar academic record is made up, but he basically became president by going on a white Hotep tour\u2014gathering naive wypipo at rallies around the country. Even though we think the country is worried about our peach-faced president, it is actually quite the opposite. Republicans (the party of the TrumpPets) approve of the job he\u2019s doing by a whopping 83 percent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo the next time you see someone in a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d cap, you should know that that\u2019s the TrumpPet version of an African head wrap. Unlike Hoteps, their elbows and ankles don\u2019t get ashy, but like their bizarro-world cousins, they don\u2019t trust the establishment, facts or women. There are sure to be people (probably in the comments section below) who will dismiss this as an attack on people who are in tune with their culture. They will say this article unfairly paints people who voted for Trump as racist and people who support the \u201cPan-Afrikan\u201d movement as silly.\n\nBut that\u2019s just what they want you to believe.\n\nAs\u00e9.", "keywords": ["trumppets", "trump", "women", "dont", "white", "love", "hoteps", "hotep", "world", "thats", "believe"], "polarity": 0.09636873267825649, "subjectivity": 0.39279681958253393},

Following several seasons in which we\u2019ve seen an uptick in black models wearing their natural tresses on the runways, this season\u2019s presentations boasted a remarkable number of naturally coiffed models on the catwalks. Even labels that typically cater to more conservative consumers, such as Tory Burch and Bottega Veneta, featured not only black models but black models sporting their natural textures in a variety of lengths, shapes and styles.\n\nAnd while it may be tempting to call it a trend, considering the fact that the past year has seen women in the armed forces wholeheartedly embracing the natural-hair movement, more natural-hair moments than ever on the red carpet, and 2018\u2019s biggest film starring a primarily black and entirely naturally styled cast, it\u2019s safe to say that #TeamNatural has gained more than a toehold in popular culture.\n\nAs model Kristina Elise told fashion site PopSugar: \u201cFor me, leaving my hair natural for the runway is really important.

The speech painted a dystopian image of an America riddled with violent crime and promised a higher \u201ctooth-to-tail ratio\u201d in combating it.\n\nSessions\u2019 remarks gave criminal-justice-reform advocates plenty of reasons to worry: The thrust of the Department of Justice\u2019s efforts to curtail violent crime would focus on drug arrests and prosecution, including adding 40 new federal prosecutors, according to Fox 6 Milwaukee.\n\nSessions began by hyping up his boss, whose carnage-filled vision of America was mirrored in Sessions\u2019 own speech.\n\n\n\n\u201cPresident Trump was elected as the law-and-order president. He was elected to make America safe again and to have the backs of our men and women in blue,\u201d Sessions said, according to Fox 6 Milwaukee.\n\nHe also congratulated law enforcement on the 20-year decline in crime rates before harping on a recent two-year uptick in violent crime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat trend has reversed. The violent crime rate is up by nearly 7 percent. Robberies are up. Assaults are up nearly 10 percent,\u201d Sessions told the room. \u201cRape is up by nearly 11 percent. Murder is up by more than 20 percent.\u201d\n\nAbsent, of course, was any context for these numbers\u2014whether Sessions was talking about arrests or reports was unclear, for example. And an \u201cincrease in rape reports and arrests\u201d (which are notoriously under-reported anyway) doesn\u2019t necessarily indicate that more rapes are happening. Sessions also failed to mention that these increases, while troubling, are still low when viewed within the 20-year period Sessions had just praised.\n\nEarly reports from the Brennan Center for Justice (pdf) also indicate that 2017 may see a reduction in the violent-crime rate, which is being attributed to lower crime rates in Washington, D.C., and Chicago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSessions was unconcerned with the facts, though, choosing instead to push his favorite pet theories: that drug use is driving homicide rates and that aggressive policing and prosecution would rein in the problem.\n\nCiting a 2015 DOJ study, Sessions told Milwaukee law enforcement that \u201cnearly a quarter of the increase in homicides\u201d were drug-related.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s why I keep saying that drug trafficking is an inherently violent business,\u201d Sessions added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSessions didn\u2019t mention how many of those homicides were carried out with a trafficked gun\u2014but why would he? He\u2019s repeatedly made clear that he has no interest in imposing harsher punishments for gun violations, because fidelity to the Second Amendment is more important than driving down the homicide rate.\n\nSessions also shared statistics about the increase in deaths from drug overdoses\u2014a tangent that mostly served to underscore Sessions\u2019 rationale for reigniting a war on drugs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd in case you were wondering how Sessions plans to bring violent crime rates to heel\u2014and who will suffer\u2014the attorney general made it abundantly clear in the following lines (emphasis mine):\n\nBut let me tell you this: we will not allow the progress made by our women and men in blue over the past two decades to simply slip through our fingers now. Plain and simple: We will not cede a community, a block, or a street corner to violent thugs or poison peddlers.\n\nThis is a call-to-arms for the law enforcement community to double down on drug offenders\u2014and the use of the word \u201cthugs\u201d here makes it very clear who\u2019s first on Sessions\u2019 list. That a nationwide increase in violent offenses has been exaggerated by the administration makes this all the more worrisome.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Tuesday, Sessions will be in North Carolina, where he\u2019s scheduled to formally announce the DOJ\u2019s strategies to combat violent crime.\n\nRead more at Fox 6 Milwaukee.", "keywords": ["continues", "enforcement", "crime", "dishonest", "violent", "increase", "nearly", "watch", "drug", "rates", "tour", "america", "law", "hook", "sessions", "safe"], "polarity": -0.05507908213790566, "subjectivity": 0.5412173556291204},

While this may seem like a result of the maturity of today\u2019s black celebrities, many attribute this year\u2019s lack of backstage donnybrooks to the presence of The Root\u2019s Danielle Belton and Yesha Callahan.\n\n\n\nEveryone knows they don\u2019t play.\n\nInstead of backstage donnybrooks, this year\u2019s antics were limited to the preshow ceremonies and the after-parties\u2014all involving the superstar upstart rap group Migos, who took it upon themselves to single-handedly fill the quota for celebrity shenanigans at BET\u2019s trap prom. The Root is here to answer all your questions about last night\u2019s melees between Migos and Joe Budden, Migos and Chris Brown, and Migos and intelligible lyrics.\n\nWho is Migos?\n\nMigos is a rap group made up of three guys from Lawrenceville, Ga., named Quavo, Offset and Takeoff, best known for the seminal hit song \u201cBad and Boujee,\u201d which\u2014if nothing else\u2014settled America\u2019s yearlong debate over what is the correct spelling for people who extend their pinkie when they drink Starbucks (except for members of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, who are exempt from pinkie-extending judgment\u2014because they\u2019re all boujee).\n\nWho is Joe Budden?\n\nJoe Budden is a rapper best known for his beard.\n\nJust his beard?\n\nWell, Budden is a great lyricist and battle rapper, but it is a very spectacular beard, which covers so much of his face that some people get nervous looking at him because they think he might get some beard in his eye. Even though Budden has been a respected rapper for years, he is best-known for his role on the reality show Love & Hip Hop. Plus, no one can actually name a Joe Budden album. When I Googled \u201cJoe Budden discography,\u201d Google told me, \u201cAye, bruh, let me get back to you on that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy did he get into a fight with Migos?\n\nAs a lyrical technician holding up the standard of hip-hop for over a decade, Budden has been a vocal critic of young rappers who make songs people actually buy. It\u2019s not that Budden is salty; it\u2019s that he can see the degradation of the quality in hip-hop over the years, and feels that groups like Migos and rappers like Lil Yachty contribute to the dumbing-down of the art form he loves.\n\nPlus, he\u2019s salty.\n\nBudden was on Complex magazine\u2019s show Everyday Struggle with DJ Akademiks when Budden threw down his microphone and stormed off the set in the middle of one of the stupidest, most inane conversations ever captured on video. But if you want to see it, here it is:\n\nThe New York Daily News reports that the group got into a chest-bumping and shoving match just out of camera range that was calmed down by bystanders. Afterward, Budden took to Twitter to explain why he couldn\u2019t contain his visceral look of disgust.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut why does Migos have beef with Chris Brown?\n\nFor the same reason all ninth-grade fights happen: Someone was trying to impress a girl. A member of Migos has reportedly been linked to Karrueche Tran.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOoh, is that the new model Ferrari coming out in 2018? I want to drive one of those Karrueche Trans with the turbo! They say they go 0-60 in 3.2 seconds, but I heard they are really expensive. Migos is balling like that?\n\nNo, Karrueche Tran is an Instagram model who recently broke up with Chris Brown and got a five-year restraining order against him because he threatened to go Chris Brown all over her ass. Tran is now reportedly dating Quavo, which may be the stupidest sentence I ever typed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrown was hosting a BET Awards after-party showing his new music video when someone from his crew punched Quavo and a fight ensued, according to TMZ. Los Angeles police surrounded the warring factions as Hennessy and blunt residue spilled everywhere, but video showed that it didn\u2019t get out of hand. Quavo didn\u2019t even ruffle his sequined crop top.\n\nThat\u2019s so terrible.\n\nActually, it\u2019s not. It marks major progress for the BET Awards. There have been much worse confrontations backstage in previous years. Remember the Rick Ross-Young Jeezy brawl? Remember when T.I. was arrested on the way to the BET Awards trying to buy enough guns to arm a small African country?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019ve had rappers die over beef like this. The fact that today\u2019s young stars are content to settle for slap fights and a few side eyes is pretty admirable.\n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking\u2014today\u2019s trap rappers are soft compared with the emcees from hip-hop\u2019s past\u2014but I don\u2019t think Migos are outlaws like that.

That\u2019s what they call us; those are the lies they tell about us.\n\n\n\nThe war on drugs\u2014a war on the most vulnerable and targeted black and brown communities in the United States of America\u2014shapes black history just as much as it shapes our present struggle for liberation from a white supremacist capitalist state. One cannot discuss black history in its entirety without discussing the war on drugs\u2014and dismantling that war will shape our future.\n\n\n\nIn 2013 this truth led Kassandra Frederique\u2014New York State director for the Drug Policy Alliance, visionary and 2016 The Root 100 honoree\u2014to create a series dedicated to drug-policy reformers to place the urgent need for justice squarely in the Black History Month narrative.\n\n\n\nAt its conception, DPA\u2019s Black History Month series was the birth of awareness for Frederique, who has been at the forefront of the war against drugs since 2009.\n\n\n\nIn February 2012, New York City Police Officer Richard Haste gunned down 18-year-old Ramarley Graham in his grandmother\u2019s home after targeting him on the street. Haste alleged that Graham was selling marijuana and used that unsubstantiated allegation as a rationalization for his cold-blooded execution.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen traces of THC, the chemical found in marijuana, were discovered in Trayvon Martin\u2019s system during the autopsy of his body, racists used that fact to justify George Zimmerman profiling, stalking and ultimately killing him on that rainy night in Sanford, Fla.\n\n\n\n\u201cI knew in that moment if we didn\u2019t connect the way the drug war was killing us, then we were complicit in disappearing their lives,\u201d Frederique says.\n\n\n\nShe\u2019s absolutely right. In 2015 the New York Times declared 1.5 million black men between the ages of 25 and 54 \u201cmissing.\u201d Because of early death and incarceration, there are 1.5 million more black women who are not behind bars than men in that age group. That disparity for whites is virtually nonexistent. One in every 13 black Americans has lost voting rights because of disenfranchisement laws. In 2014 the imprisonment rate for black American women was more than twice that of white women.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese oppressive conditions under an expanded police state can be traced directly to the so-called war on drugs, which is a systemic tool of enslavement. It has ravaged black and Latinx working-class communities, leaving white communities relatively unscathed. It has been positioned as a necessary response to crime and poverty when we know it to be a primary cause.\n\nFor Frederique, it has been critical to connect those dots for people who might not see the broader and deeper picture. And what better time than February?\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Black History Month project started out as an apology,\u201d Frederique tells The Root. \u201cFrom me to myself, to the future black drug-policy reformers that were on their way. I believed this narrative that what was happening to us\u2014incarceration, addiction, family destabilization\u2014was a result of us \u2018getting for what we asked for.\u2019\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI had always asked for a more definitive commitment from our movement on racial justice but I guess I always feared that they would throw back in my face that \u2018we did this,\u2019\u201d Frederique continues. \u201cI think back to my earlier years in this movement and wondered if I was assertive enough, if I asked all the questions that I needed to, did I study our movement hard enough.\n\n\n\n\u201cNow when I speak at forums, and attendees ask me what I think the role of black America was in the drug war, I reply, \u2018Yes, we wanted some of us to be locked up, but we also wanted treatment and we never got that part,\u2019\u201d she adds.\n\n\n\nTroubled History\n\nAs previously reported by The Root, when Bill Clinton\u2019s crime bill passed in 1994, it was with the help of 23 members of the Congressional Black Caucus who were expecting a reinvestment in the black community.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to that never happening, the bill was stripped of the Racial Justice Act, which would have allowed death row inmates to use data showing racial inequities in sentencing. The bill was also stripped of $3.3 billion\u2014two-thirds of it from prevention programs.

It just isn\u2019t all of it, and there is power in telling the full story,\u201d Frederique continues.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrederique also notes that it\u2019s important to recognize that drug-policy reform is not an industry of white saviors. It is so easy to believe otherwise, only because black pioneers have largely been erased from the conversation.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor the most part, we are meant to believe that benevolent white folks are how we got to where we are at now in our war against the war on drugs,\u201d she tells The Root.\n\n\n\n\u201cYes, there are tons of brave white drug-policy reformers who forged paths for the drug war to end, like Ethan Nadelmann, Craig Reinarman and Ira Glasser, but they all read Troy Duster\u2019s book,\u201d Frederique continues. \u201cBeny Primm mentored Deborah Peterson Small. There was and is a resistance that has always been black.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBlack people have been the most severely impacted by the war on drugs,\u201d Frederique adds. \u201cAnd in this moment when white faces have caused the nation to have a critical interrogation about what to do about drugs, black people need the whole story so, in the moment, that we can demand the necessary acknowledgment, atonement and action to build our communities.\u201d\n\n\n\nDrug policy is race policy. And to honor drug-policy reformers on the front lines, the Drug Policy Alliance, in partnership with The Root, is bringing you the stories of four phenomenal people who have been instrumental in shaping conversations around drug policy and its lethal effects on black communities around the country.\n\n\n\nWe begin next week with Wanda James, CEO of the Denver-based cannabis dispensary Simply Pure. James, the first black woman to own a cannabis dispensary, says that it\u2019s time for black America not only to look at the economic opportunities that the cannabis industry represents but also to do the necessary work of eradicating the stigma surrounding drug use: \u201cAll of the people that come to the dispensaries and all of the lawyers and all of the doctors and all of the elected officials that pretend like they don\u2019t know what weed is and they don\u2019t smoke cannabis need to come to the table and get real.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet\u2019s get real.", "keywords": ["narratives", "kassandra", "history", "white", "month", "drugpolicy", "series", "war", "talks", "frederique", "drug", "drugs", "visionary", "root", "owning", "black", "policy"], "polarity": 0.04329440400868974, "subjectivity": 0.4161604268747125},

Hate crimes against Muslims increased by 67 percent in 2015, the year in which Trump launched his campaign, according to FBI statistics.\n\n\u201cThe Year in Hate and Extremism\u201d is part of the spring 2017 issue of the SPLC\u2019s \u201cIntelligence Report\u201d and includes the Hate Map, showing the names, types and locations of hate groups across the country.\n\nFrom the SPLC:\n\nThe SPLC found that the number of hate groups operating in 2016 rose to 917\u2013up from 892 in 2015.

But as she tells Allure in its March issue, her own journey to choosing to wear her hair in its natural state was a very different one from the almost instantaneous success she enjoyed after being cast in her Oscar-winning role in 12 Years a Slave.\n\nAs a tween in Kenya, Nyong\u2019o was teased and felt \u201creally unpretty\u201d in comparison with her classmates\u2014who almost all wore their hair relaxed. Her mother wanted her to wait until near adulthood to relax her hair but eventually acquiesced to her daughter\u2019s pleas. Nyong\u2019o explains:\n\nShe took me to the salon in the middle of the school day, and I got my hair relaxed. I felt so much better because it was easier to tame. All the girls in my class had their hair relaxed. Very few had natural kink, so I felt a lot more acceptable. I had my hair relaxed for most of my teenage years, and that was a whole other world. The upkeep of relaxed hair is a commitment. It took styling it once a week and then having it retouched once a month. I remember doing crazy things, like sleeping with my head above the headboard so that my curls wouldn\u2019t get messed up for the next day. I\u2019d have these terrible neck aches because I was determined to keep my hair as pristine as possible. And it was super expensive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, Nyongo\u2019s conversion back to natural hair began in response to a joke from her father while she was asking him for money to support her relaxer habit: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just cut it all off?\u201d he said. She did, having her head shaved completely bald, a choice that she told Allure was \u201cliberating.\u201d\n\nBut the choice wasn\u2019t a cure-all; Nyong\u2019o struggled with managing her texture for years, especially after moving to the northeastern United States for college and graduate school:\n\nMoving to the U.S. was very difficult because I didn\u2019t have the same kind of support system. [Braiding] services were not readily available in Amherst, Massachusetts. For a long time I would braid my hair in Kenya and then spend months with the braids in when I got to the States so that I didn\u2019t have to worry about my hair. Also, my hair did something very different in freezing weather, which I didn\u2019t know how to handle. My hair needs moisture. It needs warmth. All of a sudden I was in this very cold environment, and my hair was bristly and dry and really hard to manage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd while it was Nyong\u2019o\u2019s work with famed stylist Ted Gibson that got many inspired about the versatility of natural hair, it was her current stylist, Vernon Franc\u0327ois, who helped her learn how to manage and care for her natural texture, thanks in large part to his eponymous line of products/ (Franc\u0327ois also provided some insight and tips on how he created the looks for Nyong\u2019o\u2019s Allure cover shoot.)\n\nNyong\u2019o says:\n\n\n\nOne thing I\u2019ve learned was the acronym LOC, and that\u2019s basically the rule for how to treat my hair: liquid, oil, and then cream. It\u2019s the idea that you wet your hair first, then you add oil so that it can trap the moisture in, then you put a moisturizer or a cream over it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNyong\u2019o says that this is the longest her hair has been in a decade. And while we\u2019re guessing that a few extras were added to create the cloudlike coifs she rocks in Allure\u2019s March issue, we\u2019re liking the look on her.

And when the time arrives for these hits to be carried out you\u2019re not going to see a C.I.A. agent with a suit and tie, and a badge that says C.I.A. walk up to someone, and pull the trigger. What they will do is to out-source to local police departments in the region of their target, and to employ those that look like the target of interest to infiltrate the workings in order to set up the environment for the eventual assassination (character, physical/incarceration, exile) to take place.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI immediately thought of young Malcolm\u2019s words when, on July 6, 2016, Philando Castile was killed in broad daylight by St. Anthony, Minn., Police Officer Jeronimo Yanez. I thought of his words not because I believe that Castile was specifically the target of a CIA plot, but because the public assassination of black humanity\u2014and the character of black people\u2014has been an ongoing project in this white-settler colonial project that flag wavers call the greatest country on earth.\n\n\n\nThe way we look, the way we talk, the way we attempt to live free in a country founded on our violent oppression, have all been reasons successfully used to render us \u201ckillable\u201d in the eyes of society and to justify our state-sanctioned lynchings.\n\n\u201c ... the character assassination before the physical assassination; so one has to be made killable before the eyes of the public in order for their eventual murder to then be deemed justifiable.\u201d \u2014Malcolm Shabazz\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack people are born into this world with targets on our backs and often leave this world the same way. Castile had already been pulled over an estimated 46 times before Yanez claimed that the 32-year-old man\u2019s \u201cwide-set nose\u201d made him look like a criminal suspect. Further, he was a legal gun owner in a nation that weaponizes blackness and steals black lives but loves steel weapons.\n\nWhen Castile calmly and respectfully explained that he had a gun in the car, the trigger-happy Yanez \u201cfeared for his life\u201d because a black man with a gun has always been viewed as a clear and present danger. This nation assigns us to that category so that state-sanctioned executions will be deemed necessary. And for those scarce times when blackness alone does not give officers a license to kill, marijuana smoke conjures up the rest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Washington Post reports:\n\n\u201cI thought, I was gonna die,\u201d Officer Jeronimo Yanez told investigators from the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension fifteen hours after the shooting. \u201cAnd I thought if he\u2019s, if he has the, the guts and the audacity to smoke marijuana in front of the five year old girl and risk her lungs and risk her life by giving her secondhand smoke and the front seat passenger doing the same thing then what, what care does he give about me. And, I let off the rounds and then after the rounds were off, the little girl was screaming.\u201d\n\nA wide-nosed black man in a car that allegedly smelled of marijuana had the audacity to carry a legal gun; that made him an enemy of the state.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKillable.\n\n\u201cThe war on drugs has been used to escalate a general sense that black people are beasts and that our communities are urban jungles,\u201d asha bandele, senior director of Drug Policy Alliance, told The Root.\n\n\u201cThroughout so many of these horrific police shootings, drugs have been used to justify the slaughter of innocents,\u201d bandele continued. \u201cWe saw it with Michael Brown, we saw it with Trayvon Martin, we saw it with shootings throughout the country, including that of Philando Castile. All you have to do is raise the specter of drugs, and supposedly no other question is supposed to be asked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSometimes when drugs are not the issue itself, the criminalization, the use of drugs, drug selling and drug use\u2014a criminalized feature in our nation\u2014is used to justify killing,\u201d bandele continued.\n\nKillable.\n\nBandele points out that the war on drugs is a living, breathing manifestation of the hatred this country holds for black people, and a cover for police hypermilitization and the occupation of black and brown communities.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOnce you declare something a war, you got to declare someone an enemy,\u201d bandele told The Root. The drug war has been used as a justification for police killings of 92-year-old grandmothers in their homes, where all they had to say was, \u2018Oops, wrong house.\u2019 It\u2019s been used to justify the killings of 7-year-old Aiyana Stanley-Jones.\n\n\u201cThis declaration of war and the continuous war crimes that shape this war directly led to the lynching of Philando Castile,\u201d bandele said.\n\nBandele, like Malcolm Shabazz, was also clear that sometimes skinfolk are used to weed out members of the black community that some people find disposable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe need to understand how we contribute to deaths like Philando Castile\u2019s when we contribute to stigmatizing people, or determining who\u2019s a decent black person and who\u2019s not a decent black person,\u201d bandele said. \u201cWe may have, in progressive communities, a broader idea of who matters and who doesn\u2019t, but until we accept that every life has value and we see that in our communities, then we\u2019re almost participating in who they say they can kill, and who they can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nKillable.\n\nThis is why, bandele says, ending the war on drugs, dismantling white supremacy brick by brick and eradicating stigma is the necessary foundational work we need to engage in if we are ever to be free.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf we want to begin to roll back police militarization significantly, we have to work to end the drug war,\u201d bandele said. \u201cIf we want to disrupt a major tool that they can wield against us, in not only killing us, but them not being held accountable for killing us, we have to end the drug war. If we want to begin to disrupt extraordinary levels of black poverty, then we have to begin to end the drug war.\n\n\u201cIn doing that,\u201d bandele continued, \u201cwe will say, \u2018We\u2019re not going to spend money on over-incarceration or over-surveillance, or any of the other facets that make up mass criminalization. We\u2019re not going to have one more Philando Castile. Not on our watch.\u201d\n\nBandele gets to the root of the matter.\n\nBlack people have been shamed for financial poverty in a nation that is morally bankrupt; still, reparations for theft of our land, our labor and our lives is considered too much to ask for.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe are told that our lives come with white supremacist conditions. Young black men, women and gender-nonconforming people are corralled into deep pockets of destitution, then shot to death for trying to hustle their way out to some semblance of security and safety.\n\nThe so-called gentler war on drugs\u2014a necessary shift from draconian drug policies to something focused on health and humanity\u2014is not for us.\n\nWe are still under fire from heavy enemy artillary. We are still living in occupied territory. We are still considered \u201cwarm bodies\u201d to fill cold prisons and balance bloated budgets. We are still lynched in broad daylight in front of our children, and the allegation of marijuana smoke is more than enough for killers with badges to walk free.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause in the United States of America, to lynch a black person, state-sanctioned killers don\u2019t need a reason; all they need is an excuse.", "keywords": ["castile", "philando", "public", "humanity", "war", "used", "drug", "drugs", "bandele", "lynching", "assassination", "black", "way"], "polarity": 0.006691919191919194, "subjectivity": 0.4468664477285165},

I get that it\u2019s a thing for some to pile on BET, but, beloveds, y\u2019all will never be this gassed about the MTV Video Music Awards, the Billboard Awards, the Oscars or any other awards show.

Clearly, this was the first show without Stephen Hill at the helm. The show lasted 30 minutes longer than scheduled. I love my people and I love my people\u2019s awards show, but four hours is a long time\u2014especially when your preshow is two hours.\n\nMeanwhile, this show has suffered from technical difficulties from time to time in the past, but c\u2019mon, nah, you can\u2019t cue up a performance and then say, \u201cWait-wait-wait, let\u2019s have a do-over.\u201d Shoutout to SZA, though, for handling that with grace. Still, there seemed to be some occasional sound issues, and the cues were off. Also, who thought that conveyor belt or whatever you call that moving contraption was a good idea? So glad no Negro fell and proceeded to curse out Debra Lee and Co. before presenting a humanitarian award.\n\n\n\nAs for the host, Leslie Jones, my lord, is she blessed with the gift of volume. Very few people can make Mo\u2019Nique seem \u201clow energy\u201d by comparison, but that Leslie Jones\u2014whew, she could wake up half the world if she ever decided to sing \u201cOne Sweet Day\u201d in the shower.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGIF\n\nLike, I can hear her even here.\n\n\n\nIn any event, I was reminded that while I hated the time racist trolls picked on the Saturday Night Live cast member, her actual humor can be an acquired taste. She had some funny moments, but there was something amiss with her monologue and a few of those sketches. You could tell the crowd felt similarly at times, \u2019cause Jones got plenty o\u2019 church claps as she cracked jokes. But she looked nice in red, and she seemed extremely happy to be hosting. I\u2019m going to leave it on that note and wish her well should she get booked again.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOK, the performances.\n\n\n\nBruno Mars: As a performer, Puerto Rican Frankie Lymon is near perfection and in a league of his own. Funny enough, he had an entire arena of black folks cheering him on while a few on Twitter debated earlier whether or not he was guilty of \u201ccultural appropriation.\u201d Much like y\u2019all\u2019s president, Minute Maid Mao, folks learn terms and don\u2019t really know what they mean, yet use them anyway. The man\u2019s music may be derivative, but he respects black music and black culture and vocalizes that respect often, and obviously we know that otherwise he wouldn\u2019t have opened the BET Awards.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, as far as that lil\u2019 clip of him dozing off while Mary J. Blige performed, I don\u2019t think he was bored at all. No, no, he was just coming down. Off what? I doubt I\u2019m allowed to say anything else, so let\u2019s move along.\n\nMary J. Blige: I love her for beginning her set with that song that basically is one big fuck-you to her soon-to-be ex-husband, Kendu Isaacs. Isaacs went on Instagram after the performance to express his grievances and say he wants to talk to Mary. Kendu, we don\u2019t care, and we resent you for what you\u2019ve done to the Queen. Shoo, sucker. Shoo.\n\n\n\nThat said, I wish Blige had done \u201cGlow Up\u201d instead of \u201cLove Yourself.\u201d A$AP Rocky should start a beauty brand, though.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFuture: If you can\u2019t say \u201cPercocet, Molly, Percocet\u201d during a performance of \u201cMask Off,\u201d you have been officially sabotaged. The staging was sexy, though, and as a member of Future Hive, I feel obligated to say I still enjoyed everything for what it was. I also liked Kendrick Lamar dressed like a Negro League Jax Teller.\n\nBig Sean: Was that a Beyonc\u00e9 tribute? Even so, I appreciate Sammy Davis Jr. in snack form trying to offer more. Lord knows most rappers don\u2019t dare make as much effort.\n\nChris Brown: That song sounds like every other song he makes. Same for the performance. Light Ike danced down, but you know, heaven knows he needs a hug, new creative director and artistic direction. And did he violate his restraining order being there? Please advise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMigos: I thought I was sick of \u201cBad and Boujee\u201d until they performed it and I leaped from my seat to let my feathers fly freely. I love them. They are rock stars; stay mad, Hip-Hop Hannibal (Joe Budden).\n\n\n\nTrey Songz: Trey Songz is fine, but what were those vocals? Trey Songz is fine, but what was that song? Trey Songz is fine, but what happened?\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nXscape: I am very happy for them, especially Tiny. They all looked good, although I don\u2019t completely disagree with those that say they weren\u2019t all dressed for the same show. You got the sense that they had some sound issues because LaTocha Scott noticeably took her ear piece out midway. Either way, love them and loved their performance. They need to go on tour.\n\n\n\nEl DeBarge: Black people love George Michael, and El DeBarge seems to be locked in a closet and only let out when the BET Awards are on, so this pairing made sense.

He also didn\u2019t believe that the punishment should have been life in prison. But two prior low-level drug convictions ensured that in 2004, Ray would get the max with no possibility of parole.\n\n\n\nEven the judge called the thought of sentencing Ray to life \u201ccruel and unusual,\u201d and attempted to give him 324 months. However, at the end of the day, the judge\u2019s hands were tied because of the mandatory-minimum law.\n\n\u201cThat was a death sentence. I was good in the daytime on the compounds where I was incarcerated, when you get to go to the law library, rec yard, go eat, be around people. But when they lock that door at 8:45 and you\u2019re locked in your cell, you can feel that life sentence eating through you and killing you,\u201d Ray tells The Root. \u201cYou know that you\u2019re going to die in prison.\u201d\n\nWhat Evans Ray didn\u2019t know was that much like the judge, President Barack Obama also thought his sentence was unfair.\n\nOne of Obama\u2019s biggest legacies that cannot be undone is his robust use of his clemency power.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring his eight years in office, Obama commuted the prison sentences of some 1,715 people, more than any other president in history. He was insistent on correcting what he considered the systemic injustices of mandatory minimums\u2014the lengthy sentences imposed on small-time, first-time and/or nonviolent drug offenders\u2014and ultimately changed the lives of many suffering Americans who were given \u201cdeath sentences\u201d for little more than having drugs on their person.\n\nOne of the lives that Obama irrevocably changed was Ray\u2019s. Ray spent more than 12 years behind bars for his offense before receiving clemency from Obama in August 2016.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was hard to believe,\u201d Ray said, recalling the day he was notified of his pending freedom. \u201cI went in my cell, put my sign up, and got on my knees and cried and I prayed. And I thanked God for allowing me another privilege of freedom.\u201d\n\nMary Price, general counsel for Families Against Mandatory Minimums (FAMM), tells The Root that part of the problem with mandatory-minimum laws is that they \u201ctreat everybody the same.\u201d\n\nPrice explains, \u201cSo you may have somebody who is responsible for all those drugs and directing everybody else in all those drugs, being subjected to the very same sentence that the \u2018underling,\u2019 low-level person who has very little relationship to those drugs except to carry them across the border, for example, and get a few bucks in exchange.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMandatory minimums blur the distinction dramatically in terms of culpability and just in terms of individual justice. What they mean is that judges cannot waive the mandatory minimum and take account of a person\u2019s actual conduct, actual role, any kind of mitigating factors such as terrible upbringing,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt means that judges don\u2019t get to impose the sentence; rather, members of Congress do when they establish the mandatory minimum.\u201d\n\nAs the Obama administration started to throw around its weight in the clemency arena, Ray saw a sliver of hope. Gathering all his resources, he applied for clemency, noting that he met all the criteria for being considered. He reached out to District Judge Alexander Williams Jr., who had once attempted to refuse to impose the life sentence, to write a letter to Obama on his behalf.\n\nRay also reached out to Obama himself, telling the president how proud he was of his accomplishments and noting, \u201cI might not receive commutation, but just the thought of knowing I am in the loop has been an uplifting experience for me. Two years ago, I thought I would die in prison, however, it is the truth now, I can honestly say that prayers go up and blessings come down because I have been praying someone would shine a light on these unfair sentences.\u201d\n\nMuch to Ray\u2019s surprise, in July 2016 he received a letter from Obama himself, who thanked Ray for his letter, writing in part, \u201cI believe that all people, including those who have made mistakes\u2014even significant mistakes\u2014have the capacity to make the right choices and to have a positive impact on others.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was amazing enough that Obama reached out to him, but Ray\u2019s surprise doubled when in less than a month, he received another letter from the president, personally reaching out to tell Ray that he was granting his application for commutation.\n\nFast-forward to today and Evans Ray is now a free man. He was able to spend Halloween with his kids and other family members, taking his grandchild trick-or-treating.\n\nBut his mind is still with the people who are left on the inside serving unjustly long sentences. He hopes to start a nonprofit for re-entry, working with other individuals who have gotten clemency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI have to be an advocate for the guys that I left behind. I have a passion of speaking and helping people, and I can\u2019t forget those good men that have unfair sentences like mine,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd there are some good people in prison. Everybody\u2019s not blackhearted.\u201d\n\nFor now he\u2019s working for Community Empowerment Leadership Community, which provides job training and other services for inner-city Washington, D.C., youths, along with mentoring.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd he\u2019s looking forward to an overall sweeping change in the law that doesn\u2019t just depend on the clemency power of the president, even if future holders of the office happen to be as generous as Obama.\n\n\n\n\u201cCongress needs to take this mandatory-minimum law and give the judges more access to making a decision about an individual,\u201d he says. \u201cLet the judges make the decision. They wouldn\u2019t have gotten [their seats] if they were making bad decisions.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf Congress looks at a whole picture and not just part of the picture, then they would see that the death-sentence mandatory minimum that they have is just so unfair, so cruel,\u201d he adds. \u201cYou have to believe in second chances. ... You don\u2019t hear too much from any guys that receive clemency coming back to jail \u2019cause everybody doing the right thing.\u201d\n\n", "keywords": ["wants", "judges", "clemency", "sentence", "evans", "commuted", "help", "rays", "sentences", "mandatory", "thought", "president", "ray", "prison", "obama", "life"], "polarity": 0.02197191898278856, "subjectivity": 0.5055184348662609},

In most cases, the perpetrators were not afraid to commit these acts out in the open and in front of witnesses, and many of them invoked the name of Trump, indicating that the hate attacks stemmed in large part from his election.\n\nAccording to the SPLC, in the 10 days following the election, people experienced harassment at work, at school, at home, on the street, on public transportation, in their cars, in grocery stores and other places of business, and in places of worship. While the most common forms of attacks have been messages of intolerance via graffiti or verbal harassment, there have been a small number of violent physical interactions reported as well. There were even attacks directed at the Trump campaign and his supporters.\n\nThe SPLC sourced the 867 hate incidents they examined from the #ReportHate page on the SPLC website as well as media accounts. They did not include online harassment or incidents the authorities determined to be hoaxes. The group also acknowledged that the incidents it examined represent a mere fraction of the actual number of election-related hate incidents that have occurred since Nov. 8. In fact, the Bureau of Justice statistics estimates that two-thirds of hate crimes go unreported to police.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHate incidents have been reported in every state except Wyoming, North Dakota and South Dakota. California had the most reports at 99, and Rhode Island had the least with just one report.\n\nPublic spaces seemed to be the place where incidents were most reported, with K-12 school- and workplace/retail-related incidents coming in close with 183 and 162 incidents respectively.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere were 280 anti-immigrant incidents and 187 anti-black incidents reported, making them the most reported incidents, but anti-Semitic, anti-woman, white nationalist, anti-Muslim, anti-LGBT and anti-Trump attacks were included in the report as well.\n\nWhile there were 202 reported incidents on Nov. 9, the day after the election, the number of reported incidents declined over the 10 days following the election.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsidering that Trump ran on a platform of racism, xenophobia and misogyny, these numbers should not come as a surprise to anyone.

In fact, he\u2019s a pathological liar with a history of lying and then just nonchalantly acting as if what he\u2019s doing isn\u2019t lying.\n\n\n\nDuring one stretch from Jan 21. to Feb. 27, the New York Times found that the president lied publicly some 38 times. He lied about not being a fan of the Iraq War, which he totally was. He lied about how many times he appeared on Time magazine\u2019s cover; he claimed that he\u2019d been on the cover more than anyone else, but turns out he\u2019d been on the cover 15 times and former President Richard Nixon had appeared 55 times. He even lied about about two people getting shot in Chicago the same day President Barack Obama was in town making a speech; reports confirmed that no one was shot the day Obama delivered his speech.\n\nTrump lies; it\u2019s just what he does. While his lies are easily disproved, it\u2019s rare that he will readily admit that he lied, much less admit it to another world leader. The Washington Post got its hands on a fundraising speech Trump made Wednesday in which he openly admitted to making up claims during his meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. He just randomly spouted that the United States runs a trade deficit with Canada without even knowing whether that was true.\n\nHere\u2019s how the Post breaks down the audio of Trump speaking during a private event:\n\n\u201cTrudeau came to see me. He\u2019s a good guy, Justin. He said, \u2018No, no, we have no trade deficit with you, we have none. Donald, please,\u2019 \u201d Trump said, mimicking Trudeau. [...] \u201cNice guy, good-looking guy, comes in \u2014 \u2018Donald, we have no trade deficit.\u2019 He\u2019s very proud because everybody else, you know, we\u2019re getting killed. \u201c ... So, he\u2019s proud. I said, \u2018Wrong, Justin, you do.\u2019 I didn\u2019t even know. ... I had no idea. I just said, \u2018You\u2019re wrong.\u2019 You know why? Because we\u2019re so stupid. \u2026 And I thought they were smart. I said, \u2018You\u2019re wrong, Justin.\u2019 He said, \u2018Nope, we have no trade deficit.\u2019 I said, \u2018Well, in that case, I feel differently,\u2019 I said, \u2018but I don\u2019t believe it.\u2019 I sent one of our guys out, his guy, my guy, they went out, I said, \u2018Check, because I can\u2019t believe it.\u2019 \u2018Well, sir, you\u2019re actually right. We have no deficit, but that doesn\u2019t include energy and timber. \u2026 And when you do, we lose $17 billion a year.\u2019 It\u2019s incredible.\u201d The Office of the United States Trade Representative says the United States has a trade surplus with Canada. It reports that in 2016, the United States exported $12.5 billion more in goods and services than it imported from Canada, leading to a trade surplus, not a deficit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause Trump\u2019s a notorious liar who actually believes his own lies, he took to Twitter on Thursday to double down on his totally false and made-up accusation.\n\nBruce Heyman, the U.S. ambassador to Canada from 2014 to 2017, blasted Trump over his remarks, tweeting that the president was \u201ccreating a crisis where none existed,\u201d USA Today reports: \u201cLying to your friends only hurts the relationship. Canada has been there for us thru thick and thin. How can you casually damage this realtionship [sic]? Shame on you!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the tape obtained by the Post, Trump attacked the North American Free Trade Agreement, reached by the U.S., Canada and Mexico, which is currently being renegotiated. And he openly mocked other politicians for wanting to keep NAFTA. He called Mexico \u201cspoiled\u201d and added that Canada had outsmarted the United States. \u201cThe best deal is to terminate it and make a new deal,\u201d he said, according to USA Today.\n\nClearly, Trump doesn\u2019t understand how any of this works.

Whereas Rebel, with a woman orchestrating the beatdowns, struck more as a modern-day reimagining of the iconic Shaft (which Singleton revamped on the big screen with Samuel L. Jackson nearly 20 years ago), Snowfall raises the stakes considerably. Singleton, who co-created the series, aims to tell the story of one of the most devastating eras in modern black American history\u2014the crack cocaine period. And for the Los Angeles native, this story is very personal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFor me it\u2019s something that has affected so many different people\u2019s lives, that transition from cocaine being a recreational drug for the very well-to-do to it turning into crack, an epidemic that basically affected our communities with people being addicted and also selling, and also changing the drug laws so they can put a whole generation of us in prison,\u201d he told The Root exclusively via telephone during an Uber ride in L.A. \u201cSo it\u2019s really kind of a horror story as far as I\u2019m concerned because, when you talk about crack, it\u2019s like World War II for black people if you lived it.\n\n\u201cThey say it\u2019s the only thing that made black women leave their children,\u201d he says of the epidemic. \u201cSlavery didn\u2019t do it. Jim Crow didn\u2019t do it, but crack did it.\u201d\n\nA lot of Snowfall is a prequel to the crack plague. It\u2019s a different time, one with a slight touch of innocence. The music is even different. \u201cHip-hop hadn\u2019t hit yet,\u201d says Singleton of the early-\u201980s-era series. \u201cWe were all into funk records\u2014Gap Band, Lakeside, Rufus and Chaka Khan\u2014and that\u2019s what the show reflects.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe character of Franklin Saint, a star turn for England\u2019s latest theatrical import, Damson Idris, is a bright teenager who has forgone college away to stick close to his mother, Cissy Saint (The Wire alum Michael Hyatt). In addition to holding down a basic job, he sells weed for his uncle Jerome (Amin Joseph), his mother\u2019s brother. But Franklin has grander ambitions. Busing to a better school puts him in circles he never could have accessed. He sees an opportunity to grow rich in the new drug game with some of the purest cocaine around. Naivete is his biggest mistake, however.\n\nBecause it\u2019s L.A., there\u2019s a Latinx story to tell as well. At the same time Franklin is making moves, so is Lucia Villanueva, played by Emily Rios of Friday Night Lights and Breaking Bad fame. Daring to carve out a role for herself in the family\u2019s drug cartel, Lucia leans on Gustavo (Sergio Peris-Mencheta), a frustrated wrestler seeking a better life.\n\nAnd in the middle of it all is the CIA and the controversial claim that the federal agency helped finance the war in Nicaragua by flooding L.A.\u2019s black community with cheap and potent cocaine. Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Gary Webb exposed this connection in a three-part series that ran in the San Jose Mercury News in 1996 but was later discredited, and he was reportedly pushed out of journalism. Webb\u2019s 2004 death by two gunshots to the head was ruled a suicide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of stuff written about this time, especially on the West Coast,\u201d says Singleton. \u201cYou have stuff on the East Coast and definitely in the Latin culture, in South Florida.\u201d That didn\u2019t deter Singleton, his co-creator Eric Amadio and the rest of the team from telling a story that Singleton deems vital.\n\n\u201cPeople seem to think \u2018OK, hey, cocaine is so, so sexy, but crack, crack is not sexy. It\u2019s wack,\u201d he chuckles, without drowning out the seriousness of his words. \u201cCrack has never been sexy, but you\u2019re going to see that transition and how dangerous it gets getting into the game [in Snowfall]. Cocaine is always glamorized in certain ways, but this story has never ever been told before. Ever,\u201d he re-emphasizes.\n\nFX got a lot of our attention last year with the Emmy Award-winning series The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story, which garnered Singleton his first Emmy nomination for directing its critical \u201cRace Card\u201d episode. There is a cinematic feel to Snowfall that feeds the growing intensity of each episode. Snowfall also pushes the limits, explained Singleton. \u201cThere\u2019s partial nudity. There\u2019s cursing. It\u2019s a little more violent than usual,\u201d he noted while flanked by most of Snowfall\u2019s cast at last month\u2019s American Black Film Festival in Miami.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBack in L.A., Singleton dismisses descriptions of Snowfall as \u201cThe Wire meets Narcos,\u201d insisting that that\u2019s \u201can easy generalization,\u201d adding that Snowfall is \u201cnothing like either one of those shows.\u201d Although he emphasizes, \u201cthose are great shows,\u201d he says Snowfall is \u201cits own thing.\u201d\n\nSingleton will cop to Snowfall being \u201cthe ghetto Game of Thrones,\u201d crediting his largely unknown cast for helping him achieve that effect. \u201cThese new faces work so well because you don\u2019t know where it\u2019s going to go,\u201d he says. \u201cYou don\u2019t know who\u2019s expendable, who\u2019s going to make it through.\u201d\n\nSnowfall debuts Wednesday at 10 p.m. on FX.", "keywords": ["cocaine", "series", "overtook", "sexy", "drug", "singleton", "lot", "crack", "john", "theres", "black", "snowfall", "fx", "la"], "polarity": 0.08436494897338272, "subjectivity": 0.49774387593664693},

In the past four years, the third-generation hairstylist has been making her mark on Marvel films, leading the hair departments of the last two Captain America films, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 and, now, Black Panther.\n\nOf course, the Black Panther is a unique superhero, and Black Panther is already proving to be an exceptionally unique film, as Friend tells The Glow Up:\n\nI think Black Panther is\u2014I call it a stand-alone Marvel movie, even though Marvel still has a formula. But I feel like it\u2019s a stand-alone movie, especially for me, because I\u2019m a black woman, and [to do] the first black superhero, that was really an honor, in the sense [that] we\u2019re presenting all of this to the world. We had an important job to do, and I looked at it in a whole different way, because it represents my people. So I felt like, the weight of the world on me at some points, but in the greatest way\u2014that I had the opportunity to present us in the best possible light and put something on camera that\u2019s never been [seen]. So it\u2019s a great responsibility and it\u2019s a great challenge, but it\u2019s my greatest joy in doing it, also.\n\nRepresenting her people was paramount in Friend\u2019s mind as she approached the task of helping to bring Black Panther to life. To begin, she divided the film into three elements: traditional Africa, contemporary Africa and the futuristic Africa represented by the technologically advanced civilization that is Wakanda. In her research, she drew inspiration from everything from traditional African tribes like the Maasai and Zulu to the groundbreaking fashion statements we\u2019ve seen at Afropunk celebrations around the globe.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really taking and looking at traditional styles, traditional tribal looks, and seeing what we can make into a modern style,\u201d Friend says. \u201cI like to take, like, a period hairstyle and put it in a modern movie and just put a twist on it. For me, it\u2019s still about classic hairdressing and beautiful lines and silhouettes. That\u2019s how I design hair.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFriend has certainly had her share of experience with period styles, having also headed the hair departments of Miles Ahead, The Help, Django Unchained, Rock of Ages and Dreamgirls. But whether it\u2019s long and flowing or elaborately braided and twisted, one thing you won\u2019t see in Black Panther is any straightened hair. For Friend, natural hair textures were a major part of her contribution to the visual narrative.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a beautiful time where people are wearing their natural hair,\u201d she says. \u201cI mean, there [are] women everywhere who are like, \u2018Throw the pressing comb away, throw the relaxer away. I\u2019m going to wear my natural hair.\u2019 So that whole movement of the empowerment of the hair is there,\u201d Friend explains.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCreating a diverse universe of naturally styled characters involved a team highly skilled in styling, caring for and mimicking natural hairstyles, as in the case of Angela Bassett\u2019s glorious custom-made wig of 24-inch silvery locs, inspired in equal parts by writer Toni Morrison and director Ryan Coogler\u2019s mother, Joselyn.\n\nBut while Friend isn\u2019t playing favorites on the styles she created, she\u2019s already seeing the influence this film is having on our beauty and fashion choices. She\u2019s received countless raves on the twisted crop Lupita Nyong\u2019o rocks as Dora Milaje operative Nakia and graciously provided The Glow Up with the how-to (hint: The key is keeping it close to the scalp):\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the \u2018Wakanda knot\u2019\u2014because it is different than a Bantu knot,\u201d she tells us. \u201c[Because] basically, the hair is rolled down, kind of like a cinnamon roll. And then, once the hair is dried, then, we lifted it from there.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEducating other hairstylists is a huge part of Friend\u2019s career, as her greatest hope is to see more hairstylists performing at the top of their game. That\u2019s why she created Hair Scholars, a consortium of award-winning artists led by Friend in educating and preparing aspiring stylists to be the best at their craft and ready to work in the industry.\n\nFriend knows firsthand the value of having a talented team by her side. She credits her Black Panther team for being a large part of the inspiration and craftsmanship that we\u2019ll see on-screen next week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt just felt like our brains\u2014the brainpower was just so high, and the energy was so high, just because we got to create,\u201d she says. \u201cOr somebody\u2019s like, \u2018Well, let\u2019s try this.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018Let\u2019s try it!\u2019\n\n\u201cSo it was really great to have that think tank, where we could just be in there and be creating, and just really coming up with things on the fly ... just really having the momentum just to create original pieces that are going to stand the test of time on film,\u201d she continues.\n\nAnd of course, we couldn\u2019t end our conversation without asking Friend how it felt to be on the purple carpet for Black Panther\u2019s epic premiere in Los Angeles last week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe premiere was like, you know, it was like 2018 Coming to America\u2014like, it was for real. People took it all the way,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I think what it is too, is as black people, we have like\u2014especially now\u2014there\u2019s a sense of pride. People are wearing their hair natural. People are [saying] \u2018black excellence.\u2019 People are rising to the occasion, and I think this movie comes at the time where black people, we want to step forward; we want to be recognized.\n\n\u201cThis movie hits all the right notes for having a black superhero,\u201d she explains. \u201cI mean, at the end of the day, we all want to be superheroes, in whatever we do. If we\u2019re a mom, if we\u2019re a secretary, if we\u2019re a hairdresser\u2014whatever we do, we all want to be a superhero.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up tip: If you\u2019re an Los Angeles-based hair artist, you can join Camille Friend for a Hair Scholars master class at the \u201cHair and Makeup by ... \u201d Symposium on March 11 from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.", "keywords": ["meet", "think", "natural", "really", "traditional", "hair", "movie", "panther", "camille", "panthers", "friend", "designer", "hero", "black", "having", "teamsupernatural"], "polarity": 0.17398076259489295, "subjectivity": 0.5284920634920632},

The law specifically said that \u201clegalization of illegal drugs is an unconscionable surrender in the war on drugs.\u201d When it was reauthorized in 1998, Congress stipulated that no federal funds be used to study the legalization of marijuana or other Schedule I drugs and that the office had to \u201coppose any attempt to legalize\u201d cannabis.\n\nUnder Obama, officials in the department seriously considered ending the federal prohibition on marijuana. While they didn\u2019t consider making it legal and easily available, former ONDCP Deputy Director Thomas McLellan said that the office was \u201cin favor of decriminalizing but not legalizing.\u201d\n\nThe administration\u2019s hands were ultimately tied by the laws that made the office possible. \u201cIt forced the office to take a policy position that it may or may not agree to,\u201d said Michael Botticelli, former director of the drug czar\u2019s office. Botticelli added that the legislation \u201chamstrings you into a policy position that might be the policy of the day but that might change.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause of the language that created their office, ONDCP officials couldn\u2019t even give their honest opinion about marijuana legislation, which made them look either ignorant of the overwhelming research or hypocritical in the eyes of scientists, criminal-reform advocates and marijuana activists. They were forced to publicly advocate against studying the issue or considering alternatives.\n\nObama\u2019s drug-czar office was also concerned that decriminalization would obstruct its efforts to solve the opioid epidemic that was creeping across the country. Constrained by the letter of the law, the administration took a more nuanced approach. The Justice Department instructed prosecutors to seek the minimum penalty for nonviolent drug offenses. They advocated against mandatory minimums. They increased funding for treatment and education.\n\nWashington, D.C., offered a rare glimpse into the administration\u2019s stance, however. The D.C. City Council\u2019s laws must be approved by Congress, so when District residents voted to legalize marijuana, Botticelli said, \u201cI might not agree about legalization, but I do agree with our own ability to spend our own money the way that we want to.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe legalization of marijuana is not simply a topic of public health debate; it is also a social justice and criminal-reform issue. While studies show that blacks and whites use pot at about the same rate, the American Civil Liberties Union says that African Americans are about four times more likely to be arrested for possession. A 2013 University of Michigan study showed that blacks are twice as likely as whites to be charged with a crime that carries a mandatory minimum sentence in similar circumstances. The Sarasota Herald Tribune studied unequal sentencing in Florida and found:\n\nIn Manatee County, judges sentence whites convicted of felony drug possession to an average of five months behind bars. They give blacks with identical charges and records more than a year.\n\nThere is someone who could fix this. On May 15, Congress sent a bill to committee to reauthorize the ONDCP. Maybe the one person who could fix this will step in and pressure his party to end the idiocy that is marijuana prohibition. Or maybe he\u2019s too busy staying up late, snorting the new designer drug smuggled in from Russia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI think it\u2019s called Covfefe.\n\nRead the HuffPost report here.", "keywords": ["decriminalize", "wanted", "whites", "office", "federal", "marijuana", "drug", "ondcp", "drugs", "administration", "legalization", "officials", "policy", "obama"], "polarity": 0.06971458773784356, "subjectivity": 0.44185039766435114},

I\u2019ve known how to braid since I was 4 or 5, but what really inspired me to sculpt my hair is an Instagram photo album that I saw a year ago.

Hart also did not shy away from fiercely criticizing Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte, known for spearheading a deadly war on drugs in his country.\n\n\n\nDuterte became furious when reporters asked him about Hart\u2019s statements, calling Hart a \u201cfool\u201d and rejecting his research as nothing more than American \u201cbullshit.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c[Hart] said shabu does not damage the brain. That\u2019s why that son of a bitch who has gone crazy came here to make announcements,\u201d Duterte told Philstar. (\u201cShabu\u201d is a slang term used in Hong Kong, Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia to describe methamphetamine.)\n\nAgnes Callamard, the director of Global Freedom of Expression at Columbia University and a United Nations special rapporteur on extrajudicial executions, is an opponent of Duterte\u2019s drug war.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCallamard, who also spoke during the policy forum, quoted one of Hart\u2019s points on Twitter. This resulted in Duterte slamming her as being in collusion with \u201cthat black guy.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe should go [on] a honeymoon with that black guy, the American. I will pay for their travel,\u201d Duterte told reporters at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport. \u201cThey should be together and discuss.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to his decadeslong research on drug addiction, Hart has openly discussed his experimentation with methamphetamine. He has also been unrelenting in cutting through stigmatizing rhetoric that has, in large part, fueled the war on drugs. He never wavers in pointing out the similarities between the attention deficit hyperactivity disorder drug Adderall and meth, as well as presenting evidence that cocaine and tobacco have similar effects on the fetus.\n\nTwo of the above substances are legal: Adderall, which is beloved by Big Pharma, and tobacco, which has been legally pushed in black and brown communities (pdf) for decades while discriminatory drug policies\u2014specifically around crack and marijuana\u2014have been used to terrorize and occupy those same communities.\n\nHart fearlessly pushes back against respectability politics and shame in black communities, demanding a shift in dialogue that includes human beings having autonomy over what they put into their own bodies; following the data on what is dangerous to consume and in what quantities; realizing that not all drug use is problematic; zeroing in on the drug war as an intentional and institutional war on the most vulnerable, oppressed and marginalized communities both domestic and abroad; and calling out state violence, specifically hypermilitarized policing, as more dangerous for black people than drugs.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe most important conversation that I have with [my sons], in terms of drugs, is they are more likely to be arrested for drugs than their white friends,\u201d Hart said in conversation with asha bandele, senior director of the Drug Policy Alliance, during a Facebook Live chat on The Root.\n\n\u201cThe most potential negative impact or consequence is the police, not the drugs themselves,\u201d Hart continued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring the Drug Policy Alliance\u2019s 2016 partner-gathering at Columbia University, Hart also urged attendees not to be distracted by the simplistic, media-driven narrative of a \u201cgentler\u201d war on drugs.\n\n\u201cThey may be gentler on the [white] user, but black people are disproportionately arrested for the selling of opiates,\u201d Hart said. \u201cIn the U.S., it\u2019s comfortable to arrest black and brown bodies. Always pay attention to who\u2019s getting arrested.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf there is one thing that Hart always does, it\u2019s make it plain; being in the Philippines, of course, didn\u2019t change that.\n\nAccording to Reuters, Duterte signed an executive order in February authorizing the creation of the Interagency Committee on Anti-Illegal Drugs.\n\nICAD consists of at least 21 state agencies, from \u201cpolice, military and coast guard to health, education and social welfare.\u201d Though the government claims that the purpose of the multipronged agency is to rehabilitate users and suppress dealers large and small, it has disproportionately targeted impoverished communities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMore than 8,000 people have been killed since the drugs crackdown started eight months ago, 2,555 of them in what police say were shootouts during raids. [ICAD] says that 48,000 drugs suspects were arrested,\u201d Reuters reports. Duterte has reportedly threatened to kill more.\n\nSound familiar?\n\nBe clear: From the U.S., to Mexico, to Honduras, to Ghana, to Thailand, to the Philippines, the war on drugs is global.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a Democracy Now! interview, Hart talked about the death threats he received for unpacking the misleading rhetoric around shabu and for speaking out against Duterte\u2019s drug war in the Philippines.\n\nFrom Democracy Now!:\n\nWhen I was in the Philippines, the thing that I discovered is that it\u2019s a lot worse than I originally thought it was. Duterte operates in intimidation. And so, not only is he the problem, but there are other political officials who are afraid to speak out. They are the problem. And Duterte has taken a page out of the 1980s U.S. drug war in that he\u2019s using drugs to separate people, the issue of drugs to separate the poor people from the people who have means. And he is allowing or providing the environment so people could kill, as you pointed out, kill people who are engaged in drug use and in drug trafficking. And people are afraid to speak out against this wrong because Duterte has no qualms about having people\u2019s lives be threatened. In fact, I discovered that people are being killed for as little as $100. It ranges from about $100 to $500 to have someone killed. And so, actually, I left the Philippines early because my life was threatened because of me speaking out against what Duterte was saying about drugs and what he\u2019s doing. And so, we have it bad in the United States, but the Philippines, I have never seen anything like the Philippines.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSee the entire interview below:\n\nPredictably, neither Donald Trump nor anyone in his regime has repudiated Duterte\u2019s vile statements about Hart, a U.S. citizen; nor has he voiced any concern about the death threats the acclaimed scientist has received.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, Trump recently praised Duterte, gushed over their \u201cvery friendly\u201d conversations and invited him to the White House over vehement objections from human rights groups.\n\nGIven that Hart is equally vocal in his opposition to U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 blatant push to escalate the drug war in the United States, Trump\u2019s silence should come as no surprise.\n\nTruth tellers such as Hart continue to put their lives on the line to end this inhumane war that has cost so many so much. History tells us that threats against black leaders deemed dangerous by those in power are rarely idle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe should all be thankful for Hart\u2019s life and his continued revolutionary work.", "keywords": ["speaking", "university", "guy", "duterte", "son", "war", "philippines", "drug", "drugs", "black", "president", "crazy", "hart", "neuroscientist", "policy", "threats", "gone"], "polarity": -0.03149721706864564, "subjectivity": 0.43651473922902484},

This casting decision raises important questions about black entertainment, mental health and the blind eye we turn to violence against women.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost of us were introduced to the fresh-faced Brown in 2005, when the then-15-year-old Tappahannock, Va., native and musical newcomer released the club hit \u201cRun it!\u201d Since then, Brown\u2019s career has been riddled with a series of arrests, court appearances and public incidents that raise questions about the 27-year-old\u2019s ability to take responsibility for himself and his actions.\n\nBrown\u2019s singing career has been essentially overshadowed by his violence against women.\n\nIn 2009, Brown pleaded guilty to felony assault and served five years of probation after viciously attacking singer Rihanna. Yet he didn\u2019t learn much from the experience. After the two \u201cmade amends,\u201d Brown still didn\u2019t seem to view the altercation as much more serious than a \u201cmistake.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust this month, Brown was served a restraining order after reportedly physically assaulting his ex-girlfriend Karrueche Tran. Her descriptions of the events that transpired between them include her claims of him \u201cpunching her in the stomach and pushing her down stairs.\u201d\n\nThese aren\u2019t mistakes. They are evidence of long-standing issues with violence against women that the superstar has somehow managed to maintain while nurturing his on-again, off-again singing career.\n\nSome have suggested that Brown\u2019s issues with violence against women stem from substance abuse. To this effect, a Billboard expos\u00e9 published earlier this month claims that Brown has a crippling addiction to serious drugs like lean (a mixture of \u201cpromethazine/codeine syrup and a soft drink\u201d), coke and Molly.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOthers have said that Brown\u2019s aggression can be attributed to post-traumatic stress disorder and bipolar II, both of which he was diagnosed with in 2014. But the fact is, many people live with and manage mental-health conditions like PTSD and bipolar disorder every single day without physically harming anyone else. Studies actually show that bipolar disorder is not linked to violence. Rather, it is substance abuse that fuels the fits of rage against others.\n\nSo, yes, this is complicated.\n\nOn the one hand, Brown continues to show that he does not intend to take responsibility for his actions or his repeated injuries of his romantic partners. On the other hand, he is clearly self-medicating, which likely causes his violent behavior.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIsn\u2019t it time we started asking his team some questions, though? Why do they continue to watch Brown as he ruins his own life and the lives of others around him? At what point do they have that come-to-Jesus meeting and check him on his behavior? These are the types of preventive (and loving) actions that his family and friends should be taking. But it seems as if they are just along for the ride (a point made by Crissle and Kid Fury on a recent episode of The Read).\n\nMost importantly, Brown joins a long line of black men\u2014like R. Kelly, Bill Cosby, Dr. Dre and many others\u2014whose artistic expression is often valued over their personal behavior. There are fans who would rather wear Beats by Dre than interrogate the irony of the brand\u2019s iconic name. They purchase tickets to awards shows and concerts where R. Kelly will perform, knowing full well that their money goes toward silencing the young black women and girls on Chicago\u2019s South Side who were reportedly sexually exploited by this man. These fans even say things like, \u201cBill Cosby has done so much for this community\u201d as Cosby himself admits to having drugged and sexually assaulted scores of women for decades.\n\n\n\nSimply put, there is no question that Brown has deep-seated issues with women and substance abuse. The two should not be seen as mutually exclusive. And what we shouldn\u2019t be doing is turning a blind eye to one in favor of the other, especially if it is only because we like his music.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Black-ish team must know this.\n\nAlthough the producers and showrunners haven\u2019t yet spoken out regarding the casting decision, one could interpret the choice as an effort to support the artist through his rehabilitation efforts. But as late as 2014, the singer was kicked out of a Malibu, Calif., rehab center for allegedly breaking several of its policies\u2014namely, getting \u201ctoo close\u201d to women. Later that year, Rolling Stone reported on the prospects of a BET-backed Brown reality show that would chronicle his life following his arrest and stint in rehab. While the show never saw the light of day, it seems as though some networks are still willing to support Brown\u2019s behaviors even as he fails to change.\n\nTo empower Brown with a guest-starring opportunity on such a prominent black show\u2014which, mind you, employs black female activists who have repeatedly spoken out on issues that women of color face in entertainment\u2014seems counterintuitive and disrespectful to viewers who hold the show in high esteem. No matter what the intention, this casting choice reeks of enabling. It provides a blank check for a clearly ill person to continue to inflict harm on himself and those around him. Meanwhile, it sends the message that virtually any behavior is easily forgiven when ratings are at stake.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPart of me wonders what the women on the show thought of this casting. I would expect Jenifer Lewis, Tracee Ellis Ross and Yara Shahidi to at least raise an eyebrow.\n\n\n\nWhile delivering a gorgeous acceptance speech at the 2017 Golden Globe Awards after winning for best actress in a TV comedy or musical series\u2014becoming the first black woman to win the award since 1983\u2014Ross said, \u201cIt is an honor to be on this show ... to continue expanding the way we are seen and known, and to show the magic and the beauty and the sameness of a story and stories that are outside where the industry usually looks.\u201d\n\nRoss hits on an important point here: Black-ish is such a powerful show mainly because it subverts the traditional storytelling and casting choices in Hollywood. It puts a quirky black family at the center of a universe and looks beyond the typical white veneer that has come to define so much of entertainment today.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith Brown\u2019s role on the show, Black-ish\u2019s producers run the risk of undermining these critical and hard-fought strides. While they are deliberately working against racial stereotypes through their full and vibrant depictions of black families, they still have an opportunity to tackle the nuances and complexities of gender and intimate-partner violence, especially where it concerns black women.\n\nBut casting Brown is a step backward. It proves that misogynoir and violence against women have still not registered with many leaders of industry as deal breakers for their faves. It is up to viewers to take to task the casting directors and the responsible parties behind this choice.\n\n\n\nWhat Brown needs is more (and better) people, not more casting credits. Until these record labels, networks and shows grapple with the equal importance of what these artists do both on and off the set, we must continue to hold them accountable.\n\n", "keywords": ["appearance", "browns", "guest", "women", "issues", "chris", "brown", "continue", "substance", "black", "casting", "singer", "blackish", "violence"], "polarity": 0.06144487200042756, "subjectivity": 0.49647560258671347},

Conwell prides her brand on providing undetectable, confidence-restoring solutions for women desperately in need, regularly giving one-on-one video consultations and even making hospital visits:\n\nI would say what drove my passion was when I started meeting women, and they were ashamed or in tears about their hair loss. And I would have women calling me sometimes saying, \u201cWill there be anyone else in the store? Can we meet alone? Can you come to my house and meet me? I don\u2019t even want to leave my house.\u201d And so, that\u2019s when I saw the seriousness of that. ... We have some pieces that are strictly for if you have alopecia, or are going through chemo with complete hair loss. Then, we have other pieces [for] if you have a head full of hair and want to sew your piece down, or you want to clip it down. ... [But] each time a consumer purchases from us, we always do a consultation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConwell is also fastidious about her suppliers, ensuring that she is never without a source of the highest-quality hair and that her vendors\u2019 preparation processes provide the best-possible experience for her clients, especially when many are already dealing with the stress of an illness. Says Conwell:\n\nI look for [the vendors\u2019] knowledge of hair. Are they familiar with cuticles? Are they familiar with steam-processing hair or do they chemically process hair? What will qualify a company is if they use steam processing\u2014we don\u2019t use any chemicals. Because companies that are using chemicals\u2014when you see some women patting their head, and their scalp is really itchy\u2014that is not a natural thing for extensions. People think that it\u2019s natural, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s usually that that company processes their hair extensions with chemicals, and you\u2019re having an allergic reaction to it ... And there\u2019s another tip with scalp itching: Don\u2019t use synthetic hair. Synthetic hair can make you itch, too. I always tell people: You want to use yarn to add in, instead of using synthetic hair. Dip it down in oil, and it\u2019ll keep your hair moisturized for your whole sew-in. A lot of people don\u2019t know that you don\u2019t have to use synthetic hair. ... But when you use quality hair, and no chemicals have been used, no itching on the scalp.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDesired Extensions also prides itself on providing a variety of textural options: In addition to offering standard straight, wavy, curly and relaxed textures, the brand stocks both kinky-curly and a tighter kinky-ringlet pattern and also offers custom matches. \u201cIf you see that we don\u2019t have a pattern that is your hair pattern, you send us in an image, and we can duplicate that,\u201d Conwell says. \u201cWe can duplicate any pattern, in any texture.\u201d\n\nCustomized wigs are also an option; they\u2019re available in various cap constructions, which Conwell\u2019s small staff of three will personally demonstrate and model via video chat, giving remote clients as close to a storefront experience as possible. Locally in Atlanta, clients can also book hair parties, where guests can play with Desired Extensions\u2019 product line and get much-needed advice on not only wigs and clip-ins but also protective options and hair-loss prevention. She says:\n\nA lot of people are getting away from sew-ins because they want to be versatile and change up their hair often\u2014if your hair is already braided, all you need is the wig to place on, and that alleviates the stylist. And then also, some people [are] complaining about losing their edges, [because] their braids are too tight; sometimes, you\u2019re getting the same braid pattern. When [clients] come to me and say that they\u2019re only losing hair around the edges, I always tell them it can be from stress, it can be from medication, and it can be from your stylist braiding your hair straight back on a regular\u2014you\u2019ve been getting your hair braided straight back like that for a year now. You need to change up your braid pattern at least every three months. That helps tremendously.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEducation\u2014and comfort\u2014are paramount to Conwell, who even consults with clients who can\u2019t afford to purchase from Desired Extensions. Because in the end, Conwell says, her priority is making women feel beautiful, especially when dealing with hair loss:", "keywords": ["loss", "lives", "women", "desired", "hair", "dont", "need", "changing", "tress", "pattern", "conwell", "clients", "extensions"], "polarity": 0.09807060755336619, "subjectivity": 0.4473443223443222},

The new guidelines state that \u201cprosecutors should charge and pursue the most serious, readily provable offense,\u201d later defining such offenses as \u201cthose that carry the most substantial ... sentence, including mandatory minimum sentences.\u201d\n\nBefore issuing the directive, Sessions informed federal prison officials that they should expect the rates of incarceration to rise, although the Justice Department did not elaborate on whether Sessions made the phone call while wearing his Klansman\u2019s hood or if he simply turned it to the side and listened through the eyeholes.\n\nThe policy is an about-face from the Obama-era Justice Department led by Holder. To avoid triggering mandatory minimums, Holder explicitly forbade prosecutors from reporting the quantity of drugs involved in cases with nonviolent offenders not affiliated with gangs or drug cartels. The Obama administration sought to reduce the federal prison population by ending the decadeslong war on drugs.\n\nA 2012 study by the University of Michigan Law School found that prosecutors were twice as likely to file charges carrying mandatory minimums against blacks (pdf) as they were against whites.

Leveraging their popular podcast into TV stardom, \u201cthe Bodega Boys\u201d riff on popular culture, politics and (mostly) white people. They\u2019ve become the popular destination for the coolest guests because their show is basically The Daily Show if Trevor Noah were a pair of weed-smoking, 40-ounce-drinking dudes from the Bronx, N.Y..\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Bodega Boys\u2019 beef with DJ Envy began when text messages surfaced of DJ Envy (who is married) chatting with someone who suggested butt play with the Power 105.1 FM host. As usual, Desus and Mero became the hood version of CNN, exposing the story:\n\nThe dispute continued when DJ Envy appeared on an episode of The Real with his wife, seemingly trying to contain the damage. The couple was very honest about the radio host\u2019s past indiscretions, making it appear that they had fixed all of their problems. Desus and Mero, who never shy away from controversy, made fun of the appearance by Envy and his wife because ... well, that\u2019s what they do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, on Thursday morning, Desus and Mero appeared on The Breakfast Club. Envy was in his feelings from the time the men walked in, and there was nothing wrong with that except the men didn\u2019t realize there was a beef.\n\n\n\nAfter introducing his guests as \u201cDickhead\u201d and \u201cPussy,\u201d which is mad passive-aggressive and totally light-skinned, Envy began to explain the impetus behind his beige rage. (Oh, did I mention that Envy was sporting a \u201cMy God vs. My Enemies\u201d hat, which was totally planned because isn\u2019t it just like a light-skinned man to wear passive-aggressive clothing to a fuss fight?)\n\n\u201cYou owe my wife an apology,\u201d Envy said to a baffled Desus and Mero. \u201cWhen you insinuated that she was there for the check.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen DJ Envy played the clip in which Desus and Mero totally insinuated that Envy\u2019s wife was sticking around for the check. Envy wasn\u2019t going full light-skinned for being mad about that. It was a low blow for the talk show guests to take shots at Envy\u2019s wife. Envy explained that wives and children were off-limits, and the guests agreed and apologized.\n\nWhere Envy drove his Jeep Grand Cherokee off the road (yes, Jeep Grand Cherokees are the preferred cars of light-skinned men; just ask any Kappa) was when he couldn\u2019t let it go. He literally stewed in his anger like a spoiled child unable to accept that he\u2019d actually gotten his way. Not sure if Envy came into work looking for a fight, but what he found was an apology, and that wasn\u2019t good enough.\n\nEnvy proceeded to hard-chew his gum (totally light-skinned and passive-aggressive), and make snide remarks before he went full Sinbad and walked off the show, undoing all of Matt Barnes\u2019 good work to dispel the myth that light-skinned men will walk off the air.\n\nAt that point, if Envy was still upset, he should\u2019ve reached across the table and taken a swing at Desus (because Mero is heavier; Dominican\u2014which means there is a 62 percent chance he had a razor under his tongue; and because I\u2019m not here for light-skinned-on-light-skinned crime).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know, because that is what rapper Casanova 2x would\u2019ve done. He is my spiritual guide whenever I\u2019m trying to sort out whether or not I\u2019m inside my light-skinned bag.

(And by \u201csources,\u201d I mean my imagination, which is definitely a source.)\n\nEnvy wasn\u2019t wrong for sticking up for his wife\u2019s honor.

In November, as the Post previously reported, she and her 7-year-old child presented themselves to border agents in San Diego, where they passed a screening interview with an asylum officer.\n\nHowever, days later, the daughter was forcibly taken from her mother and the two were placed in separate detention centers thousands of miles apart. The mother was detained in a center in San Diego; the daughter was shipped to a Chicago detention center, where she has been kept for the past four months.\n\nNow the mother has been released, but she has yet to receive word on the status of her daughter, with whom she\u2019s only had a few phone conversations since they were torn apart.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe stark details of the case\u2014immigration authorities have never provided any real justification for separating the mother and child\u2014prompted the American Civil Liberties Union to file a lawsuit against the U.S. government, charging that it violated the family\u2019s constitutional rights. The suit also calls for the two to be reunited immediately.\n\nSeparating a family seeking refuge is the sort of bureaucratic cruelty that\u2019s been the calling card of Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policy (while Barack Obama\u2019s track record on deportations is nothing to exalt, it was policy under his administration for women and children to be held together at detention centers). But as the Post\u2019s op-ed pointed out, what makes this case and others like it particularly heinous is that immigration officials can\u2019t get their stories straight about why they would separate parents from their child.\n\n\u201cA year ago, then-Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly said publicly that his department might separate children from parents caught crossing the border, including those fleeing violence and seeking asylum, as a punitive means of deterring others who might follow,\u201d the Post\u2019s editorial board wrote, adding that Kelly\u2019s successor, Kirstjen Nielsen, floated a similar idea again in December.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut DHS officials now claim that they would only separate minors from their parents for the child\u2019s protection. In the case of the Congolese mother and the ACLU lawsuit, one DHS official told the Post in a statement that the department doesn\u2019t \u201ccurrently have a policy of separating women and children,\u201d but noted that the department may do so, \u201cparticularly to protect a child from potential smuggling and trafficking activities.\u201d\n\nOf course, that clearly isn\u2019t the case for the Congolese mother and her daughter\u2014otherwise, why would the former have been released? For now, the administration is maintaining its silence on the matter, and the two still have no idea why they were separated, and whether they will be reunited.\n\n\u201cEach time S.S.\u201d\u2014the 7-year-old daughter\u2014\u201cis able to speak with her mother on the phone, she is crying,\u201d reads the ACLU lawsuit. \u201cEvery day that S.S. is separated from her mother causes her greater emotional and psychological harm and could potentially lead to permanent emotional trauma.\u201d", "keywords": ["detention", "torn", "immigration", "refuge", "case", "separate", "report", "policy", "parents", "lawsuit", "seeking", "daughter", "post", "border", "apart", "mother", "explain", "congolese"], "polarity": 0.038505747126436785, "subjectivity": 0.4295977011494253},

But just as frequently, my dreadlocks and scalp kick my ass just as hard as my fitness regimen. And when I try to recruit a new fitness buddy, I\u2019m frequently met with frustrating rejections because of worries about their tresses; whether they\u2019ve taken the chemically relaxed route to straighten their hair or are sporting their naturally kinky coils.\n\nAs a woman of color and a fitness nut, I want to eliminate some of the anxieties from your beauty regimen and incorporate great ways to get you back in the gym. If you\u2019re committed to getting fit, here are some sweat-ready hairstyles you may want to consider:\n\n\n\nBe Protective With Braids, Twists and Cornrows\n\nProtective styles such as braids and cornrows tend to be naturally low-maintenance. These styles minimize breakage from frequent styling or various heat applications, keeping your hair intact while you work it out. After kicking ass in the gym, consider unraveling your braids and sporting a twist-out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPull It Back in a Ponytail or Bun\n\nPonytails and buns are not only easy, but versatile. Pop that hair to one side for a fun \u201980s-inspired look, or go for a classic high bun for a night out on the town after releasing all of those endorphins. Or tap into old Hollywood with a playful twist, similar to this chignon on Rihanna.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSlay With a Short Do\n\nRegardless of what hair type you have, a short cut can accentuate your natural features while maintaining your chic. If done well, shorter hairstyles require less styling time than their longer counterparts. Tap into your inner Nefertiti with a fabulous high-top, or take your cues from Halle Berry and mimic her legendary gorgeous short haircuts.\n\n\n\nHide It in a Head Wrap\n\nPlenty of women\u2014including myself\u2014have embraced wearing head wraps because of their versatility and practicality. Interestingly enough, there\u2019s an abundance of head-wrap history in African and Afro-Brazilian culture. If you\u2019re curious, check out this Nigerian Ankara head-wrap tutorial, or follow Franchesca Ramsey\u2019s one-minute video on how to rock that printed scarf that\u2019s been collecting dust for months.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDevote Yourself to Dreadlocks\n\nDon\u2019t chop my head off. Yes, I did say I go through issues, too, but honestly, dreadlocks are very forgiving. However, please bear in mind that they are permanent. But like some of the aforementioned styles, you can cornrow your dreadlocks into braids, throw them into a sloppy bun or keep them in place with a stylish head wrap. If you don\u2019t want to commit, consider faux locs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBe Unbeweavable\n\nI didn\u2019t forget about my girls who love their sew-ins. While this is not just a tip for women who wear weaves, I heavily suggest wearing a headband or scarf to protect your edges. Wrap your hair and place a stocking cap on top before using a silk scarf or cap on top; that will allow you to protect your tresses and look presentable.\n\n\n\nBut wait: Here\u2019s a bit more info on protecting your hair while perfecting your health:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat to Do When Your Workout Is Done\n\nIf you have the ability, wash your hair with a good shampoo. When my locs require TLC, I prefer natural remedies, like soaking my hair for 10 minutes in an apple-cider vinegar wash to remove impurities from my locs. It\u2019s not something I\u2019d suggest doing all of the time\u2014doing this too much can screw up your hair\u2019s pH balance.\n\nIn between washes, using a dry shampoo on your roots goes a long way toward removing dirt and residue from your hair. After your workout, spritz your scalp with coconut oil, an olive oil sheen or even tea tree oil. For those who wear locs or braids, take it a step further by using peppermint or rosemary oil to remove any musty scents.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf your hair or scalp is damp underneath your sew-in, blow-dry your hair on a lower setting. A moist, sweaty scalp can lead to a foul odor and retain buildup, damaging your actual hair. And applying too much heat on a regular basis will cause hair breakage.\n\n\n\nRemember to alternate your hairstyles every now and then. Some days, I allow my hair to do its own thing. Brushing or pulling your hair in the same direction can cause traction alopecia over time\u2014and nobody has time for that.\n\nI may not have all of the answers to your specific hair-care needs, but at the intersection of beauty and fitness, I hope this aids you in getting back into a regimen that you love.\n\n", "keywords": ["tips", "braids", "enthusiast", "hair", "oil", "scalp", "scarf", "using", "styles", "haircare", "tresses", "head", "fitness", "short", "protect", "reluctant"], "polarity": 0.16237208147044208, "subjectivity": 0.4462535824830907},

Martin Luther King Jr.,\u201d Carruthers said emphatically.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt is sacred work,\u201d Carruthers continued. \u201cOur work is righteous.\u201d\n\nDeborah Small, a senior fellow at Johns Hopkins University, brought the house down with her keynote speech, \u201cDrug Policy Is a Human Right.\u201d I\u2019ve written previously about the connection between slavery and the war on drugs, but Small brilliantly took it back to the very beginning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis is a country that built their economy promoting addiction for profit,\u201d Small said.\n\n\u201cTobacco, sugar, rum,\u201d those were the first drugs, and plantation owners were the dealers. Enslaved Africans were forced to build the supply.\n\n\u201cBeasts of burdens, that\u2019s why we were brought here,\u201d Small said. \u201cThere is something perverse about being brought here [for that purpose] and then having everything taken away by addiction.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSmall also tackled rape as a foundation of slavery, and how that also fueled the drug war before it even had a name.\n\n\u201cWe were first forced to produce children we didn\u2019t want, and they took them and sold them to someone else,\u201d Small said. \u201cWhy as a community have we been willing to accept that for so many years?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOpting not to shy away from how victimization and complicity can go hand in hand, Small used the John Ridley film 12 Years a Slave to paint the picture.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere was a scene where [Solomon Northup] was hanging by a thread. They couldn\u2019t lynch him. [Other enslaved Africans] eventually started walking around going about their business because they believed they couldn\u2019t do anything,\u201d Small said to the hushed crowd. \u201cThat\u2019s conditioning, a legacy of slavery.\u201d\n\nIn an interview leading up to the Not One Step Back strategy session, bandele said that holding the event in Georgia held special significance.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe South has borne the brunt of mass incarceration,\u201d bandele said. \u201cDPA held a conference in Louisiana [the prison capital of the world] in 2007, and now we\u2019re coming back to the Deep South at a time when the U.S. attorney general is from Alabama. Black people are 32 percent of Georgia\u2019s population but 76 percent of those incarcerated for marijuana offenses. We\u2019re not taking one step back.\u201d\n\nMarc Lamont Hill moderated an important panel that took a deep dive into prison abolition and envisioning a nation beyond prisons and punishment. DPA\u2019s shift in strategy from focusing primarily on eradicating mass incarceration to encompassing the reverberating effects of mass criminalization of black, brown and poor people was a thread that was evident thoughout the session.\n\nClosing out the day was Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), who was greeted with thunderous applause. Waters pulled no punches, charging the Los Angeles Police Department with living on drug kingpin Rick Ross\u2019 payroll during the height of the crack epidemic, and for occupying and entrapping black and brown youths simply because they could.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey were just smoking a little grass, drinking a little 40 oz.,\u201d Waters said to brittle laughter weighed down by the truth of it all. \u201cThey weren\u2019t bothering anybody.\u201d\n\nJust as important as the brilliant panels, the deep community ties that are necessary to sustain this work were strengthened and forged anew. Several organizers spoke about the daily stresses that come with the territory, the feelings of depletion and failure, as more black and brown people are gunned down by police officers who claimed they \u201cfit the description.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe all-encompassing rage as more mothers are arrested, their children thrown into the foster care system, can sometimes become too much. The hot tears that fall as more fathers are thrown behind bars, then thrust back into society without access to employment or housing, can make the strongest person feel weak.\n\n\n\nBut what is so special about this gathering is that those fathers were there speaking for themselves. Those mothers were there speaking for themselves. Those drug users who were stripped of their freedom were there speaking for themselves. There was no judgment, just love, and the ever-present belief that we will win.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cALL OF US!\u201d shouted Dorsey Nunn at the conclusion of the weekend.\n\n\u201cOR NONE!\u201d shouted all of those gathered in response.\n\nAnd that revolutionary love is how we not only survive but thrive.\n\nThe Not One Step Back strategy session was sponsored by the Drug Policy Alliance, Georgia State University\u2019s Department of African American Studies, Morehouse School of Medicine, Amnesty International, the Ordinary People\u2019s Society, Self-Care Agency, SisterCARE Alliance, the Malcolm X Grassroots Movement and Peachtree NORML.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDPA will be in Atlanta again Oct. 11-14 for the International Drug Policy Reform Conference.

Because of his celebrity, though, Brown will never truly go away. Still, with his most recent disturbing headline, it\u2019s time to internalize En Vogue\u2019s \u201cGive It Up, Turn It Loose.\u201d We\u2019ll always have \u201cYo (Excuse Me Miss),\u201d \u201cTake You Down,\u201d \u201cDamage\u201d and \u201cFine China,\u201d but for those who continue to hold out hope that Brown will rise above his problems, it\u2019s time to pop, lock and drop into reality.\n\nOn Tuesday, TMZ reported that Brown\u2019s former girlfriend Karrueche Tran filed legal documents accusing Brown of threatening to kill her. Additionally, Tran claims that Brown has physically assaulted her in the past. And suddenly I now want to get up and do Soulja Boy\u2019s Superman dance.\n\nPer TMZ:\n\nKarrueche claims in a sworn statement to the judge, earlier this month Chris \u201ctold a few people that he was going to kill me.\u201d She then says Chris told the friends if he can\u2019t have her then no one else can, threatening he was going to \u201ctake me out\u201d and \u201cthreatened to shoot me.\u201d Karrueche also says several years ago Chris \u201cpunched me in my stomach twice,\u201d and \u201cpushed me down the stairs.\u201d This would have been during the time Chris was on probation for the Rihanna beating.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTran also claims that Brown has threatened her friends and recently threw a drink at one of them. So, not only is this man Light, Bright Ike, but he\u2019s part-time vintage Evelyn Lozada from Basketball Wives.\n\nIn any case, the judge granted said domestic violence restraining order, requiring Brown to stay 100 yards away from Tran, her mom and her brother.\n\nIn response, Brown took to Instagram to try to clear his name while simultaneously confirming your worst suspicions about his state of mind as he rambled rather incoherently. Forgoing a publicist and lawyer, Brown said, \u201cMake sure y\u2019all don\u2019t be listening to all this bullshit man. I don\u2019t know what the fuck they\u2019re talking about. Don\u2019t believe all that bullshit, bro.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis comments might have come across as more convincing had he not delivered them in a manner that recalls a kite flying high in the clear blue sky.\n\n\n\nOf the many problems Chris Brown has, one in particular is his unfortunate habit of documenting his bad decisions and erratic behavior for all to see. Less than a month ago, Brown took to Al Gore\u2019s internet and recorded himself sounding like the very violent menace his ex-girlfriend is accusing him to be. Do people not realize that when it comes to sharing videos on the internet, 1) we can see you and 2) the internet is forever?\n\nIn that now infamous clip in which he looked like the lost cousin of Kris Kross, Brown said:\n\n\n\nLadies y\u2019all be complaining about niggas being like stalkers, in love with y\u2019all, kinda crazy shit, and get tired of \u2019em. Well guess what? I\u2019m one of them niggas. If I love you, bitch, ain\u2019t nobody gon\u2019 have ya. I\u2019mma make ya miserable. I\u2019mma chase that nigga out, I\u2019mma chase yo ass around. Ladies, y\u2019all ever dealt with a nigga who just be blowin\u2019 your shit up? Hopping gates, stalking the fuck out of you, getting on your nerves? Well, shit. I\u2019m one of them niggas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd now he is being accused not only of additional physical abuse years after he beat another now-former girlfriend, Rihanna, but also of living up to the very abusive stalker he boldly professed himself to be on camera.\n\nFor years now, fans and other sympathizers have rallied behind Brown. Some have made excuses for his behavior. In many cases it was a matter of victim-blaming, though in others, Brown\u2019s having witnessed domestic violence as a child was cited as a reason to hold out hope that he would one day get himself together. That he would own his mistakes and ultimately overcome whatever internal demons and the childhood trauma that helped create them.\n\n\n\nBut as someone who is not unfamiliar with some of what Brown has spoken of previously, there comes a point when you realize that some people are simply stuck. Maybe critics\u2014self included\u2014were too harsh on him. Perhaps more people needed to give him a chance to redeem himself. There were instances in which it seemed as if Brown was damned if he did, damned if he didn\u2019t.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNevertheless, Brown has largely been the maker of his own madness.\n\nChris Brown never let go of the misogyny. In fact, he continued to profit from it in his music. Chris Brown remained defensive more often than not about his repeating the very cycle of abuse he was exposed to as a kid. Chris Brown never stopped battling people, be it online or in person. Chris Brown has exhibited violence for several years.\n\nBrown is a man of means; he has refused to use his blessings to become a better, happier and less terrorizing man. Brown can call Karrueche Tran\u2019s accusations \u201cbullshit,\u201d but he\u2019s given us countless examples of why we should believe every single thing she told that judge. Even now, I can recall the sight of Brown following Tran outside a club in 2015\u2014which at the time was reported to have resulted in an argument.\n\n\n\nLook at him. Look at her. Look at the fear in her eyes. Look at the traits of an abuser on full display without the slightest sign of shame.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI don\u2019t know what will become of Brown, but I do know that not a song in the world can excuse him anymore. Whatever emotional attachment people have to him because of his work, it is not enough when considering that he is on camera boasting about stalking someone for no other reason than her rightly deciding that he doesn\u2019t deserve her.\n\nBrown\u2019s debut album was released in 2005. We learned that he beat women in 2009. Seven years later, he\u2019s being accused of the same thing, and throughout these seven years, he has shown himself to be more like Eddie from The Five Heartbeats than Michael from the Jackson 5. Let him go.\n\n\n\nIf anything, now is the time to focus less on Brown\u2019s dedication to self-destruction and more on the havoc he brings to others who enter his space.\n\n", "keywords": ["told", "look", "yall", "dont", "man", "shit", "chris", "turner", "brown", "acting", "refuses", "stop", "bright", "light", "tran", "violence", "ike"], "polarity": 0.01653374711708045, "subjectivity": 0.48321102971102975},

But Trump has been gushing privately for weeks about using the death penalty in drug cases in which the user dies.

And how about an \u00fcber-talented hairdresser like Tym Wallace scrutinizing your every move via a super-closeup iPhone app for moviemakers? You would be flawless, that\u2019s what. Don\u2019t take my word for it, though; see for yourself when Proud Mary,\n\nTaraji P. Henson\u2019s latest star vehicle, hits the big screen today, Friday, Jan. 12.\n\nTo celebrate the film\u2019s release\u2014and all things hair\u2014Wallace, along with hair-care brand Creme of Nature, recently hosted a bevy of beauty editors in the penthouse suite of 60 Thompson, a sexy little boutique hotel in New York City\u2019s SoHo neighborhood.\n\nChampagne and high tea were served while Wallace\u2014who had just wrapped a publicity shoot in the adjacent suite of rooms\u2014emerged and took his place at the center of the circle to tell the tale of how he built the hair story for Henson\u2019s titular role as Mary. \u201cNot since Pam Grier have we seen a role like this on film,\u201d he said.\n\nClad in all black, with a razor-sharp brushed fade and a flute of Champagne at the end of his Yakuza sleeve-tattooed arm, he proceeded to hold court with a nod to the current national mood: \u201cIt\u2019s great to see women taking their power back,\u201d declared Wallace as the room raised their glasses in agreement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWallace\u2019s reading of the script for Proud Mary, directed by Babak Najafi, led him to create hairstyles so closely interwoven with the plot that he could scarcely reveal the number of hair changes, for fear of spoiler alerts. Wallace explained, \u201cContract killers move in mystery and in silence\u2014the outside world is not supposed to know the personality of a killer.\u201d\n\nThe role had many challenges: creating a look that was simultaneously fly, incognito and capable of standing up to the physical demands of Henson performing many of her own stunts. Wallace\u2019s tactic was simple: \u201cKeep it minimal,\u201d killing it with a series of high-end human-hair wigs.\n\nTo hold those $575-a-piece human-hair wigs in place during filming, his adhesive of choice was spirit gum, specifically from WM Creations in its matte finish. Wallace, who has been looking after Henson\u2019s tresses since the two met in 2015, does not like using glue for wigs; he feels it damages the hair and doesn\u2019t clean up easily with 99 percent alcohol, the way spirit gum does. He\u2019s a fan of buying French hairpins by the pound to secure wigs and pieces.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo matter what you\u2019re doing with your hair, Wallace maintains that edge care is a major issue\u2014certainly, removing and regluing wigs twice a day takes its toll. His No. 1 weapon in the war on edge erosion is his own \u201cspecial concoction\u201d of oils, including Jamaican black castor, jojoba, tea tree and coconut oils, adding a dash of lavender oil to neutralize the smell of the castor oil.\n\nAs for working with Henson, Wallace says she\u2019s the kind of client \u201cI prayed for. She\u2019s hilarious and she lets me do anything and everything to her hair.\u201d But one thing Wallace won\u2019t do is leave a weave in longer than two months without taking it out for a one-week breather and mandatory maintenance, which always includes trimming split ends. \u201cOne bad petal kills a whole flower; same for split ends in your hair.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe also cautions against braiding hair too tightly, citing an epidemic of traction alopecia he\u2019s been seeing lately, due to braiders who are so deft at their craft they can \u201ccatch and braid your eyebrows!\u201d\u2014a truth that made the room erupt in laughter. But Wallace got serious as he slid his signature glasses down his nose, peering sincerely at the editors gathered: \u201cTell your braider not to touch your edges, and give those braids some slack.\u201d\n\nFor everyday edge care, he advises using edge-taming products that don\u2019t list alcohol as the No. 1 ingredient. He also swears by tinted gels to boost the shine and luster of edges, giving that extra touch of #BlackGirlMagic. According to the Wallace gospel\u2014where hair is a \u201crelatable form of ministry\u201d\u2014tips for maintaining straight hair include using leave-in conditioner and heat-protectant products.\n\nNow in his 12th year as a hairdresser, he\u2019s happy to see that so many women have had a come-to-Jesus moment and joined the natural-hair movement. Says Wallace: \u201cWe have the best hair in the world. It does everything. All we have to do is protect it.\u201d\n\n", "keywords": ["killer", "proud", "edge", "making", "secrets", "tym", "hair", "tarajis", "wigs", "wallace", "using", "shares", "hes", "hensons", "world", "does", "stylist", "mary", "role"], "polarity": 0.24024927142574204, "subjectivity": 0.5239982457629516},

Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), 78, is small of stature but commands attention whenever she strides into a room. Her gaze is direct and inquisitive, with flashes of steely resolve serving as a clear reminder not to take her kindness for weakness.\n\n\n\n\u201cAuntie Maxine,\u201d the term of endearment that millennials have lovingly bestowed upon her, is amusingly accurate. You recognize this black woman because at some point in your life, you have been loved by a black woman who looks just like her. The black women who lovingly cleaned your scrapes and bruises, went to war on your behalf, but did not hesitate to get you all the way together when necessary.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWaters is experiencing a season of political pop-culture relevance, and it is easy to tell that the veteran educator, community organizer and politician is loving every moment of it. Her appreciation for her newfound national status is contagious. In an MSNBC interview with Waters, Joy-Ann Reid talked about Waters\u2019 \u201cone-woman resistance to the normalization of Donald Trump,\u201d and it is a role that the congresswoman from California\u2019s 43rd District takes extremely seriously.\n\n\n\n\u201cPeople in the coal-mine country who believed Trump, I want them to listen to who he is and what he\u2019s doing and how he lies every single day,\u201d Waters said to me as we sat across from each other Saturday afternoon in a conference room at Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey need to evaluate who they\u2019re going to vote for in the next presidential election based on everything they\u2019ve learned about what they shouldn\u2019t do,\u201d Waters said between sips of hot tea.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe dynamic congresswoman was there to keynote the Drug Policy Alliance\u2019s Not One Step Back strategy session, a community-building gathering not only to raise awareness about the war on drugs but also to hammer out ways to effectively fight Trump\u2019s regime\u2014which includes Confederacy and Ku Klux Klan sympathizer U.S. Attorney General Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III. Of course, Sessions and his supporters angrily claim that he fought to take down the KKK, but observers at the time\u2014and common sense\u2014say otherwise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Waters\u2019 resistance receipts go back so much further than this current administration.\n\nNo conversation about the political landscape of South Central Los Angeles is complete without talking about Maxine Moore Waters.\n\nThe most senior of the 12 black women currently serving in Congress and the former chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, Waters was first elected to the California Assembly in 1976, where she served for 14 years. She was then elected to be the U.S. representative for California\u2019s 29th Congressional District (Jan. 3, 1991-Jan. 3, 1993) before being redistricted to the 35th District (Jan. 3, 1993-Jan. 3, 2013). She ultimately landed in the 43th District in 2013.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn short, Waters is an OG in the political arena, and her fierce resistance to white supremacy goes much deeper and broader than Donald Trump.\n\n\n\nIn 1986, after a brutal seven-year battle, it was Waters who successfully led the state of California in the divestment of $8.3 billion of the state\u2019s pension funds from any companies doing business in apartheid South Africa.\n\n\n\nIn 1992, as Los Angeles erupted with revolutionary rage after LAPD officers beat Rodney King and got away with it, white mainstream media and politicians called it a \u201criot.\u201d It was Waters who said that social and economic conditions stemming from injustice sparked the uprising: \u201c[Riots] sounds like it was just a bunch of crazy people who went out and did bad things for no reason. I maintain it was somewhat understandable, if not acceptable. So I call it a rebellion.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1994, Waters was one of only 12 out of 39 members of the Congressional Black Caucus to vote against then-President Bill Clinton\u2019s crime bill, which, as I\u2019ve reported previously, was authored by then-Sen. Joe Biden (D-Del.) and voted on by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt).\n\nAfter the San Jose Mercury News\u2019 Gary Webb exposed the clandestine connection between President Ronald Reagan, the CIA and Nicaragua\u2019s Contras\u2014and how that \u201cdark alliance\u201d funneled guns and drugs into L.A.\u2019s black and brown communities\u2014it was Waters and Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) who demanded a full federal investigation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter whether [the CIA] delivered the kilo of cocaine themselves or turned their back on it to let somebody else do it,\u201d Waters said in 1997. \u201cThey\u2019re guilty just the same.\u201d\n\n\n\nWebb was later found with two bullets through his brain\u2014an unlikely \u201csuicide\u201d\u2014but Waters\u2019 fight to expose and eradicate the war on drugs, which targets black and brown communities, continues to this day, as evidenced by her presence at the Drug Policy Alliance strategy session.\n\n\n\nIn 1998, Republican leadership slipped through a bill to extradite freedom fighter Assata Shakur from Cuba, where she had sought political asylum\u2014and remains today. Waters mistakenly supported this bill because Shakur was listed not by her chosen name but by her former name, Joanne Chesimard. Once Waters realized this deception, she penned a letter to then-Cuban President Fidel Castro explaining what happened and clarifying her position:\n\n\n\nI oppose this measure is because I respect the right of Assata Shakur to seek political asylum. Assata Shakur has maintained that she was persecuted as a result of her political beliefs and political affiliations. [...] In a sad and shameful chapter of our history, during the 1960s and 1970s, many civil rights, Black Power and other politically active groups were secretly targeted by the FBI for prosecution based on their political beliefs. The groups and individuals targeted included Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Cesar Chavez, officials of the American Friends Service Committee, National Council of Churches and other civil rights, religious and peace movement leaders. However, the most vicious and reprehensible acts were taken against the leaders and organizations associated with the Black Power or Black Liberation Movement. Assata Shakur, was a member of the Black Panther Party, one of the leading groups associated with the Black Liberation Movement. The Black Panther Party was the primary target of U.S. domestic government political harassment and persecution during this era. This illegal, clandestine political persecution was wrong in 1973, and remains wrong today.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCome through, Auntie.\n\n\n\nWaters also opposed the Iraq War in 2009, when it was unpopular in some political circles to do so. With Waters\u2019 lengthy and consistent record of being on the right sight of history, despite all of the vitriol thrown in her direction, we began our wide-ranging conversation at the core: courage.\n\n\n\nThe Root: Congresswoman Waters, how do you sustain your courage, your conviction, in the face of so much rampant and perverse institutional violence? And when I say \u201cviolence,\u201d I\u2019m talking about the violence of silence, the violence of complicity, economic and systemic violence that says every single day that black lives do not matter?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaxine Waters: Well, you know, it\u2019s not something that I have to think about. I have 12 brothers and sisters. I came from St. Louis and I\u2019ve seen a lot of pain and poverty and people who never got a chance to realize their potential because of their circumstances. And so I\u2019ve always felt that there was injustice and that many people, particularly African Americans, didn\u2019t have a real chance.\n\nWhen I was little, we were on welfare at one point. Social workers would come to our home, and they were powerful. They could tell you what you could do, what you couldn\u2019t do; they would look in your refrigerator, look under the bed, all of that in the day. I thought at the time that I really wanted to be a social worker so that I could help people, because I saw exactly how they related to poor families. Later on in life, I learned that public policy was made by politicians. And I knew I wanted to be a part of the solution.\n\nTR: During the [Not One Step Back] \u201cStrength, Courage and Wisdom\u201d panel, Dr. Iva Carruthers, co-founder of the Samuel DeWiW Proctor Conference, said so powerfully that black mothers, particularly black mothers of sons, have to have courage each and every day. They have to have the courage to say, \u201cWe charge genocide.\u201d I agree, we must charge genocide, but I want to talk about what that means for our girls.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know you have a son and a daughter. Sexual assault is the second-most-reported form of police brutality. Black women have to navigate not only white supremacy, capitalism and state violence but patriarchy and misogyny, and how all of these things intersect. How do we, as Tarana Burke, senior director of programs for Girls for Gender Equity, says, continue to \u201cring the alarm\u201d for our black girls?\n\nMW: Well, let me just move forward a little bit before I talk about that. I really do believe that black women are really emerging as leaders in this country. I feel it, and I feel it in ways that continue to be unveiled every day. There is an emergence of black girls in our colleges and universities. I see young black women lawyers, and how good I feel about that.\n\nMy message to black girls is, you are special and you are important. Love yourself for who you are, how you look and move on. Do not be influenced or undermined or disparaged by others who would say that you are not enough or not who they want you to be. Black girls are equally as deserving of protection as black boys, and we must do our best to support them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of pain and poverty and people who never got a chance to realize their potential because of their circumstances. And so I\u2019ve always felt that there was injustice and that many people, particularly African Americans, didn\u2019t have a real chance.\u201d \u2014Maxine Waters\n\nTR: I know you were an assistant Head Start [a federally funded education program for low-income students] teacher in Watts in the 1960s during the Watts Rebellion. You\u2019ve said that you had mostly black teachers doing your formative years.\n\nMW: Yes, that\u2019s right.\n\nTR: So let\u2019s about the charter school experiment. I know the Democratic Party has had clashing views on that, leaning more toward supporting privatization under President Barack Obama, to now creating a more progressive education platform. Still, I wonder about this education experiment and how charter schools are framed as \u201cchoice.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s not so much the parent\u2019s choice as it\u2019s white supremacy\u2019s choice. Which black children get to jump through these hoops to be grateful tokens? Who gets pushed out? How important is it to you now, during this heightened moment of state violence, that in many ways is reflective of the climate during the Watts Rebellion, to focus on reinvesting in public education?\n\n\n\nMW: I\u2019ve been worried about the privatization of education and charter schools for quite some time, and I\u2019ve watched what has happened with charter schools and how they have been promoted by certain people in this country. Charter schools and private schools tend to cherry-pick, and they pick kids that they think are going to be successful anyway. And they pick kids that they believe are not going to be so-called problems.\n\nTR: I also look at Mayor Rahm Emanuel closing schools in Chicago and betting on pre-K education with Goldman Sachs and their tricky social-impact bonds. New Orleans is disappearing black school-age children, and black teachers are undervalued and underpaid ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMW: Well, I don\u2019t trust Rahm Emanuel; that\u2019s the first thing.\n\nTR: Hello!\n\n\n\nMW: And he\u2019s a politician\u2019s politician who knows the game very well. He raises tremendous sums of money; he\u2019s connected not only through the [Hillary] Clinton campaign and Barack Obama\u2019s campaign, but also his brother out in Hollywood, with the entertainment industry. The kinds of decisions that I think he has made in Chicago are decisions that do not bode well absolutely for the school system and for African Americans and for those kids out there involved with guns. He believes he has real involvement in the black community with people he\u2019s never talked to.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the things kids know, they know when you\u2019re afraid of them, and when you\u2019re real and when you\u2019re not. And if you\u2019re not afraid of them and you\u2019re willing to go, you can walk through any community and sit on any stoop. You get in a playground and just listen and just talk, and then be prepared to stand up for them at the right time. So this business of consolidating those schools, closing down schools, means Emanuel doesn\u2019t understand what communities are.\n\n\n\nTR: bell hooks taught us about the politics of location and the margins being a place of resistance. So I want to bring in the half of the country that didn\u2019t vote or voted third party. W.E.B. Du Bois said there are no two parties and only one evil exists. Malcolm X talked about the fox and the wolf. Angela Davis consistently teaches us that we need a new party. We see everything from the mass-incarceration boom under Bill Clinton to Obama\u2019s destabilization of Libya and the bombings in Yemen, Syria and Sudan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen we have an entrenched regional caste system where black folks in the Deep South don\u2019t have access to health care despite the Affordable Care Act. What do you say to those people who do not trust Democrats or a system that isn\u2019t broken but is working exactly as intended?\n\nMW: I understand the distrust, and I also do not like the way the traditional party has worked in so many ways. When you look at how the Democratic Party is organized and you go to the state central meetings or the county, you know, it does not represent America. There\u2019s room for change and improvement, but if change is to ever come, it will come from the people who don\u2019t like what they see, don\u2019t like what they\u2019re experiencing and believe that they have a right to lead.\n\nWhat is it about politics that makes you think that you have to depend on others, the ones who have done it traditionally, to be able to change it or to make it what you want it to be? Another party is possible if [people] are willing to work for another party. And if millennials are willing to challenge the Democratic Party and they\u2019re willing to say we\u2019re going to have our own conventions, that is possible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: There is a lot of talk about identity politics and \u201cthe white working class,\u201d as if white people in poverty have not been and are not today capable of viciousness. Whiteness is the most toxic identity. There are people invested in sustaining white supremacy on both sides of the aisle. Trump is just the current representative. How do we have an American reckoning, a resistance that lives beyond and encompasses more than 45?\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s room for change and improvement, but if change is to ever come, it will come from the people who don\u2019t like what they see, don\u2019t like what they\u2019re experiencing and believe that they have a right to lead.\u201d \u2014Maxine Waters\n\nMW: There are politicians, whether they\u2019re Democrats or Republicans, who have neglected their constituents in their neighborhoods. Still, we really do need to think seriously about how the result of that election is being analyzed and what people are saying about what happened, and all of that has been said about those who are dissatisfied with the Democratic Party. They\u2019re not talking about all the people who have fought in the civil rights movement for voting rights and civic participation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, if you\u2019re talking about small towns and you\u2019re talking about rural communities, most of those are represented by white men. What have these white men done for people in those small towns? What kind of public policy do they engage in on their behalf? I don\u2019t want us to see some big shift of where all of a sudden we\u2019ve done too much for [black people]; now we have to do something else, no. I hope those people who voted for Trump will come to their senses so that at 2018, they\u2019ll know better who to vote for at the local level and at the state level, and God willing, they will know that we need to get rid of him, out of office, now.\n\n\n\nAfter giving me a hug and chatting for a few minutes, Waters exited the conference room to go and give a 45-minute keynote address. She was met with thunderous applause. Afterward, she stood, in heels, for close to an hour shaking hands and taking pictures with young people who traveled to see their favorite auntie.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c[Waters] is probably safe for another 10 years,\u201d Rob Stutzman, former communications director of California\u2019s Republican Party, said gleefully in 2002 as redistricting threatened to upend her base constituency.\n\nHe\u2014like so many others\u2014was wrong.\n\nIf one thing is clear, Maxine Waters is also a warrior, as most black aunties are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd she\u2019s not going anywhere.", "keywords": ["oneonone", "know", "waters", "trump", "schools", "white", "party", "political", "bigger", "rep", "maxine", "black", "theyre", "exclusive", "youre", "violence"], "polarity": 0.04819279420343249, "subjectivity": 0.44555709066347393},

Akers has a sweet, unassuming manner; there\u2019s a genuine warmth to her that instantly puts the entire room at ease, yet also makes you ask yourself the uneasy question, is my #ootd as on point as hers?\n\nBesides having a keen eye for proportion and silhouette, top stylists like Akers share inside info with trend-forecasting companies like Fashion Snoops, which predict fashion\u2019s mood\u2014sexy or slouchy\u2014and what colors designers will choose to cut collections in for up to two years in the future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAkers and Lilly Berelovich, president of Fashion Snoops, greeted me at the door of a \u201cbreather room\u201d\u2014a kind of by-the-hour Airbnb arrangement for business suites.

Leveraging their popular podcast into TV stardom, \u201cthe Bodega Boys\u201d riff on popular culture, politics and (mostly) white people. They\u2019ve become the popular destination for the coolest guests because their show is basically The Daily Show if Trevor Noah were a pair of weed-smoking, 40-ounce-drinking dudes from the Bronx, N.Y..\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Bodega Boys\u2019 beef with DJ Envy began when text messages surfaced of DJ Envy (who is married) chatting with someone who suggested butt play with the Power 105.1 FM host. As usual, Desus and Mero became the hood version of CNN, exposing the story:\n\nThe dispute continued when DJ Envy appeared on an episode of The Real with his wife, seemingly trying to contain the damage. The couple was very honest about the radio host\u2019s past indiscretions, making it appear that they had fixed all of their problems. Desus and Mero, who never shy away from controversy, made fun of the appearance by Envy and his wife because ... well, that\u2019s what they do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, on Thursday morning, Desus and Mero appeared on The Breakfast Club. Envy was in his feelings from the time the men walked in, and there was nothing wrong with that except the men didn\u2019t realize there was a beef.\n\n\n\nAfter introducing his guests as \u201cDickhead\u201d and \u201cPussy,\u201d which is mad passive-aggressive and totally light-skinned, Envy began to explain the impetus behind his beige rage. (Oh, did I mention that Envy was sporting a \u201cMy God vs. My Enemies\u201d hat, which was totally planned because isn\u2019t it just like a light-skinned man to wear passive-aggressive clothing to a fuss fight?)\n\n\u201cYou owe my wife an apology,\u201d Envy said to a baffled Desus and Mero. \u201cWhen you insinuated that she was there for the check.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen DJ Envy played the clip in which Desus and Mero totally insinuated that Envy\u2019s wife was sticking around for the check. Envy wasn\u2019t going full light-skinned for being mad about that. It was a low blow for the talk show guests to take shots at Envy\u2019s wife. Envy explained that wives and children were off-limits, and the guests agreed and apologized.\n\nWhere Envy drove his Jeep Grand Cherokee off the road (yes, Jeep Grand Cherokees are the preferred cars of light-skinned men; just ask any Kappa) was when he couldn\u2019t let it go. He literally stewed in his anger like a spoiled child unable to accept that he\u2019d actually gotten his way. Not sure if Envy came into work looking for a fight, but what he found was an apology, and that wasn\u2019t good enough.\n\nEnvy proceeded to hard-chew his gum (totally light-skinned and passive-aggressive), and make snide remarks before he went full Sinbad and walked off the show, undoing all of Matt Barnes\u2019 good work to dispel the myth that light-skinned men will walk off the air.\n\nAt that point, if Envy was still upset, he should\u2019ve reached across the table and taken a swing at Desus (because Mero is heavier; Dominican\u2014which means there is a 62 percent chance he had a razor under his tongue; and because I\u2019m not here for light-skinned-on-light-skinned crime).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know, because that is what rapper Casanova 2x would\u2019ve done. He is my spiritual guide whenever I\u2019m trying to sort out whether or not I\u2019m inside my light-skinned bag. I can\u2019t see Casanova 2x pushing the microphone away and storming out of the interview after receiving an apology, if for no other reason than he made this song and you can\u2019t get passive-aggressive after rhyming that you would punch someone\u2019s teeth out.\n\nMy sources tell me that Envy walked off the air and into his office, where he took a few swings at the air and then curled up on the floor in the fetal position and had a good cry, and it was well-earned. (And by \u201csources,\u201d I mean my imagination, which is definitely a source.)\n\nEnvy wasn\u2019t wrong for sticking up for his wife\u2019s honor. That\u2019s the commendable part of what he did. Hell, owning up to his cheating on national radio and national television is a real look at grown-man shit. But come on, bruh, Vin Diesel didn\u2019t threaten to beat up Dwayne \u201cthe Rock\u201d Johnson in real life for you to match your hat to your emotions.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is only one way that Envy can undo this: He\u2019s going to have fight Charlamagne tha God in a caged death match or admit on air that he went full light-skinned and then apologize to his guests.\n\nOr, maybe, to redeem his credentials and escape the official censure at the next meeting of #TeamLightSkinned, he can go on Desus and Mero\u2019s show as a guest and fight them both.\n\nWatch out for the razor, though.", "keywords": ["men", "dj", "envy", "wife", "real", "history", "passiveaggressive", "walkoff", "desus", "radio", "envys", "mero", "moment", "tantrum", "lightskinned", "totally"], "polarity": 0.09482704402515722, "subjectivity": 0.5569444444444446},

The moment you sit in the chair and the stylist wraps the cape around you is the moment you begin to be magically transformed.\n\n\n\nBut the mythology\u2014and reality\u2014of black beauty shops isn\u2019t just about the stylists; it\u2019s the culture, the rhythm. It\u2019s the lady up the street who takes lunch and dinner soul food orders and the brotha with bootleg movies stopping through on a Saturday morning; the gospel music in some spots and the hip-hop or trap music in others. It\u2019s generations of women from one family either working in the shop or getting their hair done in that same shop. For many black women, the shop is a second home where we create family ties through nurturing our hair.\n\n\n\nWhen I saw Chris Rock\u2019s 2009 documentary Good Hair, I was surprised to learn that black hair care is a multibillion-dollar business. Most of us don\u2019t think about those numbers; what\u2019s always been most important to me\u2014as I\u2019m sure it is for other folks\u2014is to find a shop that aesthetically makes me feel comfortable and at home. I want to be in a place where the business practices are exceptional and the stylist cares about my hair. But for me, the black beauty shop experience is also complicated by my identities as a lesbian, butch woman and a black/biracial person.\n\nI grew up in the black church\u2014which meant long services, skeevy deacons, wilding-out preachers\u2019 kids (PKs) and older women who absolutely ran the church, regardless of the pastor. But one of the things I remember most from my religious education is that a woman\u2019s hair is her \u201ccrowning glory,\u201d which meant you had to be very cautious about how you cut or styled your hair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a kid, I had thick, curly locks that at one point extended down to my butt. People gushed over my hair, but quite frankly, I hated it. I never quite understood what to do with it, and it never held a relaxer like my friends\u2019 hair did.\n\nAs I got older, I felt even more alienated from black beauty shops because of my own relationship with race. I was adopted into a black family, so I had a clear understanding of my blackness from a very young age. But it wasn\u2019t until I was older that I began to explore the nuances of being light-skinned, black and also biracial. The push and pull of being accepted by black folk who weren\u2019t sure whether I was \u201cblack enough\u201d felt constant. And that push and pull extended to the relationship I had with my hair, and my identity as a butch woman.\n\nFor me, long hair was not part of my butch identity. It indicated a femininity that felt uncomfortable, and I needed a stylist and salon that understood and respected that. The choice to cut my hair was the most liberating feeling I\u2019d ever experienced, aside from coming out to the world and myself. But it took a long time for me to find the right person and the right shop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019ve been in hair salons with a heavy evangelical Christian energy, where people consider Harry Potter \u201cblack magic\u201d and implore folks to beware of the churches with rainbow flags, because that\u2019s where \u201cthose people\u201d go to church.\n\nI\u2019ve been in salons where the stylist criticized my hair just for being my hair. I\u2019ve been in salons where I was simply a number in a chair. And, of course, we\u2019ve all had a salon experience where your appointment is at 9 a.m. and you don\u2019t get out of the chair until 5 p.m.\n\nAt a certain point, I knew I needed a place with a mixture of great energy, client-centered service and stylists who wanted me to love my hair as much as they loved doing hair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was lucky to find Consciously Beautiful salon in St. Paul, Minn., through a friend who wears her hair natural in intricate braided styles. My relationship with stylist and owner Marla Smith is intense and intimate; she knows me almost as well as my partner of 18 years.\n\nShe was the first stylist to tell me that my hair has an actual identity (spiral corkscrew 3a), and the only stylist to identify my partner\u2019s formerly inflamed scalp as a sign of lactose intolerance and recommend that she lay off dairy for a while. Recently, she recommended that I use a little coconut oil before adding product so that my hair doesn\u2019t dry out in the harsh Minnesota winter.\n\nMarla says she decided to go into hair care because she wanted to do something she could be passionate about. And though she loves black women\u2019s hair, her clientele is diverse and spans different types of identities and people. And most importantly, her spot is a place that has great healing energy. Every month, I leave her spot relaxed, rejuvenated and filled with joy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know there are women who work in barbershops, and butch lesbians and straight women alike who get their hair cut in barbershops, but my personal politic is that I don\u2019t belong in black barbershops. There are so few places where black men are able to be vulnerable with one another that it just doesn\u2019t feel right for me to be there.\n\nBut I\u2019ve also had plenty of moments where I felt out of place in black beauty shops. I\u2019ve often felt like I was eavesdropping on black women\u2019s vulnerability in a space where femme black women have felt their safest to talk about their partners, their children, their relationships with their mothers and other women in their lives, and maybe\u2014at their most raucous\u2014whether they should be the first one to text their new love back after a night of getting their backs blown out.\n\nMy place in black beauty shops has often been fraught with deciding what part of my identity must take precedence over the other. At this point in my life, I feel lucky I no longer have to worry about that, but that\u2019s not the case for every butch woman. Understanding our place within black and primarily femme women\u2019s spaces can be complicated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I love the scents of black beauty salons and the energy of black women. We are divine, complex individuals\u2014even in our most hood and ratchet moments\u2014and in those spaces, we find ways to make joy and community.\n\nThankfully, I\u2019ve found a space\u2014a space where my stylist literally and figuratively weaves magic\u2014where I don\u2019t have to decide which of my identities gets to show up. For Marla, I am Stephanie: black/biracial, butch, lesbian, a client she respects, and whose success she roots for.

Maxine Waters (D-Calif.); author and political commentator Marc Lamont Hill; Black Lives Matter co-founder and organizer Patrisse Kahn Cullors; and some of the most committed activists, policymakers and community leaders in the country, this is a sleeves-rolled-up strategizing and planning session that makes the stakes clear and DPA\u2019s position plain:\n\n\n\nWe, as a country, those of us invested in freedom and liberation, equity and justice, cannot and will not take one step back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is a declaration of determination, resistance and revolution. It is a statement of intent: Those who have toiled and triumphed, loved and lost so much during a generational white supremacist war on the most marginalized and institutionally vulnerable people in the United States, shall not be moved.\n\n\n\nNot by Donald Trump.\n\n\n\nNot by Jefferson Beauregard \u201cJeff\u201d Sessions III.\n\n\n\nNot by stigma or by shame.\n\nBlacks and Latinos are still being unfairly targeted and arrested on marijuana-related charges\u2014even though whites are more likely to sell drugs\u2014and many former felons are prohibited from participating in the cannabis industry, the nation\u2019s fastest-growing economy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere are a few more statistics that reveal whiteness at work for its own good:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe so-called gentler war on drugs has not been gentle for black and brown people in this nation, and it was never intended to be. Even if had been, anti-blackness is entrenched and intentional. Drugs are just the top layer, the proxy target. For this reason, we must be fiercely committed to dismantling systems of violence that relentlessly batter black, brown, and indigenous communities in the name of protecting them.\n\nBeloved author, activist and organizer asha bandele, who is also senior director of the Drug Policy Alliance, sat down with The Root to discuss DPA\u2019s Not One Step Back strategy session and the cumulative and pervasive scars deeply etched into black and brown communities by the perpetuators of the war on drugs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Root: The Drug Policy Alliance has consistently fought back against the violence, both structurally and physically, that has been inflicted on black and brown people across the country. So let\u2019s start with the very core of the so-called war on drugs. How did we get here?\n\n\n\nasha bandele: It\u2019s important to say not only what the drug war is but to place it into the right frame. The drug war, as it was initiated by then-President Richard Nixon in 1971, was the legal response to black resistance in the South during the Civil Rights Movement. At that moment, we were at the height of the moral mountain. Legal segregation had technically ended with the Fair Housing Act of 1968 and then Nixon put forward this set of policies that were supposed to be colorblind, right?\n\nBut they weren\u2019t. They were manufactured to go after black people; they manufactured the evidence about drugs and they manufactured the evidence about who the perpetrators were. Nobody wanted to see their kid high and endangering their lives, which is why so many black people bought into the idea of this drug war. Now, we know that white people use and sell drugs more than black people do. But black and brown people were the people who went to jail.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: Tell me about the significance of holding the Not One Step Back strategizing session in Atlanta.\n\nab: The South has borne the brunt of mass incarceration. DPA held a conference in Louisiana [the prison capital of the world] in 2007, and now we\u2019re coming back to the Deep South at a time when the U.S. attorney general is from Alabama. Black people are 32 percent of Georgia\u2019s population, but 76 percent of those incarcerated for marijuana offenses. We\u2019re not taking one step back.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: The stigma attached to drug use leaches onto systems of oppression. Both are damaging to black and brown communities. There is a robust activist community in the South. It is where many of our ancestors are buried, and ground zero of the liberation struggle. But we\u2019re also talking about the Bible Belt, where there\u2019s still respectability politics. Some people are still ashamed of family members, sometimes even of themselves, because of drug addiction.\n\n\n\nThe fight for black and brown people to have autonomy over our bodies takes place right beside the critical need to recognize and dismantle systems of oppression strengthened by our trauma, including economic violence, that can lead to self-medication.\n\nab: That\u2019s exactly right; so when we\u2019re talking about African Americans, we\u2019re talking about a group of people who have lived under the stigma of simply being born. Just being born here, we were told that we were inferior and lazy. Now, the vulgarity of the drug war, with all the brainwashing it\u2019s done, is that it\u2019s convinced us to hate our own family and hate our own people. As long as we\u2019re talking about drugs, we don\u2019t have to talk about poverty. We don\u2019t have to talk about trauma.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe are struggling to maintain dignity within a white supremacist framework, but that dignity is maintained at the expense of those who are the most vulnerable. What we know for sure is that the use of drugs is not the final arbiter of whether or not a life is undone. If that were the case, then during the Wall Street era in the \u201980s and \u201990s, what happened to all those white boys who were using cocaine?\n\nTR: And that\u2019s so real. Drug use for some is a choice; for some it\u2019s an addiction. But this country\u2019s addiction to pathologizing and criminalizing blackness is the biggest addiction of all. It seems to be much easier for those in power or angling for power to address the symptoms and not the illness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe vulgarity of the drug war, with all the brainwashing it\u2019s done, is that it\u2019s convinced us to hate our own family and hate our own people. As long as we\u2019re talking about drug abuse, we don\u2019t have to talk about poverty. We don\u2019t have to talk about trauma.\u201d\n\nab: Yes! People don\u2019t have access to healthy food; people still don\u2019t have clean water\u2014not just in Flint, Michigan, but across this country. That requires real structural change. Extreme poverty in the United States is defined as a family of four living on less than $13,000 a year. And in many ways, we actually still believe that this is a free country. We believe this even as so many of us suffer this way. We still believe it even as we watch people getting shot down by police officers who suffer no consequences.\n\nTR: This administration is following in the time-honored American tradition of ruthlessly dehumanizing black people. Has DPA had to change course in the wake of Trump\u2019s unexpected Electoral College win?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nab: Well, I think that, like most people, we thought that Hillary Clinton would win. We thought that we would continue working to end mass incarceration. Now, we find that we\u2019re going to have to defend and protect a lot of our victories. We don\u2019t want the Trump administration going into Colorado, or any of the other states where marijuana has been legalized, and start arresting people again. We don\u2019t want people being deported. All these issues are on the table with this administration, so we\u2019re going to have to play some defense.\n\nWhen they go low, we go hard. We don\u2019t give up ground. We\u2019re not taking one step back.\n\nTR: So many lives have been disrupted or ended. There has been so much pain and devastation. At the heart of this combat is the reality that black lives matter to us, holding fast to the vision that black lives must matter in policies and practices that shape this country going forward.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nab: That\u2019s exactly right. I buried my stepson. I don\u2019t want to watch another son, daughter, or child go in the ground for a ridiculous set of policies that we\u2019ve somehow accepted. We need to pull apart these dangerous myths about drugs and the drug war so that we can face them with courage and with character. We must determine who we need to be in this moment. We haven\u2019t tried treating everybody as human. It\u2019s time that we do.\n\nNot only is it time to declare that we\u2019re not taking one step back; this is a warning to those who continue to occupy our communities with hypermilitarized police forces weighed down with weapons and prejudice\u2014and backed by white supremacist policies and practices\u2014that it\u2019s in their best interest not to take one more step forward.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more about Not One Step Back here.", "keywords": ["country", "step", "dont", "white", "justice", "war", "brown", "talking", "talks", "drugs", "drug", "hard", "black", "goes", "incarceration", "policy", "mass"], "polarity": 0.09057836520434948, "subjectivity": 0.4553643294588175},

Leveraging their popular podcast into TV stardom, \u201cthe Bodega Boys\u201d riff on popular culture, politics and (mostly) white people. They\u2019ve become the popular destination for the coolest guests because their show is basically The Daily Show if Trevor Noah were a pair of weed-smoking, 40-ounce-drinking dudes from the Bronx, N.Y..\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Bodega Boys\u2019 beef with DJ Envy began when text messages surfaced of DJ Envy (who is married) chatting with someone who suggested butt play with the Power 105.1 FM host. As usual, Desus and Mero became the hood version of CNN, exposing the story:\n\nThe dispute continued when DJ Envy appeared on an episode of The Real with his wife, seemingly trying to contain the damage. The couple was very honest about the radio host\u2019s past indiscretions, making it appear that they had fixed all of their problems. Desus and Mero, who never shy away from controversy, made fun of the appearance by Envy and his wife because ... well, that\u2019s what they do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, on Thursday morning, Desus and Mero appeared on The Breakfast Club. Envy was in his feelings from the time the men walked in, and there was nothing wrong with that except the men didn\u2019t realize there was a beef.\n\n\n\nAfter introducing his guests as \u201cDickhead\u201d and \u201cPussy,\u201d which is mad passive-aggressive and totally light-skinned, Envy began to explain the impetus behind his beige rage. (Oh, did I mention that Envy was sporting a \u201cMy God vs. My Enemies\u201d hat, which was totally planned because isn\u2019t it just like a light-skinned man to wear passive-aggressive clothing to a fuss fight?)\n\n\u201cYou owe my wife an apology,\u201d Envy said to a baffled Desus and Mero. \u201cWhen you insinuated that she was there for the check.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen DJ Envy played the clip in which Desus and Mero totally insinuated that Envy\u2019s wife was sticking around for the check. Envy wasn\u2019t going full light-skinned for being mad about that. It was a low blow for the talk show guests to take shots at Envy\u2019s wife. Envy explained that wives and children were off-limits, and the guests agreed and apologized.\n\nWhere Envy drove his Jeep Grand Cherokee off the road (yes, Jeep Grand Cherokees are the preferred cars of light-skinned men; just ask any Kappa) was when he couldn\u2019t let it go. He literally stewed in his anger like a spoiled child unable to accept that he\u2019d actually gotten his way. Not sure if Envy came into work looking for a fight, but what he found was an apology, and that wasn\u2019t good enough.\n\nEnvy proceeded to hard-chew his gum (totally light-skinned and passive-aggressive), and make snide remarks before he went full Sinbad and walked off the show, undoing all of Matt Barnes\u2019 good work to dispel the myth that light-skinned men will walk off the air.\n\nAt that point, if Envy was still upset, he should\u2019ve reached across the table and taken a swing at Desus (because Mero is heavier; Dominican\u2014which means there is a 62 percent chance he had a razor under his tongue; and because I\u2019m not here for light-skinned-on-light-skinned crime).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know, because that is what rapper Casanova 2x would\u2019ve done. He is my spiritual guide whenever I\u2019m trying to sort out whether or not I\u2019m inside my light-skinned bag. I can\u2019t see Casanova 2x pushing the microphone away and storming out of the interview after receiving an apology, if for no other reason than he made this song and you can\u2019t get passive-aggressive after rhyming that you would punch someone\u2019s teeth out.\n\nMy sources tell me that Envy walked off the air and into his office, where he took a few swings at the air and then curled up on the floor in the fetal position and had a good cry, and it was well-earned. (And by \u201csources,\u201d I mean my imagination, which is definitely a source.)\n\nEnvy wasn\u2019t wrong for sticking up for his wife\u2019s honor. That\u2019s the commendable part of what he did. Hell, owning up to his cheating on national radio and national television is a real look at grown-man shit. But come on, bruh, Vin Diesel didn\u2019t threaten to beat up Dwayne \u201cthe Rock\u201d Johnson in real life for you to match your hat to your emotions.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is only one way that Envy can undo this: He\u2019s going to have fight Charlamagne tha God in a caged death match or admit on air that he went full light-skinned and then apologize to his guests.\n\nOr, maybe, to redeem his credentials and escape the official censure at the next meeting of #TeamLightSkinned, he can go on Desus and Mero\u2019s show as a guest and fight them both.\n\nWatch out for the razor, though.", "keywords": ["men", "dj", "envy", "wife", "real", "history", "passiveaggressive", "walkoff", "desus", "radio", "envys", "mero", "moment", "tantrum", "lightskinned", "totally"], "polarity": 0.09482704402515722, "subjectivity": 0.5569444444444446},

Polanco\u2019s Afro-Latina beauty plays loud and proud, as she\u2019s now partnered with legacy brand Dove on the company\u2019s self-esteem-education workshops.\n\nAccording to the company\u2019s website, since founding the initiative in 2004, Dove has become the largest provider of self-esteem education in the world, reaching more young people than any nongovernmental organization, educational institution or government at 20 million and counting. The Glow Up had the pleasure of talking with boundary-breaking actress Polanco at Dove\u2019s latest workshop for teens.\n\nThe Glow Up: You\u2019ve always been outspoken about beauty inequality. Why did you partner with Dove?\n\nDascha Polanco: I\u2019m being very honest with you: I remember when Dove first came out with that billboard\u2014all the women wearing full briefs. I\u2019m a full-brief kind of girl, you know what I mean? When I saw Dove embrace real women and real bodies, I was like, \u201cThat\u2019s where brands need to be headed.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I learned that they\u2019ve partnered with Shonda Rhimes on self-esteem-education workshops and that they\u2019ve helped over 20 million young girls to have a positive relationship with themselves and self-esteem and body confidence, it was something that I wanted to be part of.\n\nTGU: What\u2019s the goal?\n\nDP: Allowing this new generation to enter positions of power with open minds. We are teaching them to be willing to look beyond what we\u2019ve been conditioned to think is right or what\u2019s beautiful.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: Can you share ways that you lift your own self-esteem?\n\nDP: It\u2019s very important to have gender equality in my household [so] that things are done across the board\u2014not because you\u2019re a boy, not because you\u2019re a girl\u2014but because you\u2019re both equally valuable. You both have the capacity, the ability, to go far farther than me, beyond me\u2014your opportunities are limitless. Whenever I feel like I have a positive impact, I can bring my daughter to the Dove self-esteem workshops and she can learn from these resources.\n\nPhoto: Dove/Unilever Brands\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: Do people have to go in person to the workshop?\n\nDP: Dove has the resources on the website. They also have parenting courses about how self-esteem starts in the home. When you look at studies of bullying in school, depression and suicidal behaviors have gone up because of not paying attention to the real issues affecting the youth. It\u2019s because we don\u2019t really have the time to have these conversations with our young ones.\n\nHaving that hour that you spend with them, if we start now, becomes a good cycle that will last a lifetime and regenerate itself. It will evolve into something so crucial. Especially in the times that we\u2019re living now, for our voices to be heard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: What action items can you leave the readers with?\n\nDP: Practice positive affirmations with your kids. Stand in front of the mirror and say \u201cI am powerful,\u201d \u201cI am beautiful,\u201d \u201cI am smart,\u201d \u201cI can do anything.\u201d Make mood boards. I tell my kids: \u201cWrite a list of everything you want to do. What do you want to be when you grow up? How do you see yourself in the next couple years? What are a couple of goals within the next month to get you there?\u201d\n\nAnd I do that with my daughter. I\u2019m in [a] constant battle with my daughter Dasany, who doesn\u2019t leave the house without her eyebrows painted on. She has eyebrows, but they\u2019re light eyebrows and I\u2019m like, \u201cGirl!\u201d I try to emphasize that with her beautiful skin right now, she doesn\u2019t need anything. I do whatever I can to make a positive impact, like bringing my daughter to this workshop with me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s all about words and what they hear; words penetrate your children so much. Sometimes, to compensate for the time that we don\u2019t get to spend with them, we\u2019re like, \u201cLet\u2019s go shopping,\u201d or some other materialistic thing. [But] you\u2019ll be surprised how much spending an hour talking with your kids changes them.\n\nPhoto: Dove/Unilever Brands\n\nTGU: And the conversation we have with ourselves?\n\nDP: We are focused ourselves on what is negative without truly having taken the moment to acknowledge our own external differences\u2014wanting to be approved of, wanting to be accepted. It has to start from within.

Sadly, one of the few true beacons of hope to push back against the oppressive regime that is the Trump administration is a 79-year-old trailblazer and pioneer, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), affectionately known as \u201cAuntie Maxine.\u201d\n\n\n\nFrom day one, Auntie Maxine has been adamant that she had no interest in working with an administration that wades deep in the waters of bigotry, racism and xenophobia.\n\n\u201cMy feet are firmly planted on the ground and dealing with the reality of things and what\u2019s happening and what\u2019s going on,\u201d she told The Root shortly after the president took office. \u201cIt has not been difficult; I just know that we are now going to have a new president. I don\u2019t care for him, I don\u2019t trust him and I know what I\u2019ve got to do.\u201d\n\nAuntie Maxine has been true to her word, whether it\u2019s been on the House Financial Services Committee, where she challenged Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to actually answer her questions\u2014it was this moment that spawned the heartfelt viral Auntie Maxine \u201creclaiming my time\u201d meme\u2014or speaking out against the atrocities of this administration whenever a microphone is in front of her. She has been adamant about Trump\u2019s impeachment and has constantly referred to the president as a con man.\n\n\u201cEverybody knows who this bully is,\u201d Waters told MSNBC\u2019s Chris Hayes on Monday, the Daily Beast reports. \u201cThis is a dishonorable human. He is a con man. He came to this job as a con man. I call him \u2018Don the Con Man.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe added: \u201cAll I know is this: If he thinks he can stop me from talking about \u2018Impeach 45,\u2019 he\u2019s got another thought coming. I am not intimidated by him. I\u2019m going to keep saying that we need to impeach him.\u201d\n\nSo Donald Trump\u2019s latest racist dog whistle to challenge Auntie Maxine\u2019s IQ falls on deaf ears because she was hip to who this president was long before he took office.\n\nIt\u2019s sad when America\u2019s aunt is probably America\u2019s toughest person and our biggest ally in the fight against blatant bigotry and racism. The president is currently running around the White House buck naked, and not one Democrat is willing to say he\u2019s not wearing any clothes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough it\u2019s heartwarming to see Waters so strong and willing to stand in her convictions against a divisive president who runs his administration like a schoolyard bully with unlimited Wi-Fi, it also saddens me that there aren\u2019t more Democrats willing to stand beside Auntie Maxine and call for Trump\u2019s ouster.\n\nAs it stands, those on the \u201cImpeach 45\u201d bandwagon are outliers for a more Rodney King, \u201cLet\u2019s all just get along\u201d Democratic vision, which is the equivalent of thinking that the schoolyard bully will understand anything but violence. At some point we\u2019ve got to move beyond reasoning.

Because we can always do what we want to do, or what we feel comfortable doing\u2014whether it\u2019s a weave or it\u2019s a perm or anything else. But it\u2019s when we don\u2019t feel like we have an option that it becomes a problem; when it then becomes a societal issue, rather than a personal decision. But there\u2019s a cult mentality that\u2019s crept into the movement that I\u2019m not really supportive of. I think it has a lot to do with something that happens when people convert to a lot of things. It\u2019s always the recent converts\u2014whether it be religious dogma or philosophy or anything else\u2014that tend to be really extreme. I live in a little less of an extreme world, in my personal life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndeed, even her decision to crop her famous locks was initially met with more opposition than support. But after years of joking about taking the leap, DaCosta ultimately took the decision in stride: \u201cI was walking down the street, and as crazy as this may sound, I heard a voice\u2014maybe it was my own inner voice or higher self\u2014just say, \u2018Cut your hair.\u2019\u201d\n\nAfter considering it late into the night, she lit some candles, sat down in front of her computer and recorded a conversation with herself, contemplating all of the things she would be releasing by cutting her hair:\n\nAnd when I tell you, after childbirth, that was the most powerful experience of my life. I cried, I hugged and kissed myself; it was amazing. And I never looked back. I always thought when people do that, the next day they wake up, like, \u201cOh my God, what did I do? I ruined my life.\u201d I didn\u2019t. I felt good about it. ... There\u2019s so much that has happened since [then] that I know would not have been possible had I been weighed down by the weight that I was carrying; the toxic relationships, other people\u2019s expectations of me, safety, hiding, not feeling beautiful without it. ... One of the things that I cut off as well was fear, and in doing so, realized how guided I was, not by love or confidence, but fear.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConfidence is an issue DaCosta confesses to having struggled with in younger years. She recalls an experience early on in her professional acting career, when her father presented her with a unique challenge:\n\nHe goes, \u201cI just have one question: \u2018Where does your confidence come from?\u2019 Don\u2019t answer now\u2014just think about it\u201d ... I think that that was\u2014it was an invitation to step into the answer, to figure out what it was. And it\u2019s something that I guess is from life, when you\u2019re ready to come into yourself. And it can\u2019t be forced and it can\u2019t be faked. And you know, it\u2019s amazing having all these mirrors around me now, and people, and relationships, and just seeing how the types of people coming into my life now are different. And I\u2019m so inspired by them, and they\u2019re a reflection of the work that I\u2019ve been doing to answer that question.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd while DaCosta has every intention of growing her hair back\u2014healthier and with new energy and genuine confidence\u2014taking the risk has come back to reward her tenfold, especially as she becomes more aware of the impact her image has had on others:", "keywords": ["know", "natural", "growing", "hair", "yaya", "chop", "dacosta", "teamnatural", "talks", "premiere", "images", "big", "2015", "meds", "chicago", "growth", "life", "2016"], "polarity": 0.1759024490002751, "subjectivity": 0.5000853454114325},

Luckily for me, there's rarely a day that passes without a hot-button issue being debated on one of my many social media timelines.\n\nOver the last couple of weeks, I've spent a great deal of time, perhaps more than usual, \"exchanging ideas\" about issues surrounding Gabrielle Douglas, Nate Parker, Chris Brown, Colin Kaepernick and more. I've noticed some repetitive counterarguments that often derail otherwise substantive conversations. I mean, that is the point, isn't it?\n\nI rounded up a few of the most frequent (and illogical) ways uncomfortable (or sadistic) commenters ruin productive discussions:\n\n\n\n1. \"Why now?\"\n\nThis is the go-to line for Bill Cosby apologists and Parker defenders. They want to know why Cosby's accusers came forward after decades of silence. Or why Parker's rape trial is being discussed now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd I just want to know, \"Why not now?\" You can't be charged with certain alleged crimes after a certain amount of time, but we can't discuss them, either, even when the story is currently in the news cycle? Even when a celebrity sits for interviews about his misdeeds? Should we all consult our calendars for an undefined expiration date before caring or commenting?\n\nIf an alleged victim doesn't speak up immediately, then she should take it to her grave? Is that how this works? If a heinous crime is alleged to have taken place and there's been no past accountability, is time a get-out-of-anyone-having-an-opinion free card?\n\nSomeone let me know. I'm confused.\n\n\n\n2. \"But white people allow it/don't do \u2026 \"\n\nWhite people are not the gold standard. I repeat: White people are not the gold standard. That there are moviegoers who turn a blind eye to Woody Allen or Roman Polanski, or who separate the man from his work of art, isn't a valid reason for black people to look past the shenanigans or crimes allegedly or actually committed by another black person. We ain't gotta \"follow the leader.\" We can think independently and hold black folk accountable when necessary.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. \"Don't judge/Only God can judge.\"\n\nOut of all the responses, this one irritates me the most. To judge, by Merriam-Webster's definition, is to form an opinion or draw a conclusion. We all judge. All of us. All the time. And that includes the \"Don't judge\" people. They just can't articulate a proper argument to defend their point of view, or they're guilty of similar behavior. Instead of admitting that, they get on the moral high horse and try to shame into silence folks who are using their brains. It's sooooo annoying, but rarely works.\n\n\n\n4. \"There are more important topics, like \u2026 \"\n\nIn fairness, discussing the fit or pattern of Cam Newton's pants doesn't compare, in terms of importance, to, say, poverty, racism or rape. But if you see that's the topic of discussion and you think it's wack, why didn't you keep scrolling?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd yes, folks can discuss Cam's pants one minute and #BlackLivesMatter the next. It's not as if folks get one opinion a day and they've wasted it frivolously on fashion.\n\nThis argument is even worse when folks actually are discussing an important topic such as racism or sexism or rape, and someone jumps in to say they should be talking about something else. Without fail, when folks are discussing police brutality, there's always someone who wants the whole discussion to cease and switch to \u201cblack-on-black\u201d crime. Women discussing sexism or rape? There's always that one person who jumps in wanting to talk about black folk uniting to fight the Man instead.\n\nYou passionately feel what you want to talk about needs a voice? Start your own #hashtag or thread so you can be heard.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. \"Y\u2019all just hating.\"\n\nNow, sometimes this one is appropriate, such as when you stumble upon a thread discussing the state of Gabrielle Douglas' hair while she is competing. Other times, this is thrown out because the commenter has a lack of anything intelligent to add to the conversation and a desire to invalidate all naysayers. To quote the great street prophet Common, \"If I don't like it, I don't like it/Doesn't mean that I'm hating.\" If you like something and the person or group you're engaging with doesn't, just state your support and your reasons for enjoying. Or even better, keep scrolling.\n\n\n\n6. \"It's a conspiracy \u2026 \"\n\nThis one drives me nuts, too, but it actually holds some weight right now. That girl who said Chris Brown pulled a gun on her and she had to run for her life, I mean, after she got her phone back? She wasn't in collusion with the feds to take down Brown, but that situation sounds more and more like a setup. Y\u2019all won this round.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I still want to say this: Your favorite celeb who suddenly has been humbled and dragged probably isn't the victim of a conspiracy. It's more likely that a series of bad decisions finally caught up with him or her, and it's harder to bury a story in the age of social media and blogs.\n\n\n\n7. \"It's the woman's fault \u2026 \"\n\nSadly, I've come to expect this from men and women alike when it comes to any form of abuse happening to a woman. But the frequency of this argument and how some folk will apply it to just any situation just baffles me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was part of a conversation recently about the \"media's emasculation of black men\" as inspired by Yung Joc's permed hair and Young Thug's album cover. I don't get the rationale, but I read through the comments to understand the perspective. I stopped when I got to a guy blaming man-perms and men in dresses on women. Apparently, women like and encourage these expressions, and men want to attract women, so if women didn't encourage it, men wouldn't do this.\n\nHuh? Young Thug wants to dress up like Scarlett O'Hara and that's my fault? Naw. That grown man decided to wear that dress. And if he's happy in it, I'm happy for him. But wearing that dress is solely on him.\n\nI find often that it's the most \"I am man, hear me roar, let me lead\"-type guys that refuse to hold other men accountable for anything. It's always, \"A woman made him do it.\" And I always wonder if they realize how weak it makes men sound. Like, if everything you do is because of a woman, you're a follower. Just get out the way, stop yelling about submission, and just let the folks who are already leading go on and do what they do without all the complaining.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBonus: \"You're a Negro bed wench.\"\n\nThis one is reserved for black women who dare to call themselves feminists and/or use words like \"privilege\" and \"misogynoir\" and/or don't rush to defend black men who have found themselves in a media scandal. if you believed the 60 women who accused Cosby of nefarious sexual conduct, thought Nate Parker was anything less than completely innocent or have expressed an unwillingness to attend an R. Kelly concert, you may have found this comment in your social media mentions.\n\nThis is a clear sign of a person who hates black women. There is no reasoning with the speaker, usually a man. Just block and report him for harassment. You're probably not the first person to whom he's said it. Maybe with enough complaints, the social media platform will ban his account and you'll be the last.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDemetria Lucas D\u2019Oyley is a contributing editor at The Root, a life coach and the author of Don\u2019t Waste Your Pretty: The Go-to Guide for Making Smarter Decisions in Life & Love as well as A Belle in Brooklyn: The Go-to Girl for Advice on Living Your Best Single Life.

I did not sign up to be no political activist.\u201d It\u2019s a sentiment as clear as the color of the sky in Los Angeles on a relatively smogless day.\n\nThe same goes for the rest of the quote: \u201cI wanna talk about my motherf\u2014kin' lean, my best friend dying, the girls that come in and out of my life, the jiggy fashion that I wear, my new inspirations in drugs! I don't wanna talk about no f\u2014king Ferguson and s\u2014t because I don't live over there! I live in f\u2014king Soho and Beverly Hills. I can't relate. I'm in the studio; I'm in these fashion studios; I'm in these bitches' drawers. I'm not doing anything outside of that. That's my life.\u201d\n\nSome of us knew of his 2015 TimeOut interview when it was first published. Despite Rocky\u2019s claim in an interview Wednesday with Power 105.1\u2019s The Breakfast Club, reading the TimeOut interview in full will do little to alleviate any frustrations with his thought process. And before that radio interview, the Harlem rapper, who now lives in \u201cf\u2014king Soho and Beverly Hills,\u201d said something equally clueless while speaking before the Debate Society of Oxford University. During that conversation, Rocky said, \u201cWhy are we exploiting the beef between the urban community and the police force when 60 people got shot on a Friday and Saturday [on a July 2014 holiday weekend] in Chicago in black-on-black crime?\u201d\n\nA$AP Rocky\u2019s issue is not that he was misquoted or that his remarks were received differently than intended; it\u2019s that his words have come back to haunt him several months later. They haunt him because as state-sanctioned violence against black people in this country continues to happen, those who enjoy a platform but do not advocate on behalf of black people are widely viewed as part of the problem. In his more recent radio interview, Rocky did not so much offer clarity about previous comments made as he tried to parse his words.\n\nIn his initial response to the social media pile-on, he took to Twitter to take shots at those finding the TimeOut interview late, though he did now acknowledge \u201call this social injustice makes me f\u2014king sick, tho I\u2019m still no politician.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn The Breakfast Club, he said, \"I feel terrible as a black man, as an American. It's crazy. This Donald Trump s\u2014t \u2026 I just don't understand how they keep saying a dark-skinned n\u2014ga don't like black people.\"\n\nStill, he asked, \u201cHow come black lives only matter when a police officer takes it? It should matter when a black life take it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat said, there was one somewhat better explanation about why he does not speak on police brutality:\n\n\n\nYour favorite rappers today\u2014I don't know if it's [Young] Thug, Future, Drake, anybody\u2014you don't always hear their content being about the political s\u2014t going on or all the other s\u2014t. I feel like, why put me on a pedestal for that, especially when I'm not asking for that? I want to make music, I want to inspire, I want to promote peace because at a time like this, I don't have all the answers. I'm not trying to run for Congress or office. I don't have all the answers. I want to promote prosperity especially for black people, especially for just young people, ambitious people, underprivileged. I'm not here to talk about supremacy, who's dominant. It's f\u2014ked up.\n\nAn inconvenient truth is that, as helpful as it is for each of us\u2014especially those with huge platforms\u2014to advocate on behalf of black people in the wake of what\u2019s happening to so many of us, it is still by and large a choice. Moreover, it is a choice that some may elect to do but are unfortunately not equipped to handle. A$AP Rocky can talk about many things with precision: fashion, his flawless skin, the women he screws, the friends he\u2019s lost along the way and whatever else involves his private life. Unfortunately, as he\u2019s made it painfully clear over and over again, social unrest, police brutality and racism are not his forte.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe people who conflate \u201cblack-on-black crime\u201d with state-sanctioned violence are of the Stacey Dash school of thinking. It is a pool as deep as a wad of spit on a New York City sidewalk on a hot day in July. There are many other celebrities\u2014namely those minority ones who mistakenly invoke \u201cAll Lives Matter\u201d\u2014just like Rocky. They don\u2019t know any better, and while we hope they get better, in the meantime, it\u2019s probably better off for all parties involved if they shut up.\n\nMaybe we shouldn\u2019t put certain celebrities on pedestals and expect more than what they can give intellectually. Even so, if you go out of your way not only to misrepresent the movement but also to lend your black face to a white-contrarian narrative seeking to discount the racism happening in this country, as A$AP Rocky did, then you deserve whatever comes your way.\n\nAct accordingly.\n\nMichael Arceneaux hails from Houston, lives in Harlem and praises Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s name wherever he goes.

Leveraging their popular podcast into TV stardom, \u201cthe Bodega Boys\u201d riff on popular culture, politics and (mostly) white people. They\u2019ve become the popular destination for the coolest guests because their show is basically The Daily Show if Trevor Noah were a pair of weed-smoking, 40-ounce-drinking dudes from the Bronx, N.Y..\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Bodega Boys\u2019 beef with DJ Envy began when text messages surfaced of DJ Envy (who is married) chatting with someone who suggested butt play with the Power 105.1 FM host. As usual, Desus and Mero became the hood version of CNN, exposing the story:\n\nThe dispute continued when DJ Envy appeared on an episode of The Real with his wife, seemingly trying to contain the damage. The couple was very honest about the radio host\u2019s past indiscretions, making it appear that they had fixed all of their problems. Desus and Mero, who never shy away from controversy, made fun of the appearance by Envy and his wife because ... well, that\u2019s what they do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, on Thursday morning, Desus and Mero appeared on The Breakfast Club. Envy was in his feelings from the time the men walked in, and there was nothing wrong with that except the men didn\u2019t realize there was a beef.\n\n\n\nAfter introducing his guests as \u201cDickhead\u201d and \u201cPussy,\u201d which is mad passive-aggressive and totally light-skinned, Envy began to explain the impetus behind his beige rage. (Oh, did I mention that Envy was sporting a \u201cMy God vs. My Enemies\u201d hat, which was totally planned because isn\u2019t it just like a light-skinned man to wear passive-aggressive clothing to a fuss fight?)\n\n\u201cYou owe my wife an apology,\u201d Envy said to a baffled Desus and Mero. \u201cWhen you insinuated that she was there for the check.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen DJ Envy played the clip in which Desus and Mero totally insinuated that Envy\u2019s wife was sticking around for the check. Envy wasn\u2019t going full light-skinned for being mad about that. It was a low blow for the talk show guests to take shots at Envy\u2019s wife. Envy explained that wives and children were off-limits, and the guests agreed and apologized.\n\nWhere Envy drove his Jeep Grand Cherokee off the road (yes, Jeep Grand Cherokees are the preferred cars of light-skinned men; just ask any Kappa) was when he couldn\u2019t let it go. He literally stewed in his anger like a spoiled child unable to accept that he\u2019d actually gotten his way. Not sure if Envy came into work looking for a fight, but what he found was an apology, and that wasn\u2019t good enough.\n\nEnvy proceeded to hard-chew his gum (totally light-skinned and passive-aggressive), and make snide remarks before he went full Sinbad and walked off the show, undoing all of Matt Barnes\u2019 good work to dispel the myth that light-skinned men will walk off the air.\n\nAt that point, if Envy was still upset, he should\u2019ve reached across the table and taken a swing at Desus (because Mero is heavier; Dominican\u2014which means there is a 62 percent chance he had a razor under his tongue; and because I\u2019m not here for light-skinned-on-light-skinned crime).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know, because that is what rapper Casanova 2x would\u2019ve done. He is my spiritual guide whenever I\u2019m trying to sort out whether or not I\u2019m inside my light-skinned bag. I can\u2019t see Casanova 2x pushing the microphone away and storming out of the interview after receiving an apology, if for no other reason than he made this song and you can\u2019t get passive-aggressive after rhyming that you would punch someone\u2019s teeth out.\n\nMy sources tell me that Envy walked off the air and into his office, where he took a few swings at the air and then curled up on the floor in the fetal position and had a good cry, and it was well-earned. (And by \u201csources,\u201d I mean my imagination, which is definitely a source.)\n\nEnvy wasn\u2019t wrong for sticking up for his wife\u2019s honor. That\u2019s the commendable part of what he did. Hell, owning up to his cheating on national radio and national television is a real look at grown-man shit.

Adding the cost of shipping, it\u2019s a little pricey, but it\u2019s absolutely top quality and very, very pretty.\n\n(Craft glitter can wreak havoc on your body, so beware: Cosmetic-grade glitter is essential when trying to achieve any metallic-inspired look because it will not scratch your cornea and is acid-free.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo apply the perfect Joy Lorraine glitter lip, first apply liquid lipstick and blot. Then, with a brush, apply one drop of the adhesive to your lips. Dip the same brush in the glitter and apply to your lips.\n\nMy personal endorsement? The glitter does not come off when you eat or drink, and it feels supple on the lips. Do not, however, rub your lips together; it breaks the surface tension of the bond between glitter and glue. But trust me: I had eight hours of fun with my pumpkin-glitter lips.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy advice? Go for the gold. Put on your bamboo earrings or Sade hoops, clap on your metallic reflective shades and let the world bask in your glittering makeup glory. When you\u2019re ready to take it all off, oil-based remover is essential\u2014Vaseline will do the trick.\n\nBut Joy Lorraine glitter doesn\u2019t have to stop at the lips. If you want to shine deep into the night and you\u2019re thinking some wild, wild thoughts, take a big, synthetic makeup brush and dust your body down from head to toe.\n\nA little glitter goes a long way, baby.", "keywords": ["deux", "glory", "sparkle", "lips", "glittering", "makeup", "apply", "beautys", "youre", "glitter", "lorraine", "little", "glow", "shine", "joy", "brush"], "polarity": 0.2179350321395776, "subjectivity": 0.36850920544102367},

But a new study finds that the opioid epidemic, which has affected mostly white Americans, is just one part of the growing U.S. drug crisis. The report reveals that deaths from cocaine overdoses among black people were roughly on par with heroin and prescription-opioid-caused deaths among white people.\n\nThe study was published Monday in the medical journal Annals of Internal Medicine and reported by CNN.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmong the study\u2019s key findings was that cocaine-overdose deaths were almost as common among black men as prescription-opioid deaths were among white men between 2012 and 2015. Meredith Shiels, co-author of the study, also told CNN that researchers found cocaine-overdose deaths to be \u201cslightly more common in black women than deaths from heroin overdose in white women.\u201d\n\n\u201cNumerous U.S. national surveillance studies and media reports have highlighted an alarming rise in drug-poisoning deaths in recent years,\u201d Shiels, who is also an investigator at the National Cancer Institute, said.\n\nBut, she noted, most studies have focused on opioid-related deaths, and she emphasized that death rates have increased most dramatically among white communities. The increasing rates in drug-overdose deaths among black and Latinx Americans, however, \u201chave received less attention,\u201d Shiels told CNN.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe new study finds an increase in overdose deaths across all ages in white and Latinx groups, but, according to CNN, \u201crising rates were most pronounced among older black men (50 or older) and older black women (45 or older).\u201d\n\nThis difference manifests itself in the study\u2019s analysis of peak ages for overdose deaths. White people between the ages of 30 and 34 had the highest rates for fatal drug overdoses. In contrast, black people between ages 50 and 59 logged the highest rates for overdose deaths.\n\nWhile the reasons for the increase in cocaine use and deaths aren\u2019t clear, the new data points to a wider drug abuse crisis gripping the U.S.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot mentioned in the CNN report are reports of cocaine being cut with fentanyl, a synthetic opioid; the combination has proved deadly.\n\nOne report from the Cincinnati Enquirer says that the cocaine-fentanyl combination has appeared in only a few regions, listing Ohio, New York City, San Francisco and Canada. But at least one medical examiner\u2014Cuyahoga County, Ohio\u2019s Dr. Thomas Gilson\u2014said that he believes drug dealers are mixing cocaine with fentanyl to increase opioid addiction within the black community. Gilson testified before a U.S. Senate subcommittee in May, detailing his findings.\n\n\u201cCocaine had been the only drug that victims were predominately African American,\u201d Gilson told the subcommittee. \u201cThe covert introduction of fentanyl into the cocaine supply has caused a rapid rise in fatalities, and in 2017, the rate of African-American fentanyl-related deaths has doubled from 2016.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nData from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that rates of overdose deaths have risen by 5.5 percent each year between 1999 and 2015. In total, 52,404 people died in the U.S. from drug overdoses in 2015 alone. But that number is likely low.\n\nPart of the challenge in doing these sorts of studies, CNN notes, is that national statistics on fatal overdoses are drawn from information on death certificates\u2014which can be inaccurate or incomplete. One recent study cited by CNN found that nearly 1 in 5 drug overdose deaths in 2014 did not identify which drug or drugs were used.\n\nRead more at CNN.", "keywords": ["whites", "overdose", "overdoses", "par", "white", "cocaine", "shows", "drug", "study", "opioidrelated", "rates", "number", "cnn", "black", "fatal", "deaths"], "polarity": 0.025674931129476584, "subjectivity": 0.36851239669421487},

Honey, this mask will snatch your face back to a time when your biggest problem was trying to get your parents to let you stay out until 11 p.m. Hanacure is an all-in-one, deep-cleaning, tightening and complexion-brightening mask\u2014each treatment takes 30 minutes, and you do it at home.\n\nHow can this mask address so many concerns at once? The science is called OctoLift. Hanacure contains peptides for renewing a tighter appearance of the skin, and botanicals for brightening the complexion. You mix together a gelling solution and lifting serum, and apply it with the brush included with the kit. Just make sure you don\u2019t get it on your lips or too close to your eyes\u2014though, while you\u2019re at it, do put it on your hands!

The mixture sucks your face in so hard, it feels like it\u2019s cementing to your skin as it draws carbon monoxide from the air to activate the ingredients.\n\nAnd the results? Whoa! While it\u2019s just OK on hyperpigmentation, it\u2019s absolutely fabulous for correcting ashy skin, little blemishes and fine lines. You don\u2019t have to take my word for it\u2014check out what other people say on Hanacure\u2019s Instagram.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s so good that I suggest you skip the foundation and use the mask to get your glow on for that New Year\u2019s Eve party. The mask comes in a single treatment for $29, or there\u2019s a full treatment set of four masks that you\u2019re supposed to apply every other day, for $110.

On Tuesday, Donald Trump not only fired the secretary of state\u2014and stand-in for every daytime soap opera\u2019s mean oil baron\u2014Rex Tillerson, but he also got rid of some guy named John McEntee, who was his personal assistant.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, McEntee was let go because of issues surrounding his security clearance. McEntee could be heard screaming, \u201cThis is bullshit! Jared Kushner\u2019s ass couldn\u2019t get clearance to ride on a Greyhound bus, but I\u2019m fired?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFine, McEntee wasn\u2019t heard screaming, but his ass was reportedly escorted out of the White House\u2014according to one official, he didn\u2019t even have a chance to take any of his belongings, not even his jacket\u2014because escorting people out of places where they have been fired is mad degrading and I\u2019m here for it. I want to have security at my next house party just so I can randomly walk through and ask that someone who doesn\u2019t use a coaster be escorted out and then look at them like an evil slave owner as they feebly attempt to explain with their eyes that it was all a mistake.\n\nDoes any of us know who McEntee is? Of course not. Does it matter that he\u2019s been fired? Well, kind of. The Trump administration has been a mess since infancy. Clearly the president is in over his head in policy he doesn\u2019t understand, and anyone who tries to tell him different is getting the big boot.

Men who don\u2019t put the messenger-bag strap across their body can\u2019t be trusted, and McEntee\u2019s ill-advised handling of his messenger bag proves that he didn\u2019t deserve to be in the Beverly Hillbillies White House.\n\nA White House official told WSJ, \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be great for morale.\u201d\n\nWelp, that\u2019s it, folks, nothing more to see here. McEntee was at the White House and now he isn\u2019t, and while none of us knew who he was, he will be missed. I guess. Also, something tells me that Trump isn\u2019t done letting people go. He\u2019s like the uncle who once threw three touchdowns in a junior varsity nonconference game and can\u2019t stop talking about it at every Thanksgiving even though he\u2019s 74 years old and was in high school in the 1950s.

And we can\u2019t blame her; Jackson is indisputably an icon. You know it, and we know it.\n\nMs. Blaine, a West Hollywood resident hailing from Hawaii, got her big break when her childhood friend, legendary choreographer and longtime Jackson collaborator Gil Duldulao, called her to groom Jackson\u2019s background dancers. Blaine\u2019s talent and generally laid-back demeanor\u2014which belies her fiery passion for hair\u2014quickly secured her a place on the team.\n\nToday, Blaine works directly with key hairdresser Janet Zeiton on Jackson\u2019s videos, ad campaigns and tours. The Glow Up landed an interview with Blaine just as she touched down from the superstar\u2019s latest U.S. State of the World Tour to find out about the methods behind how Janet stays in control\u2014of her hair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up: Let\u2019s get right to it: Every woman wants Janet Jackson icon-status hair that looks effortless and lasts when they hit the dance floor.\n\nCassidy Blaine: OK, I got you. Janet has a lot of hair and a beautiful tight curl that\u2019s past her shoulders when you straighten it. There\u2019d be no way she could have kept her hair if\u2014like a lot of these celebrities and entertainers\u2014she constantly put extensions and stuff in her hair. It takes over and wears out and tears up the hair. So she really tries to avoid that, and stays using her natural hair.\n\nTGU: What\u2019s the secret?\n\nCB: So, we made a ponytail for her. I used similar textures to her hair. I mixed pieces of hair; some a little bit more lengthy and not so curly, and some more tight.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: What\u2019s the system for attaching the ponytail?\n\nCB: Well, basically, the piece that I created for her, it\u2019s very easy-breezy, like putting on a scrunchy. It\u2019s a drawstring that encases the bun, and two tiny combs cinch in a little bit. And we just kind of cross-pin it. We only use open granny pins and avoid bobby pins.

It\u2019s a great product. I used their hydrating cream to style. I also use Sebastian Ultra-Firm Finishing Hairspray, because it doesn\u2019t flake up when we try to attach it to Janet\u2019s bun.\n\nTGU: How do you get her hair straight?\n\nCB: I blow it out! My blow-dryer\u2019s like a gun.

It was gorgeous. Google it, girl!\n\nTGU: How do dancers keep their hair looking good when they\u2019re performing?\n\nCB: Wigs! Because they don\u2019t have to use hair spray. I stress never to use too much product when you\u2019re trying to achieve a style, because they get filmy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: Tell me about what it\u2019s like to do hair on Janet\u2019s level?\n\nCB: I\u2019m living a prayer that I put into action, and my friends helped me get there.

And it is clear that the writers of WGN\u2019s Underground, the exceptional runaway hit show that tracks the movements on the Underground Railroad, have been, too.\n\n\n\nThere are spoilers here, so proceed at your own risk.\n\nOver the course of two seasons, viewers have been able to witness not just the larger struggle for freedom that enslaved black people fought\u2014and continue to fight\u2014but the more intimate struggle for identity, love and interpersonal relationships that took place behind the blood-soaked cotton walls of oppression.\n\nI have been riveted by Underground\u2019s treatment of sex and love. That black women and men still yearned for touch, for release, despite their chains is not something that is often discussed. Showing black bodies as erotic and beautiful and sensual while they\u2019re covered literally and figuratively with the scars of white supremacist violence is groundbreaking and necessary work. Read the article \u201cSearching for Climax: Black Erotic Lives in Slavery and Freedom,\u201d the brilliant work of Treva B. Lindsey and Jessica Marie Johnson, for more on this.\n\n\n\nWhile there is a clear trajectory from black bodies as erotic and vilified during slavery to black bodies being fetishized and criminalized now, it is the season 2 character arc of Ernestine, played by the incomparable Amirah Vann, that pushes \u201cthe underground\u201d squarely into the present as it collides with the war on drugs.\n\n\n\nErnestine has lost everything.\n\n\n\nHer son Sam has been hanged to pave the way for Tom Macon\u2019s political and racist ambitions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMacon, her rapist, master of the Macon Plantation in Georgia, is dead\u2014which is a loss of tenuous protection.\n\nJames, her son with Macon, has been forced out into the fields after enjoying the superficial privileges of being raised in \u201cthe Big House.\u201d\n\n\n\nRosalee, her daughter with Macon, ran away to freedom and is risking her life as an abolitionist under the tutelage of Harriet \u201cMoses\u201d Tubman.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd Ernestine, who played \u201cgood nigger\u201d for the sake of her children and herself, has been sold by Macon\u2019s viciously insecure and jealous wife to a South Carolina plantation. For the first time that we\u2019ve seen, Stine is in the field, thick scars on her back, suffering abuse from her new lover, Hicks, and fighting the urge to kill herself by breathing in\u2014and subsequently becoming addicted to\u2014laudanum, or \u201ctincture of opium.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis is the reality for many black women battling addiction and being criminalized for it today.\n\n\n\nIn a previous interview with The Root, Samuel K. Roberts Jr., Ph.D.\u2014director of the Columbia University Institute for Research in African-American Studies, associate professor of history at Columbia\u2019s School of Arts and Sciences, and associate professor of sociomedical sciences at Columbia\u2019s Mailman School of Public Health\u2014and I discussed this nuanced and painful reality in depth.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpecifically, Roberts is a pioneer in reframing the concept of harm reduction to encompass what harm reduction looks like for black people, and it focuses on much more than the ways in which society can make it safer for those addicted to drugs to seek help and rehabilitate. Harm reduction of color is focused on how critical it is to dismantle white supremacist systems of oppression that often lead black people\u2014black women specifically, in this context\u2014to self-medicate.\n\nRoberts said:\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s really so much in terms of drug policy and criminal-justice policy that affects black women in very specific ways. Black women\u2019s incarcerated population mushroomed in the early \u201990s, late \u201990s, and the first decade of the 2000s. Black women in particular are more vulnerable to the problems of fraying community bonds, such as domestic abuse, the state incursions and state violence, and so there\u2019s certain ways in which substance use with black women has its own particular dimensions, as clearly an indication of self-medication. And once they\u2019re in the system, they are particularly more vulnerable to the sexual assault and violence, either in encounters with police officers or with correctional officers. This is a critical issue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a previous interview with The Root, Susan Burton\u2014founder and executive director of A New Way of Life Reentry Project, a not-for-profit organization that currently helps 32 women re-enter society after incarceration equipped with the support system they need\u2014and I discussed the many ways that societal stigma around drug use and mental health, oppressive and violent conditions, and a criminal injustice system conspire to keep black women in a cycle of enslavement in which drugs often provide the only relief.\n\nBurton became addicted to crack cocaine in 1981 after a Los Angeles police officer ran over her 5-year-old son as he played outside their home and never looked back.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen my son died, the grief, the pain that I was in, you know, I needed something to help me cope with that,\u201d Burton said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen people in physical pain, and I\u2019ve seen people in dire mental distress. The level of grief I was in, I needed something to deal with that pain, that rage. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d have done to get through that. So I used drugs; I used until I found another solution.\n\n\u201cI was never offered help when I stood in front of the judge and told them what had happened in my life,\u201d she continued. \u201cThey hit the gavel and sent me to prison, had me stripped down and inspected like a slave. Handcuffed and sent me to work for 8 cents an hour.\u201d\n\n\n\nBurton continued:\n\n\n\nI remember in a movie I saw, it may have been Roots, and I remember the woman saying, \u201cMaster, master please don\u2019t sell my baby. Master, master please, I\u2019ll do anything, don\u2019t take my baby.\u201d And I watch black women go through the court system and they say, \u201cJudge, judge, please let me have my baby back, I\u2019ll do anything. Judge, judge please let me have my baby back.\u201d I watch that judge, regardless of what that woman tries to do in dire, dire circumstances, not give that woman back custody of her child. And it\u2019s heart-wrenching and it\u2019s heartbreaking. So, what do you do? Where do you run to? That woman is pretty much powerless to do anything but curl up in a ball or self-medicate, right? So, you know, I know what it feels like to lose a child. But sometimes, it\u2019s that that child gets put in the foster care system and, many times, they end up feeling abandoned, no love, and they self-medicate that pain, too. I see the breaking, the criminalization, the hurt and the pain through these systems that is just, oh, it\u2019s unconscionable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDo you see Ernestine?\n\nOnce Burton conquered her addiction, broke her chains, she dedicated her life to freeing other women from the same. Michelle Alexander, author of The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness, calls her Harriet Tubman.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe parallels between her story and Underground\u2019s second season, in which Harriet Tubman is played by Aisha Hinds, are clear.\n\n\n\nDuring this season, viewers watch black women fight against their chains, both visible and invisible. We watch Stine suffer through intimate partner violence, grieve the loss of her children and the loss of her identity.

That's the answer you're going to give? You're going to sit up here and pretend that Kyrie isn't your favorite player in the league, and that you haven't been writing about him since 2012?\n\nI didn't think that was relevant information today.\n\nWhatever, man. Anyway, who is Kehlani?\n\nKehlani is a young woman who, apparently, sings songs. I wish I had more to tell you about the names of her songs or perhaps the types of songs she sings, but I'd have to google it. Which means you'd find out just as quickly as I would.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOkay. Well, who is PartyNextDoor?\n\nPartyNextDoor could literally be performing right now at a party next door \u2014 with a note on my door letting me know PartyNextDoor will be at a party next door this morning \u2014 and I still wouldn't know who he was. I'd just be annoyed my neighbors were having a party at 11am.\n\nSo\u2026you get paid to follow and write about pop culture, right?\n\nI do.\n\nAnd you don't know who these people are?\n\nI don't. I'm not going to lie and say that I do. Have I heard the names \"Kehlani\" and \"PartyNextDoor\" before? Yes I have. Do I know why these are names I've heard before? No I don't.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOkay. Well, who is Chris Brown?\n\nChris Brown is light-skinned.\n\nWhy are we talking about them today?\n\nWell, my entry point into all of this came Monday afternoon, when I noticed Kyrie's name was the top trending topic. This immediately sent a chill through my spine, because if an athlete's name is trending while there are no games being played, it's usually because something bad happened to him. An arrest, perhaps. Or maybe a drug suspension. And, knowing what I know about Kyrie's extensive (and annoyingly random) injury history, my first fear was that he contracted knee AIDS or something.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKnee AIDS? Really?\n\nLook, this is a dude who broke his toe in college while making a cut, broke his hand the summer after his rookie season slapping a wall, and broke his kneecap last summer after bumping into a guy who's literally made out of water. Knee AIDS isn't really that far-fetched.\n\nAnyway, he was actually trending because Kehlani \u2014 who Kyrie was apparently dating \u2014 was apparently cheating on him. And the internet decided to have quite a bit of fun at Kyrie's expense.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWait\u2026how did the internet find out about Kehlani's alleged infidelity?\n\nPartyNextDoor \u2014 who happened to be Kehlani's ex \u2014 posted a photo on Instagram of them in bed together.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI see. Well, why do you keep using words like \"apparently\" and \"alleged?\" Everything seems pretty clear here. Kyrie was dating a woman (Kehlani) who cheated on him with her ex (PartyNextDoor). The ex provided photo evidence. There's not much ambiguity here.\n\nActually, there is. We have no idea whether Kyrie and Kehlani were still seeing each other. Although their relationship was public, it's very possible that they broke up privately. The only person definitely in the wrong here is PartyNextDoor.\n\nHow so?\n\nWhether Kehlani and Kyrie were actually still dating or not, people who knew of the relationship assumed they were. And sharing a photo like that is the pinnacle of passive-aggressive fuckboytivity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich, to be fair, shouldn't have been a big surprise.\n\nWhy not?\n\nBecause he's an OVO artist. And OVO is Drake's label. And Drake is the patron saint of passive-aggressive fuckboytivity. Ultimately, PartyNextDoor was just acting out what happens in literally every single Drake verse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat happened next?\n\nAyesha Curry's name started trending. Again.\n\nWait\u2026what? Why the hell did that happen?\n\nBecause whenever a young and famous Black man who is dating a woman experiences any type of relationship-related adversity, Ayesha Curry's name is dropped as an example of the \"type of female these thoterrific bitches need to be.\" As I tweeted Monday evening, she's the Hotep Twitter Candyman. Say her name in the mirror five times and ashy elbows will appear.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, what happened after that?\n\nThings got a quite a bit more serious early Tuesday as Kehlani shared a photo of her in a hospital room, with a caption suggesting she attempted to commit suicide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWow. That's really sad.\n\nIt is. And the sadness turned surreal when #StayStrongKehlani became the top trending topic just hours after she was getting shaded by every corner of the internet. Which is like wearing a RIP shirt to honor someone you just shot. There's a cognitive dissonance that seems to exist within internet shade culture. Yes, the memes can be funny and clever, but I think we forget sometimes that there are actual people at the receiving end of these jokes. Actual people who could be so upset by it that they're driven to the type of depression that makes them consider ending their own lives.\n\nSo, I noticed Chris Brown's name is in the title. How did he get involved with all of this?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarly Wednesday morning, Brown tweeted that he believed Kehlani's suicide attempt was an inauthentic ploy for attention.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy would Chris Brown even feel the need to chime in here?\n\nAsking why Chris Brown does what Chris Brown does is like asking my four-month-old daughter why she smiles at clocks. It's like he has a timer that goes off every six months to remind him to remind us he's a 26-year-old six-year-old. If Drake is the patron saint of passive-aggressive but relatively harmless fuckboytivity, Chris Brown is fuckboy emertus.\n\nI do know however that Chris Brown and Kyrie Irving are apparently good friends. And that, considering the history between Chris Brown and Drake, he's probably not too fond of Drake-related artists. So there's that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, I have to admit something. It seemed kind of fishy for Kehlani to share a photo of herself in the hospital after her suicide attempt. I know listening to Chris Brown is like listening to a genital wart, but I think he has a point here.\n\nWas Chris Brown the only person to be a bit skeptical about how genuine Kehlani's suicide attempt was? No, he wasn't. But we don't know what's going on in that young woman's head. None of us do. And when something as serious as suicide is on the table, we have to give her the benefit of the doubt. If there's even a 1% chance she's sincere, it needs to be treated like a 100% chance.\n\nSaying someone faked a suicide attempt and questioning their authenticity is ultimately an implicit way of daring them to try again. And someone as famous as Chris Brown doing it with the ginormous platform he has is dangerous, disgusting, and possibly even criminal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, \"seeking attention\" and \"being suicidal\" are qualities that can exist at the same time. The presence of one doesn't negate the presence of the other. Perhaps she did share that picture to elicit sympathy, but that doesn't mean she didn't legitimately want to kill herself.\n\nGenerally speaking, we don't know shit about mental health. And the conversations that tend to surround these types of topics are examples of that.\n\nSo what happens next?\n\nI have no idea. All I do know is that these are all exceedingly young people. Kyrie just turned 24. Kehlani is 20. PartyNextDoor is 22. Chris Brown is 26. And I do not envy the generation who has to go through their teens and 20s \u2014 and all the perfectly normal relationship-related fuckshit that occurs when you're a teenager and a young adult \u2014 with every move they make documented on social media.", "keywords": ["kehlani", "know", "going", "chris", "irving", "wtf", "partynextdoor", "brown", "suicide", "explained", "young", "trending", "kyrie", "apparently"], "polarity": 0.05739247311827955, "subjectivity": 0.4823284690220173},

And the buxom, gray-eyed, Afro-rocking, melanin-poppin\u2019 recording artist is making major waves online, mostly because of the criticism surrounding her dark skin and kinky hair.\n\nBefore you check your calendar, yes, I can confirm that it is indeed 2018 and we\u2019re still talking about skin tones and hair textures not fitting into society\u2019s limited beauty standards.\n\nAmara recently appeared on The Breakfast Club, and the first question one of the show\u2019s hosts, Charlamagne tha God, asked her was, \u201cWhat are you? Racewise?\u201d I should have known from there that the interview would take an ignorant turn.\n\n\n\nOnce she said that she was Dominican and called herself an Afro-Latina, The Breakfast Club co-host DJ Envy chimed in with, \u201cWhat is Afro-Latina? I thought it was half-black and something else, half-Latina.\u201d I couldn\u2019t handle DJ Envy\u2019s views of Amara\u2019s background when he said that he thought Dominicans didn\u2019t really mess with blacks or Puerto Ricans.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t want to be black and they didn\u2019t want to be Puerto Rican,\u201d DJ Envy so eloquently deduced. This guy. I\u2019m not even going to dig into that; I just wanted you to know that\u2019s something this man said ... out loud.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo which Charlamagne offered Amara, \u201cYou can say you\u2019re a Latina with an Afro.\u201d\n\nWell, gee, can I?!\n\n\n\nAmara appeared poised throughout the entire interview, during which she spoke about her (and society\u2019s) issues with colorism, some producer named Young Hollywood and why representation matters. Young Hollywood is a Love & Hip Hop: Miami castmate whose biggest claim to fame, as it stands, is his ignorant critique of Amara\u2019s image.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the show, Young Hollywood has urged Amara to consider making her look more Beyonc\u00e9 and less Macy Gray. We all know how much representation matters, and even though Love & Hip Hop: Miami may not be the most savory form of representation, you can\u2019t deny how smart the show\u2019s creator and producer, Mona Scott-Young, is for opening up this problematic dialogue to the show\u2019s demographic.\n\nColorism is a hot-button topic that many of us debate, but allowing this subject to take root in a (dare I say it) shallow pond of viewers who are mostly watching to see who splashes what in whose face is golden.\n\n\n\nI find it interesting that Amara is becoming the face of the colorism debate in the Latinx community, but I find it appalling that someone like Charlamagne tha God would ask her, \u201cYou sure it\u2019s not in your mind?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs. He. Serious?\n\n\n\nI respect Charlamagne, despite his problematic nature. The last time we spoke was in The Root\u2019s offices, where I asked him about his opinion about black women. The conversation was enlightening, to say the least, and it made me a believer in Charlamagne\u2019s mission of keeping black excellence on full display. But his thoughts on Amara\u2019s plight as a dark-skinned Dominican woman gave me pause.\n\nHe said, \u201cI\u2019ve never heard this conversation until just now.\u201d And when he went on to ask, \u201cWhat is the struggle that you\u2019re facing?\u201d I almost couldn\u2019t believe that this man who\u2019s had issues with the pigmentation of his own skin would ask this Afro-Latina woman what struggle she\u2019s facing, as if he has no idea what colorism is and how it affects people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo add insult to, well, insult, Charlamagne brought up Cardi B and her success as a measure of how far we\u2019ve come in accepting people who aren\u2019t cookie-cutter. Sure, but using Cardi B as an example in this conversation about colorism isn\u2019t valid because Cardi B isn\u2019t a dark-skinned Afro-Latina.\n\nMost of the interview was ignorant and irresponsible. It was a missed opportunity to continue a dialogue around representation and colorism in the entertainment industry on the mega platform that is The Breakfast Club. Kudos to Amara La Negra, however, for her attempt to keep the conversation going and for representing for the little dark-skinned girls who may think they\u2019re not beautiful.

Customer demand for high-quality products with a luxury feel aimed at a black and brown audience\u2014ticketed at drugstore price points\u2014has been pent up for decades. This is in response to shifting demographics as much as customer needs; by 2028, the majority of Americans 18-25 years old will be people of color for the first time in history.\n\nThe flood of affordable, accessible and increasingly natural products aimed at black and brown consumers shows no signs of slowing on Target\u2019s shelves. This month, cult favorite the Lip Bar, founded by Detroiter and former financial analyst Melissa Butler, joined Target\u2019s roster of in-store offerings.\n\nThe Lip Bar\u2019s range of vegan, cruelty-free, deeply pigmented liquid lipsticks is just the latest high-quality, for-us, by-us product to land a spot next to cornerstone brands in the ethnic category, like Carol\u2019s Daughter (now owned by L\u2019Oreal) and Iman cosmetics (now owned by Procter & Gamble), both top sellers since debuting at Target in 2014 and 2012, respectively.\n\nAt press time, I counted 17 black-owned brands available at Target. Fourteen out of those 17 lines were natural-product ranges, a fact that reflects the growing concern among women in our community about moving away from chemical agents in our beauty routines, in everything from natural-hair products to lipstick to body lotions.\n\nIn conversation with The Glow Up, Melissa Butler says frankly, \u201cI am not passionate about makeup.\u201d Rather, she is passionate \u201cabout changing the narrative around the way black women are sold cosmetics.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat Butler realized was that no one was answering the question for the robust customer base buying natural-hair-care products as to where they could also buy natural or organic makeup brands.\n\nButler took a nontraditional route to sell her products to the popular big-box chain. With nerves and business acumen developed as a former Wall Street financial analyst, she contacted Target\u2019s cosmetics buyer directly. Big conglomerates control the color-cosmetics aisles; it\u2019s a near impossible feat for independent brands to get distribution without the backing of a L\u2019Oreal or a Procter & Gamble (backing Carol\u2019s Daughter and Iman, respectively) secured as an aid to initial entree into Target.\n\nBut even though Butler went directly to the store\u2019s buyers, there are no shortcuts to the front of the shelf when it comes to a multibillion-dollar retailer like Target. The Lip Bar has been available via Target.com since October 2016, proving itself through \u201cmessaging that sets us apart.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Lip Bar speaks to customers through the use of nontraditional models and positive messaging that tells women they are already beautiful.\n\nAs Butler says, \u201cOur lipsticks add to their overall health and beauty, and we offer the highest-quality natural and organic products at about 60 percent less than comparable brands.\u201d\n\nPhoto: TheDoux.com\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCourtney Foster, a spokesperson for Target, spoke to The Glow Up about the growing family of brands directed at an ethnic audience, not all of which are wholly black-owned: \u201cThis winter, we launched more than 10 new brands, including the Lip Bar, the Doux, Urban RX and Koils by Nature, bringing our total multicultural beauty assortment to more than 100 brands.\u201d\n\nHow much is this market worth to Target\u2019s bottom line? Foster says, \u201cThough we cannot disclose sales information, we will continue to invest in our multicultural offerings and grow our assortment to include offerings that we believe will resonate with our guests.\u201d\n\nWith an estimated $46 billion beauty market in the U.S., of which black women account for roughly 22 percent of the total spend, that sales number has to be quite significant. Target is the third-largest retailer in the world, with 1,822 stores in the U.S. alone, as well as online sales, and a continued commitment to pledging 5 percent of net profits to charities based in the communities served by the retailer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll of this is good news for the black-owned brands populating Target\u2019s inventory, as well as for our communities, as it has enormous potential to create positive cash flow back into communities of color.\n\nOf the 10 newly launched brands, there are a few standouts for us here at The Glow Up: The Doux, a natural-hair-care brand based on old-school hip-hop aesthetics is the definition of funky-fresh packaging\u2014Bonita Afro Balm, anyone? The line is aimed at everything from locs to perms, so you don\u2019t have to bounce around between product lines to get the the look you or your family might want.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, Koils by Nature blends bases of Jamaican castor and argan oils that double as hair treatments and body butters in unisex scents, providing a solution for the whole family to use in a single pared-down product line.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s not black-owned, Urban Rx was developed with black and brown women in mind: It\u2019s a simple one-step makeup remover, cleansing mask and facial wash in a solid gel formulation.\n\nWhat do all of these products have in common? A luxury feel and a nice price. As Melissa Butler says, \u201cI want to make black women feel really special, and it means a lot to me to be able to do it at a very real price point.\u201d", "keywords": ["women", "lip", "target", "beauty", "brands", "butler", "targets", "black", "blackowned", "products"], "polarity": 0.10695477945477945, "subjectivity": 0.40922779922779934},

Before CrossFit, I could barely run 2 miles. I did a 3-miles-for-30-days challenge at first. CrossFit has great coaches. I never got hurt. It was the most challenging workout I\u2019ve ever done.

I ballooned up to, like, 170 pounds. I\u2019m 5 feet 8, so to most people, it didn\u2019t look like I was big. It\u2019s just too much weight on my frame.\n\nTGU: What does that mean for you?\n\nAM: My legs, feet and lower back start bothering me, and I know I need to lose 5-7 pounds. That goes a long way on my frame.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: How\u2019s your sleep?\n\nAM: I sleep pretty well some nights, but with the hormonal changes I\u2019m going through, sometimes I can wake up really hot at 4 a.m. and not fall asleep until 5.

Long meditation is still not my thing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: How would you define ageless beauty?\n\nAM: Ageless beauty is accepting all of your flaws, and realizing you\u2019re beautiful. I was stabbed in the face when I was 16 years old. I had to get 150 stitches. And I\u2019ve suffered psoriasis all over my face and body since I was 13 years old. My teenage years were really rough, self-esteem-wise. I hated my skin. I used to try to hide it, because on my medium-brown skin, psoriasis leaves scars.\n\nTGU: How did you cope?\n\nAM: In my 30s, I saw a therapist for a short period.

According to the Post, Trump asked him to step aside on Friday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn October of last year it was reported that Tillerson called Trump a \u201cfucking moron\u201d in a meeting. Tillerson then had to publicly grovel and affirm that Trump was indeed \u201csmart,\u201d but the sense that his time was coming to an end still hung in the air\u2014so much so that Trump had to publicly refute it. Here is a fun tweet from just last December:\n\nGina Haspel, deputy director of the CIA, has been nominated to succeed Pompeo. As a CIA officer under George W.

To honor drug-policy reformers on the front lines, for Black History Month, the Drug Policy Alliance, in partnership with The Root, is bringing you the stories of four phenomenal people who have been instrumental in shaping conversations around drug policy and its lethal effects on black communities around the country. To launch the series, we spoke with Wanda James, CEO of the Denver-based cannabis dispensary SimplyPure. Next, we spoke with Columbia University professor Samuel K. Roberts Jr. about the history of the drug war and how it violently pierces black history in the United States. Here, we bring you the story of Susan Burton, founder and executive director of A New Way of Life Reentry Project.\n\n\n\nIn 1981, Susan Burton\u2019s 5-year-old son, her baby, ran into the street outside their home in South Los Angeles and was killed when a Los Angeles police officer struck him with his car.\n\n\n\nAnd he kept going.\n\n\u201cThe policeman never even stayed around,\u201d Burton, 64, told The Root. \u201cIt was almost like it was a hit-and-run. And all I knew is when I was sitting in the hospital, a whole army of police officers descended into the hospital.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey never ever ever even said, \u2018Ms. Burton, I\u2019m sorry,\u2019\u201d Burton said, hurt and anger still evident in her voice. \u201cAnd that just added, you know, another layer of pain and feeling like ... like, worthless that these people didn\u2019t even acknowledge me.\u201d\n\n\n\nBurton could not escape her grief, so she sought refuge in crack cocaine, the only relief she could find from an all-encompassing, debilitating pain that no mother should ever have to bear. And for nearly 20 years, she spiraled in addiction as she cycled in and out of prison on nonviolent drug charges.\n\n\n\nIn 1997, as Burton exited prison for the sixth time, a prison guard said, \u201cI\u2019ll see you back in a little while.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe would not return, but her road would not be easy.\n\n\n\nBurton could not find a job because of her criminal record. She could not access food stamps or housing assistance. Determined to stay drug-free despite the immense hardships she faced, she entered into a rehabilitation facility, and upon her release, a friend helped her find a job caring for an elderly woman.\n\n\n\nAnd a vision was born.\n\n\n\nBurton knew there were other women like her in need of assistance, love and support to navigate a world slowly killing them from the inside. So she began inviting women she knew who had been recently released from prison to stay at her home in South Los Angeles.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe transformed her home into a refuge, a warm place to heal and start over. In 2000 she incorporated her growing efforts into A New Way of Life Reentry Project, which currently assists 32 women and about four children re-enter society with the support system they need. Since 1998, the organization has helped more than 1,000 women discover a new way of life, serving about 60 women per year.\n\nBlack women, in particular, have to fight to be mothers in a white supremacist society we were not meant to survive free. We have to fight to raise our children in relative safety, to provide for them, to feed them and clothe them, to educate them, to love them in a society that threatens to snatch their lives away from us while we reach for them with desperate hands.\n\n\n\nSo, what happens when you compound these conditions with the carceral state and the drug war in which black women are primary targets, not simply adjacent to the criminalization of black men? What happens when we are pathologized as bad mothers, unstable mothers, unworthy mothers?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat happens when our lives become fathomless pits of institutionalized cruelty, grief and despair, and drugs offer the only fleeting relief available?\n\n\u201cEvery time I was released, I swore I wasn\u2019t going back,\u201d said Burton in a 2010 CNN interview. \u201cBut I know now that without the resources and support, it\u2019s next to impossible. ... If you don\u2019t have a new door to walk through, the only thing is the old door.\u201d\n\nIn the conversation below, Burton talks about the stigma placed on black mothers, the institutional barriers black women face trying to access freedom for themselves and, if they have them, for their children, and how whiteness functions with deliberate cruelty.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Root: Addiction and poverty are symptoms of the malignancy of white supremacy, but society, especially when it comes to black women, never wants to treat the disease, it wants to criminalize the people suffering from it. Speak to those issues that black women face on an intimate level.\n\nSusan Burton: What I see overall is poverty in this country treated as a weakness and people who are impoverished are used by other people to enhance their wealth. For instance, in my community, there are places with payday loans on every corner. There is over-policing and excessive use of force and just excessive police presence and lack of services, trauma services, services to address violence. So everything is always met with a gun or handcuffs by law enforcement.\n\n\n\nAnd I mean, there\u2019s just better ways to address the poverty, which is a symptom of everything else. Poverty produces symptoms of other things like drug use and violence. People want to escape through drug use. And instead of treating and supporting people to divert them from drug use or understanding that this is their body\u2014and what they put in their body you should not be able to control it or demonize it or criminalize it\u2014they are punished. Punishment on top of suffering.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: I completely respect and understand that this may be difficult for you to discuss, and I don\u2019t want to place an emotional burden on you at all. So, if we can, I\u2019d like to talk about your son. You began to self-medicate, and that path led you into the criminal-justice system?\n\n\n\nSB: When I was suffering the grief and loss of my son, you know, I medicated that. It felt like there was a, just a ball of nothing, nothingness, painful nothingness, in my center, and see, it was a policeman that killed my son. It was an LAPD detective that killed my son. I felt so angry and hurt that they never even acknowledged it, never even acknowledged me and what they took from me. My son.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: I\u2019m thinking right now about reproductive justice. You had an LAPD officer take your son from you, steal your son\u2019s life from you, from him, and then you have them killing us, gunning down our children in the streets, and then you have them criminalizing parents in these conditions that this white supremacist society\u2014that hates women, hates blackness, hates poverty\u2014creates in the first place. And then you have police officers with a license to kill.\n\n\n\nSB: Yes, and then, speaking on reproductive justice, they are locking us up in our reproductive years. So many men and women are locked up through their reproductive years. It\u2019s genocidal, what they\u2019re doing. And out here in California, 6 percent of the overall population is black women, but black women make up 29 percent of the prison population. It is genocidal.\n\n\n\n(Editor\u2019s note: From fiscal years 2005-06 to 2012-13, the state of California sterilized women without proper consent, a state audit found. At least 35 black women were sterilized during this time period, but the number is potentially much higher. Most of the women who were coerced into undergoing tubal ligation had low education levels and had been pregnant multiple times. California banned forced sterilization in 1979.)\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: Also, the system is so quick to label black women as \u201cbad mothers.\u201d\n\n\n\nSB: Exactly. I have a woman here, Ingrid, who just got out of prison. She ran into the store to grab milk and Pampers for her baby, and came back out and got arrested for child endangerment. She was sent to prison for three years. Still in the midst, I believe that what she was suffering from was postpartum depression. The way black women with mental-health issues are treated in this country is just horrible.\n\n\n\nTR: Some years ago, I reported on a black mother, Frankea Dabbs, who was clearly suffering from mental illness after experiencing immense trauma in her life. She left her 10-month-old daughter on a subway platform and was instantly vilified. But we have white women who kill their children and empathy is widespread. And, according to a 2009 study conducted by the U.S. National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health study:\n\n\n\nThe rates of mental-health problems are higher than average for black women because of psychological factors that result directly from their experience as black Americans. These experiences include racism, cultural alienation, and violence and sexual exploitation. ... African Americans in low-income, urban communities are at high risk for exposure to traumatic events, including having relatives murdered and their own experience with physical and sexual assaults, all of which are associated with the onset of post-traumatic stress syndrome and depression.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSB: And that depression, that grief, often leads to drug abuse, right? And you know, those drugs just didn\u2019t pop up in our community. They were sent to our community. I\u2019m really clear that, that the amount of drugs that came into our community didn\u2019t come in there by our community members. You know, this was a deliberate tearing apart of our black community. And everything they\u2019ve done to us has been deliberate.\n\nWhen I was suffering the grief and loss of my son, you know, I medicated that. It felt like there was a, just a ball of nothing, nothingness, painful nothingness, in my center.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd I\u2019m watching now, the opiate use by other folks and, all of a sudden, it\u2019s, \u201cOh, we have a health problem here.\u201d But with the cocaine use, we had a criminal problem. So I\u2019m watching that and saying, you know, this is what they do. This is what white folks do, you know, they criminalize black people, they offer support to other people. I\u2019ve watched the breaking down of our family structures through incarceration and separation and criminalization of our communities.\n\n\n\nI remember in a movie I saw, it may have been Roots, and I remember the woman saying, \u201cMaster, master please don\u2019t sell my baby. Master, master please, I\u2019ll do anything, don\u2019t take my baby.\u201d And I watch black women go through the court system and they say, \u201cJudge, judge, please let me have my baby back, I\u2019ll do anything. Judge, judge please let me have my baby back.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd because a woman is criminalized doesn\u2019t mean she is unfit or she\u2019s not a good mom. But I watch that judge, regardless of what that woman tries to do in dire, dire circumstances, not give that woman back custody of her child. And it\u2019s heart-wrenching and it\u2019s heartbreaking.\n\n\n\nSo many men and women are locked up through their reproductive years. It\u2019s genocidal what they\u2019re doing.\n\nTR: And that\u2019s another way the criminal injustice system robs black women of motherhood.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSB: So, what do you do? Where do you run to? That woman is pretty much powerless to do anything but curl up in a ball or self-medicate, right? So, you know, I know what it feels like to lose a child. But sometimes, it\u2019s that that child gets put in the foster care system and, many times, they end up feeling abandoned, no love, and they self-medicate that pain, too. I see the breaking, the criminalization, the hurt and the pain through these systems that is just, oh, it\u2019s unconscionable.\n\n\n\nTR: And that leverage is also used to assault black women, right? Sexual assault is the second-highest reported form of police brutality after excessive force, and women of color are more likely to be attacked. So, you look at someone like [former Oklahoma City Police Officer] Daniel Holtzclaw, who targeted women like you, with prior charges. He targeted black women that he knew were vulnerable, black women (and one black girl) who were fearful of the criminal-justice system, and he raped them.\n\n\n\nSB: This goes on, and I know that you know that to law enforcement, black women are criminal. At every level, they abuse women, whether it\u2019s rape, you know, whether it\u2019s strip searches, whether it\u2019s dehumanizing them. I walk into a jail now to visit women, and the women are trained to turn from me and look at the wall. And I just want to cry for them. So all of these are forms of violence and dehumanization. All of them.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: You said something earlier about how society should not police what people put into their bodies, and that\u2019s such an important point. We talk about the shame and the stigma attached to what is put into our bodies. They will criminalize the body; they will shackle the body, and they will do all these things to control us, as opposed to looking at this system that really needs to be broken, because it\u2019s functioning exactly as it\u2019s supposed to. They won\u2019t address poverty, but they\u2019ll police those living in poverty. They won\u2019t address public schools that are intentionally allowed to fail in the service of privatization, but they will keep the school-to-prison pipeline running smoothly.\n\n\n\nSB: That\u2019s exactly it. It is a system that needs to be interrupted. When I, when my son died, the grief, the pain that I was in, you know, I needed something to help me cope with that. I\u2019ve seen people in physical pain, and I\u2019ve seen people in dire mental distress. The level of grief I was in, I needed something to deal with that pain, that rage. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d have done to get through that. So I used drugs; I used until I found another solution.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was never offered help when I stood in front of the judge and told them what had happened in my life. They hit the gavel and sent me to prison, had me stripped down and inspected like a slave. Handcuffed and sent me to work for 8 cents an hour.\n\n\n\nI know that given my circumstances, there could have been services and trauma centers available to help me through such a difficult time, but there was not. So what I do now is free women up from that same system. If I can, I help them get their baby back; I do that. I take them to court. I write letters. I stand in front of that judge. I help them meet that court requirement.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause what I know is, I can\u2019t get my baby back, but I can help another woman get hers. I can\u2019t take back the years, the time stolen from me, but I can stop another woman from giving all of her years. And that\u2019s what I do.\n\n", "keywords": ["know", "women", "freedom", "susan", "war", "son", "drug", "drugs", "black", "system", "motherhood", "woman", "baby", "liberator", "burton", "prison"], "polarity": -0.05518481947605659, "subjectivity": 0.43063863971080474},

King Kendrick led the field with a whopping 11 noms, confirming that Kendrick's 2015 will be one of those years remembered much more fondly by music critics than music fans. (And, before you get your pitchforks out, I'm not saying To Pimp A Butterfly wasn't a great and ambitious album and that it doesn't deserve all of the accolades its receiving. Just that, generally speaking, the love music writers and music critics have for it seems to have surpassed its connection to actual music fans.)\n\nBut I'm not here today to talk about people who were nominated. Instead, I'm more interested in who wasn't nominated. Namely, Omarion. I'm interested in Omarion.\n\nWhy am I interested in Omarion? Why I am compelled to write a sentence (\"I'm interested in Omarion\") I never thought about or wrote \u2014 or considered thinking about or writing \u2014 before today? Because, after the Grammy nominations were released, Omarion went to Twitter to express how upset he was that \"Post to Be\" \u2014 the ubiquitous track featuring Chris Brown and Jhene Aiko \u2014 didn't receive any nominations.\n\nIt wasn't a tirade as much as it was a rant; Omarion was clearly upset, but ultimately he didn't say anything too outrageous. Or, to be honest, anything too wrong. It is hard to make a hit, the odds have been against him, and he could very well be Jesus. (Seriously, I can't say with 100% certainty that Omarion is not Jesus. And if I can't do that, I know you can't either.)\n\nMost importantly, Omarion was right about \"Post to Be.\" Because it was a song that prominently and repeatedly featured the line \"eat the booty like groceries.\" This, alone, is worthy of a Grammy nomination. And every nomination for every award that allows for nominations. It deserves all the nominations and all the awards. They should just rename the \"Grammys\" to the \"Posttobes\" and change the trophy from a golden gramophone to a platinum bust of a booty with a face stuck inside of it. And, if you win one, you get free groceries for a year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou might think this is all in jest, that I can't possibly be serious about this song's artistic merit. But what's the point of even having an annual celebration of excellence in music if you don't acknowledge the the type of creativity it takes to craft a song around a surprisingly adroit comparison of analingus to Walmart produce and have that song actually air on the radio? Also, no other single entity has done as much to destigmatize ass-eating. Before, ass-eaters lived in the shadows and in silence, concealing their true identities and downplaying their natural proclivities. Now, ass-eaters move among us joyfully and freely, like a bird. A free-spirited, ass-eating bird.\n\nAnd if this isn't enough to gain a Grammy nom, well, then I don't know what else Omarion can do. Maybe prove he's actually the Son of God and do something impossible, like bring B2K back together.", "keywords": ["interested", "deserves", "wasnt", "grammy", "omarion", "right", "groceries", "song", "music", "im", "nominations", "eat", "booty", "cant", "upset"], "polarity": 0.1725221483942414, "subjectivity": 0.5600775193798451},

Leveraging their popular podcast into TV stardom, \u201cthe Bodega Boys\u201d riff on popular culture, politics and (mostly) white people. They\u2019ve become the popular destination for the coolest guests because their show is basically The Daily Show if Trevor Noah were a pair of weed-smoking, 40-ounce-drinking dudes from the Bronx, N.Y..\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Bodega Boys\u2019 beef with DJ Envy began when text messages surfaced of DJ Envy (who is married) chatting with someone who suggested butt play with the Power 105.1 FM host. As usual, Desus and Mero became the hood version of CNN, exposing the story:\n\nThe dispute continued when DJ Envy appeared on an episode of The Real with his wife, seemingly trying to contain the damage. The couple was very honest about the radio host\u2019s past indiscretions, making it appear that they had fixed all of their problems. Desus and Mero, who never shy away from controversy, made fun of the appearance by Envy and his wife because ... well, that\u2019s what they do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, on Thursday morning, Desus and Mero appeared on The Breakfast Club. Envy was in his feelings from the time the men walked in, and there was nothing wrong with that except the men didn\u2019t realize there was a beef.\n\n\n\nAfter introducing his guests as \u201cDickhead\u201d and \u201cPussy,\u201d which is mad passive-aggressive and totally light-skinned, Envy began to explain the impetus behind his beige rage. (Oh, did I mention that Envy was sporting a \u201cMy God vs. My Enemies\u201d hat, which was totally planned because isn\u2019t it just like a light-skinned man to wear passive-aggressive clothing to a fuss fight?)\n\n\u201cYou owe my wife an apology,\u201d Envy said to a baffled Desus and Mero. \u201cWhen you insinuated that she was there for the check.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen DJ Envy played the clip in which Desus and Mero totally insinuated that Envy\u2019s wife was sticking around for the check. Envy wasn\u2019t going full light-skinned for being mad about that. It was a low blow for the talk show guests to take shots at Envy\u2019s wife. Envy explained that wives and children were off-limits, and the guests agreed and apologized.\n\nWhere Envy drove his Jeep Grand Cherokee off the road (yes, Jeep Grand Cherokees are the preferred cars of light-skinned men; just ask any Kappa) was when he couldn\u2019t let it go. He literally stewed in his anger like a spoiled child unable to accept that he\u2019d actually gotten his way. Not sure if Envy came into work looking for a fight, but what he found was an apology, and that wasn\u2019t good enough.\n\nEnvy proceeded to hard-chew his gum (totally light-skinned and passive-aggressive), and make snide remarks before he went full Sinbad and walked off the show, undoing all of Matt Barnes\u2019 good work to dispel the myth that light-skinned men will walk off the air.\n\nAt that point, if Envy was still upset, he should\u2019ve reached across the table and taken a swing at Desus (because Mero is heavier; Dominican\u2014which means there is a 62 percent chance he had a razor under his tongue; and because I\u2019m not here for light-skinned-on-light-skinned crime).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know, because that is what rapper Casanova 2x would\u2019ve done. He is my spiritual guide whenever I\u2019m trying to sort out whether or not I\u2019m inside my light-skinned bag. I can\u2019t see Casanova 2x pushing the microphone away and storming out of the interview after receiving an apology, if for no other reason than he made this song and you can\u2019t get passive-aggressive after rhyming that you would punch someone\u2019s teeth out.\n\nMy sources tell me that Envy walked off the air and into his office, where he took a few swings at the air and then curled up on the floor in the fetal position and had a good cry, and it was well-earned.

Envy, Charlamagne tha God and Angela Yee.\n\nHill not only talked about his road to success\u2014from dropping out of Morehouse to homelessness, from selling incense on the streets of Atlanta to receiving a Ph.D.\u2014but also made it clear that when it comes to the 2016 presidential election, there is no \"lesser of two evils\" in our current political duopoly.\n\nW.E.B. Du Bois said in 1956, \u201cI believe that democracy has so far disappeared in the United States that no \u2018two evils\u2019 exist.\u201d Hill takes that philosophy and makes it plain.\n\n\n\nThe DNC disappointed me because it looked like a Republican convention. \u2026 \u201c[Democrats] tried to take the patriotism language that the Republicans usually use in their conferences and used it for their own. They talked about war. They talked about the economy in a way that sounded like Republicans from 20 years ago. Part of the reason it was so easy for Melania to jack Michelle Obama\u2019s speech is because they\u2019re all saying the same stuff. I'm not scared of Trump. I'm scared of us as a country moving in the wrong direction. \u2026 Republicans are always talking about terrorism, but Democrats are playing on a certain kind of terrorism, too. They're essentially saying, \u2018If you don't vote for us, then you're going to have Donald Trump and your life will be ruined.\u2019 If you frame that as the choice, you never get to demand what you actually deserve and what you actually want.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen D.J.

But if the differences between the two candidates aren't vast enough, then I would rather introduce a third candidate to build a movement. Because every four years we say, 'The third party can't win.' So we never invest in the third party. We never grow the third party. If they get 5 percent of the vote, they can be in the debates. And if they're in the debates, now we can change the conversation.\n\nAfter Envy said that Democrats voting third party would take votes away from Clinton, ultimately paving the way for a Donald Trump presidency, Hill laid the truth on the table:\n\n\n\nI would rather have Trump be president for four years and build a real left-wing movement that can get us what we deserve as a people, than to let Hillary be president and we stay locked in the same space where we don't get what we want.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHill went on to say that he would rather Trump not be president, period, but that we can't keep investing in \"imperfect Democrats who don't take us anywhere.\"\n\n\n\nWe can afford to lose an election; we can't afford to lose our values.\n\nWatch below for Hill talking more Trump, \"black-on-black\" crime as pathology and Drake's \"light-skin\" music:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso on The Root: \u201cDear Centrists: The Left Has Something to Say Whether You Like It or Not\u201d", "keywords": ["lamont", "republicans", "trump", "vote", "green", "talked", "democrats", "party", "election", "values", "say", "afford", "marc", "lose", "hill", "theyre", "president", "voting"], "polarity": 0.07415824915824916, "subjectivity": 0.40971620971620976},
{"url": "https://theglowup.theroot.com/jackie-aina-youtube-style-warrior-1823281007", "title": "/jackie-aina-youtube-style-warrior-", "text": "Jackie Aina/YouTube\n\nBeauty vlogger Jackie Aina, 30, is a member of the U.S. Army Reserve and has 2 million YouTube subscribers and counting. Averaging around 600,000 views per post, her funny and frank videos, like \u201cBougie and Bad on a Budget\u201d and \u201cEdges Slaughtered,\u201d bring the real on the makeup tip, touching on issues of race and money in ways that make viewers laugh as much as they learn.\n\nThe Glow Up caught up with Aina a few days after she made history as the first social media star to receive the coveted NAACP Image Award. She told us:\n\nTen years ago, when I started my YouTube channel, it was hard for me to find darker-skinned black women that did makeup the way I like to. I was used to hearing that things \u201cdon\u2019t look good on you\u201d or \u201cyou can\u2019t wear that kind of makeup.\u201d I struggled with being a woman who\u2014people see you with makeup on and dressed nicely, people assume \u201cshe doesn\u2019t work very hard because she doesn\u2019t have to\u201d; [it] made being taken seriously a struggle.\n\nObviously, as a member of the U.S. Army Reserve, Aina is no stranger to hard work. She said that \u201cwomen who enjoy makeup and feeling good, there\u2019s often a lot more to it,\u201d citing the example of women recovering from cancer learning to put their eyebrows back on, or women in uniform, like herself, who want to assert their individuality.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a double minority as a black woman, so I fight through a lot in that regard,\u201d she said. As a woman in the military, \u201cpeople think we\u2019re tomboys or slobs; they say, \u2018You\u2019re too pretty; how could you be in the Army? Whatever that means.\u201d\n\nDuring our conversation, the question Aina seemed to be wrestling with is why women\u2019s motives and values are in question when they want to be at their most presentable: \u201cThe message I want to get across is that whether you want to wear makeup or not, it\u2019s OK to go the extra mile to look your best.\u201d Passion mounted in her voice as she said that she never wants stereotypes about women in uniform \u201cto overshadow the fact that some of us are artistic and creative; we are multifaceted\u2014wearing lipstick and lashes doesn\u2019t make us any less hard workers.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Aina, being beautifully turned out represents \u201cbeing knowledgeable; people come to me for help, and I know I\u2019m good at it.\u201d She pointed to prejudices surrounding beauty, like the now defunct \u201cTake Her Swimming on the First Date\u201d memes, where men were urged to take their date for a dip in order to remove the mask of makeup and discover how truly attractive or unattractive she really is. Aina said:\n\nI don\u2019t think people realize that women genuinely enjoy it. I can go all up and down Instagram and see women with murals literally painted on their faces. Obviously, it\u2019s not ideal for work, but it\u2019s about the fact that we\u2019ve gone way beyond thinking of makeup as a way to hide or to cover up. It\u2019s a form of expression for not only me but a lot of people.\n\nBeing a black person pioneering in any business\u2014Aina has been a vlogger for more than a decade now\u2014has its perks. If you\u2019re good, being first to market can mean not only capturing market share but also defining the category, as she has done. But outliers like Aina also face challenges. In a post called \u201cI Don\u2019t See Color,\u201d she explores questions of race through the lens of the beauty business. She tells us:\n\nI\u2019m not ... just a black beauty blogger. I have dark skin and that shapes my experiences. Being that I\u2019m an African blogger who considers herself Nigerian first\u2014my mother is African American and my dad is Nigerian\u2014I never kind of feel African enough or Nigerian enough. I never know where I kind of fit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s a struggle that most blacks in this country feel on some level every day: that our black cards could be revoked by anyone for not achieving the impossible task of representing the entire black experience as just one person. Aina said:\n\nOne thing that I\u2019ve brought a lot of attention to on my YouTube channel, if you are racially ambiguous\u2014like you skew Asian\u2014it can be a lot easier. When people see more than black, they see mass-market appeal, [and] are more willing to give you a chance. People look at me, and they only see black. It means that people think my content isn\u2019t enjoyable to people who don\u2019t have the same color skin as I do. When it comes to buying foundation and cultural experiences, we want someone who we can relate to ... but I bet that people who won\u2019t give people who look like me a chance on YouTube have pretty homogeneous social and professional circles, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAina urges us \u201cto switch it up and be supportive of other people of color in our industry\u2014[they] can be Latin or Indian, and I enjoy their content.\u201d To this end, she actively seeks out other vloggers who are the polar opposite, not only of her skin color and skin type\u2014Aina has oily skin and can advise women of all skin types\u2014but also to learn what\u2019s on the market and to get further inspiration about what makes women feel beautiful.\n\nIn February 2018, Aina received an NAACP Image Award, the first social media star to hold the honor. She told us: \u201cYou know, I never thought that social change could come about through makeup. All I want to do is enrich the lives of other people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is an acknowledgment that this makeup artist\u2014whose collaborations include becoming a Global United Nations change ambassador in partnership with YouTube, and a line of makeup highlighters with Artists Couture Cosmetics\u2014counts as \u201cthe most important thing that\u2019s happened to me and honors all the creators out there that are often overlooked.\u201d\n\nIn her role as a U.N. change ambassador, Aina\u2019s mission is twofold: to close the gender pay gap and to reach out to people and make them feel seen \u201cso that the way they see themselves changes the world sees them.\u201d\n\nJackie Aina, we definitely see you.", "keywords": ["social", "look", "women", "youtube", "makeup", "warrior", "skin", "jackie", "lot", "black", "way", "style", "aina"], "polarity": 0.13574263038548753, "subjectivity": 0.4877267573696145},

Needless to say, we were eager to know what holiday makeup tips this face-making guru had to share with us, but as it turns out, Aunique\u2019s interested in making more than pretty faces ...\n\nInstead of talking about beauty, this beauty wanted to talk about ... beards.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that 2017 was the Year of the Beard; one need only ask the 1,751,033 members (and climbing) of the official Beard Game Matters closed Facebook group. But for those of us who have been longtime beard lovers, it\u2019s been a bit anticlimactic to watch the rest of the world catch on to what we been knowin\u2019: Beards are sexy as hell.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nActually, let me clarify: Well-groomed beards are sexy as hell.\n\nAt the time of our meeting, it seems that Aunique had just gotten her well-manicured hands on a pair of brand-new Beard & Stache Balms by natural-skin-care company Anlea Essentials. She was eager to put them to use\u2014which she did, on The Root senior reporter Terrell Jermaine Starr\u2019s beard\u2014and a convert was born.\n\nThese shea-based balms also include natural oils and two memorable scents: Debonair Dude and Husband Material (hint, hint).

Not only does it sell a deliciously sexy-smelling beard oil using sandalwood, cedarwood and eucalyptus essential oils, but its men\u2019s skin-care collection is one of the most extensive on the market, with over 30 selections to choose from, available in most major cities and department stores.\n\nAunique\u2019s picks?

To honor drug-policy reformers on the front lines, for Black History Month, the Drug Policy Alliance, in partnership with The Root, is bringing you the stories of four phenomenal people who have been instrumental in shaping conversations around drug policy and its lethal effects on black communities around the country. To launch the series, we spoke with Wanda James, CEO of the Denver-based cannabis dispensary Simply Pure. Here we speak with Columbia University professor Samuel K. Roberts Jr.\n\n\n\nWhat does it mean to reduce the harm of white supremacy? How can we, as a society, look beyond drug abuse as an illness and reckon with anti-black oppression, punishment and capitalism as the cruelest addictions in this country?\n\n\n\nIn that context, white supremacy is the pusher, but black people aren\u2019t the ones with the habit.\n\n\n\nSamuel K. Roberts Jr., Ph.D.\u2014director of the Columbia University Institute for Research in African-American Studies, associate professor of history at Columbia\u2019s School of Arts and Sciences, and associate professor of sociomedical sciences at Columbia\u2019s Mailman School of Public Health\u2014is an expert in the field of African-American and public health history and politics.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRoberts is currently researching a book project on the history of drug-addiction policy and politics from the 1950s to the present, a period that encompasses the various heroin epidemics between the 1950s and the 1980s, therapeutic communities, radical recovery movements, methadone maintenance treatment and harm-reduction approaches.\n\n\n\nRoberts\u2019 focus on harm reduction for people of color encompasses much more than ensuring individual safety; rather, it is about dismantling systems that are unsafe for black people in the United States of America.\n\n\n\nIn our wide-ranging interview, Roberts and I discussed radical recovery; the critical need for \u201charm reduction of color\u201d to end the so-called war on drugs, which has always been a war against the most oppressed and has targeted black and brown communities; and why \u201cwhite flight\u201d is a misnomer that gives entirely too much credit to whiteness.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Root: Let\u2019s talk about the critical need for harm reduction of color. Because that specificity and intentionality, that reframing, is not something that is discussed enough.\n\n\n\nSamuel K. Roberts Jr.: Yes, HROC, harm reduction of color, is a specific view. Harm-reduction-of-color critique in particular is concerned with structural inequality. So it recognizes the whole social issues of drugs and the political aspects of drugs as being bound up with structures that are in place, with the effect and the function of maintaining inequality for people of color and communities of color.\n\n\n\nFrom this view, we see that there\u2019s a connection between a failing education system, hypervigilant state security systems, the mass carceral state, and deindustrialization and lack of job opportunities. Those are all connected structurally in our harm-reduction-of-color critique. I emphasize harm reduction of color because there are harm-reduction organizations that are just about helping people stay safe as they use drugs, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. But that\u2019s very different from what I\u2019m talking about.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is a protest movement in many ways, or at least an advocacy movement that will ... do that seamless analysis of gender and sexual oppression, economic subjugation and mass incarceration, police brutality\u2014you know, the whole nine. HROC is a political analysis that draws from a decadeslong history of radical movements from the \u201960s and \u201970s and forward, but also drawn more immediately from the energy and analyses offered by the various movements, including the Movement for Black Lives.\n\n\n\nTR: Absolutely, and a large part of that is eradicating the racialized stigma attached to drug use. Not just the stigma, but also poverty, criminalization and addiction ... it\u2019s a lot to dismantle and to reckon with. And in the context of white supremacy, these are radical notions.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKR: Absolutely. An HROC perspective recognizes that stigma actually has a function. That if you\u2019re gonna rationalize locking up 2 million people at any given point in time, as this country has, you have to have an ideology that convinces people that they\u2019re OK with that. So you need to have a series of stigmas about there being violent, predatorial, bad mothers; drains on the welfare state, cheats, you know, unwilling to work, animalistic\u2014all of those things, you know; potential or active terrorists. You need to have all of those in place if you\u2019re gonna get people to sign off on all that, because let\u2019s be clear: Putting together a carceral state is not easy.\n\n\n\nHas anyone been successful convincing the American public to put tens of billions of dollars behind the educational system? No. It\u2019s a lot to convince people to put in that kind of money. So you have to have them scared, and you have to have them thinking that the people against whom the stigmas are being mobilized are really not worthy of any sympathy or any respect, really.\n\nTR: What really stood out to me while reading over your synopsis of your book research was the term \u201cradical recovery.\u201d I\u2019m thinking here about mothers who may lose their job or the father who may have his children taken away. People stand to pay a steep price for speaking out about their addictions, and that can suppress recovery. Can you talk a little bit about the history of radical recovery in movement spaces?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKR: Well, since the ... mid- to late \u201960s, we\u2019ve had a number of instances in which organizations have tied the issue of drugs, drug use, drug policy, to larger socioeconomic and political questions. So the radical part here is, we\u2019re not just talking about plain recovery. A lot of recovery programs are not political, and that\u2019s fine. In fact, some are actually very much, assertively anti-political. In most of your 12-step programs, you don\u2019t come in there talking politics, you know what I mean? Because for them, that detracts or distracts you from your own responsibility and problems.\n\n\n\nThen there\u2019s other organizations that were supported by the Black Panthers and the Young Lords. There was a group called White Lightning, which was an anti-racist, largely white organization. These organizations and other, smaller ones, made the connection between drug use in what was then called America\u2019s ghettos and later called inner cities, or center cities where jobs are basically fleeing. You know, we talk about white flight from neighborhoods, but it\u2019s not so much white flight that\u2019s a problem; it\u2019s capital flight.\n\n\n\nThese neighborhoods didn\u2019t get in trouble because there were no white people there. We could do fine without white people. It\u2019s that all the money left, right? All the jobs left. At the same time, for a young, employable population, if one of the only games in town is the drug trade, well, that\u2019s what you\u2019re gonna do.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: Exactly, and that carried right on over into later decades.\n\n\n\nSKR: Right. In the \u201980s and \u201990s, you know, a number of things happened. First we get HIV ... by the early 1980s, heroin has taken such a toll in black communities\u2014not just heroin use itself, but also the police ramifications that many in our mainstream leadership pushed, the politics of respectability.\n\n\n\nThey basically washed their hands of people who used drugs, and they washed their hands of the issues, any issue besides law and order. And then you combine that with [Ronald] Reagan\u2019s war on drugs, which wasn\u2019t just about locking people up for using drugs; it actually ended up remaking governance itself. And what I mean by that is, imagine a period of time where the surest way you\u2019re gonna get grants from the federal government is to do drug interdiction. Not education, public health\u2014remember, Reagan was cutting down all those; not job training, not community development\u2014Reagan was slashing budgets for all that.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe one thing, if you needed anybody from the federal government to balance your municipal budget, you had to ... basically ask for drug money or drug fighting, drug-war money. So after a few decades of that, then if all you\u2019re carrying is a hammer, everything starts to look like a nail.\n\n\n\n\u201cThese neighborhoods didn\u2019t get in trouble because there were no white people there. We could do fine without white people.\u201d\n\nTR: Absolutely; the same held true for Bill Clinton in the \u201990s and Hillary Clinton\u2019s popularization of John DiIulio Jr.\u2019s term \u201csuperpredator.\u201d Under Clinton, states began passing their own version of \u201cthree strikes\u201d laws, and they were awarded Truth-in-Sentencing grants to build and expand prisons.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSKR: Absolutely. Clinton had the same enthusiasm for all those policies.\n\n\n\nTR: So let\u2019s talk about this country\u2019s commitment to punishment, capitalism and anti-blackness and how it has fueled the so-called drug war\u2014because we know it\u2019s really a war on the most targeted black and brown communities in the country. Now we have this \u201cgentler\u201d war on drugs for white users, but it remains punishment for black people who sell drugs.\n\n\n\nSKR: So we do have to be careful here. Since 1973, with the Rockefeller drug laws, our impulse to separate drug users from so-called drug dealers is actually a pretty artificial one. Most people who use drugs at some point have sold drugs, even if mostly casually. And most people who sell drugs really are doing it just for side money and to support their own habit. So what I\u2019m saying is, it\u2019s very difficult to separate drug dealers from drug users.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s plenty of people who just use drugs and they never sold it. There are people out there who sell drugs and don\u2019t use. But with the majority, there is this overlap. The number of people that we would describe as \u201cking pins\u201d or major distributors is a pretty small number. So we have to be careful with separating the user from the seller, because all discretion is with the prosecution.\n\n\n\nTR: That\u2019s an excellent point. White drug use is primarily a public health issue, even though these white people also sell small quantities of drugs. Black drug sellers, even in small quantities, are hypercriminalized because our judicial system chooses to not see them as users. And if it does, there is stigma attached.\n\n\n\nSKR: And that\u2019s the danger of it, right? Because so much of it is in the eye of the beholder. At what point is somebody a user and at what point are they a dealer? If we decide as a society that we\u2019re going to take a public health approach to drug using, but continue to take a draconian approach to drug dealing, then we really haven\u2019t [done] as much reform as we\u2019ve thought. We can\u2019t demonize one and empathize with the other.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo if you have a white woman who has developed a heroin problem and on the side she\u2019s selling a little bit of heroin to maintain her own habit, somebody might say, \u201cOh, this poor woman; we need to get her a program because she\u2019s not really a dealer.\u201d You can take a black woman in the same case, but it\u2019ll conjure up all these myths of crack moms and black women are terrible mothers, and she gets the book thrown at her.\n\n\n\nHalf a measure of reform is not the full thing. For most of our history, the drugs that we decided are the most dangerous were the ones that were associated with people who were not white. It\u2019s really never about the drug itself, because there is no drug that is so dangerous that it warrants locking somebody up for 25 years of their lives.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: I\u2019m thinking here about [former Oklahoma City Police Officer] Daniel Holtzclaw and how he targeted black women, specifically black women with criminal charges or who had battled some form of addiction and were afraid of being incarcerated. He used his power to do that. We could also look at women who are addicted to drugs and how some of them are not involved in sex work because it\u2019s something that they want to do, necessarily, but something that they need to do to survive.\n\nYou look at what [former Gov.] Mike Pence did in Indiana, stopping the needle-exchange programs and limiting women\u2019s access to reproductive choices, and how that affected women of color and exploded the HIV rate. There is a dangerous intersection of criminalization and misogyny, particularly as it pertains to black women. Sexual assault is the second-highest reported form of police brutality after excessive force.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo this is not only a public health issue for black women, or a criminal issue, but a feminist issue.\n\n\n\nSKR: Absolutely. There\u2019s really so much in terms of drug policy and criminal-justice policy that affects black women in very specific ways. Black women\u2019s incarcerated population mushroomed in the early \u201990s, late \u201990s, and the first decade of the 2000s.\n\n\n\nBlack women in particular are more vulnerable to the problems of fraying community bonds, such as domestic abuse, the state incursions and state violence, and so there\u2019s certain ways in which substance use with black women has its own particular dimensions, as clearly an indication of self-medication. And once they\u2019re in the system, they are particularly more vulnerable to the sexual assault and violence, either in encounters with police officers or with correctional officers. This is a critical issue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: Absolutely. Poverty is also a systemic illness that affects personal wellness in black and brown working-class communities and those living in deep poverty. And while there has been some movement on policy around the country, do you think there has been progress eradicating the intentional stigmas that fuel this oppression?\n\nSKR: Yes, one of the many inspiring things about the Movement for Black Lives is the high proportion of black women, queer and/or trans, in the leadership of these organizations. Because with them comes a very complex and sophisticated analysis of various problems and an ability to connect all those.\n\n\n\nSo if you want to talk to someone, if you want to get some of the most sophisticated analysis of sexual violence and sexual politics, drug policy, war on the poor and war on black people, you talk to a trans activist of color who works with homeless youth. Because they\u2019ve seen all of those things, and it can show how they all seamlessly work in this really hideous system that\u2019s essentially designed to brutalize entire populations. These are individuals that were not in the forefront of black political mobilization even 15 years ago, let alone 50 years ago, at the height of the civil rights movement. We are in a really creative movement in terms of black politics.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFor most of our history, the drugs that we decided are the most dangerous were the ones that were associated with people who were not white. It\u2019s really never about the drug itself, because there is no drug that is so dangerous that it warrants locking somebody up for 25 years of their lives.\u201d\n\nTR: There are a lot of tentacles deeply rooted in the history of black people in the United States that have been shaped by the so-called war on drugs. What does winning this war look like to you?\n\n\n\nSKR: Massive investment in education, obviously, right? But we also need to think about how we plan an economy where there are industries waiting for people who have that education. And that\u2019s gonna take a lot of political will as well. And we need to think about our health infrastructure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs you started off our conversation, where you were saying poverty as a disease ... being poor is probably the most dangerous threat to your health. ... And so we ... need to really work on that infrastructure. Most of the issues that we attribute to drug use will be vastly mitigated if we paid more attention to these other things. When you give people more tools with which they can be in control of their lives, they tend to not be as harmful to themselves or to others. And, in this moment, I\u2019m optimistic that we\u2019ll get there.\n\n\n\nThe so-called war on drugs has been exposed for the capitalist money grab and the white supremacist assault that it is. And this I know to be true: It is our duty to win. We will not allow stigma to infest our communities, and we will continue to fight back when we see it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe will have greater empathy for those who make the decision to self-medicate the pain of struggling to survive in an anti-black society. And we will focus on radical recovery because the shame is not ours, and it never has been.\n\nWe will look at poverty as an illness and not a moral failing, and we will insist, to others and to ourselves, that our humanity in the face of intentional institutional violence and oppression is always worth fighting for.", "keywords": ["roberts", "really", "history", "women", "radical", "white", "k", "need", "war", "scholar", "samuel", "flight", "drug", "drugs", "recovery", "black", "policy", "jr"], "polarity": 0.045231531208974815, "subjectivity": 0.4546037713330948},

Our ultramodern, minimalist office space\u2014although filled with laughter and camaraderie\u2014drops to meat-locker-level temps when the mercury dips. Not to mention, we\u2019re passionate about beauty.\n\nOur latest outing was to an afternoon with Unilever, the parent company of popular brands Degree, TRESemm\u00e9, SheaMoisture, Suave, Nexxus, Axe, Dove and more\u2014and yes, we\u2019re still asking pointed questions about Dove\u2019s racially questionable dustup last year; we\u2019ll circle back on that conversation when we get answers.\n\nIn a carnival-like atmosphere that was part sideshow and part science, aestheticians demonstrated product while scientists explained the molecular get-down of Unilever\u2019s newest products for face, hair and body.\n\nDid you know that every seven seconds you shower, you use enough water to fill a bottle of wine? I had no idea that much clean water gets used up that fast, mostly while we\u2019re trying to rinse conditioner out of our hair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnter Love, Beauty and Planet, a new line of hair and skin-care products engineered to rinse completely clean in half the time of regular conditioners and washes, while ensuring that nothing goes to waste. Most of us don\u2019t know that bottles with labels that are not easily removable are ineligible for recycling and get tossed into garbage dumps; Love, Beauty and Planet\u2019s labels meet this requirement and are 100 percent post-consumer material.\n\nAnd what\u2019s in the bottle? All goodness, with argan and coconut oil formulas and delicious scents. Though you can\u2019t drink them, the idea behind this line is that it\u2019s \u201cfast and fabulous,\u201d carbon neutral, rinses clean quickly and aids in saving 20 percent more water every shower.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDove, well, what can we say? Many of us grew up using its products, and though the company admittedly messed up on that last campaign, some good may have came out of it. Esi Eggleston Bracey, an African-American exec whose hustle and glow over the past decade have made her one of the most powerful in her field, joined Unilever in January as executive vice president and chief operating officer of the company\u2019s North American personal-care business.\n\nIt\u2019s important that we have a seat at the table, not only for gatekeeping our image but, most important, for opening the gates of opportunity when it comes to mentoring and recruiting women of color at the C-suite level of corporate America.\n\nThat said, Dove has both new product and an inclusive, new campaign for DermaSeries, created to treat severely dry skin conditions, including eczema and psoriasis. Ashy folks everywhere, get ready to leave dry skin in the dust; the formulations include rich, hypoallergenic balms that glide on and give an instant glow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs someone who intermittently suffers from eczema, the caring philosophy behind the launch of DermaSeries speaks to the truth that severe skin conditions can rule your life, determining everything from what clothes you can tolerate wearing against your skin to where you\u2019ll go socially because of \u201cgood-skin privilege,\u201d to being able to let someone touch you\u2014even to shake hands or give you a pat on the back. It can be a lot. The women in the campaign\u2014all nonmodels\u2014address conditions that affect 1 in 4 Americans at some point in their lives.\n\n\u201cHi! Want to make a meme?\u201d was the question that came from an unlikely presenter\u2014no more than 15 years old\u2014who made up half of the duo behind the Generation Z consulting firm J\u00fcv. Currently lending their talents to the campaign for Axe body spray, these kids were there to guide us through the feel-good points of the brand\u2019s latest advertising initiative, working in partnership with singer John Legend, among others, to help redefine what it means to be a man, and to help clear the air of toxic ideas about masculinity that have existed in our culture for eons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo, wait; Axe is gender-fluid now?\u201d I asked. \u201cNo ... something like that,\u201d the kid answered, before asking if I knew what memes were. Umm, yeah. I do.\n\nFrom a nearby table stocked with props, I put on my carnival disguise of heart-shaped glasses and fuzzy antennas, and the kid directed me to make a happy face, \u201clike you\u2019re ready for prom in January.\u201d While the marketing exec\u2014who looked like a character from The Big Bang Theory\u2014was snapping away pics on the phone for Insta-stories, I got the spiel for Axe Gold\u2019s kinder, gentler version of masculinity.\n\nThis version encourages men to find their magic ... though I don\u2019t know if #ManMagic will become a thing, like #BlackGirlMagic (I checked\u2014it\u2019s not). It also asks the question, \u201cIs it OK for guys to ... cry, be skinny or be the little spoon?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a \u201cMan Box\u201d study Unilever commissioned from global firm Promundo, the statistics tell a compelling story: When young men feel pressure to conform to negative stereotypes, it often leads to unhealthy behavior\u201481 percent turn to bullying, 71 percent to sexual harassment, and 51 percent experience depression.\n\nThe social-change campaign Senior Orientation was created around John Legend and Axe to demonstrate how delving into your creative side can be a way to escape a host of unhealthy behaviors. Legend told Forbes why he joined the campaign, and shared his thoughts on traditional definitions of masculinity:\n\n\n\nIt can be limiting because it\u2019s all based on stereotypes and dated notions of what men are expected to do in society and the truth is men come in all kinds of varieties and their roles are different depending on who they are, how they were raised and what they want to do in life. We need to allow the space for them to be creative and to be an individual and not be overly constrained by what tradition says men are supposed to do. It can be very limiting to both to men and women to assign these roles, and Axe is tapping that for men, given that it\u2019s their target audience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWho knew all that was going on in a can of body spray? Here at The Glow Up, we love talking about beauty as a means of both expression and empowerment\u2014from luxury-level tech innovations at a drugstore price to black female executives on the rise\u2014and, certainly, our men\u2019s armpits exuding the sweet smell of a safe space.

When you see me on the red carpet or the cover of a magazine, my face is usually clean and simple. And until a few years ago, I\u2019d always had perfect skin. But between multiple childbirths and the hormonal changes that come with babies and the eventual coming of midlife, my skin tone radically changed.\n\n\n\nAll of a sudden, my forehead, upper lips and cheeks became mottled with what looked like cumulous reddish-brown clouds of melanin, about four or five shades darker than the rest of my face. To me, it looked like a mild form of vitiligo or the hide of a spotted pony. Dealing with it definitely slowed my roll getting out of the door in the morning\u2014and got me down\u2014because if I didn\u2019t cover it with makeup, it made me feel tattered-looking and old.\n\nThen I found my daily saving grace: airbrushing on my foundation\u2014and often the rest of my makeup\u2014before I show my face to the world. For two years, the Temptu Air has been my makeup guardian angel. The small airbrush gun, with interchangeable pods of liquid foundations, blushes, eye shadows and bronzers, comes in a battery-operated model you can recharge with a USB port. Better yet, you can throw it in your purse or weekend bag and not worry about needing an arsenal of brushes, pots and powders for touch-ups\u2014you just switch out the pods.\n\nThese days, my morning glow up includes being able to put a face on in five minutes flat, which for me means creating an even-toned, luminous complexion. Granted, there\u2019s some technique involved in getting an airbrush foundation to lay down flawlessly on your face: First, there are three settings on the Temptu Air that control the flow of the fine mist, allowing you to build coverage as you go. Once you choose a setting, you then have to hold the spray gun 4 inches away from your face at a downward angle and move it in a constant, circular motion to avoid streaks and drips, which will happen if you pause too long in one spot. Lastly, it\u2019s important to make sure to let the foundation dry down completely before adding another layer for more coverage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAirbrush foundation is especially great for people who have sensitive skin or acne. With no brushes, sponges or the makeup being exposed to the bacteria on your hands and fingers, it minimizes the chances for irritation or breakouts.\n\nMy teen daughters use their SilkSphere foundation to protect their skin, while I use Temptu\u2019s Hydralock long-wear formula to moisturize and prevent creasing on mine. For indelible brows on fleek, Temptu makes device called AirBrow and a range of stencils. You can even use it on your hair; Temptu has a root-touch-up spray range as well.\n\nAll in all, Temptu foundations come in 18 shades, which may not sound like a lot compared with current offerings of 40 shades of foundations (hi, Fenty Beauty); but Temptu and other airbrush foundations offer buildable, barely detectable, beautiful coverage. It\u2019s one of my best-kept secrets as to why my skin looks so good\u2014and why my co-workers often think I\u2019m not wearing any makeup. Well, the secret\u2019s out: Now you and the rest of The Root office know how I get my daily glow up!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up gift tip: Temptu Airbrush Kits are an awesome gift for a woman on the fly (like our own Webb on the Fly, Veronica Webb).

One cannot discuss black history in its entirety without discussing the war on drugs\u2014and dismantling that war will shape our future.\n\n\n\nIn 2013 this truth led Kassandra Frederique\u2014New York State director for the Drug Policy Alliance, visionary and 2016 The Root 100 honoree\u2014to create a series dedicated to drug-policy reformers to place the urgent need for justice squarely in the Black History Month narrative.\n\n\n\nAt its conception, DPA\u2019s Black History Month series was the birth of awareness for Frederique, who has been at the forefront of the war against drugs since 2009.\n\n\n\nIn February 2012, New York City Police Officer Richard Haste gunned down 18-year-old Ramarley Graham in his grandmother\u2019s home after targeting him on the street. Haste alleged that Graham was selling marijuana and used that unsubstantiated allegation as a rationalization for his cold-blooded execution.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen traces of THC, the chemical found in marijuana, were discovered in Trayvon Martin\u2019s system during the autopsy of his body, racists used that fact to justify George Zimmerman profiling, stalking and ultimately killing him on that rainy night in Sanford, Fla.\n\n\n\n\u201cI knew in that moment if we didn\u2019t connect the way the drug war was killing us, then we were complicit in disappearing their lives,\u201d Frederique says.\n\n\n\nShe\u2019s absolutely right. In 2015 the New York Times declared 1.5 million black men between the ages of 25 and 54 \u201cmissing.\u201d Because of early death and incarceration, there are 1.5 million more black women who are not behind bars than men in that age group. That disparity for whites is virtually nonexistent. One in every 13 black Americans has lost voting rights because of disenfranchisement laws. In 2014 the imprisonment rate for black American women was more than twice that of white women.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese oppressive conditions under an expanded police state can be traced directly to the so-called war on drugs, which is a systemic tool of enslavement. It has ravaged black and Latinx working-class communities, leaving white communities relatively unscathed. It has been positioned as a necessary response to crime and poverty when we know it to be a primary cause.\n\nFor Frederique, it has been critical to connect those dots for people who might not see the broader and deeper picture. And what better time than February?\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Black History Month project started out as an apology,\u201d Frederique tells The Root. \u201cFrom me to myself, to the future black drug-policy reformers that were on their way. I believed this narrative that what was happening to us\u2014incarceration, addiction, family destabilization\u2014was a result of us \u2018getting for what we asked for.\u2019\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI had always asked for a more definitive commitment from our movement on racial justice but I guess I always feared that they would throw back in my face that \u2018we did this,\u2019\u201d Frederique continues. \u201cI think back to my earlier years in this movement and wondered if I was assertive enough, if I asked all the questions that I needed to, did I study our movement hard enough.\n\n\n\n\u201cNow when I speak at forums, and attendees ask me what I think the role of black America was in the drug war, I reply, \u2018Yes, we wanted some of us to be locked up, but we also wanted treatment and we never got that part,\u2019\u201d she adds.\n\n\n\nTroubled History\n\nAs previously reported by The Root, when Bill Clinton\u2019s crime bill passed in 1994, it was with the help of 23 members of the Congressional Black Caucus who were expecting a reinvestment in the black community.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to that never happening, the bill was stripped of the Racial Justice Act, which would have allowed death row inmates to use data showing racial inequities in sentencing. The bill was also stripped of $3.3 billion\u2014two-thirds of it from prevention programs. A provision that would have made 16,000 low-level drug offenders eligible for early release was also removed.\n\n\u201cThey urinated on us and told us it was raining,\u201d Frederique says. \u201cBut I am not as gracious with our leaders of the past; Charlie Rangel\u2019s apology in [Ava DuVernay\u2019s documentary] 13th is not enough.\n\n\u201cWe threw away whole parts of our community, and we need to examine that as well, because that is our history. It just isn\u2019t all of it, and there is power in telling the full story,\u201d Frederique continues.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrederique also notes that it\u2019s important to recognize that drug-policy reform is not an industry of white saviors. It is so easy to believe otherwise, only because black pioneers have largely been erased from the conversation.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor the most part, we are meant to believe that benevolent white folks are how we got to where we are at now in our war against the war on drugs,\u201d she tells The Root.\n\n\n\n\u201cYes, there are tons of brave white drug-policy reformers who forged paths for the drug war to end, like Ethan Nadelmann, Craig Reinarman and Ira Glasser, but they all read Troy Duster\u2019s book,\u201d Frederique continues. \u201cBeny Primm mentored Deborah Peterson Small. There was and is a resistance that has always been black.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBlack people have been the most severely impacted by the war on drugs,\u201d Frederique adds. \u201cAnd in this moment when white faces have caused the nation to have a critical interrogation about what to do about drugs, black people need the whole story so, in the moment, that we can demand the necessary acknowledgment, atonement and action to build our communities.\u201d\n\n\n\nDrug policy is race policy. And to honor drug-policy reformers on the front lines, the Drug Policy Alliance, in partnership with The Root, is bringing you the stories of four phenomenal people who have been instrumental in shaping conversations around drug policy and its lethal effects on black communities around the country.\n\n\n\nWe begin next week with Wanda James, CEO of the Denver-based cannabis dispensary Simply Pure. James, the first black woman to own a cannabis dispensary, says that it\u2019s time for black America not only to look at the economic opportunities that the cannabis industry represents but also to do the necessary work of eradicating the stigma surrounding drug use: \u201cAll of the people that come to the dispensaries and all of the lawyers and all of the doctors and all of the elected officials that pretend like they don\u2019t know what weed is and they don\u2019t smoke cannabis need to come to the table and get real.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet\u2019s get real.", "keywords": ["narratives", "kassandra", "history", "white", "month", "drugpolicy", "series", "war", "talks", "frederique", "drug", "drugs", "visionary", "root", "owning", "black", "policy"], "polarity": 0.04329440400868974, "subjectivity": 0.4161604268747125},

Leveraging their popular podcast into TV stardom, \u201cthe Bodega Boys\u201d riff on popular culture, politics and (mostly) white people. They\u2019ve become the popular destination for the coolest guests because their show is basically The Daily Show if Trevor Noah were a pair of weed-smoking, 40-ounce-drinking dudes from the Bronx, N.Y..\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Bodega Boys\u2019 beef with DJ Envy began when text messages surfaced of DJ Envy (who is married) chatting with someone who suggested butt play with the Power 105.1 FM host. As usual, Desus and Mero became the hood version of CNN, exposing the story:\n\nThe dispute continued when DJ Envy appeared on an episode of The Real with his wife, seemingly trying to contain the damage. The couple was very honest about the radio host\u2019s past indiscretions, making it appear that they had fixed all of their problems. Desus and Mero, who never shy away from controversy, made fun of the appearance by Envy and his wife because ... well, that\u2019s what they do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, on Thursday morning, Desus and Mero appeared on The Breakfast Club. Envy was in his feelings from the time the men walked in, and there was nothing wrong with that except the men didn\u2019t realize there was a beef.\n\n\n\nAfter introducing his guests as \u201cDickhead\u201d and \u201cPussy,\u201d which is mad passive-aggressive and totally light-skinned, Envy began to explain the impetus behind his beige rage. (Oh, did I mention that Envy was sporting a \u201cMy God vs. My Enemies\u201d hat, which was totally planned because isn\u2019t it just like a light-skinned man to wear passive-aggressive clothing to a fuss fight?)\n\n\u201cYou owe my wife an apology,\u201d Envy said to a baffled Desus and Mero. \u201cWhen you insinuated that she was there for the check.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen DJ Envy played the clip in which Desus and Mero totally insinuated that Envy\u2019s wife was sticking around for the check. Envy wasn\u2019t going full light-skinned for being mad about that. It was a low blow for the talk show guests to take shots at Envy\u2019s wife. Envy explained that wives and children were off-limits, and the guests agreed and apologized.\n\nWhere Envy drove his Jeep Grand Cherokee off the road (yes, Jeep Grand Cherokees are the preferred cars of light-skinned men; just ask any Kappa) was when he couldn\u2019t let it go. He literally stewed in his anger like a spoiled child unable to accept that he\u2019d actually gotten his way. Not sure if Envy came into work looking for a fight, but what he found was an apology, and that wasn\u2019t good enough.\n\nEnvy proceeded to hard-chew his gum (totally light-skinned and passive-aggressive), and make snide remarks before he went full Sinbad and walked off the show, undoing all of Matt Barnes\u2019 good work to dispel the myth that light-skinned men will walk off the air.\n\nAt that point, if Envy was still upset, he should\u2019ve reached across the table and taken a swing at Desus (because Mero is heavier; Dominican\u2014which means there is a 62 percent chance he had a razor under his tongue; and because I\u2019m not here for light-skinned-on-light-skinned crime).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know, because that is what rapper Casanova 2x would\u2019ve done. He is my spiritual guide whenever I\u2019m trying to sort out whether or not I\u2019m inside my light-skinned bag. I can\u2019t see Casanova 2x pushing the microphone away and storming out of the interview after receiving an apology, if for no other reason than he made this song and you can\u2019t get passive-aggressive after rhyming that you would punch someone\u2019s teeth out.\n\nMy sources tell me that Envy walked off the air and into his office, where he took a few swings at the air and then curled up on the floor in the fetal position and had a good cry, and it was well-earned. (And by \u201csources,\u201d I mean my imagination, which is definitely a source.)\n\nEnvy wasn\u2019t wrong for sticking up for his wife\u2019s honor. That\u2019s the commendable part of what he did. Hell, owning up to his cheating on national radio and national television is a real look at grown-man shit. But come on, bruh, Vin Diesel didn\u2019t threaten to beat up Dwayne \u201cthe Rock\u201d Johnson in real life for you to match your hat to your emotions.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is only one way that Envy can undo this: He\u2019s going to have fight Charlamagne tha God in a caged death match or admit on air that he went full light-skinned and then apologize to his guests.\n\nOr, maybe, to redeem his credentials and escape the official censure at the next meeting of #TeamLightSkinned, he can go on Desus and Mero\u2019s show as a guest and fight them both.\n\nWatch out for the razor, though.", "keywords": ["men", "dj", "envy", "wife", "real", "history", "passiveaggressive", "walkoff", "desus", "radio", "envys", "mero", "moment", "tantrum", "lightskinned", "totally"], "polarity": 0.09482704402515722, "subjectivity": 0.5569444444444446},

With styles starting at $4.99, Kiss has always been my cheap date that looks like a million bucks when I take them out on the town!\n\nThen, Tuesday night, at a very cute event thrown by Kiss in a New York penthouse in Manhattan overlooking the Hudson River, I met the newest additions to the Kiss family of false eyelashes\u2014and I got a \u201clash-over.\u201d\n\nCourtesy of KissUsa.com Courtesy of KissUsa.com Courtesy of KissUsa.com 1 / 3\n\nI\u2019ve been craving a lash with heavy winged-out corners that looks natural. \u201cLavish,\u201d from Kiss\u2019s new 5th Avenue Collection, is made of silk fibers, carefully crisscrossed in a natural pattern and tapered at the ends, perfectly mimicking a natural lash.

I\u2019ve had the pleasure of knowing Cynthia since she came to New York to become a fashion model\u2014let alone a businesswoman and reality-TV star turning heads weekly on The Real Housewives of Atlanta. So she was a natural choice as our inaugural Glow Up Goddess.\n\nNow in her seventh season with the hit show that rightfully returned her to the spotlight, Cynthia\u2019s got a lot to celebrate: After a well-publicized divorce, she has a new home and a rumored new man in her life; and in addition to her thriving modeling empire, her name graces multiple product lines that are catching fire\u2014literally. And recently, Cynthia reached a major milestone: turning 50 years old while looking fresher than ever.\n\nNow, in my new role as editor of The Glow Up, I had the opportunity to catch up with my friend and fellow modeling phenom to talk about ageless beauty, second acts and how she makes 50 look so fly.\n\n\n\nThe Glow Up: Happy belated 50th!\n\nCynthia Bailey: I\u2019m celebrating all year\u2014my tagline is \u201c50 Cynt,\u201d and I dressed as 50 Cent for my birthday.

So let\u2019s talk about your kick-ass beauty routine. At The Glow Up we say, \u201cWe gloss, we floss, we boss.\u201d Tell us about your gloss; how do you get your glow up?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCB: People say \u201cBlack don\u2019t crack\u201d; I say it will take a lot longer to crack, but eventually it will crack. I do something every day to make sure that my glow up stays glowing. I get a little Botox in my forehead area and in between my eyebrows; laser facials and filler under my eyes every four months. It\u2019s all about not overdoing it. When I\u2019m not working, I do not wear makeup. I put on heavy moisturizer, wear my natural hair up in a bun and throw on some big Cynthia Bailey sunglasses.\n\nTGU: When was the first moment you knew you were beautiful?\n\nCB: The moment that I did not require validation, approval or acceptance from anyone else was when I began to feel my most beautiful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: Do you have any rules when it comes to beauty?\n\nCB: The only rule I have is my beauty has to represent me, feel like me and look like me.\n\nTGU: What do you wish your younger self had known about beauty?\n\nCB: When it comes to makeup, I wish I would have known that less is more, and it\u2019s never too early to start a good skin-care regimen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: What are your favorite new products?\n\nCB: The older I get, the better I take care of my skin. I use an organic virgin coconut oil from head to toe\u2014I use it in my hair, all over my body to moisturize and drink it in my tea. I use [home acid peels like] Melanopeel Indulgence Eye Cr\u00e8me and Melanopeel Epi Firm.\n\nTGU: What\u2019s your best hair hack?\n\n\n\nCB: Step your wig game up! It\u2019s just healthier for my hair at night; I can take my wig off and take care of my own natural hair. I can be the glam girl and then go to the gym without my lace-front wig on and be comfortable. You can do different colors, textures or styles very easily without actually damaging your own hair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: Now that you\u2019re single and dating, what\u2019s the most exciting part of your beauty ritual?\n\nCB: At this point in my life, I\u2019m excited about embracing my natural beauty. I only wear glamorous makeup when I am working, filming, at events or on the red carpet. As a single, dating woman, I think it is important for the men in my life to appreciate my natural beauty just as much as my glammed-up beauty. I personally feel more beautiful without makeup, weaves, wigs and over-the-top styling.\n\nTGU: How does your idea of beauty mature with you?\n\nCB: The older I get, the better I take care of my skin. Skin care becomes even more important as you age. I use anti-aging creams to help minimize dark circles, fine lines and wrinkles. I get minimal fillers and Botox two to three times a year as needed to help keep me looking younger and refreshed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: You\u2019ve said that when modeling became limited, you had to \u201cboss up\u201d and make your own lane, and you\u2019ve certainly done that. Tell us how you did it.\n\nCB: I am a beauty and a fashion brand. At the end of the day, the only other thing I\u2019ve ever done\u2014other than be a (Real) Housewife\u2014is be a fashion model since I was 18 years old. That\u2019s where I am an expert. I paid attention to career direction, hair, makeup, photography, lighting, clothing and fashion. I had a hugely successful modeling career, but I always knew that at some point, it was going to end.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: Is it a big transition to go from working for other people to becoming a CEO?\n\n\n\nCB: It is a big transition. There was a void in the field that the Bailey Agency filled. Because of my history, people from all over the world [who want to be models] know that I\u2019m giving them the right information on how to legitimately get into the fashion business. They know they can trust me.\n\nTGU: Did you have any reservations that you might not be taken seriously as a businesswoman or as a CEO?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCB: In terms of fear, at this point in my life, I just have a \u201cgo for it\u201d mentality. I don\u2019t do risky businesses. I stay in my lane, where I know I will have success.\n\nTGU: What about failure?\n\n\n\nCB: You can\u2019t be afraid to fail, because every new vision of yours is not always going to work. Every new business is like a child. If I don\u2019t feed that child, it\u2019s going to die. I want all my babies to flourish. It takes a business at least a couple of years to see any real profit. People fail because they take on too much.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: Where do you see your businesses going ? Are you the Martha Stewart of \u201cLake Bailey\u201d\u2014as you call your home in ATL?\n\nCB: I love that idea! I see myself as a lifestyle brand that stands for quality and affordability. I see my products living very well on home-shopping networks; that\u2019s a very relevant audience that spends a lot of money. I love celebrating, but I\u2019m never going to be the girl you see on Real Housewives of Atlanta just talking about excessive labels. I\u2019m all about personal style, and how you put it all together.\n\nTGU: But you do always look so put together, and there\u2019s no shame in a little flossing, is there? Tell us why it\u2019s important to give yourself permission to treat yourself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCB: Because I am a woman first and foremost. As a businesswoman, I want to be be able to live a life of luxury. It\u2019s not all about just work, work, work. I still want to look and feel good, and beautiful things make me feel good. You know, I don\u2019t think any woman doesn\u2019t want nice things. It\u2019s a bonus.\n\nTGU: On that note, I know you\u2019ve got business to attend to, so I\u2019ll let you fly ... but thanks for speaking on the next phase. As I\u2019m starting a new phase myself, I completely identify with that.\n\nCB: You\u2019re doing great, Veronica.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Real Housewives of Atlanta airs Sundays at 8 p.m. ET/PT on Bravo.\n\n\n\nThe Glow Up gift tip: Cynthia Bailey Candles are made with soy-based wax and are available in 10 gorgeous fragrances.

Right Now,\u201d a piece in The Washingtonian magazine that\u2019s become all the talk in Washington circles this week. Or at least some Washington circles.\n\nConservatives (mostly men) in the article lament that D.C. liberals would rather swipe left than settle in for a night of Tucker Carlson and chill. The dating deficit isn\u2019t just affecting the men, though. Conservative women who\u2019ve swarmed D.C. since Donald Trump got into office are forced to alter their dating choices, too. From The Washingtonian:\n\n\n\nConversely, a young White House staffer says she typically looks for someone from the South when swiping through profiles, as she thinks they\u2019ll be more receptive to her support of the President.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: She\u2019s looking for a white guy from the South. I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s not on BlackSinglesMeet.com scrolling for alumni from FAMU. Which got me thinking: Are black conservatives having the same dating problems as white conservatives in D.C.? Is there some lonely black Republican guy out there wondering why Lisa, Angela, Pamela and Renee never responded to his Diamond and Silk Chit Chat Live Evite? Is there some black Republican woman out there trying to turn men\u2019s heads who\u2019s frustrated because everyone thinks her \u201cLock Her Up\u201d T-shirt is advertising a new spot on 14th Street to get their braids done? I took an unofficial survey of every black Republican I know to get to the bottom of this mystery.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nObviously, this polling has some limitations\u2014most of the black Republicans I know are already married, and it was hard finding LGBT black Republicans. I know a few, but to this day, I have yet to meet a black lesbian Republican. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re out there, riding unicorns and paying for Janelle Mon\u00e1e tickets with four-leaf clovers dipped in vibranium, but I couldn\u2019t find any before deadline.\n\nThe vast majority of people I spoke to said that being a conservative or a Republican didn\u2019t hurt their D.C. dating prospects at all. If anything, it may have helped. The people I spoke to agreed to share their stories on the condition that their identities be kept secret. So The Root promised to be one of the few outlets in D.C. that WON\u2019T leak Republican testimony.\n\n\u201cMy boys introduce me as \u2018That\u2019s my Republican friend,\u2019 and women are, like, intrigued,\u201d said one prominent GOP state party member in his late 40s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI know Republicans who get play, and I know some that are wack,\u201d said a Gen X Republican married to a woman who worked on former President Barack Obama\u2019s campaign. \u201cI mean, most folks don\u2019t bang with 45 like that, so if that\u2019s how you start and end every conversation, what do you expect?\u201d\n\nThe emerging theme was that being a black Republican wasn\u2019t as big a problem so long as:\n\nYou focused on the black part.\n\nYou weren\u2019t a Trump-supporting black person.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never been a problem for me,\u201d a millennial black Republican who works in media said. \u201cI mean, my girlfriend knows I\u2019m a black man. She knows that the lens through which I live my conservative politics is as a black man. Besides, her momma said, \u2018As long as he isn\u2019t one of those TRUMP conservatives,\u2019 and I definitely am not!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve dated lots of men I don\u2019t agree with,\u201d said a 40-something black woman who works as a newspaper editor. \u201cBut Trump supporters are assholes!\u201d She noted that a co-worker set her up with a Trumper about a year ago.\n\n\u201cHe was very handsome, successful, but so arrogant,\u201d she said. \u201cHe went on and on about how journalists should be locked up and how immigrants are ruining America.\u201d Clearly lapsing into the worst date of her life, \u201cAnd you know the worst part? He was a Jamaican immigrant!\u201d\n\nA lot of what I was hearing spoke to the way that black folks navigate \u201cparty\u201d politics versus universal issues when it comes to dating and mating. For many, being a Republican is like a form of code-switching, and potential dates accept that, but \u201cTrumpism\u201d is a lifestyle choice that will get you no love. I swear on a stack of secondhand copies of Gifted Hands that most black men and women in Washington would go on a date with a small-government, lower-taxes, pro-life potential bae, and even listen to some shading of Obama, but there are limits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI went on a few dates with a black Republican soon after I moved to D.C. Everything was cool until we started talking about Black Lives Matter and she turned into Stacey Dash. Not the \u201cAll Falls Down\u201d Stacey Dash, but Fox News, \u201cWe should cancel Black History Month and I hate BET even though I used to twerk in their videos,\u201d hypocritical Stacey Dash.\n\nI think this woman found political debates to be sexy, but by the time she was explaining why black folks shouldn\u2019t be given access to police dashcam and bodycam video because we\u2019d \u201cjust go crazy and riot,\u201d it was a wrap. I wanted to just give her a prepaid Metro card back to the sunken place, but I was too much of a gentleman; and besides, she probably would have liked it.\n\nMy extensive survey and lab work could only lead to one conclusion: Conservative white, Trump-loving people must suck at dating in D.C., because black conservatives aren\u2019t having these problems. Also, this isn\u2019t just a Trump issue; Breitbart complained about the same thing during the Obama administration, and Tomi Lahren\u2019s living Dorian Gray painting, Ann Coulter, said the same thing under Bush.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo why a whole article about it? What would compel a few \u201cMAGA\u201d-hat-wearing men and women to whine to The Washingtonian that their weekends are as empty as a Trump Christmas party?\n\n\u201cThat was just some \u2018woe is me\u2019 white-boy stuff right there,\u201d said the GOP state official. \u201cThey think they\u2019re entitled, but look, you enabled this guy [Trump]; you\u2019re complicit in what this country is going through. Why should anybody throw you the box?\u201d\n\nNever fear, though, young white conservatives. There are still some options for the less-than-discerning, Trump-supporting D.C. dater. Just know that the first 20 minutes might cost you about $130,000, but you definitely won\u2019t be judged for riding the Trump train.", "keywords": ["men", "republican", "know", "trump", "women", "white", "dating", "tucker", "ones", "doing", "chill", "dc", "carlson", "date", "black", "fine", "conservatives"], "polarity": -0.026833694083694067, "subjectivity": 0.4630097402597401},

Solange did the absolute most, impressing us with African-inspired avant-garde hairstyles. Then there was Erykah Badu\u2014aka \u201cSara Bellum,\u201d aka \u201cFat Belly Bella,\u201d aka \u201cMedulla Oblongata,\u201d aka \u201cLow Down Loretta Brown,\u201d aka \u201cAnalogue Girl in a Digital World\u201d\u2014who pushed all the way through in what she called \u201catomic micro cosmic Badu braids.\u201d\n\nAnd just when we thought this summer\u2019s cornrow craze had calmed down, Nicki Minaj came through and put it on us with \u201cPink Lemonade,\u201d a fully remixed version of Queen Bey\u2019s \u201cLemonade\u201d braids. As per usual, black hair is out here being great.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t always the case. Like any initiative, it takes time and momentum to gain traction. When enough people get on board, it becomes a runaway train\u2014a movement.\n\nNatural hair isn\u2019t new; it was promoted during the Black Power and Black Arts movements of the late \u201960s and \u201970s, when African Americans were encouraged to celebrate black aesthetics and pride. These ideas were realized through hairstyles like the Afro, braids and dreadlocks. However, as the movements fizzled, the exaltation of naturally textured hair did, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA resurgence\u2014that I refer to as \u201cthe first wave\u201d\u2014occurred in the 1990s as black representation became more visible in mainstream culture. Simultaneously, black women began to embrace natural hairstyles\u2014braids and twists in particular. Ethnic hairdos like box braids, cornrows and twists, once reserved for leisure and younger women, moved into professional spaces and even into entertainment.\n\nThursday nights were spent watching Living Single and fawning over Erika Alexander\u2019s fabulous bobbed nu-locs. And let\u2019s not forget Brandy Norwood\u2019s role as Moesha, the sassy braided teen. Their attention-grabbing hairdos boosted braiding salon services and marked a new era in black aesthetics called the natural-hair movement.\n\nCelebrity stylist Debra Hare-Bey of Debra Hare-bey Private Parlor @ OMHH (Oh My Heavenly Hair) Beauty Oasis in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn, N.Y., says that much like in the \u201960s and \u201970s, the catalyst for the natural-hair boom in the \u201990s was due to \u201ca feeling of pride from the inside that began to reflect on the outside.\u201d\n\nMoving into the new millennium, a shift occurred. Concepts of natural hair were not solely about being in vogue, but also about a lifestyle. As black women adopted more holistic approaches to living healthy, hair also became a consideration. Women resorted to the big chop, shirking chemical relaxers for their own healthy textured manes, and changed the landscape of black hair. The twist-out and \u2019fros were reborn, locs were more plentiful and protective hairstyles grew.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccordingly, traditional hair-product lines were forced to recognize and respond to a rapidly growing market and new demographic that was previously ignored: \u201cBlack women immobilized an entire beauty industry to pay attention to their hair needs. Hair-care products, books and videos are now available in the general market. Target, Walmart [and] Sally\u2019s all carry merchandise and product for natural hair. It makes me proud,\u201d says Diane C. Bailey, expert stylist and author of Milady Standard Natural Hair Care & Braiding.\n\nForward-thinking entrepreneurs and stylists began accommodating these new naturalistas in committing to their kinky tresses by expanding natural-hair services and designing hair-care products that catered to the complexities of black hair. Innovators in that market were Jane Carter Solutions, Miss Jessie\u2019s and, more recently, SheaMoisture.\n\nAs more women embraced the coils they were born with, the movement evolved yet again. This go-round, women took education and style into their own hands by learning texture and techniques and exploring creativity. Trial and error and black women\u2019s agency and ingenuity resulted in the creation of a show-and-tell culture on YouTube and other social media. Many women transitioned from bathroom stylists into natural-hair gurus by sharing product reviews, how-tos and DIY tutorials.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese women created economic lanes for themselves while educating and empowering others who were at the start of their natural-hair journeys. These women are the new voice of the movement and the progenitors of new techniques and style. For example, Susy Oludele, professionally known as \u201cAfrican Creature,\u201d is the masterful hair artist behind Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cLemonade\u201d braids. She developed her YouTube and instagram presence around her styling prowess, and has parlayed her colorful hair artistry into a successful business.\n\nAs natural hair evolves, we continue to see self-expression that pushes the envelope: bold hues, enchanting adornment, even shaved heads.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a once quiet movement, women have discovered and liberated their true selves. Through hair\u2014or a lack thereof\u2014we black women are asserting our identity. Bald beauty and clothing designer Sarah Nicole Fran\u00e7ois feels that much of what people decide about black women is attached to hair. She says that being bald, though it comes with its own presumptions, freed her from a lot of that.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like, y\u2019all wanna use my hair to decide what kind of black person you think I am? Well now, I don\u2019t have any. So what\u2019s up?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack hair has a history of being politicized. However, the natural-hair movement has snatched those roots and redefined the black aesthetic for black women and popular culture. Natural hair has given women agency and voice when it comes to our identity and freedom of expression. It is no longer a movement, it is mainstay.

As I am one of the world\u2019s leading scholars on the subject, Wypipology: The Essential Guide to Understanding White People, will be a semiserious satire dissecting my life\u2019s work in the uncharted field of Wypipology. I have no idea who, if anyone, will read it. I just think it\u2019s a funny idea that can also unveil some truth under the guise of comedy.\n\nOn Friday, comedian, actress and world-renowned owner of an unnecessary apostrophe, Mo\u2019Nique, appeared on The Breakfast Club to confront Charlamagne tha God for naming her the \u201cDonkey of the Day\u201d in January after Mo\u2019Nique called for Netflix to be placed somewhere between H&M and R. Kelly\u2019s music on the list of things black people say they\u2019re boycotting but still support on the down low (because, as the great pedophile purveyor of pee-pee once sang: \u201cNobody has to knoooow\u201d).\n\nMo\u2019 evoked her age, her award r\u00e9sum\u00e9, her status as a legend, the history of black women and even the civil rights struggle in her well-laid-out argument on why she considered CandyCorn Face tha God\u2019s use of \u201cdonkey\u201d disrespectful. She, unfortunately, dismantled her logic-based assertions every time she publicly referred to her husband-manager (who was on the phone) as \u201cDaddy.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCharlamagne tha Lawd listened intently and presented his own reasons for why he felt she deserved to be called a \u201cdonkey\u201d for overvaluing her worth as a celebrity and boycott kickstarter. The entire exchange was compelling, and both sides came away from it looking simultaneously petulant and convincing in the disagreement.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing. Maybe they were both right.\n\nCharlamagne talks on the radio for a living. Besides providing a platform for Negro-hating white women, and calibrating his disdain for black women based on the amount of melanin in their skin (to be fair, long before he dismissed Amara La Negra\u2019s colorism claims, Charlamagne tha Goddamn Fool explained that \u201cwhite girls are poppin\u2019 right now\u201d), his primary job is as a shade thrower and shit starter. He does it well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo his credit, Charlie was willing to face his critics, and anything he said in their absence, he will say in their presence\u2014most famously to Birdman, who forever blessed us with a never-expiring meme when the Cash Money millionaire implored Charlamagne tha Bomb Pop face to \u201cput some respeck\u201d on his name.\n\nRegardless of my feelings about Charlamagne, some people respeck him for that. In his hometown of Moncks Corner, S.C. (the home of my mother), that is the law. You can say anything about anyone, as long as you are willing to say it to their face. He tried to explain why he called Mo\u2019Nique a donkey while she was present.\n\nAnd even though Charlamagne tha Messiah is often problematic, he didn\u2019t run. Like Erik Killmonger and people who can\u2019t stop themselves from dancing to the remix to \u201cIgnition,\u201d he handled it the wrong way, which she told him in private, after the mics were off:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever you feel about Mo\u2019Nique, it is impossible to deny her credentials. She is one of the few black female comedians to have ever entered the stratosphere of the top echelon of joke tellers\u2014black or white. Lest we forget, she has a little thing I like to call an \u201cAcademy Award.\u201d\n\n\n\nHer dispute with Netflix aside, one cannot reach the levels of success that she has achieved without talent and hard work. Her unwillingness to accept an offer that she feels devalues her as a performer and a human being shouldn\u2019t be dismissed in the equation. Whether or not anyone else feels she has overestimated her value is inconsequential.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI wish I had Mo\u2019Nique\u2019s level of confidence and self-value. The idea that others cannot determine the value of your work is an important lesson. Maybe she should treat people better. Maybe she isn\u2019t as funny or as popular as she and her \u201cDaddy\u201d believes (I feel like I should put my name on the sex offender\u2019s registry every time I type that), but her willingness to say \u201cFuck your couch\u201d and stand on principle is admirable.\n\nMo\u2019Nique is right. Black is often devalued because it is black. Women are often lowballed because they are women. It is difficult to live in that reality and reject it as a reason that she believes Netflix undervalued her. Even if she is wrong about Netflix, her larger point is also correct.\n\nTalent and ability mean a little less when you are black and belligerent in a Caucasian industry. Despite the fact that Ben Shapiro, Dinesh D\u2019Souza and even Milo Yiannopoulos had lucrative book deals, I\u2019m sure there won\u2019t be a bidding war for a satirical tome about white people. The probable lack of interest from publishers won\u2019t be based on numbers, analytics or a r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany of them will probably be apprehensive because, like Mo\u2019Nique and Charlamagne, I have a history of publicly pissing off white people. And I, like them, wholeheartedly believe everything I say is entertaining, honest and\u2014most important\u2014correct. But it will probably cost me. I\u2019m fine with that.\n\nI guess what I\u2019m trying to say is this:\n\nHey, my loves,\n\nBecause of discrimination and bias, I\u2019m calling for us to come together as a people and stand with me in this boycott against all books and everything white, including Apple chargers, Q-Tips and granulated sugar, until a publisher presents me with a check for $10 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI love us, for real.", "keywords": ["calling", "charlamagne", "tha", "netflix", "wrong", "spoiler", "white", "say", "women", "face", "alert", "answer", "im", "black", "donkey", "monique"], "polarity": 0.06354760006075795, "subjectivity": 0.4925099206349207},

As usual, Desus and Mero became the hood version of CNN, exposing the story:\n\nThe dispute continued when DJ Envy appeared on an episode of The Real with his wife, seemingly trying to contain the damage. The couple was very honest about the radio host\u2019s past indiscretions, making it appear that they had fixed all of their problems. Desus and Mero, who never shy away from controversy, made fun of the appearance by Envy and his wife because ... well, that\u2019s what they do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, on Thursday morning, Desus and Mero appeared on The Breakfast Club. Envy was in his feelings from the time the men walked in, and there was nothing wrong with that except the men didn\u2019t realize there was a beef.\n\n\n\nAfter introducing his guests as \u201cDickhead\u201d and \u201cPussy,\u201d which is mad passive-aggressive and totally light-skinned, Envy began to explain the impetus behind his beige rage. (Oh, did I mention that Envy was sporting a \u201cMy God vs. My Enemies\u201d hat, which was totally planned because isn\u2019t it just like a light-skinned man to wear passive-aggressive clothing to a fuss fight?)\n\n\u201cYou owe my wife an apology,\u201d Envy said to a baffled Desus and Mero. \u201cWhen you insinuated that she was there for the check.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen DJ Envy played the clip in which Desus and Mero totally insinuated that Envy\u2019s wife was sticking around for the check. Envy wasn\u2019t going full light-skinned for being mad about that. It was a low blow for the talk show guests to take shots at Envy\u2019s wife. Envy explained that wives and children were off-limits, and the guests agreed and apologized.\n\nWhere Envy drove his Jeep Grand Cherokee off the road (yes, Jeep Grand Cherokees are the preferred cars of light-skinned men; just ask any Kappa) was when he couldn\u2019t let it go. He literally stewed in his anger like a spoiled child unable to accept that he\u2019d actually gotten his way. Not sure if Envy came into work looking for a fight, but what he found was an apology, and that wasn\u2019t good enough.\n\nEnvy proceeded to hard-chew his gum (totally light-skinned and passive-aggressive), and make snide remarks before he went full Sinbad and walked off the show, undoing all of Matt Barnes\u2019 good work to dispel the myth that light-skinned men will walk off the air.\n\nAt that point, if Envy was still upset, he should\u2019ve reached across the table and taken a swing at Desus (because Mero is heavier; Dominican\u2014which means there is a 62 percent chance he had a razor under his tongue; and because I\u2019m not here for light-skinned-on-light-skinned crime).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know, because that is what rapper Casanova 2x would\u2019ve done. He is my spiritual guide whenever I\u2019m trying to sort out whether or not I\u2019m inside my light-skinned bag. I can\u2019t see Casanova 2x pushing the microphone away and storming out of the interview after receiving an apology, if for no other reason than he made this song and you can\u2019t get passive-aggressive after rhyming that you would punch someone\u2019s teeth out.\n\nMy sources tell me that Envy walked off the air and into his office, where he took a few swings at the air and then curled up on the floor in the fetal position and had a good cry, and it was well-earned. (And by \u201csources,\u201d I mean my imagination, which is definitely a source.)\n\nEnvy wasn\u2019t wrong for sticking up for his wife\u2019s honor.

From twinkling eye shadows to top facial treatments, here are my top five recommended treats that will make someone you love feel like a star when she finds them under the tree!\n\n1. Eye Shadow Palettes\n\nWhen it comes to dazzling color that\u2019s easy to wear for the holiday season, the eyes have it. Personally, I love long-wearing shades and a lot of variety\u2014it adds up to a lot of options at a nice price. This is a cute video on how to use one of my favorite palettes from ColourPop, available for $30.\n\n2. Serum\n\nEveryone loves a serum\u2014or they should\u2014because those precious elixirs slide into your skin\u2019s thirsty pores like a saving grace. In fact, if you haven\u2019t already, try this beauty hack: Mix in a serum to customize any brand of liquid or cream foundation. Not only does it make controlling the application easier by blending together the foundation\u2019s suspension base of water, oil or silicone and pigment more throughly than just shaking the bottle, but it also turns your makeup into a treatment for your face.\n\nMy latest fave is SkinCeuticals B5 Serum ($82). Oil-free formulas are your best bet when it comes to making sure your foundation doesn\u2019t jailbreak itself from the serum in a mere few hours, since oil-based and water-based products don\u2019t mix. You ever notice makeup that looks like it\u2019s separating or melting? That\u2019s why. This gel formula nourishes with hyaluronic acid, which is the body\u2019s natural defense against dehydration.\n\n3. Night Cream\n\nWhen I turn the lights out at night, I say, \u201cMake it rain!\u201d I\u2019m a believer in slathering on night cream and waking up looking like a daisy. Knowing what kind of skin you have\u2014oily, dry, normal or combo\u2014dictates what you need to feed your face. Dr. Shirley Madhere, a New York City-based holistic plastic surgeon, advises that nighttime is the \u201coptimal moment for the skin to regenerate.\u201d In her opinion, there are three primary modes of regeneration, and these are the corresponding ingredients that maximize results:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRepair with antioxidants: I like Herbivore\u2019s Moon Fruit Superfruit Night Treatment ($58).\n\nProtect with refined essential oils, like those found in Acure Organics Seriously Glowing Facial Serum ($19.99).\n\nHydrate: Hyaluronic acid-based moisturizers work to rehydrate the skin on a cellular level, restoring plumpness and luminosity, like Tata Harper\u2019s Illuminating Moisturizer ($105). This organic product has diamond dust in it and can be mixed into foundation for more radiance, or layered on top for strobing. Or bring out the RiRi in you, and shine bright like a diamond even when you wear it to bed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Face Masks\n\nOnce a week, take it all off. Winter weather and holiday parties kill your skin. Between the layers of dry skin building up from freezing temperatures outside and dry heat inside and the harsh effects of holiday cocktails and lipid-zapping party food, your pores are like microscopic firehoses trying to shoot out toxins as fast as they can.\n\nBottoms up! Sheet masks are a great way to get your drink on for thirsty skin in need of tightening, plumping or hydrating. Dr. Jart\u2019s Rubber Mask series\u2014besides it\u2019s totally intriguing packaging\u2014is not as Westworld as it looks. The combination of slippery red algae and calcium is cold to the touch and feels super sleek and sexy on the skin. And at $12 per mask, there\u2019s something for everyone!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to the very affordable Dr. Jart masks above, Dr. Michelle Henry, a Harvard-trained dermatologist and plastic surgeon, shared her list of favorite masks: SK-II Facial Treatment masks ($95-$135) and Sisley Black Rose Mask ($89) are her top picks for hydration during long-haul flights, and Cle de Peau\u2019s Intensive Brightening Mask helps fight hyperpigmentation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. Facial Devices\n\nGet lifted! I can tell you firsthand that micro-current technology works to tighten and lift your skin. I\u2019ve paid fortunes for micro-current treatments at corner nail salons and five-star spas alike, because they work. When these handheld devices came to the market for home use four years ago, I was first in line, and I still use mine weekly to tighten and lift my face and neck and smooth my forehead.\n\nThe mild electric current that passes through the silver orbs, conducted though a layer of ultrasound jelly (or even aloe vera, if you\u2019re on a budget), is like an elliptical machine for facial muscles. The current can sting slightly\u2014especially where skin tends to be thinner around the brow bone and under the eyes, while there\u2019s almost no sensation on the cheeks, neck and jawline. But a little discomfort is worth it in the under-eye area, where micro-currents do wonders to get rid of dark circles and puffiness in minutes by increasing circulation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe devices, which are cordless and FDA approved, range in price from to $20 to $200, meaning that everyone can afford to get in the game.

If we haven\u2019t yet met, I\u2019m Veronica Webb, a woman with 30 years of experience in the fashion industry under my proverbial Gucci belt. I\u2019m proud to be known as one of the original supermodels to rule the runway and slay magazine covers, and as the first black model in history to receive a major cosmetics contract in the 1990s. These days, I\u2019m equally proud of my evolution into a beauty writer and fashion blogger.\n\nAt The Glow Up, we eat, breathe and sleep beauty and fashion 24-7. And yet we consider ourselves more than just \u201cbeauty junkies,\u201d because to us, beauty isn\u2019t an addiction\u2014it\u2019s an adventure. We\u2019re beauty explorers, taking you not only inside the fashion and beauty industries (and more) but within diverse bodies, minds, lifestyles and discoveries in the quest to build inner strength as a foundation for external beauty. (Though we\u2019ll have plenty of external beauty here, too.)\n\nFor us, beauty is a ritual of empowerment for women of all ages. Similarly, what we choose to put on our bodies is also a form of strength, because the way we do our hair and makeup and wear our clothes is the shining armor we don every day to go out and conquer the world.\n\nThe truth is, the days of being shamelessly vain are over (unless you have more than 20 million followers on Instagram). Nowadays, true beauty has depth\u2014and a compassionately global, humanitarian perspective. No pressure; but we wouldn\u2019t ask you to be here if we didn\u2019t consider you capable. The truth is, we need you\u2014and your truth.\n\nTiziano Magni for Sophie Theallet Scott Nobles Patrick Demarchelier Keith Major 1 / 4\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust to give you some perspective: On the path to finding and defining my own beauty and style, I couldn\u2019t wait to run off to New York and Paris and join the fashion circus so I could break my oppressive childhood taboos of no red lipstick or blue eye shadow (on black girls, at least), suppressing my natural hair texture, the stifling refrain of \u201cThat doesn\u2019t match\u201d and being admonished to save my \u201cgood clothes\u201d for special occasions. And break free, I did.\n\nLike Godzilla in stilettos, I romped through the world of high fashion, devouring every bit of information about beauty, fashion and lifestyle I could along the way. Eventually it became part of me and my way of walking through the world\u2014in sneakers and stilettos alike. What I learned was that anyone can be beautiful, at any time of life\u2014and sometimes it\u2019s as simple as finding the right dress or hairstyle that sets your confidence free.\n\n\n\nMost important, I know that beauty is more than vanity. I\u2019ve learned a lot from my decades in the beauty rat race because working as a model can be a tooth-and-nail battle, where only the strongest survive (or get plastic surgery and start over\u2014just kidding). And ultimately, I\u2019ve won the battle with myself over who\u2019s the fairest of them all. The prize? Owning the belief that beauty is a form of strength that comes from within ... but you still need to know where to go.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo get out your \u201cgood clothes,\u201d and join us here at The Glow Up, because we believe that LIFE is a special occasion. I\u2019m confident that the voices and stories of the women we feature here will resonate with you, because our mission is not to simply talk about beauty but also to help you live beautifully. We know that what\u2019s in your mind is as important as what\u2019s on your body, so we want to help you resist anything that doesn\u2019t make you stronger, and put into action everything that contributes to your mental, physical and spiritual beauty\u2014because God don\u2019t like ugly, and neither does The Glow Up. So if you\u2019re ready to explore and become the best of the best\u2014get ready to get your \u201cglow up\u201d!\n\nVeronica Webb,\n\nEditor, The Glow Up\n\n\n\nWifey, mommy, supermodel (currently strung out on Starbucks)", "keywords": ["know", "women", "strength", "beauty", "im", "welcome", "fashion", "clothes", "glow", "whats", "way"], "polarity": 0.249534435261708, "subjectivity": 0.5429744195198741},

No, I do not.\u201d\n\nShe then compared neo-Nazis to gang members and felons.\n\n\u201cDo I know every member of a gang, whether they have a good heart or not? No, I don\u2019t. Do I know every man in prison, if he has a good heart or not? No,\u201d she added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBoth sides had a right,\u201d Dash repeated about the Charlottesville neo-Nazis and counterprotesters, \u201cbut there were both extremes.\u201d\n\nMaybe Dash is right.\n\nOn second thought, not wanting a literal parade of tiki-torch-wielding neo-Nazis in your town is a pretty wild stance. And how could you possibly know the heart of someone who says something like, \u201cFor us, it is conquer or die. This is a unique burden for the white man\u201d? (That was Richard Spencer, by the way.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow could you possibly know the inner life of someone who thinks a German dictator who committed mass genocide had a pretty good point? Who are we to judge a man who would rather ram his car into a crowd of people than accept being a minority in this country?\n\nCertainly not Ms. Dash.\n\nThis newfound compassion is quite an about-face for the woman vowing to be a \u201ccatalyst for change\u201d in California\u2019s 44th District. Dash has a long history of serving up her unwanted opinions on her blog and on Fox News, and had no reservations about judging others prior to this interview.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe\u2019s repeatedly spoken out against former President Barack Obama. In 2016, while attending the Conservative Political Action Conference, Dash said that Obama \u201cbamboozled us.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we all got blacked into it, \u201c she said, according to Essence.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t too concerned about knowing Jesse Williams\u2019 heart, either, when she called the actor a \u201cperfect example of a Hollywood plantation slave\u201d in a 2016 blog post after he spoke at the BET Awards.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe fact that you were standing on that stage at THOSE awards tells people you really don\u2019t know what your talking about. Just spewing hate and anger,\u201d Dash said, doling out harsher words to the Grey\u2019s Anatomy actor than she could muster giving to violent white supremacists.\n\nNor did Dash much care what was in the hearts of transgender activists fighting for their right to use the correct bathroom.\n\n\u201cOK, then go in the bushes,\u201d Dash said, also in 2016 (a real landmark year for knowing people\u2019s hearts, I suppose). \u201cI don\u2019t know what to tell you, but I\u2019m not gonna put my child\u2019s life at risk because you want to change a law,\u201d Dash added, bringing up a long-held but completely false belief that trans people pose a danger to children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd Dash couldn\u2019t find a word to mince when blogging about Black Lives Matter. Not only did she feel completely at home mocking one organizer, Aaron Goggans, for saying that black-on-black crime was a myth, but she also delivered a categorical condemnation of BLM\u2014despite not knowing their hearts: \u201cBlack Lives Matter is really a racist [movement] by definition\u2014providing a value based on the color of someones [sic] skin is Racist....

However, with women\u2019s integration into these hallowed halls of haircut technicians comes great responsibility\u2014namely, the acceptance of the statutes and traditions governing the barbershop universe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn behalf of The Glow Up, I decided to go over some of the most important tips, rituals and rules for those who are new to the world of black barbershops.\n\nFinding a Black Barbershop\n\nBlack Barbershops are easily recognizable. If the business has any of the following words in the name, it is a black barbershop: Cutz, Stylez, Nu, Kutz, Fresh, Dope, Fadez, Klip, Kingz, Stylez or You-Nique.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou must be careful, however. The business must also have at least one person outside smoking a Newport (Black & Milds are also acceptable). I once burst through the doors of a place called \u201cKuttin\u2019 It Close,\u201d and the Caucasians inside looked at me like I was lost. I\u2019m still reeling from that experience.\n\nBarbershop Math\n\nOne of the most important things to remember about the black barbershop is the code of conduct. Unlike beauty salons, haircutteries mostly operate on a first-come, first-served basis. More than any other institution, this is not a suggestion, this is the law. Skipping the line or allowing someone to go ahead of you is strictly forbidden.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFurthermore, it is your responsibility to ascertain the order of service as soon as you arrive. The easiest way to achieve this goal is to ask the barber \u201cHow many you got?\u201d as soon as you walk in.\n\nHere is the key: He is going to lie.\n\nBarbers don\u2019t count the person whose head they are currently working on, the one immediately before you or the guy who just went next door to get a plate of wings. It is incumbent on you to do this mathematical calculation yourself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo determine how long your haircut will take, simply multiply the number of customers preceding you by the average number of minutes it takes your hair artist to do each haircut. Then add 2 minutes and 17 seconds for each customer to pay, the secret aerosol chemical they spray on your head that smells like brand-new tires and the 46-second midhaircut soliloquy your barber will perform about why Black Thought is the GOAT or why Rihanna is finer than Beyonc\u00e9.\n\nAlso, when it\u2019s your turn, no one will say anything, and someone will definitely try to cut in front of you. If you aren\u2019t paying attention, the person after you will be in the chair and halfway through their low Caesar before you even realized you missed your spot. This is no one\u2019s fault but your own.\n\nIt\u2019s all mathematics.\n\nChoosing a Barber\n\nEven if you have chosen a barbershop, it is important to choose a barber based on your individual needs. You must factor in the difficulty of your style, how much time you have, the skill of the barber and, most important, the barber\u2019s breath.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso most important, you must know that once you choose a barber, he is your barber for life. You can never go to another barber within a 20-mile radius. Some people choose to have a barber on the side, but I consider that cheating. A few years ago, a barber really messed up a simple beard-trimming. I decided never to use his services again.\n\nSo I had to move across the country. It\u2019s the law. (Editor\u2019s note: This works the same way in beauty-salon culture. You\u2019re in exile.)\n\nThere are usually three kinds of barbers in every barbershop:\n\nThe old head: Often the owner of the barbershop, this guy is adept at Afros, older fades and shape-ups, but if you need a newer style, he might not be the one to choose. He believes that Elgin Baylor was the greatest basketball player of all time, and he is going to ask you if you\u2019re single. Always say no, unless you want to go out with his nephew, who\u2019s a \u201cbig-time lawyer.\u201d Even if you do, still say no. Important: While the old head might seem like the speedy option if you are in a hurry, you must add three minutes to your time calculations for each of his haircuts. It\u2019s not that he\u2019s slow; he just has to pee a lot.\n\n\n\nOften the owner of the barbershop, this guy is adept at Afros, older fades and shape-ups, but if you need a newer style, he might not be the one to choose.

The master barber is one of the most skilled technicians in the world. His shape-ups connect at exact 90-degree right angles. He is a Picasso with a No. 1 blade. However, if your haircut isn\u2019t uniquely difficult, you may want to choose another barber because 83 percent of the people in the shop are waiting for him. And he\u2019s gotta take a break between each haircut to smoke a Black & Mild. How else will people know?\n\n\n\nHad it not been for education inequality and systematic oppression, this guy would have been a heart surgeon.

The new guy: He just got his barber\u2019s license, although he has been cutting hair in dorm rooms, barracks and kitchens for years. He is enthusiastic but a little annoying because he desperately wants to build up his clientele. He cuts the hair of a lot of kids, who are dropped off by their parents. He is going to add you to his email list and ask that you follow him on Instagram. He probably wants to Snapchat your finished haircut, too. Sometimes you might arrive and his chair is empty. Never go to the barber with the empty chair!\n\n\n\nHe just got his barber\u2019s license, although he has been cutting hair in dorm rooms, barracks and kitchens for years.

He makes the most money in the shop because the master barber comes in whenever he wants and the new guy has to pick up his son from day care at 3:15. The other dude has a pleasant attitude and never says much, is fast and won\u2019t mess up your hair. He is the Toyota Corolla of barbers.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKnow the Lingo\n\nJust like I still have no idea what exactly constitutes a \u201cpress and curl\u201d or what a \u201csplit end\u201d is, you\u2019re going to have to learn an entirely new language. If you wondered what I meant earlier when I referred to a \u201clow Caesar,\u201d you should look it up. I don\u2019t actually know where you can find a barbershop glossary, but I\u2019m sure there must be one somewhere. You need to know the difference between an \u201cedge-up\u201d and a \u201cshape-up\u201d and how to describe what you want your finished product to look like.\n\nIt\u2019s akin to ordering off a secret menu at your favorite restaurant. For instance, a \u201cbald fade, no part, just tighten the top, no razor, V in the back, trim the beard but leave it fat\u201d is a complete order.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBarbershop Talk\n\nOne of the things you will have to learn about barbershops is that the conversation is intense, often hilarious, often loud and always wrong.\n\nTake everything you hear in a black barbershop with a grain of salt. Every discussion skews toward Hotep conspiracy theories and contains thirdhand information from a cousin, something they read on the internet and stuff \u201ceverybody knows.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though this sounds bad, barbershop discussions are the most entertaining things ever created. If you want to know why the CIA put crack in black neighborhoods to trade cocaine for guns, go to a black barbershop. If you want to hear how Allen Iverson should\u2019ve been in the NFL, go to a black barbershop. If you want to hear how reality-show Judge Joe Brown proved James Earl Ray didn\u2019t kill Martin Luther King Jr. ... it\u2019s all crazy.\n\nAlso ... all those things are true.\n\nI read them on my cousin\u2019s Facebook page. Everybody knows it, though.\n\nThe Cornerstone of the Black Community Headquarters\n\nFinally, the most important thing to remember about the black barbershop is that they are all a combination of Bat Cave, information headquarters and community center. Every source of knowledge and information derives from this cultural cornerstone, including:\n\nShopping: It is the black Walmart. A black barbershop is the only place you can still find DVDs, mixtapes, clothing, medicine, beauty supplies and even food.\n\n\n\nIt is the black Walmart. A black barbershop is the only place you can still find DVDs, mixtapes, clothing, medicine, beauty supplies and even food. Employment office: If you are unfortunate enough to lose your job, go get a haircut. By the time you leave, you\u2019ll find out who\u2019s hiring, how much they pay, if and when they drug-test and who you should talk to in their human resource department. (Spoiler alert: Her name is Sheila. It\u2019s always Sheila.) If none of this works, you can always make a few dollars sweeping up hair.\n\n\n\nIf you are unfortunate enough to lose your job, go get a haircut.

Social media: I believe that black barbers should file a class action lawsuit against Twitter and Facebook for stealing their ideas. Before Mark Zuckerberg was a glimmer in his father\u2019s eye, barbershops had thumbtacks so you could \u201cpost\u201d your \u201cevent pages\u201d on the \u201cwall.\u201d Many walls even featured \u201cprofile pictures\u201d of the haircuts they offered, and when you entered the door, you had to give everyone a \u201cstatus update\u201d in less than 140 characters. And there was always a customer waiting who had a bad kid running around the shop. That kid\u2019s name? Tweet. Coincidence? I think not.\n\n\n\nI believe that black barbers should file a class action lawsuit against Twitter and Facebook for stealing their ideas.

Sure, taking my mortgage payment down to Kutz 4 Kingz is sometimes a hassle, but it was well worth it.\n\n\n\nThis is how you support black-owned businesses. Looking for a mechanic? A carpenter?

And the buxom, gray-eyed, Afro-rocking, melanin-poppin\u2019 recording artist is making major waves online, mostly because of the criticism surrounding her dark skin and kinky hair.\n\nBefore you check your calendar, yes, I can confirm that it is indeed 2018 and we\u2019re still talking about skin tones and hair textures not fitting into society\u2019s limited beauty standards.\n\nAmara recently appeared on The Breakfast Club, and the first question one of the show\u2019s hosts, Charlamagne tha God, asked her was, \u201cWhat are you? Racewise?\u201d I should have known from there that the interview would take an ignorant turn.\n\n\n\nOnce she said that she was Dominican and called herself an Afro-Latina, The Breakfast Club co-host DJ Envy chimed in with, \u201cWhat is Afro-Latina? I thought it was half-black and something else, half-Latina.\u201d I couldn\u2019t handle DJ Envy\u2019s views of Amara\u2019s background when he said that he thought Dominicans didn\u2019t really mess with blacks or Puerto Ricans.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t want to be black and they didn\u2019t want to be Puerto Rican,\u201d DJ Envy so eloquently deduced. This guy. I\u2019m not even going to dig into that; I just wanted you to know that\u2019s something this man said ... out loud.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo which Charlamagne offered Amara, \u201cYou can say you\u2019re a Latina with an Afro.\u201d\n\nWell, gee, can I?!\n\n\n\nAmara appeared poised throughout the entire interview, during which she spoke about her (and society\u2019s) issues with colorism, some producer named Young Hollywood and why representation matters. Young Hollywood is a Love & Hip Hop: Miami castmate whose biggest claim to fame, as it stands, is his ignorant critique of Amara\u2019s image.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the show, Young Hollywood has urged Amara to consider making her look more Beyonc\u00e9 and less Macy Gray. We all know how much representation matters, and even though Love & Hip Hop: Miami may not be the most savory form of representation, you can\u2019t deny how smart the show\u2019s creator and producer, Mona Scott-Young, is for opening up this problematic dialogue to the show\u2019s demographic.\n\nColorism is a hot-button topic that many of us debate, but allowing this subject to take root in a (dare I say it) shallow pond of viewers who are mostly watching to see who splashes what in whose face is golden.\n\n\n\nI find it interesting that Amara is becoming the face of the colorism debate in the Latinx community, but I find it appalling that someone like Charlamagne tha God would ask her, \u201cYou sure it\u2019s not in your mind?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs. He. Serious?\n\n\n\nI respect Charlamagne, despite his problematic nature. The last time we spoke was in The Root\u2019s offices, where I asked him about his opinion about black women. The conversation was enlightening, to say the least, and it made me a believer in Charlamagne\u2019s mission of keeping black excellence on full display. But his thoughts on Amara\u2019s plight as a dark-skinned Dominican woman gave me pause.\n\nHe said, \u201cI\u2019ve never heard this conversation until just now.\u201d And when he went on to ask, \u201cWhat is the struggle that you\u2019re facing?\u201d I almost couldn\u2019t believe that this man who\u2019s had issues with the pigmentation of his own skin would ask this Afro-Latina woman what struggle she\u2019s facing, as if he has no idea what colorism is and how it affects people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo add insult to, well, insult, Charlamagne brought up Cardi B and her success as a measure of how far we\u2019ve come in accepting people who aren\u2019t cookie-cutter. Sure, but using Cardi B as an example in this conversation about colorism isn\u2019t valid because Cardi B isn\u2019t a dark-skinned Afro-Latina.\n\nMost of the interview was ignorant and irresponsible. It was a missed opportunity to continue a dialogue around representation and colorism in the entertainment industry on the mega platform that is The Breakfast Club. Kudos to Amara La Negra, however, for her attempt to keep the conversation going and for representing for the little dark-skinned girls who may think they\u2019re not beautiful.

As I am one of the world\u2019s leading scholars on the subject, Wypipology: The Essential Guide to Understanding White People, will be a semiserious satire dissecting my life\u2019s work in the uncharted field of Wypipology. I have no idea who, if anyone, will read it. I just think it\u2019s a funny idea that can also unveil some truth under the guise of comedy.\n\nOn Friday, comedian, actress and world-renowned owner of an unnecessary apostrophe, Mo\u2019Nique, appeared on The Breakfast Club to confront Charlamagne tha God for naming her the \u201cDonkey of the Day\u201d in January after Mo\u2019Nique called for Netflix to be placed somewhere between H&M and R. Kelly\u2019s music on the list of things black people say they\u2019re boycotting but still support on the down low (because, as the great pedophile purveyor of pee-pee once sang: \u201cNobody has to knoooow\u201d).\n\nMo\u2019 evoked her age, her award r\u00e9sum\u00e9, her status as a legend, the history of black women and even the civil rights struggle in her well-laid-out argument on why she considered CandyCorn Face tha God\u2019s use of \u201cdonkey\u201d disrespectful. She, unfortunately, dismantled her logic-based assertions every time she publicly referred to her husband-manager (who was on the phone) as \u201cDaddy.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCharlamagne tha Lawd listened intently and presented his own reasons for why he felt she deserved to be called a \u201cdonkey\u201d for overvaluing her worth as a celebrity and boycott kickstarter. The entire exchange was compelling, and both sides came away from it looking simultaneously petulant and convincing in the disagreement.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing. Maybe they were both right.\n\nCharlamagne talks on the radio for a living. Besides providing a platform for Negro-hating white women, and calibrating his disdain for black women based on the amount of melanin in their skin (to be fair, long before he dismissed Amara La Negra\u2019s colorism claims, Charlamagne tha Goddamn Fool explained that \u201cwhite girls are poppin\u2019 right now\u201d), his primary job is as a shade thrower and shit starter. He does it well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo his credit, Charlie was willing to face his critics, and anything he said in their absence, he will say in their presence\u2014most famously to Birdman, who forever blessed us with a never-expiring meme when the Cash Money millionaire implored Charlamagne tha Bomb Pop face to \u201cput some respeck\u201d on his name.\n\nRegardless of my feelings about Charlamagne, some people respeck him for that. In his hometown of Moncks Corner, S.C. (the home of my mother), that is the law. You can say anything about anyone, as long as you are willing to say it to their face. He tried to explain why he called Mo\u2019Nique a donkey while she was present.\n\nAnd even though Charlamagne tha Messiah is often problematic, he didn\u2019t run. Like Erik Killmonger and people who can\u2019t stop themselves from dancing to the remix to \u201cIgnition,\u201d he handled it the wrong way, which she told him in private, after the mics were off:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever you feel about Mo\u2019Nique, it is impossible to deny her credentials. She is one of the few black female comedians to have ever entered the stratosphere of the top echelon of joke tellers\u2014black or white. Lest we forget, she has a little thing I like to call an \u201cAcademy Award.\u201d\n\n\n\nHer dispute with Netflix aside, one cannot reach the levels of success that she has achieved without talent and hard work. Her unwillingness to accept an offer that she feels devalues her as a performer and a human being shouldn\u2019t be dismissed in the equation. Whether or not anyone else feels she has overestimated her value is inconsequential.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI wish I had Mo\u2019Nique\u2019s level of confidence and self-value. The idea that others cannot determine the value of your work is an important lesson. Maybe she should treat people better. Maybe she isn\u2019t as funny or as popular as she and her \u201cDaddy\u201d believes (I feel like I should put my name on the sex offender\u2019s registry every time I type that), but her willingness to say \u201cFuck your couch\u201d and stand on principle is admirable.\n\nMo\u2019Nique is right. Black is often devalued because it is black. Women are often lowballed because they are women. It is difficult to live in that reality and reject it as a reason that she believes Netflix undervalued her. Even if she is wrong about Netflix, her larger point is also correct.\n\nTalent and ability mean a little less when you are black and belligerent in a Caucasian industry. Despite the fact that Ben Shapiro, Dinesh D\u2019Souza and even Milo Yiannopoulos had lucrative book deals, I\u2019m sure there won\u2019t be a bidding war for a satirical tome about white people. The probable lack of interest from publishers won\u2019t be based on numbers, analytics or a r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany of them will probably be apprehensive because, like Mo\u2019Nique and Charlamagne, I have a history of publicly pissing off white people. And I, like them, wholeheartedly believe everything I say is entertaining, honest and\u2014most important\u2014correct. But it will probably cost me. I\u2019m fine with that.\n\nI guess what I\u2019m trying to say is this:\n\nHey, my loves,\n\nBecause of discrimination and bias, I\u2019m calling for us to come together as a people and stand with me in this boycott against all books and everything white, including Apple chargers, Q-Tips and granulated sugar, until a publisher presents me with a check for $10 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI love us, for real.", "keywords": ["calling", "charlamagne", "tha", "netflix", "wrong", "spoiler", "white", "say", "women", "face", "alert", "answer", "im", "black", "donkey", "monique"], "polarity": 0.06354760006075795, "subjectivity": 0.4925099206349207},

And indeed, while research is sparse, at least one double-blind study concluded that Viviscal, a supplement containing biotin, not only supported hair growth but also helped to prevent the shedding associated with hair loss in women.\n\nBut do the risks outweigh the rewards? The Food and Drug Administration is now warning that high doses of biotin can confuse the results of hundreds of common lab tests, including some used to diagnose a heart attack, cancer and even pregnancy. In some cases, the presence of the vitamin caused lab results to skew high, while in others, results were misleadingly low.\n\nThough the FDA doesn\u2019t raise any health concerns about taking biotin\u2014which is occasionally prescribed in high doses to treat nerve pain\u2014an overabundance of biotin in the bloodstream can also skew the results of thyroid tests, occasionally leading to false diagnoses of Graves\u2019 disease in adults and children.\n\nWhile this is news to us, lab technicians have apparently been aware of this complication for some time, and are relieved that the FDA is finally raising a red flag about the issue.

Leveraging their popular podcast into TV stardom, \u201cthe Bodega Boys\u201d riff on popular culture, politics and (mostly) white people. They\u2019ve become the popular destination for the coolest guests because their show is basically The Daily Show if Trevor Noah were a pair of weed-smoking, 40-ounce-drinking dudes from the Bronx, N.Y..\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Bodega Boys\u2019 beef with DJ Envy began when text messages surfaced of DJ Envy (who is married) chatting with someone who suggested butt play with the Power 105.1 FM host. As usual, Desus and Mero became the hood version of CNN, exposing the story:\n\nThe dispute continued when DJ Envy appeared on an episode of The Real with his wife, seemingly trying to contain the damage. The couple was very honest about the radio host\u2019s past indiscretions, making it appear that they had fixed all of their problems. Desus and Mero, who never shy away from controversy, made fun of the appearance by Envy and his wife because ... well, that\u2019s what they do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, on Thursday morning, Desus and Mero appeared on The Breakfast Club. Envy was in his feelings from the time the men walked in, and there was nothing wrong with that except the men didn\u2019t realize there was a beef.\n\n\n\nAfter introducing his guests as \u201cDickhead\u201d and \u201cPussy,\u201d which is mad passive-aggressive and totally light-skinned, Envy began to explain the impetus behind his beige rage. (Oh, did I mention that Envy was sporting a \u201cMy God vs. My Enemies\u201d hat, which was totally planned because isn\u2019t it just like a light-skinned man to wear passive-aggressive clothing to a fuss fight?)\n\n\u201cYou owe my wife an apology,\u201d Envy said to a baffled Desus and Mero. \u201cWhen you insinuated that she was there for the check.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen DJ Envy played the clip in which Desus and Mero totally insinuated that Envy\u2019s wife was sticking around for the check. Envy wasn\u2019t going full light-skinned for being mad about that. It was a low blow for the talk show guests to take shots at Envy\u2019s wife. Envy explained that wives and children were off-limits, and the guests agreed and apologized.\n\nWhere Envy drove his Jeep Grand Cherokee off the road (yes, Jeep Grand Cherokees are the preferred cars of light-skinned men; just ask any Kappa) was when he couldn\u2019t let it go. He literally stewed in his anger like a spoiled child unable to accept that he\u2019d actually gotten his way. Not sure if Envy came into work looking for a fight, but what he found was an apology, and that wasn\u2019t good enough.\n\nEnvy proceeded to hard-chew his gum (totally light-skinned and passive-aggressive), and make snide remarks before he went full Sinbad and walked off the show, undoing all of Matt Barnes\u2019 good work to dispel the myth that light-skinned men will walk off the air.\n\nAt that point, if Envy was still upset, he should\u2019ve reached across the table and taken a swing at Desus (because Mero is heavier; Dominican\u2014which means there is a 62 percent chance he had a razor under his tongue; and because I\u2019m not here for light-skinned-on-light-skinned crime).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know, because that is what rapper Casanova 2x would\u2019ve done. He is my spiritual guide whenever I\u2019m trying to sort out whether or not I\u2019m inside my light-skinned bag. I can\u2019t see Casanova 2x pushing the microphone away and storming out of the interview after receiving an apology, if for no other reason than he made this song and you can\u2019t get passive-aggressive after rhyming that you would punch someone\u2019s teeth out.\n\nMy sources tell me that Envy walked off the air and into his office, where he took a few swings at the air and then curled up on the floor in the fetal position and had a good cry, and it was well-earned.

And, while, no, Charlamagne didn\u2019t talk about killing trans women, Ashlee Marie Preston said that Charlamagne was the ringleader of Lil Duval\u2019s transphobic rhetoric on The Breakfast Club Friday morning.\n\nShe said there was no reason to ask the comedian about Donald Trump\u2019s ban on transgender troops serving in the military, which led to his using a transphobic slur that starts with a \u201ct.\u201d In addition, Lil Duval isn\u2019t particularly known for his insights on military policy. Breakfast Club co-host DJ Envy further exacerbated the drama by asking how Lil Duval would respond if a woman revealed that she was transgender after four months of dating. His reply that she would end up dead was one Charlamagne and crew surely expected.\n\n\u201cThey brought that up knowing he would have a reaction,\u201d said Preston, who staged an action against Charlamagne at Politicon in Pasadena, Calif., on Sunday. \u201cThey know we\u2019re in the age of pro-trans identity, of doing better and being decent people. So they still wanted to get that buzz when they were the ones making those statements directly. But they wanted to use Lil Duval as the voice for what they really wanted to say.\u201d\n\nThe Breakfast Club co-hosts defended themselves Monday morning, with Charlamagne defiantly saying, \u201cI\u2019m not apologizing for the words of Lil Duval.\u201d\n\nPreston said that\u2019s a cop-out. The co-hosts knew that asking the comedian about trans issues would evoke a controversial statement, making them equally accountable, she said. Preston, who is the first transgender editor in chief of the intersectional feminist magazine Wear Your Voice, is joining other trans activists in trying to force The Breakfast Club to confront what they say is its casual acceptance of transphobic behavior. Elle Hearns, founder and executive director of the Marsha P. Johnson Institute, started a petition to boycott The Breakfast Club. Raquel Willis started #TransFolksAreNotJokes on Saturday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn interviews with The Root, transgender activists said that they are organizing efforts to force iHeartRadio, the company that owns The Breakfast Club, to apologize. The petition organized by Hearns goes further, demanding that Charlamagne apologize for allowing a transphobic conversation to take place and that iHeartRadio cancel the show.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that any person who is born with any kind of consciousness could ever take joy in watching people be hurt,\u201d Hearns said. \u201cHe has a long history of anti-black rhetoric with black women. To watch black trans women be disrespected is to also watch black women be disrespected. And we\u2019ve seen that behavior from him many times before, which is why he, in particular, has become a target because of his unwillingness to acknowledge that he is wrong.\u201d\n\nWhat neither Charlamagne nor his co-hosts seem to understand is that the very passive tone of their conversation with Lil Duval creates a culture where violence against trans women is accepted, the activists told me. Human Rights Watch reports that 22 trans women have been killed in the United States so far in 2017, with most of them being trans women of color.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I asked if the activists would be willing to speak with Charlamagne, some of them kept that door open, citing one exception: not on his show. Giving The Breakfast Club ratings isn\u2019t something they\u2019re interested in. Besides, they say they are not very optimistic that talking to him will do that much good. Days before Lil Duval\u2019s transphobic appearance, Janet Mock spoke with the co-hosts about being transgender. A few days later, Charlamagne used her as a sexual prop for Lil Duval\u2019s sick humor by raising her name in his discussion with Duval.\n\nIn Allure, Mock spoke out against the show\u2019s treatment of her.\n\n\u201cHe was completely dismissive of that experience and allowed her to be a punch line and material for a comedian,\u201d Willis said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to put myself in that situation. If it was outside of the show, if it was a panel or a discussion between us two, I would go to an event like that and be a part of that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Lil Duval episode is about trans black women, but there is a larger, overarching issue concerning what they feel is Charlamagne\u2019s anti-black woman rhetoric, L\u2019lerr\u00e9t Ailith, communications director for Black Youth Project 100, told me. Charlamagne likes to project an image of wokeness, she said, given his support of the Black Lives Matter movement and his political engagement in the 2016 election, though he seems to fail when it comes to gender.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to continue to cape for Charlamagne and say he just needs to be educated,\u201d Ailith said. \u201cJanet Mock was just on his show. As she wrote in her article, she doesn\u2019t do Trans 101, but she did it for them. She went step by step, educating them on the basics of what it means to be a trans person very eloquently, and Charlamagne still refuses to take that lesson and incorporate it into his politics. I don\u2019t think he is really willing to relinquish himself the bigotry he internalized.\u201d\n\nIn December he sparked controversy when he tweeted that more black women need to build platforms like Tomi Lahren, the young white woman who used her time at TheBlaze to direct racist diatribes at black people for mass white supremacist consumption. He didn\u2019t help quell reactions from black women by having her on his show, either. Media executive Jamilah Lemieux and social-justice activist Amber Phillips appeared on his show in an attempt to explain why giving Lahren a platform was ill-advised.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, like clockwork, it appears to have done little good. Charlamagne continues to propagate anti-trans behavior, which is why the activists aren\u2019t backing down from their demands that his show be held accountable. Twitter users are continuing to upload videos of support to #TransFolksAreNotJokes. The #BreakfastClubBoycott petition is gaining stream, and Preston is planning further actions against The Breakfast Club this week.\n\nTrying to reason with Charlamagne\u2019s indignation is pointless, she said.\n\n\u201cThere need to be consequences.\u201d Preston said. \u201cIf we just tell people, \u2018You should be a better person and you should feel different,\u2019 what is that? We\u2019re still going to lose our lives. They are still going to say problematic things and reinforcing ideologies that put us in danger. What we\u2019re learning is that some of the strongest forms of activism is when you hit a muthafucka in their pockets. Period.

And the buxom, gray-eyed, Afro-rocking, melanin-poppin\u2019 recording artist is making major waves online, mostly because of the criticism surrounding her dark skin and kinky hair.\n\nBefore you check your calendar, yes, I can confirm that it is indeed 2018 and we\u2019re still talking about skin tones and hair textures not fitting into society\u2019s limited beauty standards.\n\nAmara recently appeared on The Breakfast Club, and the first question one of the show\u2019s hosts, Charlamagne tha God, asked her was, \u201cWhat are you? Racewise?\u201d I should have known from there that the interview would take an ignorant turn.\n\n\n\nOnce she said that she was Dominican and called herself an Afro-Latina, The Breakfast Club co-host DJ Envy chimed in with, \u201cWhat is Afro-Latina? I thought it was half-black and something else, half-Latina.\u201d I couldn\u2019t handle DJ Envy\u2019s views of Amara\u2019s background when he said that he thought Dominicans didn\u2019t really mess with blacks or Puerto Ricans.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t want to be black and they didn\u2019t want to be Puerto Rican,\u201d DJ Envy so eloquently deduced. This guy. I\u2019m not even going to dig into that; I just wanted you to know that\u2019s something this man said ... out loud.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo which Charlamagne offered Amara, \u201cYou can say you\u2019re a Latina with an Afro.\u201d\n\nWell, gee, can I?!\n\n\n\nAmara appeared poised throughout the entire interview, during which she spoke about her (and society\u2019s) issues with colorism, some producer named Young Hollywood and why representation matters. Young Hollywood is a Love & Hip Hop: Miami castmate whose biggest claim to fame, as it stands, is his ignorant critique of Amara\u2019s image.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the show, Young Hollywood has urged Amara to consider making her look more Beyonc\u00e9 and less Macy Gray. We all know how much representation matters, and even though Love & Hip Hop: Miami may not be the most savory form of representation, you can\u2019t deny how smart the show\u2019s creator and producer, Mona Scott-Young, is for opening up this problematic dialogue to the show\u2019s demographic.\n\nColorism is a hot-button topic that many of us debate, but allowing this subject to take root in a (dare I say it) shallow pond of viewers who are mostly watching to see who splashes what in whose face is golden.\n\n\n\nI find it interesting that Amara is becoming the face of the colorism debate in the Latinx community, but I find it appalling that someone like Charlamagne tha God would ask her, \u201cYou sure it\u2019s not in your mind?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs. He. Serious?\n\n\n\nI respect Charlamagne, despite his problematic nature. The last time we spoke was in The Root\u2019s offices, where I asked him about his opinion about black women. The conversation was enlightening, to say the least, and it made me a believer in Charlamagne\u2019s mission of keeping black excellence on full display. But his thoughts on Amara\u2019s plight as a dark-skinned Dominican woman gave me pause.\n\nHe said, \u201cI\u2019ve never heard this conversation until just now.\u201d And when he went on to ask, \u201cWhat is the struggle that you\u2019re facing?\u201d I almost couldn\u2019t believe that this man who\u2019s had issues with the pigmentation of his own skin would ask this Afro-Latina woman what struggle she\u2019s facing, as if he has no idea what colorism is and how it affects people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo add insult to, well, insult, Charlamagne brought up Cardi B and her success as a measure of how far we\u2019ve come in accepting people who aren\u2019t cookie-cutter. Sure, but using Cardi B as an example in this conversation about colorism isn\u2019t valid because Cardi B isn\u2019t a dark-skinned Afro-Latina.\n\nMost of the interview was ignorant and irresponsible. It was a missed opportunity to continue a dialogue around representation and colorism in the entertainment industry on the mega platform that is The Breakfast Club. Kudos to Amara La Negra, however, for her attempt to keep the conversation going and for representing for the little dark-skinned girls who may think they\u2019re not beautiful.

Remember? It was just a few days ago when Nunberg received a subpoena from special counselor Robert Mueller, who\u2019s about to blow this whole Russia-Trump scandal out of the water, but Nunberg was acting like Training Day Denzel, claiming that he wasn\u2019t fishing through some 800 emails and he wasn\u2019t going to comply with anything because it was stupid and time-consuming. He also was so unhinged that a CNN anchor asked if he had been drinking because she smelled alcohol on his breath.\n\n\n\nWell, what do you know? It looks like Nunberg has come to his senses and did what we all knew he was going to do because guys like him don\u2019t do well in prison. Just two days after he went on a Ferris Bueller-style media blitz of epic rants, including challenging Mueller to arrest him, he\u2019s completely changed his tune.\n\nIn an interview with WABC Radio, Nunberg turned church boy and noted that he gathered everything that the subpoena asked for\u2014including emails, text messages and communications he had with 10 campaign associates\u2014and handed it all over before Wednesday\u2019s deadline.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not holding anything back. ...

Now my hair is a few inches past my shoulders and longer and thicker than it ever was when it was relaxed.\n\n\n\nI give all the glory in my natural-hair journey to Lenelle Howell, the person who convinced me to go natural, but who is also the person who used to give me relaxers. I know I\u2019m supposed to give all glory to God, but as a black woman (and an agnostic), the closest thing I know to a deity is Lenelle, my hairdresser. She is my alpha and omega. My comforter in times of need. She is my rock in a weary land, and often\u2014when she finishes a new hairdo\u2014I have screamed \u201cHallelujah\u201d and done a Holy Ghost dance.\n\nI met Lenelle in 2010 when I was in an abusive relationship\u2014with my hair. My strands were broken, abused and in desperate need of some tender loving care. While it sometimes takes stylists a few weeks to get the hang of what a client desires, she immediately knew how to transform my sad-ass strands into something happy and manageable.\n\nInitially, I would wash my hair during off-weeks and have her do my touch-ups, occasionally treating myself to a simple wash-and-set (if I was feeling like a rich bitch). Soon it became painfully obvious which weeks she did my hair and which weeks I did, so eventually I decided not to derail her efforts to make my hair healthy and became a pampered weekly client.\n\nI consistently received compliments on my hair, and my Lenelle addiction got so bad that I\u2019d fly to my out-of-town job during the week and fly home simply to have her do work on my locks. She was like my dealer\u2014I\u2019m now convinced that\u2019s why they call it getting one\u2019s hair \u201cfixed.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am not sure when Lenelle and I crossed over from client and stylist to friends, but we did. She wasn\u2019t just my hair\u2019s caretaker; she provided me with an outlet that facilitated my emotional health on so many days. But shortly after she convinced me to adopt the natural-hair lifestyle (ugh ... I can\u2019t believe I just wrote that), I moved from Orlando, Fla., to Atlanta. Atlanta probably has more natural hairstylists per capita than any other place in the country, but none of them was my hairstylist. It was only after my big move that I realized the space Lenelle occupied in my life, and how much I missed her.\n\nRecently we were on the phone for about a half an hour, but only about five minutes of the conversation centered on my hair. We talked about career, men and life; we caught up like I was sitting in her chair. She said something that really resonated with me: \u201cKyla, people don\u2019t know how sensitive you truly are.\u201d\n\nShe wasn\u2019t talking about my hair.\n\nShe would know. She\u2019s seen me completely break down in her chair when my amour du jour wasn\u2019t acting right. She\u2019s seen me in slumps of feeling unlovable, unappreciated and unsure of my next move in life. She\u2019s been my hairdresser from when I was doing poetry as an out-of-control hobby to when it became my full-time job. She\u2019s been a career counselor, a psychologist and a newfound sister.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor black women, the salon has always been a staple of the community, second only to the black church. Beauty salons and barbershops are the institutional centerpieces of black neighborhoods. They are where people talk politics, get the latest \u201ctea,\u201d network, organize community events and even patronize smaller businesses. If you\u2019re having a party or a protest and you need black people\u2019s help, just go to where they\u2019re getting their hair done.\n\nConsider that Madam C.J. Walker, one of the first black millionaires, was a woman selling hair-care products, and that today, black women spend about nine times as much as their nonblack counterparts on hair-care products, it is safe to say that hair is important to black women. The black hairdresser is the high priestess and No. 1 practitioner of #BlackGirlMagic. She can take the homeliest-looking woman and transform her into a veritable snack. Voil\u00e0\u2014magic!\n\nNot only does a black hairdresser have to be dexterously skilled, but she\u2019s also the gatekeeper to intimate secrets. She is the protector, with \u201cWatch out, I\u2019ve heard about him\u201d certainty. She laughs when it\u2019s time to laugh, and heals when it is time to heal, all while standing on her feet all day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe black salon is a transformation chamber, home to hourly Cinderella stories, where black women can forget the pressures of the world\u2014even if they have to sacrifice hot-ass ears under the dryer.\n\nAfter Lenelle\u2019s intervention, my locks are now out of detox and doing much better. Having natural hair has admittedly saved me a lot of time and money, while making my hair much healthier than when I was addicted to the creamy crack. In the past year, I\u2019ve only gone to the salon twice.\n\nBut I miss my weekly therapy sessions with my counselor. I miss the ritual of sitting on Lenelle\u2019s altar to receive her healing blessings. I miss the safe space of being surrounded by women laughing and sharing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI miss my friend.", "keywords": ["shes", "miss", "breakup", "natural", "surviving", "know", "going", "hair", "women", "hairdresser", "missed", "woman", "black", "ive", "lenelle", "weeks"], "polarity": 0.06577585377585381, "subjectivity": 0.4640754208754209},

As did the death of luminaries such as Dick Gregory and Maurice White. But for all their contributions in moving black culture forward, their statuses as legends were solidified prior to their passing. My fear is that Reggie Oss\u00e9, better known as Combat Jack, who at 48 years young succumbed to colon cancer months after announcing his diagnosis, was denied a similar fate.\n\nThe first time I met Combat Jack was in Anaheim, Calif., last October at Now Hear This, an annual festival in which popular podcasters meet their adoring fans and perform their shows live. Riding off the unexpected success of my own podcast, The Extraordinary Negroes, which debuted a few months prior, my black ass was there for one reason and one reason only: to convince him that my show belonged on his Loud Speakers Network.\n\nHome to Kid Fury and Crissle\u2019s inimitable wit, Charlamagne tha Contrarian\u2019s polarizing opinions, Taxstone\u2019s authenticity and Angela Rye\u2019s raised fist, the roster on the Loud Speakers Network (which Combat Jack co-owned) is rivaled only by the Golden State Warriors\u2014just knocking down 30-foot jumpers and dunking on niggas for no reason, scoreboard and feelings be damned.\n\nWith my VIP pass in tow, I crept into some lounge I had no business being in and introduced myself to the man who inspired me to launch my own show, Combat Jack. Since I\u2019m an avid listener of The Combat Jack Show, he was amazed by how effortlessly I could recall minute details. He blistered at N.O.R.E.\u2019s penchant for continually hounding him about a deal he botched as a young lawyer, schooled me on interviewing techniques, gushed over his favorite podcasting equipment and shared a sneak preview of his next endeavor, Mogul, which was released earlier this year to universal acclaim.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmazed that I was able to get this kind of one-on-one time with him, I told him how much of a profound impact he had on me and how he was directly responsible for my own show even existing. Before I knew it, nearly two hours had passed. And as much as I appreciated chopping it up on some barbershop shit, it was time to shoot my shot.\n\nI prattled off about how we tackle difficult subjects within our community but infuse humor in order to make them more digestible. How our show was exactly what his network was missing and how we fit a need. He was impressed at our list of guests. \u201cY\u2019all did that yourself?\u201d Yup.\n\nBut before I could stunt on Instagram and commemorate our new partnership with obnoxious selfies and imaginary bottles of Champagne, I heard three fateful words: \u201cHolla at Matt.\u201d Matt, of course, being the innocuous white guy who, thanks to no formal introduction courtesy of Combat Jack, had no idea I had just spent the last two hours talking to his boss. Matt would also be the one to kill my dreams of throwing on that Loud Speakers jersey by referring me to the contact form on their website. \u201cSubmit your show on there and we\u2019ll check it out.\u201d Ouch. Thanks, Matt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the time, I was devastated, but in hindsight, I realized I wasn\u2019t heavy enough in the podcast game to just waltz up to Combat Jack and expect him to snatch up my show. Dejected, I remember walking back to my car afterward promising myself that the next time I saw him, he would know who the hell I was.\n\nOver the next nine months, I proceeded to bust my ass building momentum for my podcast. Our social media following skyrocketed to over 80,000 followers; we joined forces with the big homies Panama Jackson and Damon Young for a watch party in Washington, D.C., for BET\u2019s The New Edition Story; got shoutouts in numerous publications, including Bitch Media and the New York Times; got invited to SXSW to perform a live episode of our show; announced a partnership with streaming media juggernaut TuneIn; and got nominated for Best Society and Culture Podcast in the People\u2019s Choice Podcast Awards. A bunch of other accolades and opportunities fell into our laps as a direct result of our success. So when I heard that Combat Jack was returning to Los Angeles for BET Weekend in June to do another live show, I was ready this time.\n\nAbout 20 minutes before his show started, I ran into him inside the venue. Much to my surprise, he rolled up on me. \u201cYo, it\u2019s Jay, right?\u201d Wait, what? He must have me confused with somebody else. I started to remind him of how we met at Now Hear This, but he shut me down quick: \u201cYo, I wanna come on your show. I leave on Monday. Let\u2019s make it happen.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhoa.\n\nKnowing how much he prided himself on preparing for his interviews (a trait I inherited from him) and realizing that him coming on to my show was essentially my audition for the Loud Speakers Network, I knew rushing to record that weekend was a terrible idea. Much to even my own surprise, I declined. Instead, I offered to bring him on in a few weeks. To which he replied, \u201cBet. No bullshit. I wanna come on. Y\u2019all moving out here.\u201d He snatched my phone out of my hand, plugged his number in, asked someone to get a picture of us, dapped me up, then dissolved into the crowd. Thankfully, Matt was nowhere to be found this time.\n\nAfter locking in his interview, I was so amped I took my ass straight home after his show and stayed up until 3 a.m. researching him on the internet. Over the course of the next few weeks, I called or texted various people who had personal relationships with him and dragged tidbits of information out of them to craft questions around. After an absurd amount of research and preparation, I was 100 percent confident I would deliver his best interview ever. But sadly, fate had other plans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThough we texted back and forth trying to lock in a date, his schedule was bananas. First it was Vegas, then it was family. Soon it was becoming painfully obvious that the opportunity to interview the man who single-handedly changed my life and so many others was diminishing. But our failure to lock in his interview doesn\u2019t upset me at all. It\u2019s the fact that I never had the opportunity to thank him.\n\nSimply put, in launching the Loud Speakers Network, Combat Jack provided so many of us with a voice. In a world consumed with diluting, disparaging and disposing of any semblance of blackness, he created a platform for us to be our unapologetic selves. And while he wasn\u2019t the first black podcaster, he was easily the most influential. You can literally pinpoint the trajectory of podcasting before and after the birth of the Loud Speakers Network.\n\nIn fact, if you eliminate his contributions and influence, many of your favorite comedians, entertainers and media personalities wouldn\u2019t be where they are today. That\u2019s a fact. The argument can even be made that SoundCloud is only being kept afloat because podcasters funnel so much money into it. Though SoundCloud is widely maligned in podcasting circles, an overwhelming majority of podcasters of color host their own shows on the platform anyway in order to emulate Loud Speakers Network\u2019s formula.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut for creatives such as myself, he provided us with far more than just a voice. He gave us our calling. After moving to Los Angeles in 2014 to jump-start my own writing career, I quickly realized that instead of pounding the pavement to work my way up the food chain, the fastest way to reel in the writing opportunities I wanted was to leverage my personality into popularity.\n\nAs such, podcasting has allowed me to reach millions of people I otherwise never would. It\u2019s allowed me to travel the country and generate awareness around important issues such as mental health in the black community, social justice and the pervasiveness of toxic masculinity. It\u2019s allowed me to change lives, speak in schools and on panels, and celebrate the agency and accomplishments of people of color. Podcasting has provided me with invaluable relationships and has opened countless doors that would otherwise have remained closed. In short, podcasting has given me\u2014and countless others\u2014purpose.\n\nAnd that\u2019s solely because of Combat Jack.\n\nHis death teaches us not only that one man has the power to move mountains but also why it\u2019s important that we champion our heroes while they\u2019re still here to move them.

And, while, no, Charlamagne didn\u2019t talk about killing trans women, Ashlee Marie Preston said that Charlamagne was the ringleader of Lil Duval\u2019s transphobic rhetoric on The Breakfast Club Friday morning.\n\nShe said there was no reason to ask the comedian about Donald Trump\u2019s ban on transgender troops serving in the military, which led to his using a transphobic slur that starts with a \u201ct.\u201d In addition, Lil Duval isn\u2019t particularly known for his insights on military policy. Breakfast Club co-host DJ Envy further exacerbated the drama by asking how Lil Duval would respond if a woman revealed that she was transgender after four months of dating. His reply that she would end up dead was one Charlamagne and crew surely expected.\n\n\u201cThey brought that up knowing he would have a reaction,\u201d said Preston, who staged an action against Charlamagne at Politicon in Pasadena, Calif., on Sunday. \u201cThey know we\u2019re in the age of pro-trans identity, of doing better and being decent people. So they still wanted to get that buzz when they were the ones making those statements directly. But they wanted to use Lil Duval as the voice for what they really wanted to say.\u201d\n\nThe Breakfast Club co-hosts defended themselves Monday morning, with Charlamagne defiantly saying, \u201cI\u2019m not apologizing for the words of Lil Duval.\u201d\n\nPreston said that\u2019s a cop-out. The co-hosts knew that asking the comedian about trans issues would evoke a controversial statement, making them equally accountable, she said. Preston, who is the first transgender editor in chief of the intersectional feminist magazine Wear Your Voice, is joining other trans activists in trying to force The Breakfast Club to confront what they say is its casual acceptance of transphobic behavior. Elle Hearns, founder and executive director of the Marsha P. Johnson Institute, started a petition to boycott The Breakfast Club. Raquel Willis started #TransFolksAreNotJokes on Saturday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn interviews with The Root, transgender activists said that they are organizing efforts to force iHeartRadio, the company that owns The Breakfast Club, to apologize. The petition organized by Hearns goes further, demanding that Charlamagne apologize for allowing a transphobic conversation to take place and that iHeartRadio cancel the show.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that any person who is born with any kind of consciousness could ever take joy in watching people be hurt,\u201d Hearns said. \u201cHe has a long history of anti-black rhetoric with black women. To watch black trans women be disrespected is to also watch black women be disrespected. And we\u2019ve seen that behavior from him many times before, which is why he, in particular, has become a target because of his unwillingness to acknowledge that he is wrong.\u201d\n\nWhat neither Charlamagne nor his co-hosts seem to understand is that the very passive tone of their conversation with Lil Duval creates a culture where violence against trans women is accepted, the activists told me. Human Rights Watch reports that 22 trans women have been killed in the United States so far in 2017, with most of them being trans women of color.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I asked if the activists would be willing to speak with Charlamagne, some of them kept that door open, citing one exception: not on his show. Giving The Breakfast Club ratings isn\u2019t something they\u2019re interested in. Besides, they say they are not very optimistic that talking to him will do that much good. Days before Lil Duval\u2019s transphobic appearance, Janet Mock spoke with the co-hosts about being transgender. A few days later, Charlamagne used her as a sexual prop for Lil Duval\u2019s sick humor by raising her name in his discussion with Duval.\n\nIn Allure, Mock spoke out against the show\u2019s treatment of her.\n\n\u201cHe was completely dismissive of that experience and allowed her to be a punch line and material for a comedian,\u201d Willis said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to put myself in that situation. If it was outside of the show, if it was a panel or a discussion between us two, I would go to an event like that and be a part of that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Lil Duval episode is about trans black women, but there is a larger, overarching issue concerning what they feel is Charlamagne\u2019s anti-black woman rhetoric, L\u2019lerr\u00e9t Ailith, communications director for Black Youth Project 100, told me. Charlamagne likes to project an image of wokeness, she said, given his support of the Black Lives Matter movement and his political engagement in the 2016 election, though he seems to fail when it comes to gender.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to continue to cape for Charlamagne and say he just needs to be educated,\u201d Ailith said. \u201cJanet Mock was just on his show. As she wrote in her article, she doesn\u2019t do Trans 101, but she did it for them. She went step by step, educating them on the basics of what it means to be a trans person very eloquently, and Charlamagne still refuses to take that lesson and incorporate it into his politics. I don\u2019t think he is really willing to relinquish himself the bigotry he internalized.\u201d\n\nIn December he sparked controversy when he tweeted that more black women need to build platforms like Tomi Lahren, the young white woman who used her time at TheBlaze to direct racist diatribes at black people for mass white supremacist consumption. He didn\u2019t help quell reactions from black women by having her on his show, either. Media executive Jamilah Lemieux and social-justice activist Amber Phillips appeared on his show in an attempt to explain why giving Lahren a platform was ill-advised.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, like clockwork, it appears to have done little good. Charlamagne continues to propagate anti-trans behavior, which is why the activists aren\u2019t backing down from their demands that his show be held accountable. Twitter users are continuing to upload videos of support to #TransFolksAreNotJokes. The #BreakfastClubBoycott petition is gaining stream, and Preston is planning further actions against The Breakfast Club this week.\n\nTrying to reason with Charlamagne\u2019s indignation is pointless, she said.\n\n\u201cThere need to be consequences.\u201d Preston said. \u201cIf we just tell people, \u2018You should be a better person and you should feel different,\u2019 what is that? We\u2019re still going to lose our lives. They are still going to say problematic things and reinforcing ideologies that put us in danger. What we\u2019re learning is that some of the strongest forms of activism is when you hit a muthafucka in their pockets. Period.

For some reason I\u2019m compelled to smack the shit out of this cashier!\u201d\n\nThat said, Betsy DeVos is making quite the strong case. Consider what happened Wednesday when DeVos visited Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.\n\nFrom the Huffington Post:\n\nThe brief visit, which was closed to reporters, came three weeks after the mass shooting that killed 17 students and staff members. DeVos took only a handful of questions at a news conference afterward, not getting into specific details about the visit or what policy proposals she would consider to curb gun violence.\n\nThis sounds pretty damn useless.\n\nMany of the students, some of whom have become activists for gun control in the wake of the shooting, said on social media that DeVos didn\u2019t meet with many students and \u201cbarely\u201d responded to their questions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUseless AF.\n\nCarly Novell, an editor at the student newspaper, the Eagle Eye, said that even student publications were restricted from interacting with DeVos and that \u201cno one followed her.\u201d\n\nUseless infinity.\n\nAnna Fusco, Broward Teachers Union president, who was present during DeVos\u2019 visit, confirmed the students\u2019 accounts, telling HuffPost that \u201cthey didn\u2019t see the purpose of her being there.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThai-style fried rice with shrimp and useless.\n\nTo be fair, DeVos\u2019 entire steez is just one relentless spritz of uselessness.

Jermaine Shoemake is the self-proclaimed \u201cPrince of Pan-Africanism\u201d who goes by that name. A blood relative of Frederick Douglass, he is a school psychologist who travels the country lecturing on the education of black boys, African culture and the need for African-centered education. He donates most of his time to raising money so that he can open a school for black boys.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat sounds incredible!\n\nIndeed it does, except that none of the shit in that previous paragraph is true.\n\nWait ... what?\n\nFor starters, no one has been able to find any evidence that Jermaine Shoemake (or Umar\u2014the name he gave himself) has a doctoral degree. Either he is lying about his Ph.D. in psychology, or he matriculated at the same educational institution as Dr. Dre, Dr. J and Nasir Jones, who achieved his advanced degree in 1999 and proudly proclaimed himself \u201cDr. Knockboot.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter his Breakfast Club appearance, someone on Twitter did offer a valid explanation for Shoemake\u2019s claims:\n\nWhy would Frederick Douglass\u2019 grandnephew do this?\n\nBecause that was a lie, too. While it is impossible to confirm that no Douglass blood flows through Shoemake\u2019s veins, in 2016 the descendants of Douglass issued a statement:\n\nThe family of Frederick Douglass has received numerous inquiries about Umar Johnson questioning his relationship to Frederick Douglass. There have also been questions about the legitimacy of his PhD and handling of the donations he\u2019s received for a school he is promoting. We can tell you with 100% certainty that he is not a descendant of Frederick Douglass. With that being said, Mr. Johnson is very careful not to bill himself as a \u201cdescendant\u201d, but he doesn\u2019t correct people when they refer to him in this way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMan, that is disappointing. It\u2019s sad that he had to create a false history to build a school for black boys, because ... wait. Why are you looking at me like that? Are you about to tell me that the school is bullshit, too?\n\nNo, I\u2019m not.\n\nOK, I\u2019m kidding. The school is bullshit, too. After historically black St. Paul\u2019s College closed its doors in 2014, Shoemake began a campaign to raise money to buy the property with the purpose of opening a school for black boys. People donated what is estimated to be at least $100,000 to bring this dream to fruition, but no one has seen a school. No one has seen a business plan for a school. No certifying educational organization has seen an application. No one knows what happened to the money.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn his recent appearance on The Breakfast Club, he told Charlamagne that he recently saw some land in South Carolina, but quickly told tha God that he\u2019d talk about it \u201coff air.\u201d\n\nWhat happened in The Breakfast Club interview?\n\nLike always, Shoemake made a lot of salient points about interracial marriage, economic empowerment and racism. But like the huckster he is, he sullied his message with dubious claims, nonfacts and flat-out lies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike what?\n\nLike when he said Chinese is now an official language of South Africa (It isn\u2019t);\n\n\n\nOr when he explained how black men marry out of their race more than all other races combined (they don\u2019t);\n\n\n\nOr when he talked about his six degrees (maybe he was talking about his thermostat);\n\n\n\nOr when he explained how \u201cBuddha\u201d is translated as \u201cthe black face\u201d (also untrue);\n\n\n\nOr when he talked about how Frederick Douglass marred his legacy by marrying a white woman, beginning the sentence with, \u201cTake my ancestor Frederick Douglass\u201d\u2014a clever sleight of hand that averted the term \u201cdescendant.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo why do people listen to him?\n\nBecause, like the story of the angels who followed Satan to Earth when he told them how beautiful their voices sounded, Johnson is charismatic, charming and flattering. No one ever tells black people how beautiful their voices are, so many people are eager to join Johnson\u2019s choir.\n\nThe worst part about charlatans like him is that black people\u2019s voices are beautiful, and it is an indictment of America that a snake-oil salesman can sweet-talk so many people into believing whatever he says. There are people who take his words as fact. Right now, in a barbershop somewhere in America, someone is explaining that Buddha\u2019s last name was Jenkins, and how General Tso was a South African leader of the apartheid movement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo one would be mad at Johnson if he stood in front of audiences and simply said, \u201cThis is what I believe.\u201d His opinions are valid, and many of them reflect the thoughts of the black community as a whole. But he undercuts himself by building his house on a bed of lies.\n\nAnd he steals.\n\nThat\u2019s why he is dangerous. Hypothetically, it would be cool as fuck to hang out with Dracula if all he wanted to do was stay out all night and sleep all day. I\u2019d love to have a homeboy thousands of years old who knows how to talk women into letting him come over to their place. Plus, I\u2019ve always wanted to wear a cape, and it wouldn\u2019t look so out of place if I hung out with an entire crew of cape wearers who weren\u2019t doing superhero cosplay.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, like all vampires, what Dr. Umar Jermaine Shoemake Johnson really wants is to suck the blood out of the black community.

You better be.\n\nYou know who else is out here winning? Blond racists. That's right; Tomi Lahren is out here spewing hatred and getting cupcakes and endorsements from Charlamagne Tha God. Ms. Patti Patti and I try to figure out why and how the Goldilocks of racism became a thing and why Trevor Noah sent her cupcakes. And why Charlamagne now thinks Lahren's the second coming of Christ and women of color need to be \"woke\" like her.

When he tried to defend himself, he was sued in civil court. I\u2019ve seen the accusations become more horrific and extreme with time and I\u2019ve witnessed my father\u2019s reputation and legendary works be dismissed without any proof. I strongly believe my father is innocent of the crimes that are alleged against him and I believe that racism has played a big role in all aspects of this scandal. How the charges came against him, how people believed them before they were ever scrutinized or tested, how people who questioned the claims were shut down and ignored.\n\nShe went on to say that the media has created a circus out of her and her siblings\u2019 father:\n\nThe media created the story and the outcome before any court will ever test the claims. How my father is being punished by a society that still believes that black men rape white women that passes off as \u2018boys will be boys\u2019 when white men are accused. How the politics of our country prove my disgust. My father has been publicly lynched in the media. My family, my young daughter, my young niece and nephew have had to stand helplessly by and watch the double standards of pretending to protect the rights of some, but ignoring the rights of others and exposing innocent children to such appalling accusations about someone they love dearly and who has been so loving and kind to them is beyond cruel.\n\nErinn, who spoke out last month, reiterated her sister\u2019s statements: \u201cOver the last few years, my family has been forced to sit down and watch as our father has been attacked in the media.

Most of her thoughts come from the same cesspool of right-wing catchphrases that have polluted the airwaves for decades. And she can parade her vomit of conservative talking points on-air because TheBlaze hired her and gave her that platform. She just\u2026existed. That's like saying we should be more like air\u2026 but precisely 5000% less useful than that.\n\nLahren gets paid to read a teleprompter. She doesn\u2019t work towards justice. She doesn\u2019t battle on the streets in civil disobedience. She doesn\u2019t advance any noteworthy cause for equality. Hell, she doesn\u2019t even have to do the basic work that even neo-Nazi creators have to do, like publish, produce, film, edit, or market. She doesn\u2019t do any fucking thing to advance her Bullshit White Opinions\u2122 except read 3rd grade rants on cue.

Umm\u2026Black women are doing the damn thing\n\nWhile propping up Darth Neo-Con Becky, Charlamagne completely erased the Black women in entertainment and media who actually do the work he said we need to do. Did Franchesca Ramsey disappear all of a sudden? Crissle claps back at White foolishment on multiple media outlets on a regular. Luvvie Ajayi has become a national treasure. Kimberly Foster built up For Harriet with nothing but grit and started creating regular video content. Ava DuVernay is making award-winning films and documentaries and addictive TV shows. (Editor's note: There's also Morgan Debaun, Evelyn From The Internets, Another Round, Aisha Harris's Represent podcast at Slate, my cousin sarah huny young\u2026)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeyond that, there are hundreds of Black women who work their asses off to get a voice in this uber-competitive field but there\u2019s this little thing called WHITE PRIVILEGE THAT MAKES IT KINDA HARD FOR BLACK WOMEN TO RECEIVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES AND CHANCES AND CHANCES TO FAIL THAT WHITE WOMEN DO.\n\n3. Charlamagne is Anti-Ciara Twitter personified\n\nCTG is the type of nigga who gets mad at a Black woman for dealing with an ain\u2019t-shit dude and also for moving on from said dude. Basically, he's chair, CEO, and majority owner of Future Hive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf a Black women rants regularly in the media, she's angry. If we move like Gs in silence like lasagna, we're not being loud enough. For men like him, we can't ever do right. (Unless you're his dermatologist. He whips out mentions of homegirl like she's the token Black best friend.)\n\nNot only do the Donkey Every Day's comments smack of ignorance, but they display the type of vitriol some Black dudes can have for Black women regardless of what we do. His original tweet\u2014which started the firestorm of clapbacks against him\u2014 wasn\u2019t an innocent observation. It was an accusation. Bruh used \u201cwoke\u201d in quotes as if we just \u201cplay-play\u201d getting angry and starting movements and marching in streets and working in non-profits for his dumbass just for shits and giggles.\n\nBoy just say you don\u2019t like Black women and gone about your day. Save them extras characters on Twitter. It'll give you more time to re-up your \"exfoliation\" regimen and fit in with the Tomis of the world.

Envy, Charlamagne tha God and Angela Yee.\n\nHill not only talked about his road to success\u2014from dropping out of Morehouse to homelessness, from selling incense on the streets of Atlanta to receiving a Ph.D.\u2014but also made it clear that when it comes to the 2016 presidential election, there is no \"lesser of two evils\" in our current political duopoly.\n\nW.E.B. Du Bois said in 1956, \u201cI believe that democracy has so far disappeared in the United States that no \u2018two evils\u2019 exist.\u201d Hill takes that philosophy and makes it plain.\n\n\n\nThe DNC disappointed me because it looked like a Republican convention. \u2026 \u201c[Democrats] tried to take the patriotism language that the Republicans usually use in their conferences and used it for their own. They talked about war. They talked about the economy in a way that sounded like Republicans from 20 years ago.

I'm scared of us as a country moving in the wrong direction. \u2026 Republicans are always talking about terrorism, but Democrats are playing on a certain kind of terrorism, too.

But if the differences between the two candidates aren't vast enough, then I would rather introduce a third candidate to build a movement. Because every four years we say, 'The third party can't win.' So we never invest in the third party. We never grow the third party. If they get 5 percent of the vote, they can be in the debates. And if they're in the debates, now we can change the conversation.\n\nAfter Envy said that Democrats voting third party would take votes away from Clinton, ultimately paving the way for a Donald Trump presidency, Hill laid the truth on the table:\n\n\n\nI would rather have Trump be president for four years and build a real left-wing movement that can get us what we deserve as a people, than to let Hillary be president and we stay locked in the same space where we don't get what we want.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHill went on to say that he would rather Trump not be president, period, but that we can't keep investing in \"imperfect Democrats who don't take us anywhere.\"\n\n\n\nWe can afford to lose an election; we can't afford to lose our values.\n\nWatch below for Hill talking more Trump, \"black-on-black\" crime as pathology and Drake's \"light-skin\" music:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso on The Root: \u201cDear Centrists: The Left Has Something to Say Whether You Like It or Not\u201d", "keywords": ["lamont", "republicans", "trump", "vote", "green", "talked", "democrats", "party", "election", "values", "say", "afford", "marc", "lose", "hill", "theyre", "president", "voting"], "polarity": 0.07415824915824916, "subjectivity": 0.40971620971620976},

South Africans were generally friendly, but I was struck by how optimistic they were about the future of the country even though apartheid had only ended, like, 15 minutes ago (1991, to be exact). I couldn\u2019t understand why they weren\u2019t more enraged and bitter. One night at dinner, I asked one of my colleagues why.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here in a restaurant that you couldn\u2019t eat at when you were 16 years old because of apartheid. That\u2019s not ancient history. That\u2019s high school. Doesn\u2019t that make you angry still?\u201d I asked. \u201cThe last \u2018Whites Only\u2019 sign was probably taken down 10 years before I was born\u2014but black Americans are still pissed about racism, past and ongoing.\u201d\n\nShe considered my question for a minute, probably thinking of a way to explain a lot of complicated history to an American outsider.\n\n\u201cWell, we got our country back,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re home; it\u2019s our land. You fought and you\u2019re still in a place that doesn\u2019t want you.\u201d\n\nThat simple conversation explains a lot about the current social media flap about conservative host Tomi Lahren, The Daily Show host Trevor Noah and radio personality Charlamagne tha God from The Breakfast Club. Sometimes our legitimate black anger doesn\u2019t let us see what\u2019s going on and blinds us to how blacks in the Diaspora view American race relations.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Trevor Noah interviewed the Blaze\u2019s Tomi Lahren last week, no one predicted that it would create so many trending hot takes. Objectively, Noah\u2019s interview with Lahren was pretty good. Many of his longtime, mostly white, media critics turned away from their Jon Stewart memorial shrines long enough to praise Noah for coming into his own. Many black pundits and Twitterati did drive-by analyses of the interview after it went viral (because let\u2019s be honest; The Daily Show audience doesn\u2019t boast a regular large black viewership). The general consensus was either 1) Noah let Lahren off too easy or 2) he never should\u2019ve given her bigoted views a platform to begin with.\n\nSome of this early criticism by black Twitter wasn\u2019t exactly fair, since, unless you\u2019re a fan of his work, judging Trevor Noah\u2019s comedy and progressive chops by his one interview with Tomi Lahren is akin to judging Dave Chappelle by his \u201cGive Trump a chance\u201d monologue on Saturday Night Live and ignoring anything else he\u2019s done in comedy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA week later, when Charlamagne tha God, faux woke comedian and professional troll from the radio show The Breakfast Club, was caught playing Instagram footsie angling for an interview with Lauren, black Twitter called the Drop Squad. Suddenly Charlamagne, and Noah, were sellouts, seduced by a White She-Devil and unwittingly giving a platform to increasingly bold white supremacists in this post-Trump America.\n\nTrevor Noah, relatively new to this game, is being dragged by Twitter for something he never did.\n\nI am a huge fan of Noah\u2019s brand of political humor and have been ever since I saw the documentary about his life, You Laugh but It\u2019s True, at a film festival in 2012. Since he took over The Daily Show in 2015, his critics have accused him of, basically, not being Jon Stewart. Trevor Noah doesn\u2019t embody the East Coast white liberal outrage that other Daily Show alums like John Oliver and Samantha Bee have honed with laserlike efficiency. For black folks wanting searing racial political humor, Larry Wilmore was on Comedy Central for a year picking up the slack. Noah didn\u2019t have the burden of being both black and white America\u2019s political-comedy catharsis.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll of that is different now with the election of white-nationalist-sympathizing Donald Trump. Black people are legitimately scared. In this age of creeping white nationalism, if a liberal host (especially a black one) has a conservative guest, anything short of a gladiator-style verbal evisceration, followed by a slow thumbs-down and a tossing of bloody rhetorical entrails to the audience for sport, is tantamount to collusion with the enemy.\n\nBut that\u2019s not Trevor Noah\u2019s style, and it doesn\u2019t have to be. He\u2019s more Yakov Smirnoff than Paul Mooney. He\u2019s an outsider more bemused than enraged by our politics.\n\nIf there is any criticism I have of Noah in the wake of this fake controversy, it\u2019s that he doesn\u2019t spend enough time sharing how his worldview differs from the audience's. His best comedy is when he flips our flawed democracy into typical politics throughout Africa. As a child, he lived through apartheid, which was like the Batman of white supremacy; it took the best parts of racism from around the world and perfected it \u2026 at the expense of 85 percent of the population for 70 years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust because Noah\u2019s comedy is more driven by the philosophy of the Truth and Reconciliation Committee than our Western notions of getting revenge and getting even doesn\u2019t make him soft on bigotry. Treating Lahren nicely after his show is no worse a crime than my South African colleagues tipping a white waiter in a restaurant that used to not serve blacks. Sometimes you show power by not letting bigots dictate your behavior.\n\nOver the next four (likely eight) years, there will be plenty of white-nationalist-sympathizing conservatives out there, and plenty of black media people who will try to suck up to them. Charlamagne tha God is a professional provocateur who thought he\u2019d get some clicks and some good trolling out of dangling a \u201cpretty white girl\u201d in front of his mostly black audience. But even he realized that he was playing himself.\n\nNoah, who perforated Lahren\u2019s bigotry for 20 minutes, shouldn\u2019t be caught in the crossfire of shade bullets aimed at Charlamagne. He\u2019s bringing good comedy and satire from a perspective that could do us some good in these coming trying times. Perhaps next time, black Twitter should listen to more than his comedy highlights before burying him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJason Johnson, political editor at The Root, is a professor of political science at Morgan State\u2019s School of Global Journalism and Communication and is a frequent guest on MSNBC, CNN, Al-Jazeera International, Fox Business News and SiriusXM Satellite Radio.

I did not sign up to be no political activist.\u201d It\u2019s a sentiment as clear as the color of the sky in Los Angeles on a relatively smogless day.\n\nThe same goes for the rest of the quote: \u201cI wanna talk about my motherf\u2014kin' lean, my best friend dying, the girls that come in and out of my life, the jiggy fashion that I wear, my new inspirations in drugs! I don't wanna talk about no f\u2014king Ferguson and s\u2014t because I don't live over there! I live in f\u2014king Soho and Beverly Hills. I can't relate. I'm in the studio; I'm in these fashion studios; I'm in these bitches' drawers. I'm not doing anything outside of that. That's my life.\u201d\n\nSome of us knew of his 2015 TimeOut interview when it was first published. Despite Rocky\u2019s claim in an interview Wednesday with Power 105.1\u2019s The Breakfast Club, reading the TimeOut interview in full will do little to alleviate any frustrations with his thought process. And before that radio interview, the Harlem rapper, who now lives in \u201cf\u2014king Soho and Beverly Hills,\u201d said something equally clueless while speaking before the Debate Society of Oxford University. During that conversation, Rocky said, \u201cWhy are we exploiting the beef between the urban community and the police force when 60 people got shot on a Friday and Saturday [on a July 2014 holiday weekend] in Chicago in black-on-black crime?\u201d\n\nA$AP Rocky\u2019s issue is not that he was misquoted or that his remarks were received differently than intended; it\u2019s that his words have come back to haunt him several months later. They haunt him because as state-sanctioned violence against black people in this country continues to happen, those who enjoy a platform but do not advocate on behalf of black people are widely viewed as part of the problem. In his more recent radio interview, Rocky did not so much offer clarity about previous comments made as he tried to parse his words.\n\nIn his initial response to the social media pile-on, he took to Twitter to take shots at those finding the TimeOut interview late, though he did now acknowledge \u201call this social injustice makes me f\u2014king sick, tho I\u2019m still no politician.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn The Breakfast Club, he said, \"I feel terrible as a black man, as an American. It's crazy. This Donald Trump s\u2014t \u2026 I just don't understand how they keep saying a dark-skinned n\u2014ga don't like black people.\"\n\nStill, he asked, \u201cHow come black lives only matter when a police officer takes it? It should matter when a black life take it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat said, there was one somewhat better explanation about why he does not speak on police brutality:\n\n\n\nYour favorite rappers today\u2014I don't know if it's [Young] Thug, Future, Drake, anybody\u2014you don't always hear their content being about the political s\u2014t going on or all the other s\u2014t. I feel like, why put me on a pedestal for that, especially when I'm not asking for that? I want to make music, I want to inspire, I want to promote peace because at a time like this, I don't have all the answers. I'm not trying to run for Congress or office. I don't have all the answers. I want to promote prosperity especially for black people, especially for just young people, ambitious people, underprivileged. I'm not here to talk about supremacy, who's dominant. It's f\u2014ked up.\n\nAn inconvenient truth is that, as helpful as it is for each of us\u2014especially those with huge platforms\u2014to advocate on behalf of black people in the wake of what\u2019s happening to so many of us, it is still by and large a choice. Moreover, it is a choice that some may elect to do but are unfortunately not equipped to handle. A$AP Rocky can talk about many things with precision: fashion, his flawless skin, the women he screws, the friends he\u2019s lost along the way and whatever else involves his private life. Unfortunately, as he\u2019s made it painfully clear over and over again, social unrest, police brutality and racism are not his forte.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe people who conflate \u201cblack-on-black crime\u201d with state-sanctioned violence are of the Stacey Dash school of thinking. It is a pool as deep as a wad of spit on a New York City sidewalk on a hot day in July. There are many other celebrities\u2014namely those minority ones who mistakenly invoke \u201cAll Lives Matter\u201d\u2014just like Rocky. They don\u2019t know any better, and while we hope they get better, in the meantime, it\u2019s probably better off for all parties involved if they shut up.\n\nMaybe we shouldn\u2019t put certain celebrities on pedestals and expect more than what they can give intellectually. Even so, if you go out of your way not only to misrepresent the movement but also to lend your black face to a white-contrarian narrative seeking to discount the racism happening in this country, as A$AP Rocky did, then you deserve whatever comes your way.\n\nAct accordingly.\n\nMichael Arceneaux hails from Houston, lives in Harlem and praises Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s name wherever he goes.

If Heaven exists \u2014 and I believe it does \u2014 and what we believe to be true about Heaven is actually true, if she died today she would not be there tomorrow.\n\nShe is also young, petite, and very blonde; characteristics that, in tandem, are considered by very many people to be the three most desirable things a woman can be. If she appeared on screen and the TV happened to be on mute and you happened to not be paying much attention to it, you could easily mistake her for Kristen Bell or Emilia Clarke.\n\nThis \u2014 her appearance and youth and physical presence \u2014 seems to be incongruent with who she actually is. It's not at all, of course. She is, again, a terrible fucking person. (Do not forget this.) But everything America encourages us to believe about how terrible and dangerous people are supposed to look and sound (not like Tomi Lahren) and the type of people people who look like Tomi Lahren are supposed to be (not terrible and dangerous) suggests otherwise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis particular strain of socialization also ignores history. Tomi Lahrens are directly responsible for false arrests, beatings, whippings, lynchings, and even executions. If you watch the footage of Ruby Bridges desegregating William Frantz Elementary, or Ernest Green, Elizabeth Eckford, Jefferson Thomas, Terrence Roberts, Carlotta Walls LaNier Minnijean Brown, Gloria Ray Karlmark, Thelma Mothershed, and Melba Pattillo Beals desegregating Little Rock Central High, you'll see dozens of Tomi Lahrens on the front lines, clutching signs, hurling stones, and spewing hate; their pretty little blonde fucking faces twisted, evil, and cruel.\n\nBut their looks have granted them the privilege of consideration. Sometimes even kindness. (And sometimes even cupcakes.) Because women that young, that blonde, that petite just can't possibly also be that hateful. It's unfathomable that they could genuinely be this vile and wicked. So maybe a conversation might sway them. Or an invitation to a show. Or a hug. Or a drink. Or a date even. Or a dick inside of them. Or, shit, maybe even having a kid with them might do it. It never does, of course. Never, ever, ever, ever, ever. But that doesn't stop us from trying. (If it's not obvious already, \"us\" in this context is \"Black men.\")\n\nWhile both history and the present inform us that we should be impervious to whichever charms we believe they possess \u2014 that our lives can literally depend on refusing to be seduced by them \u2014 we still allow it to happen. We still want to acknowledge and engage them. We still want to be nice to them. Perhaps with the hope that they'll acknowledge and engage us in return. But all this does is validate them. It gives them credibility for engaging us; which, in the eyes of their friends and fans and followers, is effectively and bravely slumming. It promotes their brands and boosts their platforms. It buys them more airtime and unlimited bleach. It provides them an alibi for their hate. Because Tomi Lahren can't really be racist if she's getting drinks with Trevor and mean mugging with Charlamagne. Look how fun she looks!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd when we allow that to happen, we're not brave. We're not sober. We're not attempting to find a common ground. We're not extending an olive branch. We're not being the bigger person. We're not taking one for the team. We're not even genuine.

Cosmetics brand Prescriptives, founded in 1979, rose to prominence in the 1990s with its custom-blended foundations, allowing customers to incorporate their chosen finish and coverage into their custom-matched foundation shade, blended specifically for them.\n\nIt was, at the time, a novel concept and, seemingly, an excellent business concept, too. But it proved not to be a sustainable one; the brand was temporarily shuttered by parent company Est\u00e9e Lauder in 2010, only to be revived as an online-only offering a year later, solely in response to the demand from its still-devoted following.\n\nOf course, the makeup game has changed considerably in the years since, with full-spectrum foundation lines increasingly becoming the expectation rather than the exception. Lines like Make Up Forever, MAC and Color Fx, and even drugstore faves L\u2019Oreal and Maybelline, have increasing expanded their foundation lines to be more inclusive.\n\nBut a month before Fenty Beauty wowed us with a much-lauded 40-color foundation launch, L\u2019Oreal-owned Lanc\u00f4me upped the inclusion ante with Le Teint Particulier, a customizable foundation available in 8,000 shades and 72,000 unique coverage- and moisture-level formulations. It is currently available exclusively at select Nordstrom stores in the U.S.\n\nThe cosmetics behemoth wisely took its show on the road this year to South by Southwest, bringing the customizable experience to the crowds at the annual conference and festival that merges technology, film, music and interactive media. It\u2019s a fitting setting for this tech-forward offering from Lanc\u00f4me, and here\u2019s how it works: A Lanc\u00f4me beauty specialist uses a handheld device called a color spectrometer to scan the client\u2019s bare face in three places. The device bounces light off the skin, \u201creading\u201d the skin tone. The specialist enters those results into a tablet app, coupled with finish preferences, and a custom formula is mixed within minutes\u2014not unlike having paint mixed at your local hardware store.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor an extra-personalized touch, each bottle is labeled with the client\u2019s name and specific shade ID for easy reordering. (L\u2019Oreal says that all identifiable client data is scrubbed after point of purchase, and the resulting anonymous data is used to further product development.)\n\nGuive Balooch, global vice president of L\u2019Oreal\u2019s technology incubator, told AdWeek: \u201cWhen you look at all these companies talking about making more shades, the reality is that there\u2019s way more skin tones than there could ever be in a supply chain. My team, working with engineering firms, created what could only be made in a lab or factory setting right at the point-of-sale.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nL\u2019Oreal\u2019s SkinCeuticals brand is also in on the SXSW action; its Custom DOSE (Diagnostic Optimization Serum Experience) will launch a line of customized face serums, created for dermatologists to use, in June. This process relies on a questionnaire to determine the skin\u2019s specific needs. The answers are again entered into a tablet app, and using 2,000 algorithms, the serum is custom-mixed and labeled for each client.\n\nNow, of course, this level of personalized attention doesn\u2019t come cheap; a 1- ounce bottle of Lanc\u00f4me\u2019s Le Teint Particulier retails for $88, while SkinCeuticals serums currently retail for almost twice that price, on average. So while our curiosity is definitely piqued about the possibility of a couture cosmetic experience, perhaps the real question is, what\u2019s it worth to find your perfect match?", "keywords": ["color", "lines", "experience", "foundation", "customfoundation", "tablet", "makeup", "shows", "skin", "sxsw", "brand", "skills", "teint", "technology", "madetomeasure", "lanc\u00f4me"], "polarity": 0.22110119047619045, "subjectivity": 0.4642261904761905},

She had previously filed a trademark for Aneres in 2003, but that was just for a clothing line.\n\nNow U.S. Patent and Trademark Office docs reveal that she\u2019ll be offering a wide range of beauty products, from skin care, cosmetics and makeup kits to perfumes, lotions and bath soaps. She even filed a trademark for hair-care products, including normal and dry shampoos, hair sprays and hair gels.\n\nPhoto: Pascal Le Segretain (Getty Images)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliams already has a successful clothing line with HSN, which offers a wide-ranging array of looks from fringed cardigans to sports leggings. In fact, if there\u2019s one thing Williams has, it\u2019s range: She\u2019s never shied away from crop tops and bright colors, but also features stunning looks like simple, elegant sleeveless dresses with high necks and flared, pleated skirts.\n\nWith that in mind, it\u2019s no surprise that her beauty trademarks are similarly wide-ranging.

I flew toward those words on Lit Cosmetics\u2019 Lit Metals Metallic Pigment Kit liquid metallic eye shadow box like a moth to a flame\u2014especially after learning that this was the same makeup used to create Oprah\u2019s look for her turn as Mrs. Which in the big-screen fantasy A Wrinkle in Time.\n\nThis water-based formulation makes it easy to use with contacts and safe for lash extensions; it\u2019s also paraben-, glycol- and alcohol-free, and its lightweight but easily buildable coverage makes it perfect for everyday wear (if you dare).\n\nApplication is an easy two-step process. First, dip the brush into the liquid adhesive and apply it to your eyelid, allowing about 30-60 seconds to dry. While it\u2019s still wet, dip the same brush into the pot of glitter\u2014which is ground so fine it looks like a powder\u2014and brush the glitter onto your lids.\n\nVoil\u00e0! The effect is instant, and the gold pigment is likely what you\u2019ve been looking for in a dry or cream shadow but could never find.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPersonally, I felt the liquid adhesive drying and tightening a little for about 15 minutes afterward, and was aware of feeling something on my lids for about a half hour before I got used to the feeling. A few tricks: Avoid the crease of your eye\u2014unless you have ample time to sit with your eyes closed, it\u2019s very difficult for the adhesive to dry in the fold in the lid, and it will feel sticky for long time. If it happens, just moisten a cotton swab with water and wipe it away. Also, make sure to comb your lashes out immediately afterward in case a stray sparkle goes rogue and lands in the base of your lashes.\n\nFor a more dimensional look, you can layer the adhesive and Lit Kit glitter over regular eye shadow. Another easy and quick day-to-night makeup transformation is to use the glitter as a liquid eyeliner\u2014it takes five minutes. For golden lids, Addicted is now my go-to color, and I used Smolder for a sleek and shimmering eyeliner. Lit Kits give you glittery glamour for $28.

Some great moments deserve a sequel, and we\u2019ve therefore done some deep investigative journalism to get the details on our favorite look of Grammy night 2018.\n\nAs previously posted, Eve was our hands-down winner of this year\u2019s awards ceremony, despite not being nominated this year (sorry, Beyonc\u00e9). Thanks to our intrepid, talented and well-connected Gizmodo Media Group family (we\u2019re talking about you, Victor Amos!), we were able to get the scoop on Eve\u2019s incredible Grammys style\u2014and, most important, how to imitate it.\n\nLet\u2019s start with that gorgeous face: Makeup artist Ernesto Casillas has been working with Eve since the promotional tour for Barbershop and counts her among his favorite clients. For her Grammys look, he rose to the occasion while not even knowing what the star would be wearing, as he tells The Glow Up:\n\nFor the look, I knew right away that I wanted to keep it pretty and somewhat classic. We didn\u2019t know exactly what outfit she was going to wear up until right before she went on, so I wanted to keep the colors neutral and paint her in a way that she would feel confident and pretty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe multihyphenate added \u201cred-carpet host\u201d to her title this year, co-hosting the evening\u2019s Grammy Red Carpet Live with Entertainment Tonight\u2019s Nancy O\u2019Dell, Kevin Frazier and Keltie Knight. To make sure the star stayed stellar-looking throughout the day, Casillas had a strategy:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCasillas also wanted to make sure the focus stayed where it belonged while his star was speaking on the red carpet:\n\nEve usually likes to opt for a nude pink lip, but I knew I wanted a midtone lip, since she was wearing a suit and would be interviewing people. I wanted the mouth to also be a focus, but not too dark, either. I lined the lips with a deep berry color and filled in with a lighter, peachier shade. I used Kat Von D\u2019s \u201cLolita\u201d lipstick and some nude gloss over that.\n\nAnd lest we forget that Eve opted to wear not one, but two d\u00e9colletage-baring blazers during the evening, Casillas certainly didn\u2019t, using Gleam Body Bronzing Lotion in shade Deep Gold on her chest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd as for that mane of perfectly tousled waves Eve was rocking over her shoulder? You can thank hairstylist Angela Christine, who\u2019s been working with Eve for over seven years and also styles her for The Talk. Christine tells The Glow Up:\n\nShe\u2019s an amazing person to work with, [and] really makes the job easy. Eve loves strong and effortless, so once she chose the suit, she wanted something that felt relaxed and beautiful at the same time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that deciding on Eve\u2019s style was effortless; Christine was ready for a big chop, but the star felt otherwise. \u201cWe actually went back and forth about the hair. ... I wanted to do a shorter, edgy cut, but she was serious about keeping it long,\u201d Christine says.\n\nAnd as for that color? Christine says that she and Eve have been playing with both warm and cool tones lately, and the honey tone was actually done well in advance. The extensions actually came from Christine\u2019s own line, Conscious Curls, in a texture called Strength, which closely resembles natural hair blown out. \u201cThis [allowed] for lots of fullness and volume, which we both loved,\u201d Christine says.\n\nChristine then used a medium-barrel ceramic curling iron to achieve those gorgeous loose waves, strategically curling in opposite directions for a messier look. She then used Ouai Rose Oil and Kenra Texturizing Taffy to create even more separation and texture.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChristine\u2014who, in addition to working for The Talk, also has a salon in West Hollywood, Calif., and consults for other beauty brands\u2014is releasing a series of affirming children\u2019s books called the Pretty Curls Club.

Hot on the heels of H&M\u2019s absolutely irresponsible and boycott-inducing use of a black boy to market a sweatshirt proclaiming him the \u201cCoolest Monkey in the Jungle,\u201d Italian beauty brand Wycon Cosmetics decided to up the ante.\n\nThe Milan-based beauty company, which touts over 200,000 Instagram followers, apparently thought it\u2019d be a great idea to name its new line of gel polishes after well-known R&B and hip-hop songs, including \u201cDrop It Like It\u2019s Hot,\u201d \u201cCandy Shop\u201d and \u201cBootylicious.\u201d But the company saved the most provocative for last, with its darkest nail color: a true black named \u201cThick as a Nigga.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYeah. For real, for real.\n\nAccording to writer Declan Eytan for Forbes magazine, the polish name was purportedly inspired by the song \u201cThick Nigga\u201d from artist DBangz\u2014an artist with far less popularity than Wycon, but nevertheless deemed an ideal inspirational choice for the brand.\n\n\n\nOK, sure.\n\nWycon\u2019s indelicate choice understandably\u2014and, likely, expectedly\u2014caused an uproar after a now-deleted Instagram post caught the attention of Afro-Italian entertainer and YouTube personality Loretta Grace, who rightly called out the brand on social media. In response to the torrent of criticism unleashed, the company was at first dismissive, telling one commenter, \u201cThey\u2019re made-up names that are a bit crazy\u201d (ahem, they\u2019re not \u201cmade-up\u201d if you use actual song names). But as outrage mounted, the company offered the type of tepid and tone-deaf response we\u2019ve now become all too accustomed to:\n\nWe\u2019re sorry that this post has triggered these types of reactions: every color from our Gel On collection is inspired, with a cheerful attitude and a pinch of naivety, by famous song titles, many of which derive from the landscape of hip hop . . . Wycon is the brand for everybody #nobodyexcluded is our motto and we didn\u2019t mean to offend anybody!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWycon has since scrubbed all Gel On nail polish names from its website, after undoubtedly getting the attention it wanted\u2014attention we\u2019re admittedly reluctant to add to. But in light of the well-publicized series of similar transgressions by major brands that have preceded this one, we highly doubt that the brand didn\u2019t mean to offend. In fact, we don\u2019t think Wycon cared at all, as evidenced by the response Loretta Grace received from the Italian beauty community, as told to Allure magazine:\n\nMy community was shocked about it . . . But most of the Italian beauty community said that I am exaggerating and that a lot of American rappers and singers like Nicki Minaj and Beyonc\u00e9 say the N* word on their songs so we cannot complain about it. SMDH.\n\nClearly, our shock and awe has become as marketable as our culture (we\u2019d personally love to see the brand get slapped with licensing suits for using those song names). Because in 2018, there is absolutely no excuse for this type of racial insensitivity from a cosmetics brand (or any other), other than a sheer lack of\u2014well, you know. So it\u2019s another day, another insult\u2014and ultimately, we just have one less brand to check for. Because one thing obviously hasn\u2019t hit the Italian beauty market yet, and that\u2019s the importance of the black dollar.

And we can\u2019t breathe one word about that evening\u2019s red carpet without acknowledging our current and forever #Fave, Yara Shahidi. Like, we may have to come up with a concept stronger than #Goals to explain how we feel about her.\n\n\n\nWhen the 17-year-old shining star stepped on that SAG Awards red carpet, we collectively gasped\u2014and haven\u2019t taken a breath since. She snatched every one of our wigs that night, from her full, flowing mane and face glossed by Chanel all the way to the trailing train of her custom Ralph Lauren jumpsuit. And we can\u2019t forget to mention the exaggerated back bow detail that added the perfect touch of whimsy to an otherwise sophisticated silhouette. Every single thing was right about that look.\n\nPersonally, I just had to know the details of her beyond-glam makeup and to-the-heavens hair. After a little cyber searching, I came across the two boss babes responsible for Yara\u2019s carpet-crushing hair and makeup. After doing some gushing about the magic they created, I was able to tease out step-by-step instructions on how to re-create the textured tresses and flawless makeup from the red carpet\u2014product details and all!\n\n\n\nHairstylist to the stars Nai\u2019vasha Johnson is the real deal, having magnified the manes of many of our celebrity faves, including Zendaya, Uzo Aduba, songbirds (and Yara\u2019s Grown-ish co-stars) Chloe x Halle, Dear White People\u2019s Logan Browning and Chewing Gum\u2019s Michaela Coel. Represented by Exclusive Artists Management, this celebrity hairstylist is a master, whether working with wigs and extensions, braided works of art or textured tresses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith all of this talent, Johnson is more than just a hair expert. She has often spoken up in support of female-focused platforms, as well as addressing some of the pressures put on black women to alter their hair for cultural approval. For this mother of two daughters\u2014one who has decided to keep her hair natural and another with a relaxer\u2014the priority is on healthy hair and a woman\u2019s right to choose and not feel pressured to conform. Her focus is healthy hair, in whatever form that means for any woman she is working with.\n\nTo achieve Yara\u2019s showstopping look last Sunday, Johnson used products from natural-hair-care maven Taliah Waajid. Johnson says: \u201cThe inspiration was glamorous Diana Ross. I wanted her beautiful texture delicately brushed out.\u201d\n\nJohnson graciously gave us a detailed step-by-step on how she created Yara\u2019s blown-out brown bombshell style for the SAG Awards:\n\nSaturate damp hair from root to tip with the Taliah Waajid Green Apple and Aloe Nutrition Leave-In Conditioner. Brush hair thoroughly with a boar-bristle brush to evenly distribute the product. Dry hair with a diffuser. Add a quarter size of Taliah Waajid Curly Curl Cream to define curls and add shine. Brush out hair with a boar-bristle brush to Diana Ross-esque perfection!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow on to Yara\u2019s flawlessly painted face, courtesy of celebrity makeup artist Emily Cheng. Her makeup masterpieces have been seen on red carpets and editorial pages for years. She is also responsible for many of Yara\u2019s fresh looks that we\u2019ve been swooning over recently.\n\nUsing all Chanel Beauty products, Cheng chose the matchless mix of deep-wine lips and high shine on the lids to complement the chic strapless, tuxedo-inspired gown-turned-jumpsuit made exclusively for Yara.\n\nHere is Cheng\u2019s full beauty breakdown of the Chanel products she used to achieve Yara\u2019s glossy glow:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrep Products\n\nEye Essentials\n\nCritical for Cheeks\n\nLip List\n\nSo there you have it: We can all now be one step closer to Yara Shahidi shine ... which was definitely at the top of my 2018 resolutions.

The fashion world\u2019s first black female megastar makeup artist is both a consummate artist and the creative genius and businesswoman behind Pat McGrath Labs. Vogue has called her \u201cthe most influential makeup artist in the world,\u201d and there\u2019s not a face that has graced its covers that she hasn\u2019t made blossom with her particular brand of magic\u2014as demonstrated on beauties like Naomi Campbell, Joan Smalls, Duckie Thot and Oprah Winfrey.\n\nBoth Fortune 500 companies and fans from Moscow to Rio de Janeiro clamor for McGrath\u2019s services for fashion shoots and product-development consultations. In 1999 she developed designer Giorgio Armani\u2019s makeup line\u2014in my opinion, still one of the top three foundation formulations and shade ranges on the market. In 2004 she was named creative director of Procter & Gamble cosmetics, which includes lines like SK-II, Dolce & Gabbana and CoverGirl. In 2013 Queen Elizabeth II named McGrath an MBE, or Member of the Order of the British Empire, for services to the fashion and beauty industries.\n\nMcGrath finally founded her own eponymous collection in 2015 based around highly pigmented lipsticks and eye shadows. Without fail, lines around the block accompany each new limited edition launch at her freestanding New York City store, and within hours, her website sells out of her flawlessly curated $125 eye shadow palettes and $38 lipsticks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI worked with McGrath and her team a month ago for the British Fashion Awards and still missed my chance to score the last two offerings of her Matte Trance lipstick and new Lip Fetish lip balm. But my hope is that these lipsticks will make their way into a Sephora near me sometime soon because thankfully, McGrath has heard our cries for more, making a 61-piece \u201cUnlimited\u201d collection available at the beauty retailer last October. It was a beauty junkie\u2019s dream come true!\n\nCome Jan. 18, get ready to shop her next drop. \u201cPrepare to panic!\u201d teases McGrath, to alert us that Mother will soon be sending down the Mothership IV: Decadence eye shadow palette from her lab. So here\u2019s my advice on how to get yours: Log on to Sephora.com at 12 p.m. EST on Jan. 18; on Jan. 19, you can head to select Sephora stores. McGrath has timed the release of these shades so that her fans can use the same makeup she\u2019ll be using during February\u2019s Milan Fashion Week. She\u2019s also in keeping with the latest retail trend of \u201cbuy now, wear now\u201d\u2014but only if you can get it!", "keywords": ["services", "shadow", "artist", "makeup", "jan", "eye", "beauty", "soon", "pat", "mogul", "fashion", "mother", "mcgrath", "come"], "polarity": 0.18513162234590808, "subjectivity": 0.4745823541537827},

Blige\u2019s glow up this awards season; in fact, we\u2019re not sure we\u2019ve stanned this hard for her since What\u2019s the 411? The singer and actress has been nominated for Golden Globe, Critics Choice and Screen Actors Guild awards, and now a history-making two Oscar nods for both her performance and original song in Dee Rees\u2019 Mudbound. And she has stunned us on every single red carpet.\n\nBut those stunning looks have a secret weapon in a longtime member of Blige\u2019s team: celebrity makeup artist D\u2019Andre Michael. Knowing how much we wanted the 411 on Blige\u2019s super-fly SAG Awards look, Michael let The Glow Up in on a surprisingly low-priced secret: He exclusively used products from Black Opal.\n\nYes, THAT Black Opal (its Instagram is kind of poppin\u2019, by the way). In Michael\u2019s words:\n\nI\u2019ve been working with Mary J. Blige for years, and I love trying new looks on her. I wanted to create a showstopping look using Black Opal for her first-time appearance at the SAG Awards. Once I saw her gown, I knew I wanted to transform her into an elegant smoked goddess.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe was smokin\u2019 indeed, styled by fashion fave Law Roach in a one-shouldered black-and-white gown with a dramatic wing motif by designer Jean-Louis Sabaji.\n\nMichael, who\u2019s been on Blige\u2019s team for over a decade, complemented her dress and sleek modern hairstyle with a perfect smoky eye atop glowing skin, using Black Opal all the way. He shared with The Glow Up why, after years of working with the superstar, this awards season is such a special one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up: As a longtime member of Mary J. Blige\u2019s team, what\u2019s it like to work with her during this groundbreaking phase of her career?\n\nD\u2019Andre Michael: Having been with Mary J. Blige now for 11 years, we are more like family. I am so proud and honored to be a part of this moment with her. I\u2019m happy and overjoyed with her continued success, but this is like the stepping-stone to something I know she has been passionate [about]. It\u2019s amazing to see the acknowledgment and praise she is receiving for her work as an actress. I\u2019m like a proud brother.\n\nTGU: Mary\u2019s looks have been phenomenal at every event. How are you able to keep her looks so fresh?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDM: I have been with her every step of the way: Every award show, every red carpet, press junket, television show, etc. It\u2019s always been my thing to make her look good every time.\n\nMaybe because she\u2019s on a different platform now, a broader audience is taking note, but nothing has changed much with what we do. It\u2019s being there as a support for her in all that she\u2019s going through personally, making sure her spirits are up and she feels good about herself and comfortable with how she looks, what she\u2019s wearing, etc. So I think what shines through mostly is her \u201chappy\u201d\u2014and when you feel good internally, it shows externally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: You used exclusively Black Opal for Mary\u2019s SAG Awards look. Tell us why we should be checking for drugstore brands, and why Black Opal works so well for our tones?\n\nDM: I have never been one to follow trends or fads, mainly because trends come and go, and fads fade away. However, staying true to myself as an artist and finding things that work for me to use on my clients is most important. That\u2019s above any brand\u2014whether it is department store, drugstore or specialty store.\n\nI have learned just because something has a name brand on it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s suitable for what I need to use it for. Therefore, it is all about the quality of a product, and sometimes the most expensive product isn\u2019t necessarily the best. A lot of my favorite go-to products are drugstore brands.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy friend Sam Fine worked with Black Opal years ago and helped them with their colors and palettes. Even then, I realized It was a brand that I could trust, because he\u2019s an amazing artist that I respect and call a friend. So if Sam trusts them, I know I can.\n\nDM: Black Opal has always been a staple for having a great color range for women of color; from the fairest of women to the darkest, you could trust you are in good hands with the Black Opal brand, and the formula is great. It gives great coverage that you could work with, whether you need a light coverage to a complete coverage. The Black Opal True Color Skin Perfecting Stick Foundation is amazing! It is great to see they are still around and providing women of color and us professionals with great colors and a great formula.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: At 47, Mary looks incredible. Can you talk about how makeup differs for women in her age group?\n\nDM: The only difference is probably the fads and trends you may want to stay away from with a more mature woman. In terms of looks, you definitely want to use less powder and more products that enhance a dewier look.\n\nFor eyes, most to all women can carry a smoky eye. Many think \u201csmoky eye,\u201d and they think black or dark. But you can smoke your eyes with almost any color.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn terms of skin, I like to do my concealer, then apply my foundation, next set with a powder, and maybe spritz your face with a mister or the Evian mist spray to infuse the powder and foundation. Next, let it air-dry to take away the powdered look so you have more of a dewy skin appearance.\n\nIlluminators work as well, but know that sometimes these can come across drab and chalky looking if you use the wrong color. For women of color, I recommend an illuminator in the flesh-tone range (bronzy or mauve, etc.), and stay away from pearl color or yellows or orange-based colors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, even after all that great advice, we couldn\u2019t let Michael go without getting his step-by-step for creating Blige\u2019s SAG look, and all the products he used. How else are we going to plan for our next shopping trip?\n\nFor the Face\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the Eyes\n\nTo sculpt and define Blige\u2019s eyes, Michael used the Black Opal Aurora Eyeshadow Palette. First, he used the Brazen Copper shade on her entire eyelid. Next, he added Brazen Bronze on her crease, adding the Bordeaux Beige shade along the brow bone as a highlight.\n\n\n\nMichael then finished the eye look with Black Opal Color Splurge Automatic Eye Lining Pencil in Licorice, adding it along the lash line and inner lid and smudging to create a smoky look. Note: This eye pencil is formulated with aloe vera and chamomile extracts that help to soothe the delicate eye area as you define it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Lasting Lip\n\nFor the finishing touches to Blige\u2019s look, Michael used Black Opal Lip Color Splurge Stick Lip in Purr, a soft, pale-pink color enriched with emollient butters and vitamins C&E. This lipstick provides a bright, pigment-rich color that provides a smooth, creamy, nondrying finish.\n\nNo word yet on what Blige\u2019s look will be for the 90th Academy Awards on March 4. But even after Michael works his magic, we know the finishing touch will really be Mary J. Blige\u2019s happiness.

Rihanna came\u2014ferociously\u2014for all of our coins with the launch of Fenty Beauty. Flat-tummy teas were the rage of the year for Instagram celebrities. And we could not get enough of banana powder.\n\n\n\nHowever, there are a few beauty trends in 2017 that should stay right where they are. In fact, we should tar and feather them. I would even be willing to leave them at the gates of hell if this would ensure that I\u2019d never see them again. I\u2019m counting down to a new year hopefully free of these trends:\n\n5. Brazilian Butt Lifts on Spaghetti Legs\n\nWe\u2019ve all seen those perfectly round, plump backsides on our favorite A- through D-list celebrities. No need to name names; we know who they are. They perfectly fill out all of their dresses, but in a bikini or jeans, it\u2019s a different\u2014and bleak\u2014story. We bore witness to spaghetti legs damn near snapping in half under the weight of these plentiful posteriors.\n\nMy prayer for 2018 is to bring balance and a proper ass-to-thigh ratio back to the game. Amen.\n\n4. Baby Hairs\n\nWhether they\u2019re on a lace front or from your own glorious mane (insert hand claps), RETIRE THE BABY HAIRS. It\u2019s called \u201cbaby hair\u201d for a reason, baby. If you are over the age of 5, there\u2019s no reason you should be channeling your inner Ginuwine with a toothbrush and edge control.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but if you have \u201cbaby hair,\u201d your edges are probably struggling.\n\n3. Unnatural-Looking Brows\n\nBrows are natural frames for the face. I\u2019ve had a difficult time this year trying to figure out why sisters keep doing the most with their cejas. If it wasn\u2019t the \u201combre eyebrow\u201d\u2014or \u201chombre eyebrows,\u201d as I like to call them\u2014that faded at the inside of the bridge of the nose, it was a whole-ass lace front for your brows. Bruh. Ma\u2019am. Chile. Huh?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAre we really putting somebody else\u2019s hair on top of our brows? I absolutely understand; not everyone is blessed with a well-grown brow, but we have to do better. Microblade them or something. Ugh.\n\n2. The Goofy Gold Highlight on the Tip of the Nose\n\nI L-O-V-E a good ole glistening highlight! Cheeks that serve glowing, dewy realness give me the feels every time. I partake in a lively glowfest when I apply makeup. But what I\u2019m not finna do\u2014yes, finna\u2014is do that ill-placed gold dot on the tip of my nose made popular by Instagram makeup artists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMakeup should look natural\u2014or at least try. There is NOTHING NATURAL about a gold polka dot on your face that\u2019s not blended into the skin. It literally sits atop the nose like luminescent doo-doo.\n\nHighlighters, when used correctly, should cast a radiant shine onto the high points of the face when hit by natural light. Anything else is uncivilized. You cannot slay this way. I\u2019m sorry to say.\n\nAnd finally ... (Drumroll.)\n\n1. The Odd-Color-Lipstick Phase\n\nWe were bombarded by lips wearing teal, navy, green, gray, yellow, royal blue, aqua and a plethora of other Crayola colors [Editor\u2019s note: See Fenty\u2019s recent Mattemoiselle release]. Usually it was super-matchy and not very well executed. While I did see some some sisters rocking the hell out of these audacious/atrocious color palettes, for the most part, chicks just looked like they were ready to enjoy the finest Krabby Patty at the Krusty Krab in Bikini Bottom.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust, NO.\n\nWith 2018 quickly approaching, we need to start the year off right. So, until next time, remember: Friends don\u2019t let friends leave the house looking crazy.\n\n*Besos.*", "keywords": ["2017", "nose", "trends", "natural", "women", "hair", "face", "beauty", "gold", "im", "tip", "spaghetti", "baby", "black", "leave"], "polarity": 0.0801012876012876, "subjectivity": 0.5002537740037739},

Hot on the heels of H&M\u2019s absolutely irresponsible and boycott-inducing use of a black boy to market a sweatshirt proclaiming him the \u201cCoolest Monkey in the Jungle,\u201d Italian beauty brand Wycon Cosmetics decided to up the ante.\n\nThe Milan-based beauty company, which touts over 200,000 Instagram followers, apparently thought it\u2019d be a great idea to name its new line of gel polishes after well-known R&B and hip-hop songs, including \u201cDrop It Like It\u2019s Hot,\u201d \u201cCandy Shop\u201d and \u201cBootylicious.\u201d But the company saved the most provocative for last, with its darkest nail color: a true black named \u201cThick as a Nigga.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYeah. For real, for real.\n\nAccording to writer Declan Eytan for Forbes magazine, the polish name was purportedly inspired by the song \u201cThick Nigga\u201d from artist DBangz\u2014an artist with far less popularity than Wycon, but nevertheless deemed an ideal inspirational choice for the brand.\n\n\n\nOK, sure.\n\nWycon\u2019s indelicate choice understandably\u2014and, likely, expectedly\u2014caused an uproar after a now-deleted Instagram post caught the attention of Afro-Italian entertainer and YouTube personality Loretta Grace, who rightly called out the brand on social media. In response to the torrent of criticism unleashed, the company was at first dismissive, telling one commenter, \u201cThey\u2019re made-up names that are a bit crazy\u201d (ahem, they\u2019re not \u201cmade-up\u201d if you use actual song names). But as outrage mounted, the company offered the type of tepid and tone-deaf response we\u2019ve now become all too accustomed to:\n\nWe\u2019re sorry that this post has triggered these types of reactions: every color from our Gel On collection is inspired, with a cheerful attitude and a pinch of naivety, by famous song titles, many of which derive from the landscape of hip hop . . . Wycon is the brand for everybody #nobodyexcluded is our motto and we didn\u2019t mean to offend anybody!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWycon has since scrubbed all Gel On nail polish names from its website, after undoubtedly getting the attention it wanted\u2014attention we\u2019re admittedly reluctant to add to. But in light of the well-publicized series of similar transgressions by major brands that have preceded this one, we highly doubt that the brand didn\u2019t mean to offend. In fact, we don\u2019t think Wycon cared at all, as evidenced by the response Loretta Grace received from the Italian beauty community, as told to Allure magazine:\n\nMy community was shocked about it . . . But most of the Italian beauty community said that I am exaggerating and that a lot of American rappers and singers like Nicki Minaj and Beyonc\u00e9 say the N* word on their songs so we cannot complain about it. SMDH.\n\nClearly, our shock and awe has become as marketable as our culture (we\u2019d personally love to see the brand get slapped with licensing suits for using those song names). Because in 2018, there is absolutely no excuse for this type of racial insensitivity from a cosmetics brand (or any other), other than a sheer lack of\u2014well, you know. So it\u2019s another day, another insult\u2014and ultimately, we just have one less brand to check for. Because one thing obviously hasn\u2019t hit the Italian beauty market yet, and that\u2019s the importance of the black dollar.

Because not only the pageant world, but the beauty industry as a whole has been making some major progress toward diversity.\n\nGIF\n\nEarly last fall, mega-brand CoverGirl shed its classic \u201cEasy, breezy, beautiful\u201d slogan for a fiercer campaign: \u201cI am what I make up.\u201d The brand also ushered in six new badass ambassadors\u2014including Issa Rae\u2014who bring their new mission of inclusivity front and center. And no current beauty conversation would be complete without mentioning Rihanna\u2019s September launch of Fenty Beauty. The launch shook the beauty community to its core, not only breaking the internet but also dispelling some long-held myths surrounding black women and makeup.\n\nSo why, in this melanin-winning back-to-back, inclusivity-embracing, post-Fenty era, are major brands still launching half-assed, lame attempts at diversity?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast week, Tarte Cosmetics, a popular brand known for its cult favorite Shape Tape concealer, launched the highly anticipated Shape Tape foundation. For weeks, Tarte built up the hype for the release with teaser emails and clickbait posts. So imagine the disappointment when thousands of followers flocked to the site, credit card in hand, ready to purchase, only to discover 13 shades of beige and two shades formulated for \u201cricher skintones.\u201d Swatches pictured online were tweeted and retweeted relentlessly.\n\nThe dragging that ensued on Tarte\u2019s timeline was not only epic but truly entertaining. The company eventually had to disable both its Instagram and Twitter comments in an attempt to silence all the negative publicity. Days after throwing shade at Fenty, rationalizing, doubling down on its stance and ignoring its customer base didn\u2019t work, the brand finally relented by posting a response to the outrage on Popsugar, promising more shades to come in the near future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn interesting post from POPSUGAR Beauty. Check it out! Read more Read\n\nBut by then it was already too late. Beauty influencers like Jackie Aina, Makeupshayla and Alissa Ashley took to their social media accounts and promptly got to roasting. It was so delicious, I almost stopped the videos to go grab marshmallows from the kitchen (every good roast has marshmallows).\n\n\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it\u2019s sad, really. Women of color have long been conditioned by makeup brands to be OK with being an afterthought. These manufacturers put little to no effort into the formulation of our shades, or the inclusion of more-diverse models. Instead, we\u2019ve typically been told:\n\n\n\nWomen of color typically don\u2019t invest in luxury makeup brands, meaning those shades don\u2019t sell.\n\n\n\nDeeper shades are more difficult to formulate.\n\n\n\nRicher colors will come out in future launches. We want to see how the product tests in the market first.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd in the past, we\u2019ve accepted these excuses as fact \u2026 until Fenty proved that the rhetoric was wrong:\n\n\n\nWomen of color historically didn\u2019t buy expensive brands because the three shitty shades you offered didn\u2019t match or wear well. As one Twitter user stated, \u201cif you only offer red, red as hell and what the hell, I\u2019m going to opt out.\u201d I can get the same horrible look with drugstore brands. I\u2019ll keep my $40. THANKS.\n\n\n\nIf you can formulate deeper eye shadow, lipstick and bronzer shades, then it stands to reason that foundation shades are not that much different. You employ chemists. Why am I mixing shades in my bathroom to try to get a perfect match? I\u2019m not Walter White.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGIF\n\nWhy should we have to wait for a future launch when the Christian Grey-worthy 50 shades of beige you just released could have been cut in half, and replaced with five to 10 deeper shades with golden, olive and neutral undertones?\n\n\n\nIn the end, it basically all comes down to one thing: SHADE.\n\nUnfortunately, Tarte just so happens to be the company that took the dragging this go-round, but far too many brands continue to operate in this manner. I remember rushing out and purchasing the Laura Mercier Translucent Loose Setting Powder, after hearing dozens of girls rave about how it \u201cdoesn\u2019t add color,\u201d has zero flashback in pictures and sets your makeup to perfection. Lies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe powder is stark white. It not only adds a white cast, but if you\u2019re any darker than Denise Huxtable, it\u2019ll have you looking casket ready, if you\u2019re not careful. That was at least five years ago. The brand JUST came out with ONE chocolate-girl-friendly shade last year.\n\n\n\nWomen of color are no longer being silent about their discontent. The bar has been raised, and your three obligatory WOC-friendly shades\u2014chestnut, mahogany and espresso\u2014are no longer going to cut it. We\u2019re not only vocally speaking out, but we\u2019re also speaking with our dollars. We\u2019re supporting brands that support us, because companies will continue to think it\u2019s OK to underrepresent WOC until we show them otherwise. And we can show them otherwise.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n", "keywords": ["color", "fenty", "excluding", "going", "tarte", "brand", "makeup", "shades", "beauty", "brands", "beige", "50", "launch"], "polarity": 0.05741824031149873, "subjectivity": 0.5061870214679204},

In 1999 she developed designer Giorgio Armani\u2019s makeup line\u2014in my opinion, still one of the top three foundation formulations and shade ranges on the market. In 2004 she was named creative director of Procter & Gamble cosmetics, which includes lines like SK-II, Dolce & Gabbana and CoverGirl. In 2013 Queen Elizabeth II named McGrath an MBE, or Member of the Order of the British Empire, for services to the fashion and beauty industries.\n\nMcGrath finally founded her own eponymous collection in 2015 based around highly pigmented lipsticks and eye shadows. Without fail, lines around the block accompany each new limited edition launch at her freestanding New York City store, and within hours, her website sells out of her flawlessly curated $125 eye shadow palettes and $38 lipsticks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI worked with McGrath and her team a month ago for the British Fashion Awards and still missed my chance to score the last two offerings of her Matte Trance lipstick and new Lip Fetish lip balm. But my hope is that these lipsticks will make their way into a Sephora near me sometime soon because thankfully, McGrath has heard our cries for more, making a 61-piece \u201cUnlimited\u201d collection available at the beauty retailer last October.

So here\u2019s my advice on how to get yours: Log on to Sephora.com at 12 p.m. EST on Jan. 18; on Jan. 19, you can head to select Sephora stores. McGrath has timed the release of these shades so that her fans can use the same makeup she\u2019ll be using during February\u2019s Milan Fashion Week.

I couldn\u2019t find a caramel-colored bra for the life of me, so I decided to get a white bra and attempt to dye it brown, or the closest color I could get to caramel. You see, if you were a brown-skinned woman, the nudes sold in department stores just weren\u2019t going to cut it. Needless to say, my brown-skin-color bra didn\u2019t really come out that great, and I was left with a mess in the dormitory bathroom.\n\nYears later, the quest for the perfect matching nude for women with tan or brown skin is still an issue. And in 2015, when Nubian Skin founder Ade Hassan launched her brand, it was because she decided it was time for \u201ca different kind of nude.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI came up with the idea in 2011. I was working and in consulting at the time, but I always wanted to do something entrepreneurial. A frequent problem that I had was ... when I wanted to wear hosiery that was my skin color. I think any black woman or woman of color usually crossed their fingers when they saw brown tights, but when they get them home, they were ashy,\u201d Hassan told The Root.\n\nIt was then that Hassan decided to take nude matters into her own hands, and in 2013 she started to trademark the company and flesh out a business plan.\n\n\u201cWe launched in 2014, and our campaign went viral in August that year. The reception over the last couple of years has been pretty amazing. Personally, I\u2019m grateful to black women who saw those images and reposted and retweeted and shouted about it so much that mainstream media finally picked it up,\u201d Hassan said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCurrently, Nubian Skin consists of lingerie and hosiery and, now, nude shoes that include heels and ballet flats. Not only can you find the products on the company\u2019s site, but Hassan\u2019s products are also at major retailers like Nordstrom and online at ASOS.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe shoes are online only, and it was just another thing where people went, like, \u2018OMG, I can finally have a nude for me,\u2019\u201d Hassan noted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe popularity of Nubian Skin has consistently risen over the last couple of years, but when it comes to other nude products that specifically cater to women of color, there\u2019s still a definite disconnect in the beauty and fashion industries. Sure, Christian Louboutin has a line of nude shoes, but can the average person randomly drop $875 for a pair of shoes, just to find the perfect brown? Of course not, but you don\u2019t have to with Nubian Skin around. With prices ranging from $94 to $124, you\u2019re not going to miss a car payment just to look fashionable.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say that Hassan, who could be considered a veteran in the nude game for women of color, has paved the way for other entrepreneurs looking to cater to those with brown skin. And in the world of cosmetics, where black women collectively spend an estimated $7.5 billion annually, you can\u2019t really say there are a lot of options out there if you want a nude look, especially when it comes to lipstick and nail polish. But that\u2019s where Mented Cosmetics hopes to fill the void.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMented Cosmetics is the brainchild of Harvard Business School graduates K.J. Miller and Amanda E. Johnson, and currently consists of nude lipsticks and nail polishes catering to women of color and our version of \u201cnude.\u201d\n\nMiller, who comes from a retail background, met Johnson at Harvard, from which they both graduated in 2014. Johnson, who has an investment banking background, said that the two women launched Mented last fall.\n\n\u201cWe knew we wanted to do a start-up together in business school. We just clicked,\u201d explains Johnson. \u201cAnd after school, we would meet up, and with my digital background and her retail background, we knew we were well suited for a company.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring a random conversation about makeup and beauty hacks, Johnson said they both realized that nudes for brown women were missing\u2014and that\u2019s how the idea came about.\n\n\u201cThere was something missing in the market for women of color when it came to nude lipsticks. It\u2019s something that should be a part of every woman\u2019s beauty routine, but it was missing,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nAfter heading to Sephora to try to see what it offered women of color in nude\u2014products that didn\u2019t include manipulating brown lip liner and pink lipstick to make it happen\u2014the women knew how important making a nude lipstick line was.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen it came to the research and development, Miller and Johnson were hands on.\n\n\u201cWe went to every makeup counter asking for nude lip, but they couldn\u2019t do it. So we said, \u2018OK, let\u2019s see if we can do it on our own,\u2019\u201d Miller said.\n\n\u201cWe then reached out to manufacturers all over the East Coast, explaining our concept and wanting to create nude shades for women of color, but they didn\u2019t get it. They wanted us to pick from their stock colors. But there were these pale pinks and super-dark browns. We taught ourselves how to make lipsticks with the aid of the internet. We crafted every single shade in our line,\u201d Miller said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd for those wondering, Mented lipsticks, which sell for $16.50, are vegan, paraben-free, nontoxic and cruelty free and proudly made in the USA.\n\nBy now you\u2019ve probably seen Mented posts on Facebook and Instagram, and the company has received praises for its products.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMiller, Johnson and Hassan didn\u2019t wait for someone else to make products that cater to them; they took matters into their own hands.\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to business, social media plays a huge role nowadays. Hassan noted that it\u2019s easier for people to launch their brands without spending a lot of money because you can easily develop a social media following.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really lucky in this day and age, because historically, it\u2019s been hard if you didn\u2019t have the money to advertise on TV or magazines, if you didn\u2019t have thousands or millions of dollars. Nowadays, with social media, you just need great images that are true to your brand,\u201d Hassan says. \u201cYou just need your phone and images; that\u2019s it. Be on social media and use it to your advantage. Use it to your advantage. You just need your phone.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMented used Instagram to their benefit by sending their products to influencers to garner feedback, which Miller says has been great.\n\n\u201cCustomers really enjoy feeling and being prioritized by a beauty brand,\u201d Miller said.\n\nCurrently, Mented has nine lipsticks and three nail polishes, but they plan on launching more products.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe feel Mented is a full-fledged beauty brand. This fall we\u2019ll be releasing lip gloss, and next year we\u2019ll move on to eyes and cheeks. We\u2019re going to introduce eye shadow palettes as well as blush and highlighter. From there, it\u2019ll be full face,\u201d Miller said.\n\nWith Nubian Skin and Mented Cosmetics giving women of color more options, you will probably see larger companies popping up with their own versions. But when you have companies that are for us and by us and are paving the way, I at least know who\u2019s going to get my coins.", "keywords": ["color", "browns", "comes", "johnson", "women", "hassan", "miller", "mented", "nude", "skin", "nudes", "beauty", "brown", "fashion", "didnt"], "polarity": 0.14523956496178714, "subjectivity": 0.4843601802861061},

The details that have emerged\u2014Meek\u2019s arrest when he was 19 for a bogus crack charge by a crooked cop, the ensuing years of probation under the eyes of a petty and overbearing judge, the returns to prison under the slightest infractions\u2014might beggar belief: How could such bad lack befall one man?\n\nBut it\u2019s not bad luck. It\u2019s simultaneously intentional and random, the damage of one unlawful, violent arrest compounded over a decade. As Rolling Stone lays out in an exclusive interview with the incarcerated rapper, Meek is fighting a daily struggle to keep his mind and spirit free as his lawyers fight for his release on the outside. Writer Paul Solotaroff also burnishes receipts, capturing in excruciating detail 15 years of aggressions committed against Robert Rihmeek Williams by the Philadelphia legal system.\n\nBelow are some of the highlights.\n\nMeek on letting his family visit him in jail:\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t let them come,\u201d he says of his family, a huge and intensely close tribe in Philadelphia, about 15 miles east of these walls. \u201cIf they see me like this \u2013 fucked-up beard, hair all ganked \u2013 then it\u2019s like I\u2019m really in here. Which I\u2019m not.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbout Meek\u2019s initial arrest:\n\nThere\u2019s no forensic proof that Meek was in court that day, but at least he has witnesses. That\u2019s more than can be said for [officer] Reggie Graham, who either didn\u2019t lab-test the crack \u201cseized,\u201d or the lab test never made its way to court. All he had was his word that the alleged substance was coke; Graham claimed he\u2019d done a \u201cfield test\u201d at the scene. According to multiple legal experts, that missing evidence should have been grounds for an instant mistrial; it was the basis for the warrant and Meek\u2019s arrest. \ufeff\n\n\n\nOfficer Reggie Graham, of course, would later be revealed as having his name on a blacklist, compiled by the Philadelphia district attorney, of cops considered too dishonest or corrupt to take the stand at criminal trials.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn that first conviction:\n\nMeek waived a jury trial \u2013 it costs thousands more in legal fees \u2013 so [Judge Genece] Brinkley decided the case. She acquitted Meek\u2019s co-defendants, then found Meek guilty of seven charges \u2013 four involving the gun. There\u2019s no arguing that Meek had a gun on him; he took the stand and admitted so himself. But in Philly, illegal carry is a misdemeanor, typically punished with a fine and house arrest. Instead, he got two years in a county prison and eight years of strict probation \u2013 all because Graham swore he\u2019d seen him sell drugs and aim a weapon at cops.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn how Judge Genece Brinkley responded to Meek\u2019s success:\n\nIncensed about the change in Meek\u2019s travel plans, Brinkley hauled him in for a drug test.

Kelly\u2019s ex-girlfriends has come forward in a Rolling Stone article with new allegations of sexual, emotional and physical abuse against the R&B singer.\n\nKitti Jones, a former radio DJ, cataloged the entire dizzying, two-year relationship with the \u201cPied Piper\u201d of R&B to the magazine, describing how they met (at an after-party following his Dallas concert), his \u201ccourteous courtship\u201d of her, and the escalating incidents of abusive behavior that came to characterize their relationship.\n\nThe story follows a blockbuster BuzzFeed report from Jim DeRogatis, who has followed sexual abuse allegations against Robert Kelly for decades. That story details multiple claims that Kelly held women against their will in a \u201ccult.\u201d Jones was among DeRogatis\u2019 sources.\n\nBelow are some of the most troubling, brutal allegations from Jones, according to the report:\n\nOn meeting R. Kelly at a hotel for the first time:\n\n\u201cI got there before he did because he of course doesn\u2019t like to fly, so he\u2019s taking the bus,\u201d Jones says. She had sent Kelly \u201cracy photos\u201d while he was en route to the hotel and was excited to reunite face-to-face. As she waited in the hotel room for Kelly to arrive, she heard a knock at the door. \u201cHe brushed past me,\u201d Jones says. \u201cI\u2019m thinking we\u2019re going to hug or peck each other. But he plopped down on the couch and pulled out his penis and started pleasuring himself.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJones told Rolling Stone she was stunned by Kelly\u2019s audacity and said that if he had been \u201ca regular guy working at CVS\u201d she would have been furious, but she was entranced by months of communication and flirting. Still, looking back, she said, there were warning signs:\n\n\u201cI was attracted to him and was just like, \u2018Well, OK. Fine,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cMaybe he just has weird ways of getting off.\u201d The two had oral sex that weekend, with Kelly, according to Jones, saying things like, \u201cI gotta teach you how to be with me\u201d and \u201cI gotta train you.\u201d \u201cHe was like a drill sergeant even when he was pleasuring me,\u201d Jones says. \u201cHe was telling me how to bend my back or move my leg here. I\u2019m like, \u2018Why is he directing it like this?\u2019 It was very uncomfortable.\u201d\n\nOn how R. Kelly\u2019s behavior changed once she moved out to Chicago to be with him:\n\nAlmost instantly upon moving to Chicago, Jones says, Kelly began governing nearly every detail of her life, starting with the requirement that she wear baggy sweatpants whenever she went out and text near-constant updates on her whereabouts. (A source who knew Kelly confirmed the singer\u2019s demands on Jones to Rolling Stone.) Jones says she was forced to text either the singer or one of his employees for even the slightest request. (Sample text message: \u201cDaddy, I need to go to the restroom.\u201d)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the day Jones confronted him about the infamous tape that shows the singer allegedly urinating on a teenage girl:\n\nJones had been living with Kelly for less than a month when she claims the first instance of physical abuse occurred, in November 2011. Jones says that on a return trip to Dallas around Thanksgiving, she saw for the first time the video at the heart of his child-pornography trial and challenged Kelly on the phone about it. \u201cHe said, \u2018Bitch, don\u2019t you ever fucking accuse me of something like that,\u2019\u201d Jones says. \u201cHe never had spoken to me like that before.\u201d\n\n\n\nJones claims Kelly remained enraged when she flew back and met him at the airport. \u201cMy heart was just beating through my chest,\u201d she says. \u201cHe just turned into a monster. I blamed myself \u2018cause I was like, \u2018Maybe I shouldn\u2019t\u2019ve said anything.\u2019\u201d As they drove home, Jones says she repeatedly apologized while Kelly kicked her multiple times and delivered a series of open-handed slaps to her face. \u201cI was putting my hand over my face and telling him I was sorry,\u201d Jones says. \u201cHe would start kicking me, telling me I was a stupid bitch [and] don\u2019t ever get in his business.\u201d The next day, Jones says, the couple went shopping and neither spoke about the incident.\n\nOn how Kelly\u2019s manipulation escalated when Jones was moved into a home with two of Kelly\u2019s other girlfriends:\n\nThere were no locks on the doors, but cameras monitored every move and Kelly would punish the women for attempting to leave for any reason without permission. (The source who knew Kelly independently confirmed Kelly\u2019s rules with his girlfriends to Rolling Stone.) Kelly would frequently take away Jones\u2019 phone as punishment\u2014sometimes as long as two months\u2014cutting off her ability to request food or perform basic functions, according to Jones and the other source who knew him.\n\nTwo months into living at the studio, Jones says, Kelly began using starvation on her as punishment for not following his orders. Jones says the longest she went without food was two and a half days, though single days without a meal were not uncommon.\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn how the singer forced Jones to have sex with other female partners:\n\nKelly would frequently fly girls in for sex, says Jones, and order her and his other girlfriends to hook up with them. \u201cYou can\u2019t say no because you\u2019re going to get punished,\u201d she says. \u201cYou just become numb to what\u2019s happening. It\u2019s so traumatic the things that he makes you do to other people and to him.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe videotapes everything that he does, and sometimes he\u2019ll just make you watch what he\u2019s done to other girls or girls that he had be together,\u201d she adds. \u201cHe would masturbate to that and then have you give him oral sex while he\u2019s watching what he did with somebody else on his iPad.\u201d\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is arguably most disturbing about Jones\u2019 described relationship with Kelly is her self-admitted protectiveness of the singer, even after she said he routinely isolated her, demeaned her, starved her and forced her into nonconsensual sex acts. After Jones severed her romantic relationship with Kelly in 2013, she told Rolling Stone that she reached out to the singer after a tense video interview with the Huffington Post.\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018Oh, my God, poor thing,\u2019\u201d Jones told the magazine.\n\nNow, Jones says, she is coming forward with her story because she wants other women to speak up about abuse they\u2019ve suffered at Kelly\u2019s hands, and to encourage the public to take the decades of allegations seriously.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI want them to not be so dismissive towards the women that are speaking out,\u201d says Jones, who, Rolling Stone reports, is currently exploring her legal options against the singer.\n\nDespite the swirl of allegations that have followed Kelly throughout the career, there is currently no open criminal investigation against him.\n\n\n\nRead more at Rolling Stone.", "keywords": ["kelly", "stone", "recentand", "disturbingabuse", "women", "allegations", "jones", "report", "rolling", "sex", "abuse", "singer", "r", "launched", "kellys"], "polarity": -0.020709918736234536, "subjectivity": 0.42943452746084326},

The details that have emerged\u2014Meek\u2019s arrest when he was 19 for a bogus crack charge by a crooked cop, the ensuing years of probation under the eyes of a petty and overbearing judge, the returns to prison under the slightest infractions\u2014might beggar belief: How could such bad lack befall one man?\n\nBut it\u2019s not bad luck. It\u2019s simultaneously intentional and random, the damage of one unlawful, violent arrest compounded over a decade. As Rolling Stone lays out in an exclusive interview with the incarcerated rapper, Meek is fighting a daily struggle to keep his mind and spirit free as his lawyers fight for his release on the outside. Writer Paul Solotaroff also burnishes receipts, capturing in excruciating detail 15 years of aggressions committed against Robert Rihmeek Williams by the Philadelphia legal system.\n\nBelow are some of the highlights.\n\nMeek on letting his family visit him in jail:\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t let them come,\u201d he says of his family, a huge and intensely close tribe in Philadelphia, about 15 miles east of these walls. \u201cIf they see me like this \u2013 fucked-up beard, hair all ganked \u2013 then it\u2019s like I\u2019m really in here. Which I\u2019m not.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbout Meek\u2019s initial arrest:\n\nThere\u2019s no forensic proof that Meek was in court that day, but at least he has witnesses. That\u2019s more than can be said for [officer] Reggie Graham, who either didn\u2019t lab-test the crack \u201cseized,\u201d or the lab test never made its way to court. All he had was his word that the alleged substance was coke; Graham claimed he\u2019d done a \u201cfield test\u201d at the scene. According to multiple legal experts, that missing evidence should have been grounds for an instant mistrial; it was the basis for the warrant and Meek\u2019s arrest. \ufeff\n\n\n\nOfficer Reggie Graham, of course, would later be revealed as having his name on a blacklist, compiled by the Philadelphia district attorney, of cops considered too dishonest or corrupt to take the stand at criminal trials.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn that first conviction:\n\nMeek waived a jury trial \u2013 it costs thousands more in legal fees \u2013 so [Judge Genece] Brinkley decided the case. She acquitted Meek\u2019s co-defendants, then found Meek guilty of seven charges \u2013 four involving the gun. There\u2019s no arguing that Meek had a gun on him; he took the stand and admitted so himself. But in Philly, illegal carry is a misdemeanor, typically punished with a fine and house arrest. Instead, he got two years in a county prison and eight years of strict probation \u2013 all because Graham swore he\u2019d seen him sell drugs and aim a weapon at cops.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn how Judge Genece Brinkley responded to Meek\u2019s success:\n\nIncensed about the change in Meek\u2019s travel plans, Brinkley hauled him in for a drug test. At a violation-of-parole hearing three weeks later, she ordered a second drug test. (Both screens came up clean.) Nevertheless, she barred Meek from touring, which cost him \u201c$7 or $8 million,\u201d says Clint Saunders, Meek\u2019s booking agent. Next, she replaced his probation officer.

In this case, they're looking to be the latter which is a shame because something clearly happened to Jackie.\n\nThe story itself is a \"good\" one. Well, as good as a story can be that outlines a sexual assault and a schools seeming lack of concern and intent to address an issue. I've only been to UVA once in my life to attend the graduation of a friend from law school. I didn't even know the school was founded by Thomas Jefferson. Point is, I knew very little about UVA before reading this article and now I know names of administrators. I've also learned some disturbing lyrics to a song sung - seemingly proudly - by students and alumni called \"Rugby Road\" titled after the name of the road where the fraternities are housed on UVA's campus. Jackie's story, if true - and that's where the problems come in - speaks to a culture at UVA that is more concerned with tradition, history, and public image (aka the struggle of most \"prestigious\" schools when it comes to negative attention) than the safety of its students, namely young women being assaulted almost casually.\n\nThat story is going to become lighter fluid on a fire because it names a school, a fraternity, and talks about a culture of rape at said fraternity. No way that the parties involved weren't going to start fact checking. And sure as shooting, they did. The details of Jackie's story began to fall apart regarding her accuser, the fraternity itself, and the aftermath of her assault. I'm aware that many people who experience trauma block out certain memories and it is entirely possible for facts to get jumbled. This is not Jackie's problem, that is Erdely's problem. Jackie mentioned friends who were involved in the immediate aftermath who are now disputing her recollection of events and weren't even spoken to by Erdely. Rolling Stone probably should have deaded the story. Which is a shame because the story of Jackie's thats corroborated by her friends is STILL a compelling story and one that could still stand as an important touching off point. To be clear, I believe something happened to that poor girl. I don't doubt that at all. It's more the reporting that has caused the issue.\n\nAlso, none of the people who were accused in the story were contacted or got to have their say. I'm no journo. I'm just a blogger, evidenced by my many typos and opinion-based writing career. But I can't imagine that its okay to write a story accusing people and not even reaching out to those being accused. Sure they'll probably turn you down, but you have to at least try, right? And in this case, it presents and odd dichotomy. The story was too excited to tell itself, so to speak, but the larger issues addressed are still important. The fraternity under fire in the article might be falsely accused in this case, but the larger issue of sexual assault in fraternities on these campuses is still important. Hell, this particular may STILL have the problem outlined in the story, but because of the details that were wrong, they get to play the unfair victim role and many might ignore that fact. While every facet of the story is worthy of note as a way of discussing a larger problem. the bigger story becomes the reporting itself and the publications willingness to publish it.\n\nVery few publications are above reproach. They've ALL made mistakes. In an industry built upon breaking stories and finding the important angle to make a story stick, many reporters have taken leeway. It's fictitious, but on The Wire's 5th season, they outline how a low-level reporter goes from nobody to somebody via the creation of a story that doesn't exist THEN gets outed by whose been living the lie he's reporting\u2026falsely. And we all remember the story of Stephen Glass (seemingly the inspiration for Wire's last season), the former journo who fabricated countless stories and sources on his rise to stardom at The New Republic (a site going thru its own issues right now as well).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere's a certain trust we place into the hands of journalists. We assume they've done their due dilligence to get a story together. We also assume the editors vet and go over with a fine tooth comb the details. We assume that what's presented is true. And I'd wager that most times it is. Sources are cited, quotes are corroborated, facts are checked. But sometimes a story is too good to worry about in its entirety. And many of us who write have fallen victim to that trap. Bloggers fuck up all the time. The race to first is a lot faster than the race to right. This particular story took a long time to come together, and it STILL fell through the cracks. No publisher wants to have to issue an apology to its readers or acknowledge they didn't do enough to establish the veracity of a story.\n\nIt's hard out here in the journo world.\n\nThis is also how I know I'm not meant to fact check. I read the story. It didn't even dawn on me how many angles weren't covered or that she didn't talk to all the folks involved in the story. I'd have just read it and been like\u2026dammit UVA, you all suck. And they probably still do, but not for the exact reasons supported by the story. I hope this Rolling Stone issue doesn't obscure the larger issues. It's important to talk about sexual assault on college campuses because its happening. Innocent people's lives are being altered in an instant, and its important to address that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust a damn shame that Rolling Stone got in its own way of pushing forward the conversation on a topic worthy of discussion.", "keywords": ["stone", "picture", "problem", "important", "issues", "bigger", "rolling", "uva", "sexual", "assault", "larger", "facts", "jackies"], "polarity": 0.18225110104016354, "subjectivity": 0.5644223484848484},

After sitting the kids on her lap, chatting and posing for pictures with them, Shuler had elves escort the children to a \u201cfront room of a rowhouse packed with toys.\u201d\n\nThe North Philly kids received luxe gifts like miniature white Bentleys and Batmobiles, as well as guitars, bicycles, scooters and hair bundles.\n\nAll told, Shuler had arranged for at least 800 presents to be given out to the neighborhood kids.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Shuler, who owns and runs the soul food restaurant Country Cooking, has given back to the community. The Philadelphia Daily News reports that she gave away hundreds of book bags as back-to-school gifts. And when Meek Mill was locked up, Shuler shut down Country Cooking and gave away \u201cFree Meek Mill Meals,\u201d platters of fried fish and grits, to raise awareness about the rapper\u2019s harsh punishment.\n\nRead more at the Philadelphia Daily News.", "keywords": ["christmas", "owner", "philly", "epic", "queen", "white", "party", "stunt", "kids", "restaurant", "shuler", "philadelphia", "daily", "pole", "sitting", "neighborhood", "north"], "polarity": 0.07618492618492617, "subjectivity": 0.4123931623931624},

The details that have emerged\u2014Meek\u2019s arrest when he was 19 for a bogus crack charge by a crooked cop, the ensuing years of probation under the eyes of a petty and overbearing judge, the returns to prison under the slightest infractions\u2014might beggar belief: How could such bad lack befall one man?\n\nBut it\u2019s not bad luck. It\u2019s simultaneously intentional and random, the damage of one unlawful, violent arrest compounded over a decade. As Rolling Stone lays out in an exclusive interview with the incarcerated rapper, Meek is fighting a daily struggle to keep his mind and spirit free as his lawyers fight for his release on the outside. Writer Paul Solotaroff also burnishes receipts, capturing in excruciating detail 15 years of aggressions committed against Robert Rihmeek Williams by the Philadelphia legal system.\n\nBelow are some of the highlights.\n\nMeek on letting his family visit him in jail:\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t let them come,\u201d he says of his family, a huge and intensely close tribe in Philadelphia, about 15 miles east of these walls. \u201cIf they see me like this \u2013 fucked-up beard, hair all ganked \u2013 then it\u2019s like I\u2019m really in here. Which I\u2019m not.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbout Meek\u2019s initial arrest:\n\nThere\u2019s no forensic proof that Meek was in court that day, but at least he has witnesses. That\u2019s more than can be said for [officer] Reggie Graham, who either didn\u2019t lab-test the crack \u201cseized,\u201d or the lab test never made its way to court. All he had was his word that the alleged substance was coke; Graham claimed he\u2019d done a \u201cfield test\u201d at the scene. According to multiple legal experts, that missing evidence should have been grounds for an instant mistrial; it was the basis for the warrant and Meek\u2019s arrest. \ufeff\n\n\n\nOfficer Reggie Graham, of course, would later be revealed as having his name on a blacklist, compiled by the Philadelphia district attorney, of cops considered too dishonest or corrupt to take the stand at criminal trials.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn that first conviction:\n\nMeek waived a jury trial \u2013 it costs thousands more in legal fees \u2013 so [Judge Genece] Brinkley decided the case. She acquitted Meek\u2019s co-defendants, then found Meek guilty of seven charges \u2013 four involving the gun. There\u2019s no arguing that Meek had a gun on him; he took the stand and admitted so himself. But in Philly, illegal carry is a misdemeanor, typically punished with a fine and house arrest. Instead, he got two years in a county prison and eight years of strict probation \u2013 all because Graham swore he\u2019d seen him sell drugs and aim a weapon at cops.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn how Judge Genece Brinkley responded to Meek\u2019s success:\n\nIncensed about the change in Meek\u2019s travel plans, Brinkley hauled him in for a drug test. At a violation-of-parole hearing three weeks later, she ordered a second drug test. (Both screens came up clean.) Nevertheless, she barred Meek from touring, which cost him \u201c$7 or $8 million,\u201d says Clint Saunders, Meek\u2019s booking agent. Next, she replaced his probation officer. Meek\u2019s dealings with his PO\u2019s had always been cordial, but his new one, Treas Underwood, was a \u201cdragon.\u201d \u201cStraight out the gate, she hated me, talking to me like I\u2019m some kind of rapist,\u201d says Meek. \u201cShe would follow me around and pop up at my house, looking for some way to do me dirty.\u201d \u201cBefore her, we would fax Meek\u2019s schedule once a week,\u201d says Smith. \u201cNow, we had to tell her every hour of our day: \u2018Meek\u2019s check-in is at so-and-so; we leave Miami at midnight.\u2019 Man, that ain\u2019t the way the rap game works. Half the time, you don\u2019t know when you\u2019ll go onstage.\u201d\ufeff\n\nOn the strange relationship between Brinkley, Meek\u2019s parole officer and his former manager:\n\nAn odd theme emerged in the hearings that followed: Brinkley bashed Roc-Nation, Meek\u2019s management firm, and raved about Charlie Mack. \u201cI don\u2019t know how or when you all got involved,\u201d said Brinkley, but \u201che didn\u2019t have no problems with the other manager.\u201d Underwood, the probation officer, joined the chorus: \u201cWorking with Charlie Mack, hands down, he is phenomenal. [Your management people] are a problem for you.\u201d Meek was perplexed. He\u2019d made pennies with Mack, and more money than he could spend under Roc.\ufeff\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecords would later show that his former manager Charlie Mack and probation officer Treas Underwood had \u201cdozens of long phone calls\u201d with each other during that time, and Underwood had spoken candidly about Meek\u2019s case to her boyfriend. On those grounds, Meek\u2019s lawyers were successful in moving her off his case.\n\nOn Brinkley\u2019s history of aggressive legal action:\n\n[Detectives] searched state databases for Brinkley\u2019s name on cases overturned by higher courts. Instead, the shocker find was dozens of civil lawsuits, the great bulk of them brought by Brinkley. A 61-year-old Tennesseean who\u2019d won her Philly court seat in 1993, Brinkley has owned and rented a number of properties in North Philly, and has sued, or been sued by, many tenants. Brindle-Khym and his staffers spoke to some of those tenants; they heard horror stories about Brinkley, the landlord.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmong the complaints: that Brinkley raised rents midlease, that she aggressively pushed out a family who had just lost their infant son, and that she encouraged a contractor to lie under oath against another contractor she had requested do work on her home.\n\nOn that bizarre 2016 request Brinkley made of Meek and his then-girlfriend, Nicki Minaj:\n\n\u201cThe judge said, \u2018I\u2019m not really the monster you think I am. In fact, a lot of people look up to me.\u2019 \u201c Then she asked them to do a song for her, a remix of the Boys II Men hit \u201cOn Bended Knee.\u201d \u201cFucking Nicki busts out laughing, but I grabbed her leg, going, \u2018Yo, this is my life here,\u2019 \u201c Meek recalls. \u201cI tried to tell the judge, \u2018All respect, but that ain\u2019t me. I\u2019m a Philly street rapper, not a bubblegum dude.\u2019 She says, \u2018Fine, then,\u2019 in a real sarcastic way. \u2018Suit yourself.\u2019\u201d\ufeff\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn how Meek makes sense of it all:\n\n", "keywords": ["underwood", "stone", "judge", "meeks", "probation", "jail", "brinkley", "shares", "rolling", "talks", "milland", "meek", "officer", "im", "way", "receipts", "test"], "polarity": 0.026374130919585462, "subjectivity": 0.38627836809654986},

Robert Rihmeek Williams is a Philadelphia man who many believe has been wrongly incarcerated by an overzealous judge who is using her influence and judicial power to keep the man down.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose who believe that Williams is being wrongly incarcerated will be the first to tell you that he isn\u2019t a saint, but he\u2019s no Meek Mill. Meek Mill murders on wax. Robert Rihmeek Williams has not murdered anyone. He\u2019s not a danger to society. He\u2019s not a criminal.\n\nOn records, Meek Mill has bodies and bricks. In real life, Robert Rihmeek Williams pops wheelies and, at one time, Percocets.\n\nEither way, they are both Pennsylvania Inmate ND8400.\n\nMany believe that Robert Rihmeek Williams is paying for Meek Mill\u2019s mistakes. I\u2019m one of them. Maybe it\u2019s the lyrics of some of Mill\u2019s greatest work that have a Philadelphia judge, Genece E. Brinkley, recently deeming Williams \u201ca danger to the community.\u201d Either way, Williams is in the bing, and if his lawyers can\u2019t get this judge thrown off the case, he won\u2019t be coming out anytime soon.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo let\u2019s take a look at the case and show how bizarre this whole thing has gotten.\n\nThe whole case started back in 2007 when Williams was just 18. The rapper still had braids, and anyone who\u2019s followed his career knows just how long ago this was.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an interview with Billboard in 2015, Williams said he was on his way to a corner store when cops stopped him and \u201cbeat the shit out of me.\u201d He still had the mug shot photo from the incident on his cellphone, which showed his face badly beaten.\n\n\u201c[I had] a concussion, stitches, braids ripped out. My blood was on the ceiling, on the floor,\u201d he said.\n\nPhiladelphia cops said he tried to shoot them. Williams said that didn\u2019t happen.\n\nDidn\u2019t matter. Williams was charged with assault, drug and gun possession. He was tried in 2008, and in January 2009, he was sentenced to 11-23 months in jail by Commons Pleas Judge Brinkley, who commented that she wanted the rapper to \u201cturn his life around from selling drugs and instead focus on his musical talent.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliams served just five months of his initial sentence and was released in 2009 and given house arrest, which ended later that year. He was also given five years\u2019 probation.\n\nEverything that has happened since\u2014all the news about his incarceration and run-ins with the judge\u2014stems from this incident from when he was just 18 years old. And here\u2019s the thing: Every time Williams commits another infraction, any infraction, the judge adds more probation time to his sentence, meaning that although Williams is a free man, he\u2019s still living in a prison state.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom 2010 to 2012, Williams would test positive for weed and opioids, which wasn\u2019t bad enough to warrant probation violations, but the incidents began to be straws that broke the judge\u2019s back. In 2012, after Williams missed a couple of court dates, the judge ruled that because Williams couldn\u2019t make it to court, maybe he shouldn\u2019t be trusted with travel.\n\nThis appears to be the point when the relationship between Brinkley and Williams soured.\n\nAfter stating that there was nothing more important than appearing in her courtroom, the judge determined that Williams shouldn\u2019t be traveling if he couldn\u2019t make his court appearances. Williams\u2019 lawyer Joe Tacopina argued that as the rapper\u2019s success continued to rise, his schedule became more demanding. But Brinkley wasn\u2019t having it; she banned the star from going on the road.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s how Billboard describes Williams\u2019 ascent and perpetual downfall in 2014:\n\n\n\nAfter his prison release, Meek Mill made it his duty to take his music seriously, which worked out in his favor as the rapper signed with Rick Ross\u2019 Maybach Music Group label in 2011. Meek showed promise with the release of his breakout track \u201cI\u2019m a Boss\u201d and his star continued to rise since as his debut album, Dreams and Nightmares, peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 chart. Despite all his success, the Philly native landed right back in courts in 2014 for violating his probation by booking performances outside of Philly without Judge Brinkley\u2019s approval. The rapper was sentenced to three to six months in jail. Meek began his stint in July and was released from prison in December 2014. He was put on parole and ordered to complete etiquette classes.\n\nEtiquette classes? Why?\n\nIt was \u201c(i)n order to address his inappropriate social media use and crude language in the courtroom,\u201d Brinkley wrote in court papers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApparently the judge wasn\u2019t keen on the rapper using foul language on social media, so she decided she was going to do something about it, and that something was etiquette classes.\n\n\u201cMultiple Philadelphia lawyers told [music website] Pitchfork they had never heard of a judge ordering a defendant to take etiquette classes, though they noted that for better or worse, judges\u2019 sentences are sometimes creative. For the next year, Meek attended court hearings every three months,\u201d Pitchfork reports.\n\nMost important, though, he was given an additional five years of probation.\n\nIn 2016, Williams would have several small infractions, including failing to meet with his probation officer and submitting cold water instead of urine during a drug test. The biggest infraction, and the one that really seemed to bother the judge, was that Williams again had traveled without her consent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe only problem with this is that if Williams, as a rapper, can\u2019t travel and perform songs while they\u2019re hot, how can he make money? Saying that a rapper can work but he can\u2019t leave his home state is like saying that I can write whatever I want, but I can\u2019t use a computer, pen, paper or phone.\n\n\n\nFor this infraction, he was given six to 12 months of house arrest, but the real injustice here is that he was given another six years of probation. Which means that Williams would have to appear before this judge for an additional six years, hoping that he wasn\u2019t thrown back in prison for the most minor misstep.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinally, in 2017, Williams had two small infractions, and these are the crux of Brinkley\u2019s reasoning for sending Williams back to jail.\n\nAt an airport in St. Louis, an employee wanted to take a photo with Williams, who refused, resulting in one of Williams\u2019 entourage and the airport employee getting into a scuffle. Williams said that he was trying to break up the fight, but he was charged with misdemeanor assault. The assault charge was eventually dropped, but it was still cited in the judge\u2019s reasoning for why he should go back to jail.\n\n\n\nAfter the airport fight, Williams was in New York City to perform his aptly tilted song \u201cYBA (Young Black America)\u201d from his album Wins & Losses on The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon. The night before the performance, Williams and friends drove dirt bikes around Manhattan, during which, police witnessed Williams popping a wheelie. Williams was not arrested. In fact, he didn\u2019t get arrested until video of the infamous wheelie went viral on social media. Police then charged him with reckless endangerment and reckless driving.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cA guy literally popped a wheelie for 10 seconds on the street with no one else around,\u201d Tacopina said in a video posted by TMZ. \u201cAnd the police were there. That\u2019s very important. The police were there, and they saw it, and they didn\u2019t arrest him. They didn\u2019t even give him a traffic ticket, but somehow the video made it to social media.\u201d\n\nAccording to TMZ, Meek accepted a plea deal that removes the charge from his record under the condition that he stay out of trouble for six months and complete community service.\n\nWhile all of these are probation violations, they are also the smallest of infractions that continue to have Williams in a perpetual prisoner state. Keep in mind that Williams is almost 30 years old, and because of his violations, he is still on probation from a case stemming from 2007!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd if all of this isn\u2019t bizarre enough, let\u2019s also add that the judge in his case allegedly asked the rapper to remake the Boyz II Men love ballad \u201cOn Bended Knee\u201d and to name-drop the judge!\n\nWilliams\u2019 lawyers also say that she asked the rapper to leave Roc Nation management and sign with a friend of hers who they say has a checkered past. And the judge allegedly appeared at one of Williams\u2019 community service assignments to see if he was really there. The judge is now reportedly being investigated by the FBI for the way in which she\u2019s handled Williams\u2019 case.\n\nThe whole thing has been absurd.\n\nIn truth, the only person who seems to want to ensure that Williams stays in prison is the judge. In fact, during his last hearing before her court, not one person\u2014not the prosecutors, not the police, no one\u2014wanted him imprisoned for violations that didn\u2019t even amount to actual charges.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat we see in the Meek Mill case is someone who can go to jail for a lengthy term for not committing a new crime, but doing things that most would deem mistakes,\u201d Philadelphia\u2019s top public defender, Keir Bradford-Grey, ttold WHYY. \u201cIf we want mass incarceration to end, we have to understand what it looks like, and his case does exemplify that.\u201d\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s to hoping that Williams is freed for the crimes committed by Mill and that someday we can stop holding people in prison forever even after they\u2019ve served their time.", "keywords": ["judge", "rapper", "months", "williams", "probation", "bizarre", "meek", "mills", "explained", "given", "incarceration", "court", "case", "prison"], "polarity": 0.06775734716328777, "subjectivity": 0.39078364979355096},

His attorneys filed a motion for bail on Nov. 16, but Judge Genece Brinkley has yet to issue a ruling on that motion.\n\nOn Monday, Meek\u2019s attorneys filed a habeas corpus petition, claiming that Brinkley was ignoring Meek\u2019s post-sentencing motions and making it impossible for him to file an appeal, according to the New York Daily News.\n\nWhile the Pennsylvania Superior Court denied the rapper\u2019s request to be freed from prison and allowed to post bail, it ruled that Brinkley should immediately rule on Meek\u2019s previous request, saying, \u201cThe Court of Common Pleas is directed to enter a disposition of petitioner\u2019s Nov. 16, 2017, motion for bail without further delay.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrinkley sentenced Meek Mill to prison earlier this month after a drug test came back positive for the prescription drug Percocet and the rapper was arrested twice this year\u2014once for an altercation in a St. Louis airport and again for popping wheelies on a motorcycle in New York.\n\nThe criminal charges in both of those arrests were later dropped, but the judge determined that the mere fact he was arrested violated the terms of his probation. She sentenced him to prison even though both a prosecutor and Meek\u2019s probation officer recommended that he not be jailed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a statement to NBC News, Meek\u2019s attorney Joe Tacopina said: \u201cWe are pleased that the Superior Court took immediate action to direct the Court of Common Pleas to decide on the application for bail \u2018without further delay.\u2019 We remain hopeful that Mr. Williams will be promptly released on bail.\u201d\n\nOn Monday the Rev.

First, dip the brush into the liquid adhesive and apply it to your eyelid, allowing about 30-60 seconds to dry. While it\u2019s still wet, dip the same brush into the pot of glitter\u2014which is ground so fine it looks like a powder\u2014and brush the glitter onto your lids.\n\nVoil\u00e0!

A few tricks: Avoid the crease of your eye\u2014unless you have ample time to sit with your eyes closed, it\u2019s very difficult for the adhesive to dry in the fold in the lid, and it will feel sticky for long time. If it happens, just moisten a cotton swab with water and wipe it away. Also, make sure to comb your lashes out immediately afterward in case a stray sparkle goes rogue and lands in the base of your lashes.\n\nFor a more dimensional look, you can layer the adhesive and Lit Kit glitter over regular eye shadow. Another easy and quick day-to-night makeup transformation is to use the glitter as a liquid eyeliner\u2014it takes five minutes. For golden lids, Addicted is now my go-to color, and I used Smolder for a sleek and shimmering eyeliner. Lit Kits give you glittery glamour for $28.

The Philadelphia Inquirer was the first to report on the existence of the list, which was compiled under former DA Seth Williams. He is currently in jail, serving a corruption sentence.\n\nMeek\u2019s lawyers believe that this is enough grounds to overturn the rapper\u2019s initial conviction on gun and drug charges, which was largely based on the account of Officer Reginald V.

How dare he go to a playground with a toy? How dare Tamir\u2014in a country that clings to its weapons, in a country where white women can point BB guns at police and live, where white extremists can openly menace black neighborhoods with assault rifles\u2014walk around in his black skin and be a child?\n\nI\u2019ve written previously that our children are positioned on a seesaw of white hypocrisy and black respectability on the derelict playground of American racism. That is the playground that Tamir Rice stepped foot on that day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cShots fired, male down, um, black male, maybe 20,\u201d either Loehmann or his partner, Frank Garmback, radioed in. \u201cBlack handgun.\u201d\n\nIn a country that overwhelmingly distorts black childhood to fit its vile and violent racial prejudice, Tamir never stood a chance.\n\n\u201cChildren in most societies are considered to be in a distinct group with characteristics such as innocence and the need for protection,\u201d said Phillip Atiba Goff, Ph.D., of UCLA, in his study \u201cThe Essence of Innocence: Consequences of Dehumanizing Black Children\u201d (pdf). \u201cOur research found that black boys can be seen as responsible for their actions at an age when white boys still benefit from the assumption that children are essentially innocent.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut we don\u2019t need a study.

Singing. Dreaming. Being. Dead.\n\nI wonder what he was feeling, lying outside in the cold, bleeding out on that playground. I wonder if he heard his 14-year-old sister\u2019s screams as she ran to his side before they tackled her to the ground, handcuffed her and shoved her into the patrol car. I wonder if he saw Loehmann\u2019s hatred for him as he possibly parted his lips to tell him that the gun wasn\u2019t real.\n\nI wonder if Loehmann\u2014who has a documented history of being \u201cweepy,\u201d \u201clacking maturity,\u201d an inability \u201cto perform basic functions as instructed\u201d and exhibiting a \u201cdangerous loss of composure during live range training\u201d\u2014looked into Tamir\u2019s eyes before executing him in 0.792 seconds. Or was his blackness all that he needed to see before he pulled the trigger?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I see photos of Tamir, husky and bright-eyed, smiling that mischievous grin, I am reminded of my three sons, especially our eldest, his innocence and awkwardness encased in a large 10-year-old frame that causes passersby to remark on his size. I am reminded that to his father and me, he is our baby, but to cops like Loehmann and Garmback, he is guilty of existing until proved otherwise.\n\nI am reminded, again, that justice in this country looks like dead black children and the free white cops who kill them. It always has.\n\nTamir will never again be able to tell his mother about his experiences, his excited words climbing clumsily on top of each other, one after the other, scrambling to break free.

Robert Rihmeek Williams is a Philadelphia man who many believe has been wrongly incarcerated by an overzealous judge who is using her influence and judicial power to keep the man down.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose who believe that Williams is being wrongly incarcerated will be the first to tell you that he isn\u2019t a saint, but he\u2019s no Meek Mill. Meek Mill murders on wax. Robert Rihmeek Williams has not murdered anyone. He\u2019s not a danger to society. He\u2019s not a criminal.\n\nOn records, Meek Mill has bodies and bricks. In real life, Robert Rihmeek Williams pops wheelies and, at one time, Percocets.\n\nEither way, they are both Pennsylvania Inmate ND8400.\n\nMany believe that Robert Rihmeek Williams is paying for Meek Mill\u2019s mistakes. I\u2019m one of them. Maybe it\u2019s the lyrics of some of Mill\u2019s greatest work that have a Philadelphia judge, Genece E. Brinkley, recently deeming Williams \u201ca danger to the community.\u201d Either way, Williams is in the bing, and if his lawyers can\u2019t get this judge thrown off the case, he won\u2019t be coming out anytime soon.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo let\u2019s take a look at the case and show how bizarre this whole thing has gotten.\n\nThe whole case started back in 2007 when Williams was just 18. The rapper still had braids, and anyone who\u2019s followed his career knows just how long ago this was.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an interview with Billboard in 2015, Williams said he was on his way to a corner store when cops stopped him and \u201cbeat the shit out of me.\u201d He still had the mug shot photo from the incident on his cellphone, which showed his face badly beaten.\n\n\u201c[I had] a concussion, stitches, braids ripped out. My blood was on the ceiling, on the floor,\u201d he said.\n\nPhiladelphia cops said he tried to shoot them. Williams said that didn\u2019t happen.\n\nDidn\u2019t matter. Williams was charged with assault, drug and gun possession. He was tried in 2008, and in January 2009, he was sentenced to 11-23 months in jail by Commons Pleas Judge Brinkley, who commented that she wanted the rapper to \u201cturn his life around from selling drugs and instead focus on his musical talent.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliams served just five months of his initial sentence and was released in 2009 and given house arrest, which ended later that year. He was also given five years\u2019 probation.\n\nEverything that has happened since\u2014all the news about his incarceration and run-ins with the judge\u2014stems from this incident from when he was just 18 years old. And here\u2019s the thing: Every time Williams commits another infraction, any infraction, the judge adds more probation time to his sentence, meaning that although Williams is a free man, he\u2019s still living in a prison state.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom 2010 to 2012, Williams would test positive for weed and opioids, which wasn\u2019t bad enough to warrant probation violations, but the incidents began to be straws that broke the judge\u2019s back. In 2012, after Williams missed a couple of court dates, the judge ruled that because Williams couldn\u2019t make it to court, maybe he shouldn\u2019t be trusted with travel.\n\nThis appears to be the point when the relationship between Brinkley and Williams soured.\n\nAfter stating that there was nothing more important than appearing in her courtroom, the judge determined that Williams shouldn\u2019t be traveling if he couldn\u2019t make his court appearances. Williams\u2019 lawyer Joe Tacopina argued that as the rapper\u2019s success continued to rise, his schedule became more demanding. But Brinkley wasn\u2019t having it; she banned the star from going on the road.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s how Billboard describes Williams\u2019 ascent and perpetual downfall in 2014:\n\n\n\nAfter his prison release, Meek Mill made it his duty to take his music seriously, which worked out in his favor as the rapper signed with Rick Ross\u2019 Maybach Music Group label in 2011. Meek showed promise with the release of his breakout track \u201cI\u2019m a Boss\u201d and his star continued to rise since as his debut album, Dreams and Nightmares, peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 chart. Despite all his success, the Philly native landed right back in courts in 2014 for violating his probation by booking performances outside of Philly without Judge Brinkley\u2019s approval. The rapper was sentenced to three to six months in jail. Meek began his stint in July and was released from prison in December 2014. He was put on parole and ordered to complete etiquette classes.\n\nEtiquette classes? Why?\n\nIt was \u201c(i)n order to address his inappropriate social media use and crude language in the courtroom,\u201d Brinkley wrote in court papers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApparently the judge wasn\u2019t keen on the rapper using foul language on social media, so she decided she was going to do something about it, and that something was etiquette classes.\n\n\u201cMultiple Philadelphia lawyers told [music website] Pitchfork they had never heard of a judge ordering a defendant to take etiquette classes, though they noted that for better or worse, judges\u2019 sentences are sometimes creative. For the next year, Meek attended court hearings every three months,\u201d Pitchfork reports.\n\nMost important, though, he was given an additional five years of probation.\n\nIn 2016, Williams would have several small infractions, including failing to meet with his probation officer and submitting cold water instead of urine during a drug test. The biggest infraction, and the one that really seemed to bother the judge, was that Williams again had traveled without her consent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe only problem with this is that if Williams, as a rapper, can\u2019t travel and perform songs while they\u2019re hot, how can he make money? Saying that a rapper can work but he can\u2019t leave his home state is like saying that I can write whatever I want, but I can\u2019t use a computer, pen, paper or phone.\n\n\n\nFor this infraction, he was given six to 12 months of house arrest, but the real injustice here is that he was given another six years of probation. Which means that Williams would have to appear before this judge for an additional six years, hoping that he wasn\u2019t thrown back in prison for the most minor misstep.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinally, in 2017, Williams had two small infractions, and these are the crux of Brinkley\u2019s reasoning for sending Williams back to jail.\n\nAt an airport in St. Louis, an employee wanted to take a photo with Williams, who refused, resulting in one of Williams\u2019 entourage and the airport employee getting into a scuffle. Williams said that he was trying to break up the fight, but he was charged with misdemeanor assault. The assault charge was eventually dropped, but it was still cited in the judge\u2019s reasoning for why he should go back to jail.\n\n\n\nAfter the airport fight, Williams was in New York City to perform his aptly tilted song \u201cYBA (Young Black America)\u201d from his album Wins & Losses on The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon. The night before the performance, Williams and friends drove dirt bikes around Manhattan, during which, police witnessed Williams popping a wheelie. Williams was not arrested. In fact, he didn\u2019t get arrested until video of the infamous wheelie went viral on social media. Police then charged him with reckless endangerment and reckless driving.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cA guy literally popped a wheelie for 10 seconds on the street with no one else around,\u201d Tacopina said in a video posted by TMZ. \u201cAnd the police were there. That\u2019s very important. The police were there, and they saw it, and they didn\u2019t arrest him. They didn\u2019t even give him a traffic ticket, but somehow the video made it to social media.\u201d\n\nAccording to TMZ, Meek accepted a plea deal that removes the charge from his record under the condition that he stay out of trouble for six months and complete community service.\n\nWhile all of these are probation violations, they are also the smallest of infractions that continue to have Williams in a perpetual prisoner state. Keep in mind that Williams is almost 30 years old, and because of his violations, he is still on probation from a case stemming from 2007!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd if all of this isn\u2019t bizarre enough, let\u2019s also add that the judge in his case allegedly asked the rapper to remake the Boyz II Men love ballad \u201cOn Bended Knee\u201d and to name-drop the judge!\n\nWilliams\u2019 lawyers also say that she asked the rapper to leave Roc Nation management and sign with a friend of hers who they say has a checkered past. And the judge allegedly appeared at one of Williams\u2019 community service assignments to see if he was really there. The judge is now reportedly being investigated by the FBI for the way in which she\u2019s handled Williams\u2019 case.\n\nThe whole thing has been absurd.\n\nIn truth, the only person who seems to want to ensure that Williams stays in prison is the judge. In fact, during his last hearing before her court, not one person\u2014not the prosecutors, not the police, no one\u2014wanted him imprisoned for violations that didn\u2019t even amount to actual charges.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat we see in the Meek Mill case is someone who can go to jail for a lengthy term for not committing a new crime, but doing things that most would deem mistakes,\u201d Philadelphia\u2019s top public defender, Keir Bradford-Grey, ttold WHYY. \u201cIf we want mass incarceration to end, we have to understand what it looks like, and his case does exemplify that.\u201d\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s to hoping that Williams is freed for the crimes committed by Mill and that someday we can stop holding people in prison forever even after they\u2019ve served their time.", "keywords": ["judge", "rapper", "months", "williams", "probation", "bizarre", "meek", "mills", "explained", "given", "incarceration", "court", "case", "prison"], "polarity": 0.06775734716328777, "subjectivity": 0.39078364979355096},

Not many will wrestle with the fact that Fields is not unique and that this is not evidence of a broken system, but of a racist system, functioning exactly as intended.\n\nWhat they won\u2019t do is admit that, as Very Smart Brothas\u2019 Damon Young so succinctly noted, had this been a white girl, Fields would never have laid a hand on her.\n\nThis past June, when Casebolt assaulted and violently restrained Dajerria Becton, I wrote this:\n\n\u201cChildren in most societies are considered to be in a distinct group with characteristics such as innocence and the need for protection,\u201d said Phillip Atiba Goff, Ph.D., of the University of California, Los Angeles, in his study \u201cThe Essence of Innocence: Consequences of Dehumanizing Black Children\u201d (pdf). The study gauged white police officers\u2019 prejudice and unconscious dehumanization of black people by comparing them to apes. According to Goff, \u201cOur research found that black boys can be seen as responsible for their actions at an age when white boys still benefit from the assumption that children are essentially innocent.\u201d The same is true for black girls, quiet as it\u2019s kept.\n\nThis is why over 1,000 of us, as well as over 250 concerned black men, signed a letter to the Obama administration explaining #WhyWeCantWait. Black women and girls are primary targets of state-sanctioned violence, not just adjacent mourners of and fighters for black men. And it bears repeating that just as was the case in McKinney, Texas, in Columbia, S.C., an adult black man stood by while a young black girl was being assaulted by a white police officer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClearly, the black man in the video\u2014whether it be an administrator or some random person standing at the front of the classroom armed with a walkie talkie\u2014believes, as (white) teacher Robert Long allegedly does, that \u201cshe should have cooperated\u201d or else he would not have been complicit in the violence that showed every black girl in that math class how valuable they are in his equation.\n\n\n\nHow\u2019s that for black power and solidarity? Can you imagine Long\u2019s justification being effectively co-signed by a black man when Eric Garner was killed or Michael Brown was executed on Canfield Drive? What about when Ramarley Graham was gunned down in his home, or Oscar Grant was shot in the back at Fruitvale Station, or Martese Johnson was violently assaulted for partying while black?\n\n\n\nNo, but we witnessed it with Dajerria. We witnessed it with Sandra Bland. We witnessed it with Ersula Ore. And we\u2019re witnessing it now. Even when there is no evidence that this girl was in any way disrupting class, the very suggestion that she could have been a \u201cmouthy\u201d black girl has been enough for some people to ignore their responsibility to her, and others to ask, \u201cWell, did she deserve it?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe answer: Hell no.\n\n\n\nIn her interview with WLTX, Niya Kenny, the girl\u2019s classmate and the second girl Fields arrested, on a charge of \u201cdisturbing schools\u201d for coming to her classmate\u2019s defense, explained why she was so enraged by what she saw: \u201cI know this girl don\u2019t got nobody.\u201d\n\nPrecedent teaches us that if this incident had happened anywhere outside the four walls of that classroom, that young girl would probably be dead. Dead because she \u201cdidn\u2019t comply.\u201d Dead because she \u201clooked threatening.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDead because she is black.\n\nAnd it is up to us who believe that black girls matter to demand justice for our girls because it is painfully clear that no one else will.\n\nIt is up to us to make sure that they know\u2014every second of every minute of every day\u2014that they do have somebody.\n\n", "keywords": ["girl", "matter", "talk", "white", "man", "fields", "girls", "state", "wont", "students", "assaulted", "black", "cop"], "polarity": -0.005472279821019312, "subjectivity": 0.46504504832235855},

Residents of Philadelphia will take to the streets Monday afternoon to protest the imprisonment of the rapper and notorious collector of L\u2019s after the hip-hop star was imprisoned on parole violations.\n\nBorn Robert Williams, the emcee was sentenced to two to four years for violating the conditions of his parole in a 2008 weapons case. Mill was arrested in March for an altercation at a St. Louis airport, but charges were later dropped. In August of this year, Meek was charged with reckless endangerment after a traffic violation on a motorcycle.\n\nSupporters argue that Mill\u2019s sentence is too harsh, while lawyers for the star say that the judge has an unusual \u201cobsession\u201d with the case. Attorney Joe Tacopina told Billboard magazine that Judge Genece Brinkley is \u201cenamored\u201d with Meek after he recorded a song that mentioned her by name. Tacopina also states that Brinkley has shown up at Mill\u2019s court-ordered community service and even requested that Mill drop Roc Nation as his management and sign with a local manager with whom she has a relationship.\n\nCelebrities and activists have spoken out against the unusually harsh sentence. Billboard reports that Philadelphia Eagles safety Malcolm Jennings, known for his social activism against injustice and mass incarceration, plans to attend the rally, as well as 76ers legend Julius \u201cDr. J\u201d Erving. Philly native, and top five emcee of all time (fight me) and The Root 100 honoree who missed the party Black Thought also lent his support for the march.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeek Mill is imprisoned at Camp Hill State Correctional Institution.

Though Meek exposed Drizzy for employing ghostwriters\u2014a damning accusation in the world of real hip-hop\u2014Drake\u2019s legions of postpubescent female fans didn\u2019t seem to care that he\u2019s a bona fide goddamn fraud.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA year later, homie Robert Rihmeek Williams somehow managed to haplessly trip into another beef with the Game, dusty Philly street rapper Beanie Sigel and useless dancehall queen Sean Kingston in a cavalcade of messiness that sounds as if it was cooked up in a game of Cards Against Humanity.\n\nIf Drake\u2019s response tracks (one of which was nominated for a Grammy) were physical entities, they\u2019d evaporate upon touching water. But Game curb-stomped Meek so bad that Nicki Minaj is probably having earnest conversations with her mama about how to proceed in this life. All of Meek\u2019s responses have been trash-bag, and his loss in both battles is uncontested by anyone who didn\u2019t carry him in utero.\n\nBut at least bars (or things resembling them) were exchanged\u2014a significant occurrence in an age when they seem to matter progressively less.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019d hate for the younger generation to look at today\u2019s rap \u201cbeef\u201d and think that\u2019s what it was always like. Grabbing a notepad and stepping in the studio with bellicose bars of fury has been replaced with bitching via 140 characters on Twitter, which is the rap-beef equivalent of showing your support for a tragedy with a flag filter.\n\nWhile there are now many who weren\u2019t yet drawing breath when rap beef became a significant part of hip-hop. There have been many throughout the past three-and-a-half decades or so, but these are my favorites:\n\nJadakiss vs. Beanie Sigel\n\nThanks to his little tangle with Meek Mill and the Game (not to mention a quasi-coherent appearance in a BET Hip-Hop Awards cypher and squabbling with Charlamagne on The Breakfast Club), One-Lung Beans is kinda, sorta back in the public spotlight now. In the year the towers fell, though, he was an East Coast rap titan who got into a bar-trading beef with peer Jadakiss, thanks to a stupid misunderstanding. I wouldn\u2019t have put one emcee over the other in relation to skills back then, but Kiss caught the L when Beans murdered him on his own beat. Winner: Beanie Sigel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n50 Cent vs. Ja Rule\n\nAs much as I loathed 50 Cent in the midaughts for being a power-hungry douche canoe with two overrated albums, it was impressive to see his crushing influence transform grunt-rap-singing progenitor Ja Rule from a multiplatinum artist into a would-be lettuce supervisor at McDowell\u2019s. Ja\u2019s fall from grace included a two-year bid for gun charges and tax evasion, and a post-prison album that went double Kleenex. While neither man really matters as a rapper in late 2016, Curtis is definitely doing better these days. That they picked the beef back up via Twitter last year is simply a reminder of how sad it is when dusty, 40-something rap niggas settle anything using social media. Winner: 50 Cent.\n\nCommon vs. Ice Cube\n\nUnless it\u2019s playing at my salon while I\u2018m getting a pedicure, I\u2019ll probably never watch the most recent Barbershop film. But I know that Common and Cube are buddy-buddy in the film, and most uninitiated viewers were probably like, \u201cOoh, the guys from Road Trip and Are We There Yet? Awesome sauce!\u201d But heads remember when Rashid suggested in his classic \u201cI Used to Love H.E.R.\u201d that hip-hop fell off when the West Coast went mainstream. Cube\u2019s Westside Connection clapped back with a record that no one remembers, provoking Common\u2019s riposte \u201cThe Bitch in Yoo,\u201d a top five GOAT diss record. Both men have had successful careers since 1996, but from a purely rap standpoint, Com takes it. Check out this good retrospective on the beef. Winner: Common.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoogie Down Productions vs. the Juice Crew\n\nThis is for the gray-haired heads too busy driving their children to basketball practice to check for new hip-hop. The battle between KRS-One\u2019s BDP and MC Shan\u2019s Juice Crew was strictly about staking a claim to hip-hop\u2019s origins. When Shan intimated on \u201cThe Bridge\u201d that hip-hop started in New York City\u2019s Queensbridge projects, BDP responded with \u201cSouth Bronx,\u201d letting cats know about the true birth borough of hip-hop. And so on and so forth it went, with a trading of tracks that, let\u2019s be honest, no one is casually listening to in 2016. From a perspective of career longevity, KRS-One has it, but I can\u2019t rightly say there\u2019s a winner here. If you want a less corny peek into the history of hip-hop than Netflix\u2019s The Get Down could muster, read up on this beef. Winner: Draw.\n\nTupac vs. the Notorious B.I.G.\n\nThe genre\u2019s most culturally impactful beef because it defined a generation of hip-hop and (allegedly) resulted in the death of two hip-hop legends. Books and articles (some more credible than others) have been written on the topic of the Pac-Biggie beef and the years long East Coast-West Coast rap war that culminated in their murders. But while Big was the stronger rapper of the two, by far (fight me), Pac issued the strongest salvo with \u201cHit \u2019Em Up\u201d and the extremely disrespectful accompanying video. Back when it was OK to rap about banging someone else\u2019s wife and not expect a Salon.com think piece condemning it. Winner: Tupac.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nN.W.A vs. Ice Cube\n\nProof that you don\u2019t alienate the LeBron of your team without negative consequences. Anyone who knows what he\u2019s talking about will tell you that N.W.A would not have been the powerhouse it was without Cube. When O\u2019Shea found out he was getting bent over on royalties (with no Vaseline), he left the group, which in turn took shots at him on wax. Cube ended the bullshit with \u201cNo Vaseline,\u201d a scathing indictment of a whole crew of\u2014let\u2019s be honest\u2014fake gangsta-ass niggas. Folks don\u2019t remember what N.W.A said about Cube, but everyone remembers \u201cNo Vaseline,\u201d performed to great effect in Straight Outta Compton. Winner: Ice Cube.\n\nJay Z vs. Nas\n\nThe gold standard for rap beef, mainly because the two rappers co-owned New York\u2014and, by extension, hip-hop\u2014in 2001, when they stopped taking little pot shots at each other and went hard body. They are also arguably the two strongest emcees to engage in a war of bars with each other.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTakeover\u201d is a hot, early-era Kanye West track from Jay\u2019s second-best album, but \u201cEther\u201d reminded everyone that Nas is the superior rapper. Hov was so butt-hurt over the perceived loss that he crafted \u201cSuper Ugly,\u201d a completely outta-line diss track that makes the Drake-Cudi business seem like light work and even provoked Jay\u2019s mama to have him apologize publicly.\n\nDespite squashing their beef, they\u2019ve yet to create the classic joint album we all wanted\u2014something their egos probably won\u2019t abide. It\u2019s been a long time since there were two truly dope mainstream rappers who could craft a meaningful rivalry like this; it would be akin to Kendrick Lamar going to war with \u2026 some dude we don\u2019t know exists yet.

On Wednesday, after tens of thousands of students walked out of schools across the nation in solidarity with Douglas High students\u2014and to protest negligent and reckless gun laws that place their lives at risk every single day\u2014I sat in the parking lot of a Baskin-Robbins trying to teach my son, who is on spring break, how to survive an encounter with public servants who are sworn to keep him safe.\n\n\n\nSome of the white Douglas students have voiced similar, if not identical, thoughts: For the first time, they feel unsafe in supposedly safe places. For the first time, they realize that the U.S. government does not value their lives over guns. For the first time, they feel compelled to stand up, walk out and demand change, because they know their lives depend on it.\n\n\n\nNot for the first time, I wondered where in the world is safe for my sons.\n\n\n\nIt is not in schools where they can be beaten to death and rolled up in a gym mat, their assailants never brought to justice.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is not in schools where security officers can violently flip them over in their desks.\n\n\n\nIt is not in schools where white predators can sexually assault them in the locker room and hurl racist slurs at them in the classroom.\n\n\n\nIt is not in schools where white teens can lynch them and have law enforcement protect their white supremacist attackers.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is not in schools where black students face discriminatory punitive action.\n\n\n\nThey are not safe in parks.\n\n\n\nThey aren\u2019t safe walking home.\n\n\n\nThey aren\u2019t safe swimming.\n\n\n\nThey aren\u2019t safe listening to music.\n\n\n\nThey aren\u2019t safe leaving a party.\n\nThey aren\u2019t safe sleeping in their homes.\n\nThey aren\u2019t safe asking for help.\n\nAnd as we witnessed with the peaceful protests in the wake of Baltimore police officers leaving Freddie Gray\u2019s neck nearly severed from his spine, without the canopy of whiteness, my sons aren\u2019t safe organizing walkouts to protest state-sanctioned violence and injustice, either.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll of the students around the country\u2014including the black and brown students in Broward County, Fla., who walked out yesterday\u2014are doing something revolutionary. Despite allegedly being mocked and threatened by some so-called educators for walking out, they continued to stand their ground. They continued to demand that their safety be prioritized, and they have taken to the streets to do so.\n\n\n\nStill, many people have asked the question: Where was the outpouring of public support when black children were being teargassed in Ferguson, Mo.? We have wondered how Oprah Winfrey dared to call the Douglas students \u201cfreedom riders\u201d when she had nothing but criticism for Black Lives Matter. We listened as former President Barack Obama said that these students are whom the nation has been waiting for, that he had their backs. As if black youth have not been risking their lives to protest the state-sanctioned gun violence of police with no unequivocal support from the White House. As if some of the Douglas students have not credited the Black Lives Matter movement as the blueprint for their fight against injustice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is a reason that BLM can serve as the blueprint: because whiteness is the monster that stalks us, haunts us, kills us all\u2014just some more than others. Still, there has been no reckoning with white, male violence, slightly more emphasis placed on male. We know that with mass murder, particularly in public places, the shooters are overwhelmingly white, cisgender, heterosexual men, some with a history of intimate-partner and family violence. We know that they have been neurodiverse, meaning neither mental illness nor mental disability have been determining factors across the board despite the ableist fearmongering that would warn us otherwise.\n\nAs for school shooters specifically, most have been white boys or white men\u2014approximately 90 percent\u2014so if we know one thing, it should be this: We cannot afford to divorce whiteness from any conversation around gun violence. We cannot erase police officers from conversations around school and gun violence.\n\nDeep down, we know that all children don\u2019t matter in this great, white nation of ours, even though our children matter to us. We know that when our children go to school, the violence is already lurking inside of the walls.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet here we are, rightfully cheering on the beauty of this movement, marveling at the power of it, holding on to what feels like tide-shifting change. Hoping against hope that this time, unlike Sandy Hook, legislators might be so moved by the bodies of slain white children that they pass laws to keep all of our children safe when they walk through doors to learn\u2014doors that almost 60 years ago, black children had to face white supremacist violence just to enter.\n\nI, as have many people, cried as I saw children of all races and ethnicities take to the streets without militarized police and dogs breathing down their necks. I cried because it felt transformative.\n\n\n\nI cried because I know that if the predominant narrative focused on black students who organized walkouts in Broward County, mainstream public support would be reduced to a whisper, and the racist Chicago dog whistle would take center stage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs I looked at my son, my baby, in the backseat playing his game, unaware of the monsters in our midst, I was left with a burning question.\n\nHow do we create a world where proximity to whiteness isn\u2019t the only thing forcing those in positions of power to give a damn\u2014or pretend to give a damn\u2014whether black children live or die?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe must be intentional about naming white, male violence\u2014indeed, whiteness itself\u2014as a structural weapon that must be destroyed, because strengthening reckless, flimsy gun laws alone won\u2019t save black children.\n\nIf a brutal history that is not yet past has taught us anything, let it be that.", "keywords": ["know", "lives", "schools", "arent", "white", "students", "walk", "black", "children", "safe", "violence", "safety"], "polarity": 0.0789193702676849, "subjectivity": 0.34247636882468346},

And after that an administrator at a University. And I ran a summer camp one summer. And before any of that happened, I was a school student for 17 years. My point? I know what bullying looks like. I know what it tastes like. (Unseasoned meatloaf.) I know what it smells like. (Chlorine.) I'm an expert in detecting and acknowledging bullying. And what rappers \u2014 and rap fans \u2014 are doing to Meek Mill right now qualifies as bullying. You all are bullying Meek Mill, and you should be ashamed of yourselves.\n\n\"So\" I hear you saying to yourself in my head right now \"how does Meek Mill qualify? He's rich, he's famous, he has a banging girlfriend, and he's homies with Beanie Sigel \u2014 qualities that should make him impervious to bullying.\" And you're right. On paper, Young Rameek is a very unlikely candidate for bullying. But his status hasn't prevented him from falling victim to what bullies do. Even Jewish-Canadian bullies with Carlito Brigante's beard. Which is find a person's sensitive/weak spot, and continue picking at and probing and bringing attention to it. In Meek's case, it's that he's a battle rapper \u2014 a guy who made his bones in street freestyle battles in Philadelphia \u2014 who's just not good at battle rapping.\n\nIt's the cruelest of ironies, really. It's like a kid who got a reputation for being a great boxer. And then you learn that he has no arms. Which makes you wonder how the hell he even got that rep. (Was he just boxing other armless men? Is shoulder boxing a thing in Philly?) But, although he possesses nan arm, he still has that reputation. Which is why it's not considered bullying when bullies like The Game and Drake mess with him. Despite the fact that it's been proven time and time and time and time and time and time and time again that there's absolutely nothing he can do to defend himself. Because listening to a Meek Mill diss track is like watching an armless man fight James Harrison.\n\nSo, if you care at all about setting a good example for our children, lets stop the bullying of Meek Mill now. We need to let him know that we're there for him. That we won't stand by and allow this defenseless 29-year-old to be bullied. And that it will get better.

How about he come to Chicago to talk about gun violence? How about he come to a news station that isn\u2019t Fox News to discuss his broken-down and ineffective policies?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe president has always been a bitch. It\u2019s the reason that real decorated war hero Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) refers to the president of lower two states\u2014looking at you, Georgia and Florida\u2014as a \u201cfive-deferment draft dodger\u201d and \u201ccadet bone spurs.\u201d\n\nTrump is not tough. In fact, he\u2019s not even remotely tough. Trump is the dude who comes to the basketball court in a full official NBA shorts set to talk about how, when he was younger, he used to dunk on guys, but he never plays. He\u2019s the guy at the barbershop who claims that he\u2019s slept with every woman but who everyone knows is really lonely. He\u2019s the guy who goes golfing and cheats.\n\nSeriously, it\u2019s one thing to add a little Lawry\u2019s to your stories when you\u2019re sitting in the barbershop or on the basketball court; it\u2019s another to tip a trough of seasoning onto a national tragedy when you\u2019re the president. This is a time for grieving, and I wish someone would yank the president\u2019s comb-over and hip him to how to behave. Now isn\u2019t the time for this male-bravado bullshit while Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School students are still struggling to make it to class.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeventeen students and teachers were mercilessly gunned down, and the president has not only defended the National Rifle Association, guns, gun owners and NRA spokespeople but has also called for some teachers to be trained in taking down a school shooter. And now he\u2019s playing cowboy behind his Secret Service.\n\nCut the shit, draft dodger.\n\nAnd Trump didn\u2019t stop there. He also bashed the armed officer who didn\u2019t rush into the building to confront the shooter when he heard the shots. He called the officer\u2019s actions \u201cfrankly disgusting\u201d and criticized several deputies who failed to immediately enter the school, telling the governors that the law enforcement officers \u201cweren\u2019t exactly Medal of Honor winners.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow dare Trump criticize the police officer who didn\u2019t run into the school to take down the shooter! The officer could\u2019ve saved lives and he froze up. It happens, and I know that this man is going to beat himself up way more than the president tried to on Monday. He\u2019s already resigned from the force. But I don\u2019t know what\u2019s more cowardly\u2014not running into the school when you hear shooting, or beating someone up after the fact when you haven\u2019t done one remotely heroic thing in your life.\n\nIf anything, the officer\u2019s inaction should be proof that the president\u2019s harebrained Acme scheme of arming teachers is really fucking stupid. If an armed officer couldn\u2019t confront the shooter, then what makes the president think that a teacher would?

Taye made headlines and our shit list when he said he doesn\u2019t want his biracial son to be referred to as \u201cBlack.\u201d I\u2019m always bewildered when stars feel like they need to trumpet their half-cocked opinions to the masses like anyone is checking for real talk from Taye Diggs. Personally, I was tired of hearing all of my homeboys constantly wonder when the dude who was friends with Brown Sugar-era Sanaa Lathan\u2014but never tried to hit \u2014 would finally release his philosophies on race and ethnicity. I can logically believe that a man with a white wife isn\u2019t necessarily filled with self-hate, but when that man effectively says, \u201cI don\u2019t want my son to be viewed in the same way the world views me, and my father and his father\u2026\u201d I think someone should step in and say, \u201cYou know they\u2019re recording this, right? People can hear you.\u201d We heard you loud and clear, Taye. That\u2019s why we stopped messing with you.\n\nAnyway, thinking about the Diggs made me think about who else would be on this list. Who else did the Congregation of Negros Collective decide to boot off the island this year?\n\nMeek Mills He got bodied by a singing nigga. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s the reason. I know it\u2019s shallow and petty, but if you get beat down by anyone, and that person\u2019s next move is to release a video doing the white-boy shuffle in an empty room wearing a cardigan and Dockers, we can\u2019t fuck with you anymore. I\u2019m gonna reveal a secret to you all: Drake\u2019s beatdown of Meek sent the dark-skinned brother community into a tailspin. First, Steph Curry wins the NBA MVP, then this. One minute Meek was the hottest, hardest rapper, on the biggest tour in hip hop (or his girl\u2019s tour), and then, poof he fucked it all up. On Twitter! It\u2019s almost like his homey Will Smith waved that light pen from \u201cMen in Black\u201d in front of our eyes and Meek was erased from our memories and Nikki Minaj\u2019s vagina history. Meek, you\u2019re from Philly, dog. You\u2019ve dropped below Will Smith on the totem pole of hard-ass Philly niggas to somewhere between Charli Baltimore and Lee Daniels. Speaking of Philly\u2026\n\nBill Cosby This was a hard year for Pill Bill. When decades-old allegations of rape resurfaced, it seemed like Black people were going to ride with Bill for a minute. Those of us not offended by his \u201cpull up your pants\u201d rants were going to stick up for the man who laced our childhood with memories of Mushmouth and fine-ass Lisa Bonet and pudding pops (niggas wasn\u2019t fucking with pudding before our Uncle Bill made it cool). The Black narrative was, \u201cThey\u201d were trying to set him up, because he was going to buy NBC, or start the first Black-owned network with Oprah, or resurrect the corpse of Michael Jackson and Sojourner Truth or some other unbelievable shit. We thought it was just another conspiracy until allegations started coming out of the woodwork like roaches when you turn out the lights at Wiz Khalifa\u2019s house (I don\u2019t care how clean he is, or where he lives, Wiz just looks like he has roaches at the crib). After Jill Scott took back her Twitter rant, the only people left standing in Bill\u2019s corner were Camille, Theo and Rudy (I know, but to Black America those are their real names). Even Vanessa abandoned ship, although it\u2019s still just a case of He said/She said. She said. She said. She said. She said. She said. She said. She said. (Add 42 more)\n\nDonald Trump This list is not just limited to Black people. We used to love Donald Trump, because, like many people we fuck with, The Donald likes gaudy gold shit, owns a lot of flashy cars while living in an apartment, and he loves to brag about how he\u2019s getting money and bad bitches. Now that I think about it \u2014 Trump might be a gangster rapper. Anyway, Donald Trump ran for President and went full Pat Buchanan on us. The truth is, Black people are used to finding out their white friend is secretly racist, but Trump went from walling out and rounding up Mexicans to registering Muslims to okaying the beating of a Black Lives Matter protester. Say what you will about the Orange Fuhrer\u2019s lack of a plan for immigration reform, but his racism is comprehensive as hell. We just can\u2019t fuck with him anymore.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFuture If you tied me up, held a rusty knife to my penis and told me you\u2019d cut it off unless I named a Future song, I couldn\u2019t do it. I don\u2019t even know if Future is a rapper or a singer. The only thing I know about Future is that it\u2019s widely agreed that he\u2019s a fuckboy. I can\u2019t say what I would do if I had to listen to Ciara sing every day, so I have a place of sympathy for Future, but having Twitter fights and throwing baby mama shade in the press seems very bitch-nigga-ish to me. Plus, you have to have impeccable fuckboy credentials for a woman to leave you for a man who\u2019s giving her no D. But, you know, they say it\u2019s not the size of the boat\u2026\n\nThats what I\u2019d have to keep telling myself after my kidnappers found out I didn\u2019t know any Future songs.\n\nStephen A Smith We liked Serial-Sayer-of-Stupid-Shit Stephen A. Smith (that\u2019s his official title) before he started building his collection of I\u2019m-smarter-than-you-stupid-niggas idiotic quotes and hyperbolic synonyms. Stephen is one of those people who thinks that intelligence is determined by the number of syllables he can cram into a sentence. First it was his statement that some women get their asses beat because they provoke men. Then it was his Cosby-esque defense of Martin O\u2019Malley and \u201cAll Lives Matter\u201d by pointing the finger at Black people. He finally hit an all time low when Kevin Durant called him out for blatantly lying, and Smith\u2019s only defense was to threaten Durant on live TV. Black people took that offense like when a bully picks on the quiet kid in class: Why is he picking on KD? You know Kevin don\u2019t bother nobody, so Black people don\u2019t fuck with Stephen A. Smith.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRaven Symone - Raven\u2019s ghetto pass was actually revoked in 2014 when she told Oprah that she wasn\u2019t Black or African American, but we kinda let her slide because she was Olivia on the Cosby show, she hung with Mr. Cooper and she was so Raven. We gave her the \u201cGreat Value\u201d brand version of the benefit of the doubt we gave Cosby for forming so many of our childhood memories, but she couldn\u2019t stop herself. We had our collective side-eye watching and waiting for her to \u2014 in the words of her very own father \u2014 say \u201csome dumb shit\u201d and she didn\u2019t disappoint. After saying she would discriminate against someone who had a \u201cBlack name\u201d and then defending the news anchor who said Michelle Obama looked like an ape, we crossed her off the list of friends who can come to the cookout, and the list of people we fuck with.\n\nBen Carson - Remember when Cuba Gooding, Jr. \u2014 another dude we sorta don\u2019t fuck with - played Ben Carson in Gifted Hands and Carson became Black History trivia? We liked the soft-spoken medical genius then, but we didn\u2019t know Ben was a right-wing conservative who went around trying to stab people in the dick while concocting theories about the pyramids being built by historical Jews as self-rising flour. Ben\u2019s litany of falsehoods have been well-catalogued, but after Ben tried to convince us that free health care is worse than slavery and that he saved white people during the 1968 race riots, we left Ben alone.

While we are led to believe that the most dangerous individuals in this country are those who read the Koran, lack a Social Security number or have dark skin, white male domestic terrorists go unnamed and unchallenged.\n\n\n\nThough you would be hard-pressed to hear it articulated in mainstream-media outlets, far-right violent extremists have made up 74 percent of officially designated terrorist attacks in the U.S. since 9/11. And this does not even include the increasing number of ostensibly nonideological mass shooters who fit a now well-known profile: angry white men, often with histories of domestic abuse, who enjoy unfettered access to firearms. Though our president, the National Rifle Association and Congress, which does its bidding, would certainly prefer to see these individuals as mentally ill lone wolves, it seems abundantly clear that they represent a now growing cultural movement within our country: a loose brotherhood of suicidal copycats, inspired to express their anger through mass murder with easily accessible tools.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany will balk at the notion that white male violence goes \u201cunchallenged.\u201d After all, it was a white man who exchanged gunfire with the Sutherland Springs, Texas, killer, and there have been countless white people who have heroically intervened to capture white killers and attend to their victims. What we are referring to here, however, is not the bravery and good intentions of individual people but the systemic means by which our policymakers either target or ignore different forms of violence.\n\nA whole federal government office has been opened to hear the voices of those affected by the crimes of undocumented immigrants, even though immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than the general public; a blanket ban has been proposed on Muslims from half a dozen countries, even though such a ban would have saved no lives over the last 20 years; a multibillion-dollar border wall has been proposed, even though \u201csecure border\u201d advocates widely acknowledge that a wall will make minimal difference. And when it comes to urban gun violence, rather than prescribe proven strategies to reduce shootings, the bipartisan solution over the last 40 years has been to lock up black and brown men in droves.\n\nThis obsession with blaming the \u201cother\u201d has so consumed white leaders that even when white men kill innocent white children in schools and churches, or when a white male supremacist runs over and kills a white woman protesting white supremacy, many seem incapable of absorbing or naming what is happening right before their eyes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe bottom line is that a federal government largely made up of white men seems to have real difficulty acknowledging white male violence. The GOP battered President Barack Obama over his refusal to use the term \u201cIslamic terror,\u201d and yet both Democratic and Republican leaders seem to have a strange nervous tick when it is time to name \u201cwhite domestic terror.\u201d Truth be told, even politicians of color\u2014nourished on a lifelong diet of white movie heroes, Eurocentric school curricula and images of a blond, blue-eyed Jesus\u2014seem conditioned to accept the notion that only \u201cMuslim\u201d terror is real terror.\n\nThe result is that the NRA-backed GOP leaders\u2019 main prescription for keeping us safe is to purchase more guns, somehow trying to convince us that a safe and sane society is one where schoolteachers, church deacons and single mothers must carry pistols and be prepared to engage in impromptu firefights with AR-15-toting lunatics.\n\nSimultaneously, the vast majority of Democratic leaders enthusiastically fund anti-terrorist efforts abroad while remaining silent about the true nature of much of the violence at home, with images of Islamic extremists and black \u201csuperpredators\u201d apparently still dominating their imaginations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnly when our government has launched a \u201cwar on white supremacy\u201d and a \u201cwar on gun violence\u201d will we have a true \u201cwar on terror\u201d and become convinced that our safety is truly its main concern.\n\nThe Rev.

Last week, in a piece I wrote for EBONY, I stated that Meek Mill has absolutely no chance to win this beef with Drake. Mainly because he just does not have the particular skillset necessary for this type of battle.\n\n\n\nMeek Mill\u2019s problem is that he\u2019s just not equipped with the skills necessary to succeed with this. Although he became popular through battle rapping\u2026 he wasn\u2019t actually particularly good at it. He\u2019s not particularly clever or witty; he doesn\u2019t have particularly humorous punchlines; and no one in the history of history has ever raved about a Mill metaphor. He spits drug/murder bars. And often sounds like he\u2019s trying to speak to someone while a blender is running. On a helicopter. Which is great for the type of Scream Trap Rap he creates. He\u2019ll always get play in strip clubs and on crossfit playlists. But, if attempting to go head-to-head with the current king of the hip-hop hill, you need more than murder bars. So now he\u2019s in an unwinnable feud where everyone\u2014even those on his side\u2014is aware it\u2019s an unwinnable feud. The only way for him to beat Drake at this point would be to literally beat Drake up.\n\nThis was (partially) false. It is true that Meek Mill doesn't have the facility or lyrical ingenuity to compete here. He is, to put it plainly, overmatched. But that's the thing. He's so overmatched, so out of his range, and so thoroughly defeated at this point that Drake continuing to mount an offense against him can \u2014 and, likely, will \u2014 backfire on him. Because when you're up 70 points in the third quarter, you call off the full-court press. Even if your crowd is still cheering for every basket. Because the type of people still cheering for you when you're up 70 and still pressing are the exact same people who'll cheer for the other team if you ever happen to be down 70.\n\nBasically, you don't do what Drake did at the OVO Fest.\n\nI get it, though. Meek Mill barked up the wrong tree. And that sound we're hearing is a thousand trees falling on him. Will Smith teleportated from Venus to take part in the fun. Kanye West fucking smiled! Even Whataburger took a break from hocking bacon-wrapped skunk meat to join in. And the expiration date on his relationship with Nicki Minaj just went from \"raw meat still in the fridge\" to \"raw meat on the sidewalk.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, knowing the momentum and the zeitgeist is clearly on his side, Drake went full Mean Girl. Coming out to \"Back to Back\", trolling Meek with t-shirts, and teasing him with an endless stream of memes. Of course, we (myself included) lapped it up. Because, while petty, some of that shit was funny. But there's a very particular type of arrogance that cultivates and is cultivated by that type of performative overkill; the type of arrogance that leads someone to believe they're truly untouchable. Truly unfuckwitable.\n\nAnd yes, that was overkill. With the release of \"Back to Back\" \u2014 and the reception it received \u2014 and Meek Mill's release of \"Wanna Know\" \u2014 and the reception that received, Drake had won already. Meek Mill was done. Dead. And now Drake is riding the wind and peeing on his corpse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut winds eventually shift. They always do. And when they do, that same pee might splash you in the face.

On Wednesday, after tens of thousands of students walked out of schools across the nation in solidarity with Douglas High students\u2014and to protest negligent and reckless gun laws that place their lives at risk every single day\u2014I sat in the parking lot of a Baskin-Robbins trying to teach my son, who is on spring break, how to survive an encounter with public servants who are sworn to keep him safe.\n\n\n\nSome of the white Douglas students have voiced similar, if not identical, thoughts: For the first time, they feel unsafe in supposedly safe places. For the first time, they realize that the U.S. government does not value their lives over guns. For the first time, they feel compelled to stand up, walk out and demand change, because they know their lives depend on it.\n\n\n\nNot for the first time, I wondered where in the world is safe for my sons.\n\n\n\nIt is not in schools where they can be beaten to death and rolled up in a gym mat, their assailants never brought to justice.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is not in schools where security officers can violently flip them over in their desks.\n\n\n\nIt is not in schools where white predators can sexually assault them in the locker room and hurl racist slurs at them in the classroom.\n\n\n\nIt is not in schools where white teens can lynch them and have law enforcement protect their white supremacist attackers.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is not in schools where black students face discriminatory punitive action.\n\n\n\nThey are not safe in parks.\n\n\n\nThey aren\u2019t safe walking home.\n\n\n\nThey aren\u2019t safe swimming.\n\n\n\nThey aren\u2019t safe listening to music.\n\n\n\nThey aren\u2019t safe leaving a party.\n\nThey aren\u2019t safe sleeping in their homes.\n\nThey aren\u2019t safe asking for help.\n\nAnd as we witnessed with the peaceful protests in the wake of Baltimore police officers leaving Freddie Gray\u2019s neck nearly severed from his spine, without the canopy of whiteness, my sons aren\u2019t safe organizing walkouts to protest state-sanctioned violence and injustice, either.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll of the students around the country\u2014including the black and brown students in Broward County, Fla., who walked out yesterday\u2014are doing something revolutionary. Despite allegedly being mocked and threatened by some so-called educators for walking out, they continued to stand their ground. They continued to demand that their safety be prioritized, and they have taken to the streets to do so.\n\n\n\nStill, many people have asked the question: Where was the outpouring of public support when black children were being teargassed in Ferguson, Mo.? We have wondered how Oprah Winfrey dared to call the Douglas students \u201cfreedom riders\u201d when she had nothing but criticism for Black Lives Matter. We listened as former President Barack Obama said that these students are whom the nation has been waiting for, that he had their backs. As if black youth have not been risking their lives to protest the state-sanctioned gun violence of police with no unequivocal support from the White House. As if some of the Douglas students have not credited the Black Lives Matter movement as the blueprint for their fight against injustice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is a reason that BLM can serve as the blueprint: because whiteness is the monster that stalks us, haunts us, kills us all\u2014just some more than others. Still, there has been no reckoning with white, male violence, slightly more emphasis placed on male. We know that with mass murder, particularly in public places, the shooters are overwhelmingly white, cisgender, heterosexual men, some with a history of intimate-partner and family violence. We know that they have been neurodiverse, meaning neither mental illness nor mental disability have been determining factors across the board despite the ableist fearmongering that would warn us otherwise.\n\nAs for school shooters specifically, most have been white boys or white men\u2014approximately 90 percent\u2014so if we know one thing, it should be this: We cannot afford to divorce whiteness from any conversation around gun violence. We cannot erase police officers from conversations around school and gun violence.\n\nDeep down, we know that all children don\u2019t matter in this great, white nation of ours, even though our children matter to us. We know that when our children go to school, the violence is already lurking inside of the walls.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet here we are, rightfully cheering on the beauty of this movement, marveling at the power of it, holding on to what feels like tide-shifting change. Hoping against hope that this time, unlike Sandy Hook, legislators might be so moved by the bodies of slain white children that they pass laws to keep all of our children safe when they walk through doors to learn\u2014doors that almost 60 years ago, black children had to face white supremacist violence just to enter.\n\nI, as have many people, cried as I saw children of all races and ethnicities take to the streets without militarized police and dogs breathing down their necks. I cried because it felt transformative.\n\n\n\nI cried because I know that if the predominant narrative focused on black students who organized walkouts in Broward County, mainstream public support would be reduced to a whisper, and the racist Chicago dog whistle would take center stage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs I looked at my son, my baby, in the backseat playing his game, unaware of the monsters in our midst, I was left with a burning question.\n\nHow do we create a world where proximity to whiteness isn\u2019t the only thing forcing those in positions of power to give a damn\u2014or pretend to give a damn\u2014whether black children live or die?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe must be intentional about naming white, male violence\u2014indeed, whiteness itself\u2014as a structural weapon that must be destroyed, because strengthening reckless, flimsy gun laws alone won\u2019t save black children.\n\nIf a brutal history that is not yet past has taught us anything, let it be that.", "keywords": ["know", "lives", "schools", "arent", "white", "students", "walk", "black", "children", "safe", "violence", "safety"], "polarity": 0.0789193702676849, "subjectivity": 0.34247636882468346},

I thought we were going to do an explainer yesterday, but you seem so distracted. What\u2019s going on?\n\nI\u2019m sorry. I was keeping an eye on Florida\u2019s House of Representatives all day. House members passed a school-safety/gun control bill and sent it to the governor for his signature.\n\nThat\u2019s great! Maybe they\u2019ve finally seen the light and can pass legislation that will put a stop to all these mass shootings!\n\nI hear you, but this bill will probably mean more dead black kids.\n\nWait ... but you just said it\u2019s a gun control and school-safety law. By definition, that means it will control guns and make schools safe, right?\n\nThis is Florida, man. You can buy a boa constrictor at a convenience store in Florida. Don\u2019t forget, the 9/11 hijackers took flying lessons in Florida and it didn\u2019t raise any red flags when they told their instructor, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about the landing part.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNothing in Florida makes any sense.\n\nThe Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act raises the minimum age to buy a weapon to 18, allows citizens to \u201cred flag\u201d people with mental health problems and enacts a three-day waiting period on most weapons, all of which are needed. But it does nothing to curb the sale of military-style weapons. It does not close loopholes regarding purchasing guns at gun shows or in private sales.\n\nBut even more troubling than the previously mentioned exemptions, the new law creates a program that will result in armed school employees.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy is that a bad thing? You know what they say: The only person who can stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.\n\nFirst of all, almost every legitimate study shows that when more guns are present, more people die. A 2015 study of FBI and national crime by the Violence Policy Center (pdf) concluded that people are more likely to cause an accidental death than prevent a crime when pulling a gun in self-defense. The Washington Post reports that for every justifiable homicide using a gun, there are 34 criminal homicides, 78 gun suicides and two accidental deaths. A 2013 study by the FBI (pdf) even shows that more active shooters are stopped by unarmed citizens.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, no one ever says that thing about \u201cbad guys with guns being stopped by good guys with guns.\u201d It\u2019s a National Rifle Association marketing slogan. But then again, I\u2019ve also never seen anyone eating a Chicken McNugget while muttering the catchphrase, \u201cI\u2019m lovin\u2019 it!\u201d\n\nBut you said black kids will die. How do you figure that?\n\nBecause I trust these little-known, seldom-used things called \u201cfacts.\u201d\n\nFor instance, a study by Ohio State University revealed that black students receive harsher punishments than white kids for the same relatively minor infractions. Federal data shows that teachers and schools are four times more likely to suspend black students. Research by the American Psychological Association shows that even away from school, people with darker skin are perceived as bigger, stronger and more threatening than white people the same size.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo whom do you think gun-toting school employees are more likely to shoot?\n\nBlack kids. But I\u2019ve read a little about this legislation. It proposes training, mental health evaluations and drug screenings. Wouldn\u2019t that help?\n\nHas training, drug screenings and mental health evaluations stopped police from killing black people disproportionately?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGood point. But what about the fact that they could go to jail for shooting the wrong kid? You\u2019ve gotta admit that the law wouldn\u2019t shield anyone from prosecution.\n\nHow is that different from any other self-protection legislation like Florida\u2019s \u201cStand your ground\u201d law? In a \u201cStand your ground\u201d study that looked solely at cases in Florida, researchers discovered that between 2005 and 2013, Florida juries were twice as likely to convict the perpetrator of a crime against a white person as they were to convict in a crime against a person of color.\n\n\u201cThese results are similar to pre-civil-rights-era statistics, with strict enforcement for crimes when the victim was white and less-rigorous enforcement with the victim is nonwhite,\u201d the report said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you give anyone the legal authority to shoot people, they are always going to shoot black people.\n\nDamn. So if this data is readily available, why would they consider such a stupid law?\n\nBecause Florida legislators don\u2019t care about dead bodies as much as they care about the buckets of cash from the NRA. It\u2019s why the homicide rate has surged 22 percent since the state passed the \u201cStand your ground\u201d law. It\u2019s why Sen. Marco Rubio stood in front of a Parkland, Fla., shooting survivor and explained his loyalty to the NRA by explaining that \u201cpeople buy into\u201d his agenda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo black students are in a lot of danger, huh?\n\nIt\u2019s not just the students. It\u2019s the black school employees, too. The Florida law doesn\u2019t arm classroom teachers, but it allows all of the other school workers to carry weapons if their school district opts in. Traditionally, black people carrying concealed weapons haven\u2019t fared so well, even if the gun is legal.\n\nIn fact, I read a story a couple of years ago about a black school employee who carried a legal firearm. He was a lunchroom worker. He was stopped by the cops, and he informed the officer that he was licensed to carry. I think his name was Philando Castile.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can\u2019t recall how that situation ended up, but I\u2019m sure everything turned out OK.\n\nUmmm ... I think you should go back and ... you know what? Never mind. Look, I know it\u2019s Florida, but come on man. It couldn\u2019t be that bad. Maybe you\u2019re wrong about how dangerous this could turn out to be.\n\nPerhaps. After all, there\u2019s no way the state of Florida would allow an adult to shoot an innocent black kid and get away with it. Especially if the kid wasn\u2019t involved in any kind of crime or threatening the life of anyone around him. That would be incredibly racist. Maybe I\u2019m just overreacting. I probably should call someone who would know better.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWould you happen to have a phone number for George Zimmerman?", "keywords": ["school", "crime", "florida", "means", "white", "shows", "guns", "study", "law", "explained", "teachers", "students", "dead", "black", "armed", "gun"], "polarity": 0.0388758116883117, "subjectivity": 0.46734356210918687},

We watched as you stood there, brown skin shining, braids swinging, voices booming, taking charge and walking in the revolutionary tradition of your ancestors. We saw the fire in your eyes. We felt it burning. Hold on to it.

On Wednesday, after tens of thousands of students walked out of schools across the nation in solidarity with Douglas High students\u2014and to protest negligent and reckless gun laws that place their lives at risk every single day\u2014I sat in the parking lot of a Baskin-Robbins trying to teach my son, who is on spring break, how to survive an encounter with public servants who are sworn to keep him safe.\n\n\n\nSome of the white Douglas students have voiced similar, if not identical, thoughts: For the first time, they feel unsafe in supposedly safe places. For the first time, they realize that the U.S. government does not value their lives over guns. For the first time, they feel compelled to stand up, walk out and demand change, because they know their lives depend on it.\n\n\n\nNot for the first time, I wondered where in the world is safe for my sons.\n\n\n\nIt is not in schools where they can be beaten to death and rolled up in a gym mat, their assailants never brought to justice.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is not in schools where security officers can violently flip them over in their desks.\n\n\n\nIt is not in schools where white predators can sexually assault them in the locker room and hurl racist slurs at them in the classroom.\n\n\n\nIt is not in schools where white teens can lynch them and have law enforcement protect their white supremacist attackers.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is not in schools where black students face discriminatory punitive action.\n\n\n\nThey are not safe in parks.\n\n\n\nThey aren\u2019t safe walking home.\n\n\n\nThey aren\u2019t safe swimming.\n\n\n\nThey aren\u2019t safe listening to music.\n\n\n\nThey aren\u2019t safe leaving a party.\n\nThey aren\u2019t safe sleeping in their homes.\n\nThey aren\u2019t safe asking for help.\n\nAnd as we witnessed with the peaceful protests in the wake of Baltimore police officers leaving Freddie Gray\u2019s neck nearly severed from his spine, without the canopy of whiteness, my sons aren\u2019t safe organizing walkouts to protest state-sanctioned violence and injustice, either.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll of the students around the country\u2014including the black and brown students in Broward County, Fla., who walked out yesterday\u2014are doing something revolutionary. Despite allegedly being mocked and threatened by some so-called educators for walking out, they continued to stand their ground. They continued to demand that their safety be prioritized, and they have taken to the streets to do so.\n\n\n\nStill, many people have asked the question: Where was the outpouring of public support when black children were being teargassed in Ferguson, Mo.? We have wondered how Oprah Winfrey dared to call the Douglas students \u201cfreedom riders\u201d when she had nothing but criticism for Black Lives Matter. We listened as former President Barack Obama said that these students are whom the nation has been waiting for, that he had their backs. As if black youth have not been risking their lives to protest the state-sanctioned gun violence of police with no unequivocal support from the White House. As if some of the Douglas students have not credited the Black Lives Matter movement as the blueprint for their fight against injustice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is a reason that BLM can serve as the blueprint: because whiteness is the monster that stalks us, haunts us, kills us all\u2014just some more than others. Still, there has been no reckoning with white, male violence, slightly more emphasis placed on male. We know that with mass murder, particularly in public places, the shooters are overwhelmingly white, cisgender, heterosexual men, some with a history of intimate-partner and family violence. We know that they have been neurodiverse, meaning neither mental illness nor mental disability have been determining factors across the board despite the ableist fearmongering that would warn us otherwise.\n\nAs for school shooters specifically, most have been white boys or white men\u2014approximately 90 percent\u2014so if we know one thing, it should be this: We cannot afford to divorce whiteness from any conversation around gun violence. We cannot erase police officers from conversations around school and gun violence.\n\nDeep down, we know that all children don\u2019t matter in this great, white nation of ours, even though our children matter to us. We know that when our children go to school, the violence is already lurking inside of the walls.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet here we are, rightfully cheering on the beauty of this movement, marveling at the power of it, holding on to what feels like tide-shifting change. Hoping against hope that this time, unlike Sandy Hook, legislators might be so moved by the bodies of slain white children that they pass laws to keep all of our children safe when they walk through doors to learn\u2014doors that almost 60 years ago, black children had to face white supremacist violence just to enter.\n\nI, as have many people, cried as I saw children of all races and ethnicities take to the streets without militarized police and dogs breathing down their necks. I cried because it felt transformative.\n\n\n\nI cried because I know that if the predominant narrative focused on black students who organized walkouts in Broward County, mainstream public support would be reduced to a whisper, and the racist Chicago dog whistle would take center stage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs I looked at my son, my baby, in the backseat playing his game, unaware of the monsters in our midst, I was left with a burning question.\n\nHow do we create a world where proximity to whiteness isn\u2019t the only thing forcing those in positions of power to give a damn\u2014or pretend to give a damn\u2014whether black children live or die?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe must be intentional about naming white, male violence\u2014indeed, whiteness itself\u2014as a structural weapon that must be destroyed, because strengthening reckless, flimsy gun laws alone won\u2019t save black children.\n\nIf a brutal history that is not yet past has taught us anything, let it be that.", "keywords": ["know", "lives", "schools", "arent", "white", "students", "walk", "black", "children", "safe", "violence", "safety"], "polarity": 0.0789193702676849, "subjectivity": 0.34247636882468346},

For some reason I\u2019m compelled to smack the shit out of this cashier!\u201d\n\nThat said, Betsy DeVos is making quite the strong case. Consider what happened Wednesday when DeVos visited Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.\n\nFrom the Huffington Post:\n\nThe brief visit, which was closed to reporters, came three weeks after the mass shooting that killed 17 students and staff members. DeVos took only a handful of questions at a news conference afterward, not getting into specific details about the visit or what policy proposals she would consider to curb gun violence.\n\nThis sounds pretty damn useless.\n\nMany of the students, some of whom have become activists for gun control in the wake of the shooting, said on social media that DeVos didn\u2019t meet with many students and \u201cbarely\u201d responded to their questions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUseless AF.\n\nCarly Novell, an editor at the student newspaper, the Eagle Eye, said that even student publications were restricted from interacting with DeVos and that \u201cno one followed her.\u201d\n\nUseless infinity.\n\nAnna Fusco, Broward Teachers Union president, who was present during DeVos\u2019 visit, confirmed the students\u2019 accounts, telling HuffPost that \u201cthey didn\u2019t see the purpose of her being there.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThai-style fried rice with shrimp and useless.\n\nTo be fair, DeVos\u2019 entire steez is just one relentless spritz of uselessness.

Meek\u2026you lookin' real baby lotion soft right now. This niggas spends the better part of his days yelling at everybody but now we hear nothing. You're losing, gawd. Amen.\n\n2. \"Back To Back\" is some kind of disrespectful. Drake, you a rude nigga, my nigga.

THAT's how you kick off a dis record, shading a motherfucker before a word is even uttered. I like this move. A lot.\n\n3. The Funk Flex debacle...Meek, if you ain't have a track ready, DON'T LET THE MOUTH OF NEW YORK amp that shit up. Now you just look slow and, dare I say, not like a boss. Rick Ross cannot be happy about this right now. I hate Flex anyway so shit like this just adds fuel to the \"Flex must go\" fire. Quit making yourself a story, b.\n\n4. Quentin Miller was very smart with this tumblr post about the \"ghostwriting\" accusations. You do not bite the hand that feeds you, especially when that hand can probably feed you for the next ten years. Easy money, b. Easy money. Shit, if I was Quentin Miller, I'd have said, \"that \"10 Bands\" reference was me taking my shot at reciting Drake's words but I realized I wasn't as good. I thought I deleted it but somebody got a hold to it and here we are. Fuck whoever did that.\" Barry Bonds ain't never gonna see the inside of a jail because his peoples are loyal as fuck.

But this line right here sums up why Drake wins\u2026\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt's REALLY hard to body a super self-aware nigga with a sense of humor about his place in the world, who also happens to be better at what he does than most other people doing it. Drake is on everybody's record because everybody knows that he sells. You turn the Drake record into a single. Period. There ain't no Drake filler records. Nobody gives a shit that Meek Mill dissed somebody\u2026we only cared cuz he went at Drake and folks wanted to see how he'd respond. We're all happy that Drake IS responding musically because we weren't sure how Drake would respond at all. I know now and my life is better. It aint like Drake dropped the illest dis record of all time (though I do think its a good record), it's more like\u2026damn Drake is actually dropping real dis records. We likey.\n\nNobody really cares about Meek's comeback, we're just all glad that Drake cared enough to respond. More Drake records is better for the world. More Meek records\u2026eh\u2026\n\n6. Poor Meek. Stuck between a dude who makes his songs better and his girlfriend who is a good friend of Drake. But Meek is a rapper so he has to come back, but holy fuck he's taking his time. It's 2015\u2026we're losing interest Meek. You've got like 27 hours tops before niggas are over you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. The dumbest part about this all is that dissing Drake is just stupid anyway. Drake gon' be alright. Two years from now when Meek Mill is working at Starbucks with Vin Baker, Drake will still be releasing albums and making money. Love him or hate him, the boy is talented as fuck. And he knows it.\n\n8. Similarly, this is how you know Drake really does give a shit about Nicki, he clowned Meek while paying deference to Nicki. Hip hop's track record when it comes to women sucks, when it comes to dis tracks and women in niggas lives, it sucks more. Drake went full Drake and respected Nicki while clowning Meek. Good show, Drake. This is why women will continue to support you, beard or no beard.\n\n9. \"Shout out to the boss bitches wifin' niggas\" ~ So disrespectful. But so hilarious.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. I am curious to what Meek is going to come back with. I'm sure it will be a vitriolic dis, where he spews lines about how pussy Drake is and how soft he is and all that shit. Ya know, the things Drake gets clowned on via Twitter daily. And yet Drake is out here winning anyway. I'm not saying Drake is teflon, but most of these niggas out here ain't dumb enough to go at a dude who can 1) actually spit (fuck what ya heard); and 2) get on one of their records and introduce them to the charts. I'm not much of a Meek Mill fan anyway. He's got some hot records obviously. But no Meek Mill in my life isn't really ruining it either. Also, I don't rule out them niggas having a talk somewhere, a moscato summit of sorts, and squashing it for Nicki's sake. But for now, Meek\u2026\n\n\u2026you're on the clock. And the clock is ticking. Bawse.\n\nBONUS:\n\n11. Safaree is probably somewhere smiling his ass off. And by somewhere I mean wondering why he sucks as a rapper. At Starbucks.

However, in recent days, students Josh Gallagher and Connor Dietrich are refuting that narrative, both expressing disgust toward Gard on Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Twitter, Gallagher wrote that Gard \u201ccalled himself a hero, and ... the media portrayed him as a hero when in reality he is the opposite.\u201d\n\nGallagher said that he was in Gard\u2019s class when the fire alarm went off and students started filing out. Then they heard gunshots, and about 15 of them stopped in their tracks before running back toward the classroom.

That\u2019s protocol. We have no choice.\u201d\n\nGard said that he and the students who had gotten into the classroom were huddled in the dark by the desk when they heard loud banging on the door.

On Wednesday, after tens of thousands of students walked out of schools across the nation in solidarity with Douglas High students\u2014and to protest negligent and reckless gun laws that place their lives at risk every single day\u2014I sat in the parking lot of a Baskin-Robbins trying to teach my son, who is on spring break, how to survive an encounter with public servants who are sworn to keep him safe.\n\n\n\nSome of the white Douglas students have voiced similar, if not identical, thoughts: For the first time, they feel unsafe in supposedly safe places. For the first time, they realize that the U.S. government does not value their lives over guns. For the first time, they feel compelled to stand up, walk out and demand change, because they know their lives depend on it.\n\n\n\nNot for the first time, I wondered where in the world is safe for my sons.\n\n\n\nIt is not in schools where they can be beaten to death and rolled up in a gym mat, their assailants never brought to justice.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is not in schools where security officers can violently flip them over in their desks.\n\n\n\nIt is not in schools where white predators can sexually assault them in the locker room and hurl racist slurs at them in the classroom.\n\n\n\nIt is not in schools where white teens can lynch them and have law enforcement protect their white supremacist attackers.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is not in schools where black students face discriminatory punitive action.\n\n\n\nThey are not safe in parks.\n\n\n\nThey aren\u2019t safe walking home.\n\n\n\nThey aren\u2019t safe swimming.\n\n\n\nThey aren\u2019t safe listening to music.\n\n\n\nThey aren\u2019t safe leaving a party.\n\nThey aren\u2019t safe sleeping in their homes.\n\nThey aren\u2019t safe asking for help.\n\nAnd as we witnessed with the peaceful protests in the wake of Baltimore police officers leaving Freddie Gray\u2019s neck nearly severed from his spine, without the canopy of whiteness, my sons aren\u2019t safe organizing walkouts to protest state-sanctioned violence and injustice, either.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll of the students around the country\u2014including the black and brown students in Broward County, Fla., who walked out yesterday\u2014are doing something revolutionary. Despite allegedly being mocked and threatened by some so-called educators for walking out, they continued to stand their ground. They continued to demand that their safety be prioritized, and they have taken to the streets to do so.\n\n\n\nStill, many people have asked the question: Where was the outpouring of public support when black children were being teargassed in Ferguson, Mo.? We have wondered how Oprah Winfrey dared to call the Douglas students \u201cfreedom riders\u201d when she had nothing but criticism for Black Lives Matter. We listened as former President Barack Obama said that these students are whom the nation has been waiting for, that he had their backs. As if black youth have not been risking their lives to protest the state-sanctioned gun violence of police with no unequivocal support from the White House. As if some of the Douglas students have not credited the Black Lives Matter movement as the blueprint for their fight against injustice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is a reason that BLM can serve as the blueprint: because whiteness is the monster that stalks us, haunts us, kills us all\u2014just some more than others. Still, there has been no reckoning with white, male violence, slightly more emphasis placed on male. We know that with mass murder, particularly in public places, the shooters are overwhelmingly white, cisgender, heterosexual men, some with a history of intimate-partner and family violence. We know that they have been neurodiverse, meaning neither mental illness nor mental disability have been determining factors across the board despite the ableist fearmongering that would warn us otherwise.\n\nAs for school shooters specifically, most have been white boys or white men\u2014approximately 90 percent\u2014so if we know one thing, it should be this: We cannot afford to divorce whiteness from any conversation around gun violence. We cannot erase police officers from conversations around school and gun violence.\n\nDeep down, we know that all children don\u2019t matter in this great, white nation of ours, even though our children matter to us. We know that when our children go to school, the violence is already lurking inside of the walls.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet here we are, rightfully cheering on the beauty of this movement, marveling at the power of it, holding on to what feels like tide-shifting change. Hoping against hope that this time, unlike Sandy Hook, legislators might be so moved by the bodies of slain white children that they pass laws to keep all of our children safe when they walk through doors to learn\u2014doors that almost 60 years ago, black children had to face white supremacist violence just to enter.\n\nI, as have many people, cried as I saw children of all races and ethnicities take to the streets without militarized police and dogs breathing down their necks. I cried because it felt transformative.\n\n\n\nI cried because I know that if the predominant narrative focused on black students who organized walkouts in Broward County, mainstream public support would be reduced to a whisper, and the racist Chicago dog whistle would take center stage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs I looked at my son, my baby, in the backseat playing his game, unaware of the monsters in our midst, I was left with a burning question.\n\nHow do we create a world where proximity to whiteness isn\u2019t the only thing forcing those in positions of power to give a damn\u2014or pretend to give a damn\u2014whether black children live or die?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe must be intentional about naming white, male violence\u2014indeed, whiteness itself\u2014as a structural weapon that must be destroyed, because strengthening reckless, flimsy gun laws alone won\u2019t save black children.\n\nIf a brutal history that is not yet past has taught us anything, let it be that.", "keywords": ["know", "lives", "schools", "arent", "white", "students", "walk", "black", "children", "safe", "violence", "safety"], "polarity": 0.0789193702676849, "subjectivity": 0.34247636882468346},

So ... not startling.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter studying a representative cross section of gun owners, researchers found that the people who have an emotional attachment to their guns were 78 percent white and 65 percent male. It must be noted that the sample size was small because\u2014despite widespread American gun ownership\u2014just 3 percent of the population owns half the guns in the country.\n\nRacial anxiety was a big reason for the uptick in gun ownership, according to Angela Stroud, a Northland College sociologist. Stroud went through concealed-weapon applications in Texas and interviewed applicants. She found that many of them wanted to protect their loved ones during the impending race war.\n\nApparently, Barack Obama came to the secret black meeting and told black people to attack the whites. (Wait ... you missed the meeting? It was great. Especially the catering. Best watermelon and Kool-Aid I ever tasted.) According to the report:\n\n...

There is no significant difference in the rate of gun ownership across educational attainment among nonwhites.\n\n\n\nAccording to Pew Research, about 26 percent of white college graduates own guns, compared with 40 percent of high school graduates and 42 percent of people with some college education.

That discussion is too subjective, and no one will ever reach a consensus on any kind of art. Plus, some people have shit taste in music, and I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019m about to argue music with anyone who believes 21 Savage is better than Nas.\n\nFor the sake of this argument, Bruno Mars is not black. He has a mixed racial background that includes Ashkenazi Jew, Puerto Rican and Filipino. One can debate where he fits in the African Diaspora, the meaning of \u201cblackness\u201d or whether race is an artificial construct. I can almost guarantee that if I called him right now and asked him to list his top five macaroni-makers, he\u2019d have to think about it for a minute, and none of the names in his top five would begin with the word \u201caunt.\u201d Black people created every form of American music. But there is a specific, indefinable genre of music that begins with R&B and encompasses hip-hop that we will heretofore refer to as \u201cblack music.\u201d\n\nThe furious debate about Bruno Mars and whether or not he is a cultural appropriator has bubbled beneath the surface of his career for a while. It existed before he remade Earth, Wind & Fire\u2019s \u201cUptown Funk\u201d or Bell Biv DeVoe\u2019s \u201cFinesse.\u201d Even when\u2014\n\nWait ... I\u2019m being told that the previously mentioned songs are Bruno Mars originals. But I\u2019m pretty sure the S.O.S. Band made \u201c24 Karat Magic.\u201d I think it was the B side to \u201cTake Your Time,\u201d so let\u2019s use that as an example. What? That\u2019s an original song, too? OK, I\u2019m going to have to do a little more research on this and get back to you.\n\nBut before Bruno won a Grammy and Meshell Ndegeocello called him a karaoke singer, there were always people who thought that someone put Michael Jackson, Prince and James Brown into a blender with a quarter cup of lukewarm water, a dollop of mayonnaise and a smidge of racial ambiguity, and out came the next pop sensation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe conversation was reignited when this clip from the Grapevine (not this one; the other one) began circling the internet:\n\nSeren Aishitemasu, the woman in the clip makes a convincing argument breaking down why Bruno is a derivative artist who\u2014willingly or not\u2014gets to trade on his racial ambiguity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut does that necessarily mean he is guilty of cultural appropriation?\n\nThere is no universally accepted definition of the term, but it generally relates to the use of the art, artifacts, symbology or anything of cultural significance to a minority or nondominant group of people by a person who is not in that group.\n\nWhat separates cultural appropriation from a cultural exchange or paying homage is when someone \u201cborrows\u201d an item or symbol of cultural significance without acknowledgment, attribution or permission. One of the other hallmarks of appropriation is using someone\u2019s culture to demean, make fun of or diminish it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnderstanding the definition and the power dynamics involved in cultural appropriation is the key to understanding the concept. When Kim Kardashian put cornrows in her hair and called them \u201cBo Derek braids,\u201d it was cultural appropriation because she made no acknowledgment of the culture from which the style came.\n\nAnd yes, black people can be cultural appropriators. When a black woman wore a Native American headdress to Coachella as a costume, she was appropriating by using part of a culture\u2019s sacred ritual as cosplay. In fact, I am often accused of cultural appropriation. When people ask how I can use the white man\u2019s internet and type on a keyboard that a white man invented and not be considered an appropriator, I want to explain to them how stupid they sound, but I don\u2019t because they probably wouldn\u2019t understand the concept.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut when it comes to music and art, cultural appropriation is a tricky thing to decipher. A non-black person\u2019s involvement in a traditionally black art does not rise to the level of appropriation in and of itself. Bruno Mars is 32 years old, meaning that he grew up during a time when hip-hop and R&B ruled the charts as the most popular music in the world. Anyone making popular music in 2018 is\u2014by definition\u2014making black music, regardless of their color.\n\nTo be honest, it is incumbent on white artists to acknowledge that, even if it seems unfair.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 is only doing what Janet Jackson did before her and Diana Ross did before her. But Beyonc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t have to bear the burden of acknowledging that every time she steps onstage because\u2014as a black woman\u2014she is an inheritor of that legacy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, when Taylor Swift makes an album that looks like an unsweetened, gluten-free version of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Lemonade, it comes off as cultural appropriation, even though it is quite possible that Taylor Swift was influenced by the same artists as Queen Bey (although, judging from the fact that Swift looks like she\u2019s doing trigonometry in her head when she\u2019s doing dance choreography, I doubt it).\n\nSome might call it a double standard or reverse racism to demand that Swift and other white artists give a nod to borrowing from black music and culture while not requiring the same of black artists. However, being black means you are born into the legacy of the culture. I can walk into my grandmother\u2019s house and open the refrigerator without asking permission. You cannot.\n\nBut here is the fault line:\n\nBeing a part of a culture\u2014whether one is born into it or not\u2014also comes with the responsibility of being a caretaker of it. If we kept our mouths closed, non-blacks artists would suck our artistic heritage dry without caring what happened to whomever they left in the discarded heap. We gave Justin Timberlake a 2-decade get-out-of-appropriation-free pass. When he was finished doing his 20-years-long impression of an R&B singer, he became a \u201cMan of the Woods\u201d and distanced himself from black music like it was Janet Jackson\u2019s left titty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are black artists who have leaped to Bruno Mars\u2019 defense, saying that he is not guilty of appropriation. As someone who is only marginally aware of his music, every time I have seen him perform, give an interview or receive an award, including the Grammy, he has made sure to acknowledge that he was influenced by black music almost exclusively.\n\nSo, based on the definition of cultural appropriation, is Bruno Mars guilty?\n\nNope.\n\nEvery single word Seren said was correct, but none of it defined cultural appropriation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I have a theory about the people who accuse Bruno Mars of cultural theft:\n\nMaybe they are tired of seeing people like Post Malone take bits of black culture and use them to make derivative, unoriginal content meant to be palatable for white mouths. Perhaps they are tired of seeing more-talented black artists outshone by beige newcomers who pass the paper-bag test and don\u2019t give white people the heebie-jeebies. It is possible that they are overzealous custodians of their culture.\n\nOr maybe they\u2019re just tired of seeing Bruno Mars. Maybe they saw his act when Janelle Mon\u00e1e was doing the same thing for the past decade. Maybe they saw Bruno when he was Chris Brown. Or Bobby Brown. Or James Brown. Or MC Hammer. Or Prince. Or Michael Jackson. Or Janet Jackson.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOr, even if he is always careful to give props, maybe they understand that Kenny G is the best-selling jazz instrumentalist in the modern era, Eminem is the best-selling hip-hop artist of all time and there isn\u2019t a black face in the top five best-selling music artists of all time.\n\nBut they all make black music.\n\nTrust me, they know it.", "keywords": ["mars", "cultural", "dont", "white", "culture", "controversy", "proves", "doing", "music", "artists", "black", "bruno", "appropriation", "understand"], "polarity": 0.02780663780663778, "subjectivity": 0.41541666666666666},

We watched as you stood there, brown skin shining, braids swinging, voices booming, taking charge and walking in the revolutionary tradition of your ancestors. We saw the fire in your eyes.

On Wednesday, after tens of thousands of students walked out of schools across the nation in solidarity with Douglas High students\u2014and to protest negligent and reckless gun laws that place their lives at risk every single day\u2014I sat in the parking lot of a Baskin-Robbins trying to teach my son, who is on spring break, how to survive an encounter with public servants who are sworn to keep him safe.\n\n\n\nSome of the white Douglas students have voiced similar, if not identical, thoughts: For the first time, they feel unsafe in supposedly safe places. For the first time, they realize that the U.S. government does not value their lives over guns. For the first time, they feel compelled to stand up, walk out and demand change, because they know their lives depend on it.\n\n\n\nNot for the first time, I wondered where in the world is safe for my sons.\n\n\n\nIt is not in schools where they can be beaten to death and rolled up in a gym mat, their assailants never brought to justice.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is not in schools where security officers can violently flip them over in their desks.\n\n\n\nIt is not in schools where white predators can sexually assault them in the locker room and hurl racist slurs at them in the classroom.\n\n\n\nIt is not in schools where white teens can lynch them and have law enforcement protect their white supremacist attackers.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is not in schools where black students face discriminatory punitive action.\n\n\n\nThey are not safe in parks.\n\n\n\nThey aren\u2019t safe walking home.\n\n\n\nThey aren\u2019t safe swimming.\n\n\n\nThey aren\u2019t safe listening to music.\n\n\n\nThey aren\u2019t safe leaving a party.\n\nThey aren\u2019t safe sleeping in their homes.\n\nThey aren\u2019t safe asking for help.\n\nAnd as we witnessed with the peaceful protests in the wake of Baltimore police officers leaving Freddie Gray\u2019s neck nearly severed from his spine, without the canopy of whiteness, my sons aren\u2019t safe organizing walkouts to protest state-sanctioned violence and injustice, either.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll of the students around the country\u2014including the black and brown students in Broward County, Fla., who walked out yesterday\u2014are doing something revolutionary. Despite allegedly being mocked and threatened by some so-called educators for walking out, they continued to stand their ground. They continued to demand that their safety be prioritized, and they have taken to the streets to do so.\n\n\n\nStill, many people have asked the question: Where was the outpouring of public support when black children were being teargassed in Ferguson, Mo.? We have wondered how Oprah Winfrey dared to call the Douglas students \u201cfreedom riders\u201d when she had nothing but criticism for Black Lives Matter. We listened as former President Barack Obama said that these students are whom the nation has been waiting for, that he had their backs. As if black youth have not been risking their lives to protest the state-sanctioned gun violence of police with no unequivocal support from the White House. As if some of the Douglas students have not credited the Black Lives Matter movement as the blueprint for their fight against injustice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is a reason that BLM can serve as the blueprint: because whiteness is the monster that stalks us, haunts us, kills us all\u2014just some more than others. Still, there has been no reckoning with white, male violence, slightly more emphasis placed on male. We know that with mass murder, particularly in public places, the shooters are overwhelmingly white, cisgender, heterosexual men, some with a history of intimate-partner and family violence. We know that they have been neurodiverse, meaning neither mental illness nor mental disability have been determining factors across the board despite the ableist fearmongering that would warn us otherwise.\n\nAs for school shooters specifically, most have been white boys or white men\u2014approximately 90 percent\u2014so if we know one thing, it should be this: We cannot afford to divorce whiteness from any conversation around gun violence. We cannot erase police officers from conversations around school and gun violence.\n\nDeep down, we know that all children don\u2019t matter in this great, white nation of ours, even though our children matter to us. We know that when our children go to school, the violence is already lurking inside of the walls.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet here we are, rightfully cheering on the beauty of this movement, marveling at the power of it, holding on to what feels like tide-shifting change. Hoping against hope that this time, unlike Sandy Hook, legislators might be so moved by the bodies of slain white children that they pass laws to keep all of our children safe when they walk through doors to learn\u2014doors that almost 60 years ago, black children had to face white supremacist violence just to enter.\n\nI, as have many people, cried as I saw children of all races and ethnicities take to the streets without militarized police and dogs breathing down their necks. I cried because it felt transformative.\n\n\n\nI cried because I know that if the predominant narrative focused on black students who organized walkouts in Broward County, mainstream public support would be reduced to a whisper, and the racist Chicago dog whistle would take center stage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs I looked at my son, my baby, in the backseat playing his game, unaware of the monsters in our midst, I was left with a burning question.\n\nHow do we create a world where proximity to whiteness isn\u2019t the only thing forcing those in positions of power to give a damn\u2014or pretend to give a damn\u2014whether black children live or die?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe must be intentional about naming white, male violence\u2014indeed, whiteness itself\u2014as a structural weapon that must be destroyed, because strengthening reckless, flimsy gun laws alone won\u2019t save black children.\n\nIf a brutal history that is not yet past has taught us anything, let it be that.", "keywords": ["know", "lives", "schools", "arent", "white", "students", "walk", "black", "children", "safe", "violence", "safety"], "polarity": 0.0789193702676849, "subjectivity": 0.34247636882468346},

He also bashed the armed officer who didn\u2019t rush into the building to confront the shooter when he heard the shots. He called the officer\u2019s actions \u201cfrankly disgusting\u201d and criticized several deputies who failed to immediately enter the school, telling the governors that the law enforcement officers \u201cweren\u2019t exactly Medal of Honor winners.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow dare Trump criticize the police officer who didn\u2019t run into the school to take down the shooter!

In an interview with Billboard to promote Ventriloquism, an album of covers, the singer-songwriter and musician made clear that she wasn\u2019t impressed with Mars\u2019 performance of the \u201cFinesse\u201d remix featuring Cardi B. No, she read him with the sort of blunt, matter-of-fact assessment you\u2019d expect from a black woman at 49 (or any age, arguably, though hell hath no fury like a seasoned black queen). Per Billboard:\n\n\n\nWhat did you think of Bruno that night at the Grammys? What he\u2019s doing is karaoke, basically. With \u201cFinesse,\u201d in particular, I think he was simply copying Bell Biv DeVoe. I think he was copying Babyface. And definitely there were some elements of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis back when they worked with Human League. I feel like there\u2019s just all these threads running through there, but not in a genuine way. How fine is that balance between karaoke and artistic interpretation? It\u2019s really a matter of musicality and being able to manipulate the tropes in a way that makes it feel personal. It can\u2019t just be a pastiche, where you\u2019re copying or mimicking an old sound or just doing karaoke. There has to be a form of sincerity.\n\nI\u2019ve always appreciated Meshell Ndegeocello for sounding naturally chopped and screwed, but now I can add her ability to dismantle a target with surgical precision to the list. Ndegeocello is not the first person to call out Bruno Mars for \u201ccopying\u201d other artists. Years ago, multiple critics noted that Mars\u2019 hit \u201cLocked Out of Heaven\u201d sounded exactly like a Police song.\n\nBack then, Bruno Mars responded to the claims with the following admission:\n\n\u201cHell yeah! You try to write a Police song!\u201d he laughed. \u201cI grew up listening to the Police, I grew up performing in bars, singing Police songs. ... I remember performing a song like \u2018Roxanne,\u2019 and you play those first couple of chords, and you hit that first note, and you watch the whole bar ignite. And as an artist, as a songwriter, it\u2019s like \u2018Man, I want to write a song that makes people\u2019s eyes explode the first chord!\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd when \u201cUptown Funk\u201d essentially took over all of our lives for a period in time, many astutely noted, \u201cThat motherfucker just remade \u2018Jungle Love!\u2019\u201d Others also pointed to the Gap Band\u2019s \u201cOops Upside Your Head.\u201d There is no record of Morris Day slapping Bruno Mars in retaliation, but Charlie, last name Wilson, and the rest of the Gap Band did smack Bruno and company with a suit\u2014which led to them receiving songwriting credits on the megahit.\n\n\n\nMore recently, even I couldn\u2019t help but call out the Zapp & Roger influences of \u201c24K Magic.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHaving said that, while I do think Ndegeocello is correct in pointing out the type of artists and producers who influence Bruno Mars\u2019 most recent hits, I don\u2019t question his sincerity about the kind of product he churns out just because much of it sounds so familiar to tracks of yore.\n\nAs a child, Puerto Rican Frankie Lymon grew up performing at dinner theaters, and that very much informs the sort of artist and entertainer he is. That\u2019s why I was tickled when he served as wedding singer for Spotify CEO Daniel Ek\u2019s wedding to Sofia Levander in 2016 because it felt like a return to form. Bruno Mars is more or less the most successful wedding singer ever, or, at the very least, the most successful wedding singer of the modern era.\n\n\n\nAnd when it comes to his music, Mars has long been up front not only in his intent when making music but also in praising those who have molded and shaped it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast year, in a Latina magazine interview, Mars said the following:\n\n\n\nWhen you say \u201cBlack music,\u201d understand that you are talking about rock, jazz, R&B, reggae, funk, doo-wop, hip-hop and Motown. Black people created it all. Being Puerto Rican, even salsa music stems back to the Motherland [Africa]. So, in my world, Black music means everything. It\u2019s what gives America its swag.\n\nSo he acknowledges his intentions, praises those who have helped shaped his sound and, when met with legal challenges, will pay up and move on. As far as pop stars go, that\u2019s most of what you can ask for of them. Beyond that, though, I question whether or not the kind of artist Bruno Mars is and has aimed to be calls for the kind of musicality and \u201coriginality\u201d Ndegeocello is calling him out for (while promoting a covers album, no less).\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen reading her interview, it reminded me of the first time I saw Bruno Mars perform as an opening act for Janelle Mon\u00e1e (this is before the two would later tour under his banner in 2011). These two have always been similar to me in that they\u2019re amazing entertainers who have music that registers as intentionally nostalgic. Mon\u00e1e is forward-thinking in terms of her imagery and messaging, but when I\u2019m listening to her actual music, it\u2019s a lot like Bruno\u2019s in that it often makes me think of past works. That\u2019s not a jab; I\u2019m a fan of both. Not every artist is trying to reinvent the wheel.\n\n\n\nThere are certainly other critiques to be made about this. Say, why is Bruno Mars winning all of the major awards at the Grammys when the likes of Beyonc\u00e9 are robbed of their honors in these categories or Rihanna is totally snubbed altogether by being left out? Likewise, one has valid reasons to ask why Bruno Mars can be awarded for everything when the black artists who inspired him have not been as fortunate (Mariah Carey has ended the Grammys, though).\n\nStill, Bruno Mars\u2019 main goal is to entertain, and he\u2019s really good at it. So I\u2019m gonna keep bopping to the \u201cFinesse (remix).\u201d I\u2019ll continue singing to \u201cThat\u2019s What I Like\u201d as if puberty hadn\u2019t already snatched my R&B thot-throb dreams away. I will not slow down my two-stepping to \u201cChunky.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, you may one day catch me out here dancing to Bruno Mars with Anita Baker, who clearly approves of Bruno.\n\n", "keywords": ["mars", "bopping", "think", "meshell", "right", "artist", "music", "im", "ndegeocello", "thats", "bruno", "black", "wedding", "copying", "karaoke"], "polarity": 0.20269038701622968, "subjectivity": 0.43278312823256637},

Her imaginary colors include \u201cIf You\u2019re White, It\u2019s a Mental Illness, and If You\u2019re Brown, You\u2019re a Terrorist,\u201d \u201cBulletproof Black\u201d (to match the vests we\u2019re going to have to start putting on our children), \u201cMoney\u201d (because that\u2019s all our country cares about) and \u201cThe Blood of Our Children\u201d (because it\u2019s what we\u2019re bathing in these days), which she pantomimes applying to her face.\n\nOur personal favorite? The blush: \u201cSo we look flushed with embarrassment, like the rest of our country.\u201d\n\nThe point? That thoughts and prayers are nothing without action to prevent this kind of tragedy from happening again. But in case you thought Sailor J was just here for the hits, she also links to the GoFundMe page of the Stoneman Douglas Victims\u2019 Fund, which so far has raised over $2 million of its $2.5 million goal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s not much to laugh about regarding this recent act of domestic terrorism in Florida\u2014or the countless preceding acts of police brutality, gun fatalities or or lax gun control in this country. But if there\u2019s one thing we know for sure, it\u2019s that \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d aren\u2019t the solution.

It was an adorable gimmick, and enough to raise the question: Is Cross Colours due for a comeback?\n\nLaunched in 1989 by Carl Jones and T.J. Walker, the black-owned urban-streetwear label marketed itself as \u201cclothing without prejudice\u201d and was a perfect fit for the era of new jack swing, a Fresh Prince and \u201chappy\u201d hip-hop\u2014not to mention how well the clothing coordinated with our African medallions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDistinguished by boxy silhouettes\u2014worn intentionally even more oversized, of course\u2014Cross Colours\u2019 trademark bright-hued schemes were initially inspired by a swatch of kente cloth, as Walker told Bobby Kim\u2019s The Hundreds magazine in 2014:\n\nIt elevated into a lifestyle, a collection, a look, a style. It morphed. ... For us, the colors were not only for the people, but for the fabric, for the thread, for the united force of people. Gang violence was also very prevalent at that time. So then we said Cross Colours for all that too \u2013 to unite the colors of the gangs.\n\nThe brand was a hit, dominating the early-\u201990s urban-fashion landscape, and seen on everyone from Muhammad Ali to Paula Abdul. And then, just as quickly as it peaked, it fell, due in large part to its affiliation with Merry-Go-Round\u2014one of the era\u2019s premier fast-fashion retailers\u2014which declared bankruptcy and defaulted upon millions of dollars in orders from Cross Colours in the process.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe downward spiral would continue as trademarks changed hands; eventually leading the brand to become dormant for the next two decades.\n\nBut if Cross Colours\u2019 appearance on the Grammy stage came as a surprise to most, it\u2019s only because Walker and Jones have taken a tactical approach to quietly rebuilding their brand, beginning to harness the power of social media several years ago to gauge the interest of, and access to, a new generation, as they told Kim in 2014:\n\nWe\u2019re trying to sort out how we really want to present ourselves. ... Is it all vintage? Do we have better pricing? Higher pricing? So we\u2019re going through that \u2013 the motions right now. And what do we really mean to the consumer today? It\u2019s a younger, different generation. Do they know our brand? So we start with a little bit of Instagram and now we have 5,000 followers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat following is now over 25,000\u2014and rising since Sunday night. [Editor\u2019s note: As of press time, we are still awaiting comment from Cross Colours.]\n\nBut while Bruno Mars and Co. rocked the classic baseball jerseys and bucket hats that Gen X instantly waxed nostalgic over, a visit to the Cross Colours site offers a refreshing update on the aesthetic, in addition to \u201cretro reissues\u201d\u2014where there was not an orange jersey in sight. Military-inspired looks and message T-shirts are in abundance, as well as a surprisingly sexy underwear line perfectly made for peeking out of the waistband of your saggy jeans.\n\nAnd while we\u2019re not sure we\u2019re ready to rock rainbow stripes again (sorry, Cardi), we have to admit that just seeing the brand back in action takes us back to a happier time and place.

The nationwide demonstration is being hailed as a groundbreaking act of civil disobedience that seeks to protect the lives of America\u2019s most vulnerable citizens. There is no way anyone could object to something so necessary and relevant.\n\nUnless, of course, black people do it.\n\nThe National School Walkout is a 17-minute planned act of defiance, protest and solidarity meant to spark action and commemorate the lives of 17 students gunned down at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet there be no misunderstanding: Nikolas Cruz is a mass murderer, and the massacre in Parkland was a tragedy. Hopefully this walkout will prompt our elected officials to take a long look at the nation\u2019s gun laws because those students deserve better. Their lives are valuable.\n\nBut not more valuable.\n\nThe game-changing, totally unique idea of the National School Walkout that is gathering attention all around the world is a tactic that has been tried before, to much derision. The people who sought to inspire meaningful change and spark conversation were called disruptive and communists and even castigated as terrorists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen white people started doing it.\n\nIn February 2016, students at Mount Hebron High School in Ellicott City, Md., left campus to highlight racism at their school, to responses like: \u201cStart a conversation? How\u2019s this for an opening line? Stop being professional victims and get your selves back into the school.\u201d\n\nIn Madison, Wis., cops arrested and maced students who walked out of school in protest of the 2015 police killing of Tony Robinson.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, there are some who will say that this has nothing to do with race. The shooting in Parkland is a national story, and that is why people are paying attention to those kids. It\u2019s not because they are white. The stories I just pointed out are lesser-known incidents, proving that people don\u2019t care about the color of the students advocating for change, or even the skin tone of the victims. This is about all lives!\n\nThey are correct.\n\nBut I might be wrong. This may simply be a case of imbalanced media focus. Who\u2019s to say that the Parkland students are receiving more media attention for the walkout because the victims and the activists are mostly white?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is no one in America who doesn\u2019t know about the tragic deaths of those high school students. It is a big, talked-about national news incident. Maybe they are garnering attention and inspiring legislative change simply because they are young and conscious.\n\nOf course, that wouldn\u2019t explain why\u2014unlike with the recently passed gun legislation in Florida\u2014no one bothered to examine the \u201cStand your ground\u201d law after high schoolers all over Florida walked out in protest of Trayvon Martin\u2019s death, which was arguably more widely known. What about the students who walked out in protest of the Mike Brown nonverdict in St. Louis County? That was definitely a bigger story than Parkland.\n\nPerhaps I\u2019m ranting about nothing. You know me, always bringing up race. Or maybe I am cherry-picking isolated incidents. Maybe black kids protesting by walking out of schools was never really a thing and I\u2019m making up stories like these:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can be sure that some anally injured, weak-skinned troll will seek to dismiss this article by posing the ancient Caucasian riddle: \u201cBut what about black-on-black violence? (Which, according to my research, is different from \u201cbutt-hurt.\u201d Anal injuries are real.)\n\nBut anyone in a black community knows that stop-the-violence rallies greatly outnumber Black Lives Matter protests. However, the media refuses to cover those marches with the same rabid fervor. Why the hell would white people even hear about the Chicago elementary school kids who marched against gun violence in their communities in 2017? Or the black and Hispanic high school students in Los Angeles who walked out to protest gang and gun violence? Do they even know about the kids in Sandy Spring, Ga., who held a sit-in at school to protest gun violence? How about the kids at Chicago\u2019s Polaris Academy who organized a \u201cplay outside\u201d day in protest of gang and gun violence almost a year ago?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 17 lives ended in the halls of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High shouldn\u2019t matter any more than the countless ones snuffed out by the drug war, police brutality and\u2014yes, I\u2019ll say it this time\u2014black-on-black crime. You don\u2019t think black kids want to feel safe, too? Contrary to the belief of police officers and \u201cAll Lives Matter\u201d activists, black bodies are not bulletproof.\n\nThis criticism in no way disparages the actions of students across the country protesting gun laws. Ultimately, everyone hopes that the National Student Walkout inspires necessary change. Yet this is simply the latest example of the national double standard placed on the shoulders of black people.\n\nAfter all, black resistance is like rap music; Bo Derek braids cornrows; moving to a Brooklyn, N.Y., neighborhood; and relocating to this great, big land called America: No one ever gives a fuck about it ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUntil white people start doing it.", "keywords": ["school", "lives", "lets", "walkout", "high", "national", "kids", "protest", "happens", "students", "forget", "walk", "black", "save", "gun"], "polarity": 0.0754330065359477, "subjectivity": 0.4435912698412699},

Rick Scott speaks to the media as he visits Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School after a shooting at the school killed 17 people on Feb. 14, 2018, in Parkland, Fla. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\nThe student-led push to finally bring a semblance of gun control appears to be working in Florida. Gov. Rick Scott and other state lawmakers on Friday offered a series of proposals that would mark \u201cthe most significant move toward gun control in Florida in decades.\u201d\n\nThe proposed gun laws defy the National Rifle Association and President Donald Trump, who have suggested arming educators as a way to fight the epidemic of school shootings, the New York Times reports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to NBC News, Scott explicitly said that he disagrees with arming school teachers.\n\n\u201cMy focus is on bringing in law enforcement,\u201d Scott said. \u201cI think you need to have individuals who are trained, well trained.\u201d\n\nScott\u2019s plan includes the following:\n\nRaising the minimum age to buy any firearm from 18 to 21 (currently, 18-year-olds can purchase semi-automatic rifles but not handguns);\n\nOutlawing bump stocks, a kind of modification that allows gun users to fire their weapons faster;\n\nRequiring more safety and mental health training for school personnel;\n\nEstablishing improved processes for authorities to share information about potential at-risk students and security threats;\n\nIncreasing law enforcement presence in schools;\n\nMaking it more difficult for individuals with mental health issues to access weapons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Times reports that other Florida lawmakers have proposed creating a \u201cmarshal\u201d program that would let teachers who have enough hours of training with law enforcement to carry a weapon on campus.\n\nThe proposals do stop short of the sort of gun reform that student-activists have been pleading for, which includes a ban on the AR-15 semi-automatic rifle.\n\n\u201cBanning specific weapons is not going to fix this,\u201d said Scott, a man who proposed banning a specific modification because he believed that would \u201cfix\u201d things.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome of the proposals put forward by the governor are concerning for other reasons.\n\nAs many mental health advocates have noted, most gun violence is not attributable to mental illness. \u201cMental health professionals welcome more resources and attention,\u201d as noted in a recent PBS article, \u201cbut they say the administration is ignoring the real problem\u201d\u2014that of easy access to guns.\n\nAmerican Medical Association President David Barbe also emphasized this in his interview with PBS, saying that improved access to mental health care was important, but \u201cto blame this all just on mental illness is not sufficient.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe proposed laws also place a heavy emphasis on putting more law enforcement inside schools. Gov. Scott requested $500 million to implement mental health and school-safety programs and to ensure that each Florida public school had at least one armed officer for every 1,000 students.\n\nBut the recent example of the Florida deputy who failed to respond to the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School should reveal the limitations of this plan. In addition, the disproportionate policing and punishment of students of color by school police means that Florida schools could actually become more dangerous places for black students.\n\nSo what sorts of gun reform should be on the table?\n\nWhile the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been barred from researching gun violence since the mid-1990s, there is some data suggesting that certain policies are more effective than others. According to Scientific American, these include:\n\nrequiring a permit to purchase a firearm that must be applied for, in person, at a local law enforcement agency\n\nbanning individuals convicted of any violent crime from gun purchase\n\nmaking all domestic violence offenders surrender their guns\n\ntemporarily banning active alcohol abusers from owning firearms\n\nAs for an assault weapons ban, the New York Times writes that Florida Senate Democrats have promised to amend any GOP gun bill with the addition of an assault weapon ban, but since they\u2019re outnumbered in both chambers of the state Legislature, those measures would be unlikely to pass.", "keywords": ["school", "shouldnt", "trump", "health", "florida", "scott", "yes", "celebrate", "ranks", "proposed", "rick", "nra", "law", "weapons", "enforcement", "gov", "mental", "gun"], "polarity": 0.06170078509061563, "subjectivity": 0.4295568273534376},

You probably recognize that combination of words and syllables from Black Moon\u2019s 1993 song \u201cWho Got da Props?\u201d off of their Enta da Stage album. But they asked a very important question, and the answer to that question is undoubtedly Belcalis Almanzar, better known to the world as Cardi B.\n\nI\u2019ve been racking my brain trying to think of who could possibly have had a better 2017 than she. Hell, her 2018 is even going well. She managed to get on the stage at the Grammys and perform with Bruno Mars\u2014the night\u2019s big winner\u2014and then end up in a freakin\u2019 Super Bowl commercial for Amazon.com\u2019s Alexa.\n\nLove her or hate her\u2014and I honestly don\u2019t know how you can hate her\u2014her glow up is real, happening on her own terms, and ultimately, she seems to be truly enjoying it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsider this: She\u2019s managed to be the first woman\u2014not Beyonc\u00e9, Nicki Minaj, Lauryn Hill, Alicia Keys\u2014to have five songs simultaneously featured in the top 10 on Billboard\u2019s Hot R&B/Hip-Hop chart. She had the indisputable song of 2017 in \u201cBodak Yellow,\u201d reaching No. 1 on the pop charts. While Nicki had a much better verse on Migos\u2019 \u201cMotorSport,\u201d half of the times I\u2019ve heard the song, the DJ cut it off after Cardi\u2019s verse. That makes NO sense, but also, I get it. This is the world we live in. Cardi B hopped on Bruno Mars\u2019 song \u201cFinesse\u201d and with the awesome video became even more endearing. I don\u2019t even know how that\u2019s possible.\n\nConsidering where most of us first saw her, I\u2019m not even sure there\u2019s a word to describe her ascent. Like most folks, I first saw her on Love & Hip Hop through DJ Self as he was trying to work with her and not work with her at the same time. She was the hotheaded Dominican from the South Bronx, N.Y., with \u201cthe teeth\u201d\u2014she got a bag and fixed those\u2014who was dating the dude in prison. She couldn\u2019t quite get anybody to check out her music in a real way.\n\nNow? She lives on the charts, performs at the Grammys, is engaged to a Migo(s), is in Super Bowl commercials and gives hilarious interviews on red carpets. Of her appearance at the Grammys, she managed to say that she had butterflies in both her stomach and her vagina, and I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s the new standard now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can understand the hesitation on the part of hip-hoppers to heap too much praise on her. She is, after all, a rapper. And I\u2019m not sure anybody would be rushing to crown her the queen of rap, especially when Nicki Minaj and Remy Ma are out there. They\u2019re rappers. Cardi B is more of a personality who decided to do like so many others: use music as her vehicle to doing something other than starving. They\u2019re not really in it for the craft; they\u2019re in it for the money.\n\nBecause I\u2019m a hip-hop head who will fight anybody over the \u201990s, I get the difficulty in being happy about this. BUT I\u2019m also a person who believes that anybody with limitations who maximizes on their opportunities and doesn\u2019t burn down the industry along the way isn\u2019t ruining the culture. She\u2019s not Vanilla Ice or Snow. Or Bo$$, who famously faked her entire life and upbringing to become a gangsta rapper. She\u2019s the real MC Gusto from CB4.\n\nCardi has both put herself and been put in positions where she could make the most of them or fumble, and thus far, she\u2019s kicked asses and taken names. By being what I can only presume is authentically her and releasing music that absolutely beats, she\u2019s gained fans and people who aren\u2019t fans but are running out of reasons to hate her. She\u2019s winning; why hate on somebody who is winning with a smile by being her best self, flaws and all?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Facebook, I saw a friend of mine point out that Cardi B should probably have been considered for best new artist at the Grammys. And that\u2019s absolutely true. The way the Grammys are set up, I\u2019m guessing she\u2019ll be up for that award in 2022. But no other artist in the past six months has gone from \u201cWe think we heard of her\u201d to being a damn-near household name like she has. People genuinely like her, and you can\u2019t force personal gravity.\n\nEarly on, I was on the struggle-to-find-the-reason-we-should-care-about-Cardi bandwagon, but somewhere along the way, I had to acknowledge that I kept saying I didn\u2019t like her but knew all the words to \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d and enjoyed her random, sometimes entirely nonsensical Instagram musings and even follow her on IG, and wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt when she got problematic.\n\nAt some point, you just have to give people their credit for doing things their way and managing to be super successful at them. That is Cardi. Do I think she\u2019ll be around for the next 10 years as an artist of note? I honestly have no idea. Maybe there\u2019s an artist in there trying to get out that will surprise us all. Or maybe not. Maybe we\u2019ve seen what she has to offer, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll keep getting until we all collectively don\u2019t want it anymore.

The incident occurred during a course about gun safety.\n\nAccording to KSBW-TV, Dennis Alexander was leading the Administration of Justice class at Seaside High School when his firearm went off at about 1:20 p.m. Alexander was pointing the weapon to the ceiling when it went off, causing pieces of the ceiling to fall to the floor.\n\nThe Seaside Police Department confirmed that while no one suffered \u201cserious injuries,\u201d one 17-year-old boy suffered \u201cmoderate\u201d injuries after fragments from the bullet ricocheted off the ceiling and hit his neck.\n\nAlexander had, in fact, told the class that he wanted to make sure the gun wasn\u2019t loaded when it went off, Fermin Gonzales, the father of the injured teen, told the news station.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the craziest thing. It could have been very bad,\u201d Gonzales said.\n\nWhat was really crazy was that after the gun went off, Alexander apparently apologized and went on doing what he was doing. No one at the school, according to Gonzales, checked to make sure that everyone was OK. So you can imagine how shocked the Gonzales family was when the teen returned home with blood on his shirt and bullet fragments in his neck. His parents had to rush him to the hospital to be examined.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s shaken up, but he\u2019s going to be OK,\u201d Gonzales told KSBW. \u201cI\u2019m just pretty upset that no one told us anything and we had to call the police ourselves to report it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlexander was placed on administrative leave from his teaching position at the high school as well as with the Sand City, Calif., Police Department.\n\n\u201cI have concerns about why he was displaying a loaded firearm in a classroom.

From Blue Ivy letting us know she runs the Knowles-Carter household, to everyone with white roses in support of Time\u2019s Up, Kendrick Lamar\u2019s American satire and Kesha\u2019s powerful Time\u2019s Up-esque performance (featuring Cyndi Lauper, Camila Cabello, Andra Day and more), taking a stand has become an important thread in the makeup of an artist. \u201cWe come in peace, but we mean business,\u201d said Janelle Mon\u00e1e, carrying the torch for equality for women with her Grammys appearance.\n\nMon\u00e1e shook the table with her speech:\n\nTonight, I am proud to stand in solidarity as not just an artist, but a young woman, with my fellow sisters in this room who make up the music industry\u2014artists, writers, assistants, publicists, CEOs, producers, engineers and women from all sectors of the business. We are also daughters, wives, mothers, sisters and human beings. To those who would dare try and silence us, we offer you two words: #TimesUp. We say time\u2019s up for pay inequality, discrimination or harassment of any kind, and the abuse of power.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGrammy nominees Logic and Khalid, alongside Grammy winner Alessia Cara, performed their powerful nominated song, \u201c1-800-273-8255.\u201d The song, about suicide, was a shift not only in the culture but also in the room, with the performers bringing a group of suicide survivors and family members of suicide victims onstage with them. Logic ended the performance with a stance on immigration policy, saying, \u201cBring us your tired, your poor and any immigrant who seeks refuge.\u201d\n\nTo say there were important moments at the Grammys this year is to make an understatement. Check out some of the best moments from the 2018 Grammys:\n\n\n\nKendrick Opens\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 2018 Grammys opened in a big way with Kendrick Lamar giving us a powerful political performance complete with American flags and marching soldiers. With tears in his eyes, Lamar rapped a mile a minute to songs like \u201cXXX,\u201d \u201cDNA\u201d and \u201cKing\u2019s Dead,\u201d marching alongside the soldiers and introducing us to his satire. The screens behind him read, \u201cThis is a satire by Kendrick Lamar.\u201d Men in red hoodies fell to the ground every time Lamar extended his arm to shoot them.\n\n\n\nAs if that wasn\u2019t entertaining enough, Lamar brought out U2\u2019s Bono and the Edge and Dave Chappelle! Chappelle reminded the audience, \u201cThe only thing more frightening than watching a black man be honest in America is being a an honest black man in America.\u201d Message! Then out came a black female drummer, not only giving you African realness, but sis danced, too! Lamar better give us Motherland! \u201cIs this on cable?\u201d Chappelle asked, because Lamar was out here giving the world the realness.\n\n\n\nBy the time Lamar went onstage, he was already the winner of three Grammys. He won for best rap performance, best rap album and best music video for \u201cHumble.\u201d He and Rihanna also won best rap/sung performance for \u201cLoyalty.\u201d I\u2019m like congrats to Lamar and all, but Rihanna in that monochromatic vinyl moment was worth fawning over.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOh, and I couldn\u2019t get enough of Rihanna busting out the South African dance the gwara gwara!\n\n\n\nThe All-Black Church Choir During Sam Smith\u2019s Performance\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSam Smith was accompanied by a black church choir that stood behind him giving nothing but strong black women who were all fresh out the salon. Sam sang down on his single \u201cPray\u201d as the choir served us Baptist church.\n\nChuck Berry and Fats Domino Tribute\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJon Batiste and Gary Clark Jr. laced the stage with more rock \u2019n\u2019 roll than the Grammys deserved with their Chuck Berry and Fats Domino tribute. Late Show bandleader Batiste\u2019s laid-back style was a perfect complement to Clark\u2019s funky style. From Domino\u2019s \u201cAin\u2019t That a Shame\u201d to Berry\u2019s \u201cMaybelline,\u201d the performance reminded us all of Berry\u2019s and Domino\u2019s undeniable contributions to music.\n\n\n\nBlue Ivy Shushing Mommy and Daddy\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYeah, these front-row seats to the Grammys are great and all, but chill, Mom and Dad, you\u2019re embarrassing me.\u201d We all go through that phase where our parents are less superhero and more super annoying. I wonder what that\u2019s going to look like for Blue Ivy because she clearly runs the entire compound of the Knowles-Carters.\n\n\n\nChildish Gambino Performance\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI felt like I was in the middle of a \u201990s sex scene in a classic black movie. Donald Glover sang \u201cTerrified\u201d and the vibes of the entire show changed. There are moments during many shows when singers bring out their backup singers to riff together. One of the most iconic was when Mariah Carey brought out Trey Lorenz during a performance of \u201cI\u2019ll Be There,\u201d and going forward, everyone wanted to hear that version of the song. Glover brought out child actor J.D. McCrary (who is featured on the song), and he is easily a vocal genius.\n\n\n\nGlover was quietly impressive. He\u2019s well on his way to EGOT territory, as he\u2019s already holding two Emmys and a Grammy. An Oscar and a Tony aren\u2019t far-fetched.\n\n\n\nDave Chappelle Shades Whole Show Over Tribe Called Quest Snub\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDave Chappelle was asked to present the award for the best rap album, and he did so, in a very Chappelle way. He gave several shoutouts, including one to A Tribe Called Quest, calling them all out by name, then making a reference to the group\u2019s 2016 album, We Got It from Here ... Thank You 4 Your Service.\n\n\u201cI have so much love and respect to all the nominees tonight,\u201d Chappelle began, \u201cand I just want to take a moment to honor Jarobi, Ali Shaheed Muhammad, Q-Tip, sometimes Busta, sometimes Consequence and, of course, always and forever Phife Dawg. Can we kick it?\u201d\n\nAnd then Kendrick Lamar won the Grammy, giving him his fifth win for the night! \u201cGod up top all the time,\u201d Lamar said. \u201cI thought it was about the accolades, the cars and clothes, but it\u2019s really about expressing yourself and putting that paint on the canvas for the world to evolve for the next generation and the next.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUgh, Kendrick Lamar for president!\n\n(Sidenote: When Dave Chappelle won the Grammy for best comedy album, mostly what he had to say in his acceptance speech was, \u201cSee you Monday.\u201d)\n\n\n\nCardi B and Bruno Mars Drippin\u2019 in \u2018Finesse\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s hard to watch Cardi B without being excited thinking of her meteoric rise and smiling. I\u2019m just so proud of her, out here getting nominated and performing at her first Grammys! Being nominated up against Jay-Z and Kendrick Lamar is crazy and, yes, \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d still slaps.\n\nIt was great seeing Grammy god Bruno Mars and Cardi kill their In Living Color tribute of a performance on the Grammys stage. Bruno\u2019s dance break hyped the crowd up with the best \u201990s moves you\u2019ve seen since House Party.\n\nShaggy Kept Coming Out With Sting\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSting wants us to know that he\u2019s all about the islands with his new collaboration with Shaggy. From their subway skit (that went on way too long) with the show\u2019s host, James Corden, to their performance, I felt force-fed, but I am honestly curious about this odd couple.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s evidently a joint album coming, and they sang \u201cDon\u2019t Make Me Wait,\u201d which actually does slap. I\u2019m low-key excited for this unlikely pairing. I might be lying.\n\n\n\nShemar Moore and Eve Introducing SZA\u2019s Performance\n\nWhat\u2019s black as hell? Having actor and picture-of-perfection Shemar Moore and rapper and host Eve introducing SZA to the stage for her first Grammys performance. And SZA went off!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd my feelings are a little bit hurt that SZA was the most nominated woman at the Grammys this year and left with nothing. I\u2019m glad she didn\u2019t win for best new artist. We all know that curse.\n\n\n\nFire and Fury Spoken-Word Auditions\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of host James Corden\u2019s skits consisted of various celebrities with not-so-positive opinions on your president sitting down to do dramatic readings of the book Fire and Fury. The lineup was perfect: John Legend, Snoop Dogg, Cher, Cardi B and Hillary Clinton. The skit was glorious.\n\nAnd an honorable mention goes to Cardi B\u2019s red-carpet moment with E! host Giuliana Rancic. When she asked Cardi how she was feeling, Cardi cardi-ed and said: \u201cI\u2019m feeling good. I\u2019m feeling nervous, overwhelmed, everything. Butterflies in my stomach and vagina.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was clear Rancic couldn\u2019t remember the Cardi B lyrics she desperately wanted to summon; nor could she handle Cardi (or Lil Uzi Vert, for that matter), but Cardi handled her own and made for another hilarious, viral moment.\n\n\n\nDid you watch the 2018 Grammys?

And it is not lost on me that when given a choice between the two, the Recording Academy loves to reward music that sounds black without rewarding actual black people.\n\nIn fact, since 2008, only one black person has won best album at this award show, and I would argue that Herbie Hancock won because he was paying homage to a beloved, soulful white woman. In the past 10 years, more often than not, black artists were shafted by the academy and forced to watch someone with an inferior, less important album take the award that was rightfully theirs.

Gone were his witty lyrics and catchy, soulful beats. Instead, he used the medium of Auto-Tune to express his pain while using the androidlike sound to hide emotions a black man, much less a rapper, was not allowed to feel.

It was not the first \u201csurprise album,\u201d but it was the one that set industry standards about how to release in the streaming era. Why this lost to Beck is beyond me.

But I no longer believe these things are true ...\n\n\n\nI know they are.\n\n\n\nLast night, while sitting on the couch engaged in a time-honored Friday-night Negro tradition called \u201cchillin\u2019,\u201d I received a text that simply read, \u201cDid you hear about Junie Poonie and that mass shooter?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy heart sank.\n\nI contacted Junie\u2019s sister first, and she sent me the link to the story of how her brother stopped a man who wanted to become the \u201cgreatest mass shooter in history\u201d by filming himself massacring people in a Las Vegas church.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo understand this story, you must first know the hierarchy of the black family tree. There are black people across this country who have blood relatives they don\u2019t know about, including sisters, brothers and sometimes parents. Ranking higher than any DNA-based relationship, though, is the earned honorific of \u201cplay cousin.\u201d A play cousin is a de facto sibling. It is more family member than actual family.\n\nWhen I was growing up, my mother\u2019s best friend had four children. She was as much my aunt as any of my mother\u2019s sisters. Her husband was one of the scant few in-house fathers in my neighborhood, and he was a hulking figure of a man who still calls me \u201cprofessor.\u201d Like my family, they had three girls, and only one of their children was a boy. His name was Heyward Jackson Jr., but in most black neighborhoods, birth names are as malleable as DNA and often give way to nicknames.\n\nWe call him \u201cJunie Poonie.\u201d\n\nAccording to KVVU-TV, on Feb. 21, Heyward Jackon Jr. was attending a church service at his Las Vegas church when he noticed 23-year-old Calin Howard Hodges asleep on a pew. Junie asked Hodges if he needed some help because he looked disheveled. Hodges declined Heyward\u2019s help and told Junie that he was \u201cplanning something big.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJunie began talking to Hodges (and I know Junie; he can charm a space alien from Nebula 5 who only speaks Quooloc into an engaging conversation by making a person think he genuinely cares about their home galaxy and is interested in what they have to say). Hodges began telling Heyward that he was planning to become \u201cthe greatest mass shooter in history,\u201d referenced Stephen Paddock, and, according to the police report, added that he \u201ccompletely identifies with every mass shooter\u201d and \u201csalutes every person who has the balls to do it.\u201d\n\nAnd what did Junie do? He kept talking to the dude and surreptitiously began recording the conversation on his cellphone. About 40 members of the church were shuffled outside and the police were called while Junie kept the man engaged.\n\nWhen the cops arrived, Junie shared his recordings with the officers and they arrested Hodges. \u201cPolice charged Hodges with making threats or conveying false information concerning acts of terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, lethal agents or toxins prohibited,\u201d KVVU-TV reports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolice will not say if Hodges was armed. According to the Las Vegas Review-Journal, he was an adult film actor who had been fired as a Lyft driver.\n\n\n\nNevada has some of the weakest gun laws in the country. Newsweek describes them this way:\n\nNevada law does not require firearms owners to have licenses or register their weapons, nor does it limit the number of firearms an individual posses. Automatic assault weapons and machine guns are also legal in the state as long as they are registered and possessed in adherence to federal law, according to the National Rifle Association.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf this incident seems like someone just rambling to a stranger, when police searched Hodges\u2019 car, they found a diary saying, \u201cStephen Paddock stole my idea on 1 October.\u201d \u201c1 October\u201d is a reference to the day Stephen Paddock killed 58 people at a country music concert in Las Vegas.\n\nCalin Hodges\u2019 planned mass execution was also reminiscent of Dylann Roof, who shot up Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C.\u2014the state where Junie and I grew up\u2014killing nine parishioners during a Wednesday-night Bible study.\n\nHeyward thwarted Hodges\u2019 copycat crime on Feb. 21\u2014at Mountain Top Faith Ministries\u2019 Wednesday-night Bible study.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJunie and I grew up like brothers along with another one of our friends, James Bond (no, that\u2019s not a nickname; James\u2019 nickname is 007, or \u201cDouble-O\u201d), who lived on the same street. The three of us were the rare few guys in our entire neighborhood to escape our surroundings and go to college. I somehow managed to get an academic scholarship. Double-O went into the Army and then to college. Junie attended college on a football scholarship and later moved to Las Vegas to play semipro football.\n\n\n\nThey were the cool guys. I was the nerd. They were both charismatic and athletic. I was the nerd. Our families attended the same church. We teased each other\u2019s sisters. We ate at each other\u2019s table. Junie was younger than us, but he was never afraid of shit, maybe because he was crazy. Or maybe because he\u2019s been built like a brick shithouse since he was about 8.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur only disagreement in life was when Junie informed me and Double-O that he was pledging Kappa. I\u2019m still disappointed in him for that. But he\u2019s still my play cousin. Plus, I\u2019ve never seen Junie shimmy.\n\nWhen I spoke to Junie, he told me he was definitely \u201cshook,\u201d but told me he couldn\u2019t reveal the details publicly because prosecutors had issued a gag order on the case. He also said that he thinks people need to hear the audio recordings so the public can know the kinds of people who have access to guns.\n\nWe rarely talk much these days, and to be honest, it\u2019s my fault. Whenever we have a conversation, it\u2019s because he occasionally reaches out to me to talk about something random. He now lives in Vegas and I live in Alabama, so we don\u2019t even get to see each other\u2019s families.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the last few years, we have seen each other a couple of times. His nephew was in a car accident a few miles from my home last year, and I made sure Junie\u2019s sister, mother and father were well-fed when they were in town. He called me when he was getting married, and we got the chance to hang out last summer. We were both in town on business, so we didn\u2019t spend a long time together.\n\nThe FBI reports that of the 104 active-shooter events between 2000 and 2012, 17 were stopped by potential victims. In 14 of those situations, the shooting was stopped by someone who was unarmed and managed to talk to the person or subdue the shooter with no weapon.\n\nOnly three active shooters were stopped by a good guy with a gun.\n\nI know Heyward Jackson Jr. and cannot imagine him being erased from the earth by a psychopath. Even worse, I can\u2019t fathom that someone would become a celebrity by killing my play cousin and lifelong friend. He is a father. He is a husband.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJunie Poonie is a good guy.\n\nHe did not have a gun.", "keywords": ["guys", "know", "shooter", "good", "las", "church", "disproved", "stopped", "myth", "guns", "cousin", "shooting", "play", "vegas", "junie", "hodges", "mass"], "polarity": 0.0872320768662232, "subjectivity": 0.46316298877274487},

They just prefer that you make up a bunch of wild-ass garbage about those tragedies.\n\n\n\nSurvivors of last week\u2019s school shooting in Parkland, Fla., one of the deadliest in modern American history, have said that they are fed up with no longer feeling safe in school and have loudly called on President Donald Trump and lawmakers to get serious about gun control. While mourning their dead classmates, Stoneman Douglas students have rallied and raised money, and are currently in the state\u2019s capital, Tallahassee, Fla., to push for gun reform.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheir activism has inspired the dregs of the right to cook up the most half-baked, unseasoned conspiracy theories they could muster to explain why students who survived a school shooting could possibly want something as batshit crazy as gun control.\n\nThe only logical answer, according to these professional paste eaters, is that these students are really professional actors.\n\nThat\u2019s what one message from an aide to Florida state Rep. Shawn Harrison alleged, according to the Miami Herald. The paper reports that the Republican\u2019s aide \u201cused state email to send a photo of two students with this message to a reporter: \u2018Both kids in the picture are not students here but actors that travel to various crisis when they happen.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was untrue, and Harrison blamed the aide for the \u201cinsensitive and inappropriate allegation.\u201d That aide is now on leave.\n\nThat was far from the worst of it. More from the Herald:\n\nA blogger at Gateway Pundit, a far-right, pro-Trump website, wrote a piece calling one of the leading student voices \u201ca plant.\u201d It included a picture of student David Hogg with a circle around his head and this statement: \u201cSon of FBI agent.\u201d Hogg was among the first Stoneman Douglas students to appear on networks and cable news demanding tougher laws from state and federal lawmakers. Former U.S. Congressman Allen West, a Republican who served a single term in South Florida as a Tea Party star, also joined in. In one Twitter post, he lumped shooter Nikolas Cruz with five Americans of Middle Eastern descent who claimed connections to terrorist groups. There is no indication that 19-year-old Cruz, who state records show has lived much of his life in Broward County, was a follower of any Muslim terror group.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe allegations around student David Hogg are especially wild, with Twitter users alternately claiming that he had graduated years ago, that he is a filmmaker and reporter, and that an earpiece he used during a live television interview (when, um, earpieces are necessary to hear the in-studio reporter) was actually being used so he could be fed answers.\n\nBusy guy, that Hogg.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the Herald reports, there were also those conspiracy theorists (like the ones who claim the Holocaust and the mass school shooting at Newtown, Conn.\u2019s Sandy Hook Elementary never happened) who denied the Parkland shooting ever happened.\n\nNot surprisingly, some of these theories appear to have been pushed by pro-Russian bots on social media.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerhaps no one captured the deplorable spirit of the whole affair better than convicted felon and global brand ambassador of the sunken place, Dinesh D\u2019Souza, who spent much of Tuesday mocking the Parkland students via his Twitter account.\n\n\u201cWorst news since their parents told them to get summer jobs,\u201d D\u2019Souza wrote Tuesday, commenting on a photo of the students appearing shocked and dismayed as Florida lawmakers voted down a bill to ban assault weapons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the survivors, a 16-year-old girl from Parkland, responded to the grown-ass man bullying her and her classmates on Twitter:\n\n\u201cActually for me the worst news I got was that 17 people died in my school,\u201d Sarah Chadwick wrote, adding that one of her best friends was shot twice and many more students were injured. \u201cBut sure, keep making us look like we don\u2019t know anything when in reality what we\u2019re doing is much much much bigger than you can imagine.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the far right\u2019s desire to write off and disqualify the students who have taken it upon themselves to keep gun control at the forefront of the country\u2019s political conversation, this much is clear: Ultraconservative gun lovers are shook. And they have reason to be: Trump recently said he\u2019d be open to some gun control measures, such as bumping up the age limit for owning certain firearms to 21, as well as banning \u201cbump stocks\u201d (a modification that simulates automatic fire\u2014that wasn\u2019t used in the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting).\n\nTrump is supposed to meet Wednesday with survivors of the Parkland shooting, as well as survivors of the school shootings in Newtown and Columbine, Colo., as he attempts to shift focus to school safety and away from the burning shitstorm of scandals that have engulfed the White House recently.", "keywords": ["school", "theories", "reform", "douglas", "right", "parkland", "used", "aide", "survivors", "shooting", "state", "students", "stoneman", "far", "seeking", "fla", "gun"], "polarity": 0.03770473970473971, "subjectivity": 0.46488156288156285},

This, despite the fact that the Versace family has issued a press release calling the series\u2014based on Vanity Fair correspondent Maureen Orth\u2019s book Vulgar Favors\u2014\u201ca work of fiction.\u201d\n\nDonatella Versace, sister of Gianni and heir to the brand, has flatly stated that she \u201cwill not be watching.\u201d And truly, I can\u2019t imagine\u2014even with the genius casting of Darren Criss from Glee as Versace\u2019s deranged murderer, Andrew Cunanan; singer Ricky Martin as Gianni\u2019s partner; Oscar winner Penelope Cruz playing Donatella; and Edgar Ramirez as Gianni himself\u2014that the series could possibly capture the brilliant life and work of the late designer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s hard to make movies about real magic. That\u2019s exactly what taking part in Versace\u2019s family business was like. With knees trembling, I stepped onto Versace\u2019s Milan runway for the first time in the early \u201990s. At the time, I had never before seen clothes up close and personal that screamed sex, drugs, rock and roll, money and L-I-F-E so articulately.\n\nWhat I loved most about Versace was that he made being ordinary impossible. Every millimeter of his clothes was drenched in color and patterns playfully layered on top of more patterns, then fastened with gold Medusa medallions or gilded bondage buckles shackling plunging necklines, and skirts slit thigh-high onto bodies more than willing to carry his message forth into the world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat message was: If you\u2019ve got it, flaunt it\u2014and then flaunt it some more.\n\nWorking with Versace was a trip through the looking glass, where the boundaries of what it meant to be new money or old money, a slut or a lady, were totally killed, crushed and destroyed. It was like walking the halls of Versailles, or standing at the foot of the Great Pyramid of Giza, or looking up at the Chrysler Building\u2014all of which are on a such a scale, you can only be overwhelmed, in the best way, and forced to dream of what\u2019s possible.\n\nVersace\u2019s dresses transformed women into beacons of light, painted in celebratory, blazing columns of color. When I wear head-to-toe Versace, the mixture of inspiration and envy coming at me from onlookers feels electric. This is how I felt that Versace\u2014who was, incidentally, a very quiet man\u2014moved through the world, courting both inspiration and envy because he was so unapologetically himself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI always thought that Versace was a very, very shy person deep down,\u201d says my great friend Andr\u00e9 Leon Talley, former creative director of American Vogue, who was also a confidant and collaborator of Versace\u2019s\u2014and my entree into the House of Versace as a model.\n\nVersace made my knees tremble for many reasons back in the early \u201990s. When I first saw his clothes, I was overwhelmed, even intimidated, by the fabulousness. Coming to understand that his little sister, Donatella, was his muse and his heart, and that his clothes were his way of giving his heart to her, gave me the courage to make those epic struts down the runway.\n\nAnd it was a runway like no other before or since; hand-laid with Italian marble brought in specially to every venue for the show, illuminated by the most skillful lighting crews in the business. Each model had her own spotlight trained on her every step.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c[Gianni] instinctively had a sense of the personality of models, casting his shows with fierce editing, and fierce rehearsals the night before a presentation,\u201d Talley says.\n\nAnd truly, it was always a cliffhanger to see what clothes and which models would make the final cut after rehearsals that could last into the wee hours of the morning\u2014sometimes as long as six hours the night before a show. And yet, whether you made it or you didn\u2019t\u2014one season, I was cut because my hips were one-quarter inch too large for a sheath dress\u2014you still had a sense that you were always welcome into the family.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPaterfamilias\u201d was a perfect description of Gianni Versace. \u201cIn many ways, he created a fashion family through his favorite band of supermodels; not only on his runway but in huge Avedon campaigns that were an extension of his life through fashion. He lived and slept fashion,\u201d says Talley of his friend.\n\nThose who knew him knew his siblings\u2014his brother, Santos, co-chief operating officer of Versace holdings, and sister, Donatella, creative director of the company\u2014as well as their children, who were his lifeblood as much as fashion.\n\n\u201cAfter his collections, he loved nothing more than taking the flight from Milan to Miami, where, sadly, he ended his life,\u201d Talley recalls.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat I remember most about Versace was that he gave us permission to be rock-star spectacular in everyday life. He threw down the velvet gauntlet, daring you to make the ordinary extraordinary. May he always be remembered for carrying the torch for creating the most spectacular and authentic image of ourselves. That\u2019s real magic.\n\nYou can judge for yourself if Ryan Murphy gets it right with Versace\u2019s story when it premieres Wednesday night on FX. But just to prove that #VersaceMagic is still very much alive, I want to leave you with a quick hit of it via Bruno Mars and Zendaya.\n\nBruno Mars via YouTube", "keywords": ["versace", "gianni", "runway", "money", "night", "house", "long", "talley", "versaces", "sister", "clothes", "reign", "life"], "polarity": 0.2193313800021117, "subjectivity": 0.5629909724421918},

However, in recent days, students Josh Gallagher and Connor Dietrich are refuting that narrative, both expressing disgust toward Gard on Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Twitter, Gallagher wrote that Gard \u201ccalled himself a hero, and ... the media portrayed him as a hero when in reality he is the opposite.\u201d\n\nGallagher said that he was in Gard\u2019s class when the fire alarm went off and students started filing out. Then they heard gunshots, and about 15 of them stopped in their tracks before running back toward the classroom. At that point, however, Gard locked the door and refused to let them back in, Gallagher said.\n\n\u201cWe were stuck in the hall for four total minutes, ducking and in fear for our lives,\u201d Gallagher wrote. He said that another teacher eventually let him and the other students into another classroom, but the teen said that Gard \u201cleft 75% of his students out in the hallway to be slaughtered.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGard, for his part, did a phone interview with CBS Miami while he and some of the students were still sheltered in his classroom, less than two hours after the shooting, awaiting the all-clear from police.\n\nGallagher pointed out that the teacher had been interviewed by multiple media outlets as a hero.\n\n\u201cHe is nothing but a coward,\u201d Gallagher said. \u201cHe has revictimized the students he left out of his class by calling himself a hero.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDietrich, who was one of the kids left in the hallway, told a similar story.\n\n\u201cAs one of the kids left in the hallway I want people to understand how terrifying and defenseless I personally felt,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cThe person I had to rely on left us to die and that\u2019s not okay.\u201d\n\nGard, meanwhile, said that he was just following protocol that mandated all doors be kept locked during an active-shooter drill or real-life emergency. He told the Sun-Sentinel that he was surprised that a student and his father were upset after the fact.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI looked back down the hall and no one was around\u2014no one,\u201d Gard said, acknowledging that 13 students had lagged behind and had wound up being locked out. \u201cYou have to close the door. That\u2019s protocol. We have no choice.\u201d\n\nGard said that he and the students who had gotten into the classroom were huddled in the dark by the desk when they heard loud banging on the door. He said that by the time he walked over to the door (an action he said was also prohibited), the banging had stopped.\n\n\u201cFast-forward to Sunday, when the parents came back for an open house,\u201d he added. \u201cAll of a sudden, this kid comes over and starts screaming at me.

That shooting has led to discussion about possibly arming teachers in the event of an active shooter situation, an idea endorsed by President Donald Trump.\n\nAlong those lines, the Florida House Appropriations Committee just recently approved training teachers to carry guns in class under the direction of local law enforcement, if school superintendents or school boards approve. The state\u2019s Senate Appropriations Committee gave the nod to a similar bill later the same day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut what if that armed teacher was, in fact, the aggressor instead of the savior?\n\nThe situation in Georgia could have ended a lot differently.

It was an adorable gimmick, and enough to raise the question: Is Cross Colours due for a comeback?\n\nLaunched in 1989 by Carl Jones and T.J. Walker, the black-owned urban-streetwear label marketed itself as \u201cclothing without prejudice\u201d and was a perfect fit for the era of new jack swing, a Fresh Prince and \u201chappy\u201d hip-hop\u2014not to mention how well the clothing coordinated with our African medallions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDistinguished by boxy silhouettes\u2014worn intentionally even more oversized, of course\u2014Cross Colours\u2019 trademark bright-hued schemes were initially inspired by a swatch of kente cloth, as Walker told Bobby Kim\u2019s The Hundreds magazine in 2014:\n\nIt elevated into a lifestyle, a collection, a look, a style. It morphed. ... For us, the colors were not only for the people, but for the fabric, for the thread, for the united force of people. Gang violence was also very prevalent at that time. So then we said Cross Colours for all that too \u2013 to unite the colors of the gangs.\n\nThe brand was a hit, dominating the early-\u201990s urban-fashion landscape, and seen on everyone from Muhammad Ali to Paula Abdul. And then, just as quickly as it peaked, it fell, due in large part to its affiliation with Merry-Go-Round\u2014one of the era\u2019s premier fast-fashion retailers\u2014which declared bankruptcy and defaulted upon millions of dollars in orders from Cross Colours in the process.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe downward spiral would continue as trademarks changed hands; eventually leading the brand to become dormant for the next two decades.\n\nBut if Cross Colours\u2019 appearance on the Grammy stage came as a surprise to most, it\u2019s only because Walker and Jones have taken a tactical approach to quietly rebuilding their brand, beginning to harness the power of social media several years ago to gauge the interest of, and access to, a new generation, as they told Kim in 2014:\n\nWe\u2019re trying to sort out how we really want to present ourselves. ... Is it all vintage? Do we have better pricing? Higher pricing? So we\u2019re going through that \u2013 the motions right now. And what do we really mean to the consumer today? It\u2019s a younger, different generation. Do they know our brand? So we start with a little bit of Instagram and now we have 5,000 followers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat following is now over 25,000\u2014and rising since Sunday night. [Editor\u2019s note: As of press time, we are still awaiting comment from Cross Colours.]\n\nBut while Bruno Mars and Co. rocked the classic baseball jerseys and bucket hats that Gen X instantly waxed nostalgic over, a visit to the Cross Colours site offers a refreshing update on the aesthetic, in addition to \u201cretro reissues\u201d\u2014where there was not an orange jersey in sight. Military-inspired looks and message T-shirts are in abundance, as well as a surprisingly sexy underwear line perfectly made for peeking out of the waistband of your saggy jeans.\n\nAnd while we\u2019re not sure we\u2019re ready to rock rainbow stripes again (sorry, Cardi), we have to admit that just seeing the brand back in action takes us back to a happier time and place.

According to dashcam footage released of the incident, Yanez told Castile not to reach for his gun, to which Castile replied, \u201cI\u2019m not pulling it out.\u201d\n\nYanez fired seven bullets into the car anyway, killing Castile.\n\nThe day after the fatal shooting of Castile, the NRA offered a tepid response, saying, \u201cThe reports from Minnesota are troubling and must be thoroughly investigated.\u201d The organization promised it would have more to say \u201conce all the facts are known.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the facts became known, and as Yanez went to court and eventually was found not guilty in Castile\u2019s death, the NRA remained silent. It wasn\u2019t until a year later that Dana Loesch, speaking on behalf of the organization, called Castile\u2019s death \u201ca terrible tragedy that could have been avoided.\u201d\n\nA month later, speaking for her own fool self, Loesch appeared to blame Castile for his own death. When a Twitter user questioned whether the NRA\u2019s slow, lukewarm responses to Castile\u2019s death had to do with his race, Loesch replied, \u201cHe was also in possession of a controlled substance and a firearm simultaneously, which is illegal.\u201d (Castile and his fiancee had smoked weed prior to being pulled over, and Yanez claimed that his rash, deadly response was because he smelled weed in the car.)\n\nValerie Castile has forgotten none of it.\n\n\u201cMy son was one of the good guys, but him being black, obviously they didn\u2019t see him as a good guy,\u201d she told the Daily News. She added that the NRA has yet to say anything about her son, which isn\u2019t exactly true.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe organization has. But the response was so tepid, so devoid of conviction, that one wonders why it even bothered.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t say anything because my son was black. My son went through the same programs as every gun owner. But they started nitpicking, \u2018He should have done this, he should have done that,\u2019\u201d Valerie Castile said of LaPierre and law enforcement officials. \u201cThe bottom line is that he told the officer he had a weapon, and the officer became a selfish man, only thinking about his own life and family. He chose to shoot my son several times. One of the bullets was 16 inches from that baby in the backseat.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was a good guy,\u201d Castile, 61, said of her son. \u201cHe went through a rigorous process to get his gun. He told the truth and let the officer know he had it. What happened to my good guy? He was shot down like an animal. He was still in his seatbelt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat car was his coffin,\u201d she added.\n\nShe also called out LaPierre\u2019s proposal that arming educators would make schools safer: \u201cArming the schools will make them more like a battlefield. If everyone has guns, bullets will be flying everywhere.

Sadly, one of the few true beacons of hope to push back against the oppressive regime that is the Trump administration is a 79-year-old trailblazer and pioneer, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), affectionately known as \u201cAuntie Maxine.\u201d\n\n\n\nFrom day one, Auntie Maxine has been adamant that she had no interest in working with an administration that wades deep in the waters of bigotry, racism and xenophobia.\n\n\u201cMy feet are firmly planted on the ground and dealing with the reality of things and what\u2019s happening and what\u2019s going on,\u201d she told The Root shortly after the president took office. \u201cIt has not been difficult; I just know that we are now going to have a new president. I don\u2019t care for him, I don\u2019t trust him and I know what I\u2019ve got to do.\u201d\n\nAuntie Maxine has been true to her word, whether it\u2019s been on the House Financial Services Committee, where she challenged Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to actually answer her questions\u2014it was this moment that spawned the heartfelt viral Auntie Maxine \u201creclaiming my time\u201d meme\u2014or speaking out against the atrocities of this administration whenever a microphone is in front of her. She has been adamant about Trump\u2019s impeachment and has constantly referred to the president as a con man.\n\n\u201cEverybody knows who this bully is,\u201d Waters told MSNBC\u2019s Chris Hayes on Monday, the Daily Beast reports. \u201cThis is a dishonorable human. He is a con man. He came to this job as a con man. I call him \u2018Don the Con Man.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe added: \u201cAll I know is this: If he thinks he can stop me from talking about \u2018Impeach 45,\u2019 he\u2019s got another thought coming. I am not intimidated by him. I\u2019m going to keep saying that we need to impeach him.\u201d\n\nSo Donald Trump\u2019s latest racist dog whistle to challenge Auntie Maxine\u2019s IQ falls on deaf ears because she was hip to who this president was long before he took office.\n\nIt\u2019s sad when America\u2019s aunt is probably America\u2019s toughest person and our biggest ally in the fight against blatant bigotry and racism. The president is currently running around the White House buck naked, and not one Democrat is willing to say he\u2019s not wearing any clothes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough it\u2019s heartwarming to see Waters so strong and willing to stand in her convictions against a divisive president who runs his administration like a schoolyard bully with unlimited Wi-Fi, it also saddens me that there aren\u2019t more Democrats willing to stand beside Auntie Maxine and call for Trump\u2019s ouster.\n\nAs it stands, those on the \u201cImpeach 45\u201d bandwagon are outliers for a more Rodney King, \u201cLet\u2019s all just get along\u201d Democratic vision, which is the equivalent of thinking that the schoolyard bully will understand anything but violence. At some point we\u2019ve got to move beyond reasoning. Auntie Maxine knew that from the beginning, and therefore had no intention of trying to work with this man or this administration.\n\nThey say that with age comes wisdom, and that\u2019s the advantage that Maxine Waters has over her fellow Democrats. She\u2019s faced down bullies before and knows from experience that sometimes you have to be willing to put your book bag down and stand up for yourself.

You probably recognize that combination of words and syllables from Black Moon\u2019s 1993 song \u201cWho Got da Props?\u201d off of their Enta da Stage album. But they asked a very important question, and the answer to that question is undoubtedly Belcalis Almanzar, better known to the world as Cardi B.\n\nI\u2019ve been racking my brain trying to think of who could possibly have had a better 2017 than she. Hell, her 2018 is even going well. She managed to get on the stage at the Grammys and perform with Bruno Mars\u2014the night\u2019s big winner\u2014and then end up in a freakin\u2019 Super Bowl commercial for Amazon.com\u2019s Alexa.\n\nLove her or hate her\u2014and I honestly don\u2019t know how you can hate her\u2014her glow up is real, happening on her own terms, and ultimately, she seems to be truly enjoying it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsider this: She\u2019s managed to be the first woman\u2014not Beyonc\u00e9, Nicki Minaj, Lauryn Hill, Alicia Keys\u2014to have five songs simultaneously featured in the top 10 on Billboard\u2019s Hot R&B/Hip-Hop chart. She had the indisputable song of 2017 in \u201cBodak Yellow,\u201d reaching No. 1 on the pop charts. While Nicki had a much better verse on Migos\u2019 \u201cMotorSport,\u201d half of the times I\u2019ve heard the song, the DJ cut it off after Cardi\u2019s verse. That makes NO sense, but also, I get it. This is the world we live in. Cardi B hopped on Bruno Mars\u2019 song \u201cFinesse\u201d and with the awesome video became even more endearing. I don\u2019t even know how that\u2019s possible.\n\nConsidering where most of us first saw her, I\u2019m not even sure there\u2019s a word to describe her ascent. Like most folks, I first saw her on Love & Hip Hop through DJ Self as he was trying to work with her and not work with her at the same time. She was the hotheaded Dominican from the South Bronx, N.Y., with \u201cthe teeth\u201d\u2014she got a bag and fixed those\u2014who was dating the dude in prison. She couldn\u2019t quite get anybody to check out her music in a real way.\n\nNow? She lives on the charts, performs at the Grammys, is engaged to a Migo(s), is in Super Bowl commercials and gives hilarious interviews on red carpets. Of her appearance at the Grammys, she managed to say that she had butterflies in both her stomach and her vagina, and I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s the new standard now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can understand the hesitation on the part of hip-hoppers to heap too much praise on her. She is, after all, a rapper. And I\u2019m not sure anybody would be rushing to crown her the queen of rap, especially when Nicki Minaj and Remy Ma are out there. They\u2019re rappers. Cardi B is more of a personality who decided to do like so many others: use music as her vehicle to doing something other than starving. They\u2019re not really in it for the craft; they\u2019re in it for the money.\n\nBecause I\u2019m a hip-hop head who will fight anybody over the \u201990s, I get the difficulty in being happy about this. BUT I\u2019m also a person who believes that anybody with limitations who maximizes on their opportunities and doesn\u2019t burn down the industry along the way isn\u2019t ruining the culture. She\u2019s not Vanilla Ice or Snow. Or Bo$$, who famously faked her entire life and upbringing to become a gangsta rapper. She\u2019s the real MC Gusto from CB4.\n\nCardi has both put herself and been put in positions where she could make the most of them or fumble, and thus far, she\u2019s kicked asses and taken names. By being what I can only presume is authentically her and releasing music that absolutely beats, she\u2019s gained fans and people who aren\u2019t fans but are running out of reasons to hate her. She\u2019s winning; why hate on somebody who is winning with a smile by being her best self, flaws and all?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Facebook, I saw a friend of mine point out that Cardi B should probably have been considered for best new artist at the Grammys. And that\u2019s absolutely true. The way the Grammys are set up, I\u2019m guessing she\u2019ll be up for that award in 2022. But no other artist in the past six months has gone from \u201cWe think we heard of her\u201d to being a damn-near household name like she has. People genuinely like her, and you can\u2019t force personal gravity.\n\nEarly on, I was on the struggle-to-find-the-reason-we-should-care-about-Cardi bandwagon, but somewhere along the way, I had to acknowledge that I kept saying I didn\u2019t like her but knew all the words to \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d and enjoyed her random, sometimes entirely nonsensical Instagram musings and even follow her on IG, and wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt when she got problematic.\n\nAt some point, you just have to give people their credit for doing things their way and managing to be super successful at them. That is Cardi. Do I think she\u2019ll be around for the next 10 years as an artist of note? I honestly have no idea. Maybe there\u2019s an artist in there trying to get out that will surprise us all. Or maybe not. Maybe we\u2019ve seen what she has to offer, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll keep getting until we all collectively don\u2019t want it anymore.

During a speech Thursday at a sheriffs\u2019 convention in Washington, D.C., Sessions found a way to bring up criminal records and gang violence while addressing Wednesday\u2019s school shooting in Parkland, Fla., that killed 17 people.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think effective enforcement of our gun laws, focusing on criminals and dangerous people, mentally ill people that have been\u2014where we have the legal ability to do so\u2014can reduce violence in our communities and improve public safety,\u201d Sessions said, ThinkProgress reports. \u201cIt is not good if we got gun laws that say criminals can\u2019t carry guns and they never get enforced.

Chris Murphy\u2019s calls to finally rein in America\u2019s gun problem.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe then asked the most useless rhetorical question one could ask, and yet is the thrust of every conservative talking point about gun control: \u201cIs this a problem with the gun or the shooter?\u201d (Hint: You can actually address both, and should, but whatever. Let\u2019s move on.)\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s take a look at the gun, the AR-15, what makes it so popular and, overwhelmingly, what makes it so safe\u2014what it takes to get one,\u201d she continued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIngraham then introduces her guest, a \u201csecurity and counterterror expert\u201d by the name of Aaron Cohen, but not before launching into a quick brag break about her proficiency and experience with guns, telling viewers that she\u2019s shot gun since she was 6 years old. This, of course, qualifies her to discuss gun control policy much in the same way that someone whose sole qualification of eating McDonald\u2019s cheeseburgers since they were 6 years old qualifies them to steer conversations around obesity and food and health policy.\n\nAgain, moving on.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like all weapons,\u201d Ingraham continued. \u201cIt\u2019s very dangerous in the hands of the wrong person. And if you\u2019re not trained, and if you have a criminal disposition, a violent disposition, it can be turned into a killing machine. But Chris Murphy wants to make this tonight all about the weapons.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be fair, a person with a violent disposition can certainly turn a meat cleaver, a shank or a pot of hot grits into a killing machine. That person would also amass a far lower body count. In 2016, a man in China broke into a school and stabbed 10 children before turning the knife on himself. He was the only casualty\u2014all the children survived.\n\nMeanwhile, the AR-15, as HuffPost notes, was developed for battle and \u201cspecifically designed to kill people as efficiently as possible.\u201d By USA Today\u2019s count, the AR-15 has also been the weapon of choice for eight deadly mass shootings in the last three years. It was used in Sandy Hook in Newtown, Conn.; at the Pulse Night Club in Orlando, Fla.; in San Bernardino, Calif.; and in Las Vegas.\n\nA gun expert told USA Today that the \u201cbad rap\u201d the rifle receives is likely due to \u201ccopycat\u201d killers buying the gun after seeing it featured prominently in these shootings. But it should also be noted that it\u2019s not terribly difficult to get these weapons: According to a 2016 article from The Tab, a 20-year-old man with an expired license was able to purchase an AR-15 in 20 minutes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Florida, for example, while buyers are supposed to pass a background check, there is no waiting period to purchase the AR-15; nor must a user register the gun. As more details about the gunman, Nikolas Cruz, emerge, it\u2019s clear that his school identified him as a threat: At one point, he wasn\u2019t allowed to bring a backpack to campus, one math teacher said, and he was eventually expelled. He also appears to have been a domestic abuser, but was never hit with any charges.\n\nA violent disposition\u2014but one that would pass the background checks that Florida requires.\n\nOutside of the Fox News universe, students and faculty from Douglas High literally begged lawmakers and President Donald Trump to take action:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIngraham, like much of her ilk, wasn\u2019t concerned with listening to these students and educators who just witnessed their classmates, their students and their colleagues mowed down in another gruesome act of violence. While Ingraham was praising the AR-15, a smudged gray cross sat prominently on her forehead\u2014indicating the observance of Ash Wednesday, a day of penitence. A day to express remorse and sorrow. Shame.\n\nIt\u2019s a day for observers to reflect on their mortality, and their sinfulness before God.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe dishonest discourse around gun control dished out by conservatives and sponsored by the National Rifle Association is a sin.

And then you wonder why we have a problem. That\u2019s why we have a problem. And I don\u2019t think we should play games. Now, I never did polling on that. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s popular. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s unpopular. Probably you\u2019ll have some people who say, \u201cOh, that\u2019s not nice.\u201d But these people are killing our kids and they\u2019re killing our families. And we have to do something.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Mexicans and gangs:\n\nHow about ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement]? These ICE guys are tough as hell. They go in and they are not playing games. You know, the only thing I hate to say, not so politically correct, but the only thing these gang members understand is toughness. I hate to say it. They\u2019re not interested in genius. They\u2019re not interested\u2014they\u2019re interested in somebody who is tougher than them, that\u2019s what, and we have the toughest people you\u2019ve ever seen, and they went out in Long Island and they grabbed them by the neck and they threw them in the paddy.

So in the interest of time, I\u2019ll only cover where my prerogative leads me. Feel free to cue up select tracks from the catalog of the legendary Kang of R&B, Bobby Brown, while reading this.\n\n\n\nOverall, I would say that once again, the BET Awards proved itself to be the most vital and entertaining awards show on television. I get that it\u2019s a thing for some to pile on BET, but, beloveds, y\u2019all will never be this gassed about the MTV Video Music Awards, the Billboard Awards, the Oscars or any other awards show. Some of us will repeat that sentiment every year until y\u2019all shut the hell up.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow that I\u2019ve gotten the positive affirmation out of the way, let\u2019s discuss some of the missteps in terms of production. Clearly, this was the first show without Stephen Hill at the helm. The show lasted 30 minutes longer than scheduled. I love my people and I love my people\u2019s awards show, but four hours is a long time\u2014especially when your preshow is two hours.\n\nMeanwhile, this show has suffered from technical difficulties from time to time in the past, but c\u2019mon, nah, you can\u2019t cue up a performance and then say, \u201cWait-wait-wait, let\u2019s have a do-over.\u201d Shoutout to SZA, though, for handling that with grace. Still, there seemed to be some occasional sound issues, and the cues were off. Also, who thought that conveyor belt or whatever you call that moving contraption was a good idea? So glad no Negro fell and proceeded to curse out Debra Lee and Co. before presenting a humanitarian award.\n\n\n\nAs for the host, Leslie Jones, my lord, is she blessed with the gift of volume. Very few people can make Mo\u2019Nique seem \u201clow energy\u201d by comparison, but that Leslie Jones\u2014whew, she could wake up half the world if she ever decided to sing \u201cOne Sweet Day\u201d in the shower.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGIF\n\nLike, I can hear her even here.\n\n\n\nIn any event, I was reminded that while I hated the time racist trolls picked on the Saturday Night Live cast member, her actual humor can be an acquired taste. She had some funny moments, but there was something amiss with her monologue and a few of those sketches. You could tell the crowd felt similarly at times, \u2019cause Jones got plenty o\u2019 church claps as she cracked jokes. But she looked nice in red, and she seemed extremely happy to be hosting. I\u2019m going to leave it on that note and wish her well should she get booked again.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOK, the performances.\n\n\n\nBruno Mars: As a performer, Puerto Rican Frankie Lymon is near perfection and in a league of his own. Funny enough, he had an entire arena of black folks cheering him on while a few on Twitter debated earlier whether or not he was guilty of \u201ccultural appropriation.\u201d Much like y\u2019all\u2019s president, Minute Maid Mao, folks learn terms and don\u2019t really know what they mean, yet use them anyway. The man\u2019s music may be derivative, but he respects black music and black culture and vocalizes that respect often, and obviously we know that otherwise he wouldn\u2019t have opened the BET Awards.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, as far as that lil\u2019 clip of him dozing off while Mary J. Blige performed, I don\u2019t think he was bored at all. No, no, he was just coming down. Off what? I doubt I\u2019m allowed to say anything else, so let\u2019s move along.\n\nMary J. Blige: I love her for beginning her set with that song that basically is one big fuck-you to her soon-to-be ex-husband, Kendu Isaacs. Isaacs went on Instagram after the performance to express his grievances and say he wants to talk to Mary. Kendu, we don\u2019t care, and we resent you for what you\u2019ve done to the Queen. Shoo, sucker. Shoo.\n\n\n\nThat said, I wish Blige had done \u201cGlow Up\u201d instead of \u201cLove Yourself.\u201d A$AP Rocky should start a beauty brand, though.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFuture: If you can\u2019t say \u201cPercocet, Molly, Percocet\u201d during a performance of \u201cMask Off,\u201d you have been officially sabotaged. The staging was sexy, though, and as a member of Future Hive, I feel obligated to say I still enjoyed everything for what it was. I also liked Kendrick Lamar dressed like a Negro League Jax Teller.\n\nBig Sean: Was that a Beyonc\u00e9 tribute? Even so, I appreciate Sammy Davis Jr. in snack form trying to offer more. Lord knows most rappers don\u2019t dare make as much effort.\n\nChris Brown: That song sounds like every other song he makes. Same for the performance. Light Ike danced down, but you know, heaven knows he needs a hug, new creative director and artistic direction. And did he violate his restraining order being there? Please advise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMigos: I thought I was sick of \u201cBad and Boujee\u201d until they performed it and I leaped from my seat to let my feathers fly freely. I love them. They are rock stars; stay mad, Hip-Hop Hannibal (Joe Budden).\n\n\n\nTrey Songz: Trey Songz is fine, but what were those vocals? Trey Songz is fine, but what was that song? Trey Songz is fine, but what happened?\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nXscape: I am very happy for them, especially Tiny. They all looked good, although I don\u2019t completely disagree with those that say they weren\u2019t all dressed for the same show. You got the sense that they had some sound issues because LaTocha Scott noticeably took her ear piece out midway. Either way, love them and loved their performance. They need to go on tour.\n\n\n\nEl DeBarge: Black people love George Michael, and El DeBarge seems to be locked in a closet and only let out when the BET Awards are on, so this pairing made sense. And it was good.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe New Edition cast members: My first reaction was to objectify the adult actors, but I\u2019ll tuck in the thot and just say that, once again, they were fantastic. I really wish Luke James could score a moment with his own music. He\u2019s a phenomenal Johnny Gill, but we need to get him some music that\u2019ll let him body-roll and sing like that with his original music.\n\n\n\nThe real New Edition: BET has really earned back its investment with the movie. Bobby Brown\u2019s mint accessory made my night, and I like that even if he\u2019s moving a lil\u2019 slower these days, he still keeps up. If that set was a tour commercial, they succeeded with me.\n\nSZA: She sounded great\u2014awful opening that was no fault of her own notwithstanding. However, she probably should have performed in the first or second hour. The sequencing of performances felt off.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGIF\n\nTamar Braxton: Tamar Braxton can sing exceptionally well, but she was not singing a lick during her performance of \u201cMy Man.\u201d So why she was aggressively moving her wig like it was dipped in a fire ant bed before she glued it to her head is beyond me. I saved this for last because it was the absolute most.\n\nAll right, before I (let) go:\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCheers to Solange.\n\nGIF\n\nAnd Remy Ma for those wins.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBye, blacks.\n\n", "keywords": ["felt", "songz", "dont", "love", "performance", "bet", "forever", "song", "music", "chicken", "awards", "entertained", "say", "let"], "polarity": 0.18189406065456484, "subjectivity": 0.5161022287702961},

(insert next city here). Very few have called it a terrorism-related incident.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Justice, a terrorist activity is defined, in part, as:\n\nThe use of any\u2014 (a) biological agent, chemical agent, or nuclear weapon or device, or (b) explosive, firearm, or other weapon or dangerous device (other than for mere personal monetary gain), with intent to endanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals or to cause substantial damage to property.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe same legal explanation (pdf) defines a terrorist organization as \u201ca group of two or more individuals, whether organized or not, which engages in, or has a subgroup which engages in, the activities described.\u201d\n\nThe latest tragedy is directly related to our government\u2019s unwillingness to create and enforce commonsense gun laws, fueled by a criminal cabal that bribes lawmakers with barrels of cash and knowingly promotes and participates in a plot that results in the deaths of seven children every day.\n\nThe National Rifle Association kills people.\n\nThe advocates for the NRA will tell you that its only intent is to protect our Second Amendment right to own firearms. Whether or not you agree with the conservative translation of the Second Amendment, there is no doubt that the NRA\u2019s belief that every American has an unassailable right to own a gun has morphed into a semireligious philosophy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NRA\u2019s unrelenting fight against commonsense gun regulation is based on that philosophy in the same way that Nazis want to rid the world of nonwhites, and religious extremists believe that people who don\u2019t adhere to their theological philosophy should perish from the earth.\n\nIn America, it should never be illegal to believe in these things. But when these individuals form groups that engage in activities that \u201cendanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals\u201d\u2014whether it is flying a plane into a New York City building or driving a car through anti-racism protesters at a Charlottesville, Va. rally\u2014it rises to the legal definition of terrorism.\n\nThe NRA is a terrorist organization.\n\nOn Oct. 16, 2017, the city of Newark, N.J., announced a federal lawsuit against 10 drug companies that manufacture prescription opioids. In December, five suburban Illinois counties followed suit. By January, New York City, the largest city in America, did the same.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNone of these lawsuits argue that the pharmaceutical companies involved have sold defective products. Instead, they allege that the corporations that sell and market these drugs to consumers have knowingly engaged in practices that allow an otherwise legal product to end up in the wrong hands, resulting in an epidemic of addiction and death for which the public has paid the price. Therefore, the suits allege, the companies are\u2014at the very least\u2014partially responsible.\n\nThis has worked before. The 1998 Master Settlement Agreement forced tobacco manufacturers to pay $206 billion for tobacco-related deaths and illnesses. The companies also had to stop targeting youths, restrict advertising, and enact policies so that cigarettes and tobacco products wouldn\u2019t end up in the hands of children. The case revealed that Big Tobacco had covered up the dangers of its products for years by uniting to lobby lawmakers with billions of dollars and obscuring data about its poisonous product.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSounds a lot like the gun industry.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more people died from gun deaths in 2016 (38,658) than from prescription opioids (around 14,400). And 13,686 of the people killed by guns that year were under the age of 19. Even if you believe in the premise of self-protection or \u201chaters gonna hate, thugs gonna thug,\u201d when you extract the criminal element from total gun deaths, 495 of those deaths were unintentional, and another 22,938 were suicides.\n\nThe grand total of U.S. deaths from terrorism and extremist activities over the last decade is 71.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, if you added up the numbers of every American casualty of terrorism since 1865, the numbers of gun deaths in 2016 alone would dwarf it.\n\nThere is no doubt that guns are a worse problem than terrorism in America. The ease of acquiring firearms causes thousands of needless deaths in the U.S. It is a fact that states with large-capacity-magazine bans have fewer firearm-related deaths. In our examination of mass-shooting deaths, The Root found that 253 people were killed by semi-automatic assault-style weapons since 1966.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though polls show that 90 percent of Americans have no problem with mandated background checks as a prerequisite to purchasing a gun, the NRA opposes it. According to Gallup, 8 in 10 Americans favor legislation banning assault-style weapons, but the NRA fights against it. Eighty-two percent of those polled favor outlawing attachments that allow guns to fire rapidly, but the NRA lobbies against the effort.\n\nThe NRA\u2019s crusade against gun reform has nothing to do with the will of the people. It is an ideological war that kills and injures thousands of innocent people every year. It is based on a fundamentalist interpretation of the Second Amendment not shared by the American people.\n\nIt is terrorism.\n\nIn the same way that most Muslims don\u2019t support al-Qaida or the Islamic State group, and the majority of white people don\u2019t support the neo-Nazi movement or the Ku Klux Klan, most people who own firearms don\u2019t support the National Rifle Association. The NRA is not some loose confederation of well-intentioned gun owners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though the organization claims to have 5 million members (a figure that many are skeptical of), that seemingly large number accounts for only 1.5 percent of the U.S. population and less than 7 percent of gun owners. That means that 98.8 percent of the country, and 93 percent of the people who legally own firearms, want nothing to do with the NRA.\n\n\n\nAccording to OpenSecrets.org, the NRA spent an average of $3 million on lobbying in each of the past five years. This money does not come from members of the NRA\u2014it comes from gun manufacturers who give tens of million of dollars to the organization through a variety of means, including donations, sponsorship programs, advertising and revenue sharing. Taurus automatically purchases an NRA membership for every customer who buys one of its guns. Sturm, Ruger gives $1 from every purchase to the NRA.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c ...with intent to endanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals ... \u201d\n\nThe gun debate has never been about the Second Amendment. Most politicians, lawyers and legal experts agree that the right to bear arms will never be revoked. The real question is about America\u2019s unwillingness to regulate the gun industry and the NRA\u2019s ability to escape the same scrutiny as entities in similarly dangerous fields of commerce.\n\n\n\nAttorney Leslie Thompson, who works with companies on the legal protection of consumer products, told The Root: \u201cThe NRA and gun manufacturers have one advantage that the tobacco and pharmaceutical industries don\u2019t have: the Second Amendment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut the ability to exercise a constitutional right can be regulated,\u201d Thompson explained, noting that age and ID requirements are required to vote. \u201cEven the right to freedom of speech is subject to slander and libel laws to prevent fellow citizens from being recklessly injured.\u201d\n\nAlthough lawmakers, careless gun owners and retail outlets are not faultless in the scourge of firearm-related deaths that plague this country, the uniquely American epidemic of murders, mass shootings, accidents and suicides points back to this singular organization that has prioritized its fundamentalist ideology over the pain and suffering of the citizens of this country.\n\n\n\nThe NRA\u2019s complicity in thousands of deaths every year is directly related to the amount of money it funnels from gun manufacturers to lawmakers. If the public found out that another organization with the body count of the NRA was lobbying politicians and writing laws, there would be a national scandal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe National Rifle Association should not be exempt. It is more powerful and scarier than al-Qaida and the \u201calt-right\u201d combined. The trite aphorism used most often by the organization that has become a willful accessory to thousands of American murders explains it best:\n\nGuns don\u2019t kill people ...\n\nThe NRA does.", "keywords": ["dont", "right", "directly", "nras", "nra", "second", "organization", "legal", "deaths", "terrorist", "gun"], "polarity": 0.06106391924573743, "subjectivity": 0.4029339852067124},

Chappelle reminded the audience, \u201cThe only thing more frightening than watching a black man be honest in America is being a an honest black man in America.\u201d Message! Then out came a black female drummer, not only giving you African realness, but sis danced, too! Lamar better give us Motherland! \u201cIs this on cable?\u201d Chappelle asked, because Lamar was out here giving the world the realness.\n\n\n\nBy the time Lamar went onstage, he was already the winner of three Grammys. He won for best rap performance, best rap album and best music video for \u201cHumble.\u201d He and Rihanna also won best rap/sung performance for \u201cLoyalty.\u201d I\u2019m like congrats to Lamar and all, but Rihanna in that monochromatic vinyl moment was worth fawning over.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOh, and I couldn\u2019t get enough of Rihanna busting out the South African dance the gwara gwara!\n\n\n\nThe All-Black Church Choir During Sam Smith\u2019s Performance\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSam Smith was accompanied by a black church choir that stood behind him giving nothing but strong black women who were all fresh out the salon. Sam sang down on his single \u201cPray\u201d as the choir served us Baptist church.\n\nChuck Berry and Fats Domino Tribute\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJon Batiste and Gary Clark Jr. laced the stage with more rock \u2019n\u2019 roll than the Grammys deserved with their Chuck Berry and Fats Domino tribute. Late Show bandleader Batiste\u2019s laid-back style was a perfect complement to Clark\u2019s funky style. From Domino\u2019s \u201cAin\u2019t That a Shame\u201d to Berry\u2019s \u201cMaybelline,\u201d the performance reminded us all of Berry\u2019s and Domino\u2019s undeniable contributions to music.\n\n\n\nBlue Ivy Shushing Mommy and Daddy\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYeah, these front-row seats to the Grammys are great and all, but chill, Mom and Dad, you\u2019re embarrassing me.\u201d We all go through that phase where our parents are less superhero and more super annoying. I wonder what that\u2019s going to look like for Blue Ivy because she clearly runs the entire compound of the Knowles-Carters.\n\n\n\nChildish Gambino Performance\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI felt like I was in the middle of a \u201990s sex scene in a classic black movie. Donald Glover sang \u201cTerrified\u201d and the vibes of the entire show changed. There are moments during many shows when singers bring out their backup singers to riff together. One of the most iconic was when Mariah Carey brought out Trey Lorenz during a performance of \u201cI\u2019ll Be There,\u201d and going forward, everyone wanted to hear that version of the song. Glover brought out child actor J.D. McCrary (who is featured on the song), and he is easily a vocal genius.\n\n\n\nGlover was quietly impressive. He\u2019s well on his way to EGOT territory, as he\u2019s already holding two Emmys and a Grammy. An Oscar and a Tony aren\u2019t far-fetched.\n\n\n\nDave Chappelle Shades Whole Show Over Tribe Called Quest Snub\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDave Chappelle was asked to present the award for the best rap album, and he did so, in a very Chappelle way. He gave several shoutouts, including one to A Tribe Called Quest, calling them all out by name, then making a reference to the group\u2019s 2016 album, We Got It from Here ... Thank You 4 Your Service.\n\n\u201cI have so much love and respect to all the nominees tonight,\u201d Chappelle began, \u201cand I just want to take a moment to honor Jarobi, Ali Shaheed Muhammad, Q-Tip, sometimes Busta, sometimes Consequence and, of course, always and forever Phife Dawg. Can we kick it?\u201d\n\nAnd then Kendrick Lamar won the Grammy, giving him his fifth win for the night! \u201cGod up top all the time,\u201d Lamar said. \u201cI thought it was about the accolades, the cars and clothes, but it\u2019s really about expressing yourself and putting that paint on the canvas for the world to evolve for the next generation and the next.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUgh, Kendrick Lamar for president!\n\n(Sidenote: When Dave Chappelle won the Grammy for best comedy album, mostly what he had to say in his acceptance speech was, \u201cSee you Monday.\u201d)\n\n\n\nCardi B and Bruno Mars Drippin\u2019 in \u2018Finesse\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s hard to watch Cardi B without being excited thinking of her meteoric rise and smiling. I\u2019m just so proud of her, out here getting nominated and performing at her first Grammys! Being nominated up against Jay-Z and Kendrick Lamar is crazy and, yes, \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d still slaps.\n\nIt was great seeing Grammy god Bruno Mars and Cardi kill their In Living Color tribute of a performance on the Grammys stage. Bruno\u2019s dance break hyped the crowd up with the best \u201990s moves you\u2019ve seen since House Party.\n\nShaggy Kept Coming Out With Sting\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSting wants us to know that he\u2019s all about the islands with his new collaboration with Shaggy. From their subway skit (that went on way too long) with the show\u2019s host, James Corden, to their performance, I felt force-fed, but I am honestly curious about this odd couple.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s evidently a joint album coming, and they sang \u201cDon\u2019t Make Me Wait,\u201d which actually does slap. I\u2019m low-key excited for this unlikely pairing. I might be lying.\n\n\n\nShemar Moore and Eve Introducing SZA\u2019s Performance\n\nWhat\u2019s black as hell? Having actor and picture-of-perfection Shemar Moore and rapper and host Eve introducing SZA to the stage for her first Grammys performance. And SZA went off!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd my feelings are a little bit hurt that SZA was the most nominated woman at the Grammys this year and left with nothing. I\u2019m glad she didn\u2019t win for best new artist. We all know that curse.\n\n\n\nFire and Fury Spoken-Word Auditions\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of host James Corden\u2019s skits consisted of various celebrities with not-so-positive opinions on your president sitting down to do dramatic readings of the book Fire and Fury. The lineup was perfect: John Legend, Snoop Dogg, Cher, Cardi B and Hillary Clinton. The skit was glorious.\n\nAnd an honorable mention goes to Cardi B\u2019s red-carpet moment with E! host Giuliana Rancic. When she asked Cardi how she was feeling, Cardi cardi-ed and said: \u201cI\u2019m feeling good. I\u2019m feeling nervous, overwhelmed, everything. Butterflies in my stomach and vagina.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was clear Rancic couldn\u2019t remember the Cardi B lyrics she desperately wanted to summon; nor could she handle Cardi (or Lil Uzi Vert, for that matter), but Cardi handled her own and made for another hilarious, viral moment.\n\n\n\nDid you watch the 2018 Grammys?

What time of year, you ask? The time of year when President Racist von WallBuilder reads his prepared speech from a teleprompter, and a roomful of fat, rich white guys and affluent white women applaud as if the world were crafted from his tiny hands. This is also the time when people of color throw glorious amounts of side eye, teeth-sucking sneers and reluctant golf claps as the president presents his State of the Union\u2014or Uniom, as it were, on some tickets.\n\n\n\nBut this year, unlike years past, the Democrats are piping mad! Oh, they are super mad, son. In fact, many of them have planned silent protests just to show how mad they are. I mean, it\u2019s the Democrats, so what did you expect? Did you really think someone was planning to show a true level of disgust toward a president so evil and vile that he\u2019s started to make George W. Bush look palatable?\n\n\n\nBelow is a listing of planned protests that might even be effective if the president actually cared about the rest of the 99 percent.\n\n\n\nOff the top, Reps. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), Frederica S. Wilson (D-Fla.) and Gregory W. Meeks (D-N.Y.) aren\u2019t attending the president\u2019s address. Everyone knows that Auntie Maxine is not here to play nice with this president. Wilson and the president have never been on good terms, but that rift grew wider when the president reportedly told the widow of Sgt. La David Johnson that \u201che knew what he\u2019d signed up for.\u201d Wilson took offense at the heartless comment, and Trump, as he\u2019s been known to do, began attacking the congresswoman on Twitter. So when it came to this year\u2019s State of the Union, Wilson knew that the president didn\u2019t deserve her presence or her sweet cowboy hat!\n\n\n\n\u201cTo go would be to honor the president and I don\u2019t think he deserves to be honored at this time, after being so hateful towards black people and then black countries,\u201d she told CNN.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeeks had this to say about this year\u2019s State of the Union address, the New York Post reports: \u201cI cannot give this man, who does not respect me, the respect to be in that audience. I will not be there.\u201d\n\nOther Democrats who have noted that they won\u2019t be attending include Reps. Barbara Lee (Calif.) and John Lewis (Ga.); Illinois Reps. Danny Davis, Jan Schakowsky and Bobby Rush; and Reps. Albio Sires (N.J.), Earl Blumenauer (Ore.) and Pramila Jayapal (Wash.), who had this to say earlier this month on why she wouldn\u2019t be attending:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExpect this list of nonattendees to grow before the president hits the podium and spits out his first lie.\n\n\n\nBecause the president is a sexual predator who was captured on audio boasting that his financial success allows him to kiss and grab women he doesn\u2019t know by their \u201cpussy,\u201d some members of the Congressional Black Caucus plan to wear all black to the event in support of the #MeToo movement and will wear pins that honor the memory and legacy of Recy Taylor, a black woman who, in 1944, was kidnapped and sexually assaulted by a group of white men.\n\n\n\nAccording to CNN, Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-N.J.), a co-chairwoman of the Congressional Caucus on Black Women & Girls, plans to bring Taylor\u2019s niece as her guest to Tuesday night\u2019s remarks. Rep. Mike Quigley (D-Ill.) will be bringing Erin Walton, the executive director of Rape Victim Advocates, as his plus one; Fatima Goss Graves, the president of the National Women\u2019s Law Center, will be a guest of Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.); and Danielle McGuire, an author and historian who has researched and written about Taylor, will be a guest of Rep. Brenda Lawrence (D-Mich.).\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSan Juan, Puerto Rico, Mayor Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz, who went toe-to-toe with the president for his lack of concern after Hurricane Maria ravaged parts of Puerto Rico, will accompany Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.).\n\n\n\nSeveral Congress members are using their invitations to bring faces of the immigration debate, specially those affected by the current stalemate over DACA, or the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, affecting young people brought illegally to the U.S. as children.\n\nSome of the more prominent faces of the debate who will be in attendance: Cindy Garcia, the wife of Jorge Garcia, who was deported to Mexico earlier this month after living in the U.S. for 30 years. The Garcia family\u2019s emotional goodbye inside the airport was captured on video and went viral. Cindy will be the guest of Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRep. Ed Perlmutter (D-Colo.) has invited Viviana Andazola Marquez, whose father, Melecio Andazola Morales, was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement after going in for a scheduled appointment to get his green card, Roll Call reports.\n\nLast but not least, Melania Trump is expected to make an appearance. I know that, on the surface, her presence wouldn\u2019t be seen as a protest, and truthfully, it isn\u2019t, but ever since reports surfaced that the president paid off porn actress Stormy Daniels, the first lady has been noticeably absent.\n\nAccording to the New York Times: \u201cMelania Trump, a notoriously private first lady, made three very public decisions: She canceled a trip abroad with the president, made an impromptu visit to the Holocaust Memorial Museum and flew to Mar-a-Lago, where she spent part of her short trip relaxing at the spa.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer presence is a reminder that she\u2019s willing to save her marriage, and my hope is that the camera continues to pan across her face to show how truly dead she is inside. I hope that these two continue to stay together for as long as they both shall live and she continues to haunt his waking life. Not divorcing him feels like a protest against his happiness, and I think this could be the best silent protest of them all.", "keywords": ["congress", "think", "trump", "trash", "union", "guest", "women", "white", "rep", "protests", "members", "state", "reps", "president", "lists", "black", "wilson"], "polarity": 0.08556348675833969, "subjectivity": 0.43977479628214916},

It was a true tribute without feeling like karaoke night at your local bar. From the purple outfit to the eyeliner, Bruno Mars knew he was making Prince proud as he performed \u201cLet\u2019s Go Crazy.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut even before Bruno Mars stepped onstage, there was the Time, the band Prince put together around singer Morris Day in 1981, doing an abbreviated medley of two of their hits.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re not doing \u201cthe bird\u201d while listening to the Time, you\u2019re going about life so wrong.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then there was Chance. If you haven\u2019t been to church in a while, let him take you there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot only did he bring praise and worship to the Grammys, but he also made history. Chance became the first artist to win a Grammy without selling physical copies of his music\u2014or selling much of his music at all. Even Barack Obama was like, \u201cBoy, what are you doing not selling music?\u201d But if awards were his goal, it looks like it paid off. Chance won for Best New Artist, Best Rap Album and Best Rap Solo Performance.\n\n\u201cThis is for every indie artist!\u201d Chance shouted after winning Best Rap Album for his May 2016 gospel-infused hip-hop mixtape Coloring Book.\n\nThis year\u2019s Grammys proved that black artists aren\u2019t afraid to raise their voices, make a statement and be heard.

Kuhn-Fricker alerted the principal of the high school that her daughter and Nicholas attended, warning the administrator of the violent account, according to the Washington Post.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe also staged an intervention with her daughter, seemingly convincing her to break up with the 17-year-old boy. Days later, Nicholas would kill her and her husband, Scott Fricker, in their home in Reston, Va., according to police.\n\nNow HuffPost has revealed the Twitter account Nicholas reportedly used, providing stark details about the nature of his beliefs and inspirations. The Twitter handle, @doctorpepper35, under the name Kevin Gallo, has since been suspended, but the HuffPost article contains several screenshot captures from the account.\n\nFrom HuffPost:\n\nAlmost three months before the murders, the teenager from Lorton, Va., praised a book called Siege, an obscure, ominous work written by James Mason, a neo-Nazi devotee of Charles Manson. The 1992 book, republished last year by hyperviolent white nationalist sect Atomwaffen Division, is essentially a call to \u201cHelter Skelter\u201d racist insurrection. Giampa also retweeted an endorsement of The Turner Diaries, William Luther Pierce\u2019s infamous white nationalist novel about race war, often found on the bookshelf of American domestic terrorists.\ufeff\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNicholas saved the worst attacks for Jews, Muslims and members of the LGTBQ community:\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve already talked 1 tranny into suicide and I\u2019m working on another 2 \ud83d\ude33,\u201d he bragged. Then he posted a rainbow lynching image, encouraging gay and transgender people to commit suicide. \u201c#transrightsarehumanrights is an oxymoron because trannies aren\u2019t \u2018people,\u2019\u201d Giampa tweeted that day.\ufeff\n\nAnd this:\n\nA white Europe without Jewish or Muslim individuals \u201csounds like heaven,\u201d Giampa tweeted on Nov. 11. The next day, he tweeted \u201cThe jews are everyone\u2019s enemy.\u201d He tweeted in support of nationalist marchers in Poland seeking to rid the country of Muslims and Jews. \u201cMuslims and jews are incapable of assimilating and a threat to their culture,\u201d he wrote.\ufeff\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs HuffPost shows, leading up to the double murder, Nicholas openly identified as a Nazi, retweeted pro-Hitler memes, and called for various neo-Nazi and white nationalist groups to come together as part of a \u201cwhite revolution.\u201d\n\nHis social media track record is disturbing, but in a way that has become increasingly familiar.\n\nThis is the part of the HuffPost report that has me messed up:\n\n\u201cI apologize for all the unhappiness for everyone. I am sincerely sorry,\u201d said one of Giampa\u2019s family members, who broke into tears on the phone. \u201cIn the end, we need one more gun law. Any address, anywhere, that has mental illness, there cannot be guns.\u201d\ufeff\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet me first say this: Nicholas and his girlfriend did go to a private high school for students with special needs, according to HuffPost. The nature and extent of his mental or behavioral issues is still largely unknown.\n\nBut it\u2019s dangerous and irresponsible to isolate Nicholas\u2019 \u201cmental illness\u201d as the reason for the cold-blooded murder he\u2019s accused of\u2014not when he publicly and loudly voiced his desire to exterminate entire groups of people.\n\nThis is a young man who mowed a 40-foot swastika into a community field in his neighborhood. A young man whose mother, who reportedly voiced support for Confederate generals and monuments on her Facebook page, took her son to a gun range to fire a submachine gun. A young man who unabashedly praised murderers and dictators and called for race wars.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are some psychiatrists who believe that \u201cextreme racism\u201d is, in fact, a mental illness. But to blame mental illness for gun violence is just incorrect: As CNN reports, studies have shown that \u201cthe vast majority of people with severe mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or severe depression, are no more likely to be violent than anyone else.\u201d\n\nIn fact, people suffering from severe mental illness are 10 times more likely to be victims of violent crime.\n\nWhich is what makes the quote from Nicholas\u2019 family member so appalling, even as a part of me understands the desire to protect a loved one by branding him a tragic example of mental illness gone unchecked. It preserves, to some degree, his innocence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe problem is that this desire obscures who Nicholas really is, who he proclaimed himself over and over to be. And an unwillingness to see that\u2014to listen when the monster tells you his name\u2014all but guarantees that more of the same will continue.\n\nRead more at HuffPost.", "keywords": ["murder", "nicholas", "tweeted", "huffpost", "white", "nationalist", "jews", "charged", "neonazi", "identifies", "twitter", "illness", "tied", "young", "disturbing", "teen", "mental", "heres", "gun"], "polarity": -0.03765458422174841, "subjectivity": 0.44691186922530185},

Atlanta Monster is a podcast that explores the disturbing and complicated case of Wayne Williams, the person a jury found guilty of what has come to be known as the \u201cAtlanta Child Murders.\u201d\n\nHosted by Payne Lindsey, a documentarian and amateur investigator whose earlier podcast Up and Vanished helped solve the cold case murder of Tara Grinstead in rural Georgia, this show explores the murders of these young boys while examining the culture of Atlanta in the early 1980s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile this is not a perfect podcast (I find it plodding at times, and for a detailed review, see Panama Jackson\u2019s discussion of it here), a few things have become clear: 1) There are more questions than answers about what happened to the boys who were murdered, and 2) since there are so many questions, many black folks in the city of Atlanta have developed theories in an attempt to make sense of it.\n\nSome say the Ku Klux Klan were the ones killing the kids; others, emboldened by homophobia, claim that a child sex ring is the reason they were murdered. Yet one thing is beyond dispute: Twenty-eight kids are dead, and many black people in Atlanta do not believe the official police report.\n\n\n\nThe number of theories about the case got me thinking about how black folks in America, faced with racism that is both systematic and ubiquitous, often do the best we can to make sense of the world by investing in theories that are, upon first examination, fantastical and yet, when examined in context, inherently logical.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor example, remember the Illuminati? People were convinced that Bey and Jay were members, prompting the Queen to say: \u201cY\u2019all haters corny with that illuminati mess.\u201d This theory is both fantastical yet logical. Instead of believing that Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z are, in fact, that brilliant and talented, the only way for some to make sense of their success in a country as racist as America is to believe that they are involved in the Illuminati.\n\nIt is illogical because, well, the Illuminati. But it does make sense for black folks who know what it is to struggle and fight for every dime to see that kind of meteoric come up and be suspicious. This way of thinking is not new. I became intimately acquainted with it when my uncle taught me about the White Man.\n\nUncle Johnny blamed everything on the Man. He said black folks had bad credit because the Man would not give us the same access to capital as he would white folks. He said that black unemployment was bad because the Man wanted black folks to be broke. Johnny was convinced that the white man flooded the black community with drugs to undermine the Black Panthers and that neighborhoods are segregated because the Man did not want \u201cniggas to live next do\u2019 and date his daughters.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the time, I found his conspiracy theories fantastical, but Uncle Johnny was convinced he was right. I now see that he wasn\u2019t wrong. History is clear on the fact that black folks were redlined and denied credit and that the FBI was involved in undermining and dismantling the Black Panther Party. To be black in America is to be a living, breathing, logical end of a conspiracy.\n\nSo while my uncle was incorrect in his assessment that there was a singular white man behind all of these social ills, he was right to think that there was something nefarious going on. According to the Oxford Dictionary, a conspiracy theory is \u201cthe theory that an event or phenomenon occurs as a result of a conspiracy between interested parties; specifically: a belief that some covert but influential agency (typically political in motivation and oppressive in intent) is responsible for an unexplained event.\u201d\n\n\n\nBlack folks are given to this way of thinking because our entire existence in this country is the result of a conspiracy. We were stolen from our homeland, brought to this country and treated like cattle, all while being taught that we were intellectually and aesthetically inferior. Then, when we created art, it was stolen, as Elvis took from Big Mama Thornton and Led Zeppelin took from Muddy Waters and Willie Dixon. Therefore, the black inclination to believe in conspiracy theories is a logical response to the unfathomable institutional oppression we\u2019ve faced since the first enslaved African stepped foot on America\u2019s shores.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause there are more questions than answers about what happened to the 28 black lives that were taken in Atlanta, I understand why conspiracy theories have developed in the presence of questionable justice. If the powerful in this country have a track record of disregarding black life, why should we believe them when they say they\u2019ve found someone who has taken it?\n\n", "keywords": ["folks", "theories", "conspires", "sense", "man", "white", "atlanta", "believe", "black", "country", "conspiracy", "easy"], "polarity": 0.01376062209395543, "subjectivity": 0.44569103735770393},

What makes this even more special is that Cardi is the first person to do it with her first five chart entries.\n\nI know my co-workers, my friends and everyone else around me is tired of hearing me talk about Cardi B. Last week or the week before, I pitched a post I wanted to write about Cardi B to my editor, Yesha Callahan, and your mama was dead-ass like, \u201cNo.\u201d So imagine the joy that went through my body when Corey Townsend, our weekend social editor, posted this news in Slack.\n\nI legit typed in all caps: \u201cME. I WANT TO WRITE THIS. CARDI B IS MY PRESIDENT.\u201d\n\nAnd so now I get to write the post that I pitched in the first place but Yesha turned down. It has a news peg and a new purpose.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy president got me out here winning.\n\nCardi\u2019s songs and features are holding the 1, 3, 4, 7, and 10 spots on the chart.\n\nIn the No. 1 spot is her feature on Bruno Mars\u2019 \u201cFinesse.\u201d This song is a bop. I love the \u201990s vibe and the homage to In Living Color in the video. Bruno Mars is dope as hell, but Cardi really makes this song for me. Plus, I like how she slowed her cadence down and enunciated every word so we understand clearly what she\u2019s saying.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis song moved from No. 16 to No. 1 in its first week. Recognize the talents of the performers. Put some respeck on their names. Don\u2019t @ me.\n\nThis is Cardi\u2019s second appearance in the No. 1 spot. \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d held that position for six weeks from September to October 2017.\n\nG-Eazy\u2019s \u201cNo Limit\u201d is holding down the No. 3, slipping from No. 2 this week. G-Eazy released this in September, capitalizing on the heat Cardi already had going with \u201cBodak Yellow.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCardi didn\u2019t just write a hot verse; she made this a hot song (again, don\u2019t @ me).\n\nI like G-Eazy enough, but I only noticed him because of this song with Cardi; before I heard this song, I had never heard of him.\n\nAnyway, I love this feature for Cardi. My favorite part is when she says, \u201cMy career taking off; these hos jogging in place.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYesssssssssss, Cardi. Do your thing, bitch.\n\n\u201cMotorsport\u201d by Migos is in the No. 4 spot and features Cardi B and Nicki Minaj locked in the most vicious tongue-twisting rhyme battle that ever happened in subs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have always maintained that Cardi was the best thing about this song, too. Nothing against Migos, but she brings all the energy to this song. Nicki is good, but as VSB\u2019s Panama Jackson said to me when we discussed it, she does what Nicki always does.\n\nCardi, however, comes extra hard. She\u2019s had her come up. It\u2019s still happening for her, and she wants to continue this ride for as long as possible. She brings her A game, and she gives us everything we want from her: sex, feminine bravado, fast rhymes that show us that Cardi B attitude, and a readiness to battle even Nicki Minaj to get that crown.\n\nAnd yes, she is the trap Selena, because we will do anything for Belcalis.\n\n\u201cBartier Cardi,\u201d Cardi\u2019s latest single from her forthcoming album, is in the No. 7 spot. It moved up from the No. 9 spot and features rapper 21 Savage. It\u2019s growing on me. It\u2019s basically \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d with a dude rapping on it, and that is what makes it work. It gives us something new to bop to from the same Cardi we already love. This is her formula, and it is working for her, so why change it up now?\n\n\u201cSay, little bitch, you can\u2019t fuck with me if you wanted to\u201d is a mood, a motto and an anthem. \u201cBodak Yellow,\u201d Cardi\u2019s first single, spent six weeks in the No. 1 spot and is now holding steady at No. 10.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI feel this song in my chest every time I hear it, because as Cardi relishes in her extreme come up, I, too, relate to her story.\n\nThis song is for anyone who has ever had a dream and worked hard to make it a reality with steady grinding.\n\nYou know what is the best part of all this?\n\nWe watched Cardi have a full fangirl moment when Beyonc\u00e9 took a picture with her at the Made in America Festival.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 seemed equally enthralled with Cardi, and the Queen laid hands on Cardi, and now look.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 had four hits in the top 10 at once before.

Conway eagerly answered, \u201cYes!\u201d before adding, \u201cThey can call me, by the way. They can call me.\u201d\n\nThat same publication is reporting that the team is so desperate to have star power that talent bookers say that they have been offered cash and in some cases ambassadorships in exchange for securing talent. One apparent insider explained, \u201cMy first thought was, \u2018Are you joking?' But no, it was serious.\u201d\n\nAnother was \u201cshocked\u201d at the proposal, noting, \u201cNever in a million years have I heard something so crazy. That was the moment I almost dropped the phone.\u201d\n\nIn response, committee spokesman Boris Epshteyn said in a statement:\n\n\n\nThere is no truth to this insinuation. First-class entertainers are eager to participate in the inaugural events. The inauguration as a whole will be an exciting and uniting celebration of freedom and democracy. We will be releasing further details at the appropriate time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are minuscule things that are constant in the seven-decade-spanning look at instability that is Donald Trump, but this one is true: The orange-skinned man loves to be around really famous people. Another: He is a damn liar. To that end, if Trump\u2019s transition committee is denying that they\u2019ve offered cash and ambassadorships in order to secure big-name singers, it\u2019s likely more true than it is false.\n\nHowever, not every talent booker or the talent themselves will operate with ethical codes similar to those The Wrap spoke to. So, to any entertainer considering performing at Trump\u2019s inauguration and de facto Klan rally, you best be careful of the consequences. This is especially true if you are black or an artist who dabbles heavily in black art forms.\n\nEarlier this month, Ne-Yo was asked by TMZ if he would perform at Trump\u2019s inauguration and said he would. \"I wouldn't go because I support Donald Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cI'd go because it's a dope party.\" Social media backlash immediately ensued, leaving the singer-songwriter to go to Instagram to declare that some people just couldn\u2019t take a joke.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you watch the clip in question, though, Ne-Yo first answered yes and was then told that his answer was different from Jamie Foxx\u2019s (who said he would not go). Ne-Yo went on to explain why he would do it. You know, \u201c\u2019cause a dope party is a dope party.\u201d But ha-ha-ha or whatever.\n\nNe-Yo learned his lesson fast all the same. It\u2019s one that other artists who swim around the same pop and R&B pools should heed as well. As much as I enjoy Bruno Mars, Puerto Rican Frankie Lymon better not go doo-wop-pop-pop and shimmy for Bankruptcy Batista. Likewise, Justin Timberlake better take the invitation to call Conway about putting on a suit and tie for Minute Maid Mao and set it on fire. I dare the man who turned on Janet Jackson to insult black people to such a degree again.\n\nIf the fear of offending a diverse public bothered by the tangerine demagogue is not enough to say no, then one can also learn from the mistake made by Destiny\u2019s Child. Back in 2001, the group performed at George W. Bush\u2019s inauguration. Five years later, Beyonc\u00e9 was asked about her choice and whether it meant that she was a Republican. She said that she was not.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe went on to explain: \"I played at the inauguration because there were a lot of kids in the audience that I wanted to reach, that's all. Maybe one day I will speak of my political beliefs, but only when I know what I'm talking about.\"\n\nAs you can tell from the past election, the imagery in her work and her past performances, her views are now clear. Yet, in time, black people came to understand just how little regard Bush had for black people. To be fair, Bush at least put on airs as president-elect that he was a different kind of conservative and harbored no ill will toward black people and other racial minorities.\n\nWhen it comes to our next president, though, how he feels about blacks, Latinos, Muslims, women and the LGBTQ community is all quite clear. He doesn\u2019t deserve a big bash full of the ultrafamous and extraordinarily talented. He deserves the has-beens and never-really-had-its. To celebrate him and perform before him is to endorse his bigotry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is a choice, one that warrants whatever consequences come as a result of it.\n\nStephen A.

While I was too young and too far away at the time to be directly affected by the Atlanta Child Murders\u2014a name given to the rash of murders of black children from many of Atlanta\u2019s impoverished communities from 1979 to 1981\u2014the era, subsequent search for, and eventual prosecution and conviction of Williams marked a very dark spot on the city.\n\nThe case involved disenfranchised black communities, the Ku Klux Klan, potential race wars, the Mayor\u2019s Office, the Atlanta Police Department, the FBI, the Chattahoochee River, Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jr., James Baldwin and even a 1985 CBS miniseries called The Atlanta Child Murders, which included stars like James Earl Jones and Ruby Dee, as well as Morgan Freeman, which just proves that where there is blackness, there is Morgan Freeman.\n\nEven some of Atlanta\u2019s hip-hop acts have woven the tales into their rhymes, with lines like, \u201c ... the only thing we feared was Williams, Wayne ... ,\u201d courtesy of Andr\u00e9 3000 on Goodie Mob\u2019s standout \u201cThought Process\u201d from their debut album, Soul Food, and again on their follow-up album, Still Standing\u2019s \u201cGutta Butta,\u201d this time courtesy of Khujo Goodie, where he states, \u201c ... and they know where to dump that ass, in the Cha-ttahootchee River with the rest of the kids ... ,\u201d a nod to the fact that several of the bodies of missing children, as well as those of two adult men, which ultimately brought down Wayne Williams, were found in the river.\n\nThe case of Williams and the Atlanta Child Murders has been the subject of books, essays and documentaries. Aside from the aforementioned miniseries, Soledad O\u2019Brien also did a deep dive into the case for CNN.\n\nAs a case, it\u2019s fascinating because so many actually believe that Williams is innocent, including family members of some of the murdered children, who think that Williams was used to cover up the true murderer, who might have been a white person or persons who could have torn the city apart at the seams.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf he was (or is) innocent, Williams did himself no favors, having failed several polygraphs and fabricating information given to the police. Also, circumstantial DNA evidence makes him responsible for at least the two adult cases, and he was tied to many of the child cases, though not all.\n\nNow, courtesy of HowStuffWorks and Tenderfoot TV, comes the podcast Atlanta Monster, hosted by Payne Lindsey. The podcast is a several-weeks-long podcast that takes the deep-dive, investigative journalistic approach to looking at the case. The podcast rehashes familiar information, but with new looks and interviews with people connected to the case and from locals in Atlanta who were children at that time.\n\nIt\u2019s two episodes in, and to call it riveting would be underselling it tremendously.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s also triggering. The entire story is about the deaths of almost 30 children; black children from some of Atlanta\u2019s poorest and most vulnerable communities. There were mothers and fathers and brothers and sisters separated from their kids and siblings. Grandmothers who sent their grandchildren to the store and never saw them again.\n\nAs a parent, I find the thought of losing a child nightmarish. Like this? Lord. I cannot imagine being a parent who had to watch the news, only to find out that another child was found dead, knowing that one\u2019s own child was missing, and sitting with evaporating hope and prayer each day. That must be one of the most harrowing experiences ever.\n\nWhile it is a case that was closed more than 30 years ago and is largely unspoken of\u2014especially in Atlanta\u2014the idea of vulnerable children being at the heart of it can make the story hard to listen to.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor many adults in Atlanta who were children at the time of the child murders, after Williams was caught, he was akin to a bogeyman. I\u2019ve heard him referenced as, \u201cBe careful or Wayne Williams will get you.\u201d While the podcast is two episodes in, I can tell it will go there, considering that locals from Atlanta\u2019s west side are enlisted to recount the history.\n\nThat\u2019s one thing about this podcast so far that\u2019s interesting to listen to: Most documentaries I\u2019ve seen talk to family and law enforcement, but this includes actual Atlantans who grew up during the time, and not just politicians, but regular folks living in the city. We get to hear how it felt during that time.\n\nI\u2019m not the biggest podcast person, but this is one worth listening to because it revisits a case that captured national attention, and gripped a city, particularly the black citizens, while the white citizens were largely ambivalent. And then, once a person was convicted, the city pretended that it never happened.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExcept it did happen; the city of Atlanta lost a significant number of its youths because nobody took the case seriously for almost a year because we were talking about black children. In episode 2, it\u2019s mentioned that during the terror, a fake call came in to authorities, threatening to kill a white child, and how that heightened some tensions. It\u2019s like A Time to Kill all over again.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a podcast to check out, this might be your bag, baby. Even though we know how it ends\u2014at least those of us familiar with the case\u2014the new information and rehashing of a case that affected so many families so like many of ours is worth the listen to hear how a community dealt with the loss of its youths. And how it\u2019s tried to move on.", "keywords": ["monster", "williams", "child", "murders", "listening", "atlanta", "children", "wayne", "black", "podcast", "city", "case"], "polarity": 0.10534324194324195, "subjectivity": 0.4692494986494988},

Black women showed up and showed out in various ways. Black men put their careers and livelihoods on the line to speak out against racial injustice, police violence, and sexual assault and harassment. Creative artists experienced amazing glow ups, and black teenagers all over the country showed that no matter what, still we rise. Let\u2019s take a look at some of the biggest winners of 2017.\n\nBlack Activism\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a year that began with us getting the worst president in the world, black activists continued to do the work to help black people stay alive and get free. That activism took on many forms\u2014from protests both loud and silent to creative arts projects to writing\u2014and it was prolific in the year 2017.\n\nBlack people fought and continued to fight for clean water for the people of Flint, Mich., as well as other cities; social justice; economic justice; and an end to the state-sanctioned murder of black people at the hands of police. These fights are not over, and if 2017 was any indication, our voices will only get louder in 2018.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeyonc\u00e9\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 broke the internet in February when she announced that she was pregnant with twins via an Instagram post, and her year went on an upswing that has not ended. Although we know she has plenty of haters, it\u2019s hard to understand how you can hate on someone so graceful, so beautiful, so talented and so free in her own black womanhood. Her pregnancy led to the birth of beautiful twins\u2014 which she has blessed us with time and time again. Oh, and Sir and Rumi were cute, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer charity and generosity are not always made public, but she gives from the heart when it matters most. Not to mention, her after-pregnancy snapback was real and an inspiration to us all. Deep down inside, she is just a \u201cTexas bama\u201d who has her fangirl moments just like the rest of us, and we are here for it. Long live Queen Bey.\n\nFenty Beauty\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe all have our own favorite makeup brands, but when Rihanna announced that she would be launching Fenty Beauty in September, black girls (and the rest of y\u2019all) went crazy. No, she didn\u2019t make it just for us, but she made it for us in that she kept black girls in mind when creating the color ranges. The products flew off the shelves faster than they could be stocked.\n\nFenty had other beauty lines shook time and time again because Fenty had the range. Just one month in, Fenty had $72 million in earned media value, showing us that the combination of Black Girl Magic and black-girl social media capital is a guaranteed win. Right on, Fenty. Right on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack High School Seniors Accepted to College\n\nDespite being told by America every single day that their lives don\u2019t matter, black students continued to push forward and show that yes, the hell they do. Even as people tried to call them underachievers and say they are destined to a life of nothingness, black kids stood up and loudly proclaimed, \u201cYes, we can!\u201d Whether they were getting accepted to all eight Ivy League schools, heading off to Harvard or fulfilling their dream of going to their favorite HBCU, black high school seniors did the damn thing in 2017, and we are proud of y\u2019all. Keep pushing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCardi B\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe don\u2019t dance no more, she makes money moves. If you look up the phrase \u201cglow up\u201d in the dictionary, right after the definition of the new vertical on The Root, there will be a picture of Cardi B, her tongue hanging out and the look of win on her face, because she seriously glowed up in 2017. Regardless of how you may feel about her, your hate and a Grammy snub won\u2019t stop her shine. She signed big deals, had one of the biggest hits of the year (my current theme song/anthem), got big props from the Queen herself\u2014and despite rumors of a potential breakup, her boo Offset proposed to her with an 8-carat diamond ring. Cardi did 2017 big as hell, and we can only expect that will continue in 2018.\n\nTerry Crews\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt takes a black man who is strong in will and mind to display restraint and not beat the shit out of a perverted white man who gropes his genitals in full view of everyone at a Hollywood party. It takes an even stronger black man to come forward during the #MeToo storm and admit that he, too, was sexually violated by a powerful white man in Hollywood. That strong black man was Terry Crews.\n\nWhile some questioned why he didn\u2019t just pummel Adam Venit when the Hollywood power broker allegedly grabbed his genitals at a party, Crews showed that it\u2019s a game of chess, not checkers, and in the end, the sound mind wins. He filed a police report, filed a lawsuit and spoke out against sexual assault in Hollywood, letting everyone know that he would not be a victim. He was named one of Time magazine\u2019s \u201csilence breakers.\u201d He dropped WME\u2014the agency Venit worked for that basically did nothing to protect Crews and everything to protect Venit\u2014and moved on to new representation, all without being the stereotypical angry black man that everyone wanted or expected him to be.\n\nThat is the very definition of winning. Kudos, Terry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBarack Obama\n\nBarack Obama won 2017 the day he left office as the president of the United States. I am very sure it was like when Scarface quit his job in Half Baked.\n\nOur president started wearing less and going out more. He sent his wife a cute Valentine\u2019s Day tweet. He got crowds and applause just for being a regular-ass dude. People wanted so much more of him, the bidding war over his memoirs reached $60 million. He received the 2017 JFK Profile in Courage Award. He even reported for jury duty in Chicago. He basically showed everyone that leaving the presidency hasn\u2019t stopped his shine or his charisma, and your orange-colored Oompa Loompa of a president could never. Come through, Barack. Come through.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nColin Kaepernick\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNFL ratings are down, and league officials don\u2019t know what to do about it. Good. The NFL deserves whatever \u201cL\u2019s\u201d it gets because the NFL turned its back on Colin Kaepernick. Meanwhile, Kaepernick continues to shine. When he started his silent protests during the national anthem last year, he was widely criticized by people who didn\u2019t understand his need and desire to fight for black lives or the recognition he got for it. None of that matters. Despite it all, Kaepernick is living his best life. He has gotten award after award, and he is even considering buying an NFL team. Take that, NFL. Long live Colin Kaepernick.\n\nBlack Women\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2017 was the year of the black woman. From your Auntie Maxine Waters to Serena Williams winning the Australian Open while pregnant to Karen Bass\u2019 hilarious takedown of Jeff Sessions to black women showing up to guarantee Roy Moore did not win in Alabama to Tarana Burke and the #MeToo movement, black women were here for you. Black women have always been here for you. Black women will continue to be here for you. Now black women need you to be here for us.

While watching it, I had a bunch of thoughts, mostly nostalgic\n\n1. It's been 13 years since I've lived in Atlanta. At this point, I've lived in Washington, DC, longer than I've lived anywhere else in life. It is home for me and I feel more connected to DC than any other place I've lived. But Atlanta is in my heart. Watching the Rock Doc (heretofore rerferred to as ATL Rise) had me feeling a lot of pride and feeling somewhat homesick. I was in ATL last week for a day visiting my sister who lives in the western outskirts. It takes almost 30 minutes to drive from her home into my old neighborhood on the West side of the city. In order to get to my parents home in Alabama, I don't have to to drive through downtown or ever see the skyline. I can just be in Georgia. However, as I prepared for my daugher and I to drive back to my parents home, I was overcome with this need to drive thru downtown because I couldn't be in Atlanta and not see the buildings and the skyline and feel like I was in Atlanta. I just couldn't. I HAD to do it. I miss Atlanta is the point here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. I was too young to remember the time when Wayne Williams was terrorizing the city. But I as I got older, I remember Wayne Williams. I thought it was interesting, but not surprising they included him into the discussion fo ATL hiphop. He's been mentioned by countless ATL rappers, but he was immortalized by this Andre 3000 quote, \"\u2026nobody would die in cops and robbers when we used to play right/the only thing we feared was Williams, Wayne\u2026\" on \"Thought Process\" from Goodie Mob's first album Soul Food.\n\n3. I hate Kilo Ali. Like hate with the passion of 1,000 sharks at a blood bank. This hatred is personal. See\u2026and how do I put this without incriminating anybody\u2026\n\n\u2026a guy whose named rhymes with Below Bali shot my cousin in the leg. My cousin is alive so I ain't just snitch. Plus statute of limitations. But I'm saying, that Bowen Homes life is real and fuck Kilo Ali.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. I grew up in Germany so our summers were spent back in the US and those summers in the late 80s and early 90s in ATL were when the city was on the rise and being documented in ATL Rise.With that being said, I vividly remember hearing Kilo Ali's \"Cocaine (America Has A Problem)\" for the first time and loving it. Anyway, I had to be like 11 when I heard that song. They used to show scenes from MBK (a teen club on Campbellton Rd) on television at night, I want to say, before Arsenio Hall came on. We had this tiny ass television in the smaller bedroom occupied by a rotating number of cousins in my grandmother's 2-BR duplex on the West side of Atlanta. Anyway, I remember hearing that song and being like, \"wow\u2026who is this dude!!!\" Then\u2026see #3.\n\n5. It was interesting hearing the opinions of those so heavily invested in the music scene and their feelings about how ATL wasn't getting respect on the hip-hop scene. It's all obviously true, I just think I was too young to care back in the early 90s. I remember listening to the \"Bankhead Bounce\" and songs from Hitman Sammy Sam and Raheem The Dream and be like, yay ATL. I wasn't a hip-hop head at the point so I didn't really view any of it as being that important. Until Outkast. The way they teased Outkast in the documentary was very necessary. When Outkast hit, we all felt a change. For one, that \"Player's Ball\" video was so authentic and southern. It felt like Atlanta. It looked like Atlanta. It was genuine. That is when I really started paying attention. I'll add another anecdote in another bullet about Outkast.\n\n6. Lightskint Chris from Kriss Kross is somebody I knew when I was younger. Not well. But his cousin stayed a few doors down from my grandmother so he used to always be at his cousins's house. Now his cousin was a good friend of mine and he had a crush on one of my sisters so of course we were cool. Anyway, I remember LSC from those days then one day, hearing from his cousin that he had blown up. Then saw him on TV and was like\u2026wow. In the doc they were like, Kriss Kross made everybody feeel like they could make it. That was very true. Seeing somebody I knew, only briefly, make it was definitely one of those, \"if they can do it, anybody can do it\" moments. Also, its a shame that they blew up as pop acts because they're later work was more them. Thems was some niggas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. In high school, I had a friend named Corey who had an older brother named Nan (short for Fernandes - RIP Nan). Now, I have no idea how he got it, but Nan had some LaFace sampler that had half of Goodie Mob's Soul Food album on it at least 6 months before that thing came out. Of course, none of us knew this. Nan hated the tape so he gave it to me and I blasted that thing. I had no idea what I had in my possesion. Goodie Mob didn't get much airplay on the documentary, but while the nation loved Outkast (as did ATL, of course) a LOT of folks were REALLY lovin' Goodie Mob and that Soul Food album. It was angry. It was smart. It sounded like music from a bunch of kids who were just trying to find a way out. \"Git Up, Git Out\" sounded like way more of a Goodie Mob song than an Outkast song. Point of it all, I was up on Goodie Mob for a looooong time before the rest of the South was. I'm bragging.\n\n8. T.I. sounds like the West side of Atlanta. Outkast sounds like Atlanta. Goodie Mob definitely sounds like Southwest Atlanta to me. T.I.??? That is a West side nigga all day. I remember some years back when Shawty Lo (Bowen Homes representative, Zone 1) tried to claim that T.I. wasn't really from Bankhead but was from Riverdale. And yes, he may have gone to high school for some time in Riverdale, but that nigga is Zone 1, Center Hill all day. All. Day. When I want to remind myself of what the West Side of Atlanta feels like (Adamsville, Zone 4, MLK4Lyfe), I throw in T.I. Any of it will do. I particularly love the King album. But Urban Legend was a spectacular painting of what life as a West side dopeboy feels like.\n\n9. Amazingly, an hour and a half was way too short. It took them an hour to get to Outkast. They could really have done another 2 hours on ATL and still not covered it all. Oh, and it was good to see Jermaine Dupri get some credit. I feel like he's one of the most underrated producers in the game ever. Probably because he lives in the pop realm. But he's responsible for a lot. He put on for ATL in a major way. Same with Dallas Austin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. But Organized Noize will forever be where my hip-hop heart lies. They put on for ATL in such a spectacular fashion that their influence may never not be felt in the fabric of ATL hiphop. I know most folks harken back to 'Kast's Southernplayalisticcadillacmuzik as their favorite album, but ATLiens is what did it for me. And specifically, \"Elevators (Me & You)\". I remember where I was the first time I heard it. It changed my life. That song opened me up and I haven't been the same since. Now that song was produced by Andre, Big Boi, and Mr. DJ (they are known as Earthtone III), but there is no Earthtone III without Organized Noize and thus no \"Elevators\". And I'm not sure where my life would have been without it. I'd probably be in jail. Or dead.

Maxine Waters: Breaker of Chains, Reclaimer of Time\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter having to suffer the devastating dishonor of having an orange buffoon in the White House, black people have pretty much been fed up since before 2017. And no person illustrated this \u201cfed-uppedness\u201d more than longtime career politician Rep. Maxine Waters.\n\n\n\nMadame Waters (D-Calif.) was, quite frankly, the mood of 2017. From her hilarious and biting tweets to her determination to see Donald Trump impeached, she simply had no fucks to give. And the greatest example of this was when her legitimate question about 45\u2019s financial ties to Russia was interrupted by wayward Caucasian American Steven Mnuchin. The deflection did not deter her and she instead repeated \u201cReclaiming my time\u201d over and over again until he eventually shut the fuck up.\n\nShe\u2019s a boss. You know it. I know it. And 2017 knew it.\n\n2. Michelle Obama and the Side Eye Seen\u2019t Around the World\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMuch despair was felt through the force when it was announced that Agent Orange was gonna waltz his baked-Cheeto, dusty ass into the White House. And while that was bad enough, most of us couldn\u2019t stop thinking about how little time we had left to spend with the Obamas. So imagine our surprise when Michelle Obama gifted us with enough side eye during Inauguration Day to help us power through the rest of 2017.\n\nYes, before she would walk into the sunset with her beloved Barack and say goodbye to us forever, our good sis Michelle gave the best side eye ever after getting a gift from Melania and listening to all the Inauguration Day malarkey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was her final act as first lady. And what an act it was.\n\n3. Anika Noni Rose Lovingly Encouraging Cicely Tyson at the Emmys\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have a love-hate relationship with the Emmys, mostly based on how Caucasian the nomination lineups are for the night. However, I luckily caught a few moments from the 2017 Emmys. And I\u2019m glad I did because had I not, I would have missed one of the greatest moments in Black Girl Magic history.\n\n\n\nThe moment includes both Anika Noni Rose and Cicely Tyson going up to announce the winner for Outstanding Limited Series. The immortal Tyson paused right before recalling her role in Roots, and instead of awkwardly standing there until Tyson remembered, Rose leaned over and whispered an encouragement in Tyson\u2019s ears.\n\n\n\nIt was one of the simplest yet greatest acts of black sisterhood and solidarity that I had seen in a while. And in a year that was as brutal as 2017, it was sorely needed.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. World Stop: Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Pregnancy Announcement\n\nGreatness begets greatness. I don\u2019t know who said that, and I don\u2019t care to ask, but just know that it has been and always will be applied to Her Majesty King Beyonc\u00e9, First and Only of Her Name.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter having a fantastic year in 2016, Beyonc\u00e9 blew our black minds when she surprise-announced her pregnancy on Instagram with the radiance and grace of a black Madonna. And while gracing us with her otherworldliness, she managed to piss off white women and white conservatives and inspire low-budget Great Value copycats in one wild swoop.\n\nNever change, Bey. Never change.\n\n5. Black Twitter Gathering Kendall Jenner\u2019s Edges Over That Pepsi Commercial\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlenty of black folx had a fantastic year. Cardi B had a fantastic year. Issa Rae had a phenomenal year. Rihanna had a spectacular year. New Edition had an amazing year. And Tiffany Haddish had an astounding year.\n\n\n\nThe list of black people laughing in the face of 2017 is very long. But such a list would be incomplete without the collective that is Black Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack Twitter has been a respected entity for a while now. But it truly cemented itself as a cultural force for change when it single-handedly got Kendall Jenner\u2019s tone-deaf-ass Pepsi commercial yoinked from the TV airwaves. Indeed, Jenner thought she was doing all of us a favor by throwing some dusty Party City wig at a fellow sista in the commercial (an apt self-dragging of white feminism) before hijacking black and brown traditions of protest, and Black Twitter, of course, said, \u201cNot today, Satan.\u201d\n\n\n\nCombine this with other cultural moments like spurring on (along with Black Tumblr) Netflix to make that Rihanna-Lupita Nyong\u2019o Heist movie, penned by Issa Rae and directed by Ava DuVernay, a reality and exposing the hell out of Keaton Jones\u2019 white supremacist family, and it is very clear that Black Twitter is here to stay and suffers no fools.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. Black Women in Alabama Telling Roy Moore, \u201cYou Thought!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou probably notice how I keep mentioning that 2017 was a tough-ass year. This is most certainly true, especially politically.\n\nSince the Over-Inflated Tangerine was voted into office by white women, it\u2019s been a yearlong battle to make sure that our legislators, quite frankly, do not kill us. This has been true concerning the Affordable Care Act, the GOP tax plan, net neutrality and so much more. So you can say, politically, we really needed a win.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd black women gave us exactly that in the election battle between Roy Moore and Doug Jones for a U.S. Senate seat representing Alabama.\n\nThe choice was between an accused child-molesting, homophobic bigot and a Democrat, Doug Jones, and white people almost purposely screwed the pooch again by voting in the alleged child molester because he was \u201ccloser to God\u201d (cue an eye roll). Of course, black women did not allow this to pass.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was a nod to the 94 percent who showed us they had common sense during the general election, and it proved that, yes, even states like Alabama (where black people live, too, Bernie Sanders) can have competitive elections if given the fucking chance.\n\nBlack women, I salute you. Truly.\n\n7. It Ain\u2019t Over Till It\u2019s Over: Moonlight\n\nIn that same vein, 2017 must have been the year of \u201cHold up, wait a minute,\u201d because not only did black people pull off the upset in Alabama this year, but we managed to pull it off during Oscar season, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarlier this year, La La Land was heavily projected to win the Oscar for Best Picture over Moonlight, and despite all the queer black people everywhere giving Goku our energy for a spirit bomb, it looked like La La Land would indeed win. And that much was confirmed when B(La)h B(La)h Land was crowned winner.\n\nThat is ... until it was un-crowned.\n\nIn one of the most confusing moments of 2017, La La Land producer Jordan Horowitz snatched the card from the dazed and confused presenter and clarified that it was Moonlight that had actually won Best Picture. I\u2019m always gonna wonder who I need to drag for low-key stealing Moonlight\u2019s moment, but this should be a lesson to us as a people that it is not over until we say it\u2019s over.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. Colin Kaepernick Has the Last Laugh\n\nColin Kaepernick\u2019s long, hard-fought battle to call out police brutality and systemic injustice started out in 2016 when he, a San Francisco 49ers quarterback at the time, sat down during the playing of the national anthem at a preseason game versus the Green Bay Packers.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince then, the football player and activist has been the center of an intense, national debate on racial and social injustice, and because he continued to walk and talk the talk, the powers that be decided that Kaepernick would enter the year as an unsigned free agent, despite being more talented than plenty of other current quarterbacks (*stares at Jay Cutler*).\n\n\n\nAnd these racist NFL owners probably had a good chuckle over it all ... until it was announced that Kaepernick was suing the shit out of all of them, of course.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot only did Kaepernick decide to bring a case against them, but he also went on to become GQ\u2019s Citizen of the Year, and he\u2019s currently mulling over the prospect of maybe owning the Carolina Panthers alongside Diddy and Steph Curry.\n\nClearly, Kaepernick is just getting started.\n\n9. Black People Do Do Horror: On Get Out Being a Success\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn times of trial and tribulation, black art has risen like a phoenix and thrived in the face of uncertainty, and Get Out was certainly not an exception this year.\n\n\n\nJordan Peele\u2019s directorial debut and smash hit changed the game forever this year.\n\nNot only did it make bank with a film budget that sounded like the movie-producing equivalent of $3, but its biting social commentary on racial relations in America presented in the horror genre reminded us of how multifaceted black people are and how it\u2019s about damn time that black creatives get to flex our muscles in genre movies (another great example of this is Dee Rees\u2019 Mudbound, which no doubt counts as a Western/period piece).\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd not even the Golden Globes\u2019 outdated genre system can take this win away from us.\n\n10. LeBron James Calling Donald Trump by His Name: \u201cBum\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the year when white people continued to show their asses and black people made a conscious and collective decision to stop giving a singular fuck, no such person illustrated this big mood quite like LeBron R. James.\n\nJames, a three-time NBA champ, has proved time and time again that he doesn\u2019t concern himself with the opinions of sheep, but he took this attitude to the next level when the Expired Squash got in his Twitter feelings about Steph Curry and the Golden State Warriors\u2019 declining his booty-ass invite to visit the White (Supremacist) House.\n\nTrump was about five more seconds from going full Mean Girls on Curry (which included uninviting them) when James became sick of the bullshit and fired off the tweet heard around the world:\n\nHe called 45 a \u201cbum.\u201d\n\nThe legendary tweet is still on James\u2019 Twitter page. To this day. And I am hoping that it continues to serve as a visible reminder that black people from all walks of life are never too busy to speak truth to power and call a spade a spade. All while having a good and necessary laugh.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd that\u2019s that on that.", "keywords": ["2017", "won", "land", "women", "white", "moments", "kaepernick", "tyson", "black", "twitter", "la"], "polarity": 0.10843534659042689, "subjectivity": 0.4960628438703303},

Black women showed up and showed out in various ways. Black men put their careers and livelihoods on the line to speak out against racial injustice, police violence, and sexual assault and harassment. Creative artists experienced amazing glow ups, and black teenagers all over the country showed that no matter what, still we rise. Let\u2019s take a look at some of the biggest winners of 2017.\n\nBlack Activism\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a year that began with us getting the worst president in the world, black activists continued to do the work to help black people stay alive and get free. That activism took on many forms\u2014from protests both loud and silent to creative arts projects to writing\u2014and it was prolific in the year 2017.\n\nBlack people fought and continued to fight for clean water for the people of Flint, Mich., as well as other cities; social justice; economic justice; and an end to the state-sanctioned murder of black people at the hands of police. These fights are not over, and if 2017 was any indication, our voices will only get louder in 2018.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeyonc\u00e9\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 broke the internet in February when she announced that she was pregnant with twins via an Instagram post, and her year went on an upswing that has not ended. Although we know she has plenty of haters, it\u2019s hard to understand how you can hate on someone so graceful, so beautiful, so talented and so free in her own black womanhood. Her pregnancy led to the birth of beautiful twins\u2014 which she has blessed us with time and time again. Oh, and Sir and Rumi were cute, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer charity and generosity are not always made public, but she gives from the heart when it matters most. Not to mention, her after-pregnancy snapback was real and an inspiration to us all. Deep down inside, she is just a \u201cTexas bama\u201d who has her fangirl moments just like the rest of us, and we are here for it. Long live Queen Bey.\n\nFenty Beauty\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe all have our own favorite makeup brands, but when Rihanna announced that she would be launching Fenty Beauty in September, black girls (and the rest of y\u2019all) went crazy. No, she didn\u2019t make it just for us, but she made it for us in that she kept black girls in mind when creating the color ranges. The products flew off the shelves faster than they could be stocked.\n\nFenty had other beauty lines shook time and time again because Fenty had the range. Just one month in, Fenty had $72 million in earned media value, showing us that the combination of Black Girl Magic and black-girl social media capital is a guaranteed win. Right on, Fenty. Right on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack High School Seniors Accepted to College\n\nDespite being told by America every single day that their lives don\u2019t matter, black students continued to push forward and show that yes, the hell they do. Even as people tried to call them underachievers and say they are destined to a life of nothingness, black kids stood up and loudly proclaimed, \u201cYes, we can!\u201d Whether they were getting accepted to all eight Ivy League schools, heading off to Harvard or fulfilling their dream of going to their favorite HBCU, black high school seniors did the damn thing in 2017, and we are proud of y\u2019all. Keep pushing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCardi B\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe don\u2019t dance no more, she makes money moves. If you look up the phrase \u201cglow up\u201d in the dictionary, right after the definition of the new vertical on The Root, there will be a picture of Cardi B, her tongue hanging out and the look of win on her face, because she seriously glowed up in 2017. Regardless of how you may feel about her, your hate and a Grammy snub won\u2019t stop her shine. She signed big deals, had one of the biggest hits of the year (my current theme song/anthem), got big props from the Queen herself\u2014and despite rumors of a potential breakup, her boo Offset proposed to her with an 8-carat diamond ring. Cardi did 2017 big as hell, and we can only expect that will continue in 2018.\n\nTerry Crews\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt takes a black man who is strong in will and mind to display restraint and not beat the shit out of a perverted white man who gropes his genitals in full view of everyone at a Hollywood party. It takes an even stronger black man to come forward during the #MeToo storm and admit that he, too, was sexually violated by a powerful white man in Hollywood. That strong black man was Terry Crews.\n\nWhile some questioned why he didn\u2019t just pummel Adam Venit when the Hollywood power broker allegedly grabbed his genitals at a party, Crews showed that it\u2019s a game of chess, not checkers, and in the end, the sound mind wins. He filed a police report, filed a lawsuit and spoke out against sexual assault in Hollywood, letting everyone know that he would not be a victim. He was named one of Time magazine\u2019s \u201csilence breakers.\u201d He dropped WME\u2014the agency Venit worked for that basically did nothing to protect Crews and everything to protect Venit\u2014and moved on to new representation, all without being the stereotypical angry black man that everyone wanted or expected him to be.\n\nThat is the very definition of winning. Kudos, Terry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBarack Obama\n\nBarack Obama won 2017 the day he left office as the president of the United States. I am very sure it was like when Scarface quit his job in Half Baked.\n\nOur president started wearing less and going out more. He sent his wife a cute Valentine\u2019s Day tweet. He got crowds and applause just for being a regular-ass dude. People wanted so much more of him, the bidding war over his memoirs reached $60 million. He received the 2017 JFK Profile in Courage Award. He even reported for jury duty in Chicago. He basically showed everyone that leaving the presidency hasn\u2019t stopped his shine or his charisma, and your orange-colored Oompa Loompa of a president could never. Come through, Barack. Come through.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nColin Kaepernick\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNFL ratings are down, and league officials don\u2019t know what to do about it. Good. The NFL deserves whatever \u201cL\u2019s\u201d it gets because the NFL turned its back on Colin Kaepernick. Meanwhile, Kaepernick continues to shine. When he started his silent protests during the national anthem last year, he was widely criticized by people who didn\u2019t understand his need and desire to fight for black lives or the recognition he got for it. None of that matters. Despite it all, Kaepernick is living his best life. He has gotten award after award, and he is even considering buying an NFL team. Take that, NFL. Long live Colin Kaepernick.\n\nBlack Women\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2017 was the year of the black woman. From your Auntie Maxine Waters to Serena Williams winning the Australian Open while pregnant to Karen Bass\u2019 hilarious takedown of Jeff Sessions to black women showing up to guarantee Roy Moore did not win in Alabama to Tarana Burke and the #MeToo movement, black women were here for you.

Even with his problematic campaign, he was one of the good ones. He would remember what black voters did for him. How could he not recognize that the only reason he is now referred to as \u201cSen. Doug Jones from the state of Alabama\u201d is the black vote? After all, he\u2019s a Democrat. How could he forget who put him there?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn return, Doug Jones and the Democratic Party, once again, have thrown black people to the wolves.\n\nPolitico magazine reports that on Wednesday, the Senate passed a bank-deregulation bill that rolls back many of the regulations imposed on banks and lenders. The bill passed with the support of the Trump administration, Republican senators and 17 Democratic senators\u2014most of whom are considered to be moderate or conservative Dems. The legislation now moves to the House of Representatives, where it is expected to pass.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor more than a decade I have been trying to push the idea that blackness has evolved past its murky racial and cultural definition. As a college macroeconomics instructor, I taught a class, Race as an Economic Construct, that advocated examining race through the lens of data and numbers. (The science of economics is not limited to the production and distribution of goods, services and wealth.)\n\nOne of the easiest ways to illustrate this point is with the history of black homeownership. Homeownership is the biggest builder of wealth in America and is still affected by the history of segregation, Jim Crow and redlining. It fuels every indicator of discrimination in this country and is one of the best examples of the manifestation of white supremacy.\n\nHousing discrimination relegated African Americans to homogeneous, poor black communities with underfunded, segregated schools. Poorer schools create the education gap. The education gap creates employment disparities. Underemployment creates poverty and the phenomenon called \u201cblack-on-black crime.\u201d Poverty leads to the inability to acquire affordable housing, which relegates black people to low-income communities, which leads to underfunded schools, which leads to more crime and so on. It is a vicious circle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is all about homeownership.\n\nWe have always known this. The Root has routinely reported on the difficulties black people encounter when buying a home. A recent report by the Center for Investigative Reporting, along with Reveal News, uncovered how U.S. banks systematically prevent blacks and Hispanics from becoming homeowners.\n\nJPMorgan Chase paid $55 million in January to settle charges that it discriminated against black and Latino borrowers. In 2011, Bank of America handed over $335 million for making its minority customers pay more than its white customers for the same loans. A federal lawsuit against Wells Fargo alleges that the bank has discriminated against Philadelphia\u2019s black and Latino borrowers since 2004.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is an indisputable fact that many banks treat their black customers unequally. The only reason we know this is that banks are required to report demographic data on most mortgage loans. That data is publicly available to anyone who wants to look at it.\n\nAmong other things, the legislation passed by the Senate on Wednesday strips away for some banks the requirement to report the race, ethnicity and gender of their mortgage customers. Under the new proposal, only the largest banks will have to report demographic data, which means that it will be impossible to find out if the other banks discriminate. If the law passes, these banks will be able to deny black customers without fear of repercussion or lawsuits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Democratic Party could have singled out that provision to the public and made a fuss. They could have called it racist (because it is racist), which would have made the legislation lose support. They could easily have refused to vote for this bill unless that specific provision was stripped away.\n\nSen. Doug Jones from the state of Alabama voted for it.\n\nThis is the Democratic Party.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: The Democratic Party is only a viable party because of the black vote. In the 2016 election, 88 percent of blacks voted for the Democratic candidate, while only 37 percent of whites voted for Hillary Clinton, according to exit polls by USA Today. Even before the most recent election, according to Pew Research, only 40 percent of whites identified as Democrats.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf not for black voters, there would not be a Democratic Party. Without the black vote, Dems would lose every election at the local, state and national levels. The Democratic Party\u2019s leadership knows this. The Republican Party knows this.\n\nYet Democratic politicians repeatedly refuse to stand up for the issues that affect black people the most. They continue to confirm President Donald Trump\u2019s federal court appointees, who will hear cases of police brutality and voter-ID-law discrimination, despite the fact that he has failed to nominate a single African-American or Latino judge to the federal bench.\n\nThey ignored the suggestion that they filibuster every bill until the Senate and House look at gun control legislation to curb the violence that affects black communities disproportionately. They caved on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals vote during the recent government shutdown. (We often forget how immigration laws disproportionately affect African and Caribbean immigrants.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is the solution?\n\nAs usual, all politics is local. Imagine if\u2014at the local level, which affects us the most\u2014black candidates ran on non-Democratic platforms touting issues that are supported by black voters. In Georgia, there might be the \u201cKeisha\u201d Party, which works on stopping freeways from catching on fire and collapsing. Chicago might have a \u201cTop Gang Thugs\u201d Party.\n\nWhat if we supported valid third-party candidates who aren\u2019t beholden to an agenda beholden to Democratic apologists? What if we\u2014even in one single election\u2014wrote in our own choices? What if we stopped participating in this antiquated, binary system of choices?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis would force the national Democratic Party to engage with and pay attention to black voters and black issues. It would also stop Democrat politicians from appearing in black churches and barbershops only during voting season, and pretending that black voters don\u2019t exist in the intervening periods.\n\nOf course, there is the argument that if black voters didn\u2019t support the Democratic Party, Republicans would take over. Answering that question requires me to switch to all caps. Please hold on.\n\nHOW THE HELL ARE WE WINNING NOW?\n\nRepublicans already control 32 state legislatures, 33 governorships, the U.S. Senate, the House of Representatives and the presidency. They are already in control.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven with that mostly white, Republican control, the Democratic Party refuses to stand by the side of the people most responsible for the party\u2019s existence. Democratic politicians slither away whenever they are challenged, and compromise at every instance of Republican obstinance (not you, Auntie Maxine; we\u2019re still riding with you).\n\nAnd when it comes to Doug Jones, even though he received 93 percent of the black male vote and a whopping 98 percent of the black female vote, he has not demonstrated that he intends to do anything for black Alabama voters. Jones has supported Trump\u2019s position on 60 percent of the issues since black voters sent him to the Senate.\n\nYet black voters will overwhelmingly vote Democrat in the upcoming midterm elections, after which we will sit back and wait for the Democratic Party to take over both branches of the legislature and begin hearings to impeach Trump and his anti-black agenda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m betting it will never happen\u2014not because I am a cynic, but because I know history. I am exhausted from being punished for the good deeds of black people. I have learned what happens when I place my trust in Democrats or good white men.\n\nMy grandmother taught me that.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This post has been updated to clarify that the largest banks will still be required to report their demographic data.", "keywords": ["vote", "white", "party", "jones", "banks", "doug", "report", "voters", "screwed", "senate", "democratic", "black"], "polarity": 0.04582119900301719, "subjectivity": 0.43329168306440996},

Atlanta Monster is a podcast that explores the disturbing and complicated case of Wayne Williams, the person a jury found guilty of what has come to be known as the \u201cAtlanta Child Murders.\u201d\n\nHosted by Payne Lindsey, a documentarian and amateur investigator whose earlier podcast Up and Vanished helped solve the cold case murder of Tara Grinstead in rural Georgia, this show explores the murders of these young boys while examining the culture of Atlanta in the early 1980s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile this is not a perfect podcast (I find it plodding at times, and for a detailed review, see Panama Jackson\u2019s discussion of it here), a few things have become clear: 1) There are more questions than answers about what happened to the boys who were murdered, and 2) since there are so many questions, many black folks in the city of Atlanta have developed theories in an attempt to make sense of it.\n\nSome say the Ku Klux Klan were the ones killing the kids; others, emboldened by homophobia, claim that a child sex ring is the reason they were murdered. Yet one thing is beyond dispute: Twenty-eight kids are dead, and many black people in Atlanta do not believe the official police report.\n\n\n\nThe number of theories about the case got me thinking about how black folks in America, faced with racism that is both systematic and ubiquitous, often do the best we can to make sense of the world by investing in theories that are, upon first examination, fantastical and yet, when examined in context, inherently logical.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor example, remember the Illuminati? People were convinced that Bey and Jay were members, prompting the Queen to say: \u201cY\u2019all haters corny with that illuminati mess.\u201d This theory is both fantastical yet logical. Instead of believing that Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z are, in fact, that brilliant and talented, the only way for some to make sense of their success in a country as racist as America is to believe that they are involved in the Illuminati.\n\nIt is illogical because, well, the Illuminati. But it does make sense for black folks who know what it is to struggle and fight for every dime to see that kind of meteoric come up and be suspicious. This way of thinking is not new. I became intimately acquainted with it when my uncle taught me about the White Man.\n\nUncle Johnny blamed everything on the Man. He said black folks had bad credit because the Man would not give us the same access to capital as he would white folks. He said that black unemployment was bad because the Man wanted black folks to be broke. Johnny was convinced that the white man flooded the black community with drugs to undermine the Black Panthers and that neighborhoods are segregated because the Man did not want \u201cniggas to live next do\u2019 and date his daughters.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the time, I found his conspiracy theories fantastical, but Uncle Johnny was convinced he was right. I now see that he wasn\u2019t wrong. History is clear on the fact that black folks were redlined and denied credit and that the FBI was involved in undermining and dismantling the Black Panther Party. To be black in America is to be a living, breathing, logical end of a conspiracy.\n\nSo while my uncle was incorrect in his assessment that there was a singular white man behind all of these social ills, he was right to think that there was something nefarious going on. According to the Oxford Dictionary, a conspiracy theory is \u201cthe theory that an event or phenomenon occurs as a result of a conspiracy between interested parties; specifically: a belief that some covert but influential agency (typically political in motivation and oppressive in intent) is responsible for an unexplained event.\u201d\n\n\n\nBlack folks are given to this way of thinking because our entire existence in this country is the result of a conspiracy.

The Democratic Party is saying, \u201cI told y\u2019all.\u201d The pundits are giving the entire state of Alabama the credit. Even mainstream media has decided who was most responsible for Doug Jones\u2019 victory over the John Wayne of alleged pedophiles:\n\nYep, according to everyone, \u201cwomen\u201d are the ones who pushed Doug Jones\u2019 campaign for U.S. Senate over the finish line. Not black women. Not even black people. Just women.\n\nBut mostly white women.\n\nAccording to the punditry class, Jones\u2019 victory happened because of all women, including white women. Even though, according to the Washington Post, 63 percent of white women voted for Roy Moore, white women still received credit for the Jones victory. They were the heroes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack women got their shoutouts, and so did black men, but no one dared leave out white women. Although there is no statistical or logical reason to think that white women helped Doug Jones vanquish his opponent, they somehow came down on the right side of history. NBC News whitesplained it this way:\n\nFifty-eight percent of Alabama women voted for the winner, Democrat Doug Jones, including 35 percent of white women, according to exit polling. While that latter figure might not sound like much, it\u2019s more than twice the 16 percent of white Alabama women who voted for President Barack Obama in 2012, the last presidential race in which exit polling was conducted.\n\nWhat. The. Entire. Fuck.\n\nI know some people bristle at the idea that the benefit of whiteness is baked into every molecule of American existence, but the previous paragraph should be included in the dictionary alongside the phrase \u201cwhite privilege.\u201d Imagine taking an exam in front of the entire country, getting 63 percent of the answers wrong and\u2014not only do you pass the test\u2014but you are called to come to the front of the entire class so the professor can pat you on the back!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut wait ... there\u2019s more.\n\nThen there was the venerable political reporter Beth Clayton, who became the mouthpiece of the white-woman savior class. Immediately following the election, Clayton appeared on MSNBC to explain how white women had saved the world. She tied the election to the Harvey Weinstein sexual harassment scandal and the #MeToo movement (started by a black woman). She proudly explained to Chris Hayes:\n\nWhen you look at women in across Alabama or in any corner of the United States, we\u2019ve all been in a situation where a man didn\u2019t treat us right, and we know that feeling. And we know how it feels to not be believed. And we showed up and we said, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to tolerate it.\u201d And it helps that, looking across the country, women were beginning to be believed in all corners of America. And they felt confident coming out here in Alabama where, frankly, we frankly don\u2019t have a lot of room to wiggle here. And women came out, and we said, \u201cNo more.\u201d and frankly, no more. We deserve better than this.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI doubt she meant it in the way it came off, which is exactly why this Caucaplanation rubbed me the wrong way as soon as I saw it.\n\nWho the hell is \u201cwe\u201d? Clayton must have some black women in her purse, because \u201cwe\u201d didn\u2019t do a damn thing. The vast majority of white \u201cwe\u2019s\u201d voted for the other guy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack people are 26 percent of the population in Alabama, but the Washington Post says they were 29 percent of Tuesday\u2019s electorate. Conversely, whites are 68 percent of Alabama\u2019s population, yet only 66 percent voted in Alabama\u2019s Senate race.\n\nLet\u2019s put it this way: Using AL.com\u2019s raw vote totals and the Washington Post\u2019s exit polls, if all the women in the state assembled themselves and each of Jones\u2019 black female supporters stood beside a white woman who voted for him, there would still be 82,278 black women standing by themselves wondering, \u201cWhere the white women at?\u201d\n\n\n\nNow, explain to me, again, who \u201cshowed up.\u201d\n\nNot white women. That is a fact. Again ... numbers.\n\nWhite women are used to that. They get a privilege no one else in the world enjoys. They get to rail against the white male patriarchy while forgetting the pale crooked fingers that pointed the lynchers in the direction of Emmett Till or the mob that burned down Black Wall Street. They get to decry affirmative action while benefiting from it. They get the front page of Time magazine for changing the country\u2019s attitude about sexual assault while never mentioning the black woman who started the whole thing. They get to scream, \u201cBelieve all women\u201d while simultaneously calling Aurora Perrineau a goddamn liar when she says she was raped by their white friend.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe caveat of \u201cFewer white women supported Moore than supported Trump\u201d is a stupid reason to include white women among the reasons for why the molesting equestrian lost his bid for office. Saying that white women helped Moore win is like saying the Golden State Warriors won their first NBA championship because of Festus Ezeli. And I know you\u2019re wondering: \u201cWho the hell is Festus Ezeli? Did he even get in the game?\u201d\n\n\n\nExactly.\n\nYet they are proudly parading around, poking out their chests, proclaiming, \u201cWe did it.\u201d No one is saying white women didn\u2019t contribute. No one would even say they didn\u2019t work hard. They get to share the championship because they were on the team that scored the most points. But they don\u2019t get to act like they\u2019re they most valuable players.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet\u2019s be clear:\n\nBlack women are the MVPs.\n\nWhite women will tell you that all women are beautiful, delicate creatures who deserve to be protected, appreciated and placed on a pedestal. They say anyone who doesn\u2019t honor all women should be reviled. But they will vote for a pussy grabber. They will cast votes for a child molester.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen they say \u201cMe too,\u201d notice the subtle emphasis on the \u201cme\u201d part. The \u201ctoo\u201d is just to make sure they will be included in the victory celebration. Even when they fail the test.

While I was too young and too far away at the time to be directly affected by the Atlanta Child Murders\u2014a name given to the rash of murders of black children from many of Atlanta\u2019s impoverished communities from 1979 to 1981\u2014the era, subsequent search for, and eventual prosecution and conviction of Williams marked a very dark spot on the city.\n\nThe case involved disenfranchised black communities, the Ku Klux Klan, potential race wars, the Mayor\u2019s Office, the Atlanta Police Department, the FBI, the Chattahoochee River, Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jr., James Baldwin and even a 1985 CBS miniseries called The Atlanta Child Murders, which included stars like James Earl Jones and Ruby Dee, as well as Morgan Freeman, which just proves that where there is blackness, there is Morgan Freeman.\n\nEven some of Atlanta\u2019s hip-hop acts have woven the tales into their rhymes, with lines like, \u201c ... the only thing we feared was Williams, Wayne ... ,\u201d courtesy of Andr\u00e9 3000 on Goodie Mob\u2019s standout \u201cThought Process\u201d from their debut album, Soul Food, and again on their follow-up album, Still Standing\u2019s \u201cGutta Butta,\u201d this time courtesy of Khujo Goodie, where he states, \u201c ... and they know where to dump that ass, in the Cha-ttahootchee River with the rest of the kids ... ,\u201d a nod to the fact that several of the bodies of missing children, as well as those of two adult men, which ultimately brought down Wayne Williams, were found in the river.\n\nThe case of Williams and the Atlanta Child Murders has been the subject of books, essays and documentaries. Aside from the aforementioned miniseries, Soledad O\u2019Brien also did a deep dive into the case for CNN.\n\nAs a case, it\u2019s fascinating because so many actually believe that Williams is innocent, including family members of some of the murdered children, who think that Williams was used to cover up the true murderer, who might have been a white person or persons who could have torn the city apart at the seams.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf he was (or is) innocent, Williams did himself no favors, having failed several polygraphs and fabricating information given to the police. Also, circumstantial DNA evidence makes him responsible for at least the two adult cases, and he was tied to many of the child cases, though not all.\n\nNow, courtesy of HowStuffWorks and Tenderfoot TV, comes the podcast Atlanta Monster, hosted by Payne Lindsey. The podcast is a several-weeks-long podcast that takes the deep-dive, investigative journalistic approach to looking at the case. The podcast rehashes familiar information, but with new looks and interviews with people connected to the case and from locals in Atlanta who were children at that time.\n\nIt\u2019s two episodes in, and to call it riveting would be underselling it tremendously.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s also triggering. The entire story is about the deaths of almost 30 children; black children from some of Atlanta\u2019s poorest and most vulnerable communities. There were mothers and fathers and brothers and sisters separated from their kids and siblings. Grandmothers who sent their grandchildren to the store and never saw them again.\n\nAs a parent, I find the thought of losing a child nightmarish. Like this? Lord. I cannot imagine being a parent who had to watch the news, only to find out that another child was found dead, knowing that one\u2019s own child was missing, and sitting with evaporating hope and prayer each day. That must be one of the most harrowing experiences ever.\n\nWhile it is a case that was closed more than 30 years ago and is largely unspoken of\u2014especially in Atlanta\u2014the idea of vulnerable children being at the heart of it can make the story hard to listen to.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor many adults in Atlanta who were children at the time of the child murders, after Williams was caught, he was akin to a bogeyman. I\u2019ve heard him referenced as, \u201cBe careful or Wayne Williams will get you.\u201d While the podcast is two episodes in, I can tell it will go there, considering that locals from Atlanta\u2019s west side are enlisted to recount the history.\n\nThat\u2019s one thing about this podcast so far that\u2019s interesting to listen to: Most documentaries I\u2019ve seen talk to family and law enforcement, but this includes actual Atlantans who grew up during the time, and not just politicians, but regular folks living in the city. We get to hear how it felt during that time.\n\nI\u2019m not the biggest podcast person, but this is one worth listening to because it revisits a case that captured national attention, and gripped a city, particularly the black citizens, while the white citizens were largely ambivalent. And then, once a person was convicted, the city pretended that it never happened.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExcept it did happen; the city of Atlanta lost a significant number of its youths because nobody took the case seriously for almost a year because we were talking about black children. In episode 2, it\u2019s mentioned that during the terror, a fake call came in to authorities, threatening to kill a white child, and how that heightened some tensions. It\u2019s like A Time to Kill all over again.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a podcast to check out, this might be your bag, baby. Even though we know how it ends\u2014at least those of us familiar with the case\u2014the new information and rehashing of a case that affected so many families so like many of ours is worth the listen to hear how a community dealt with the loss of its youths.

Atlanta Monster is a podcast that explores the disturbing and complicated case of Wayne Williams, the person a jury found guilty of what has come to be known as the \u201cAtlanta Child Murders.\u201d\n\nHosted by Payne Lindsey, a documentarian and amateur investigator whose earlier podcast Up and Vanished helped solve the cold case murder of Tara Grinstead in rural Georgia, this show explores the murders of these young boys while examining the culture of Atlanta in the early 1980s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile this is not a perfect podcast (I find it plodding at times, and for a detailed review, see Panama Jackson\u2019s discussion of it here), a few things have become clear: 1) There are more questions than answers about what happened to the boys who were murdered, and 2) since there are so many questions, many black folks in the city of Atlanta have developed theories in an attempt to make sense of it.\n\nSome say the Ku Klux Klan were the ones killing the kids; others, emboldened by homophobia, claim that a child sex ring is the reason they were murdered. Yet one thing is beyond dispute: Twenty-eight kids are dead, and many black people in Atlanta do not believe the official police report.\n\n\n\nThe number of theories about the case got me thinking about how black folks in America, faced with racism that is both systematic and ubiquitous, often do the best we can to make sense of the world by investing in theories that are, upon first examination, fantastical and yet, when examined in context, inherently logical.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor example, remember the Illuminati? People were convinced that Bey and Jay were members, prompting the Queen to say: \u201cY\u2019all haters corny with that illuminati mess.\u201d This theory is both fantastical yet logical. Instead of believing that Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z are, in fact, that brilliant and talented, the only way for some to make sense of their success in a country as racist as America is to believe that they are involved in the Illuminati.\n\nIt is illogical because, well, the Illuminati. But it does make sense for black folks who know what it is to struggle and fight for every dime to see that kind of meteoric come up and be suspicious. This way of thinking is not new. I became intimately acquainted with it when my uncle taught me about the White Man.\n\nUncle Johnny blamed everything on the Man. He said black folks had bad credit because the Man would not give us the same access to capital as he would white folks. He said that black unemployment was bad because the Man wanted black folks to be broke. Johnny was convinced that the white man flooded the black community with drugs to undermine the Black Panthers and that neighborhoods are segregated because the Man did not want \u201cniggas to live next do\u2019 and date his daughters.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the time, I found his conspiracy theories fantastical, but Uncle Johnny was convinced he was right. I now see that he wasn\u2019t wrong. History is clear on the fact that black folks were redlined and denied credit and that the FBI was involved in undermining and dismantling the Black Panther Party. To be black in America is to be a living, breathing, logical end of a conspiracy.\n\nSo while my uncle was incorrect in his assessment that there was a singular white man behind all of these social ills, he was right to think that there was something nefarious going on. According to the Oxford Dictionary, a conspiracy theory is \u201cthe theory that an event or phenomenon occurs as a result of a conspiracy between interested parties; specifically: a belief that some covert but influential agency (typically political in motivation and oppressive in intent) is responsible for an unexplained event.\u201d\n\n\n\nBlack folks are given to this way of thinking because our entire existence in this country is the result of a conspiracy. We were stolen from our homeland, brought to this country and treated like cattle, all while being taught that we were intellectually and aesthetically inferior. Then, when we created art, it was stolen, as Elvis took from Big Mama Thornton and Led Zeppelin took from Muddy Waters and Willie Dixon. Therefore, the black inclination to believe in conspiracy theories is a logical response to the unfathomable institutional oppression we\u2019ve faced since the first enslaved African stepped foot on America\u2019s shores.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause there are more questions than answers about what happened to the 28 black lives that were taken in Atlanta, I understand why conspiracy theories have developed in the presence of questionable justice. If the powerful in this country have a track record of disregarding black life, why should we believe them when they say they\u2019ve found someone who has taken it?\n\n", "keywords": ["folks", "theories", "conspires", "sense", "man", "white", "atlanta", "believe", "black", "country", "conspiracy", "easy"], "polarity": 0.01376062209395543, "subjectivity": 0.44569103735770393},

Even with his problematic campaign, he was one of the good ones. He would remember what black voters did for him. How could he not recognize that the only reason he is now referred to as \u201cSen. Doug Jones from the state of Alabama\u201d is the black vote? After all, he\u2019s a Democrat. How could he forget who put him there?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn return, Doug Jones and the Democratic Party, once again, have thrown black people to the wolves.\n\nPolitico magazine reports that on Wednesday, the Senate passed a bank-deregulation bill that rolls back many of the regulations imposed on banks and lenders. The bill passed with the support of the Trump administration, Republican senators and 17 Democratic senators\u2014most of whom are considered to be moderate or conservative Dems. The legislation now moves to the House of Representatives, where it is expected to pass.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor more than a decade I have been trying to push the idea that blackness has evolved past its murky racial and cultural definition. As a college macroeconomics instructor, I taught a class, Race as an Economic Construct, that advocated examining race through the lens of data and numbers. (The science of economics is not limited to the production and distribution of goods, services and wealth.)\n\nOne of the easiest ways to illustrate this point is with the history of black homeownership. Homeownership is the biggest builder of wealth in America and is still affected by the history of segregation, Jim Crow and redlining. It fuels every indicator of discrimination in this country and is one of the best examples of the manifestation of white supremacy.\n\nHousing discrimination relegated African Americans to homogeneous, poor black communities with underfunded, segregated schools. Poorer schools create the education gap. The education gap creates employment disparities. Underemployment creates poverty and the phenomenon called \u201cblack-on-black crime.\u201d Poverty leads to the inability to acquire affordable housing, which relegates black people to low-income communities, which leads to underfunded schools, which leads to more crime and so on. It is a vicious circle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is all about homeownership.\n\nWe have always known this. The Root has routinely reported on the difficulties black people encounter when buying a home. A recent report by the Center for Investigative Reporting, along with Reveal News, uncovered how U.S. banks systematically prevent blacks and Hispanics from becoming homeowners.\n\nJPMorgan Chase paid $55 million in January to settle charges that it discriminated against black and Latino borrowers. In 2011, Bank of America handed over $335 million for making its minority customers pay more than its white customers for the same loans. A federal lawsuit against Wells Fargo alleges that the bank has discriminated against Philadelphia\u2019s black and Latino borrowers since 2004.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is an indisputable fact that many banks treat their black customers unequally. The only reason we know this is that banks are required to report demographic data on most mortgage loans. That data is publicly available to anyone who wants to look at it.\n\nAmong other things, the legislation passed by the Senate on Wednesday strips away for some banks the requirement to report the race, ethnicity and gender of their mortgage customers. Under the new proposal, only the largest banks will have to report demographic data, which means that it will be impossible to find out if the other banks discriminate. If the law passes, these banks will be able to deny black customers without fear of repercussion or lawsuits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Democratic Party could have singled out that provision to the public and made a fuss. They could have called it racist (because it is racist), which would have made the legislation lose support. They could easily have refused to vote for this bill unless that specific provision was stripped away.\n\nSen. Doug Jones from the state of Alabama voted for it.\n\nThis is the Democratic Party.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: The Democratic Party is only a viable party because of the black vote. In the 2016 election, 88 percent of blacks voted for the Democratic candidate, while only 37 percent of whites voted for Hillary Clinton, according to exit polls by USA Today. Even before the most recent election, according to Pew Research, only 40 percent of whites identified as Democrats.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf not for black voters, there would not be a Democratic Party. Without the black vote, Dems would lose every election at the local, state and national levels. The Democratic Party\u2019s leadership knows this. The Republican Party knows this.\n\nYet Democratic politicians repeatedly refuse to stand up for the issues that affect black people the most. They continue to confirm President Donald Trump\u2019s federal court appointees, who will hear cases of police brutality and voter-ID-law discrimination, despite the fact that he has failed to nominate a single African-American or Latino judge to the federal bench.\n\nThey ignored the suggestion that they filibuster every bill until the Senate and House look at gun control legislation to curb the violence that affects black communities disproportionately. They caved on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals vote during the recent government shutdown. (We often forget how immigration laws disproportionately affect African and Caribbean immigrants.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is the solution?\n\nAs usual, all politics is local. Imagine if\u2014at the local level, which affects us the most\u2014black candidates ran on non-Democratic platforms touting issues that are supported by black voters. In Georgia, there might be the \u201cKeisha\u201d Party, which works on stopping freeways from catching on fire and collapsing. Chicago might have a \u201cTop Gang Thugs\u201d Party.\n\nWhat if we supported valid third-party candidates who aren\u2019t beholden to an agenda beholden to Democratic apologists? What if we\u2014even in one single election\u2014wrote in our own choices? What if we stopped participating in this antiquated, binary system of choices?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis would force the national Democratic Party to engage with and pay attention to black voters and black issues. It would also stop Democrat politicians from appearing in black churches and barbershops only during voting season, and pretending that black voters don\u2019t exist in the intervening periods.\n\nOf course, there is the argument that if black voters didn\u2019t support the Democratic Party, Republicans would take over. Answering that question requires me to switch to all caps. Please hold on.\n\nHOW THE HELL ARE WE WINNING NOW?\n\nRepublicans already control 32 state legislatures, 33 governorships, the U.S. Senate, the House of Representatives and the presidency. They are already in control.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven with that mostly white, Republican control, the Democratic Party refuses to stand by the side of the people most responsible for the party\u2019s existence. Democratic politicians slither away whenever they are challenged, and compromise at every instance of Republican obstinance (not you, Auntie Maxine; we\u2019re still riding with you).\n\nAnd when it comes to Doug Jones, even though he received 93 percent of the black male vote and a whopping 98 percent of the black female vote, he has not demonstrated that he intends to do anything for black Alabama voters. Jones has supported Trump\u2019s position on 60 percent of the issues since black voters sent him to the Senate.\n\nYet black voters will overwhelmingly vote Democrat in the upcoming midterm elections, after which we will sit back and wait for the Democratic Party to take over both branches of the legislature and begin hearings to impeach Trump and his anti-black agenda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m betting it will never happen\u2014not because I am a cynic, but because I know history. I am exhausted from being punished for the good deeds of black people. I have learned what happens when I place my trust in Democrats or good white men.\n\nMy grandmother taught me that.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This post has been updated to clarify that the largest banks will still be required to report their demographic data.", "keywords": ["vote", "white", "party", "jones", "banks", "doug", "report", "voters", "screwed", "senate", "democratic", "black"], "polarity": 0.04582119900301719, "subjectivity": 0.43329168306440996},

I want to say it\u2019s scarier than Chrisette Michelle, but God ain\u2019t through with her yet and neither is Satan.\n\nLosing Republican candidate for senator, and man voted \u201cMost Likely to Rub Up Against You\u201d by customers at the Forever 21 inside the Gadsden Mall, Roy Moore still hasn\u2019t conceded the Alabama Senate race yet. But today he released his first full statement after he got his ass whipped by Doug Jones in their head-to-head battle of good vs. evil.\n\nInstead of calling Jones like a real man, Moore released a video to the media. (He said it was for his followers, but Alabama evangelicals don\u2019t watch videos online. That\u2019s how the devil steals your soul. One minute you\u2019re watching YouTube, and the next minute you\u2019re infected with \u201cthe gay\u201d and you\u2019re soliciting sex in an airport bathroom. That\u2019s how they getcha! Larry Craig said so.)\n\nThe video is the absolute craziest piece of white-mannery ever seen. Rarely do we get to see white people laid this bare. (I mean ... I do, because I live in Alabama, but I\u2019m talking about the royal \u201cwe\u201d here.) If you\u2019re like me, it might give you the shivers when you realize how close we were to having this man cast actual votes to determine the policy of our country!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere are the top 10 moments from the speech:\n\n10. The subtle touches of white supremacy.\n\nI\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t notice the statue of the Confederate soldier in the background. How do I know it\u2019s a Confederate soldier and not a quick rendering of him riding to the polls on Tuesday? Here\u2019s how I know: Because this is Roy motherfucking Moore!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen there\u2019s the Christmas tree in the background for our Lord and Savior, Caucasian Baby Jesus, coupled with Moore\u2019s cross lapel pin, which he sets on fire at the end (not shown in the video). And the whole entire wall is covered by the flag, which is the whitest shit ever. Not that the American flag is white, but they didn\u2019t even iron it! If I went on TV with even a tiny wrinkle, my mother would rise from her grave and beat me to death. And my mother\u2019s not even dead.\n\nBut the wrinkles would have killed her.\n\n9. He opens with a direct shoutout to white nationalists.\n\nHe isn\u2019t even trying to be subtle. It\u2019s as if someone told him to dog-whistle and he yelled: \u201cHey dogs! Come over here!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe are indeed in a struggle to preserve our republic, our civilization and our religion. And to set free a suffering humanity. And the battle rages on ...\u201d is the motto of the \u201calt-right.\u201d OK, I might not be right about that, but it\u2019s at least the first line on the Wikipedia page for white nationalism. It\u2019s probably their pledge of allegiance.\n\nThe belief that America\u2019s foundation of Western civilization is being destroyed by blacks, Mexicans, Muslims and Jews is the basis for the alt-right argument. This is the thesis statement of the white supremacist constitution. (I know what you\u2019re thinking. Yes, it is rife with grammatical errors.) Also, whenever anyone says \u201cand the battle rages on,\u201d they have probably spent the afternoon turning their white bedsheets into a robe.\n\n8. He is lying.\n\nHe states that he is waiting for the provisional and absentee ballots to be counted. Absentee ballots are counted first. There are fewer than 3,000 provisional ballots. He lost by 20,715 votes. Something doesn\u2019t add up. And by \u201csomething,\u201d I mean \u201cnumbers.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut again, he\u2019s from Alabama, which ranks 47th in education. So ... math.\n\n7. He shouts out Donald Trump.\n\nMoore says he \u201csaw a window of hope\u201d with the election of Trump. Something about the Founding Fathers and the Constitution. Blah, blah, blah. This is another dog whistle to white people. Whenever they invoke the Founding Fathers, they really mean \u201cwhite people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor white people, the top 10 list of the most important white people goes like this:\n\nBaby Jesus\n\nThe Founding Fathers\n\nGrown-man, ripped-abs, hipster Jesus\n\nRonald Reagan\n\nDead, killed-by-the-Jews Jesus\n\nThe Beatles\n\nThe troops\n\nFrank Sinatra\n\nTheir dog (they consider them people)\n\nWinston Churchill\n\n\n\nIn that order.\n\n6. Then he goes batshit crazy.\n\n\u201cToday we no longer recognize the universal truth that God is the author of our life and liberty. Abortion, sodomy and materialism have taken the place of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,\u201d Moore explains. Then this motherfucker starts preaching!\n\n[W]e have forgotten God. ... We have stopped prayer in schools. We\u2019ve murdered over 60 million of our unborn children. We\u2019ve redefined marriage and destroyed the basis of family, which is the building block of our country. ... We\u2019ve even begun to recognize the right of a man to claim to be a woman, and vice versa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis. Man. Almost. Won.\n\n5. He doesn\u2019t believe that his alleged pedophilia is a problem.\n\nLet\u2019s say that all the women who said Moore tried to holla at them during their 10th-grade study hall period are liars. Moore apparently believes that his molestation charges are relevant to the political process, because he says, \u201cEven our political process has been affected with baseless and false allegations which have become more relevant than the true issues which affect our country.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWait ... what? Sexual assault and pedophila are not \u201ctrue issues\u201d? According to him, the gay and trans thing affects us all more than a grown man trolling the middle school parking lot trying to take our daughters behind the dumpster for a makeout session.\n\n4. He says that money from \u201coutside groups\u201d turned the election.\n\nHe didn\u2019t say that when alt-right whisperer Steve Bannon endorsed him. He didn\u2019t mention this when Trump rallied for him. Or when the Republican National Committee sent him money. It\u2019s the \u201coutsiders\u201d who tainted the election.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI guess the 671,151 Alabamians who went to the polls and said \u201cnot you\u201d were all outsiders. Gotcha.\n\n3. Then it got crazier.\n\nAgain he says: \u201c[A]nd the battle rages on. Together we must stand against those who would take from us our country.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOur country.\u201d Who is \u201cour\u201d? He already told you that it\u2019s not the gays. Not the transgender. He specifically notes that America doesn\u2019t belong to the Muslims because they don\u2019t believe in \u201cour religion.\u201d\n\n2. Wait ... what?\n\nDid you notice anything missing? Does this concession video seem to be lacking anything? Let me give you a hint:\n\nHe. Does. Not. Concede.\n\nHe never says \u201cThe people of Alabama have spoken\u201d or admit that he was defeated. He doesn\u2019t even mention Doug Jones\u2019 name. There\u2019s another element that he forgot to include in his speech. It may be a small, trivial bit of information, but I think it is at least a tiny bit relevant to the situation:\n\nThe other guy got more votes.\n\n1. The last part.\n\nWhen Moore starts quoting the Bible, the video stops being crazy and starts getting a little bit frightening. I am not afraid of white people, but I am afraid of these kinds of white people. He goes on a school-shooter, religious-fundamentalist-extremist, let-me-say-something-before-I-ignite-the-explosives-packed-in-my-vest rant:\n\nIn the words of the holy Scriptures: \u201cWe wrestle not against flesh and blood but against prinicipalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand an evil day, and having done all\u2014to stand.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT?\n\nDid that scare you as much as it scared me? I am not simply disturbed by his insane pomposity, the fervor in which he quotes the Scriptures or the genuine earnestness in his eyes. But the fact that 650,000 people in Alabama heard him do this all year and believed it is disconcerting on an I\u2019m-black-living-in-a-state-where-most-white-people-voted-for-this-guy level. It is truly indicative of Moore\u2019s dumb, white ... what\u2019s the opposite of \u201cHotep\u201d?\n\nI would call him evil, but instead, I will quote another Scripture:\n\nAnd Jesus answered and said unto them, \u201cTake heed that no man deceive you. For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd here\u2019s another:\n\nJesus wept.\n\nNow we know why.", "keywords": ["moores", "batshitcrazy", "know", "doesnt", "dogwhistle", "white", "man", "moments", "didnt", "moore", "video", "alabama", "racist", "roy", "youre", "god"], "polarity": 0.027840806991750403, "subjectivity": 0.4309272985923928},

While I\u2019m sad that my trigger-happy hometown of Houston had the filming for its spinoff shut down, I\u2019m relieved at how good the Miami season looks to be shaping up. There are people I have actually heard of (Trina, Trick Daddy, Gunplay, Veronica Vega, Pleasure P), and when it comes to those I have never heard of in my natural black-ass life, I\u2019m not bothered\u2014yet, anyway.

The Chi will not only be Showtime\u2019s latest hit but will also be its blackest one in a smooth while.\n\nThe Emmy-winning writer and actress Lena Waithe was kind enough to pass along a screener to her new series, which is executive-produced by both her and Common, and while I don\u2019t want to spoil anything (yes, even for those who have since seen it on YouTube courtesy of Showtime), I will say it\u2019s interesting how a fictitious show about the city of Chicago and its residents feels more real than many of the stories reported from national media. That has a lot to do with those at the helm of The Chi, and while we shouldn\u2019t need the reminder at this point, nevertheless, this show reminds us how important it is to allow black people the opportunity to tell our own stories.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Chi premieres Jan. 7 on Showtime.\n\n\n\n3. Omarosa will probably get a book deal, but no one will give a damn.\n\nOmarosa Manigault Newman is trying to creep her ass back into the community after opportunistically latching herself onto the white-nationalist-themed campaign and administration of that bigoted, narcissistic jerk-off. Given that she has name recognition, worked for his administration and is relentless in her quest for airtime, she won\u2019t exactly go away.

Someone should tell that buffoon that you don\u2019t constantly come for the entire FBI and get away with it. Beyond that, there\u2019s a New York attorney general who still aims to make time for 45 and his band of dingbats. Not to mention, it will be leak city.

Not everything is shade. Sometimes it\u2019s a read, which is not the same as shade, and while I could explain the difference for the umpteenth time, I refuse because I don\u2019t want to help y\u2019all.

The Democrats will win the House of Representatives.\n\nNew York Times columnist Bret Stephens fancies himself a conservative intellectual, but considering that that wing of the American political system is run by a village idiot who requires that his intelligence briefings be dumbed down with bullet points and avoid any emotional triggering (re: Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election), that\u2019s rather meaningless. This is especially true of Stephens, who notoriously doesn\u2019t believe in climate change. Beloved, if you can\u2019t even master what Captain Planet taught the world by cartoon, your political analysis is literary manure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis includes a recent column in which he warns that the Democrats are walking into a \u201cTrumpian trap.\u201d What does that mean? Nothing; it means nothing. No one likes Sweet Potato Saddam, and the GOP is run by two factions: crazy, evil billionaires and the poorer morons who think like them but don\u2019t enjoy the same tax bracket. So while the Donkey Party does often behave like asses, that asshole in the White House is making it all too easy for former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi to get her gavel back. The only thing propping up the GOP right now is racial gerrymandering, and that\u2019s really the only thing that could prevent the devastating electoral fade awaiting them.\n\nP.S.: Black people will save the day, but most of the pundits on cable news will whitewash the shit and pretend that it was suburban white people who did it, despite all obvious evidence to the contrary.\n\n\n\n8.

The redevelopment has been so dramatic, the name of the neighborhood has changed. Some now call it Eastside\u2014a colonizing portmanteau of East Liberty and the neighboring (and predominantly white) Shadyside.\n\nThis is also where I grew up. And the East Liberty of the early and mid-\u201990s was a vastly different place than it is today. From 1989 to 1995, my parents and I lived on the 700 block of Mellon Street, perhaps the hottest stretch in what was then a crime- and gang-infested neighborhood. I\u2019ve seen it all\u2014drive-bys, crack, stabbings, shootings, murders. My mom was even shot while sleeping in her bed by a drug dealer who mistook our house for a rival\u2019s and shot through our windows. (The bullet ricocheted off a wall and hit her wrist.)\n\nBasically, I know what it means to live in the hood because, well, I\u2019ve lived in the hood. And I also know that misinformation about living in the hood is pervasive, existing everywhere from news articles and TV shows about it to the conversations that people not from it have about it. Some of these inaccurate presumptions and outright lies are a bit more popular\u2014and a bit more dangerous\u2014than the rest. Here are 10:\n\n1. Kids who are smart are teased and bullied for \u201cacting white.\u201d\n\nAdmittedly, this experience is/was, in fact, the reality for many kids from the hood. I don\u2019t want to pretend as if these things didn\u2019t happen to them. But that experience is often thought of as the norm, when it\u2019s more of the exception.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, teasing and bullying might happen, because teasing and bullying happen everywhere. But if you\u2019re a kid in the hood who has some sort of academic/intellectual talent, it\u2019s more than likely that you\u2019ll have people in the neighborhood supporting and protecting you than trying to beat the \u201cwhiteness\u201d out of you.\n\n2. People in the hood face constant pressure from drug dealers and/or gang members to join them.\n\nAgain, I\u2019m sure there are many people who were, in fact, pressured to join gangs and/or hustle. But the idea of every hood being overrun by aggressive dopeboys threatening everyone to be down just ain\u2019t true. If anything, they\u2019re mostly nonchalant about it, like, \u201cIf you wanna be down, fine. If not, that\u2019s fine too. It\u2019s whatever.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, keeping with this theme ...\n\n3. All drug dealers have money.\n\nOf course, there are some who do quite well financially. But there are many others\u2014so many others\u2014who\u2019d be making considerably more money at Home Depot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Most young people don\u2019t make it past 21.\n\nI\u2019ve always been annoyed at the idea that kids from the hood are lucky to make it to 21. While the murder rates are definitely dangerously and depressingly high in many neighborhoods, it\u2019s not like 75 percent. Most people from the hood make it to 21. And 31. And 41. And 51. (But not 61, because stress.)\n\n5. You must know how to fight because that\u2019s the only way you would\u2019ve been able to survive.\n\nEh, no.\n\nOf course, being able to handle yourself is a valuable skill to have. But you know what\u2019s more valuable? Walking and looking like you know how to handle yourself. And being hyperaware of your surroundings so you know how to avoid situations where you\u2019d be forced to handle yourself. And having friends or family who can handle themselves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso ...\n\n6. If you want to avoid the trappings of the hood, you should probably stay in the house as much as possible.\n\nPerhaps this was/is a good strategy for some people. But in my experience, the best way to avoid finding trouble was staying busy with activities. Sports, school, art, work, whatever. Of the people I knew who got caught up, the main thing that caught them was sheer boredom. They spent all of their time on the block because they didn\u2019t have shit else to do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. There are no middle-class families in the hood.\n\nUntrue. Because of structural racism and historical restrictions on where black people were/are able to rent and buy property (and there have been numerous studies proving this), it\u2019s not terribly uncommon to find people with middle-class incomes in those neighborhoods.\n\n8. There are no nuclear families in the hood.\n\nYes, there are actually nuclear families in the hood. This means that there are actually black children who happen to live in the hood and under the same roof as their dads\u2014who also happen to be married to their moms. Crazy, right?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. Poor black parents don\u2019t care about their children.\n\nOne of the most common ways this \u201ctruth\u201d is articulated is through parent-teacher conferences. Basically, that in more affluent (read: white) neighborhoods, parents are so hyperinvolved that teachers have to make specific schedules to accommodate all of the parents interested in meeting with them. Whereas teachers in the hood are lucky to speak to/meet one parent\u2014which is seen as an obvious sign of disinterest and/or neglect.\n\nThe reality, however, is more complicated. Sometimes the parent just isn\u2019t able to take off work and attend. Sometimes the parent hasn\u2019t had the best relationship with schools and teachers, and sincerely believes their child would fare better without their involvement. Sometimes the parent just isn\u2019t aware that the parent-teacher conferences are happening because the school didn\u2019t bother sending any notices to them. Either way, it\u2019s dangerous to believe that lack of income somehow correlates to lack of interest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. People in the hood are controlled by a constant fear of violence.\n\nOf course, violence exists. It destroys lives, rips apart families and can, in some cases, create a sense of post-traumatic stress disorder. Violence fucking sucks.\n\nBut while violence is a reality, it doesn\u2019t prevent the entire hood from leaving the house. Or from hanging out on the corner. Or from being neighborly and friendly. Or from attending and perhaps even throwing block parties. Even the hottest blocks will have kids double-Dutching and playing touch-tab football on them. You might even find some old heads laughing and drinking tea on a porch. Maybe you\u2019d assume they were celebrating making it past 21. But they probably just want to talk to one another about 401(k)s.", "keywords": ["know", "handle", "east", "families", "believing", "need", "lies", "hood", "parents", "kids", "course", "stop", "happen", "neighborhood", "misconceptions", "spreading"], "polarity": 0.14255499438832772, "subjectivity": 0.48307671957671966},

Flores was speaking about her choice to have an abortion at age 16. How she didn\u2019t want to experience the hardship of her \u201csix other sisters,\u201d who all \u201cbecame pregnant in their teens.\u201d\n\n\n\nFlores\u2019 unapologetic recounting of her own abortion while defending a sex education bill on the assembly floor shot her to national fame. Her life experience\u2014growing up poor as one of 13 children to Mexican immigrant parents, dropping out of high school, going to jail, and eventually getting her law degree\u2014informed her commitment to fighting for reproductive rights and low-income women. It also made her the perfect face to spread the message of pro-choice political advocacy group EMILY\u2019s List.\n\nIn 2014, when Flores ran for the state\u2019s lieutenant governor seat, she was nominated to be a Rising Star of the year. Every year, EMILY\u2019s List Rising Stars program highlights a group of candidates on their website, many of them women of color, who are nominees people can \u201cvote\u201d for by entering in their email address. The point is to raise candidates\u2019 profiles and help EMILY\u2019s List by building out their email lists.\n\nAs a Rising Star, Flores flew around the country, from San Francisco to Chicago to Texas, taking time out of her own campaign to tell her life story to EMILY\u2019s List donors. \u201cI was good on the stump and had an inspiring story,\u201d Flores explained. \u201cI was someone that could get their donors excited.\u201d\n\nThere was just one problem: Flores rarely got to meet those donors, despite asking EMILY\u2019s List for help. At the events she spoke at, Flores recalled that \u201cmost of the time I couldn\u2019t get them to set up a single meeting, and if they did, I was lucky to get maybe one or two.\u201d For Flores, it felt like her story was being \u201cleveraged\u201d to boost EMILY\u2019s List, for which she got little in return. \u201cThey never did any specific fundraising for me,\u201d she said, at the panels or retreats they sent her to.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe message was clear: It was about which candidate could raise more money.\n\nFlores lost that race, but went on to run for Nevada\u2019s 4th congressional seat in 2016. EMILY\u2019s List, which had endorsed Flores three times previously, decided to instead back her challenger, Susie Lee, a wealthy, white philanthropist who had never held office before. The move raised eyebrows in the national news. Many of Flores\u2019 supporters accused EMILY\u2019s List\u2019s move as payback for Flores\u2019 endorsement of Bernie Sanders over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic primary.\n\nEMILY\u2019s List categorically denied this accusation, and declined to comment publicly on Flores\u2019 experience to Splinter. But the reason that Lucinda Guinn, EMILY\u2019s List vice president of campaigns, gave to a Flores supporter in an email obtained by the Las Vegas Review-Journal was perhaps more telling of the group\u2019s priorities: \u201cSusie is clearly the strongest candidate in this race\u2014she currently has over half a million dollars more in her campaign account than Lucy, who hasn\u2019t built an operation capable of communicating with voters this time around.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe message was clear: It was about which candidate could raise more money.\n\nIn the end, neither woman came up victorious. Despite backing from EMILY\u2019s List, Lee still ended up in third in the primary behind Flores, who came in second to then-state senator Ruben Kihuen.\n\n\n\nEMILY\u2019s List was founded in 1985 by Ellen Malcolm, an heiress to a vast IBM fortune. Its story is one of the hallowed tales of the Beltway: One winter morning, Malcolm brought together a group of women and asked, \u201cAll right, what do we have to do to finally elect a Democratic woman to the Senate?\u201d According to the Washington Post, every woman there had the same answer: getting women money early in their campaigns so they could establish their viability.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThus, the political action committee whose name stands for Early Money Is Like Yeast (\u201cit makes the dough rise\u201d) was born. It had the singular goal of getting Democratic pro-choice women in office.\n\nAt the time of its founding, a Democratic woman had never been elected to the Senate without previously filling in an unexpired seat. A year later, Barbara Mikulski broke that glass ceiling and she gave EMILY\u2019s List, which raised 20 percent of everything Mikulski brought in during her first reporting period, a large part of the credit for her success. \u201cEMILY\u2019s List was absolutely crucial to my campaign,\u201d Mikulski told the Post at the time.\n\nSince then, EMILY\u2019s List has become a behemoth organization within the Democratic Party. It has played a big part in changing the political landscape for women over the past three decades. In the 2016 election cycle, the group raised a record $90 million. As the largest national resource for women in politics, securing EMILY\u2019s List backing is an essential boost for for many women running for office.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf you waste $100,000 on someone who will lose, that\u2019s $100,000 you don\u2019t have to spend on other women.\u201d\n\nThe group \u201chelped provide validity to this idea that a woman running for office is not a weakness,\u201d William Cubbison, a former political operative who worked at Lillian\u2019s List, a North Carolina organization modeled after EMILY\u2019s List, told me. \u201cThey spent a lot of time and effort building this idea that women have something unique to add to the political conversation,\u201d he said, \u201cand women have a responsibility to put in time and money to elect other women.\u201d\n\nYet despite incremental gains over the past decade, the number of women at all levels of government has plateaued at around 20 percent. When it comes to female representation in the legislature, the U.S. ranks 99th in the world. In the last two election cycles, EMILY\u2019s List came out with a poor showing\u2014in 2016, the group had a 40 percent win rate according to OpenSecrets.org, a website that tracks money in politics. In 2014, a notoriously bad year for Democrats, the group only won a quarter of the time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt would be unfair to single out EMILY\u2019s List for these losses; the Democratic Party itself has been decimated in every level of government over the past decade. And in the year since the 2016 election, the party in general\u2014which desperately needs to mobilize and motivate a younger and more diverse electorate\u2014has proven to be slow to catch up to the changing political dynamics of the country.\n\nBut with the surge of women signing up to run after Donald Trump\u2019s election, it\u2019s worth evaluating EMILY\u2019s strategies and asking whether or not the organization is staying true to its original mission.\n\nFor women like Flores, the answer is a firm no. \u201cThey go through this entire dog and pony show about their humble beginnings and yet they will turn around and say you\u2019re not raising enough money, we\u2019re going to go ahead and pass,\u201d Flores said. It was, in her eyes, antithetical to EMILY\u2019s List own professed origin story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFlores\u2019 experience was one of the more egregious cases of qualified women appearing to be passed over by EMILY\u2019s List, but her story is not the only one. A recent Intercept piece detailed how progressive candidates across the country are finding it difficult to gain the support of the Democratic Party infrastructure, an infrastructure that often includes EMILY\u2019s List.\n\nTake Jess King, a candidate vying for the Democratic nomination to face off against Republican Lloyd Smucker in what was formerly Pennsylvania\u2019s 16th district. (The district was one of the few that became more red in the recent redrawing of the state\u2019s new congressional map.) King, who is running a populist campaign with the support of many local grassroots groups, reached out to EMILY\u2019s List multiple times but, aside from the group sending King a questionnaire form which she filled out, did not hear back.\n\nInstead, EMILY\u2019s List aligned with the rest of the Democratic establishment by endorsing mainstream Democrat Christina Hartman, who had ran and lost to Smucker in 2016. (Because of the new maps, Hartman dropped out of the race this week and moved to the 10th district.) Guido Girgenti, King\u2019s spokesperson, told the Intercept that EMILY\u2019s list did not even extend a courtesy call.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEMILY\u2019s List sees candidates as disposable commodities.\u201d\n\n\u201cMillions of women are struggling to make ends meet, working minimum-wage jobs and stretching every dollar for their kids,\u201d King told me over email. \u201cIf we care about working moms like me, we need to fight for policies like Medicare-for-all, universal childcare, and debt-free college. I hope EMILY\u2019s List will also consider candidates\u2019 positions on those issues when endorsing in the future.\u201d\n\nCandidates like King, who outraised her EMILY\u2019s List-backed opponent in the fourth quarter through small-dollar donations, have shown that traditional avenues of raising money, such as being a self-funder, are no longer the only way to go. And then there are the times when more money doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into victories, like when Lee had more cash on hand in 2016 but still finished behind Flores.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I asked Alexandra De Luca, a spokesperson for EMILY\u2019s List, about their decision not to back King, she said the surge in the number of women running is \u201ca good problem for us to have. It\u2019s often that there is more than one awesome pro-choice Democratic women in a race. We take these races on a case-by-case basis.\u201d In response to whether or not the group over-emphasizes fundraising when endorsing, De Luca said, \u201cwe look for candidates who have a path to victory who are going to put in the work.\u201d But, she added, \u201cfundraising is an important part of a campaign.\u201d\n\nOf course, money is important and tough decisions have to be made with limited resources. As Cubbison put it, \u201cIf you waste $100,000 on someone who will lose, that\u2019s $100,000 you don\u2019t have to spend on other women.\u201d But the money-as-viability model can be particularly damaging for women who start out with fewer political and financial connections, which often means women of color, low-income women, and those living in rural areas.\n\n\u201cEMILY\u2019s List has been similar to a lot of other D.C. organizations, where they want to back people who can win,\u201d Cubbison said. It\u2019s a \u201cvicious circle\u201d that especially affects women of color: \u201cThey are not perceived as viable, so no one supports them, but they are not viable because no one\u2019s supporting them.\u201d (On their endorsement page, EMILY\u2019s List has backed 59 candidates running for a Congressional or gubernatorial seat, a large majority of whom are white. Only two, Stacey Abrams and Lauren Underwood, are black women.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKimberly Peeler-Allen, co-founder of Higher Heights, the only organization exclusively dedicated to increasing black women\u2019s political engagement, told me over email that fundraising remains a big obstacle. \u201cBlack women often run in districts that do not have the resources to support their candidacy, so they must raise money outside the district,\u201d Peeler-Allen wrote. \u201cA candidate\u2019s viability cannot be determined solely on the total dollars raised. Many black women have run and won when they have been outraised by their competitors, because they had the operation and message that was most compelling to move voters to the polls.\u201d\n\nHigher Heights, which was founded in 2011, partners with EMILY\u2019s List to ensure that all black women coming through their doors \u201care supported in a holistic manner.\u201d\n\nEMILY\u2019s List often responds to criticism that they support mainly white, wealthy candidates by pointing out that 40 percent of the women the group has helped to elect on the federal level are women of color. And the Intercept\u2019s evaluation of current primary races found that while the main variable to party support was fundraising, \u201cestablishment Democrats of today are just as willing\u2014or perhaps more so\u2014to back a lesbian woman of color as they are a straight, white man, and the same is true on the left.\u201d De Luca pointed to the group\u2019s endorsements of diverse candidates like Abrams who is running for Georgia\u2019s governor\u2019s seat and Veronica Escobar, who is running in Texas\u2019s 16th district.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, as in the case of Flores, it matters how some of those women are treated after they\u2019re endorsed. \u201cMy experience is really just a demonstration of how EMILY\u2019s list sees candidates,\u201d Flores said. \u201cThey see them as disposable commodities. The purpose in that commodity is to raise them money and raise their stature. Once you are no longer serving those two purposes, you are disposable to them.\u201d\n\n\u201cEMILY\u2019s List gave me some consultants to hire. But I\u2019m a public school teacher. I can\u2019t afford to hire anybody.\u201d\n\nFlores\u2019 experience raised eyebrows with women of color. Felicia Ortiz, who serves on the Nevada State Board of Education, told me EMILY\u2019s List had recently called her up to ask for a contribution. She had supported them in the past, but after seeing what happened to Flores, Ortiz declined. \u201cIt left a bad taste in my mouth,\u201d Ortiz told me. \u201cWith everything that\u2019s going on [after Donald\u2019s Trump\u2019s election], I decided to use my money more wisely.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe pointed out the large Hispanic population in her state. \u201cI don\u2019t see organizations like EMILY\u2019s List supporting candidates that are going to truly represent our communities.\u201d\n\nEMILY\u2019s List often works in lockstep with the greater Democratic establishment. And the party has shown that it can be stubbornly slow to change. (Many sources seemed hesitant to publicly criticize EMILY\u2019s List, given how large they loom in Democratic politics.) Critics on the left believe that part of the reason for this boils down to the ecosystem of consultants benefiting from the fundraising-first model.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne Democratic operative pointed out that Jonathan Parker, former campaign director at EMILY\u2019s List, was married to Tierney Hunt, a founder of the consulting firm New Media Firm, Inc. \u201cNew Media Firm was making tons of money on media buys because EMILY\u2019s List more than often gave her the contract,\u201d this operative, who asked to stay anonymous because of risks to their job, told me. \u201cThis stymies creativity and stymies consultants who are willing to take a risk.\u201d\n\nKaren Mallard, a public school teacher who was inspired to run as a first-time candidate for a Congressional seat in Virginia\u2019s 2nd district after Trump\u2019s election, told the Intercept that she had met with someone at EMILY\u2019s List in D.C., who promised to introduce her to people at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. But the Democratic Party decided instead to concentrate on two male candidates successively (who each dropped out) before recruiting a third candidate, Navy veteran Elaine Luria. (Luria twice voted for Scott Taylor, the GOP representative she would be challenging, which her campaign manager told the Richmond Times-Dispatch was because \u201cElaine doesn\u2019t make decisions just based on political party.\u201d)\n\n\u201cEMILY\u2019s List gave me some consultants to hire,\u201d Mallard told the Intercept. \u201cBut I\u2019m a public school teacher. I can\u2019t afford to hire anybody.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe relationships between organizations like EMILY\u2019s List and their preferred consultants is certainly nothing new, but they don\u2019t look great for a party that needs to shake the image of establishment grift. (The DCCC recently made the extraordinary move of releasing opposition research attacking Laura Moser\u2014a fellow Democratic activist candidate who is running against EMILY\u2019s List-backed Lizzie Pannill Fletcher\u2014for spending campaign money on her husband\u2019s consulting firm, despite the fact that the DCCC and EMILY\u2019s List regularly partake in the same practice.)\n\nThe question is whether or not EMILY\u2019s List\u2019s parameters are too broad to effectively harness the progressive energy in 2018.\n\nNot to mention that a federal PAC taking over a race can often override a candidates\u2019 local knowledge and expertise. Flores spoke about how EMILY\u2019s List gave her a list of consultants to hire during her lieutenant governor\u2019s race, which she felt pressured to use. \u201cWhen they endorse you, it\u2019s very clear that you will not only disclose most of your campaign info to them, but you\u2019re also going to use the consultants that they assign you.\u201d Flores said that because of the close ties between EMILY\u2019s List and the Democratic Party in her state, she didn\u2019t really have a choice in the matter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn Nevada, if I did not do as EMILY\u2019s List told me,\u201d that affected \u201csupport I was getting within Democratic Party. It\u2019s all connected.\u201d\n\nIn essence, EMILY\u2019s List plays it safe. While getting any pro-choice women elected might have been a radical bet in 1985, now\u2014in large part due to EMILY\u2019s List\u2014that tide has shifted. But with so many pro-choice women running for office, the unspoken ideological factors that go into the group\u2019s endorsement process are becoming clearer.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe question, then, is whether or not EMILY\u2019s List\u2019s parameters are too broad to effectively harness progressive energy in 2018. Take reproductive rights, EMILY\u2019s List\u2019s signature issue. The concept of a pro-choice candidate cannot be evaluated on that criterion alone, since the issue of reproductive justice is so tightly interwoven with racial and economic justice. True freedom of choice means having the capacity to raise\u2014or not raise\u2014a child with dignity and basic material support.\n\nThis means a party that doesn\u2019t have a knee-jerk reaction against candidates who support a slew of full-throated social programs. As Katie McDonough wrote in Splinter, \u201cThe extreme right has managed to learn a lesson about reproductive freedom that the Democratic Party still hasn\u2019t grasped: It\u2019s bigger than just the clinic, bigger than the Supreme Court.\u201d In the face of Trump\u2019s administration, which has passed a radically regressive tax bill, is looking to slash welfare programs, and whose ICE agents are terrorizing immigrants on a daily basis, EMILY\u2019s List\u2019s litmus tests\u2014that a candidate must only be female, Democratic, and pro-choice\u2014seem more and more insufficient.\n\nAnd the recent wave of female first-time candidates and challengers to incumbents, at every level of government, means that it might be time for all establishment organizations to start rethinking their strategy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDe Luca pointed out that EMILY\u2019s List has tripled the size of their state and local team and expanded their digital program, which included launching a series of webinars to help reach women in more rural areas. But much of this still seems like they are leading from behind\u2014and as their pattern of recent endorsements has shown, the group hasn\u2019t really shaken up its recipe.\n\n\u201cIf we want to seize tens of thousands of women signing up for office, we have to start going outside of traditional political strategies of the past,\u201d said Erin Vilardi, founder of VoteRunLead, an organization that focuses on training women to run for state and local races. \u201cThat includes doubling down on women of color, and maybe not looking so strongly at incumbents.\u201d\n\nVilardi started VoteRunLead in 2003 as part of the now-shuttered White House Project, a non-profit organization focused on increasing female representation, because she found there was a void in resources for training women at the local and state level, especially for women of color and those in rural areas. According to Vilardi, VoteRunLead trained more women than any other group last year, 3,200 in live classes and 6,500 in recorded ones, 60 percent of who were women of color. Since November 2017, 70 percent of women trained by VoteRunLead running for the first time won their races (the usual win rate for newcomers is 10 percent).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been stuck at 20 percent female representation,\u201d Vilardi says. \u201cWe have to try for a recipe that calls for more than federal PAC money.\u201d\n\nMuch of the recent energy of women signing up to run is driven, as New York magazine\u2019s Rebecca Traister puts it, by the alluring idea of replacement. This means the replacement, yes, of Donald Trump and his kleptocratic cabal of wealthy white men, but also of men in every party and at every level of government.\n\nBut true replacement cannot be built around the disgust of one man, or even most men. For women to reach political, racial, and economic parity, it will also mean changing the political infrastructure that has gotten us to where we are today, including within the Democratic Party. EMILY\u2019s List, for better or for worse, has become one of the pillars of that infrastructure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEMILY\u2019s List was always intended to be an organization that changes the status quo\u2014the fact that the Democratic Party willingly embraces pro-choice female candidates today is a testament to that work. Yet as we sit at the cusp of what could be a historic year for women, the organization seems to be relying on the same old playbook.", "keywords": ["told", "emilys", "flores", "women", "lost", "party", "political", "candidates", "way", "democratic", "money", "list"], "polarity": 0.11738926586677459, "subjectivity": 0.39798384333851483},

Atlanta Monster is a podcast that explores the disturbing and complicated case of Wayne Williams, the person a jury found guilty of what has come to be known as the \u201cAtlanta Child Murders.\u201d\n\nHosted by Payne Lindsey, a documentarian and amateur investigator whose earlier podcast Up and Vanished helped solve the cold case murder of Tara Grinstead in rural Georgia, this show explores the murders of these young boys while examining the culture of Atlanta in the early 1980s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile this is not a perfect podcast (I find it plodding at times, and for a detailed review, see Panama Jackson\u2019s discussion of it here), a few things have become clear: 1) There are more questions than answers about what happened to the boys who were murdered, and 2) since there are so many questions, many black folks in the city of Atlanta have developed theories in an attempt to make sense of it.\n\nSome say the Ku Klux Klan were the ones killing the kids; others, emboldened by homophobia, claim that a child sex ring is the reason they were murdered. Yet one thing is beyond dispute: Twenty-eight kids are dead, and many black people in Atlanta do not believe the official police report.\n\n\n\nThe number of theories about the case got me thinking about how black folks in America, faced with racism that is both systematic and ubiquitous, often do the best we can to make sense of the world by investing in theories that are, upon first examination, fantastical and yet, when examined in context, inherently logical.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor example, remember the Illuminati? People were convinced that Bey and Jay were members, prompting the Queen to say: \u201cY\u2019all haters corny with that illuminati mess.\u201d This theory is both fantastical yet logical. Instead of believing that Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z are, in fact, that brilliant and talented, the only way for some to make sense of their success in a country as racist as America is to believe that they are involved in the Illuminati.\n\nIt is illogical because, well, the Illuminati. But it does make sense for black folks who know what it is to struggle and fight for every dime to see that kind of meteoric come up and be suspicious. This way of thinking is not new. I became intimately acquainted with it when my uncle taught me about the White Man.\n\nUncle Johnny blamed everything on the Man. He said black folks had bad credit because the Man would not give us the same access to capital as he would white folks. He said that black unemployment was bad because the Man wanted black folks to be broke. Johnny was convinced that the white man flooded the black community with drugs to undermine the Black Panthers and that neighborhoods are segregated because the Man did not want \u201cniggas to live next do\u2019 and date his daughters.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the time, I found his conspiracy theories fantastical, but Uncle Johnny was convinced he was right. I now see that he wasn\u2019t wrong. History is clear on the fact that black folks were redlined and denied credit and that the FBI was involved in undermining and dismantling the Black Panther Party. To be black in America is to be a living, breathing, logical end of a conspiracy.\n\nSo while my uncle was incorrect in his assessment that there was a singular white man behind all of these social ills, he was right to think that there was something nefarious going on. According to the Oxford Dictionary, a conspiracy theory is \u201cthe theory that an event or phenomenon occurs as a result of a conspiracy between interested parties; specifically: a belief that some covert but influential agency (typically political in motivation and oppressive in intent) is responsible for an unexplained event.\u201d\n\n\n\nBlack folks are given to this way of thinking because our entire existence in this country is the result of a conspiracy. We were stolen from our homeland, brought to this country and treated like cattle, all while being taught that we were intellectually and aesthetically inferior. Then, when we created art, it was stolen, as Elvis took from Big Mama Thornton and Led Zeppelin took from Muddy Waters and Willie Dixon. Therefore, the black inclination to believe in conspiracy theories is a logical response to the unfathomable institutional oppression we\u2019ve faced since the first enslaved African stepped foot on America\u2019s shores.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause there are more questions than answers about what happened to the 28 black lives that were taken in Atlanta, I understand why conspiracy theories have developed in the presence of questionable justice. If the powerful in this country have a track record of disregarding black life, why should we believe them when they say they\u2019ve found someone who has taken it?\n\n", "keywords": ["folks", "theories", "conspires", "sense", "man", "white", "atlanta", "believe", "black", "country", "conspiracy", "easy"], "polarity": 0.01376062209395543, "subjectivity": 0.44569103735770393},

Even with his problematic campaign, he was one of the good ones. He would remember what black voters did for him. How could he not recognize that the only reason he is now referred to as \u201cSen. Doug Jones from the state of Alabama\u201d is the black vote? After all, he\u2019s a Democrat. How could he forget who put him there?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn return, Doug Jones and the Democratic Party, once again, have thrown black people to the wolves.\n\nPolitico magazine reports that on Wednesday, the Senate passed a bank-deregulation bill that rolls back many of the regulations imposed on banks and lenders. The bill passed with the support of the Trump administration, Republican senators and 17 Democratic senators\u2014most of whom are considered to be moderate or conservative Dems. The legislation now moves to the House of Representatives, where it is expected to pass.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor more than a decade I have been trying to push the idea that blackness has evolved past its murky racial and cultural definition. As a college macroeconomics instructor, I taught a class, Race as an Economic Construct, that advocated examining race through the lens of data and numbers. (The science of economics is not limited to the production and distribution of goods, services and wealth.)\n\nOne of the easiest ways to illustrate this point is with the history of black homeownership. Homeownership is the biggest builder of wealth in America and is still affected by the history of segregation, Jim Crow and redlining. It fuels every indicator of discrimination in this country and is one of the best examples of the manifestation of white supremacy.\n\nHousing discrimination relegated African Americans to homogeneous, poor black communities with underfunded, segregated schools. Poorer schools create the education gap. The education gap creates employment disparities. Underemployment creates poverty and the phenomenon called \u201cblack-on-black crime.\u201d Poverty leads to the inability to acquire affordable housing, which relegates black people to low-income communities, which leads to underfunded schools, which leads to more crime and so on. It is a vicious circle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is all about homeownership.\n\nWe have always known this. The Root has routinely reported on the difficulties black people encounter when buying a home. A recent report by the Center for Investigative Reporting, along with Reveal News, uncovered how U.S. banks systematically prevent blacks and Hispanics from becoming homeowners.\n\nJPMorgan Chase paid $55 million in January to settle charges that it discriminated against black and Latino borrowers. In 2011, Bank of America handed over $335 million for making its minority customers pay more than its white customers for the same loans. A federal lawsuit against Wells Fargo alleges that the bank has discriminated against Philadelphia\u2019s black and Latino borrowers since 2004.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is an indisputable fact that many banks treat their black customers unequally. The only reason we know this is that banks are required to report demographic data on most mortgage loans. That data is publicly available to anyone who wants to look at it.\n\nAmong other things, the legislation passed by the Senate on Wednesday strips away for some banks the requirement to report the race, ethnicity and gender of their mortgage customers. Under the new proposal, only the largest banks will have to report demographic data, which means that it will be impossible to find out if the other banks discriminate. If the law passes, these banks will be able to deny black customers without fear of repercussion or lawsuits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Democratic Party could have singled out that provision to the public and made a fuss. They could have called it racist (because it is racist), which would have made the legislation lose support. They could easily have refused to vote for this bill unless that specific provision was stripped away.\n\nSen. Doug Jones from the state of Alabama voted for it.\n\nThis is the Democratic Party.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: The Democratic Party is only a viable party because of the black vote. In the 2016 election, 88 percent of blacks voted for the Democratic candidate, while only 37 percent of whites voted for Hillary Clinton, according to exit polls by USA Today. Even before the most recent election, according to Pew Research, only 40 percent of whites identified as Democrats.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf not for black voters, there would not be a Democratic Party. Without the black vote, Dems would lose every election at the local, state and national levels. The Democratic Party\u2019s leadership knows this. The Republican Party knows this.\n\nYet Democratic politicians repeatedly refuse to stand up for the issues that affect black people the most. They continue to confirm President Donald Trump\u2019s federal court appointees, who will hear cases of police brutality and voter-ID-law discrimination, despite the fact that he has failed to nominate a single African-American or Latino judge to the federal bench.\n\nThey ignored the suggestion that they filibuster every bill until the Senate and House look at gun control legislation to curb the violence that affects black communities disproportionately. They caved on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals vote during the recent government shutdown. (We often forget how immigration laws disproportionately affect African and Caribbean immigrants.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is the solution?\n\nAs usual, all politics is local. Imagine if\u2014at the local level, which affects us the most\u2014black candidates ran on non-Democratic platforms touting issues that are supported by black voters. In Georgia, there might be the \u201cKeisha\u201d Party, which works on stopping freeways from catching on fire and collapsing. Chicago might have a \u201cTop Gang Thugs\u201d Party.\n\nWhat if we supported valid third-party candidates who aren\u2019t beholden to an agenda beholden to Democratic apologists? What if we\u2014even in one single election\u2014wrote in our own choices? What if we stopped participating in this antiquated, binary system of choices?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis would force the national Democratic Party to engage with and pay attention to black voters and black issues. It would also stop Democrat politicians from appearing in black churches and barbershops only during voting season, and pretending that black voters don\u2019t exist in the intervening periods.\n\nOf course, there is the argument that if black voters didn\u2019t support the Democratic Party, Republicans would take over. Answering that question requires me to switch to all caps. Please hold on.\n\nHOW THE HELL ARE WE WINNING NOW?\n\nRepublicans already control 32 state legislatures, 33 governorships, the U.S. Senate, the House of Representatives and the presidency. They are already in control.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven with that mostly white, Republican control, the Democratic Party refuses to stand by the side of the people most responsible for the party\u2019s existence. Democratic politicians slither away whenever they are challenged, and compromise at every instance of Republican obstinance (not you, Auntie Maxine; we\u2019re still riding with you).\n\nAnd when it comes to Doug Jones, even though he received 93 percent of the black male vote and a whopping 98 percent of the black female vote, he has not demonstrated that he intends to do anything for black Alabama voters. Jones has supported Trump\u2019s position on 60 percent of the issues since black voters sent him to the Senate.\n\nYet black voters will overwhelmingly vote Democrat in the upcoming midterm elections, after which we will sit back and wait for the Democratic Party to take over both branches of the legislature and begin hearings to impeach Trump and his anti-black agenda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m betting it will never happen\u2014not because I am a cynic, but because I know history. I am exhausted from being punished for the good deeds of black people. I have learned what happens when I place my trust in Democrats or good white men.\n\nMy grandmother taught me that.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This post has been updated to clarify that the largest banks will still be required to report their demographic data.", "keywords": ["vote", "white", "party", "jones", "banks", "doug", "report", "voters", "screwed", "senate", "democratic", "black"], "polarity": 0.04582119900301719, "subjectivity": 0.43329168306440996},

On Tuesday the Alabama Senate race took place. Roy Moore, a repugnant alleged serial child molester who believes that women should not have the right to vote, civil rights should be scrapped and slavery was lit, lost by a hair. Doug Jones, Moore\u2019s opponent, was carried to victory by black folks\u2014specifically black women. Exit polls showed that 98 percent of black women voted for Jones, as compared with 93 percent of black men, 35 percent of white women and 27 percent of white men.\n\n\n\nListen closely. Do you hear it? That, my friend, is the sound of hundreds upon thousands of black women letting out a resounding \u201cWe tried to tell y\u2019all.\u201d\n\nEvery time there is something good in this world\u2014know that black women probably did it first, said it first, seent it first. Someone was so sure about this that they put it on a T-shirt. Conversely, most negative things in this world, black women tried to save you from.\n\nIt was Anita Hill who exposed the predatory nature of men on Capitol Hill, long before Monica Lewinsky\u2019s heels ever stepped on the carpets of the Oval Office. It was Tarana Burke who sent the first #MeToo into the world, 10 years before the movement was appropriated by white feminism. Twenty years prior to the pink pussy hats that filled the streets of our nation\u2019s capital, 750,000 black women gathered for their Million Woman March.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFurthermore, black women were the only demographic that vehemently opposed the election of Donald Trump, and exemplified that in their votes. And 94 percent of black women voted for Hillary Clinton\u201412 more percentage points than black men and over 20 more percentage points than the Latina and Latino population. It is unclear why J. Cole\u2019s \u201cNo Role Modelz\u201d isn\u2019t consistently at the top of the charts\u2014because clearly, this nation don\u2019t wanna be saved.\n\nTrump\u2019s slogan betrays him because it belongs to black women. We have been trying to make America great from the jump. So much nonsense could be avoided if this nation listened to us. There is something unique about black women. Like our male counterparts, we built this nation. However, black women also raised it. We nursed and bathed its children\u2014both black and white\u2014fed its workforce and cleaned its households. We know more about black men, white men and white women than they know about themselves. Therefore, we are in a special position to predict the unknown, advise the unknowledgeable and reshape the unseen future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt would seem that these traits would make America treasure us, holding us up as a pinnacle of wisdom. Instead, as Malcolm X said:\n\nThe most disrespected person in America is the black woman. The most unprotected person in America is the black woman. The most neglected person in America is the black woman.\n\nAnd that\u2019s on a good day. Let\u2019s take a closer look.\n\nThe most disrespected person in America is the black woman.\n\nAs black women, policed by Eurocentric beauty standards, we are routinely attacked for our appearances. Michelle Obama, Rep. Maxine Waters and Leslie Jones are just a few examples of black women whom the internet and media have dragged for filth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur spirited personalities are denounced as inappropriately dominant. Our strong leadership is constantly reduced to words like \u201ccontrolling\u201d and \u201cpushy,\u201d rather than being seen for what it is: dynamic.\n\nSojourner Truth, in her \u201cAin\u2019t I a Woman\u201d speech, conveyed that society claims that women are to be coddled, put on a pedestal and given the best treatment that society has to offer, but no one ever does that for black women. In fact, when it is done for black women, it\u2019s \u201ccorny\u201d\u2014what people call Russell Wilson\u2019s excellent treatment of Ciara. Aren\u2019t we women, too? Do we not deserve to be cherished?\n\n\n\nThe most unprotected person in America is the black woman.\n\nSince slavery, the black woman has been unprotected. We bore whips and savage rape from white slave masters. Our children were ripped away from us and sold as property. We became the targets of forced sterilization, the government\u2019s horrific plan for population control. Our households\u2019 resources waned under the strain of the systemic underemployment and mass incarceration of black men.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPresently, our own community has the audacity to continue this heinous legacy. Sixty percent of black girls experience sexual abuse at the hands of black men before the age of 18. Yet these perpetrators rarely face consequences, because black women instinctively protect black men from white supremacy and imprisonment. Intimate-partner violence is the leading cause of death for black women. Yet these victims are rarely depicted as innocent but, rather, as emasculating, domineering, mouthy instigators.\n\nWe are even punished if we try to protect ourselves, like Marissa Alexander, who received 20 years in prison for firing a warning shot into the air to ward off her violent ex-spouse, or Cyntoia Brown, who is serving a life sentence for shooting a man who purchased her for sex from a sex trafficking ring when she was 16.\n\nBlack Women in Alabama Saved Themselves Last Night If you\u2019ve kept up with how black women roll in American politics, what happened in Alabama last\u2026 Read more Read\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe most neglected person in America is the black woman.\n\nBlack women are often erased from movements we create and/or prop up. Why is it that we can rattle off facts about Malcolm, Martin and Medgar, but rarely hear about the women of the civil rights movement? It was Amelia Boynton who wrote to Martin Luther King Jr., convincing him to come to Selma, Ala., yet there is no mention of her in most movies and textbooks. It was Autherine Lucy Foster who suggested laying Jimmie Lee Jackson\u2019s body on the steps of the Alabama state Capitol, but the idea is often credited to James Bevel. Men may have been the faces of this movement, but women were the strategists.\n\nAfter the 2016 presidential election, white women rushed to adorn Susan B. Anthony\u2019s grave with \u201cI Voted\u201d stickers, but where were the stickers for Shirley Chisholm, Fannie Lou Hamer, Sojourner Truth, Ida B. Wells and Mary Church Terrell\u2014who fought for women\u2019s right to vote even when the racist suffrage movement left them out?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is mirrored today. The Black Lives Matter movement, founded by three black women, is often tied to DeRay Mckesson and Shaun King. #MeToo was founded by Tarana Burke, a black woman, yet its appropriation by white women leaves people out who look like its very founder. White utterances of #MeToo have stripped some of the most notorious men of their power and influence, yet when Lupita Nyong\u2019o and Aurora Perrineau came forward, they were swiftly decried as liars. Black women must alway work twice as hard to get half as far and hope that no one falsely claims even that small victory for themselves.\n\nMaya Pope described America\u2019s relationship with black women best in Scandal\u2019s season 6 finale:\n\nI tell you \u2026 being a black woman. \u201cBe strong,\u201d they say. Support your men. Raise a man. Think like a man. Well, damn. I gotta do all that? Who\u2019s out here working for me? Carrying my burden? Building me up when I get down? Nobody. Black women out here trying to save everybody. We still try. Try to help all y\u2019all, even when we get nothing. God forbid you let a sista like me help you out. No, you don\u2019t want that. Don\u2019t let me put you on my back when you fall, wipe the crust out of your eye, put a pep back in your step. Because when we do, you resent us for making you better, smarter, stronger; then drop us so you can be with someone basic. Someone without all that baggage you left us with. But we still try.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nW.E.B. Du Bois once said that on judgment day, he would forgive slavery, but what he could never forgive was the \u201cpersistent insulting of black womanhood.\u201d And neither can I.

According to Newsweek, Glamour declared it one of the \u201cbiggest moments\u201d of the ceremony.\n\nAttendees posted videos of the moment to social media.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Waters has led a chant calling for the dotard in chief to be removed from office. She did it at the Los Angeles Pride parade over the summer and again at the Women\u2019s Convention in Detroit last month.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWaters has been very vocal about her disapproval of the 45th president. During an interview with The Root at the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation\u2019s 47th Annual Legislative Conference in Washington, D.C., the Democrat called him out for being a white supremacist and for his alleged ties to the Kremlin. She also said that black women can get him out of office (and I\u2019m here for this; let\u2019s do this shit).\n\nEarlier this year, she said that she was putting her \u201ccareer on the line\u201d to speak out against Donald Trump, calling him a \u201cdisgusting, poor excuse of a man\u201d and saying, \u201cI want him impeached.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe must take our anger, our pain, our collective strength to right this wrong, to resist this tyranny and to save our democracy from a man whose immoral character and distorted thinking are an imminent threat to our nation,\u201d Waters said at the time, calling Trump\u2019s Cabinet \u201cill-prepared, right-wing billionaires.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not a fan of the word \u2018impeach,\u2019 but I want him impeached. That\u2019s what he deserves,\u201d she added.\n\nHer vim and vigor when it comes to denouncing the president are probably what got her placed on the new Essence cover, where she looks absolutely regal, like the black queen she is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCome through, Auntie Maxine.

Their energy served as a stand-in for the excitement of folks all over the world; now\u2019s your chance to find out who they are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I got in touch with Lee Colston over the phone last week, he told me that his spirit was full and he was feeling joyful and beautiful and black that day. It was Colston and his friends Clinton Lowe and Chris Holland who shot and appeared in that video, which was retweeted by luminaries like director Ava DuVernay on its volcanic ascent through social media feeds. The three friends all work in the performing arts, as actors, writers, and activists. When recounting the story of the night the video was made, Lowe told me that the conversation didn\u2019t even start with them.\n\nThanks to bad projection, they\u2019d endured a poor movie-going experience at a screening of Star Wars: The Last Jedi. When they left the theater, they saw a man posing in front of a Black Panther display. \u201cThe man had his family with him and was trying to tell them why this was so important to him,\u201d Lowe said. \u201c[The family with him] were younger so you could tell they were hearing him, but they weren\u2019t hearing him.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe walked up to the poster, politely waiting our turn and he looked at us. He was beaming. The whole thing had us talking shit, improvising but not to make fun of him. Then Lee turns the camera on and what\u2019s in the video is in response to how dude reacted,\u201d he said. \u201cThe context was off an elder\u2019s response. There was a generational connection; he\u2019s been waiting longer than we all have.\u201d\n\n\n\nColston says the older gentleman motioned for someone who was presumably his grandchild to take a picture for him in front of a poster. \u201cHe was just like \u2018look how beautiful you look, look how beautiful she is,\u2019\u201d Colston recalled. \u201cAnd he was just so proud to be seen and to have people who look like him validate his experience. So I said to Clint and Chris, \u2018look how proud and represented he feels.\u2019 This is what white people get to feel like all the time. And that started a conversation about equity in Hollywood and representation. All three of us were aware that we were poking fun with a sort of satire. The reality is that actually white people don\u2019t feel like that all the time because it\u2019s so common for them. They don\u2019t have to fight. They\u2019re not starved for images in the media that represent their full humanity.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnce Colston uploaded the video to his Facebook and Twitter pages, he had a feeling it would go viral. \u201cMy social media goes viral pretty frequently,\u201d Colston offered, \u201cbecause I do a lot of commentary about, you know, art awareness, social justice, and anything that\u2019s like, the intersection of black and brilliant.\u201d\n\nStill, he was shocked when people like Michael B. Jordan and DuVernay retweeted it. \u201cI was over the moon because Ava DuVernay is one of the most brilliant directors working in Hollywood. She\u2019s absolutely brilliant. She\u2019s literally one of my dream directors to work with. Her and Ryan [Coogler].\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHolland didn\u2019t expect it to blow up. \u201cNot at all,\u201d he said. \u201cI was thinking \u2018Okay, we\u2019ll put this up, maybe we\u2019ll get a couple of clicks and likes but I didn\u2019t expect that moment of joy to take off the way it did.\u201d\n\nLowe thinks the energy he and his friends put into arts and activism can be felt in the video. \u201cThat was a moment in the life. If you hang out with us, it\u2019s like that 24/7,\u201d Lowe says. \u201cI co-founded a group called Artists 4 Change NYC after the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson. Individually and collectively, we\u2019ve all been doing work around anti-injustice issues, racism, sexism, and homophobia.\u201d Lowe says the energy they put into that work is what was animating them in that moment.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs far what they thought of the Black Panther movie itself, the three friends all loved it. Colston says he appreciated how the female leads were \u201cso mighty and powerful and strong... It\u2019s just amazing to get gorgeous black women in such an incredible display!\u201d he said. The film\u2019s villain got to him, too.\n\n\u201cKillmonger was just so broken, y\u2019know? I recognized that his [actions] aren\u2019t the answer but his argument made so much sense because it came from a place of being forgotten and brutalized. It\u2019s basically, \u2018If Wakanda is not going to do the moral thing and stand up for people who can\u2019t protect themselves, then I\u2019m going to make sure that the people who are marginalized, at-risk, and under attack, have the resources and equipment to defend themselves since this moral superpower [of Wakanda] is failing them. Who can argue with that?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cMy reaction to the movie is that it\u2019s a celebration of all that we were, all that we are, and all that\u2019s to come,\u201d Lowe told me from Alabama, where he\u2019s acting in a touring production about the life of football legend Bear Bryant. \u201cIt was the dream of the slave. There\u2019s still a long way to go but [Black Panther] represents the beginning of the next phase of work.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c[In Black Panther], we\u2019re not ornaments to a white narrative,\u201d Holland said. The NYU grad student had an intensely personal connection with the movie because of where he grew up. \u201cI\u2019m originally from East Oakland, California; I\u2019m from 79 and MacArthur. My dad works for BART and, growing up, my BART stop was Oakland Coliseum. As soon as that opening shot came up\u2014\u201c1992 Oakland, California\u2014I was lit. I was screaming in the movie theater. Then, that line that Michael B. Jordan says at the end about a kid from Oakland running around believing in fairy tales really got me, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy reaction to the movie is that it\u2019s a celebration of all that we were, all that we are, and all that\u2019s to come.\u201d - Clinton Lowe\n\nOf the three, Colston had the deepest connection to comics before seeing the movie. \u201cI think my first introduction to comics was the Tim Burton Batman films when I was a kid,\u201d he said. \u201cI remember how much they inspired me. Then I got into X-Men and Spider-Man. My first introduction to Black Panther was an animated Fantastic Four series and I went back to go research him and fell in love with the character.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nColston hopes that Black Panther can spark similar epiphanies in the audiences going to see it. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen these films with white people\u2019s humanity on display,\u201d he offered. \u201cBut the inverse isn\u2019t really that true. There\u2019s something powerful about having a six-year-old white kid walk into the film and be completely enraptured with the glory, beauty, and humanity of the characters in this film.\u201d", "keywords": ["internets", "look", "going", "talk", "white", "movie", "lowe", "colston", "friends", "panther", "wakanda", "finally", "favorite", "video", "fans", "work", "black"], "polarity": 0.18402777777777776, "subjectivity": 0.4675264550264549},

It feels like Doug Jones being elected by black people in Alabama, then voting with the Republican Party on the continuing resolution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt feels like spineless disloyalty. It feels like the repeated treachery of someone trading your loyalty for slivers of silver. It feels like black people believing that a white person is their friend. It feels like being a black person believing that the Democratic Party is your friend.\n\nThe Democratic Party is not our friend.\n\nMy grandmother, who had a \u201cgood factory job,\u201d would buy eggs from a local white farmer whom we called the \u201cEgg Man,\u201d and resell them to the people in the neighborhood. I loved that guy, mostly because he gave me a quarter every Saturday and made me laugh hysterically every time he took his dentures out and put them back in.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne day I asked for the Egg Man\u2019s entire name so that I might add him to the list of my nightly prayers. My grandmother told me that the Egg Man was nice, but he was not our friend. When I asked her why she said that, she told me that there were two things that I, as a black boy, could never depend on:\n\na paycheck\n\nwhite friends\n\n\n\nEven though my grandmother never mentioned the Democratic Party, the predictably recurring narrative of the Democrats selling out their black and brown friends has once again repeated itself in the recent government shutdown. It happens so often that it is impossible to ignore, but this most recent case might be the worst because they ran from a fight they could have won. It should be obvious to anyone with a hint of melanin in their skin that the Democratic Party is not our friend.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEvery day for an entire month, they looked us in the eyes and told their constituents how they were going to resist the ethnic-cleansing-lite policy of the Republican Party. \u201cNot a dime until we renew the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals,\u201d they said. \u201cWe\u2019ll shut it down if they don\u2019t agree,\u201d they told us. If Congress funded the government, Dems promised that the GOP would have to do it without a single Democratic vote.\n\nThey were lying the whole time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: A lie is a lie whether it is preplanned or not. If I promise to give you a dollar tomorrow, it does not matter what transpires in the meantime. If I don\u2019t hand you four quarters, I lied.\n\nThe reason for the Democratic Party\u2019s betrayal does not matter. Whether they caved because of the mounting prospect of the shutdown being renamed the \u201cSchumer Shutdown,\u201d or because they were bluffing from the beginning, is inconsequential. No one cares why they lied, only that they are habitual liars.\n\n\u201cBut the Childhood Health Insurance Plan ... ,\u201d they will tell you. Republicans were already unanimously in favor of CHIP. They were going to fund it anyway!\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut we secured a vote for DACA,\u201d they say.\n\nA vote? A motherfucking vote? How can you stand in front of black, Hispanic and Muslim voters for a year telling them how the Republicans were lying, xenophobic racists, and then turn around and explain to those same voters how you acquiesced because they promised you that they would perhaps think about considering the possibility of allowing a vote on something they vehemently hate?\n\nThe Democratic Party is better than the Republican Party in the way that manslaughter is slightly better than murder: It might seem like a lesser crime, but the victim can\u2019t really tell the difference.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDemocrats are the minority party. They know that Republicans will never vote for DACA unless it comes with funding for a wall, and the only thing Dems could negotiate out of a government shutdown was a vote where the entire world will get to see them lose. (OK, I admit that the entire world probably doesn\u2019t watch CSPAN, but still ... )\n\nBut this is how the Democratic Party operates. It is impossible to say whether they remain perpetual losers because of a lack of a plan or because they don\u2019t give a fuck about their nonwhite constituents, but it is telling that their losses somehow always end up costing black and brown people. Always. So much so that I struggle to see how their slick-mouthed equivocation somehow keeps tricking black people into believing that they are on our side.\n\nThey are not.\n\nThe Democratic Party is better than the Republican Party in the way that manslaughter is slightly better than murder: It might seem like a lesser crime, but the victim can\u2019t really tell the difference. In exchange for the unwavering loyalty of black America, we get to live with the Democratic Party\u2019s arm being shoved so far up our anal cavities that not only are we used to acting as their puppets, but we have become comfortable with it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet there are some people so stuck in their binary thinking that they believe that not voting for Democrats, or withholding our vote from the party until we can get something solid in return, is a crazy idea. They will tell you that voting for a third-party candidate is a losing proposition.\n\nI have a rebuttal to that, but first I will have to switch to all caps, because I am about to yell. To those people I say:\n\nYOU ACT AS IF WE ARE WINNING!\n\nSo here we are again, left out in the cold while the Democratic Party gets warm and cozy behind the artifice of solidarity and equality. They are tricksters. They will sit at the table of our last supper and break bread with us, knowing that they have already conspired with the enemy planning our crucifixion. We know they are going to betray us, but we are always surprised when the cock crows.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey get us every time.\n\nThey will lock arms with you and claim that they are your \u201cride or die.\u201d They are always by your side, but if there ever comes a time when you have to stand back-to-back and fight, those white friends will likely disappear. They are always willing to ride. They are never willing to die.\n\nThey will suck down Champagne in the VIP section of the club like the Dems did after the special election for Alabama\u2019s Senate seat. White women were shaking their titties, taking shots of Patr\u00f3n, screaming, \u201cWe did it,\u201d balling out like they were in a P. Diddy video, knowing that black women were the ones who paid the bill.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhite friends will bounce to the music, singing how they are \u201cdown for their niggas.\u201d Black people watch them dance, smile and vote for them, but whenever the Republicans even hint that they are buck, the Democratic Party is never willing to knuck.\n\nEven when the Democratic Caucus controlled the House and the Senate, they didn\u2019t introduce a single piece of legislation addressing extrajudicial police killings. They still haven\u2019t addressed the Supreme Court\u2019s dismantling of the Voting Rights Act. They haven\u2019t used their clout to direct federal dollars to underfunded schools. They disregard HBCUs. They run from affirmative action. They dodge any mention of reparations.\n\nAnd none of this is to say that the Dems\u2019 duplicity is the fault of the Democratic Party or white people. It is the fault of black people. We have empowered them. No Democrat could win a local, state or national election without the black vote. It is black voters\u2019 fault that we don\u2019t demand anything in return but lip service and bumper stickers. If your employer hired you, paid you every week and never required that you produce any results, how hard would you work?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy grandmother eventually fell out with the Egg Man when he upped his price and started going door-to-door, cutting my grandmother out of the loop. My grandmother, in her infinite pettiness, bought eggs at cost from the supermarket and sold them to her neighbors for a price cheaper than the Egg Man\u2019s, losing money in the process, but neutering the Egg Man. When he came back to our house to cut a deal, she refused.\n\nUntil she died, part of my grandmother\u2019s paycheck went to selling those eggs to people in my neighborhood at a loss. She did it for only one reason\u2014again, I will have to switch to all caps to convey her exact sentiment (and I\u2019m paraphrasing here):\n\nFUCK. THAT. WHITE. MAN.\n\nWhite friends, the Egg Man, Judas Iscariot and the Democratic Party are all the same. Pieces of silver have always been more important to them than black souls.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am sure that a broad association of betrayal, disloyalty and dishonesty with white people will cause some to dismiss this entire argument. I challenge those people to scan back through this entire diatribe and find the lie.

They just prefer that you make up a bunch of wild-ass garbage about those tragedies.\n\n\n\nSurvivors of last week\u2019s school shooting in Parkland, Fla., one of the deadliest in modern American history, have said that they are fed up with no longer feeling safe in school and have loudly called on President Donald Trump and lawmakers to get serious about gun control. While mourning their dead classmates, Stoneman Douglas students have rallied and raised money, and are currently in the state\u2019s capital, Tallahassee, Fla., to push for gun reform.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheir activism has inspired the dregs of the right to cook up the most half-baked, unseasoned conspiracy theories they could muster to explain why students who survived a school shooting could possibly want something as batshit crazy as gun control.\n\nThe only logical answer, according to these professional paste eaters, is that these students are really professional actors.\n\nThat\u2019s what one message from an aide to Florida state Rep. Shawn Harrison alleged, according to the Miami Herald. The paper reports that the Republican\u2019s aide \u201cused state email to send a photo of two students with this message to a reporter: \u2018Both kids in the picture are not students here but actors that travel to various crisis when they happen.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was untrue, and Harrison blamed the aide for the \u201cinsensitive and inappropriate allegation.\u201d That aide is now on leave.\n\nThat was far from the worst of it. More from the Herald:\n\nA blogger at Gateway Pundit, a far-right, pro-Trump website, wrote a piece calling one of the leading student voices \u201ca plant.\u201d It included a picture of student David Hogg with a circle around his head and this statement: \u201cSon of FBI agent.\u201d Hogg was among the first Stoneman Douglas students to appear on networks and cable news demanding tougher laws from state and federal lawmakers. Former U.S. Congressman Allen West, a Republican who served a single term in South Florida as a Tea Party star, also joined in. In one Twitter post, he lumped shooter Nikolas Cruz with five Americans of Middle Eastern descent who claimed connections to terrorist groups. There is no indication that 19-year-old Cruz, who state records show has lived much of his life in Broward County, was a follower of any Muslim terror group.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe allegations around student David Hogg are especially wild, with Twitter users alternately claiming that he had graduated years ago, that he is a filmmaker and reporter, and that an earpiece he used during a live television interview (when, um, earpieces are necessary to hear the in-studio reporter) was actually being used so he could be fed answers.\n\nBusy guy, that Hogg.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the Herald reports, there were also those conspiracy theorists (like the ones who claim the Holocaust and the mass school shooting at Newtown, Conn.\u2019s Sandy Hook Elementary never happened) who denied the Parkland shooting ever happened.\n\nNot surprisingly, some of these theories appear to have been pushed by pro-Russian bots on social media.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerhaps no one captured the deplorable spirit of the whole affair better than convicted felon and global brand ambassador of the sunken place, Dinesh D\u2019Souza, who spent much of Tuesday mocking the Parkland students via his Twitter account.\n\n\u201cWorst news since their parents told them to get summer jobs,\u201d D\u2019Souza wrote Tuesday, commenting on a photo of the students appearing shocked and dismayed as Florida lawmakers voted down a bill to ban assault weapons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the survivors, a 16-year-old girl from Parkland, responded to the grown-ass man bullying her and her classmates on Twitter:\n\n\u201cActually for me the worst news I got was that 17 people died in my school,\u201d Sarah Chadwick wrote, adding that one of her best friends was shot twice and many more students were injured. \u201cBut sure, keep making us look like we don\u2019t know anything when in reality what we\u2019re doing is much much much bigger than you can imagine.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the far right\u2019s desire to write off and disqualify the students who have taken it upon themselves to keep gun control at the forefront of the country\u2019s political conversation, this much is clear: Ultraconservative gun lovers are shook. And they have reason to be: Trump recently said he\u2019d be open to some gun control measures, such as bumping up the age limit for owning certain firearms to 21, as well as banning \u201cbump stocks\u201d (a modification that simulates automatic fire\u2014that wasn\u2019t used in the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting).\n\nTrump is supposed to meet Wednesday with survivors of the Parkland shooting, as well as survivors of the school shootings in Newtown and Columbine, Colo., as he attempts to shift focus to school safety and away from the burning shitstorm of scandals that have engulfed the White House recently.", "keywords": ["school", "theories", "reform", "douglas", "right", "parkland", "used", "aide", "survivors", "shooting", "state", "students", "stoneman", "far", "seeking", "fla", "gun"], "polarity": 0.03770473970473971, "subjectivity": 0.46488156288156285},

If you can\u2019t, it\u2019s probably because you are so accustomed to the sound and feeling of being sold out by the same people you are willing to fight for, you\u2019ve grown numb to the feeling.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt feels like the slave crying on the auction block because he assumed that he was part of Massa\u2019s family. It feels like Timothy Coggins\u2019 family wondering for a quarter century who dragged him behind a truck, stabbed him and left him dead, only to find out that the white population of your town had known for almost 25 years who committed the lynching.\n\nIt feels like canvassing for President Bill Clinton and then hearing his wife call you a \u201csuperpredator.\u201d It feels like an 8-year old being surrounded by his friends ... until they decide to tie a rope around his neck and hang him from a tree ... in 2017. It feels like Doug Jones being elected by black people in Alabama, then voting with the Republican Party on the continuing resolution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt feels like spineless disloyalty. It feels like the repeated treachery of someone trading your loyalty for slivers of silver. It feels like black people believing that a white person is their friend. It feels like being a black person believing that the Democratic Party is your friend.\n\nThe Democratic Party is not our friend.\n\nMy grandmother, who had a \u201cgood factory job,\u201d would buy eggs from a local white farmer whom we called the \u201cEgg Man,\u201d and resell them to the people in the neighborhood. I loved that guy, mostly because he gave me a quarter every Saturday and made me laugh hysterically every time he took his dentures out and put them back in.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne day I asked for the Egg Man\u2019s entire name so that I might add him to the list of my nightly prayers. My grandmother told me that the Egg Man was nice, but he was not our friend. When I asked her why she said that, she told me that there were two things that I, as a black boy, could never depend on:\n\na paycheck\n\nwhite friends\n\n\n\nEven though my grandmother never mentioned the Democratic Party, the predictably recurring narrative of the Democrats selling out their black and brown friends has once again repeated itself in the recent government shutdown. It happens so often that it is impossible to ignore, but this most recent case might be the worst because they ran from a fight they could have won. It should be obvious to anyone with a hint of melanin in their skin that the Democratic Party is not our friend.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEvery day for an entire month, they looked us in the eyes and told their constituents how they were going to resist the ethnic-cleansing-lite policy of the Republican Party. \u201cNot a dime until we renew the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals,\u201d they said. \u201cWe\u2019ll shut it down if they don\u2019t agree,\u201d they told us. If Congress funded the government, Dems promised that the GOP would have to do it without a single Democratic vote.\n\nThey were lying the whole time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: A lie is a lie whether it is preplanned or not. If I promise to give you a dollar tomorrow, it does not matter what transpires in the meantime. If I don\u2019t hand you four quarters, I lied.\n\nThe reason for the Democratic Party\u2019s betrayal does not matter. Whether they caved because of the mounting prospect of the shutdown being renamed the \u201cSchumer Shutdown,\u201d or because they were bluffing from the beginning, is inconsequential. No one cares why they lied, only that they are habitual liars.\n\n\u201cBut the Childhood Health Insurance Plan ... ,\u201d they will tell you. Republicans were already unanimously in favor of CHIP. They were going to fund it anyway!\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut we secured a vote for DACA,\u201d they say.\n\nA vote? A motherfucking vote? How can you stand in front of black, Hispanic and Muslim voters for a year telling them how the Republicans were lying, xenophobic racists, and then turn around and explain to those same voters how you acquiesced because they promised you that they would perhaps think about considering the possibility of allowing a vote on something they vehemently hate?\n\nThe Democratic Party is better than the Republican Party in the way that manslaughter is slightly better than murder: It might seem like a lesser crime, but the victim can\u2019t really tell the difference.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDemocrats are the minority party. They know that Republicans will never vote for DACA unless it comes with funding for a wall, and the only thing Dems could negotiate out of a government shutdown was a vote where the entire world will get to see them lose. (OK, I admit that the entire world probably doesn\u2019t watch CSPAN, but still ... )\n\nBut this is how the Democratic Party operates. It is impossible to say whether they remain perpetual losers because of a lack of a plan or because they don\u2019t give a fuck about their nonwhite constituents, but it is telling that their losses somehow always end up costing black and brown people. Always. So much so that I struggle to see how their slick-mouthed equivocation somehow keeps tricking black people into believing that they are on our side.\n\nThey are not.\n\nThe Democratic Party is better than the Republican Party in the way that manslaughter is slightly better than murder: It might seem like a lesser crime, but the victim can\u2019t really tell the difference. In exchange for the unwavering loyalty of black America, we get to live with the Democratic Party\u2019s arm being shoved so far up our anal cavities that not only are we used to acting as their puppets, but we have become comfortable with it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet there are some people so stuck in their binary thinking that they believe that not voting for Democrats, or withholding our vote from the party until we can get something solid in return, is a crazy idea. They will tell you that voting for a third-party candidate is a losing proposition.\n\nI have a rebuttal to that, but first I will have to switch to all caps, because I am about to yell. To those people I say:\n\nYOU ACT AS IF WE ARE WINNING!\n\nSo here we are again, left out in the cold while the Democratic Party gets warm and cozy behind the artifice of solidarity and equality. They are tricksters. They will sit at the table of our last supper and break bread with us, knowing that they have already conspired with the enemy planning our crucifixion. We know they are going to betray us, but we are always surprised when the cock crows.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey get us every time.\n\nThey will lock arms with you and claim that they are your \u201cride or die.\u201d They are always by your side, but if there ever comes a time when you have to stand back-to-back and fight, those white friends will likely disappear. They are always willing to ride. They are never willing to die.\n\nThey will suck down Champagne in the VIP section of the club like the Dems did after the special election for Alabama\u2019s Senate seat. White women were shaking their titties, taking shots of Patr\u00f3n, screaming, \u201cWe did it,\u201d balling out like they were in a P. Diddy video, knowing that black women were the ones who paid the bill.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhite friends will bounce to the music, singing how they are \u201cdown for their niggas.\u201d Black people watch them dance, smile and vote for them, but whenever the Republicans even hint that they are buck, the Democratic Party is never willing to knuck.\n\nEven when the Democratic Caucus controlled the House and the Senate, they didn\u2019t introduce a single piece of legislation addressing extrajudicial police killings. They still haven\u2019t addressed the Supreme Court\u2019s dismantling of the Voting Rights Act. They haven\u2019t used their clout to direct federal dollars to underfunded schools. They disregard HBCUs. They run from affirmative action. They dodge any mention of reparations.\n\nAnd none of this is to say that the Dems\u2019 duplicity is the fault of the Democratic Party or white people. It is the fault of black people. We have empowered them. No Democrat could win a local, state or national election without the black vote. It is black voters\u2019 fault that we don\u2019t demand anything in return but lip service and bumper stickers. If your employer hired you, paid you every week and never required that you produce any results, how hard would you work?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy grandmother eventually fell out with the Egg Man when he upped his price and started going door-to-door, cutting my grandmother out of the loop. My grandmother, in her infinite pettiness, bought eggs at cost from the supermarket and sold them to her neighbors for a price cheaper than the Egg Man\u2019s, losing money in the process, but neutering the Egg Man. When he came back to our house to cut a deal, she refused.\n\nUntil she died, part of my grandmother\u2019s paycheck went to selling those eggs to people in my neighborhood at a loss. She did it for only one reason\u2014again, I will have to switch to all caps to convey her exact sentiment (and I\u2019m paraphrasing here):\n\nFUCK. THAT. WHITE. MAN.\n\nWhite friends, the Egg Man, Judas Iscariot and the Democratic Party are all the same. Pieces of silver have always been more important to them than black souls.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am sure that a broad association of betrayal, disloyalty and dishonesty with white people will cause some to dismiss this entire argument. I challenge those people to scan back through this entire diatribe and find the lie. Even though it might sound mean and prejudiced, I assure you that I can\u2019t be racist ...\n\n\n\nSome of my best friends are Democrats.", "keywords": ["feels", "friends", "vote", "white", "party", "entire", "grandmother", "friend", "democratic", "black", "egg"], "polarity": 0.01877151719671405, "subjectivity": 0.4567366579177601},

Per usual, black women showed up and showed out at the ballot box, helping Doug Jones win Jeff Sessions\u2019 vacated Senate seat in what was supposed to be a safe victory for Republican candidate Roy Moore.\n\nAll against robust voter-suppression efforts.\n\nA Washington Post exit poll shows that 98 percent of black women voted for Jones, compared with the 63 percent of white women who voted for Moore, a man who faces accusations from several women claiming that he sexually assaulted them as teenagers. It is clear that black women are the moral force of America. Let\u2019s keep it 100. Black women knew the stakes were high. Had Moore won, he would have been one more pro-Donald Trump degenerate black people had to contend with.\n\nBlack women said, \u201cNah, we gon\u2019 come out and take care of this mess.\u201d\n\nThey have always been enthusiastic about voting, as evidenced by the fact that they have outvoted black men since 1984 (pdf). Social protests, namely the shooting deaths of black men by police officers, have already energized black women to hit the streets. That they would harness that same energy to ensure that a racist woman hater would not win a Senate seat should surprise no one.\n\n\u201cBlack women have been leading in grassroots organizing that\u2019s been happening across the South and the nation for several years, particularly since the Trayvon Martin case,\u201d said Bree Newsome, an activist who made international news for scaling a flag post to take down a Confederate flag in South Carolina in 2015. \u201cMany interpret the resistance as having begun in January of 2017, but what we are seeing now is the electoral result of long-term organizing efforts spearheaded by black women. We were actively resisting racism and sexism before Trump and the Alabama Senate race.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nComparatively, white female voters in Alabama proved, yet again, that they cannot be trusted. Essentially, as they did in the 2016 presidential election, white women chose their race over their gender. Upholding white supremacy and patriarchy is still their priority. It is understandable why so many of us declared that \u201cblack women saved America.\u201d\n\nBut let\u2019s be real. White women in Alabama did not really want to be saved. They voted for an alleged child molester. In reality, black women care about themselves and their futures. Republicans in the U.S. Senate support a tax bill that purges the middle class and rally behind a president who attacks Obamacare, which black women rely on and white women need, but they\u2019re too blinded by their racism to realize it.\n\nMeanwhile, #BlackWomen is trending on Twitter, celebrating the organizing power of black female voters. Black women took time to remind readers of what the next steps should be:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking of some of the \u201cy\u2019all,\u201d I asked Leah Wright Rigueur, a professor at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School of Government, why so many white women backed Moore despite his alleged history of sexual assault:\n\nMany do so for complicated reasons, including the fact that they\u2019ve voted Republican their entire life and can\u2019t envision voting for a Democrat. Others do so for less complicated reasons: They support the Republican agenda and therefore will support whatever candidate holds the GOP banner aloft. And then, of course, you have people that will tie themselves in knots to try and rationalize their support of Moore, when, at the end of the day, it boils down to fact that they believe what Moore believes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoom.\n\nBlack women didn\u2019t do this just for Jones or America or the Democratic Party. It\u2019s not as if the relationship is reciprocal in the first place. Black women showed up last night because they are the most eager for progressive change, even though they have historically gotten little in return for it. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) is the only black woman in the U.S. Senate, and black women make up a mere 3.6 percent of Congress, according to Higher Heights. They make up just 3.7 percent of state legislators nationwide and 14.7 percent of all female state legislators in the country. There are only two black lieutenant governors in the union (both men), and no state has ever elected a black female governor. (Ahem, Democratic National Committee, there is a black woman named Stacey Abrams running for Georgia governor.)\n\nMoreover, black women make 63 cents (pdf) of the white man\u2019s dollar, despite being head of the household for more than 50 percent of families with children under 18. They suffer the highest mortality rates after childbirth, and 12 percent (pdf) are uninsured, twice the rate of white women. It\u2019s as if black women keep investing in the Democrats\u2019 stock but get almost no cashable return.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd while praise for black women on Twitter this morning abounds, people should consider how to look at black female voters beyond being mules for the Democratic Party.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a difference between \u2018Black women should do the work\u2019 and \u2018We need to support black women who are doing work,\u2019\u201d said L. Joy Williams, chairwoman of Higher Heights. \u201cIt needs to come with resources and actual support, and not just tweets and retweets and a hashtag.\u201d\n\nThe days of simply thanking black women for saving the day and giving them nothing in return must end. Black women running for office at all levels need money. Lots of it. The DNC needs to appoint them to positions of power in Washington, D.C., and at the local and state levels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe next step is for, not only the DNC, [but] the DCCC [Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee], DSCC [Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee] and all of the Democratic operations ... to evaluate how much of their resources they are going to invest into black women and voters in general way before we get to the end of 2018,\u201d Williams added.\n\nThat is the best thank-you the party and America could offer them.", "keywords": ["women", "white", "night", "voted", "support", "saved", "moore", "voters", "alabama", "senate", "democratic", "black", "female"], "polarity": 0.0004219077568134182, "subjectivity": 0.35432315064390524},

She fixed her teeth, made Billboard chart history, and finessed her way into the ears and hearts of pop culture and into the arms of Offset\u2014one-third of Migos, the hit squad behind club banger \u201cBad and Boujee\u201d\u2014all without actually being bougie herself.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe didn\u2019t achieve any of this without merit: Cardi B was on her grind as an exotic dancer, established herself on social media and parlayed Insta-fame into a Love & Hip Hop feature, which became the springboard for her current success. Her most recent achievement? Being included among a gaggle of seasoned artists nominated for the 2018 Grammy Awards\u2014in not just one category but two.\n\nAnd notably, she did all of this by being herself\u2014all while being \u201chood.\u201d\n\nHailing from Highbridge, a neighborhood in New York City\u2019s South Bronx, Cardi B is the personification of LL Cool J\u2019s 1980s hit \u201cAround the Way Girl.\u201d Her baby hairs are perpetually pumping, and her lip gloss stays popping. Her snarl game is infectious, compliments of a new, blinged-out grill.

They wore extensions in their hair way back when black girls were ostracized for wearing weaves and braids, before \u201cprotective styles\u201d were trending, before buying bundles was a thing.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m talking about the \u201cregular, degular, shmegular\u201d girls from around the way, holding down 9-to-5s and side hustles; juggling school, raising kids and going hard in their ascension to be their best selves. They are a special brand of go-getter who often outperform those around them.

Cardi B is of the same ilk, and although she has upgraded herself materially and physically\u2014in the ways that money and fame allow\u2014we adore her. The girl next door? Not so much. The two are unequally celebrated.\n\nCollectively, we cape for Cardi B. We want to see our favorite underdog win because she is the antithesis of political correctness. And yet we revel in jokes and memes that mock all aspects of the \u201chood chick.\u201d Many are dragged on social media for being body positive, for loving the skin they are in. They\u2019re objectified and policed by trolls and the online respectability police. Meanwhile, Cardi B gets over 7 million views for proudly showing off her cosmetically enhanced tits and ass, and her notoriously long tongue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeldom do we read tales of charming rappers asking for the around-the-way girl\u2019s hand in marriage. Hip-hop is often obsessed with shitting on them and referring to them as \u201cthots,\u201d while Cardi B is offered 3-carat-diamond validation.\n\nAnd the film and television industry is equally complicit as it remains culpable in the erasure and portrayal of our beloved homegirls through exaggerated characters such as Martin\u2019s Sheneneh Jenkins (insultingly played in drag). Like the Sambos of the Jim Crow era, around-the-way girls have long been stereotyped and caricatured. Their image is for consumption and degradation.\n\nBottom line: We, as a people, need to check our respectability politics and selective classism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is clear that Cardi B reigns supreme in the same spaces where others like her are dismissed. Instead of side-eyeing our sisters in the hood\u2014for being extra, for doing \u201cthe most\u201d\u2014perhaps we could salute them for their relentless negritude; for establishing a culture within a society that prefers conformity; for the courage to be themselves.

Even with his problematic campaign, he was one of the good ones. He would remember what black voters did for him. How could he not recognize that the only reason he is now referred to as \u201cSen. Doug Jones from the state of Alabama\u201d is the black vote? After all, he\u2019s a Democrat. How could he forget who put him there?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn return, Doug Jones and the Democratic Party, once again, have thrown black people to the wolves.\n\nPolitico magazine reports that on Wednesday, the Senate passed a bank-deregulation bill that rolls back many of the regulations imposed on banks and lenders. The bill passed with the support of the Trump administration, Republican senators and 17 Democratic senators\u2014most of whom are considered to be moderate or conservative Dems. The legislation now moves to the House of Representatives, where it is expected to pass.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor more than a decade I have been trying to push the idea that blackness has evolved past its murky racial and cultural definition. As a college macroeconomics instructor, I taught a class, Race as an Economic Construct, that advocated examining race through the lens of data and numbers. (The science of economics is not limited to the production and distribution of goods, services and wealth.)\n\nOne of the easiest ways to illustrate this point is with the history of black homeownership. Homeownership is the biggest builder of wealth in America and is still affected by the history of segregation, Jim Crow and redlining. It fuels every indicator of discrimination in this country and is one of the best examples of the manifestation of white supremacy.\n\nHousing discrimination relegated African Americans to homogeneous, poor black communities with underfunded, segregated schools. Poorer schools create the education gap. The education gap creates employment disparities. Underemployment creates poverty and the phenomenon called \u201cblack-on-black crime.\u201d Poverty leads to the inability to acquire affordable housing, which relegates black people to low-income communities, which leads to underfunded schools, which leads to more crime and so on. It is a vicious circle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is all about homeownership.\n\nWe have always known this. The Root has routinely reported on the difficulties black people encounter when buying a home. A recent report by the Center for Investigative Reporting, along with Reveal News, uncovered how U.S. banks systematically prevent blacks and Hispanics from becoming homeowners.\n\nJPMorgan Chase paid $55 million in January to settle charges that it discriminated against black and Latino borrowers. In 2011, Bank of America handed over $335 million for making its minority customers pay more than its white customers for the same loans. A federal lawsuit against Wells Fargo alleges that the bank has discriminated against Philadelphia\u2019s black and Latino borrowers since 2004.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is an indisputable fact that many banks treat their black customers unequally. The only reason we know this is that banks are required to report demographic data on most mortgage loans. That data is publicly available to anyone who wants to look at it.\n\nAmong other things, the legislation passed by the Senate on Wednesday strips away for some banks the requirement to report the race, ethnicity and gender of their mortgage customers. Under the new proposal, only the largest banks will have to report demographic data, which means that it will be impossible to find out if the other banks discriminate. If the law passes, these banks will be able to deny black customers without fear of repercussion or lawsuits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Democratic Party could have singled out that provision to the public and made a fuss. They could have called it racist (because it is racist), which would have made the legislation lose support. They could easily have refused to vote for this bill unless that specific provision was stripped away.\n\nSen. Doug Jones from the state of Alabama voted for it.\n\nThis is the Democratic Party.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: The Democratic Party is only a viable party because of the black vote. In the 2016 election, 88 percent of blacks voted for the Democratic candidate, while only 37 percent of whites voted for Hillary Clinton, according to exit polls by USA Today. Even before the most recent election, according to Pew Research, only 40 percent of whites identified as Democrats.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf not for black voters, there would not be a Democratic Party. Without the black vote, Dems would lose every election at the local, state and national levels. The Democratic Party\u2019s leadership knows this. The Republican Party knows this.\n\nYet Democratic politicians repeatedly refuse to stand up for the issues that affect black people the most. They continue to confirm President Donald Trump\u2019s federal court appointees, who will hear cases of police brutality and voter-ID-law discrimination, despite the fact that he has failed to nominate a single African-American or Latino judge to the federal bench.\n\nThey ignored the suggestion that they filibuster every bill until the Senate and House look at gun control legislation to curb the violence that affects black communities disproportionately. They caved on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals vote during the recent government shutdown. (We often forget how immigration laws disproportionately affect African and Caribbean immigrants.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is the solution?\n\nAs usual, all politics is local. Imagine if\u2014at the local level, which affects us the most\u2014black candidates ran on non-Democratic platforms touting issues that are supported by black voters. In Georgia, there might be the \u201cKeisha\u201d Party, which works on stopping freeways from catching on fire and collapsing. Chicago might have a \u201cTop Gang Thugs\u201d Party.\n\nWhat if we supported valid third-party candidates who aren\u2019t beholden to an agenda beholden to Democratic apologists? What if we\u2014even in one single election\u2014wrote in our own choices? What if we stopped participating in this antiquated, binary system of choices?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis would force the national Democratic Party to engage with and pay attention to black voters and black issues. It would also stop Democrat politicians from appearing in black churches and barbershops only during voting season, and pretending that black voters don\u2019t exist in the intervening periods.\n\nOf course, there is the argument that if black voters didn\u2019t support the Democratic Party, Republicans would take over.

It tells the story of Josiah X, a black man who doesn\u2019t care about being a hero despite a past intertwined with the experiments that turned Steve Rogers into Captain America. Josiah\u2019s life story is like a photo negative of Rogers\u2019, showing him treated like a disposable pawn on the front lines of Vietnam and as a disillusioned veteran in a black militant activist group.

Pacifist scientist Michael Collins found himself trapped in a body designed solely for wreaking havoc, with his family believing him to be dead and his real body stolen by the evil corporation he used to work for.

While facing off against twisted versions of Green Arrow, the Flash, and Aquaman, Cray\u2019s also dealing with a mysterious illness that might be haphazardly altering reality.

In the six-issue series, the reinvented nocturnal avenger brutally retaliated against racist police officers, opportunistic drug dealers, and sleazy real estate developers. There\u2019s a grisly serial killer plotline in the midst of it all, too, pushing Nighthawk into places where very little superhero work is brave enough to tread.

A Complicated Man sees Shaft come home from Vietnam and help his paramour find a missing friend, while Imitation of Life gets slightly metatextual as the detective finds himself hired on as a bodyguard on a movie that\u2019s based on his life.

King relentlessly exposed the three evils of white supremacy, economic exploitation and imperialism\u2014three tenets of the GOP\u2014and all three were weaved into Trump\u2019s words and in the regressive policies that this racist, xenophobic, bigoted administration champions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, I hope that while these white Democrats are (rightfully) calling out their colleagues and friends across the aisle, they don\u2019t abuse this day by not confronting their own complicity in perpetuating white supremacy.\n\nThey should remember that King warned us that the white moderate is arguably more dangerous than the White Citizens\u2019 Councilor or the Ku Klux Klansman. They should remember that he warned us about white moderates who preferred a negative peace, which is the absence of tension, to a positive peace, which is the presence of justice.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey should remember that King called the U.S. government \u201cthe greatest purveyor of violence in the world today\u201d\u2014and that we only have to look to Honduras, Libya, Yemen and the occupied black, brown and indigenous communities right here in this country to know that the same holds true today with the support of the Democratic Party.\n\nIt would serve the Democratic Party well to reckon with its own role in global and state violence. These so-called white liberals at the forefront of \u201cthe resistance\u201d should acknowledge how loud their collective silence is while the most targeted among us continue without access to quality health care or education, while police officers continue to kill black, brown and indigenous people with impunity.

Luckily for me, there's rarely a day that passes without a hot-button issue being debated on one of my many social media timelines.\n\nOver the last couple of weeks, I've spent a great deal of time, perhaps more than usual, \"exchanging ideas\" about issues surrounding Gabrielle Douglas, Nate Parker, Chris Brown, Colin Kaepernick and more. I've noticed some repetitive counterarguments that often derail otherwise substantive conversations. I mean, that is the point, isn't it?\n\nI rounded up a few of the most frequent (and illogical) ways uncomfortable (or sadistic) commenters ruin productive discussions:\n\n\n\n1. \"Why now?\"\n\nThis is the go-to line for Bill Cosby apologists and Parker defenders. They want to know why Cosby's accusers came forward after decades of silence. Or why Parker's rape trial is being discussed now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd I just want to know, \"Why not now?\" You can't be charged with certain alleged crimes after a certain amount of time, but we can't discuss them, either, even when the story is currently in the news cycle? Even when a celebrity sits for interviews about his misdeeds? Should we all consult our calendars for an undefined expiration date before caring or commenting?\n\nIf an alleged victim doesn't speak up immediately, then she should take it to her grave? Is that how this works? If a heinous crime is alleged to have taken place and there's been no past accountability, is time a get-out-of-anyone-having-an-opinion free card?\n\nSomeone let me know. I'm confused.\n\n\n\n2. \"But white people allow it/don't do \u2026 \"\n\nWhite people are not the gold standard. I repeat: White people are not the gold standard. That there are moviegoers who turn a blind eye to Woody Allen or Roman Polanski, or who separate the man from his work of art, isn't a valid reason for black people to look past the shenanigans or crimes allegedly or actually committed by another black person. We ain't gotta \"follow the leader.\" We can think independently and hold black folk accountable when necessary.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. \"Don't judge/Only God can judge.\"\n\nOut of all the responses, this one irritates me the most. To judge, by Merriam-Webster's definition, is to form an opinion or draw a conclusion. We all judge. All of us. All the time. And that includes the \"Don't judge\" people. They just can't articulate a proper argument to defend their point of view, or they're guilty of similar behavior. Instead of admitting that, they get on the moral high horse and try to shame into silence folks who are using their brains. It's sooooo annoying, but rarely works.\n\n\n\n4. \"There are more important topics, like \u2026 \"\n\nIn fairness, discussing the fit or pattern of Cam Newton's pants doesn't compare, in terms of importance, to, say, poverty, racism or rape. But if you see that's the topic of discussion and you think it's wack, why didn't you keep scrolling?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd yes, folks can discuss Cam's pants one minute and #BlackLivesMatter the next. It's not as if folks get one opinion a day and they've wasted it frivolously on fashion.\n\nThis argument is even worse when folks actually are discussing an important topic such as racism or sexism or rape, and someone jumps in to say they should be talking about something else. Without fail, when folks are discussing police brutality, there's always someone who wants the whole discussion to cease and switch to \u201cblack-on-black\u201d crime. Women discussing sexism or rape? There's always that one person who jumps in wanting to talk about black folk uniting to fight the Man instead.\n\nYou passionately feel what you want to talk about needs a voice? Start your own #hashtag or thread so you can be heard.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. \"Y\u2019all just hating.\"\n\nNow, sometimes this one is appropriate, such as when you stumble upon a thread discussing the state of Gabrielle Douglas' hair while she is competing. Other times, this is thrown out because the commenter has a lack of anything intelligent to add to the conversation and a desire to invalidate all naysayers. To quote the great street prophet Common, \"If I don't like it, I don't like it/Doesn't mean that I'm hating.\" If you like something and the person or group you're engaging with doesn't, just state your support and your reasons for enjoying. Or even better, keep scrolling.\n\n\n\n6. \"It's a conspiracy \u2026 \"\n\nThis one drives me nuts, too, but it actually holds some weight right now. That girl who said Chris Brown pulled a gun on her and she had to run for her life, I mean, after she got her phone back? She wasn't in collusion with the feds to take down Brown, but that situation sounds more and more like a setup. Y\u2019all won this round.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I still want to say this: Your favorite celeb who suddenly has been humbled and dragged probably isn't the victim of a conspiracy. It's more likely that a series of bad decisions finally caught up with him or her, and it's harder to bury a story in the age of social media and blogs.\n\n\n\n7. \"It's the woman's fault \u2026 \"\n\nSadly, I've come to expect this from men and women alike when it comes to any form of abuse happening to a woman. But the frequency of this argument and how some folk will apply it to just any situation just baffles me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was part of a conversation recently about the \"media's emasculation of black men\" as inspired by Yung Joc's permed hair and Young Thug's album cover. I don't get the rationale, but I read through the comments to understand the perspective. I stopped when I got to a guy blaming man-perms and men in dresses on women. Apparently, women like and encourage these expressions, and men want to attract women, so if women didn't encourage it, men wouldn't do this.\n\nHuh? Young Thug wants to dress up like Scarlett O'Hara and that's my fault? Naw. That grown man decided to wear that dress. And if he's happy in it, I'm happy for him. But wearing that dress is solely on him.\n\nI find often that it's the most \"I am man, hear me roar, let me lead\"-type guys that refuse to hold other men accountable for anything. It's always, \"A woman made him do it.\" And I always wonder if they realize how weak it makes men sound. Like, if everything you do is because of a woman, you're a follower. Just get out the way, stop yelling about submission, and just let the folks who are already leading go on and do what they do without all the complaining.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBonus: \"You're a Negro bed wench.\"\n\nThis one is reserved for black women who dare to call themselves feminists and/or use words like \"privilege\" and \"misogynoir\" and/or don't rush to defend black men who have found themselves in a media scandal. if you believed the 60 women who accused Cosby of nefarious sexual conduct, thought Nate Parker was anything less than completely innocent or have expressed an unwillingness to attend an R. Kelly concert, you may have found this comment in your social media mentions.\n\nThis is a clear sign of a person who hates black women. There is no reasoning with the speaker, usually a man. Just block and report him for harassment. You're probably not the first person to whom he's said it. Maybe with enough complaints, the social media platform will ban his account and you'll be the last.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDemetria Lucas D\u2019Oyley is a contributing editor at The Root, a life coach and the author of Don\u2019t Waste Your Pretty: The Go-to Guide for Making Smarter Decisions in Life & Love as well as A Belle in Brooklyn: The Go-to Girl for Advice on Living Your Best Single Life.

It is the reason I might be represented in the U.S. Senate by a grown man who probably went to see Twilight in the theaters and stood by the candy counter asking teenage girls if they wanted a sugar daddy.\n\nUntil the stories surfaced about Roy Moore\u2019s predilection for prepubescent ponytail wearers, the Democratic Party had wholly abandoned Alabama. It treated minorities and Democratic-leaning whites in the South like every black character in horror movies: necessary casualties left behind for the greater good.\n\nThe party only campaigns in already-Democratic strongholds for the scant few electoral votes during presidential elections, and the rest of the time it ignores them completely.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the rare occasions when the Democratic Party does address black voters, it only talks about the \u201cblack issues\u201d: policing, mass incarceration, civil rights, etc. For the party leadership, black people aren\u2019t whole people who have the same concerns about taxes, job creation, education initiatives, international policy and economics as other voters. They are simply bodies collected in the coffers of the party\u2019s ineffective longing for power.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re more than civil rights. We\u2019re bigger than fish fries. And we want to be heard.\ufeff\u201d \u2014Edward Bowser, Birmingham, Ala.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow that Dems think Doug Jones has a decent chance to pick up a Senate seat, they have turned to Alabama\u2019s black electorate as if they were in the state the entire time. Furthermore, the only argument they have made in their efforts to convince black voters to vote for Jones is that one thing he did for black people that one time. Every solicitation is the same: \u201cRemember when he convicted the racists who bombed the 16th Street Baptist Church? See? He\u2019s down!\u201d\n\nEdward Bowser, a Birmingham resident, said it best:\n\nMaybe it\u2019s because, like most reasonable, thoughtful Alabamians, I really want Jones to win\u2014and believe me, scandal or not, his victory is far from guaranteed. This state is redder than the bottom of Cardi B\u2019s shoes, after all. But Jones\u2019 campaign has done such a poor job speaking to the black community that my passion has fizzled. Severely. And this isn\u2019t a new predicament. WashPo and other news outlets might now just be picking up on the trend, but black voters have long been discouraged. I appreciate what Doug Jones did in prosecuting KKK members in the deaths of four innocent girls. But when that\u2019s the one and only message of black interest coming from your campaign, it shows an extreme disconnect.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven if they convince us to vote, even if Doug Jones wins, it doesn\u2019t mean Dems are going to go hard for us like the Republicans go hard for their base. The floor of Trump\u2019s core supporters is probably a 25-30 percent, mostly Southern minority. Who does that remind you of?\n\nThe Republican Party wins not only because it caters to its base, but because (and this is the important part) it goes all out in efforts to convince the rest of the mainstream voters to get on board.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you look at the poll numbers, a vast number of Republican voters disagree with their party on gun control, abortion or white supremacy (well, maybe not white supremacy, but still ... ). But the party leadership finds a way to convince them to vote for the party. They talk about job creation, lowering taxes and kitchen-table issues.\n\nTrump will go to a Detroit church and try to change a few minds. The Democratic Party only competes where it knows it will win. Had Hillary Clinton not taken votes for granted in certain states, she might have won the Electoral College. (After you read that sentence, if you listen closely, you can hear a white woman say, \u201cBut she won the popular vote, though ... \u201d)\n\nYet Democrats treat blacks in the South like stepchildren from a previous marriage: They\u2019ll have us over for weekends and election holidays, smile and act nice, but they don\u2019t really do shit for us. They treat the new kids better. The white ones.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSay what you will about the toothless dimwits who buy \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats, but they are getting almost everything they wanted. Trump is rounding up immigrants, normalizing white supremacy, reinstituting the war on drugs, trying his damnedest to keep Muslims out of the country, and he\u2019s still on that bullshit about the wall.\n\n\n\nDemocrats, on the other hand? Trash.\n\nBlack voters are the base of the Democratic Party, and we\u2019re still waiting for Dems to fix the wage gap and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. They aren\u2019t going to listen because they never do. They pocket black votes and black dollars, and take them back to the national party to spend in districts where they know they\u2019re going to win.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis has always been the modus operandi of the party, but it was rescued over the past decade by Barack Obama, a black candidate black voters in the South adored. He mobilized both black and white voters in the South by canvassing, using foot soldiers and going after every vote, even turning some red states blue. Now that he\u2019s gone, the Dems are back on that old shit ... until they need us again.\n\nThe Democratic Party is so white and rigid that the last person to bring any new enthusiasm to the masses was a 187-year-old socialist who sounded like the aardvark from the Pink Panther cartoons and never really claimed the party.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfrican Americans in the South register more often and are more likely to cast ballots than anywhere else in the country. Yet the Democratic Party squanders the opportunity to make meaningful gains among whites, moderates and apathetic blacks.\n\nAccording to the U.S. census, Alabama\u2019s voting-age population is 26 percent black. Black voters in Alabama (and the Deep South as a whole) tend to skew more conservative on social issues. If the Democratic Party focused on running candidates that aligned with the party\u2019s values while not so stringently adhering to the national party\u2019s platform, it could rally enthusiasm among black voters and steal some white votes, too. While not ideal, moderate candidates who could caucus with Democrats would be better than no candidates at all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlabama is the perfect example. The recent contentious mayoral election in Birmingham excited the entire electorate in one of the blackest cities in the country. Even though blacks were out in droves, the party didn\u2019t use it to push the state Senate race. But you know ... despite the rhetoric about diversity and inclusion, the Democratic National Committee is still a predominantly white institution.\n\n\n\nIf you look at the names of the faces of Democratic leadership, it\u2019s not noticeably different from that of the GOP. Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer and the darling of the left\u2014Elizabeth Warren\u2014are old, white rich people from the coasts. Had it not been for a Russian hacking, the head of the DNC would still be lil\u2019 Debbie Wasserman Schultz.\n\nThe Democratic Party is so white and rigid that the last person to bring any new enthusiasm to the masses was a 187-year-old socialist who sounded like the aardvark from the Pink Panther cartoons and never really claimed the party.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause I am a registered Democrat, a few days ago I received a call from Doug Jones\u2019 campaign. The only issues the caller spoke of were the accusations surrounding Moore and Jones\u2019 seemingly singular accomplishment. As Bowser put it:\n\nWe know Roy Moore is a monster, a total embarrassment to our state. But in the eyes of black voters, what makes him more of a monster than the parade of sleazy politicians who have stood against black interests for generations? So yes, I\u2019m voting for Doug Jones but only because it\u2019s a vote against Roy Moore. And that\u2019s not good enough to rally a base of voters who are already stricken with apathy. We\u2019re more than civil rights. We\u2019re bigger than fish fries. And we want to be heard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust like for this country, the black vote is the lifeblood of the Democratic Party. But party leaders don\u2019t respect it; nor do they appreciate it. They take it for granted. They treat black voters and their Southern constituency the way America treats music, culture, art and the entire economy upon which this country was built:\n\nAmerica loves everything black ...\n\nBlack people?

That is how long I\u2019ve been sick with an unknown virus (the thing doctors tell you when they don\u2019t know what it is but know it won\u2019t kill you). It\u2019s not the flu. It\u2019s not a cold. But it is one thing\u2014a jerk. Just the biggest jerk of a disease ruining my social life by forcing me to be actually antisocial, much like the name of this column.\n\nAntisocial is the events-and-society column for people allergic to society, aka those with social anxiety disorder, so it\u2019s not as if I needed an actual disease to give me a reason to stay home. I come up with plenty of excuses to stay in the house\u2014it\u2019s too hot, it\u2019s too cold, it\u2019s too \u201coutside\u201d\u2014whatever works. But I had actually been looking forward to the spate of events I had lined up over the last two weeks to crash. Page Six TV\u2019s party. A YouTube-Elle Magazine function. So many Congressional Black Caucus Foundation Annual Legislative Conference panels and events in Washington, D.C. All missed because I was too busy hacking and coughing in my prison of used Kleenex.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is my first time being ill in more than two years, ruining my pristine streak of good health, all of which was fueled (mostly) by a flu shot I took back in 2015 and some really good luck, considering that New York City is a germophobe\u2019s nightmare fuel. I\u2019m supposed to travel back to D.C. later this week for my 40th birthday, but the way this sickness is going, who knows what will happen come Friday? Can I even travel? I could\u2019ve almost died in my hotel room during CBC week because I choked on a cold tablet that got lodged in my throat.\n\n\n\nIn the middle of my more than 18 days of sinus infection, I decided to take a break from being sick and pretended to be well because I didn\u2019t want to miss the Black & White Champagne Brunch with the New York Urban League at La Marina in New York City on Sept. 16.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbout 200 people gathered for the brunch, which was hosted by actress and body-positive advocate RaVal Davis. Charter Communications Vice President of State Government Affairs Camile Joseph Goldman was being honored with the David N. Dinkins Award for Service, Leadership and Social Justice at the event, which also featured performances by NAACP Theater Award-winning actress and singer Sha\u2019Leah Nikole.\n\nShe performed Roberta Flack\u2019s classic by way of the Fugees, \u201cKilling Me Softly,\u201d as I ate eggs and bacon, feeling proud of my ability to actually throw together a halfway decent outfit that didn\u2019t make me feel that I unnecessarily stood out in a bad way, but still blended in with the overall theme of everyone in black and white.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRemarks were made by NYUL President and CEO Arva R. Rice and Rep. Adriano Espaillat (D-N.Y.), as well as Goldman, who gave a spirited and impassioned speech.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was mostly thankful that it wasn\u2019t a dreaded \u201cwhite party\u201d (black people love white parties, where you dress in all white, get turnt and look like drunken angels), because I hate wearing all white with a passion. The absence of color does nothing for my complexion and is almost as dreaded as wearing all black, which makes me look like I (still) work at Macy\u2019s.\n\n\n\nPer usual, I had no business cards on me because they were still in the mail at the time and my old cards were lost more than a year ago in my move to New York City. (They did show up in time for CBC week, meaning that a bunch of people now have my work number, filling me with a special kind of anxiety.)\n\nThis made me garner a look from New York society columnist Audrey J. Bernard, whom I\u2019d watched chastise a young woman who approached me a few weeks ago at a New York Fashion Week event wanting to write for The Root and had no business cards. To be honest, I find that when I receive business cards, I never do absolutely anything with them unless the person is someone I\u2019m desperately, constantly forgetting the name of. Then I hold on to the card as if I\u2019m hoping the name will be absorbed into my porous brain.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m notoriously bad with names. Chances are, if you know me and I know you but we\u2019re not close enough to be besties, I don\u2019t actually know your name even though I\u2019ve met you several times, seen you at multiple events and recognize you easily. I used to have a publisher, Virginia Moorhouse\u2014whose family owns the Bakersfield Californian newspaper, where I worked for five years\u2014who was fantastic at remembering everyone\u2019s name, an incredible, enviable skill.\n\nI try all the tricks, repeating the name back to them, introducing them to friends so they have to say their name\u2014nothing really works except for this one time when I ran into a guy (who also probably didn\u2019t know my name, either, to be honest) in the airport and I remembered his entire life story but not his name, so I went home and furiously Googled his job and searched for his name and picture until it popped up, then just kept walking around my apartment, repeating the name back to myself like a lunatic.\n\nWhich brings me to CBC in Washington, where I was talking to Very Smart Brothas\u2019 Panama Jackson, a senior editor here at The Root, and he was also complaining about how he knew no one\u2019s name. How he would know people, kick it with people at parties and still have no idea what they\u2019re called. He wondered if something was wrong with him or if he was just self-centered.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI told him I was the same way and that he was likely just self-centered, since I\u2019m sure that is my issue. I\u2019m often too busy thinking about whatever the personal malady of the day is to know what anyone\u2019s name is, lost in my own head. I may be present with you in the moment, talking, smiling, laughing, but am I really there? Or am I lost in my own head, wondering about this and that? It\u2019s annoying and probably one of my least favorite things about myself. I want to be in the moment, but I\u2019m easily distracted by my own internal drama.\n\nEvery year for the past 47 years, the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation has thrown a conference in D.C. that attracts thousands of black people from across the nation to talk policy and community issues, then fight to get into many of the exclusive parties going on around the main event. I was too sick for most of the conference, barely making it through panels\u2014faring poorly with a panel The Root\u2019s Jason Johnson and Panama were on about the importance of the black press, but faring a bit better during a panel on the film Black Panther that featured director Ryan Coogler and an exclusive five-minute clip from the film.\n\nI spent most of the conference just trying not to die, but managed to pull it together for a discussion between St. Louis\u2019 own, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) (she\u2019s from Kinloch, Mo., to be precise), and BET\u2019s newest late-night talk show host, Robin Thede, soon to be starring in The Rundown With Robin Thede.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was excited to attend this event and to meet Robin because we have something in common: We were both black-lady head writers for late-night talk shows\u2014she is formerly of Larry Wilmore\u2019s show on Comedy Central, and I am formerly of BET\u2019s previous late-night outing Don\u2019t Sleep Hosted by T.J. Holmes.\n\nMy foray into late-night TV was very (very!) short-lived. The show lasted only four months back in 2012. T.J. has since moved on to Good Morning America on ABC, and I\u2019m obviously here at The Root, holding it down. I wished Robin all the best with her show (and told her I\u2019d love to do a feature on her for The Root), and judging by how well she handled her interview with Waters\u2014it was funny and insightful\u2014I have a feeling she might last much, much longer than our four months of ratings-based struggle! (But we did get this sweet write-up in the New York Times!)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for all the other activities that happened during CBC, I left all of those for everyone else to enjoy, since I spent nearly every night in my hotel room quietly wondering why I traveled to D.C. while sick on a germ-filled Amtrak train, resickening myself and making my illness worse. I left all the real partying to my friend Jason, who did all the things I would have done had I been well\u2014like be bold enough to crash parties I wasn\u2019t invited to in order to see T.I. and Babyface perform at separate galas. I ended up giving away my ticket to the coveted Black Party (hosted by La La Anthony and featuring Doug E. Fresh) to my best friend, Jada Prather, so I could go back to my hotel and die.\n\nSpeaking of dying, I almost did! The following morning, I attempted to take some cold medication and choked on the pill. It got caught up in my throat and would NOT dislodge despite all the coughing, hacking and vomiting I did. Fearing that I would die, I called the front desk and attempted to tell them, \u201cSend help, I\u2019m choking!\u201d For some reason, they misinterpreted this but did send up a gentleman who, upon looking at me hacking and coughing with mucus running from my nose, took off running in the other direction, shouting on his walkie-talkie to the front desk. I was hoping he\u2019d help me out with a Heimlich or something, but no.\n\nSo I was left gagging and contemplating whether this was the end. That the sum of my life would conclude with me asphyxiating on a very large DayQuil gel cap, in a T-shirt and underwear, in a hotel room in D.C. All I kept thinking was, \u201cThis is a stupid, stupid way to die.\u201d I also thought a lot about the HBO show Six Feet Under, which had an episode once in which a woman choked to death on food in her apartment, and how I always feared this happening to me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo I thought about dying, my father, Six Feet Under and how dumb this was. A dumb way to die. I couldn\u2019t die like this. I had to calm down and attempt to breath through all the coughing and heaving so I wouldn\u2019t black out.\n\nAfter what felt like forever, the pill started to break down and dissolve in my throat, probably from all the vomiting of stomach acid (it was very early in the morning and I hadn\u2019t eaten yet). The hotel sent several more people up to my room to check on me, including the paramedics, who had been told that someone \u201cfell.\u201d I was like, \u201cNah, I was choking.\u201d So the paramedics cracked a few jokes and left.\n\nAfter everyone determined that no one had died at the Hyatt Place in \u201cNoMa\u201d (lol at that name), I was left to my own devices, whereupon I sat in my room and cried until Jason called me and invited me to breakfast, where I recounted to him my brush with death in a hoarse voice that could barely get out words.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere, I ate this Breakfast Bandit bagel sandwich at Buffalo & Bergen in Union Market.\n\nIt was delicious, but I was still teary and miserable, and I wanted to document the first thing I attempted to eat after almost dying.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeemed important.\n\nThankfully, I am not dead, but still on the mend from my illness. I have a whole spate of events lined up in October that I will hopefully be much more healthy and present for. Hopefully. Maybe. Perhaps.

Her rich roots and passion for culinary arts were inspired by cooking with her grandmother at a very young age; years later, she\u2019d moonlight in the hospitality industry after earning credentials from Eastern Michigan University to be a social worker.\n\n\u201cI always worked at least two jobs, and if one of them was cooking, I was very happy,\u201d says Scott.\n\nAfter getting laid off from her position as a social worker\u2014and eventually hitting rock bottom\u2014she explored opportunities in the culinary field.\n\n\u201cI cannot say that [culinary] was really my choice; it was very organic. The only other thing I loved was food and cooking. I lost my home, car, everything\u2014that\u2019s how my first real cooking job came about. I decided to work on a major cruise line.\u201d\n\nFour years after her full-time transition into the hospitality industry, Scott enrolled in culinary school\u2014and quickly learned how complicated the business can be. An internship with the Food Network provided her initial exposure to culinary media, food styling and networking with established peers, eventually allowing her to gain culinary clients of her own.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShortly after, she pursued her master\u2019s degree in entertainment business from Full Sail University and transitioned into a career as a culinary producer: a multifaceted position that dabbles in all areas on set to run a smooth production. Her experience now includes being the culinary producer of season 2 of Bravo\u2019s hit television show Chef Roble and Company, Throwdown With Bobby Flay and the Cooking Channel.\n\nProgressing her way through a multilayered industry, she landed more exceptional positions, working alongside The Chew\u2019s Carla Hall at the Barbados Food, Wine and Rum Festival and becoming a food stylist for Michael Symon and Daphne Oz.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlossoming in the culinary industry has been a blessing, but despite her qualifications, Scott has experienced disappointment in the field she loves, being passed up for many opportunities. She explains:\n\nI vividly remember being called by the hiring manager of a major network with excitement in her voice, [calling me] the \u201cperfect candidate.\u201d I was told that I\u2019d be moving to the next round of interviews, and then I didn\u2019t get a call back. Inquiring about the follow-up, I was met with her less-than-enthusiastic\u2014almost bothered\u2014tone. The job was given to a young woman who just finished her internship\u2014she was white. That\u2019s just one example, and there are quite a few\u2014each one heartbreaking and disconcerting. The takeaway for me was that when something new or different is happening, it\u2019s always met with resistance. I always knew that it was my personal mission to end these cycles by breaking down these barriers. I later learned that like any building, there\u2019s ways to get in other than the front door; I began to curate my career, diversify my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and make myself marketable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd she did\u2014Scott is the founder of SheChef, a culinary mentorship and leadership program for aspiring women chefs and professionals.\n\nIn a male-dominated industry, chef Elle noted that food styling and culinary production are not. \u201cThese are probably two of few areas dominated by women, [but] women of color remain a minority in these areas.\u201d She cites culinary producers like like Ma\u2019at Zachary and owners of Powerhouse Productions Rochelle Brown and Sonia Armstead as excellent examples in the industry, while Rosecleer-Marie Powell and Sade Aguila are two of many slaying the food styling game.\n\nBut Scott\u2019s rise in the culinary world was interrupted by her diagnosis with stage 1C, grade 3 ovarian cancer\u2014a cancerous tumor resting on her right ovary. Enduring six rounds of chemotherapy over a five-month period and laparoscopic surgery removing her ovary and right fallopian tube, she experienced emotional and physical changes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI dealt with perpetual nausea but never once vomited, extreme fatigue and worked all about a total of eight days within that five-month period,\u201d she says. \u201cI was on a large amount of steroids, getting medication\u2014Taxol and Carboplatin\u2014intravenously and gained 23 pounds that I\u2019m still struggling to lose. I couldn\u2019t eat much unless it was salty; lost all of my hair, even my eyelashes.

It is an actual flyer circulating around from the Doug Jones for Senate Committee in his run against Elmer Fudd wannabe and schoolgirl aficionado Roy Moore for Alabama\u2019s U.S. Senate seat, and it has upset black voters across Alabama.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSomeone, probably a white man, thought that the image would resonate with black people and motivate them to get out the vote. It\u2019s as if black people were considering voting for the child molester until some brilliant strategist posited, \u201cWhat if he were black, though?\u201d The flyer is reductive in its oversimplification of the black mind as only caring about black issues. While it might not be racist, it is certainly racist adjacent.\n\n\n\nIt is also the Democratic Party.\n\nPart of the reason the Democratic Party has been marginalized as a party that only exists on the coasts and in urban areas is white-mannery like this. While the policies of the party may be more progressive and black-friendly, the Democratic leadership is often as prejudiced and shortsighted as its Republican counterparts, and next week\u2019s Senate election is the perfect example.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Democratic Party is trash. It is the reason Hillary Clinton lost. It is the reason Donald Trump is president. It is the reason I might be represented in the U.S. Senate by a grown man who probably went to see Twilight in the theaters and stood by the candy counter asking teenage girls if they wanted a sugar daddy.\n\nUntil the stories surfaced about Roy Moore\u2019s predilection for prepubescent ponytail wearers, the Democratic Party had wholly abandoned Alabama. It treated minorities and Democratic-leaning whites in the South like every black character in horror movies: necessary casualties left behind for the greater good.\n\nThe party only campaigns in already-Democratic strongholds for the scant few electoral votes during presidential elections, and the rest of the time it ignores them completely.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the rare occasions when the Democratic Party does address black voters, it only talks about the \u201cblack issues\u201d: policing, mass incarceration, civil rights, etc. For the party leadership, black people aren\u2019t whole people who have the same concerns about taxes, job creation, education initiatives, international policy and economics as other voters. They are simply bodies collected in the coffers of the party\u2019s ineffective longing for power.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re more than civil rights. We\u2019re bigger than fish fries. And we want to be heard.\ufeff\u201d \u2014Edward Bowser, Birmingham, Ala.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow that Dems think Doug Jones has a decent chance to pick up a Senate seat, they have turned to Alabama\u2019s black electorate as if they were in the state the entire time. Furthermore, the only argument they have made in their efforts to convince black voters to vote for Jones is that one thing he did for black people that one time. Every solicitation is the same: \u201cRemember when he convicted the racists who bombed the 16th Street Baptist Church? See? He\u2019s down!\u201d\n\nEdward Bowser, a Birmingham resident, said it best:\n\nMaybe it\u2019s because, like most reasonable, thoughtful Alabamians, I really want Jones to win\u2014and believe me, scandal or not, his victory is far from guaranteed. This state is redder than the bottom of Cardi B\u2019s shoes, after all. But Jones\u2019 campaign has done such a poor job speaking to the black community that my passion has fizzled. Severely. And this isn\u2019t a new predicament. WashPo and other news outlets might now just be picking up on the trend, but black voters have long been discouraged. I appreciate what Doug Jones did in prosecuting KKK members in the deaths of four innocent girls. But when that\u2019s the one and only message of black interest coming from your campaign, it shows an extreme disconnect.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven if they convince us to vote, even if Doug Jones wins, it doesn\u2019t mean Dems are going to go hard for us like the Republicans go hard for their base. The floor of Trump\u2019s core supporters is probably a 25-30 percent, mostly Southern minority. Who does that remind you of?\n\nThe Republican Party wins not only because it caters to its base, but because (and this is the important part) it goes all out in efforts to convince the rest of the mainstream voters to get on board.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you look at the poll numbers, a vast number of Republican voters disagree with their party on gun control, abortion or white supremacy (well, maybe not white supremacy, but still ... ). But the party leadership finds a way to convince them to vote for the party. They talk about job creation, lowering taxes and kitchen-table issues.\n\nTrump will go to a Detroit church and try to change a few minds. The Democratic Party only competes where it knows it will win. Had Hillary Clinton not taken votes for granted in certain states, she might have won the Electoral College. (After you read that sentence, if you listen closely, you can hear a white woman say, \u201cBut she won the popular vote, though ... \u201d)\n\nYet Democrats treat blacks in the South like stepchildren from a previous marriage: They\u2019ll have us over for weekends and election holidays, smile and act nice, but they don\u2019t really do shit for us. They treat the new kids better. The white ones.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSay what you will about the toothless dimwits who buy \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats, but they are getting almost everything they wanted. Trump is rounding up immigrants, normalizing white supremacy, reinstituting the war on drugs, trying his damnedest to keep Muslims out of the country, and he\u2019s still on that bullshit about the wall.\n\n\n\nDemocrats, on the other hand? Trash.\n\nBlack voters are the base of the Democratic Party, and we\u2019re still waiting for Dems to fix the wage gap and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. They aren\u2019t going to listen because they never do. They pocket black votes and black dollars, and take them back to the national party to spend in districts where they know they\u2019re going to win.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis has always been the modus operandi of the party, but it was rescued over the past decade by Barack Obama, a black candidate black voters in the South adored. He mobilized both black and white voters in the South by canvassing, using foot soldiers and going after every vote, even turning some red states blue. Now that he\u2019s gone, the Dems are back on that old shit ... until they need us again.\n\nThe Democratic Party is so white and rigid that the last person to bring any new enthusiasm to the masses was a 187-year-old socialist who sounded like the aardvark from the Pink Panther cartoons and never really claimed the party.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfrican Americans in the South register more often and are more likely to cast ballots than anywhere else in the country. Yet the Democratic Party squanders the opportunity to make meaningful gains among whites, moderates and apathetic blacks.\n\nAccording to the U.S. census, Alabama\u2019s voting-age population is 26 percent black. Black voters in Alabama (and the Deep South as a whole) tend to skew more conservative on social issues. If the Democratic Party focused on running candidates that aligned with the party\u2019s values while not so stringently adhering to the national party\u2019s platform, it could rally enthusiasm among black voters and steal some white votes, too. While not ideal, moderate candidates who could caucus with Democrats would be better than no candidates at all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlabama is the perfect example. The recent contentious mayoral election in Birmingham excited the entire electorate in one of the blackest cities in the country. Even though blacks were out in droves, the party didn\u2019t use it to push the state Senate race. But you know ... despite the rhetoric about diversity and inclusion, the Democratic National Committee is still a predominantly white institution.\n\n\n\nIf you look at the names of the faces of Democratic leadership, it\u2019s not noticeably different from that of the GOP. Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer and the darling of the left\u2014Elizabeth Warren\u2014are old, white rich people from the coasts. Had it not been for a Russian hacking, the head of the DNC would still be lil\u2019 Debbie Wasserman Schultz.\n\nThe Democratic Party is so white and rigid that the last person to bring any new enthusiasm to the masses was a 187-year-old socialist who sounded like the aardvark from the Pink Panther cartoons and never really claimed the party.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause I am a registered Democrat, a few days ago I received a call from Doug Jones\u2019 campaign. The only issues the caller spoke of were the accusations surrounding Moore and Jones\u2019 seemingly singular accomplishment. As Bowser put it:\n\nWe know Roy Moore is a monster, a total embarrassment to our state. But in the eyes of black voters, what makes him more of a monster than the parade of sleazy politicians who have stood against black interests for generations? So yes, I\u2019m voting for Doug Jones but only because it\u2019s a vote against Roy Moore. And that\u2019s not good enough to rally a base of voters who are already stricken with apathy. We\u2019re more than civil rights. We\u2019re bigger than fish fries. And we want to be heard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust like for this country, the black vote is the lifeblood of the Democratic Party. But party leaders don\u2019t respect it; nor do they appreciate it. They take it for granted. They treat black voters and their Southern constituency the way America treats music, culture, art and the entire economy upon which this country was built:\n\nAmerica loves everything black ...\n\nBlack people?

Can a political party toss over $1 billion into the trash two election cycles in a row? Does it really take a genius to figure out that if a group votes for you 90 percent of the time, you should do what it takes to make sure that group is at the polling place on Election Day?\n\n\n\nBoth Hillary Clinton and Jon Ossoff, a Democrat who ran for Congress out of Georgia\u2019s 6th District and lost, taught us that no amount of money can eclipse the power of votes. Clinton\u2019s campaign spent over $1.2 billion to lose. A harder look at the numbers reveals that blacks stayed home in Michigan and Pennsylvania. And in Georgia, Ossoff spent over $20 million and lost.\n\nThe hard fact is that the Democratic Party has no history of taking the strategic advice of African-American elected officials, leaders or consultants and applying substantial financial backing to black voter outreach. Will new Democratic National Committee Deputy Chair Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) be listened to? Who knows.\n\nIf past is prologue, everyone knows what happens next: Senior black officials asking the party for field help will be ignored, and instead, Democrats will stage a few visits to black churches two Sundays before Election Day, followed by that crash panic of activity days before Election Day.\n\nIt was white women who gave 53 percent support to Donald Trump. It was Hispanic voters who gave Trump 29 percent of their support. African Americans voted for Clinton at 93 percent. You\u2019d think that lots of energy to get that group out would be common sense after black women were No. 1 in turnout percentage of any voting group.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn May 25, a group of female African-American elected officials, activists and others wrote an open letter to DNC Chair Tom Perez. They knew to make it \u201copen\u201d because had they written it without it being open, the DNC would have pretended that it didn\u2019t exist. They wrote:\n\n\n\nBlack women cast a total of 11.4 million ballots, providing the margin he needed to win. This past November, even with a clear lack of voter mobilization investment and a decrease in overall Black voter turnout, 94 percent of Black women voted to keep this country moving forward by casting ballots for Hillary Clinton.\n\nShouldn\u2019t that be obvious? Black turnout dove to 2004 levels in 2016 after Democrats decided that the record numbers seen in 2008 and 2012 would magically persist without President Barack Obama on the ticket.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn June 28, Perez met with many of the group of black women who wrote to him about black-voter outreach. The results were predictable: general talk of \u201ca good beginning\u201d and \u201cgive us a plan of action and we\u2019ll meet again.\u201d Even when presented with a clear list of demands and long-standing data to support the importance of the black vote, Democrats still place their focus elsewhere.\n\nOn June 29, a day after Perez met with the black women who wrote him on the need for focused and targeted black-voter effort, House Majority PAC, the largest super PAC focused on House races, announced a major research project to study \u201cwhite working-class voters.\u201d\n\nThere were over 130,000 African Americans in South Carolina\u2019s 5th Congressional District. Did the Democratic Party attempt to make a vigorous effort to turn them out? No. More than 90 percent of African-American voters vote for the Democratic Party. Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.) asked for $200,000 to get out that vote. The answer was no.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn June 22, The Root asked Clyburn if he could remember a time when the Democratic Party has listened to blacks on strategy.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t really thought about that,\u201d said Clyburn, with a smile in an ornate lobby off of the House floor. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t this time,\u201d he added.\n\nClyburn will turn 77 next month and has been in Congress since 1993. If Democrats in charge of strategic decisions aren\u2019t listing to him when it comes to black-voter outreach, who are they listening to? Speaking with several other senior black Democrats reveals the same scenario.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEvery dollar spent wooing Republicans is money flushed down the drain,\u201d stated Steve Phillips of Democracy in Color on the Georgia 6th Congressional District race. Phillips is urging the Democratic Party to focus on its base and not Trump\u2019s \u201cwhite working-class voters\u201d who have become the party\u2019s obsession. Let\u2019s see if anyone listens going into 2018. Or will there be another \u201cbillion-dollar blunder,\u201d as Phillips defined it, like in 2016?\n\nDays after Phillips released his report on June 23, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee announced that Rep. Cheri Bustos (D-Ill.) would lead an effort to focus on Trump voters in a new role as \u201cchair of heartland engagement.\u201d The effort will focus on doing \u201ca better job of listening to the hardworking families from small towns and rural communities.\u201d\n\nDemocrats have lost over 900 state legislative seats since 2008. They lost 63 U.S. House seats in 2010, along with six U.S. Senate seats. The same decision-makers then are the same now. You\u2019d think that all that losing would prompt a rush to listen to other strategies coming from Steve Phillips or Cornell Belcher.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRepublicans know the numbers and understand that their road to victory includes making it harder for members of the Democratic base to vote. Where\u2019s the DNC\u2019s anti-suppression campaign? Where\u2019s the get-out-the-vote effort to target black voters? Where\u2019s the census strategy?\n\n\u201cWe have to raise our own money and make our own decisions,\u201d said Congressional Black Caucus PAC Chair Greg Meeks (D-N.Y.) as he walked to the CBC\u2019s weekly meeting the day before. That\u2019s an understatement.\n\nDemocrats are proving cycle after cycle that you can have all the money in the world, but if you\u2019re a loser on messaging and vote targeting, it\u2019s a waste. Democrats fell asleep on their local state legislature strategy. And the GOP was able to carve up more Republican seats after the 2010 census.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere have been recent efforts to control the game. New efforts like The Collective and Higher Heights have specifically targeted African-American candidates as young activists get tired of waiting for the Democratic Party to confront the reality of the new American majority.

I barely pay attention to those reports because 1) I do not invest in the stock market presently, and 2) numbers and I go together about as well as Future and his baby mamas. It frankly sounded like some rich-people shit, and while I aspire to overcome my student loan debt and join the tax bracket I feel is my destiny, I try to fight in my weight class until I get my weight up.\n\n\n\nHowever, in recent months I have been given unsolicited intel about the cryptocurrency from a source both online and offline: niggas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNiggas like my barber.

She\u2019s literally been all over the TV with her political tell-all, Hacks: The Inside Story of the Break-Ins and Breakdowns That Put Donald Trump in the White House, which debuted at No. 6 on the coveted New York Times best-seller list.\n\n\n\nBut Sunday afternoon, she was in Atlanta, in an intimate black-owned art gallery dedicated to black art, speaking with Atlanta-based attorney, former radio personality and recently defeated Atlanta City Council candidate Mo Ivory about the book that has rung the alarm in every white bastion of the Democratic Party, as well as with black Democratic supporters. People, black and white, haven\u2019t hesitated to call Brazile out for what they consider half-truths or outright lies. When was the last time Gayle King had a heated on-air exchange with a CBS This Morning guest?\n\nWith so much heat, why wouldn\u2019t Brazile retreat to the nation\u2019s reigning Chocolate City? Rachelle O\u2019Neil, a staffer for Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), actually organized the intimate book signing in downtown Atlanta, just walking distance from the new Mercedes-Benz Stadium that some see as the long arm of gentrification.\n\nIn this crowd, Brazile could be as bold as she dared to be, and was met with cheers, not jeers. And after years of being in the shadows and towing the perfect party line, Brazile let loose. She spoke up and loud, letting the crowd know who she was and still is and exactly the pivotal role she\u2019s played in the Democratic Party, especially as it pertains to ensuring diversity. She let be known her impact\u2014especially as it related to the Democrats\u2019 Super Tuesday victories a few weeks ago\u2014on the party\u2019s past and its future.\n\n\u201cJust a few weeks ago, I was in Virginia. I was in Virginia,\u201d she shared. \u201cWhen people said that Justin Fairfax would not have the money to run, Donna Brazile stepped up to raise money. Most people don\u2019t know that he was one of my kids. I recruited him to work for Tipper Gore back in 2000. He\u2019s now lieutenant governor.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen she pointed to another potential gubernatorial victory in 2018. \u201cSetti Warren is running for governor [of Massachusetts]\u2014my kid,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI have watched people just come out of nowhere telling people who I am,\u201d she quipped, taking a tip from Jay-Z and kindly reintroducing herself. \u201cThey would have never been able to back Barack Obama had there not been a Donna Brazile and many others,\u201d she schooled.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t step on me when I tell you my story,\u201d she challenged. \u201cWhere were you when no one knew who Barack Obama was?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrazile didn\u2019t shy away from the material in her book, either, commenting on everything from Hillary Clinton to Bernie Sanders and even, gingerly, on the beloved Barack Obama. She spoke about the Russian hacking and fearing for her own life, even now. Brazile shared that, just recently, someone tried to break into her hotel room in New York City. She revealed that she suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and was undergoing treatment.\n\nShe spent a lot of time on cybersecurity, as well as addressing corruption with the Democratic National Committee, acknowledging that she found that there were folks who never showed up for work making as much as $25,000 after she took over last summer. She told the crowd that she named names. But as much as she ragged on her party, she also stood up for it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a Democrat because my party has stood up for me. They have fought for me. They fought for my voting rights. So I\u2019m giving it back because I\u2019m going to pay it forward. But just because I\u2019m giving it back and paying it forward, don\u2019t treat me like a Patsey. I\u2019m not Patsey,\u201d she warned, referring to Lupita Nyong\u2019o\u2019s Oscar-winning role in 12 Years a Slave.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking to The Root privately as she signed books before heading off to her flight, Brazile couldn\u2019t contain her excitement about the recent election of LaToya Cantrell in her hometown of New Orleans.\n\n\u201cI spent the weekend in Louisiana, had a chance to go home to New Orleans to watch history being made with the election of LaToya Cantrell as the first female mayor,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cShe now follows in the footsteps of Sharon Weston Broome in Baton Rouge and Ollie Tyler in Shreveport. So Louisiana has at least three out of the four largest cities [where] we have black female mayors,\u201d she bragged.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI feel like we\u2019re in a period of awakening where people are discovering not just their own political power, but they have determined that the best way to proceed in the 21st century is to get more and more Americans to run for office. So I\u2019m excited about this moment. Perhaps more excited than in 2008 when we elected Barack Obama,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd, as for her future within the Democratic Party, Brazile assured The Root that she is not worried: \u201cI\u2019ve been a Democrat all my life, but more importantly than a Democrat, I have been an activist. I\u2019ve been an activist for American democracy. I have organized voter-registration campaigns. I\u2019ve recruited people to run for office. I still have a seat at the table. No one can move my seat.\n\n\u201cBut even if they tried, I would bring up a folding chair and reopen the doors,\u201d she promised. \u201cEvery time I\u2019ve gotten involved, I\u2019ve brought others in the room. And so I maintain my seat, and I\u2019m going to continue to speak my truth.\u201d", "keywords": ["brazile", "donna", "step", "dont", "barack", "tell", "party", "white", "obama", "im", "atlanta", "run", "democratic", "black", "ive"], "polarity": 0.13511271833189642, "subjectivity": 0.38288070377111477},

The multidimensional author of A Beautiful Work in Progress has been making her way around the internet\u2014and on the pavement.\n\nRecently, she was featured in a J.C. Penney campaign with yogi Jessamyn Stanley as well as in a now-viral video with REI, where she reads an ugly email from an anonymous troll who accuses her of not being a runner because she\u2019s overweight. As director of equity and inclusion at Rabun Gap Nacoochee School, the Mirnavator\u2014a pseudonym to almost 30,000 Instagram followers\u2014wears many hats: Spanish instructor, cross-country coach and even, utilizing her Juilliard background, a chorus director; that is, when she\u2019s not beating down the trails or doing a Tough Mudder.\n\n\n\nFor those unfamiliar with her story, Valerio has consistently defied the stereotypes of what an ultrarunner looks like, while being featured by the Wall Street Journal, Runner\u2019s World, NBC Nightly News and CNN.\n\nMany have questioned if she can truly be both \u201cfat and fit\u201d while tackling courses like the Javelina Jundred and the TransRockies Run\u2014a whopping 62.13 and 120 miles, respectively. As she recounts in her book, her passion for fitness dates to her youth; but it was ultimately a health scare that gave her the jump start back into running.\n\n\u201cI was driving through the middle of Pennsylvania when I started getting chest pains, and thought I was having a heart attack,\u201d Valerio told HuffPost in October.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThankfully, it was a false alarm, but she followed up with a cardiologist who advised her to change her lifestyle or else she would die, leaving behind her son. During this period of her life, she was working around the clock, under high stress, with no relief, and not exercising. Her health scare pushed her to begin documenting her running journey with the public, sharing everything from her experiences of night running to talking about her fitness endeavors as a plus-size woman sometimes coming in DFL\u2014\u201ddead fucking last\u201d\u2014at trail races.\n\nAs a fellow runner and friend, I\u2019ve had the pleasure of celebrating an annual New Year\u2019s Day hike at Anthony\u2019s Nose with Valerio. This year, I couldn\u2019t help but ask a multitude of questions, wondering what sparked her to write her memoirs while also trying to balance her private life, teaching, training for the Boston Marathon and touring.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cActually, there is no balance; it\u2019s sort of a myth,\u201d she joked.\n\nThe boarding school where she works has been exceptionally accommodating to her ever-changing schedule, allowing her to maintain employment on a flexible schedule\u2014and allowing her teenage son to stay on campus while she tours several states.\n\nAlthough flattered by the media attention, she says she wanted to tell her own story of how she started her journey. So, since her October 2017 book launch, Merrell and REI have teamed up to help Valerio conduct a multicity sold-out book tour, allowing her to engage with thousands of people from Seattle to New York City.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdmittedly, amid the the waves of support from fans praising her astonishing accolades, she\u2019s consistently had to remind herself about self-care:\n\nWhen I was on the Rich Roll podcast, I had to put my phone down, because all day, I was getting a ton of messages and DMs on Instagram, on Twitter and all of my Facebook pages.\n\nTypically, it\u2019s questions like \u201cWow, how did you get started?\u201d But the Merrell, Skirt Sports and Swiftwick Socks ambassador noted that there are times the questions get tough. Although she strives to answer every message, she hopes that living in her truth will serve as an unspoken example for others to pursue their passions despite shape, size, disability or background:\n\nIt\u2019s cool knowing that people reach out and share themselves in that way; it may sound crass or caustic, but I cannot solve everyone\u2019s problems. I hope that through seeing and observing me through my social media accounts that they do receive the inspiration that they need to get out of whatever hold that they\u2019re in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer ambitious calendar is currently loaded with events such as a 50K with the North Face Endurance in Washington, D.C.; a 10K the following day; a host of Tough Mudders; and traveling to the Azores Island to do a trail run.\n\nLike many, I wondered if there were any other books in her future. Although there are no confirmations yet, she hinted that she will be involved in several major projects that will touch on running and beyond.\n\nSo what advice does a motivational speaker and accomplished runner offer to those who want to get themselves started in fitness?\n\nWrite down your goals first. Speak them out to the universe, and then create a plan. If you want to start running or start weightlifting, write it down. Make sure that goal is actually achievable; you should have a SMART goal or plan. Break up your goals into smaller ones. Temper your schedule accordingly, and then work towards each goal without overwhelming yourself with the bigger goals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition, I personally suggest creating and sticking your vision board somewhere visible, like on your refrigerator; actually look at it. Be patient with your body. Stop retraumatizing yourself with negative stories.\n\nJust like when you tell yourself something positive while practicing self-love and care, negative thoughts work the same, in the opposite way. When you continue being overcritical of yourself, it retraumatizes you and may even change your DNA.

Buck has not spoken publicly about the incident. Police have not charged anyone with a crime, even though multiple reports have surfaced that Buck had a predilection for young, black men. Even after a number of young, black male sex workers have stepped forward with apparent photographic evidence that Buck was one of their clients. Even after each one of those men separately told the same story: Not only did Buck have a fetish for black men, but he was known in West Hollywood\u2019s gay community as someone paying top dollar for the company of 20-something black escorts ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut only after injecting them with drugs.\n\nWest Hollywood is known as the \u201csymbolic heart\u201d of LGBTQ Los Angeles. During the 1930s, gay men and women gathered in bars in the then-unincorporated part of the city to skirt federal and state Prohibition laws. In 1967, two years before New York City\u2019s Greenwich Village Stonewall riots put the fight for gay and lesbian rights on the map, a protest organized by the Personal Rights in Defense and Education organization kick-started the West Coast movement in West Hollywood.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince then, the West Hollywood area has been incorporated as a city and is known nationwide as a home for a thriving, affluent gay population. The city is a liberal enclave and has recently rebranded itself as WeHo.\n\nBuck was born in 1954 and came out to his parents at the age of 16, according to WeHoville. In the 1980s, after living and traveling as a male model and actor, Buck began working in Arizona for a company that provided information for driver\u2019s licenses. According to WeHoville, in a 1987 interview with the Arizona Republic, Buck said that he saw so much potential in the struggling company that he bought it out of bankruptcy for $250,000. Five years later, he sold the company for more than $1 million profit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1987 Buck, described by the Arizona Republic in the same article as a \u201cmillionaire, self-acknowledged homosexual and registered Republican,\u201d launched himself into politics by leading an effort to impeach Arizona Gov. Evan Mecham.\n\nEven though Buck\u2019s campaign led to the successful impeachment of the governor, Buck left the Republican Party because of its intolerant stance on LGBTQ issues. According to the profile in WeHoville, after arrests on narcotics and public indecency charges, Buck eventually left Arizona and moved to West Hollywood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was in West Hollywood that Buck became a major political backer. He helped Democrat John D\u2019Amico win a seat on the West Hollywood City Council and pushed for the nation\u2019s first ban on the sale of fur products.\n\nAlthough donations to political action committees don\u2019t have to be disclosed, Buck gave $2,700\u2014the maximum amount possible\u2014to the Hillary Clinton campaign, and online sources show he has donated more than $250 million to Democratic candidates. A quick Google Images search turns up pictures of Buck with some of the most powerful Democratic politicians in the country, including Clinton and California Gov. Jerry Brown.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf there was ever anybody in West Hollywood whose bed you expected a dead body to turn up in, it was Ed Buck.\u201d \u2014former West Hollywood Councilman Steve Martin\n\nIn 2017, Gemmel Moore relocated from Texas and moved to West Hollywood. Numerous friends of Moore confirmed his struggles with drugs, which, many say, were fueled by the fetishes of one of his most frequent clients\u2014Ed Buck.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoore\u2019s roommate and best friend, Samuel Lloyd, alleges that Buck had an unhealthy obsession with Moore. \u201cHe went out there searching for other men that were struggling and on the streets and had no money ... men who had never experienced drugs before,\u201d said Lloyd at an October 21 community meeting. \u201cThis is the kind of guys Ed Buck searched for.\u201d\n\nLloyd added that Moore had grown afraid of Buck in the days before his death, saying that \u201cGemmel was scared of this man. He came and he laid in my arms and he was scared. Scared that this man was going to hurt him.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLloyd said that Moore went to West Hollywood police a number of times to warn them about Buck to no avail.\n\nLloyd\u2019s allegations seem to be backed up by other men who provided photographic evidence of Buck\u2019s drug use with male escorts. Damar Love provided the WeHo Times with photographs of himself inside Buck\u2019s home. According to the Times, the pictures appeared to have been taken at the same apartment where Moore\u2019s body was found and show Love sitting next to a glass pipe often used to smoke crystal meth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLove told the WeHo Times that he serviced Buck at least three times. He stated that Buck insisted that Love turn off his cellphone and demanded that he do drugs before their encounter. In an interview with the WeHo Times, Love stated:\n\nWhen I get there, I always want my money up front, and that\u2019s how it always started.

In its report, the GAO made its assessment of MWO-firm access to all of them.\n\nFederal employees pay into federal plans from their salaries during their careers, and asset managers invest funds so that they build equity. Some of these entities include the Army and Air Force Exchange Service, the Federal Reserve System and the National Railway Retirement Investment Trust. Representatives from the GAO interviewed decision-makers from these entities to determine how well they were working to create opportunities for minority- and women-owned asset-management firms.\n\nVerdict: not good at all.\n\nIn some instances, none of the plans used MWO firms. Others used vey few. At BlackRock, a publicly traded asset-management firm that oversees three federal plans, just 1.6 percent of its managers are African American, while 81.5 percent are white; 13.5 percent are Asian.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the reasons minority- or women-owned businesses don\u2019t get as much of the asset-management pie is that, unless an entity specifically asks for a minority- or women-owned firm, consultants tasked with job searches will not even consider them, according to the report. Another issue is that there is a bias against using MWO firms because it is assumed that they will not perform as well as white ones, even though there is no data backing up that assumption, the report found. The GAO cited industry studies that reveal there is no difference between the performance of an MWO and a non-MWO firm.\n\nThe lack of opportunities that minority-owned firms get to handle federally managed dollars should concern Congress and Americans in general, said Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.).\n\n\u201cFederal employees are paying into this, and federal employees reflect the wonderful diversity of our nation,\u201d he said. \u201cSo when you have high-quality, strong-performing [asset] managers who don\u2019t give [MWO firms] a shot to manage some of these funds, it flies in the face of our values as a nation of equal opportunities and inclusion.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Booker arrived in Washington in 2013, tackling asset-management diversity in contracting was one of the first issues he took on. A year later, he and Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-N.Y.) and Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) held a summit with pension-fund administrators to find out why there were so few MWO firms getting a shot to manage federal assets.\n\nOne issue is that the process of how to apply for contracts is not very clear or made readily available to prospective minority-owned firms. Firm size is another challenge. Institutional investors often require firms to have a minimum of threshold assets under management\u2014usually $1 billion, at the very least; liability insurance; as well as lengthy track records that smaller firms usually do not have.\n\nBut the dearth of ethnic and gender diversity is not the only issue with having federal assets managed by a select few firms. A major concern for Meeks is the potential for a security breach of a firm managing a lion\u2019s share of assets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf you have a cyber breach of that firm, it would impact all of the federal employees,\u201d Meeks said. \u201cBut if you broke it down so that you had many small firms, it would not have an effect over the broad scope of everyone, and it better diversifies what those risks may be.\u201d\n\nAs bleak as the report\u2019s findings were, there were some recommendations for improvement. Federal investment entities could create minority-centered competitions that are marketed to firms that historically have been excluded from federal bidding. Adjusting high thresholds for assets under management, liability insurance and years of management experience would ensure that smaller firms were eligible to apply.\n\nThe report emphasized that the leadership of pension funds and various government plans has to prioritize diversity, and the consultants hired to search for asset managers have to diversify their Rolodexes beyond their typical recruiting pools. Meeks stressed that adjusting these thresholds isn\u2019t the same as lowering standards. To the contrary, it is about access to the bidding process that is proportionate to a firm, regardless of size.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen asked what he and his colleagues would do to ensure that MWO firms get federal asset-management jobs in the future, Booker said that he would continue challenging fund administrators to accept the GAO\u2019s recommendations on diversifying the firms that are handing their assets.\n\n\u201cIf they have such little amounts of diversity or do not have a [diversity] program, that\u2019s unacceptable,\u201d Booker said. \u201cThe more we can shine a light on the problem and demonstrate there are constructive things they could be doing, the more quickly we\u2019re going to see changes being made.\u201d\n\n", "keywords": ["mwo", "minority", "getting", "meeks", "firm", "diversity", "federal", "report", "plans", "contracts", "firms", "assetmanagement"], "polarity": 0.026336545399045397, "subjectivity": 0.3772763000888001},

But just as frequently, my dreadlocks and scalp kick my ass just as hard as my fitness regimen. And when I try to recruit a new fitness buddy, I\u2019m frequently met with frustrating rejections because of worries about their tresses; whether they\u2019ve taken the chemically relaxed route to straighten their hair or are sporting their naturally kinky coils.\n\nAs a woman of color and a fitness nut, I want to eliminate some of the anxieties from your beauty regimen and incorporate great ways to get you back in the gym. If you\u2019re committed to getting fit, here are some sweat-ready hairstyles you may want to consider:\n\n\n\nBe Protective With Braids, Twists and Cornrows\n\nProtective styles such as braids and cornrows tend to be naturally low-maintenance. These styles minimize breakage from frequent styling or various heat applications, keeping your hair intact while you work it out. After kicking ass in the gym, consider unraveling your braids and sporting a twist-out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPull It Back in a Ponytail or Bun\n\nPonytails and buns are not only easy, but versatile. Pop that hair to one side for a fun \u201980s-inspired look, or go for a classic high bun for a night out on the town after releasing all of those endorphins. Or tap into old Hollywood with a playful twist, similar to this chignon on Rihanna.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSlay With a Short Do\n\nRegardless of what hair type you have, a short cut can accentuate your natural features while maintaining your chic. If done well, shorter hairstyles require less styling time than their longer counterparts. Tap into your inner Nefertiti with a fabulous high-top, or take your cues from Halle Berry and mimic her legendary gorgeous short haircuts.\n\n\n\nHide It in a Head Wrap\n\nPlenty of women\u2014including myself\u2014have embraced wearing head wraps because of their versatility and practicality. Interestingly enough, there\u2019s an abundance of head-wrap history in African and Afro-Brazilian culture. If you\u2019re curious, check out this Nigerian Ankara head-wrap tutorial, or follow Franchesca Ramsey\u2019s one-minute video on how to rock that printed scarf that\u2019s been collecting dust for months.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDevote Yourself to Dreadlocks\n\nDon\u2019t chop my head off. Yes, I did say I go through issues, too, but honestly, dreadlocks are very forgiving. However, please bear in mind that they are permanent. But like some of the aforementioned styles, you can cornrow your dreadlocks into braids, throw them into a sloppy bun or keep them in place with a stylish head wrap. If you don\u2019t want to commit, consider faux locs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBe Unbeweavable\n\nI didn\u2019t forget about my girls who love their sew-ins. While this is not just a tip for women who wear weaves, I heavily suggest wearing a headband or scarf to protect your edges. Wrap your hair and place a stocking cap on top before using a silk scarf or cap on top; that will allow you to protect your tresses and look presentable.\n\n\n\nBut wait: Here\u2019s a bit more info on protecting your hair while perfecting your health:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat to Do When Your Workout Is Done\n\nIf you have the ability, wash your hair with a good shampoo. When my locs require TLC, I prefer natural remedies, like soaking my hair for 10 minutes in an apple-cider vinegar wash to remove impurities from my locs. It\u2019s not something I\u2019d suggest doing all of the time\u2014doing this too much can screw up your hair\u2019s pH balance.\n\nIn between washes, using a dry shampoo on your roots goes a long way toward removing dirt and residue from your hair. After your workout, spritz your scalp with coconut oil, an olive oil sheen or even tea tree oil. For those who wear locs or braids, take it a step further by using peppermint or rosemary oil to remove any musty scents.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf your hair or scalp is damp underneath your sew-in, blow-dry your hair on a lower setting. A moist, sweaty scalp can lead to a foul odor and retain buildup, damaging your actual hair. And applying too much heat on a regular basis will cause hair breakage.\n\n\n\nRemember to alternate your hairstyles every now and then. Some days, I allow my hair to do its own thing. Brushing or pulling your hair in the same direction can cause traction alopecia over time\u2014and nobody has time for that.\n\nI may not have all of the answers to your specific hair-care needs, but at the intersection of beauty and fitness, I hope this aids you in getting back into a regimen that you love.\n\n", "keywords": ["tips", "braids", "enthusiast", "hair", "oil", "scalp", "scarf", "using", "styles", "haircare", "tresses", "head", "fitness", "short", "protect", "reluctant"], "polarity": 0.16237208147044208, "subjectivity": 0.4462535824830907},

The Republican guy running for governor of that state, former Republican National Committee Chairman Ed Gillespie\u2014who\u2019s openly aligned his campaign with Confederate, xenophobic and pro-police sympathies\u2014could very well snatch the seat from Democrats Tuesday ... in the state where Charlottesville unfolded across millions of screens.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not even start on the state\u2019s legislative races in which Democrats (if they were really serious) have an opening to flip Richmond, former capital of the Confederacy that it was, from red to blue. Pure political malfeasance now unfolds in a state where nearly a quarter of the population is black and the Latino proportion, along with the Muslim demographics, continues to grow.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s equally sad that, about 10 months after the confirmation of Jeff Sessions as U.S. attorney general, Roy Moore\u2014a Klan-ish former Alabama Supreme Court chief justice harboring a Donald Trump-rally-sized grudge against voting rights and pretty much any progress black folks have made in the last half century\u2014is about to fill Sessions\u2019 vacant Senate seat without Democrats putting up much of a fight.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Moore win on Dec. 12 would certainly make Sessions happy as he continues to aggressively roll back voting rights and affirmative action and up every ante in his government\u2019s war against \u201cblack identity extremists.\u201d\n\nMoore\u2019s almost certain victory is happening in a state that\u2019s about 30 percent black and where Republicans have waged robust voter-suppression warfare through voter-ID laws, reduced voter-registration access, shuttered places to vote and eliminating early voting. Alabama is also one of eight states that refuse to restore the voting rights of formerly convicted felons\u2014in a place where 54 percent of the prison population is black.\n\n\n\nOne common theme that keeps popping up is how the Democratic Party hates its black voters. Yet, as wack and message-empty as the DNC is, it\u2019s about the only operational political machine that can work for the black electorate at this moment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlabama should have been ground zero for black voter mobilization behind Democratic Senate nominee and former U.S. Attorney Doug Jones.\n\nIt\u2019s a month away, but we need to ask now, while focused on this latest cluster of elections: How do you let the Senate seat that Sessions owned slip out of your hands when you\u2019re in a state with that many black folks to help you? Easy: You act as if they don\u2019t exist and let Jones fall behind by an average of 10-plus points.\n\n\n\nHead north to Philadelphia\u2014where the majority of residents are black\u2014and you\u2019ll find overconfident, Hillary Clinton-acting Democrats allowing the pro-police union, pro-punishment Republican nominee Beth Grossman a competitive edge in the city\u2019s consequential district attorney race.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot only has the Democratic nominee Larry Krasner cockily assumed that he\u2019ll win, but he\u2019s also underestimating the potential turnout of quiet, white Trump voters who are clustered up with those voters who wearily watch rising violence in a town experiencing a gentrifying economic reawakening.\n\nBlack turnout in Philly is so low during DA races, it\u2019s laughable; yet black folks are predictably\u2014and rightfully so\u2014the loudest when they\u2019re targeted by police and prosecutors. Meanwhile, local Democrats, battered by nonstop party corruption tales and convictions, believe that all they need is a voter-registration edge.\n\n\n\nCampaign 101: Registration doesn\u2019t mean turnout.\n\nAlong with a potential upset in Philly is a potential tragedy for Pennsylvania should the state lose the chance to install the first black state Supreme Court justice in more than 20 years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019re squandering a great 2018 congressional midterms pregame moment. To quote the late, great Redd Foxx, we\u2019re all going to feel like \u201cbig dummies\u201d when we wake up the day after Election Day to more rebel yells of giddy white nationalists as their anti-black candidates win in states where it counts.\n\nAll that stands between former Pittsburgh Steeler and Allegheny County Judge Dwayne Woodruff and an open seat on the commonwealth\u2019s most powerful court is the battleground state\u2019s massive gun-toting, Trump-loving white voter bloc that actually pays attention to judicial races like this \u2026 and the apathetic black electorate that, usually, doesn\u2019t.\n\n\n\nIf property taxes don\u2019t energize white suburban voters enough in New Jersey, Democratic gubernatorial nominee Phil Murphy, along with his black running mate and former state Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver, should be able to best GOP Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno and retake Trenton from the outgoing and widely unpopular Republican Gov. Chris Christie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut who knows? Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez, during a recent interview on WURD\u2019s Reality Check while stumping through the Garden State, mentioned Donald Trump and Christie more than he promoted his own candidates.\n\nMany of us grousing in \u201cSMH\u201d disbelief are not all that optimistic. One common theme that keeps popping up is how the Democratic Party hates its black voters. Yet, as wack and message-empty as the DNC is, it\u2019s about the only operational political machine that can work for the black electorate at this moment.\n\nIn Virginia, Democrats should have easily leveraged Charlottesville into battle cries, especially when their nominee Ralph Northam\u2019s lieutenant governor hopeful and running mate is the black, young and photogenic Justin Fairfax (who bears the name of the state\u2019s most powerful and wealthiest county).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut you barely know that Fairfax exists. And Northam is opting to run flat-ass responses to Gillespie\u2019s (hate to say it) really effective and constantly looping white-fearmongering commercials, along with vanilla campaign ads that exclusively court the same white women who mostly bolted for Trump last year.\n\n\n\nCalling foul on every tease, gaffe or statement the racist opposition makes is the preferred method over quieter, smarter, more strategic rallying of existing resources.\n\nThe collective black political, media and advocacy class doesn\u2019t seem to care either.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt took the Latino (emphasis mine) Victory Fund PAC to label Ed Gillespie a closeted Confederate with this creative ad (which was, strangely, pulled the other day). The National Black Caucus of State Legislators, a what-could\u2019ve-been umbrella of more than 600 black state elected officials, is defunct.\n\nCalling foul on every tease, gaffe or statement the racist opposition makes is the preferred method over quieter, smarter, more strategic rallying of existing resources.\n\nCongressional Black Caucus Chairman Rep. Cedric Richmond (D-La.) told White House chief of staff John Kelly that he needed \u201ca history lesson\u201d\u2014but while Kelly stirs up white voters with his ahistorical Civil War comments, where\u2019s the black-voter game plan? There\u2019s no mention that says: \u201cHey, folks, you really want to hit these folks back where it hurts? Make sure you go to battle on Tuesday in Alabama, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Virginia.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSocial media is all punch-and-run with the toothless outrage porn in reaction to white supremacists. Meanwhile, organizations plunging into irrelevance are busily pushing travel advisories about an airline that already sucked at customer service rather than an advisory on the dangerous white voters about to blast black folks on Tuesday.\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re squandering a great 2018 congressional midterms pregame moment.

What we need to worry about is how to avoid getting punked, yet again, by another \u201cPut the blacks in their place\u201d election and how we should (at the eleventh hour) get focused and counteract it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the end, election losers don\u2019t shape or change policy\u2014election winners do.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: An earlier version of this story said that the Alabama Senate election was happening Tuesday.

And also, for those who\u2019ve internalized this dehumanization\u2014which, to be fair, is probably all of us to some degree\u2014it\u2019s a way of reminding ourselves that our histories and our peoples didn\u2019t begin at slavery and haven\u2019t always been as vulnerable.\n\nBut I just wish that those who choose to do this would just, well, stop doing it. Because kingdoms and queendoms are nothing to aspire to.

The agreement\u2014signed by Amy Dacey, the former CEO of the DNC, and Robby Mook with a copy to Marc Elias\u2014specified that in exchange for raising money and investing in the DNC, Hillary would control the party\u2019s finances, strategy and all the money raised. Her campaign had the right of refusal of who would be the party communications director, and it would make final decisions on all the other staff. The DNC also was required to consult with the campaign about all other staffing, budgeting, data, analytics and mailings.\n\nI had been wondering why it was that I couldn\u2019t write a press release without passing it by [Clinton\u2019s headquarters in] Brooklyn [New York]. Well, here was the answer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrazile writes that she was shocked to discover that Politico\u2019s previous claim that the DNC had been \u201cessentially money laundering\u201d for Clinton through extravagant state fundraisers was not so far off the mark.\n\nThe funding arrangement with HFA and the victory fund agreement was not illegal, but it sure looked unethical. If the fight had been fair, one campaign would not have control of the party before the voters had decided which one they wanted to lead. This was not a criminal act, but as I saw it, it compromised the party\u2019s integrity.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) took it a step further. When CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper asked Warren on Thursday if she believed that the primary election had been rigged against Sanders, she simply responded, \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClinton supporters touting the fact that the joint-fundraising agreement between the Clinton campaign and the DNC was reported in 2015 have dedicated themselves to the most disingenuous reading of this situation as possible. Despite NPR posting the entire text of the memorandum\u2014which supplemented the standard joint-fundraising agreement that Sanders signed as well, Clinton supporters continue to claim that Brazile is a liar. She may very well be, but not about this.\n\n\n\nThey claim that any critique of the arrangement is driven by politically illiterate pure-mongers with a so-called far-leftist agenda\u2014or people who believe that Fox News is anything other than white supremacist propaganda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nhttps://www.theroot.com/hillary-clinton-rigged-the-race-against-bernie-sanders-1820087834\n\nSome have decided to wallow in semantics and gaslighting, insisting that the primary could not have been \u201crigged\u201d because Sanders had the same opportunity to raise money for the Democratic Party as Clinton and chose not to do so. These people conveniently hopscotch over the reality that Sanders did not have internal party support, nor wealthy donors from Hollywood to Wall Street. Instead, he depended primarily on small donations from individual donors, effectively circumventing the established system and shocking the Democratic Party.\n\n\n\nThe problem here is not that the arrangement was illegal, but that it was completely legal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClinton, on the other hand, through the 2015 memorandum signed in addition to the joint-fundraising agreement, allegedly raised money \u201cfor the party\u201d to be used in the general election to support whomever the candidate might be, but the lion\u2019s share of those funds were rerouted directly to her campaign.\n\nPolitico reported in 2016:\n\nThe victory fund has transferred $3.8 million to the state parties, but almost all of that cash ($3.3 million, or 88 percent) was quickly transferred to the DNC, usually within a day or two, by the Clinton staffer who controls the committee, POLITICO\u2019s analysis of the FEC records found. By contrast, the victory fund has transferred $15.4 million to Clinton\u2019s campaign and $5.7 million to the DNC, which will work closely with Clinton\u2019s campaign if and when she becomes the party\u2019s nominee. And most of the $23.3 million spent directly by the victory fund has gone toward expenses that appear to have directly benefited Clinton\u2019s campaign, including $2.8 million for \u201csalary and overhead\u201d and $8.6 million for web advertising that mostly looks indistinguishable from Clinton campaign ads and that has helped Clinton build a network of small donors who will be critical in a general election expected to cost each side well in excess of $1 billion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrazile claims in her book that she didn\u2019t want to believe the stranglehold that Clinton had over the DNC, but she could no longer deny it once the evidence was staring her in the face.\n\n\u201cThe day that Donna discovered this, she called me and I almost passed out,\u201d Ray Buckley, the chairman of New Hampshire\u2019s Democratic Party, told the Chicago Tribune of that moment in 2016. \u201cWe were blatantly misled.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of Brazile\u2019s political maelstrom, liberals who once exalted the Clinton ally are now labeling her a dishonest, opportunist book peddler with self-serving motives\u2014i.e., book sales. The charges against Brazile are valid\u2014let\u2019s be clear on that\u2014and worthy of examination.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnce Brazile became the ceremonial sacrifice on the altar of political corruption after being caught feeding Clinton debate questions during the primary race against Sanders, she showed none of this newly revealed turmoil that she expects observers to buy into like 6-year-olds with no knowledge of how corrupt politics work. Previously, when her collusion with the Clinton campaign was exposed, she insisted: \u201cMy conscience\u2014as an activist, as a strategist\u2014my conscience is very clear. ... If I had to do it all over again, I would know a hell of a lot more about cybersecurity.\u201d\n\nThis is what democracy hypocrisy looks like.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat Brazile meant was that she would know next time to hide her dirt better\u2014and Clinton supporters were fine with that because Brazile was playing the game as she was expected to play it. After all, who did Bernie Sanders think he was\u2014a Democrat? According to Clinton supporters, it was foolish to expect the Democratic Party to show the same support for an independent who, despite caucusing with Democrats, would always be considered an interloper.\n\n\n\nBrazile laughed off her willing participation in the rigged debate as commonplace political gamesmanship\u2014hey, that\u2019s just the way it is. Now, though, we\u2019re supposed to believe that when she discovered the shockingly unethical nature of the agreement between Clinton and the DNC, she was swimming in tortured emotions. That she was so distraught as she \u201ccentered\u201d herself to \u201ccall Bernie\u201d that she had to light candles, listen to gospel music and pray that Jesus would take the wheel.\n\nCompletely innocent and ethical Donna from New Orleans was shocked by the murky depths of the swamp. That\u2019s what we\u2019re supposed to believe.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn her book excerpt, Brazile manages to cast blame on the Clinton campaign, former DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the DNC leadership and former President Barack Obama, who apparently \u201cneglected\u201d the party, borrowed too much money and paid it back too slowly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI haven\u2019t had the opportunity to read Brazile\u2019s book, but I do wonder if she, in her newfound allegiance to truth and transparency, takes any semblance of responsibility for her own unethical actions in any of the chapters.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m lying. I don\u2019t wonder. The answer is most certainly no.\n\nA rigged system does not ensure that those in power win each time; it ensures that the status quo remains the same.\n\nClearly, whatever Brazile was promised or expecting for playing ball didn\u2019t pan out. Clinton supporters may pretend that false outrage and facts are mutually exclusive, but we know that\u2019s far from the truth. Brazile may have self-serving reasons for coming forward now\u2014including, but not limited to, book sales and getting in where she fits among the growing contingent of progressive black women who realize that the Democratic Party is failing them. Brazile is smart enough to want to catch the wave.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nhttp://www.theroot.com/more-black-women-are-realizing-that-the-democratic-part-1818650231\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean, however, that politics isn\u2019t dirty or that the electoral system isn\u2019t rigged\u2014voter suppression and gerrymandering already tell us that it is. The deal between Clinton and the DNC is simply political manipulation at its most insidious. If someone is invested in one candidate over the other, they will intentionally not see that or pretend that they don\u2019t.\n\nSo for Clinton supporters who vacillate between claiming she has done no wrong and is only viciously maligned because she\u2019s a woman to cheering her ability to play the game as dirty as any man: Let\u2019s play a game.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet\u2019s imagine for one moment that Sanders was the one with flush pockets. Let\u2019s say the DNC came to him for a handout to save it from itself and its futile quest to usher white supremacists with hearts of sparkling coal dust into the Democratic Party fold. Let\u2019s say Sanders agreed to share the wealth and, in return, he was allowed to control strategy and spending of the supposedly impartial party apparatus to the point where even press releases didn\u2019t go out without his camp\u2019s approval.\n\nUnless Donna Brazile is a bold-faced liar\u2014which so many Clinton supporters are now saying she is\u2014this is how it went down between Clinton and the DNC.\n\nIf that had happened, Clinton supporters would be calling for investigations and congressional hearings. Russia? What Russia? There would be rallies and marches. There would be charges of misogyny and collusion and unethical behavior. It would be a pink-pussy-hat extravaganza of extreme order.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nInstead? Clinton supporters are frantically insisting that all but the most politically immature observers know that \u201cthis is how the system works\u201d and there\u2019s nothing to see here.\n\n\n\nAnd you know what? They\u2019re right. This is exactly how the system works. What Clinton and the DNC did by entering into their arrangement was not illegal. We all know that what is legal is often in direct conflict with what is just, fair and transparent. No, the problem here is not that the arrangement was illegal, but that it was completely legal.\n\nWe should ask ourselves why that is and whom exactly does it benefit.\n\nHillary Clinton is a sharp, skilled politician who knows the fine art of plausible deniability. Her supporters are quick to laud her experience, her deftness in navigating male-dominated waters and her tactical superiority. She saw an opportunity to tilt the scales in her favor and she did. She paid to play, and the Democratic Party mortgaged its already dubious claims of impartiality in exchange for money and connections. That is how the game is played. And for self-proclaimed pragmatic liberals to claim ignorance now is laughable.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA rigged system does not ensure that those in power win each time; it ensures that the status quo remains the same.\n\n\n\nJust as the truth of white supremacist police forces does not mean that every black child will be lynched by killers with badges; just as the truth that an education system that institutionalizes and criminalizes black and brown students to protect white power will not succeed in killing the intellectual fire in all black and brown students; just as the truth of mass incarceration does not mean that every single black person who lives in occupied communities will find themselves behind bars\u2014a political system rigged in favor of corporate cronyism, capitalism, patriarchy and white supremacy is still a system rigged in favor or corporate cronyism, capitalism, patriarchy and white supremacy, whether it succeeds in its mission in each instance or not.\n\nThis is not merely about Hillary Clinton winning the primary, or at least it shouldn\u2019t be. Bernie Sanders, who has continually shown his ingrained instincts to \u201cother\u201d black and brown people, is not a white savior. If he had won the primary and gone on to win the general election, it wouldn\u2019t have been simply because his populist message resonated so deeply among both millennials and people of color who understand that you can\u2019t have capitalism without racism. It wouldn\u2019t have been because he was once adjacent to the civil rights movement. Sanders\u2019 ability to make the so-called white working class comfortable in a way that Hillary Clinton could not is what would have given him the edge in swing states she lost.\n\nhttp://www.theroot.com/white-working-class-narrative-is-nothing-but-a-racist-1790857771\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat kind of negotiation with white supremacy should rightfully be placed under a microscope. It is why a political duopoly will never be in the best interests of freedom and liberation. The game is rigged no matter who is on the board, and it always has been.\n\nClinton knows it.\n\n\n\nSanders knows it.\n\n\n\nThe DNC and the RNC know it.\n\n\n\nTrump knows it.\n\n\n\nAnd if political cheerleaders would put down the pom-poms for their favorites, they would admit that they know it, too. It is simply a matter of whom it chooses to favor and what deal(s) with the devil(s) had to transpire for it to be so.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know this much to be true: Instead of doubling down on duplicity, the Democratic Party better have a real reckoning\u2014and soon. Refusing to indict a system that\u2019s guilty as hell just to score political points means that we all lose, just as Dems will lose again in 2020 if they keep insulting the intelligence and doubting the determination of the people they claim to serve.\n\n\n\nCount on it.", "keywords": ["brazile", "donna", "supporters", "rigged", "white", "party", "liberal", "democratic", "clinton", "campaign", "democracy", "dnc", "sanders", "system", "refusal", "socalled", "curious", "case", "admit"], "polarity": 0.05053217288819383, "subjectivity": 0.43411268632472844},

OK.\n\nThe sweatshirt image caught the attention of New York Times columnist Charles M. Blow and prompted an instant uproar. Many threatened to boycott the Swedish chain after seeing the disturbing advertisement. Flocks of customers took to Twitter and Facebook voicing their concerns, demanding that the image be pulled down; others remained on the fence about H&M\u2019s intentions, claiming that the European retailer may be out of touch on such a loaded topic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe use of \u201cmonkey\u201d as a racist term has a deplorable history, dating back to the 1570s with the fable of a Portuguese woman being raped by an African ape and being forced to have its babies.\n\nInevitably, some will ignore that loaded history and argue that we live in an overly sensitive society where everything is offensive. And sure, we could simply blame this on poor judgment by H&M\u2019s marketing department. But that\u2019s a tough sell for Black Twitter, which isn\u2019t inclined to forgive so easily. After all, the retailer also featured two other hoodies on white children emblazoned with \u201cJunior Tour Guide\u201d and \u201cSurvival Expert\u201d\u2014though all of the hoodies have been pulled from the site.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut this is just the latest in a series of affronts by the fashion and beauty industries.

Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas) as saying that young black women have been jarred by the bigots in the White House because things were \u201cwell\u201d under President Barack Obama:\n\nRepresentative Sheila Jackson Lee, a Texas Democrat in the Congressional Black Caucus, addressed the news after the poll\u2019s release at the Washington Convention Center. \u201cI respect independents.

It has long been clear that resisting white supremacists like Donald Trump and his sociopolitical criminal enterprise, while insisting that a party that campaigns primarily on being better than the opposition is our only hope, is life-threatening.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is about much more than \u201cvalues\u201d and loss of political innocence, though liberals continue to intentionally frame it that way; this is about strategic, institutional, violent oppression that continues to decimate entire communities.

I transitioned from joking about having two left feet to signing up for a pole dancing course; I left feeling excited and hopeful.\n\n\n\nBefore long, I performed in a pole dancing showcase in the middle of marathon and obstacle-course training, as another demonstration of my athleticism. But despite my sense of pride, rampant stigmas about the sport persist. I\u2019ve experienced everything from being told that it\u2019s too \u201cprovocative\u201d to being personally reminded that I am a parent who needs to \u201cmaintain my integrity.\u201d To debunk a few stereotypes about this highly athletic activity, I spoke with five fierce pole athletes about their experiences as instructors, performers and students.\n\n1. Ashley Fox\n\nAshley Fox, owner and pole sport instructor of Foxy Fitness & Pole in New York City and New Jersey, is a powerhouse who\u2019s earned numerous accolades from competitions across the world. Her extensive r\u00e9sum\u00e9 includes several pole dancing competitions, including the 2016 Paragon Championship. She was subsequently first runner-up in the 2017 Pole Olympia Championship. She will be holding workshops at the International Pole Convention and Pole Expo in late 2018.\n\nDespite her gymnastics, dance and cheerleading background, Fox found her athleticism in pole training. \u201cPole is the best because it combines elements from all forms of fitness and dance. The challenge of mastering strength, flexibility and dance really maximizes your physical ability,\u201d she says. \u201cBefore pole, I just felt like my body was regular; now I feel strong and feminine. I see myself as a beauty beast.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Yumiko Harris\n\nFox\u2019s general manager and pole sport instructor Yumiko Harris shared similar sentiments about the intense sport. Harris, a contemporary-dance graduate of the University of North Carolina School of the Arts, went through an artistic freeze after being burned-out by college. Before becoming the 2017 Northeast Pole Championship first place winner, she even experienced a stint of depression.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThrough a cousin\u2019s encouragement, she signed up for her first pole class. \u201cI wasn\u2019t intrigued by the appeal of bringing on your sexy,\u201d Harris says. Despite her self-proclaimed lackluster first experience, she left feeling invigorated about dancing again.\n\nAfter researching the requirements of becoming a pole dancing instructor, she took a leap of faith, leaving Chicago and pursuing a career as an instructor at Fox\u2019s New York City studio. \u201cPole dancing is empowering to the mind, body and soul because it\u2019s an individual or team sport,\u201d Harris says. \u201cIt creates that community of women becoming stronger together, not through sexuality but strength. We\u2019ve come so far now with pole sport that they\u2019re pushing it into the Olympics.\u201d\n\n3. Veronica Jamison\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIllustrator Veronica Jamison took a similar route, letting her interest lead her to becoming an instructor. Jamison, a pole dance instructor at Pole Haus in Philadelphia, went from taking pole classes once or twice a week to embarking on a teacher-training program just months after enrollment. Despite her recreational dancer background, she sometimes felt out of place being a curvy plus-size woman.\n\n\u201cI have been a curvy woman my entire adult life,\u201d Jamison says. \u201cPole dancing has been instrumental in me getting over my body image issues. It really made me appreciate my body, transitioning from wanting to change it to getting into the mold of being marveled at for what it can do. Before I started pole dancing, I was really self-conscious about my body\u2014the fact that I work in fashion didn\u2019t help. Being around my pole family, seeing others not self-conscious about their bodies or passing judgment, helped me appreciate what I can do.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve gotten feedback like, \u2018What is your husband saying?\u2019 And if people have something to say about it, they have their own assumptions about it. It\u2019s not my job to convince them why I do it,\u201d she adds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Tina Powell\n\nActress and pole dancer Tina Powell has been teaching for a little over a year at the Choreography House in North Hollywood and Evolve Pole Dance in Los Angeles. She admits that like many, her perception of pole dancing was initially askew:\n\nI came to pole dancing accidentally by winning a free class. I never would\u2019ve tried it otherwise. I am generally an open-minded person and feel women can do as they please with their bodies, as long as no one is harmed. Yet I used to have reservations about stripping and pole dancing. I assumed exotic dancers must have emotional issues [and] low self-esteem and standards if they were \u201cselling sex\u201d and their bodies. Because of these misconceptions, I never saw the draw to pole dancing as a hobby, and I certainly didn\u2019t think of it as a sport. I realize now that pole dancing is not necessarily about sexuality. There are so many different styles of pole, though I prefer the sensual type. But I know when I dance, I\u2019m never thinking about sex or that unsolicited dick pic. Rather, pole dancing is about letting go of self-judgment, and moving with purpose. A huge part of a woman\u2019s power is in her sensuality. That power intimidates many men and makes them feel a need to shame us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. Roz Mays\n\nConversely, National Academy of Sports Medicine-certified personal trainer and 10-year pole dancer Roz \u201cthe Diva\u201d Mays doesn\u2019t have a dancer background. \u201cMy first class was disaster dot com,\u201d she says. \u201cI love to dance and I have a Beyonc\u00e9 complex. I remember coming home thinking it\u2019s the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done in my life, and it\u2019s still the hardest sport I\u2019ve done, but I love it.\u201d Although she didn\u2019t have preconceptions about the activity, she took it on as a hobby through a class offered at Crunch Gym.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve gone through different periods of my own style where I want to be Black Swan, and other times where I want to dance like Black Chyna,\u201d Mays continues. \u201cThere\u2019s a stereotype that we\u2019re a bunch of hos or wannabe strippers. We\u2019re actually not\u2014and shoutout to strippers, because they work 10 times harder than we do.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, Mays is no stranger to hazing from the internet:\n\nPeople think that me doing a sport at my size is promoting obesity. There\u2019s isn\u2019t anything that people can write about me on the internet that\u2019s worse than anything that I said about myself. When people call me fat, ugly or a man, it\u2019s still 10 times nicer than the things that I said. Before poling, I thought I was disgusting beyond belief. There was no relationship between me and my body. After pole, I am starting to heal. Never once in my lifetime have I embraced my body. People make that assumption and it\u2019s not true\u2014I have a better view of myself physically, but I have 30 years of damage, and it\u2019s going to take some years to reverse it. For the first four or five years, I thought I was too big to wear pole shorts. When I did get the guts, it was like the weight of the world lifted off of my shoulders. I remember the first class that I did that six years ago; I cried until my eyes were swimming on my bed. It was a relief cry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAcross the board, all five instructors strongly urged potential students to attend just one class. Neither sweaty palms nor a lack of upper body strength serves as an excuse to avoid trying. Instead, be consistent and present and learn the foundation. Regardless of your shape, size, gender or disability, you should feel comfortable coming to class. If a one-armed pole dancer can eloquently pursue her passion on the pole, you shouldn\u2019t let stereotypes discourage you. \u201cDo your research, wear shorts and let us do the rest,\u201d says Yumiko Harris. Investigate which style works best for you, and allow pole dancing to invigorate your life in the new year.\n\n", "keywords": ["stereotypesand", "defying", "dancer", "dance", "feel", "athletes", "gravity", "debunk", "harris", "try", "dare", "dancing", "class", "pole", "body", "sport", "instructor"], "polarity": 0.14718147641831852, "subjectivity": 0.485269274585064},

Somewhere between a black millennial and Gen Xer, he was someone who\u2019d worked on campaigns in Georgia and had a pretty good feel for what was going on throughout Atlanta and the surrounding suburbs.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat white boy \u2019bout to lose,\u201d was the first thing he said.\n\nAt first I was kind of surprised: Most polls showed the Georgia special election to be close, with Democrat Ossoff performing reasonably well and sometimes even leading Republican Karen Handel. It was the most expensive congressional race in history, and I knew several Republicans who told me privately that Ossoff was going to pull off the upset.\n\nHowever, with a few days on the ground and knowing the district, I expected Ossoff to lose in a close race, but hearing that sentiment from a campaign insider was unexpected. Yet it became a resounding theme, especially among the African-American political consultants and campaign insiders I spoke to. No matter what happened or how much money was spent, the racial dynamics of Georgia weren\u2019t going to let a Democrat win in a red district.\n\nDemocratic armchair quarterbacks were throwing pretzels long before Ossoff\u2019s 48 percent-to-52 percent loss to Handel was called on the cable news networks: The Democratic Party lacks a message; Jon Ossoff spent too much time talking about Trump; Jon Ossoff spent too little time talking about Trump; Jon Ossoff shoulda just kicked the field goal. Everyone seemed to know exactly what Atlanta Democrats should have done.\n\nThe truth is, the Republican Party had a 9 percent advantage in voter registration in the Georgia 6th. Hardworking local organizations got more than 129,000 people to early-vote, and more than 50,000 new voters registered between the April primary and the special election in June. But gerrymandering is a serious drug.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Georgia 6th was drawn in a way to guarantee that a ham sandwich, a wet tablecloth, Team Rocket or a Margo Martindale clone will win any race so long as they have an \u201cR\u201d by their name. There was no \u201cmessage\u201d from Ossoff on how he was going to turn college-educated Republicans into Democratic special election voters. There is no cheat code to make up a 9 percent registration deficit that either Bernie Sanders, Barack Obama, Bill Clinton or JFK could have come up with to change the election results. Privately, most Republicans in Atlanta will acknowledge that Ossoff ran about as flawless a campaign as possible, given the circumstances, but he couldn\u2019t overcome the structure of the district.\n\nThe Georgia special election demonstrates the limitations of the Democratic Party right now, as well as the weakness of the Republicans even in what are supposed to be safe districts. Republicans just spent $23 million to keep a congressional district that no Democrat has won in 40 years. That\u2019s like McDonald\u2019s spending millions to remind us they still sell hamburgers. If what you\u2019re selling is any good, you shouldn\u2019t have to spend that much to remind us.\n\nHowever, while some outside the district will second-guess and decry what happened in the race as some larger indictment of the Democratic Party, most African-American consultants on the ground were not surprised. When it came to the Georgia 6th special election, black folks knew that, like Airbnb rates and The Bachelorette, the fix was in.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhite people gonna white.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know my racist neighbors.\u201d\n\n\u201cOssoff left 10,000 black voters out there.\u201d\n\nIn the South\u2014even the \u201ceducated\u201d suburban South of a teeming multicultural metropolis like Atlanta\u2014racial dynamics and party dynamics overlap in inescapable ways. White people generally don\u2019t vote for the Democratic Party in Georgia, or any other Southern state. The idea that a coalition of educated suburban whites would actually team up with black voters to send a message to Donald Trump from Georgia was a fantasy created by the blue screen and CGI of outside Democratic analysts who want a happy ending to the Trump narrative in eight months.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarlier in the week, a middle-aged white woman in a heavily pro-Ossoff precinct called the police on me for simply reporting on a group of African-American canvassers in her neighborhood. Canvassers were threatened and spat on across the 6th District. The Democratic Party\u2019s most reliable base of voters, African Americans remain the primary targets of voter intimidation, suppression and policy abuse, but the Democrats continue to spend millions of dollars chasing after mythical \u201cmoderate\u201d Republicans and soccer moms.\n\nThis is not to suggest that African-American turnout alone would have won the Georgia 6th for the Democrats, but they spent about $25 million in that race. For that much money, they could\u2019ve gotten one season out of LeBron James, and I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s equal to a 20 percent increase in black turnout.\n\nMany consultants told me that the Ossoff campaign left much of the black-turnout work to outside groups and third parties, which is status quo in a regular election, but that\u2019s not the game-changing strategy you need in the most expensive congressional race in American history.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf there\u2019s any doubt about the value of tapping into the Southern black Democratic vote, just look at what happened six hours away in the South Carolina 5th District special election, which nobody was paying any attention to. There, quietly, the Democratic Party spent only $250,000 but tested out some experimental get-out-the-vote strategies for getting out the African-American vote.\n\nLook what happened:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDemocrat Archie Parnell lost to Republican Ralph Norman by a mere 4 percentage points, 51 to 47 percent, in a district that went for Trump by 20 percentage points in November. What was the difference? Consistent and creative African-American turnout efforts by the Democratic candidate throughout the entire campaign led to\u2014wait for it\u2014incredible jumps in turnout! Politics can be a simple game when you actually target your own voters instead of someone else\u2019s.\n\nAt the end of the night, when all networks had declared that Jon Ossoff lost the Georgia 6th congressional race, the watch-party room was still jubilant. Black, white, Asian, Latino; the room was the epitome of Atlanta in 2017, if not specifically Georgia\u2019s 6th District. People were cheering, dancing and drinking long into the night. I only saw two people crying; everyone else was dancing to suburban hip-hop (lots of Usher and radio-edited T.I.; this is Atlanta, after all).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApparently they missed the message from national Democrats that they were a bunch of failures. But maybe, just like the black consultants I talked to all throughout the day, the Ossoff revelers knew something that nobody else did. Ossoff\u2019s supporters knew that they had raised millions of dollars and made the GOP sweat in places it never expected. African-American Democrats know that even amid the same old racial cleavages, the \u201cCity Too Busy to Hate\u201d had made a smidgen of progress in spite of itself.\n\nAll along, people knew \u201cThat white boy \u2019bout to lose,\u201d but at least this time, it looked as if he, and they, went down swinging.", "keywords": ["ossoff", "politics", "boy", "race", "6th", "white", "ga", "party", "election", "bout", "inescapable", "racial", "africanamerican", "special", "lose", "district", "democratic", "black", "georgia"], "polarity": 0.09281416283369413, "subjectivity": 0.39821211774336773},

The Democratic Party is saying, \u201cI told y\u2019all.\u201d The pundits are giving the entire state of Alabama the credit. Even mainstream media has decided who was most responsible for Doug Jones\u2019 victory over the John Wayne of alleged pedophiles:\n\nYep, according to everyone, \u201cwomen\u201d are the ones who pushed Doug Jones\u2019 campaign for U.S. Senate over the finish line. Not black women. Not even black people. Just women.\n\nBut mostly white women.\n\nAccording to the punditry class, Jones\u2019 victory happened because of all women, including white women. Even though, according to the Washington Post, 63 percent of white women voted for Roy Moore, white women still received credit for the Jones victory. They were the heroes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack women got their shoutouts, and so did black men, but no one dared leave out white women. Although there is no statistical or logical reason to think that white women helped Doug Jones vanquish his opponent, they somehow came down on the right side of history. NBC News whitesplained it this way:\n\nFifty-eight percent of Alabama women voted for the winner, Democrat Doug Jones, including 35 percent of white women, according to exit polling. While that latter figure might not sound like much, it\u2019s more than twice the 16 percent of white Alabama women who voted for President Barack Obama in 2012, the last presidential race in which exit polling was conducted.\n\nWhat. The. Entire. Fuck.\n\nI know some people bristle at the idea that the benefit of whiteness is baked into every molecule of American existence, but the previous paragraph should be included in the dictionary alongside the phrase \u201cwhite privilege.\u201d Imagine taking an exam in front of the entire country, getting 63 percent of the answers wrong and\u2014not only do you pass the test\u2014but you are called to come to the front of the entire class so the professor can pat you on the back!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut wait ... there\u2019s more.\n\nThen there was the venerable political reporter Beth Clayton, who became the mouthpiece of the white-woman savior class. Immediately following the election, Clayton appeared on MSNBC to explain how white women had saved the world. She tied the election to the Harvey Weinstein sexual harassment scandal and the #MeToo movement (started by a black woman). She proudly explained to Chris Hayes:\n\nWhen you look at women in across Alabama or in any corner of the United States, we\u2019ve all been in a situation where a man didn\u2019t treat us right, and we know that feeling. And we know how it feels to not be believed. And we showed up and we said, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to tolerate it.\u201d And it helps that, looking across the country, women were beginning to be believed in all corners of America. And they felt confident coming out here in Alabama where, frankly, we frankly don\u2019t have a lot of room to wiggle here. And women came out, and we said, \u201cNo more.\u201d and frankly, no more. We deserve better than this.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI doubt she meant it in the way it came off, which is exactly why this Caucaplanation rubbed me the wrong way as soon as I saw it.\n\nWho the hell is \u201cwe\u201d? Clayton must have some black women in her purse, because \u201cwe\u201d didn\u2019t do a damn thing. The vast majority of white \u201cwe\u2019s\u201d voted for the other guy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack people are 26 percent of the population in Alabama, but the Washington Post says they were 29 percent of Tuesday\u2019s electorate. Conversely, whites are 68 percent of Alabama\u2019s population, yet only 66 percent voted in Alabama\u2019s Senate race.\n\nLet\u2019s put it this way: Using AL.com\u2019s raw vote totals and the Washington Post\u2019s exit polls, if all the women in the state assembled themselves and each of Jones\u2019 black female supporters stood beside a white woman who voted for him, there would still be 82,278 black women standing by themselves wondering, \u201cWhere the white women at?\u201d\n\n\n\nNow, explain to me, again, who \u201cshowed up.\u201d\n\nNot white women. That is a fact. Again ... numbers.\n\nWhite women are used to that. They get a privilege no one else in the world enjoys. They get to rail against the white male patriarchy while forgetting the pale crooked fingers that pointed the lynchers in the direction of Emmett Till or the mob that burned down Black Wall Street. They get to decry affirmative action while benefiting from it. They get the front page of Time magazine for changing the country\u2019s attitude about sexual assault while never mentioning the black woman who started the whole thing. They get to scream, \u201cBelieve all women\u201d while simultaneously calling Aurora Perrineau a goddamn liar when she says she was raped by their white friend.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe caveat of \u201cFewer white women supported Moore than supported Trump\u201d is a stupid reason to include white women among the reasons for why the molesting equestrian lost his bid for office. Saying that white women helped Moore win is like saying the Golden State Warriors won their first NBA championship because of Festus Ezeli. And I know you\u2019re wondering: \u201cWho the hell is Festus Ezeli? Did he even get in the game?\u201d\n\n\n\nExactly.\n\nYet they are proudly parading around, poking out their chests, proclaiming, \u201cWe did it.\u201d No one is saying white women didn\u2019t contribute. No one would even say they didn\u2019t work hard. They get to share the championship because they were on the team that scored the most points. But they don\u2019t get to act like they\u2019re they most valuable players.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet\u2019s be clear:\n\nBlack women are the MVPs.\n\nWhite women will tell you that all women are beautiful, delicate creatures who deserve to be protected, appreciated and placed on a pedestal.

They will cast votes for a child molester.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen they say \u201cMe too,\u201d notice the subtle emphasis on the \u201cme\u201d part.

Kelly (not to be confused with the other Best of Both Worlds tour with Hannah and Miley).\n\nThe king of R&B and Hov together, on one stage. What could go wrong?\n\nWell, just about everything.\n\nThe 40-city tour only lasted about two months. Pettiness, infighting and leaks ended with Jigga literally yelling, \u201cI don\u2019t need that nigga\u201d to a Madison Square Garden crowd and finishing the tour sans Kellz. Just because it seemed like a good idea didn\u2019t mean that the Best of Both Worlds tour needed to happen.\n\nIn yet another example of the Democratic Party mimicking but not learning from black people, it launched its own Best of Both Worlds \u201cUnity\u201d tour featuring new Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez and Bernie Sanders. It was supposed to feature the two major wings of the party coming together to resurrect Democrats in the age of Trump. Instead, it\u2019s been a PR and organizational flop. The DNC can\u2019t quite say, \u201cI don\u2019t need this nigga\u201d to Bernie Sanders, but the feeling is getting close.\n\n\n\nThere was tension from the very beginning of the tour, both ideologically and otherwise. Tom Perez was just elected DNC chair this year over Keith Ellison, whom Sanders had endorsed. Perez and Sanders\u2019 obsession with appealing to working-class white men (over the actual coalition of black women, minorities, young people and city residents that gave Hillary Clinton the majority of the popular vote) has rubbed many grassroots activists the wrong way.\n\nLastly, the weeklong tour went to Texas, Nebraska, Kentucky, Arizona, Florida, Utah and Nevada, mostly deep-red states that don\u2019t have a growing or even nominal coalition of Democratic supporters. Activists in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, states that flipped from blue to red, in large part due to voter suppression, felt snubbed as Perez and Sanders chased MAGA hats.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis tension between the speakers, the party and the grassroots boiled over to the surface, and the tour became defined more as a battle of Bernie vs. the Democrats than anything else.\n\n\u201cBernie didn\u2019t even have to do this,\u201d said Marcus Ferrell, former head of African-American outreach for the Sanders presidential campaign.\n\nFerrell points out that the ego and policy battle between the Democratic National Committee and Bernie Sanders is taking up all the headlines and discussion. This while the policies, especially those that focus on the needs of the black community, are being ignored by both sides.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c[Bernie] still has work to do on race and class issues,\u201d Ferrell said. \u201cI\u2019m ready and willing to admit that; but on the same token, we have much bigger fish to fry than a battle of Bernie vs. Democrats.\u201d\n\nThere is truth to this.\n\nRather than trying to show unity while still fighting backstage, Democrats could do a lot more to thank and support African-American voters, especially the 94 percent of black women who voted to save the world from Donald Trump. Hire more African-American women as staffers, go stump for more minority candidates, put more money into fighting voter suppression, or, better yet, state in the party platform that \u201cBlack lives matter\u201d: These are all things that could have made the Unity tour more substantive and reflective of the party\u2019s base.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut none of those things will be addressed until the egos and feelings from the primary are in check. Perez wants to get his hands on Sanders\u2019 supporters and mailing lists but doesn\u2019t want to really include the Sanders wing\u2019s policies or leadership in the rebuilding of the DNC. Democrats are angry at Sanders for callously hijacking the party, then declaring in an interview (while sitting next to Perez) that he wasn\u2019t a Democrat. His \u201ceconomics over race\u201d rhetoric has always annoyed long-term black Democrats who feel that Sanders is an opportunist. To them, Bernie Sanders is like the white sorority that forces its way into the step show, wins third place, then refuses to donate some of the prize money to the MLK awards dinner.\n\nThe consequences of this failed tour are already being felt across actual Democratic races around the country. Sanders came out stomping hard for Heath Mello, a Democratic mayoral candidate for Omaha, Neb., despite the candidate\u2019s pro-life stances. Then the DNC chair called Sanders out for his stance, then Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called out Perez and then Sanders told them all that you have to make ideological compromises to win. This coming from the same Bernie Sanders who screams, \u201cYou shall not pass\u201d to any Democrat who isn\u2019t progressive enough for his tastes\u2014despite not being a Democrat. You\u2019d think the Dems would have worked these things out before going on tour.\n\nThe Unity tour ended this week, and the Democrats haven\u2019t solved their Bernie problem, their DNC problem, their black problem or their \u201cunity\u201d problem. If there is a solution out there, maybe it can be taken from the last night of that failed concert tour in 2004.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nR. Kelly had a meltdown and ran off the stage at New York City\u2019s Madison Square Garden halfway through his set, leaving the whole show in the lurch. At this point, Jay Z had enough, he went onstage, made his proclamation and got on with the show with other artists who were ready to play. When R. Kelly tried to get back onstage, a member of Jay Z\u2019s stage crew hit him with pepper spray and the Pied Piper was done for the night.\n\nThe Democratic Party can\u2019t keep Bernie Sanders trapped in a closet, but maybe it needs to find a way to sincerely adopt his policy positions without having to deal directly with him. There\u2019s some unfinished business coming up in the 2018 midterm elections, and these problems need to be ironed out by somebody before the next tour drops.", "keywords": ["needs", "worlds", "bernie", "perez", "democrats", "party", "unity", "tour", "sanders", "stay", "best", "democratic", "closet", "black", "trapped", "dnc"], "polarity": 0.12248307248307248, "subjectivity": 0.4251089188589188},

{"url": "https://theglowup.theroot.com/body-politics-transforming-your-transformationtuesday-1821639489", "title": "/body-politics-transforming-your-transformationtuesday-", "text": "#TransformationTuesday, a popular hashtag that encourages people to share their fitness success stories, has collected more than 11 million tags on social platforms such as Instagram and Twitter. Like many, I\u2019ve indulged in my share of posts showcasing my weight-loss journey and muscle gains. But though visuals can be inspiring, they can also haunt like the Ghost of Christmas Past.\n\n\n\nSeveral statistics and articles state that up to 95 percent of people who experience rapid weight loss from dieting will experience weight gain. Despite not jumping on the diet-pill wagon or seeking a quick fix, I fell into the statistics of people who gained some of their weight back within three years. For many, gaining the weight back represents failure, and can make one feel bitter and defeated. With this in mind, I wondered: Is it possible to associate the benefits of #TransformationTuesday with nonscale victories? Let\u2019s try.\n\nConsistently Incorporate Fitness Into Your Life\n\nLess than a week ago, I came across size-inclusive fitness-clothing company Superfit Hero\u2019s Instagram account and saw its hashtag #NewFitSpo, which encourages women to reclaim their bodies and redefine what fitness inspiration looks like for themselves. Hint: It doesn\u2019t take going to the gym six days a week to attain this goal. Instead, opt to start small by increasing your activity to three times a week for 20-30 minutes a day.\n\nTake on a New Activity\n\nThere\u2019s a pair of boxing gloves that has been collecting dust on the weight bench for two years. Maybe you\u2019ve been dying to try out a yoga class, but worried about committing to monthly fees. Consider jumping on sites like Groupon to become the next Laila Ali or headstand hero (or something like that). If your pockets are still recovering from the holiday season, look into free or pay-by-donation classes within your area.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMix Healthier Dishes Into Your Diet\n\nFrankly, the word \u201cdiet\u201d scares the hell out of me, and I want no part of it. Instead, I love eating filling, flavorful dishes that prevent me from feeling stuffed. Throw some extra spinach into your omelet, or take on a #MeatlessMonday challenge that motivates you to include more vegetables and fruits in your diet. Studies show that cooking at home not only helps your diet but also may help in keeping more money in your pocket. You don\u2019t have to be a culinary guru or spend an excessive amount of time on intricate dishes. Meal prepping is helpful for everyone, from the single person juggling two jobs to a hectic family of six who crave 30 minutes of downtime.\n\nChange Up Your Makeup Routine\n\nI\u2019d like to say I\u2019m the biggest tomboy on the planet, but I have a newfound love for blending together MAC\u2019s NC-45 and NC-50 foundations to achieve my desired shade. Years ago, I found myself fascinated with watching professional makeup artists work their magic on human canvases while assisting on my husband\u2019s photography set. My curiosity slowly transitioned from picking their brains about contouring to following YouTube tutorials for a natural look. In a matter of a few months, I became pretty decent at finding lip colors and bronzers that compliment my skin. You can, too: Apply that #TransformationTuesday hashtag by unleashing your inner Destiny Godley.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShock Yourself and Wear a Bold Outfit\n\nGabrielle Union\u2019s clothing collection with New York & Co. has been reviving my womp-womp wardrobe from the dead. Her fashions have been making a chunky girl feel fat-girl-fresh for weeks! I sported one of her jumpsuits for a holiday party, and you couldn\u2019t tell me nothing; almost made me forget that I generally live in fitness gear. You can switch up your style, too: Pizzazz your life with something vibrant and different from your everyday wear. At the very least, put on some cute accessories and slay.\n\nWhat does all of this have to do with #TransformationTuesday? Every single thing. It\u2019s easy to admire all photos from strangers, wishing for the results they have. But instead of focusing on the number, let\u2019s work on the inside and allow that to shine outward.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy changing your mindset, you can passively accomplish goals without the burden of the scale or a hashtag. Your mind, body and soul are all connected. And who knows? Maybe you\u2019ll nail that #TransformationTuesday visual that you\u2019ve been longing for after all.", "keywords": ["politics", "dishes", "hashtag", "transformationtuesday", "diet", "instead", "youve", "transforming", "week", "weight", "work", "body", "fitness"], "polarity": 0.11433145470881322, "subjectivity": 0.43693702523891204},

Although the Vermont senator deserves credit for certain accomplishments\u2014pulling younger people into the political process and pushing the Democratic Party in a more progressive direction\u2014it\u2019s not as if the man had that great a shot at becoming the Democratic Party\u2019s nominee for president. Not when he was 3.7 million votes and hundreds of pledged delegates behind Hillary Clinton.\n\n\n\nFor all the fairy tales about the system being rigged and the \u201cMighty Morphin Power\u201d Democratic National Committee going against the will of the people, the reality is that more people wanted Clinton as their candidate.\n\n\n\nLast year, FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Harry Enten and Nate Silver wrote this:\n\n\n\nAs Sanders fans claim that the Democratic primary system is rigged against their candidate and that Sanders wins when turnout is higher, they fail to point out that Sanders has benefited tremendously from low-turnout caucuses. Indeed, if all the caucuses were primaries, Clinton would be winning the Democratic nomination by an even wider margin than she is now.\n\nSomehow, though, Sanders\u2019 failures as a candidate have convinced far too many people that he can solve all the party\u2019s problems. Sanders may presently be the most popular active politician in America, but that doesn\u2019t mean he has the answers to fix the Democratic Party. And what\u2019s most hilarious about this is that he\u2019s not even a Democrat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSanders said so himself Tuesday night during an interview on MSNBC\u2019s All In With Chris Hayes. Sanders is currently on a unity tour with the new DNC chairman, Tom Perez, but when asked about party affiliation, he said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m an independent.\u201d\n\nTo quote Joseline Hernandez, \u201cHo, why is you here?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIf the Democratic Party is going to succeed\u2014and I want to see it succeed\u2014it\u2019s gonna have to open its door to independents,\u201d Sanders continued. \u201cThere are probably more independents in this country than Democrats or Republicans. It\u2019s got to open its doors to working people and to young people, create a grassroots party. That\u2019s what we need.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo his credit, Democrat and Republican Party identification is at an all-time low. Moreover, Democrats do suck at mobilizing on the local level. However, many may call themselves independent, but they do have a specific ideology and, in many cases, obvious prejudices. The problem with the latter is that Sanders refuses to acknowledge just how prominent those prejudices are.\n\n\n\nAt one of those unity events in Kentucky, Sanders said this about the state of health care in the state: \u201cI suspect that the Democratic Party here in Kentucky has not done the kind of job that it should have done. It\u2019s an investment. If people are getting health care, it\u2019s an investment.\u201d\n\n\n\nMore than 500,000 Kentuckians gained access to health insurance thanks to Obamacare, only Kentucky Democrats long avoided fully embracing it because of former President Barack Obama\u2019s unpopularity in the state. In 2012 Obama barely won 38 percent of the vote, down from 41 percent in 2008. In the 2012 Democratic primary, \u201cuncommitted\u201d netted 42 percent of the vote against an unchallenged Obama. Last fall, a GOP House candidate in the state posted racist images of Obama on Facebook\u2014and then he, a preacher, not only refused to apologize but denied that the images were racist.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is the part where some\u2014hi, white readers\u2014will insert that not all white people are racist and note that there could be other variables behind Obama\u2019s popularity in states like Kentucky and West Virginia. Sure, but how many reports have we read since the last presidential election in which Tropicana Jong-il supporters are boastful about voting against their self-interests as they profess to continue to support the con they voted for? And why is that? Let me ask my black-ass friend, my trans sis or this dude I know who prays five times a day. If none of them answers, I can text this Puerto Rican bae I know.\n\n\n\nIf Sanders is to assess why Kentuckians would literally vote against their own well-being, he needs to not simply fault Democrats for not doing a good-enough job talking to the electorate. But no, as he\u2019s shown again and again, he will continue to deny the roles that racism, sexism and xenophobia played in the election.\n\n\n\nLast month Sanders said at a Boston rally with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.):\n\nSome people think that the people who voted for Trump are racists and sexists and homophobes and deplorable folks. I don\u2019t agree, because I\u2019ve been there. Let me tell you something else some of you might not agree with, it wasn\u2019t that Donald Trump won the election; it was that the Democratic Party lost the election.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet me tell you, as far as American elections go, history tells you that white people are gonna white. Yeah, yeah; not all white people are Sarah Palin or Susan Sarandon. I\u2019m not Ben Carson. I got y\u2019all. Still.\n\n\n\nThen he tweets out nonsense like this:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFaux Yoda still thinks \u201cMake America great again\u201d was about the rent and the coal rather than the racism and the sexism and the xenophobia. Yes, there are millions of people getting involved, but many of them are the people facing deportation, increased police harassment and hefty amounts of overt discrimination. The party should be catering to them, considering that if more of those darker folks had voted, we would have a President Clinton and Bernie would be saying we should primary-challenge her in 2020 (as he suggested with Obama in 2012). Sanders says a lot about reaching out to 45 voters, but what about voter disenfranchisement?\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, at this same Kentucky event, Sanders was asked about Georgia congressional candidate Jon Ossoff and whether or not he was a progressive.\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Sanders answered. \u201cIf you run as a Democrat, you\u2019re a Democrat.\u201d He added, \u201cSome Democrats are progressive, and some Democrats are not.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe statement isn\u2019t that bad, but you know, a quick Google search could\u2019ve done wonders. Moreover, considering that Democrats are really trying to get that seat (bless their hearts with this runoff), this still reads as pouring cold water on what\u2019s been a motivating story to folks in the party. But that\u2019s what happens when you let a person who isn\u2019t an actual Democrat speak about Democrats. The same can be said for placing so much faith in a person who can say that about Osoff yet endorse an anti-abortion Democratic candidate in Nebraska.\n\nSanders acts as if the Democratic Party invited him to shoot a docuseries called Bernie, Fix My Party, when, in actuality, Sanders is someone who showed up uninvited to an event and decided to stay long after the club turned the lights on. Sanders is doing well by himself with this newfound role as self-appointed savior, but ultimately, what good is this going to do for the party overall?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I wrote, \u201cShut Up, Bernie Sanders,\u201d a pool of liberal tears flooded my mentions as a bunch of \u201cBernie bros\u201d and their equally annoying homegirls seethed with anger. Criticizing Sanders doesn\u2019t make one a Hillary bot, but y\u2019all can keep up that Andrew Sullivan impersonation as long as you see fit. Nevertheless, Clinton can stay on her \u201cBitch, I Told You So\u201d tour, and the Clintons can go off into the sunset and enjoy their wealth, for all I care.\n\n\n\nFrankly, they both lost, and it\u2019s obvious why each did; but the one who performed even worse than the other election loser has managed the feat of appearing to be the one who knows all. Maybe gender is involved? Please advise.\n\nWhatever the case, if his advice includes continuing to pacify people actively engaged or complicit in multiple streams of prejudice, he can keep it. A lot of us are rightly fearing for our lives, and we\u2019re supposed to further coddle the assholes who helped create our nightmare? Even as they vote against their own well-being, to boot?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA major political party lies in peril, and one very shrewd politician has used it to further boost his own profile. Salute to you, sir, but spare me all the same. I\u2019d rather we not relive the 2016 presidential campaign. That buffoon on the right gets a lot of flak for not letting the past go, but the reality star isn\u2019t the only one who needs to let that show go already.

She also visits the polling stations and checks for names of people she knows.\n\nLeading up to Election Day, Hardy also signs up local students who attend out-of-state colleges for absentee ballots.

One of them is an \u00fcber-talented writer, artist and teacher, while the other is a nationally recognized food-justice consultant. After we\u2019d been out of touch for a while, the theme of the night was about catching up and supporting one another in next steps.\n\nTrouble is, I\u2019ve never been good at celebrating any of my accomplishments, so I sort of hemmed and hawed while trying to recount what\u2019s been going on with me. Later, in bed, I told Wifey that I felt uncomfortable talking about myself; it felt like bragging, and I just wanted to wait six months before I began celebrating some of these good moments in my life. As usual, she was ready\u2014we\u2019ve been together 18 years, and she knows me. She said to me, \u201cOne thing we have got to do is to stop putting our lives on layaway and start saying yes. Stop waiting for the future to celebrate ourselves, when we can celebrate now.\u201d\n\nThat got me thinking: What are the top five things we should say yes to in 2018?\n\n1. Friendship\n\nI\u2019ve always had a hard time making friends. Call me an adorable masculine-of-center dork, but making friends is hard, y\u2019all. I\u2019m socially awkward\u2014except online\u2014and I\u2019m also a homebody, so it complicates things when folks want to get to know me but also want to go kick it. Give me some Netflix, popcorn and a good glass of Baileys, and I\u2019m pretty much done for the night.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou don\u2019t need to say yes to everyone, but when you find people you vibe with, say yes. Get out of your comfort zone and go hang out. That said, you should make your boundaries known. For instance, I\u2019m not a club person. I only go to a club once or twice a year because I hate the scene. If your blossoming friendships favor a scene that\u2019s not ideal for you, set a boundary, then offer an alternative and find a compromise. I live in a place that has a big literary/art scene; on any given night, there\u2019s music (not in clubs), readings, spoken word, art openings. Find a spot where you can get to know your new friends offline.\n\n2. Love\n\nI\u2019ve been with Wifey for nearly 18 years, and as with any relationship, we have busy lives outside of each other, as well as up-and-down moments. In the past few years, we\u2019ve been challenged by a lot of change\u2014some pretty difficult moments, and some worth celebrating. Our love endures because we\u2019re best friends, but that\u2019s not the sexy part of who we are as a couple, and sometimes even the best relationships need a little shot in the arm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs 2017 wound down, Wifey and I agreed that we needed to step up our dating game. We\u2019ve always loved dating each other, but this new year will be a year of relationship renewal. We\u2019re both in a place where we want to challenge each other more; she is beautiful, intelligent and the kind of woman you don\u2019t want to disappoint, so I\u2019m excited to do it. Besides, we\u2019ve got the ride-or-die friendship on lock, so I look forward to trying new things\u2014both inside and outside the bedroom\u2014that kick up the spark in our romance department. It\u2019s a reboot that all relationships can benefit from. And though I haven\u2019t been single for a long time, I encourage single folks looking for excitement to say yes to exploring new love and relationships.\n\n3. Health\n\nIn November of 2015, I was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. It was a pretty difficult time for Wifey and me. The emergency room doctor told me that if I hadn\u2019t come in that weekend, I would\u2019ve had a stroke. It was a wake-up call, and for the first six months, I was really attentive to what I was eating, my exercise routine and lowering my stress. Then I lost my job and didn\u2019t keep up my routine. I\u2019ve been fat for a long time, and though I didn\u2019t look at adjusting my routine as an opportunity to lose weight, I do want to be around a little longer.\n\n\n\nThis year, I\u2019m recommitting to that routine. Again, this isn\u2019t a resolution to lose weight. We know that shit does not work. But it is a \u201cyes\u201d to just eating a little better, going bowling a little more (particularly during the winter) and, when the weather\u2019s nice, getting out in the sunshine. It also means saying yes to managing stress and anxiety, which means keeping up with therapy, finding healthy outlets like writing, and removing as many toxic people, things and unhealthy patterns from my life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Artistic Endeavors\n\nI am a writer. It has taken me a long time to say that. I\u2019m working on my second novel and have a lot of other irons in the fire. And as much as writing creates some level of stress in my life, it\u2019s the good kind of stress: It gets my mind moving and makes me feel excited and creative. I\u2019m easier to live with when I write, I\u2019m less depressed and anxious when I write, and I\u2019m simply happier when I write.\n\nMaybe writing isn\u2019t your thing\u2014maybe it\u2019s painting, sculpture, graphic design or cosplay. Whatever your particular artistic endeavor is, say yes to it. Find like-minded people who share your artistic interests and begin to make those connections: Take a class, or just go to your local craft store and start crafting. And don\u2019t let folks tell you that your particular artistic endeavor \u201cisn\u2019t really art.\u201d If it makes you smile and gives you a little pep in your step, then do it!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCreating art is not about making money (though that can be a great outcome); it\u2019s about getting what\u2019s inside you out into the world so that you can reflect and imagine. Black folk, we have wonderful imaginations but are often told to suppress our creativity. Not this year! Say yes to imagination and creativity. In a society that seeks to rob us of our joy, we need to do this.\n\n5. Your Exit Strategy\n\nIn March 2016, I lost a job I\u2019d held for close to 13 years. Even though the environment was toxic and problematic, I was devastated. Like many of us, I grounded my identity in my job. Who was I without the job?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I got a new job in August 2016, I worked hard to keep my identity separate from the gig. No matter how much I love my gig (and I do), the gig is not me and I am not the gig. I also know that\u2014as with most things\u2014jobs come to an end. Your end date may be this year, or in the next couple of years. But you should definitely say yes to crafting your exit strategy.\n\nThere\u2019s a saying that you should always walk\u2014never run\u2014away from a job. Leave on a high note, with your integrity and legacy intact. Maybe you\u2019re starting a new job in 2018; from your first day, begin to think about what you want your legacy to be when you leave, and begin to plan your exit strategy.\n\nIn a writing fellowship I was in this past year, one of the mentors had us map out our writing careers for the next five to 10 years. It was a great challenge because she asked us to dream big and then map out how we were going to get where we wanted to go.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe same goes for other careers. Ask yourself: What\u2019s next for you? What kinds of skills can you gain from this gig that can take you to the next thing? Maybe you\u2019re already in your dream job; what\u2019s your next step in the position you\u2019re in? Do you want to move up? Are you looking to start your own consulting firm, or maybe move on to another company?\n\nI also know some of us can\u2019t leave our gigs. That\u2019s a fact of life. But I encourage you not only to find inspiration in your artistic endeavors (see No. 4) but also to think about what you can do to keep yourself sane in a job you may be stuck in. Are there new projects to tackle? Are there new things to learn in your field? What is your edge in the work that you\u2019re doing? Find your niche.\n\nSaying yes to your exit strategy doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re leaving the job tomorrow. It means you\u2019re creating a plan for happiness and success, however you define it. Don\u2019t narrow your exit strategy; be bold in your creativity, map and plan\u2014ask a couple of friends to join in, and do vision boards or bullet journaling. Figure out your next steps, and you might find yourself well on your way to your next big thing!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNone of what I\u2019m telling you here is new. I mean, Shonda Rhimes told us about her Year of Yes in 2015. But maybe you were like me and didn\u2019t hear her. This year I\u2019m saying yes to these five areas of my life because I want to say yes to me. I encourage you to say yes to you, too!

After winning a close race for Democratic Party chairman, he chose his closest competitor, Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), an African-American Muslim and multiterm congressman, to become his deputy chair, a move that may be the smartest thing Democrats have done in the last two campaign cycles. It\u2019s a huge boost for African Americans in the party.\n\n\n\nThe Democratic Party is dependent on African-American voters to be successful\u2014locally, nationally and even functionally. So it made sense that the elections for the next Democratic National Committee chair, the first in the post-Obama era, would take place in Atlanta, a city that has recently snatched the \u201cChocolate City\u201d crown from Washington, D.C.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGiven the stakes at play, basically electing the leader of one of only two political parties that may run the United States, the DNC gathering was a rather low-key affair until the actual elections Saturday afternoon. The downtown Westin Hotel in Atlanta\u2019s convention district was sparsely populated, and for most of the day, the energy wasn\u2019t dissimilar to a Dunder Mifflin shareholder meeting.\n\nThe hallways were covered in campaign signs for the various DNC positions\u2014chair, vice chair and secretary\u2014and campaign teams lured you to their tables with candy, flashy buttons and Democratic swag. Walking from table to table grabbing Snickers, T-shirts and pens made it seem more like the most expensive high school student council election ever rather than the selection of the leader of a multimillion-dollar political operation.\n\nBy Saturday, election day, the temperature in the conference had jumped up considerably. Democratic luminaries showed up, including MSNBC host and former presidential candidate Al Sharpton, former Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake and actress Lynn Whitfield. There were even rumors that former Vice President Joe Biden was in the building. Prominent African-American political activists and leaders were working the room on behalf of either Ellison or Perez, although the question remained whether it would make a difference.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAll of these endorsements, they may work for some of the voting members, but not everyone,\u201d said Symone Sanders, former national press secretary for Bernie Sanders. \u201cThese are the people who are working, going to [Democratic] meetings every week, when some of these folks [endorsers] only show up at the big events.\u201d\n\nEveryone in the room believed the election would be close, with Perez having the backing of \u201cestablishment\u201d Democrats like Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, and Ellison having the backing of the Bernie Sanders wing of the party. Although many in the Congressional Black Caucus backed Perez, there was a sense right before the vote that everyone had pretty good choices.\n\nJaime Harrison, chair of the Democratic Party in South Carolina, dropped out of the DNC-chair race and endorsed Perez over Ellison. When I asked him why, he had praise for both leaders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI love Keith like a brother. Over the last year I\u2019ve come to love Tom like a brother. But it comes down to who has a better Southern strategy. Who\u2019s got a red state strategy for the Democratic Party? Tom has it.\u201d\n\nAccording to California Rep. Maxine \u201cTrump Doesn\u2019t Want Any of This\u201d Waters, either Ellison or Perez has the ability to lead the Democratic party out of the political wilderness.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who wins, they\u2019re both gonna be great for the party,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd this is a great great time for organizing against Trump. He keeps giving us fuel every day!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat kind of attitude, especially from African-American leadership in the party, seemed pretty well founded.\n\nPerez\u2019s civil rights record on discrimination, housing and immigration as a Department of Justice attorney and labor secretary is impeccable. When a 2013 Breitbart article breathlessly begs GOP members of Congress to stop your confirmation, that\u2019s a good sign.\n\nEllison was re-elected multiple times in Minnesota and has strong ties to the African-American community, labor, millennials and the party\u2019s new vibrant left. Ellison lost to Perez in a close 235-200 vote in the second round, and soon after, Perez created the position of deputy Democratic Party chair and appointed Ellison to the spot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome Democrats, particularly African Americans on the left, are less than satisfied with this. It looks like the Democratic Party is sticking with the same old conventional leadership that relies heavily on black votes but refuses to elect substantive black party leadership. The DNC already has a vice chair position, so \u201cdeputy chair\u201d may be superfluous. However, the party has enough work to go around, and there is more than enough for Perez and Ellison.\n\nDemocrats need to fight voter suppression in the Midwest, continue gains in Arizona and Texas, and pay more attention to the South, where, because of gerrymandering, the Democratic Party has become the default \u201cBlack Party.\u201d\n\nPerez knew that he needed not only to cut a deal with the Sanders wing of the party but also put to African Americans into at least a vocal leadership role in the Democratic Party. Ellison, for his part, will make sure his \u201cdeputy chair\u201d position is more than ceremonial. It seems like the Democratic Party has finally realized that ot must unify ideas and wings of the party and not just rely on the hatred of Trump to bring voters together for Democratic policy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf only they had figured this out last fall, we might have a different president in the White House.", "keywords": ["think", "victory", "perez", "chair", "africanamerican", "party", "election", "political", "bigger", "ellison", "lead", "position", "voters", "sanders", "democratic", "black", "leadership"], "polarity": 0.16264749299232062, "subjectivity": 0.43264575143885475},

I\u2019ll say it again: 63 percent of white women voted for the guy who was probably banned from a shopping mall for assaulting teenagers and for saying America was \u201cgreat\u201d during slavery. What world is this?\n\nWhite women as a modern voting block have hindered progress in this country, once again proving that they that would rather back a many times-accused pedophile and bonafide racist over literally anyone else.\ufeff\n\nApparently, an enduring one. White women\u2019s allegiance to racist, sexist, or predatory candidates is a long-standing tradition in this country and can be traced all the way back to their central role upholding white supremacy in the US\u2014stellar work they are still doing today. It was only last year that the majority of white people in this country proudly proclaimed, \u201cThe freedoms that we hold to be self-evident include a particularly skeezy kind of celebrity\u2019s ability to touch my vagina when he likes.\u201d In the 2016 election, as you\u2019ll undoubtedly remember, 63 percent of white men voted for Donald Trump, another alleged sexual abuser, as did 53 percent of white women, while 93 percent of black women and 67 percent of Latinx women supported Clinton.\n\nIn every presidential election since 1996, this pronounced gender gap has existed\u2014that is to say, most women voted for the Democratic candidate. But, in that time period, the majority of white women voters have essentially always picked the white Republican candidate\u2014no matter his utter betrayal of women, people of color, and other marginalized groups.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe white supremacy is in the pudding: In 2012, 56 percent of white women voted for Republican Mitt Romney over President Barack Obama\u2014a number that shoots to 61 percent when you count just women 45 and older, and all of whom were ostensibly won over\u2014or at least not discouraged\u2014by their candidate\u2019s binders full of women. In 2008, 53 percent of white women voted for John McCain, a consistently anti-choice politician who once told a joke about a woman enjoying being raped by an ape\u2014even though in both 2012 and 2008, Obama carried the female vote. In 2004, 55 percent of white women voted for the \u201cstealth misogyny\u201d of George W. Bush. In 2000, 90 percent of black voters voted for Al Gore, as did 63 percent of Latinx voters, according to Colorlines. Still, 49 percent of white women voted for George W. Bush, one point more than for Gore.\n\nWhite women\u2019s voting penchants go all the way back to the elections of Ronald Reagan, which introduced the term \u201cgender gap\u201d into the national political consciousness. In the 1984 election, Reagan won 54 percent of the men\u2019s vote, but only 46 percent of the women\u2019s vote\u2014a gap attributed, again, to minority women: 93 percent of black women, 73 percent of Jewish women, and 65 percent of Latinx women voted for Walter Mondale and his vice president Geraldine Ferraro.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn many respects, white American women voters have proven to be interested in one thing: maintaining the status quo.\n\nBut you\u2019ve already heard this story: white women picked the white guy\u2014despite his complete disregard for the LGBTQ community battling the AIDS crisis, his opposition to the Equal Rights Amendment (though, of course, Phyllis Schafly, the ultimate rendering of this kind of \u201cfamily values\u201d-driven white woman, famously led a charge against it too), and his desire to eliminate a slew of entitlements that benefited non-white voters. That\u2019s not even to mention the allegations that came out in 1991 from actress Selene Walters that Reagan raped her in the early \u201950s.\n\nIn many respects, white American women voters have proven to be interested in one thing: maintaining the status quo, which comes at the expense of everyone who doesn\u2019t currently benefit from it. \u201cWhen we\u2019re talking about the \u2018women\u2019s vote,\u2019 it\u2019s very rare we\u2019re talking about issues on top of the agenda for women of color, poor women, and LGBT women,\u201d Juliet Williams, a UCLA political theorist and gender studies professor, told Broadly last year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, truly, anyone but them. White women as a modern voting block have hindered progress in this country, once again proving that they would rather back a many times-accused pedophile and bonafide racist over literally anyone else.\n\n\n\nTheories about why this is abound. In a 2016 article in The Atlantic, Michelle Cottle attributes white women\u2019s unyielding devotion to voting Republican to sheer partisanship\u2014she writes that many women can\u2019t get it up for traditional \u201cwomen\u2019s issues\u201d like adequate family leave and equal pay, that they\u2019d rather vote for a president who\u2019s tough on immigration or taxes. She also notes that hardcore Republicans and Democrats find it nearly impossible to switch to the other side. In a 2012 New Yorker piece, John Cassidy also tries his hand at this riddle, discussing wealth, age, and religion as potential factors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nthey have something\u2014status, an often false sense of security, a harkening back to Traditional Values\u2014to lose.\n\nAnd it\u2019s true, money seems to cut more cleanly than gender. The wealthier white women who vote Republican, and who voted for Roy Moore on Tuesday evening weren\u2019t voting to expand access to birth control or abortion, or for a commitment to civil rights and criminal justice reform\u2014they have nothing to gain with increased access to civic services. Rather, crucially, they have something\u2014status, an often false sense of security, a harkening back to Traditional Values\u2014to lose.\n\nMoore, and the GOP that endorsed him, recognized this fear of loss and, brandishing his petite gun onstage, offered a vague idea of protection: from immigrants, from the country\u2019s alleged declining moral center, from the loss of family, as well as a vague slate of values: Life. Security. Work. In short: keeping white people on top. And they voted for it in droves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCertainly these fears and \u201cwhite anxiety\u201d are not based in religiosity (remember: pedophilia). This means that, to many, the urgent desire to uphold white supremacy and all that goes with it must trump one\u2019s desire to create a society that\u2019s safe for all women. Perhaps, imagining something we\u2019ve never had is less immediately tangible\u2014less urgent\u2014than the loss of something sinister from which white women have benefited their entire life.", "keywords": ["republican", "voting", "women", "vote", "white", "gender", "voted", "fucking", "voters", "country", "womens"], "polarity": 0.06668133718133716, "subjectivity": 0.346119227994228},

I mean, we were Christians, technically, but Christianity, in our house, felt like more of a benevolent and perfunctory directions guide than any sort of edict. I was taught to pray before every meal\u2014a ritual I still follow today. The Lord\u2019s name was never to be said in vain. And there were Bibles around, somewhere. But we never actually went to church ourselves. The only time I went was for funerals and if I happened to be spending the night at one of my grandparents\u2019 houses. (Also, I went to Catholic school from sixth to eighth grade, and I\u2019d attend Mass when it was Mass-attending time.)\n\nWe did, however, worship at the church of Kool-Aid. And the only reason I\u2019m comparing Kool-Aid consumption to religious beliefs is to give you an accurate measure of how fanatic about Kool-Aid we were. If you were to randomly peek into our refrigerator at any point, you\u2019d likely find orange juice and you\u2019d probably find milk, but you\u2019d definitely, absolutely find a half-gallon container of Kool-Aid. If it wasn\u2019t in there, it was because it was currently being made. And if it wasn\u2019t currently being made, there was definitely a conversation happening about who drank the last of the Kool-Aid because that person is slacking on their Kool-Aid restocking duties.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe were so fanatical that I can tell you which flavors go best with certain types of meats. For steaks and burgers, grape is the best choice. If you\u2019re eating seafood, orange. And if you\u2019re eating poultry, you\u2019ll need a glass of red Kool-Aid to best wash that bitch down.\n\nMy Kool-Aid fever stretched into adulthood. Because I loved and was addicted to the way it tastes. But also because it\u2019s cheap as fuck. You can buy 29,000 packets for, like, a nickel. And not only did I buy the normal grapes and oranges and reds\u2014I also bought the slightly off-brand flavors like red cherry and raspberry and the shit they clearly only sold as an experiment to see if niggas would buy it, like bacon-blueberry and pistachio. In my first apartment\u2014a 600-square-foot space on the corner of Ellsworth and Negley in Shadyside\u2014the only things you\u2019d always find in my fridge were bacon, eggs, creamy Caesar salad dressing, orange juice and Kool-Aid.\n\nAnd then one day that all changed.\n\nIn my apartment were two women I\u2019d recently met. I offered them something to drink. One of them asked what I had in my fridge. I told her Kool-Aid. She replied:\n\n\u201cNigga, you still drinking Kool-Aid?\u201d\n\nNow, as veteran \u201cnigga\u201d users know, \u201cnigga\u201d is not a word that you typically use haphazardly with black people you just met. It\u2019s a term of familiarity\u2014not something you say when answering an innocent question from a nigga you just met three days before. But that \u201cnigga\u201d was used to articulate how disappointed she was that I was drinking Kool-Aid, and how annoyed she was that I had the audacity to offer it to her. Basically, I was Kool-Aid-shamed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd it worked. By the end of that year, it was no longer a part of my daily consumption. I stopped buying it, and would only drink it when I visited my parents. And now I live a Kool-Aid-free life, replacing it with room temperature bottled water and lukewarm whiskey.\n\nBut although I\u2019ve come to realize how bad it is for you\u2014it\u2019s just sugar and water and literally nothing else\u2014I miss it from time to time. Particularly when I\u2019m eating chicken. I\u2019ve also realized, over the last few years, that Kool-Aid is quite a polarizing topic. It doesn\u2019t quite reach the level of the grit wars or the jollof-rice wars, but it\u2019s close. Just admitting that you do (or don\u2019t) drink Kool-Aid\u2014and when or why you started or stopped\u2014is the black equivalent of the Myers-Briggs. Everything that needs to be known about you can be told through your feelings about it and your experience with it.\n\nAnyway, I want to hear about your Kool-Aid experiences.

But this time, he didn\u2019t hold back on his frustration with some of his fellow Democrats.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWinning\u2019s everything,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t win, you can\u2019t make the public policy.

But, mostly, as a light-skinned, nonbiracial, hopefully self-aware black woman, I felt painfully aware that conversations about colorism are still uncomfortable for me\u2014and, often, should be.\n\nThose aren\u2019t \u201clight-skinned tears\u201d\u2014or light-skinned guilt\u2014just a simple admission that I\u2019m occasionally challenged by how to honestly and effectively address privilege and oppression in the same space and breath. Because while I can readily acknowledge the many ways my privilege overrides my oppression\u2014including the \u201cpretty privilege\u201d that afforded me a modeling career (albeit as a plus model, which is another story)\u2014it\u2019s a balancing act to do so without throwing my own experiences under the bus. (Because contrary to the popular belief espoused above, light-skinned women aren\u2019t actually \u201cbroken down that easy.\u201d)\n\nBut it\u2019s necessary work and therefore, a discussion I continue to have with myself. I\u2019d hope (wish?) that white women would have similar discussions with themselves as they approach the intersection of racism and feminism, and that black men would do the same as they consider the benefits and functions of patriarchy, as well as cis-hetero white men in relation to ... well, everyone else.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd so on, and so on. ... For instance, if you\u2019re reading this, you\u2019re enjoying a first-world, net-neutral (for now) privilege, in and of itself. But the best way to deconstruct someone else\u2019s privilege and resulting pathology is to first make sense of your own. You know\u2014oxygen masks, and all that.\n\nAnd what better place to have that conversation than here at The Glow Up?\n\nVeronica Webb and I crafted this space with a mission: to represent, inspire and empower all iterations of black womanhood. How can we do that by ignoring the rainbow in the room? And no, that doesn\u2019t just mean simply addressing the issues and needs of our LGBTQ sisters, but the full spectrum of shades in which black women arrive, whenever and wherever they enter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am not ignorant or dismissive of the optics: No matter how well-meaning or qualified, can two black women privileged in seemingly similar ways ensure that The Glow Up will be\u2014for lack of a less-clich\u00e9d word\u2014inclusive?\n\nThree weeks in, we\u2019re a work in progress, and I hope we always will be. Even during our brief tenure, we\u2019ve already faced concerns of elitism and being too \u201ckumbaya\u201d about colorism. So this video inspired me to initiate a conversation we all need to be more comfortable having. And before we continue, maybe it\u2019s best to start by saying what many of us wish had been said, in so many instances:\n\nI believe you.\n\nWhatever your experience with colorism is, it\u2019s not for me to explain away, or turn into something more comfortable for me to digest. I will not use denial to \u201cwhat about\u201d anyone into submission. My job\u2014especially here\u2014is to listen, observe, empathize when possible, act when necessary and to trust what I\u2019m hearing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI believe you. I hope you\u2019ll believe me, too.\n\n\n\nBecause while I\u2019m not \u201ckumbaya\u201d enough to think that belief alone is enough to heal the damage of colorism, I am humble enough to admit that I don\u2019t know what I don\u2019t know. I know I\u2019ve been fetishized because of my color more than I\u2019ve been rejected. I know I\u2019ve been rejected, in turn. I also know that I can\u2019t speak for anyone\u2019s experience but my own; but above all else, I know that this shit does a deep disservice to us all\u2014especially us women.\n\nWhen I shared this film with a few colleagues, one of them questioned its effectiveness, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t understand what this video is trying to do. It\u2019s just a bunch of insults while images of normal, attractive women stand around.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdmittedly, I agree. So, when I ask how a film like the one above makes you feel, it\u2019s because we need to know, and we need to talk about it. We need to be honest about where this ongoing issue sits in our bodies, and under our skins, individually and collectively. And then we need to believe one another. As a colored girl, I need to be able to speak, write and think openly about colorism\u2014and I still have much to learn.

On Tuesday the Alabama Senate race took place. Roy Moore, a repugnant alleged serial child molester who believes that women should not have the right to vote, civil rights should be scrapped and slavery was lit, lost by a hair. Doug Jones, Moore\u2019s opponent, was carried to victory by black folks\u2014specifically black women. Exit polls showed that 98 percent of black women voted for Jones, as compared with 93 percent of black men, 35 percent of white women and 27 percent of white men.\n\n\n\nListen closely. Do you hear it? That, my friend, is the sound of hundreds upon thousands of black women letting out a resounding \u201cWe tried to tell y\u2019all.\u201d\n\nEvery time there is something good in this world\u2014know that black women probably did it first, said it first, seent it first. Someone was so sure about this that they put it on a T-shirt. Conversely, most negative things in this world, black women tried to save you from.\n\nIt was Anita Hill who exposed the predatory nature of men on Capitol Hill, long before Monica Lewinsky\u2019s heels ever stepped on the carpets of the Oval Office. It was Tarana Burke who sent the first #MeToo into the world, 10 years before the movement was appropriated by white feminism. Twenty years prior to the pink pussy hats that filled the streets of our nation\u2019s capital, 750,000 black women gathered for their Million Woman March.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFurthermore, black women were the only demographic that vehemently opposed the election of Donald Trump, and exemplified that in their votes. And 94 percent of black women voted for Hillary Clinton\u201412 more percentage points than black men and over 20 more percentage points than the Latina and Latino population. It is unclear why J. Cole\u2019s \u201cNo Role Modelz\u201d isn\u2019t consistently at the top of the charts\u2014because clearly, this nation don\u2019t wanna be saved.\n\nTrump\u2019s slogan betrays him because it belongs to black women. We have been trying to make America great from the jump. So much nonsense could be avoided if this nation listened to us. There is something unique about black women. Like our male counterparts, we built this nation. However, black women also raised it. We nursed and bathed its children\u2014both black and white\u2014fed its workforce and cleaned its households. We know more about black men, white men and white women than they know about themselves. Therefore, we are in a special position to predict the unknown, advise the unknowledgeable and reshape the unseen future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt would seem that these traits would make America treasure us, holding us up as a pinnacle of wisdom. Instead, as Malcolm X said:\n\nThe most disrespected person in America is the black woman. The most unprotected person in America is the black woman. The most neglected person in America is the black woman.\n\nAnd that\u2019s on a good day. Let\u2019s take a closer look.\n\nThe most disrespected person in America is the black woman.\n\nAs black women, policed by Eurocentric beauty standards, we are routinely attacked for our appearances. Michelle Obama, Rep. Maxine Waters and Leslie Jones are just a few examples of black women whom the internet and media have dragged for filth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur spirited personalities are denounced as inappropriately dominant. Our strong leadership is constantly reduced to words like \u201ccontrolling\u201d and \u201cpushy,\u201d rather than being seen for what it is: dynamic.\n\nSojourner Truth, in her \u201cAin\u2019t I a Woman\u201d speech, conveyed that society claims that women are to be coddled, put on a pedestal and given the best treatment that society has to offer, but no one ever does that for black women. In fact, when it is done for black women, it\u2019s \u201ccorny\u201d\u2014what people call Russell Wilson\u2019s excellent treatment of Ciara. Aren\u2019t we women, too? Do we not deserve to be cherished?\n\n\n\nThe most unprotected person in America is the black woman.\n\nSince slavery, the black woman has been unprotected. We bore whips and savage rape from white slave masters. Our children were ripped away from us and sold as property. We became the targets of forced sterilization, the government\u2019s horrific plan for population control. Our households\u2019 resources waned under the strain of the systemic underemployment and mass incarceration of black men.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPresently, our own community has the audacity to continue this heinous legacy. Sixty percent of black girls experience sexual abuse at the hands of black men before the age of 18. Yet these perpetrators rarely face consequences, because black women instinctively protect black men from white supremacy and imprisonment. Intimate-partner violence is the leading cause of death for black women. Yet these victims are rarely depicted as innocent but, rather, as emasculating, domineering, mouthy instigators.\n\nWe are even punished if we try to protect ourselves, like Marissa Alexander, who received 20 years in prison for firing a warning shot into the air to ward off her violent ex-spouse, or Cyntoia Brown, who is serving a life sentence for shooting a man who purchased her for sex from a sex trafficking ring when she was 16.\n\nBlack Women in Alabama Saved Themselves Last Night If you\u2019ve kept up with how black women roll in American politics, what happened in Alabama last\u2026 Read more Read\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe most neglected person in America is the black woman.\n\nBlack women are often erased from movements we create and/or prop up. Why is it that we can rattle off facts about Malcolm, Martin and Medgar, but rarely hear about the women of the civil rights movement? It was Amelia Boynton who wrote to Martin Luther King Jr., convincing him to come to Selma, Ala., yet there is no mention of her in most movies and textbooks. It was Autherine Lucy Foster who suggested laying Jimmie Lee Jackson\u2019s body on the steps of the Alabama state Capitol, but the idea is often credited to James Bevel. Men may have been the faces of this movement, but women were the strategists.\n\nAfter the 2016 presidential election, white women rushed to adorn Susan B. Anthony\u2019s grave with \u201cI Voted\u201d stickers, but where were the stickers for Shirley Chisholm, Fannie Lou Hamer, Sojourner Truth, Ida B. Wells and Mary Church Terrell\u2014who fought for women\u2019s right to vote even when the racist suffrage movement left them out?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is mirrored today. The Black Lives Matter movement, founded by three black women, is often tied to DeRay Mckesson and Shaun King. #MeToo was founded by Tarana Burke, a black woman, yet its appropriation by white women leaves people out who look like its very founder. White utterances of #MeToo have stripped some of the most notorious men of their power and influence, yet when Lupita Nyong\u2019o and Aurora Perrineau came forward, they were swiftly decried as liars. Black women must alway work twice as hard to get half as far and hope that no one falsely claims even that small victory for themselves.\n\nMaya Pope described America\u2019s relationship with black women best in Scandal\u2019s season 6 finale:\n\nI tell you \u2026 being a black woman. \u201cBe strong,\u201d they say. Support your men. Raise a man. Think like a man. Well, damn. I gotta do all that? Who\u2019s out here working for me? Carrying my burden? Building me up when I get down? Nobody. Black women out here trying to save everybody. We still try. Try to help all y\u2019all, even when we get nothing. God forbid you let a sista like me help you out. No, you don\u2019t want that. Don\u2019t let me put you on my back when you fall, wipe the crust out of your eye, put a pep back in your step. Because when we do, you resent us for making you better, smarter, stronger; then drop us so you can be with someone basic. Someone without all that baggage you left us with. But we still try.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nW.E.B. Du Bois once said that on judgment day, he would forgive slavery, but what he could never forgive was the \u201cpersistent insulting of black womanhood.\u201d And neither can I.

Trump is what happens when a nation lies to itself about the depth of its character.\n\nAnd as the hand-wringing \u201cHow did this happen\u201d hysteria reaches full force, that has never been more apparent than in this moment. Since August of last year, it has been clear that a Trump presidency was possible. He is neither an anomaly nor some freak of nature, but an embodiment of everything that the United States tries to pretend it is not.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut what we have seen in the hours since Trump\u2019s victory is white America\u2014particularly the underwhelming number of white women who showed up for Hillary Clinton\u2014refusing to admit how deeply embedded white supremacy is in the fabric of this country and how deeply racist some of their sister suffragettes are.\n\nInstead, too many of them are trying to blame anyone and anything for Hillary Clinton\u2019s Electoral College loss\u2014third parties, nonvoters, the FBI, Russia, WikiLeaks\u2014anything except whiteness.\n\nThese things may have factored into the outcome\u2014as did voter suppression across the country in the wake of the 2013 Supreme Court decision to gut the Voting Rights Act\u2014but they didn\u2019t determine the outcome. White America is supremely uncomfortable facing itself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the \u201cBlack voters will be a problem for Clinton\u201d narrative was proved false, mainstream media quickly pivoted to describing working-class white voters as the victims of this election. MSNBC\u2019s Chris Matthews has been one the most ardent voices insisting that white voters in the Rust Belt felt \u201cabandoned\u201d and that that\u2019s the reason Trump was able to upset the Clinton establishment.\n\nWe, of course, can talk about these \u201csalt-of-the-earth\u201d white men whom Matthews and others have romanticized. We can talk about Clinton not fitting into the anti-war, anti-corporate progressive movement that is happening among white Bernie Sanders voters who have discovered revolution. But to focus solely on these two groups is a deflection from what exit polls show and what many of us already knew. Despite the prevailing liberal elitist argument that illiterate, backwoods crackers elected Trump, the lie-detector test determined that that is a lie\u2014or, at the very least, not completely true.\n\nThis nation can be under no illusions here: Trump appealed to overt white supremacy, patriarchy and hypercapitalism and turned almost the entire map red.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe won because wealthy white men wanted to solidify their power. He won because the most educated white people wanted to ensure their dominance. He won because, overwhelmingly, white women secretly hate powerful white women when they do not have that power in their own lives or in their own homes\u2014but, also, because many white women, despite their collective cries of victimhood, are also undercover white supremacists.\n\nIt is past time that these undercover, \u201cnice\u201d racists\u2014the two-faced electorate that claims blue but turns red when the lights go off\u2014are called out. More importantly, it is past time that we reckon with the reality that W.E.B. Du Bois warned us about in 1956: \u201cDemocracy has so far disappeared in the United States that no \u2018two evils\u2019 exist. There is but one evil party with two names, and it will be elected despite all I can do or say.\u201d\n\nClinton has already told her supporters to respect democracy and the \u201cpeaceful transfer of power.\u201d During her concession speech, she implored liberals and progressives to approach the next four years with an open mind and give Trump the \u201cchance to lead\u201d\u2014despite the expectation that he will sentence justice to the death penalty and women\u2019s rights to the trash bin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd in his response to Trump\u2019s win, President Barack Obama said, \u201cWe have to remember that we\u2019re all on one team. This is an intramural scrimmage. We\u2019re not Democrats first. We\u2019re not Republicans first. We are Americans first. We\u2019re patriots first.\u201d\n\nSee, our so-called democracy may demand negative peace and complicity masquerading as collective advancement in order to survive, but somebody lied. We are not \u201call on one team,\u201d and we never have been. This is why this farce of a two-party system must be dismantled\u2014so Democrats and Republicans can stop scrimmaging while people\u2019s lives are at stake.\n\nThe middle ground of centrism has always included covert concessions to white supremacy, which is what makes it so dangerous for the most-targeted and vulnerable communities of color in this country. Over the course of the election cycle, the Democratic Party did all it could to ridicule and suppress progressive voices, while seeking to \u201cunderstand\u201d and create space for the \u201cbasket of deplorables\u201d that have been let off their leashes across the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack activists were asking for too much; immigration activists were asking for too much; indigenous tribes were asking for too much; working-class people were asking for too much. And #NeverTrump provided a shield. White liberals didn\u2019t have to be anti-racist, they just had to be \u201cwith her,\u201d and there were many of them who became angry and condescending and as openly antagonistic as Trump supporters when they were told that just being \u201cwith her\u201d wasn\u2019t enough.\n\nContrary to popular opinion, I do not believe that Trump is a far-right-wing ideologue, and have consistently said that Mike Pence, and even Ted Cruz, were dangerous in more insidious ways. No, Trump is a morally bankrupt entertainer for sale who trafficked in racism, wallowed in corruption and incited white nationalist violence across the country to gain power.\n\nAs I wrote previously, \u201cTrump supporters are either frenzied with rage and bigotry or rationalizing rage and bigotry; there is no in-between,\u201d and the Democrats are in the market for those votes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1992, Bill Clinton siphoned white supremacist capitalist votes away from the GOP and ushered in the Democratic Party\u2019s Third Way era. He became the overseer of mass incarceration, which still has its tentacles embedded in communities of color\u2014and the strategy was to create a coalition with moderate, St. Reagan-loving Republicans who just wanted to make America great again.\n\nSo, what does that mean in today\u2019s social-political climate?\n\nIt means that white America is having a conversation with itself. People of color are welcome to join that conversation\u2014for appearances\u2014but they won\u2019t be welcome to change it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt means that welfare reform will once again become a Democratic issue, as it did under Bill Clinton. It means that for-profit prisons are back in business\u2014bigly. It means that Big Business\u2122 will openly take its seat at the Democratic table that it owns. Whatever needs to be done, whatever machinations are needed to put the party back in power in the 2018 midterms and beyond, will be employed.\n\nThe diversification of white supremacy will continue to be central to the party\u2019s strategy. There will be new black faces, new Latinx faces, new female faces, but there will be no serious campaign talk of social justice or criminal-justice reform or environmental racism because the party has picked its white pigeon to pluck. There will be no serious talk of humane and progressive immigration strategy; in fact, we\u2019ll hear more and more about enforcement. President Obama\u2019s legacy of night raids, detentions and deportations\u2014which could explain why Trump received more of the Latinx vote than Mitt Romney in 2012\u2014will continue.\n\nAs close as the vote was in battleground states, there was a chance that embracing a Poor People\u2019s Campaign in the tradition of Martin Luther King Jr. and Marian Wright Edelman would have changed the outcome for Hillary Clinton.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere was a chance that a stronger anti-imperialist campaign, including a commitment to protecting the rights and lands of indigenous people, would have swayed a few votes on the left.\n\nThere was a chance that a stronger commitment to divest from police departments and make them pay the consequences of their militarized occupations in communities of color would have driven the black vote percentage up by a few points.\n\nThere was a chance that a stronger commitment to fight for health care, education and economic equity in the rural, red South would have swayed some votes Clinton\u2019s way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead, in the age of Black Lives Matter; the Sanders revolution; and indigenous, immigration and global movements for freedom and justice, the Democratic Party continued to bet on lukewarm liberalism\u2014a move transparent to both the left and the right\u2014and lost to a white supremacy that never compromises. And if history tells the tale\u2014and the mainstream media narrative being spun at this very moment takes root\u2014it is clear that the party is not going to take any chances.\n\nNow, as the fox and the wolf collude in the interest of \u201cdemocracy,\u201d everyone invested in this political duopoly will have to decide which deals to make with the devil\u2014but first we must call it by name.\n\nGood morning, America.

Per usual, black women showed up and showed out at the ballot box, helping Doug Jones win Jeff Sessions\u2019 vacated Senate seat in what was supposed to be a safe victory for Republican candidate Roy Moore.\n\nAll against robust voter-suppression efforts.\n\nA Washington Post exit poll shows that 98 percent of black women voted for Jones, compared with the 63 percent of white women who voted for Moore, a man who faces accusations from several women claiming that he sexually assaulted them as teenagers. It is clear that black women are the moral force of America. Let\u2019s keep it 100. Black women knew the stakes were high. Had Moore won, he would have been one more pro-Donald Trump degenerate black people had to contend with.\n\nBlack women said, \u201cNah, we gon\u2019 come out and take care of this mess.\u201d\n\nThey have always been enthusiastic about voting, as evidenced by the fact that they have outvoted black men since 1984 (pdf). Social protests, namely the shooting deaths of black men by police officers, have already energized black women to hit the streets. That they would harness that same energy to ensure that a racist woman hater would not win a Senate seat should surprise no one.\n\n\u201cBlack women have been leading in grassroots organizing that\u2019s been happening across the South and the nation for several years, particularly since the Trayvon Martin case,\u201d said Bree Newsome, an activist who made international news for scaling a flag post to take down a Confederate flag in South Carolina in 2015. \u201cMany interpret the resistance as having begun in January of 2017, but what we are seeing now is the electoral result of long-term organizing efforts spearheaded by black women. We were actively resisting racism and sexism before Trump and the Alabama Senate race.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nComparatively, white female voters in Alabama proved, yet again, that they cannot be trusted. Essentially, as they did in the 2016 presidential election, white women chose their race over their gender. Upholding white supremacy and patriarchy is still their priority. It is understandable why so many of us declared that \u201cblack women saved America.\u201d\n\nBut let\u2019s be real. White women in Alabama did not really want to be saved. They voted for an alleged child molester. In reality, black women care about themselves and their futures. Republicans in the U.S. Senate support a tax bill that purges the middle class and rally behind a president who attacks Obamacare, which black women rely on and white women need, but they\u2019re too blinded by their racism to realize it.\n\nMeanwhile, #BlackWomen is trending on Twitter, celebrating the organizing power of black female voters. Black women took time to remind readers of what the next steps should be:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking of some of the \u201cy\u2019all,\u201d I asked Leah Wright Rigueur, a professor at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School of Government, why so many white women backed Moore despite his alleged history of sexual assault:\n\nMany do so for complicated reasons, including the fact that they\u2019ve voted Republican their entire life and can\u2019t envision voting for a Democrat. Others do so for less complicated reasons: They support the Republican agenda and therefore will support whatever candidate holds the GOP banner aloft. And then, of course, you have people that will tie themselves in knots to try and rationalize their support of Moore, when, at the end of the day, it boils down to fact that they believe what Moore believes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoom.\n\nBlack women didn\u2019t do this just for Jones or America or the Democratic Party. It\u2019s not as if the relationship is reciprocal in the first place. Black women showed up last night because they are the most eager for progressive change, even though they have historically gotten little in return for it. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) is the only black woman in the U.S. Senate, and black women make up a mere 3.6 percent of Congress, according to Higher Heights. They make up just 3.7 percent of state legislators nationwide and 14.7 percent of all female state legislators in the country. There are only two black lieutenant governors in the union (both men), and no state has ever elected a black female governor. (Ahem, Democratic National Committee, there is a black woman named Stacey Abrams running for Georgia governor.)\n\nMoreover, black women make 63 cents (pdf) of the white man\u2019s dollar, despite being head of the household for more than 50 percent of families with children under 18. They suffer the highest mortality rates after childbirth, and 12 percent (pdf) are uninsured, twice the rate of white women. It\u2019s as if black women keep investing in the Democrats\u2019 stock but get almost no cashable return.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd while praise for black women on Twitter this morning abounds, people should consider how to look at black female voters beyond being mules for the Democratic Party.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a difference between \u2018Black women should do the work\u2019 and \u2018We need to support black women who are doing work,\u2019\u201d said L. Joy Williams, chairwoman of Higher Heights. \u201cIt needs to come with resources and actual support, and not just tweets and retweets and a hashtag.\u201d\n\nThe days of simply thanking black women for saving the day and giving them nothing in return must end. Black women running for office at all levels need money. Lots of it. The DNC needs to appoint them to positions of power in Washington, D.C., and at the local and state levels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe next step is for, not only the DNC, [but] the DCCC [Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee], DSCC [Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee] and all of the Democratic operations ... to evaluate how much of their resources they are going to invest into black women and voters in general way before we get to the end of 2018,\u201d Williams added.\n\nThat is the best thank-you the party and America could offer them.", "keywords": ["women", "white", "night", "voted", "support", "saved", "moore", "voters", "alabama", "senate", "democratic", "black", "female"], "polarity": 0.0004219077568134182, "subjectivity": 0.35432315064390524},

I love Jesus, too; still, the holiday season overlaps with cuffing season, and with all that cold weather and love in the air, you are likely to spend your time either drinking eggnog while laid up with the one you love or sipping something dark and flavorful contemplating why you\u2019re alone on Christmas Eve. Musical artists know this\u2014that is why there is an embarrassment of riches when it comes to brown-liquor Christmas songs.\n\nAs I stated before, in order for a track to qualify as a \u201cbrown liquor\u201d song, it must meet certain criteria:\n\nIt must have a pronounced bass line.\n\nThis bass line must be contrasted with an ethereal harmony.\n\nThe sonic tension between these juxtapositions must evoke a mood that is either libidinous or mournful in nature.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet for it to qualify as a brown-liquor Christmas song, it must do Nos. 1 to 3 while also commenting upon or utilizing symbols of the holiday season. This can be done by a) turning a traditional Christmas song into a brown-liquor song (see: the Temptations\u2019 \u201cSilent Night\u201d); b) taking a symbol of Christmas and using it in playful and libidinous ways (see: Clarence Carter\u2019s \u201cBack Door Santa\u201d); or c) using Christmas as a setting to lament the one who got away (see: Luther\u2019s \u201cEvery Year, Every Christmas\u201d).\n\nMany Christmas songs qualify, but below, I present to you the 10 best brown-liquor Christmas songs of all time, ranked.\n\n\n\n10. \u201cMerry Christmas Baby,\u201d by Kenny Burrell\n\nThis is a soulful and jazzy cover of the Johnny Moore\u2019s Three Blazers classic. It\u2019s perfect background music for when you have friends over and you\u2019re mixing up amaretto sours.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. \u201cMy Favorite Things,\u201d by John Coltrane\n\nI\u2019m a jazz snob. I don\u2019t do the cheap, elevator-music-adjacent Kenny G bastardization of the black-American art form. If it doesn\u2019t push the boundaries of melody, then you can miss me with your whitewashed, sweet-white-wine shenanigans. \u201cMy Favorite Things\u201d by \u2019Trane is a 13-minute encounter with the divine. It is a masterpiece and perfect with a hot buttered bourbon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. \u201cSanta Claus Wants Some Loving,\u201d by Albert King\n\nEven Santa has needs. This raunchy jawn is your crazy uncle\u2019s second-favorite Christmas song. He drinks Jim Beam out the bottle while he listens to it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. \u201cEvery Year, Every Christmas,\u201d by Luther Vandross\n\nLuther\u2019s voice was one of a kind. \u201cIntimate,\u201d \u201csultry\u201d and \u201cvelvety\u201d don\u2019t do it justice, and his voice is on full display as he sings about how the holiday is a source of pain because his lover is not with him. Sip this with Crown Royal and ginger ale. Be sure you don\u2019t get tears in the glass.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. \u201cA Child Is Born,\u201d by Oscar Peterson\n\nThis is a quiet, mournful jazz standard written by composer Alec Wilder and trumpeter Thad Jones. On this cover, Peterson improvises on the melody, filling out the sonic landscape of the song in ways that make it both soulful and melancholic. Watch the snowfall as you listen to this and drink a Swedish glogg.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. \u201cPlease Come Home for Christmas,\u201d by Charles Brown\n\nThis is the official Christmas song of juke joints and liquor houses everywhere. Charles Brown\u2019s vocalizations put one in the mood to sip something brown and aged while yearning for the one who got away. Pair this with a Macallan 18-year, straight, no chaser.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. \u201cSilent Night,\u201d by the Temptations\n\nThe Temptations\u2019 rendition of this Christmas classic is a soulful blend of the sacred and the secular. Listening to Glenn Leonard makes me do the ugly church face ubiquitous in black houses of worship. This is your spiked-apple-cider song.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. \u201cLet It Snow,\u201d by Boyz II Men\n\nChristmas is in winter, and winter is cuffing season. I contend that \u201cLet It Snow\u201d is the definitive sexy Christmas song. \u201cThe market is full of widely recognized artists singing the usual classics,\u201d says Elon Dancy, professor of education and associate dean for community engagement and academic inclusion at the University of Oklahoma. He is a scholar world-renowned for his research into black men in higher education but is also an underappreciated cultural critic. He continues, \u201cHowever, one of the special contributions of Christmas Interpretations is that the majority of the album is original Christmas music \u2026 it is musical velvet.\u201d Keep warm as this plays by sipping a spiked hot chocolate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. \u201cBack Door Santa,\u201d by Clarence Carter\n\nOn this track, Carter is petty, trifling and brilliant. That\u2019s why this is your crazy uncle\u2019s favorite Christmas song. He gets fancy, says, \u201cWhat you young bucks know \u2019bout dis right cha,\u201d and drinks Courvoisier out of a snifter as he grooves to this.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. \u201cThis Christmas,\u201d by Donny Hathaway\n\nMuch has been said about this track, so I will just stress to you how strongly I feel that this is the official Christmas song of black folks everywhere. This joint is suitable for every occasion and pairs with any drink.

Yet since their inception, HBCUs have been in a war for their very existence, whether facing Congress or state legislatures.\n\nHBCUs have even found themselves repeatedly at odds with President Barack Obama. As economist and author Julianne Malveaux, former president of Bennett College, said in an interview this summer with Roland Martin on the Obama administration, \u201cThere was insensitivity to HBCUs and a sense that we didn\u2019t \u2018deserve\u2019 [federal] money.\u201d\n\nStill, during this election cycle, presidential candidates have used HBCUs as backdrops to garner the vote of black people, but none have shown dedication\u2014present or past\u2014to ensuring their sustainability and longevity. This lack of dedication to HBCUs is reflected in the policy platforms of both major political parties as well as many alternative political parties, where HBCUs are mentioned as an afterthought or not mentioned at all.\n\nFor example, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign touted its plans to make the first two years of college free at public HBCUs, as well as give $25 billion to private HBCUs. Upon deeper analysis, her plan would actually be two free years of community college open to all American students, as well as $25 billion available to all 1,600 private colleges and universities in the country.\n\nThe Green Party, with its presidential nominee Jill Stein, merely states in a one-liner that it will support HBCUs, but it offers no substantive plan for how. And there\u2019s zero mention of HBCUs by the ultraconservative Republican Party and Libertarian Party, which could mean that they\u2019d prefer the eradication of these institutions, as they plan for so many government entities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo where is the national plan of action to grow and protect our HBCUs?\n\nIn the absence of a comprehensive platform to address the needs of the black community, in August a coalition of more than 60 black-led organizations, including the Black Lives Matter Network, known collectively as the Movement for Black Lives, or M4BL, released their own platform entitled, \u201cA Vision for Black Lives,\u201d which addresses numerous inequities disproportionately affecting black people, including higher education and HBCUs. The M4BL coalition writes:\n\n\n\nIn recent years we have taken to the streets, launched massive campaigns, and impacted elections, but our elected leaders have failed to address the legitimate demands of our Movement. We can no longer wait. \u2026 We recognize that not all of our collective needs and visions can be translated into policy, but we understand that policy change is one of many tactics necessary to move us towards the world we envision.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn its policy platform, which is arranged into six sections, the Movement for Black Lives demands the following:\n\n\n\nTuition- and fee-free public college\n\nStudent-loan-debt forgiveness\n\nThe preservation of HBCUs through reauthorization of the 1965 Higher Education Act, with increased and sustained funding for both public and private HBCUs\n\nA mandate for state governments to match federal funding for HBCUs\n\nThe publicly funded expansion of undergraduate and graduate degree and certification offerings at HBCUs\n\nPublic funding for HBCUs to attract and retain staff and faculty\n\nAn increase in federal and state funding to HBCUs for building maintenance and upgrades, operational budgets and research\n\n\u201cBan the box\u201d on college-admission and student-financial-aid applications\n\nThe expansion of the Second Chance Pell Grant to all individuals (juvenile and adult) currently incarcerated\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore than 30 HBCU presidents currently support the movement, and the platform has already been endorsed by myriad other organizations, including over 67 remaining members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, who are viewed as precursors to today\u2019s black millennial organizers and activists.\n\nIn a recent interview, Ash-Lee Henderson, an organizer for Project South and member of the M4BL policy table leadership team, said, \u201c[What] we know is that there\u2019s a need for transformative justice, for demands that actually aren\u2019t just Band-Aids on the big-issue problems that our communities are facing. And so, we wanted to put together a vision, a visionary platform, with transformative demands to not just reform the problem but to transform the way that black folks are able to live and thrive and support themselves in our communities.\u201d\n\nThe Movement for Black Lives has released a timely proposal with legislative and executive actions to ensure the survival and success of our remaining 100 HBCUs. And with presidential candidates, and a soon-to-be-named president, struggling to connect with black millennials, the M4BL policy team has also given them ideas to build from if they so choose.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat remains to be seen is whether our elected and appointed officials will take note and have the gumption to be allies with black people and our illustrious institutions of higher education.\n\nJ.

He garnered widespread exposure and critical praise after the release of his single \u201cRoss Capicchioni\u201d in 2015. In 2017, he released his fourth mixtape (and first on a major label), 508-507-2209. Joyner gained national attention when he appeared on the 2015 BET Hip Hop Awards Cypher. He was the first artist to be moved from the web platform of the show to the televised syndication\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUm, do you even know who Joyner Lucas is? This sounds like it was lifted directly from his Wikipedia page.\n\nBecause it was. And to answer your first question, I know who Joyner Lucas is, and I\u2019ve known exactly who Joyner Lucas is for a little over 90 minutes now.\n\nSo basically you\u2019re doing an explainer about a rapper you literally just discovered today?\n\nYes. And that\u2019s no shade to Joyner Lucas, by the way. From what I\u2019ve heard, he\u2019s a pretty talented dude. I just don\u2019t listen to much new music or the radio at all. My Spotify playlist primarily comprises Kanye, movie scores (my favs: Jesus Christ Superstar and, surprisingly, Inception), Radiohead, Ghostface and, of course, Rick Ross for when I want to scare white people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI see. So why are you writing about him today?\n\nA couple days ago, Lucas dropped \u201cI\u2019m Not Racist\u201d\u2014a now-viral video with 2.8 million views on YouTube and 24 million on Facebook. It depicts two men (one black and one white) sitting by themselves in what looks to be a warehouse, and each has the opportunity to air his racial grievances at the other.\n\nThe white man\u2014decked in a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat and \u201cregular-people\u201d clothes\u2014basically raps that black people are lazy, government-assistance-dependent criminals who use slavery as an excuse for our behavior and are more concerned with looking cool than taking care of our kids. Basically, everything we\u2019ve already heard on every message board, in every comment section and from every American politician ever.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen he\u2019s done, the black man offers his rebuttal, which is ultimately that racism is the reason we\u2019re forced to do the things the white guy accuses us of doing. Throughout each verse, \u201cI\u2019m not racist\u201d is repeated like a singular chorus breaking up each stanza. The point? Neither of these men is racist. They just need\u2014and want\u2014to understand each other better.\n\nAnd when both men are done rapping, they hug.\n\nAlso, just because I anticipate some confusion here, Joyner Lucas is black and he\u2019s actually the one rapping both the white verse and the black verse.\n\nThis sounds like a pretty cool video.\n\nIt is, actually. It was produced well, and although the lyrics veer a little corny at times, you can feel the emotion and the rage bubbling through them. It\u2019s palpable. As is the thought and care Lucas very obviously put into creating this. I don\u2019t know if this is the type of song you\u2019d listen to on the radio or in the car\u2014it feels more like a spoken-word performance than an actual song\u2014but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s intended to be.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo what are your problems with it?\n\nThe most obvious part, after watching this three times now, is that the black guy\u2019s rebuttal is weak as fuck. The white guy spits all of the Breitbart and Bannon talking points, and the black guy cites ... Tupac? Sure, he also does mention how historical structural racism makes him feel, as if he\u2019s living in a \u201cfrying pan.\u201d But his overall rebuttal is more \u201cRacism is why I do these bad things\u201d and not \u201cActually, most of us don\u2019t do those bad things you think we all do.\u201d He basically returned shrapnel fire with a spitball.\n\nAlso, it shouldn\u2019t even exist.\n\nThe entire video?\n\nYes.\n\nI thought you just said it was cool.\n\nI did. But it\u2019s cool the same way two bags of Cheetos can alleviate hunger. It\u2019s an empty coolness because the concept\u2014the song and the video\u2014is based on a faulty premise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat\u2019s that?\n\nThat white people\u2019s race-related gripes and black people\u2019s race-related gripes are equal\u2014equally justified and deserving of equal time and attention. They are not. There is no conversation that needs to happen between the races in order to create some measure of truce and racial conciliation. The only conversation that can do that is white people talking to other white people to try to find a way to be less awful to black people. (Also, saying \u201cHey, stop discriminating against and hating and killing us\u201d is not asking for a truce. Just for them to stop doing what they\u2019re doing so we can breathe.)\n\nYes, it would be great if whites and blacks came together on some kumbaya shit. But there\u2019s no meeting in the middle here. There\u2019s no finding a common ground. They have to come where we already are, and they have to recognize, acknowledge and begin to make amends for why the separation exists in the first place.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet me put it this way: How offensive and absurd would it be if, instead of a black person and a white person having this conversation, it was a Jewish person and a Nazi?\n\nUm, that analogy doesn\u2019t work. No one would dare do something like that.\n\nActually, the analogy works specifically because no one in their right mind would dare do something like that. We give the Holocaust the respect it deserves. We recognize the horror of what happened to Jewish people and the evil of the Nazis. (Well, we generally do these things.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut America doesn\u2019t give the centuries-long trans-Atlantic slave trade the same acknowledgment. The analogy doesn\u2019t seem to work because our country doesn\u2019t believe it was as serious and destructive and transformative and evil as the Holocaust was. And we still don\u2019t fully acknowledge the pervasive residue of slavery and the metaphysical construct and constraint of racism still existing today. We haven\u2019t reckoned with that evil and that violence. And because of that, the thought behind videos like \u201cI\u2019m Not Racist\u201d exists.\n\nThe message on-screen at the end of the video provides a perfect snapshot of the faultiness of this premise. It states, \u201cWe were all humans until race disconnected us, religion separated us, politics divided us, and wealth classified us.\u201d It\u2019s fulfilling and uplifting in the same bag-of-Cheetos way. But this video is dealing specifically with American race relations between black Americans and white Americans. And saying \u201cuntil race disconnected us\u201d removes the very active role white people had in creating race specifically to disconnect.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe weren\u2019t disconnected by race. We were disconnected by people who deemed themselves white. And that acknowledgment fucking matters, man. It\u2019s not some nonessential detail. It\u2019s the only one that matters.\n\nDamn. Well, anything else?\n\nI actually do appreciate what Joyner Lucas attempted to do here. And I\u2019d appreciate it even more if he read some bell hooks and Kiese Laymon and Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw and Ta-Nehisi Coates and Toni Morrison and Derrick Bell and tried again.", "keywords": ["race", "dont", "white", "problems", "hes", "joyner", "racism", "doing", "im", "lucas", "explained", "racist", "black", "way"], "polarity": -0.002419074919074912, "subjectivity": 0.4323432523432523},

If Alabama\u2019s Senate seat switches parties, that will effectively give the GOP a slim one-vote margin in the nation\u2019s highest legislative chamber. Sen. John McCain\u2019s last-minute return to the Senate to doom the American Health Care Act demonstrated how fragile the margin is because convincing two Republicans to defect from the party line is much easier than it is to convince three.\n\nFor these reasons, and the fact that\u2014with Donald Trump and Al Franken still in our nation\u2019s capital\u2014Roy Moore could push Washington, D.C.\u2019s per capita vagina-grabbing numbers over the legal limit, there are four things you should know about why it is important that Alabama selects Doug Jones over the allegedly child-molesting constitutional cowboy.\n\n1. It is all about the SCOTUS, baby: Much has been said about Roy Moore\u2019s love for tenth-graders and Doug Jones\u2019 prosecution of the 16th Street Baptist Church bombers. But this election will affect a bigger dream of Republicans across the country: the opportunity to overturn Roe v. Wade.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn April, Republicans changed the Senate rules to allow a simple majority instead of 60 votes to confirm U.S. Supreme Court nominees. This \u201cnuclear option\u201d means that the minority party can\u2019t reject a nominee unless it convinces at least three Republicans to join its dissent. It is much easier to convince two Republicans than three.\n\n\n\nMany of Alabama\u2019s Republicans claim to find Moore despicable, but they are willing to cast a vote for him because they desperately want to outlaw abortion. Now, Republican senators know that Roe v. Wade will probably never be overturned, but the ability to appoint a conservative justice could affect their stranglehold on power. The court will soon hear two cases about the legality of political gerrymandering, a ruling that will affect how party lines are drawn nationwide.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. White Jesus vs. Black Jesus: This is an existential battle of White Jesus vs. Black Jesus. Die-hard Republicans in Alabama actually believe that God wants Moore to go to Washington to save their country. Apparently, Moore is teaming up with Jesus Chadwick Christ to make the Ten Commandments law, cure homosexuality and stop the \u201cgay agenda\u201d from turning our boys transgender by rubbing up against them in bathrooms.\n\nBlack Jesus, on the other hand, simply hates when people use his name in vain. Oh ... and the whole molestation thing.\n\nBlack Jesus hates that, too.\n\n3. 2018 elections: The GOP stands to lose a few seats in next year\u2019s elections because of the dumpster fire that is the Trump administration. The only way Republicans could possibly save themselves is to pass legislation that appeals to their current base, and one less Republican senator makes that increasingly difficult.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRoy Moore is basically a hillbilly version of Donald Trump. His presence in the Senate would mean that the White House would have another advocate in the Senate to push Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant agenda, Mike Pence\u2019s religious freedom wet dreams and Jeff Sessions\u2019 history of disenfranchising voters.\n\n\n\n4. The first \u201calt-right\u201d senator: There are Roy Moore-like politicians in the House of Representatives, like Steve King (R-Iowa) and Louie Gohmert (R-Texas), but senators tend to be more moderate because they have to rally the support of their respective state. Moore would be the first senator backed by Steve Bannon, effectively giving legitimacy to the perception that the alt-right whisperer is the next kingmaker of the Republican Party.\n\nIf Moore wins, it will send a signal to Republicans that the Trump-Bannon base of their party has enough political clout to get them elected, and that could likely shift Republican ideology further right. I know that doesn\u2019t seem possible, but when you hear about bills outlawing Shariah law, speaking \u201cMexican,\u201d sex in any position other than missionary and the White Lives Matter Protection Act of 2018, just remember I told you so.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI will be updating this post throughout the evening, so check in with us for results, on-the-ground coverage and intermittent hymns begging Black Jesus, the voting gods and Beyonc\u00e9 for grace, mercy and non-pedophile-related blessings.", "keywords": ["circle", "republicans", "republican", "trump", "prayer", "race", "jesus", "white", "party", "jones", "doug", "blog", "moore", "alabama", "senate", "live", "noholdsbarred"], "polarity": 0.029985119047619056, "subjectivity": 0.4057622354497354}
