It\u2019s the Olympics\u2019 Newest Snowboard Event Image Jamie Anderson practiced for the women\u2019s big air event at the Winter X Games last month in Aspen, Colo. Credit Anna Stonehouse/The Aspen Times, via Associated Press\n\nOn the list of snowboarding events for this year\u2019s Winter Olympics, alongside the now familiar halfpipe and slopestyle, is a new competition with a short but evocative name: big air.\n\nThe name is accurate. Everything about the event is big. And the dizzying heights achieved by the snowboarders more than justifies the \u201cair.\u201d\n\nIn big air, snowboarders slide down a 49-meter tall ramp (Pyeongchang\u2019s is the biggest in the world) that curls up at the end and shoots them into the sky, seemingly forever, allowing particularly spectacular tricks.\n\nUnlike, say, slopestyle, in which athletes go down a course and have several chances to show off tricks, big air is all about the one jump, the one big, spectacular stunt.\n\nWho Are the Favorites?\n\nFor the men\u2019s favorite Mark McMorris of Canada, there\u2019s a trick that even someone new to the sport can probably guess is a doozy: the backside triple cork 1440. He does four full rotations (1440) and basically turns upside down three times (triple). And, oh yes, he has to land without falling.\n\nMark McMorris's triple cork at the 2012 Winter X Games. Credit Video by X Games\n\nSnowboarders get three jumps; their best two count.\n\nThe event has been contested at the world championships and the X Games since 2003, but is making its Olympic debut in Pyeongchang.\n\nSnowboarding has been growing at the Games. It made its debut in 1998, with two events each for men and women, and now is up to five.\n\nLike most so-called extreme sports, injuries are a big part of big air.\n\n\u201cThe crazy part about what I\u2019m doing is I get injured so much and still \u2014 every time I\u2019m laying down there, all I want is to get back on my feet, which I think a lot of people think is crazy,\u201d said the women\u2019s favorite Anna Gasser of Austria.\n\nGasser competed in slopestyle at the Winter Games in Sochi, Russia, four years ago, and fell twice, finishing 10th. \u201cI was pretty young and inexperienced,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the expectations went so high overnight. I think, as such a young athlete, I wasn\u2019t used to that. I wasn\u2019t used to having crazy media attention like everyone \u2014 I remember I should have never opened my Facebook. I had a million messages. A million friend requests. I didn\u2019t realize until that moment how big the Olympics were, and I think that made me nervous and also made me fall in the finals.\u201d\n\nA former gymnast, Gasser has completed a backside double cork 1080.\n\nAnna Gasser at the 2017 snowboard world championships.

The United States has won five of 12 medals in the men\u2019s World Cup this year.\n\nThe American women\u2019s team includes Jamie Anderson, who won a gold medal in slopestyle four years ago; Julia Marino; and 17-year-old Hailey Langland, the X Games champion, who will also be showing off a double cork 1080.\n\nSign Up for the Pyeongchang Olympics Newsletter Starting on Feb. 8, our Sports newsletter will be all things Olympics.

Scores of athletes, coaches and officials tainted by the scandal have been barred, though the International Olympic Committee has been considering allowing the Russian athletes to march under their national flag and in their country\u2019s uniforms for the closing ceremony, which they were not permitted to do during the opening ceremony. The Olympic anthem will be played instead of Russia\u2019s national anthem for any winners of gold medals, although no Russians have won so far.\n\nThe failed test is likely to figure in the thinking of the three-person I.O.C. panel charged with deciding whether Russia\u2019s team could be reinstated for the closing ceremony and its athletes allowed to parade with the Russian flag.\n\nThe panel is also closely monitoring the reaction from Russian officials to the failed test. Should they dispute the verdict or make critical comments it would be practically impossible to restore the Russian team before the end of the Games, said a person familiar with the group\u2019s thinking. Complicating matters further is Russia\u2019s continued failure to pay a $15 million fine levied by the I.O.C. as a response to the doping scheme. The fine is nonnegotiable.\n\nThe Russians allowed to participate in South Korea were subjected to what Olympics officials described as a rigorous testing regimen, and have found themselves under scrutiny from testers as the event has progressed.\n\n\u201cOn the one hand it is extremely disappointing when prohibited substances might have been used, but on the other hand it shows the effectiveness of the antidoping system at the Games, which protects the rights of all the clean athletes,\u201d the International Olympic Committee said in a statement Sunday.\n\nMeldonium caused confusion among Russian athletes when it was added to the list of banned substances by the World Anti-Doping Agency. Scores of athletes, including the five-time Grand Slam tennis champion Maria Sharapova, tested positive for it.\n\nThe antidoping agency eventually ruled that more research was required to understand how long the substance, known as mildronate in Russia, remained in the system, as some athletes claimed they had consumed it before the ban had come into force.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nExperts have said it is possible that trace amounts of the substance would still be detectable for a few months after an athlete stopped taking it, but it is unlikely it would still be present if an athlete stopped taking the drug before the ban went into effect in January 2016.\n\nEastern European scientists have promoted meldonium\u2019s health benefits, saying it increases blood flow. Increased blood flow also provides more oxygen to muscles and could increase endurance. While curling is far from cross-country skiing in terms of exertion, curlers spend hours on their feet and vigorously sweep the ice at regular intervals.\n\nMany of the athletes involved, though not Sharapova, eventually had their suspensions lifted because it was not clear when they had taken the substance.\n\nKrushelnytsky was part of the mixed doubles team that won a bronze medal last week, a rare bright spot for the depleted Russian Olympic squad, which has struggled without some of its top stars.\n\nIn the curling event, he appeared to do most of the pair\u2019s sweeping. They defeated Kristin Skaslin and Magnus Nedregotten of Norway in the bronze medal match, 8-4.\n\nThe Russian team actually had a chance to win its semifinal against Switzerland, but Krushelnytsky overshot a target on his final shot of the match, and Switzerland advanced to the final, where it was defeated by Canada.", "keywords": ["athlete", "officials", "failed", "leaves", "olympics", "russias", "athletes", "ceremony", "test", "doping", "antidoping", "newsletter", "russian", "team", "seoul", "olympic"], "polarity": 0.10170068027210885, "subjectivity": 0.429675615389901},

", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/18/sports/olympics/ligety-olympics-end.html", "text": "Ligety has vowed to race for at least one more winter, largely because this season was his first back on snow after two years spent recovering from serious knee and back surgeries. Ligety said another Olympics in four years, when he will be 37, was not \u201cout of the realm of possibilities.\u201d\n\nBut his eyes betrayed him. His wife, Mia Pascoe, and 7-month-old son, Jax, were standing not far away in the finish area. Ligety smiled and added: \u201cWhen you have a family it kind of changes your perspective. We\u2019ll see how it goes there; there are other priorities in life now besides ski racing.\u201d\n\nIf Sunday was the last Olympic appearance for Ligety, which means the last time that most Americans will see him competing, he leaves a legacy as a vital force in skiing in the United States.\n\nHe is the only American man to win two Alpine Olympic gold medals. He has won five world championships across three different events, he is a four-time Olympian, and his five World Cup season-long titles in giant slalom make him one of the greatest racers in the history of that discipline.\n\nHe introduced giant slalom techniques that were considered revolutionary, tactics his rivals toiled for years to replicate. Outspoken and at times a provocateur, for a dozen years he was a magnetic personality on the World Cup circuit and one of the few American stars who bridged the gap from the Bode Miller era to the budding Mikaela Shiffrin era.\n\nLigety also worked hard to drag ski racing out of tedious, old-style ways. He co-founded a helmet, eyewear and snow sports accessories company called Shred that was aimed at, as he said, \u201cbringing a youthful vibe back to skiing \u2014 something the snowboarding movement stole from us.\u201d\n\nLigety was also at the center of a quarrel with the European-based ski establishment, a battle he ultimately won and probably lost at the same time.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLigety had been the leading World Cup giant slalom racer for several years when F.I.S., as the ski racing\u2019s international governing body is known by its French initials, decided to lengthen the minimum ski length racers were permitted to use in the giant slalom.\n\nThe longer skis meant that turning around the gates would take more time and effort and Ligety immediately railed against the changes in an insightful blog post that was also a stinging poke in the eye for the federation\u2019s leaders.\n\nLigety, always one to tinker with his equipment, then decided to study his new skis with the meticulous eye of the engineer he never became. To further his examination, he also came up with gadgets that were meant to give him more data, like a curved post he affixed to his helmet on which he placed a mini-camera so he could better analyze his own skiing.\n\nIn time, Ligety devised new techniques to make longer skis turn more quickly, which was the opposite of their intended effect. He stunned the field in the first race with the new skis, winning by nearly three seconds over the second-place finisher, an almost unheard-of margin of victory.\n\nThroughout the next two seasons, Ligety continued to dominate giant slalom on the World Cup. He also won the giant slalom at the 2014 Sochi Olympics.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story 2018 Olympics Newsletter For 19 days, our Sports newsletter will be all things Olympics.

In early 2016, Ligety tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee in a training session. Almost exactly one year later, he had back surgery meant to alleviate severe pain he had been dealing with for many months.\n\nBefore this season, the federation reduced the minimum lengths for giant slalom skis.\n\nLigety, however, who has shown flashes of his old self, has yet to regain his form in a consistent manner.

That put him in the top 16, he thought. Also, Dutton had finished second in the 500 meters at the Canadian nationals. His best time in the 500 meters didn\u2019t meet the qualifying standard, but that number was determined in part by the times of those two Russian skaters who appeared likely to be barred. Eliminate them, and he met the standard.\n\nHowever, the I.O.C. took more than a month to decide the exact criteria for barring the Russians. The I.O.C. president, Thomas Bach, has said the time was necessary to provide the Russians with due process and figure out a complicated procedure for approval.\n\nWith time short to select its Olympic team, Speed Skating Canada decided to pick the three Canadians ranked ahead of Dutton, even though Dutton had skated to second place in the trials and would have made the top 16 if the Russians didn\u2019t figure in calculations.\n\nDutton took the speedskating selectors to court. The matter was referred to arbitration. That created uncertainty and tension within the team as Dutton\u2019s potential inclusion would have imperiled the participation of another athlete, Laurent Dubreuil.\n\nDavid Bennett, an arbiter with the Sport Dispute Resolution Center of Canada, ruled that Canada\u2019s Olympic selection panel should reconsider its decision because Dutton \u201cwould meet the criteria if the ineligible Russian athletes were not included.\u201d\n\nBennett asked the panel to consider the results of the two most detailed investigations into the Russian affair: A 2016 report by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren that first laid out the scale of the cheating scheme, and a similar study on behalf of the I.O.C. by Samuel Schmid, a former president of Switzerland, that confirmed many of those findings late last year. Bennett also argued that the two Russians placed above Dutton, Pavel Kulizhnikov and Artyom Kuznetsov, would most likely be ruled ineligible from the Games when the I.O.C. issued its decision.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStill, when the selection panel met to review its decision on Jan. 23, the I.O.C. had not publicly disclosed how it would determine which Russian athletes would be picked. Several barred athletes, including Kuznetsov, were appealing to the international Court of Arbitration for Sport. According to documents reviewed by The New York Times, this lack of clarity played a role in the panel\u2019s decision to stick with its original selections and not assume the Russian skaters would be eliminated, which they eventually were.\n\nSelectors \u201ccould not determine that Russian athletes should be removed from the determination of the Qualifying Standard,\u201d said one of the documents. The selectors also felt Russian athletes should receive the same \u201cdue process, natural justice and procedural fairness\u201d as Dutton while their appeals had yet to be ruled on.\n\nSusan Auch, Speed Skating Canada\u2019s interim chief executive, is adamant that the selection body made the right decision, saying that Dutton was simply a victim of fierce competition. She conceded, however, that the delay in dealing with Russia created a \u201cmurky situation\u201d for all sports governing bodies.\n\n\u201cWe had to make a decision with the information we had at the moment,\u201d she said.\n\nDutton described the six-hour arbitration hearing as worse than anything he\u2019d experienced in nearly 10 years of speedskating. \u201cI think my heartbeat went to 190,\u201d he said. \u201cFour years of training come down to that.\u201d\n\nThe irony of a Canadian being ensnared by the Russian scandal isn\u2019t lost on Dutton. The process that led to Russia\u2019s ouster is inextricably linked to Canada.\n\nMcLaren\u2019s investigation exposed the scale of the scheme, and since then, some of the biggest voices demanding tough action against Russia have come from Canada. Richard W. Pound, a Canadian who once led the World Anti-Doping Agency and is the I.O.C.\u2019s longest-serving member, has urged the organization to take the hardest of lines against Russia.\n\nThe former Canadian cross-country skier Beckie Scott, the leader of the agency\u2019s athlete committee, has also been a prominent voice.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a Canadian-led fight, really,\u201d Dutton said.\n\nPound said that Dutton should be at the Games and not sitting more than 5,000 miles away from his teammates.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story 2018 Olympics Newsletter For 19 days, our Sports newsletter will be all things Olympics.

The bold move paid off, helping him leap from 17th place to fifth.\n\nFirst rotation Second Third Double Toe Takeoff Fourth Quad Flip Backward takeoff First rotation Second Third Double Toe Takeoff Fourth Quad Flip Backward takeoff 1st rotation 2nd Double Toe 3rd 4th Quad Flip Chen\u2019s quadruple flip-double toe combination jump during his long program on Saturday. Composite image by Jeremy White/The New York Times\n\nChen\u2019s unprecedented six quads at the Olympics included the quadruple flip-double toe combination shown above. The move gave him 215.08 points, enough to win the long program portion of the competition. But his poor showing in the short program kept him off the podium.\n\nChen, 18, who had been an American hope for a gold, had initially planned to perform five quads, but it was \u201calmost a game-time decision\u201d to add a sixth, he said.\n\n\u201cI knew at that point that I had literally nothing to lose, so I decided just to try it,\u201d Chen said.\n\nBecause quad jumps have the highest base values in figure skating, there is a powerful incentive for skaters to try quads in competition even if they are not consistently landing the jumps. Sixteen of the 24 skaters on Saturday attempted at least one quad.\n\nQuadruple Jumps Attempted in the Long Program Note: Judges score each element on a scale from \u20133 to +3. We\u2019re counting successful attempts as quad jumps by themselves or in combinations for which the average of the judges\u2019 grades of execution is greater than \u20132. We are throwing out the scores of the highest and lowest judges, just as it is done in the official scoring system. Skaters who did not attempt quads are not shown.\n\nChen performed two more quads than Yuzuru Hanyu of Japan, who defended his Olympic title, winning his second straight gold medal in the event on Saturday. Those extra quads helped Chen earn his best score this season, nearly 9 more points than Hanyu\u2019s 206.17 in the long program.\n\nThird Second First rotation Fourth Quad Toe Backward takeoff Triple Toe Second Third First rotation Fourth Quad Toe Backward takeoff Triple Toe 2nd 3rd 1st rotation 4th Quad Toe Triple Toe This quad toe-triple toe jump combination was the highest scoring element of Chen\u2019s program. Composite image by Bedel Saget and Archie Tse/The New York Times\n\nTo maximize points, Chen saved three of his quads, including the quadruple toe combination shown above, for the second half of his program.\n\nAny jump done after the halfway point gets a 10 percent bonus, which is a reward to skaters for executing difficult elements when they are tired. Skaters also gain or lose additional points depending on how well a quad is executed.\n\nSecond Third First rotation Fourth Takeoff Both hands touch ice Second Third First rotation Fourth Take off Both hands touch ice 2nd 3rd 1st rotation 4th Take off Both hands touch ice Only one of Chen\u2019s quad attempts was not landed cleanly: this quad flip, which was the third element of his program. Composite image by Bedel Saget and Jeremy White/The New York Times\n\nChen lost points on a quadruple flip shown above, after he put his hands down on the ice during the landing.\n\nBut he still earned 10.07 points for that move, which is nearly 3 points more than the maximum value he would have received for a well-executed triple jump.\n\nWhile Chen won the long program, Hanyu, 23, got higher marks for artistry. In addition to points for technical elements like quads, skaters also receive marks for the quality of their skating, called the \u201cprogram components\u201d score. It is measured in categories like skating skills, choreography and musical interpretation.\n\nThis is where Hanyu stands apart. The Japanese skater, who is recovering from an ankle injury, scored 9 points higher than Chen on his component score, showing off nearly an entire quad\u2019s worth of hidden advantage.\n\nAn artistic sequence near the end of the long program of Yuzuru Hanyu, who won the gold medal for Japan on Saturday, as he had in Sochi in 2014.

He\u2019s everything. He\u2019s the skater, he\u2019s the jumper, but quintessentially, he\u2019s the performer. He seems to have the superpower to take all the pressure, all the expectations and all the lights and all the cameras, and somehow he\u2019s able to use it as a competitor.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s how the free skate played out:\n\nGermany\u2019s Paul Fentz Does Game of Thrones Cosplay\n\nPaul Fentz of Germany had a heavily themed Game of Thrones routine. He skated to the dramatic music from the television show\u2019s soundtrack, and was dressed in a shirt designed to look like armor. He wore one gold glove, perhaps reminding some viewers of Jaime Lannister, who has a metal hand. But the judges did not seem to agree that Winter is coming, and put him in third place of the three skaters who have gone.\n\nJapan\u2019s Keiji Tanaka Leads Early; Nathan Chen Up Next\n\nWith the six lesser lights of the 24 competitors having skated, Keiji Tanaka of Japan is the early leader, helped by a quad Salchow at the top of his program. The second group of six will include Nathan Chen of the United States, who disappointed badly in his short program, but has a daring five-quad program to try to make up ground.\n\nPhoto\n\nTwo Quads Gives Bychenko the Lead\n\nAlexei Bychenko of Israel, the first skater of the second group, gave a strong performance that moved him into the lead. Bychenko, skating to music from the opera Pagliacci, hit both his quads and fell to his knees with joy at the end of the performance.\n\nPhoto\n\nNathan Chen Gets Aggressive, Goes for Six Quads\n\nNathan Chen, who bombed his short program and stood in only 17th place, hoped to make up ground with a daring five quad performance. But he did not land five quads. He threw in one more and landed six.\n\nChen, 18, performed a quad Lutz, flip combination, flip, toe loop combination, toe loop and Salchow. The quad toe loop-triple toe loop combo scored a huge 17.63 points by itself. Chen also did well on the more subjective judging elements, getting over 9 for performance. He takes a big lead over the other early skaters, by a full 40 points.\n\nIt was a redemptive and audaciously ambitious performance. Chen became the first Olympian to land five quadruple jumps cleanly in a routine and actually attempted six, but put his hands to the ice on the quad flip. His score of 297.35 could put him in medal contention if the leaders struggle later.\n\nBrendan Kerry Invokes Pink Floyd\n\nBrendan Kerry of Australia has had some of the more intriguing musical choices of the event. In the short program he skated to an eerie cover of \u201cEverybody Wants to Rule the World.\u201d For the free skate he chose a Pink Floyd medley, including \u201cShine on You Crazy Diamond\u201d and \u201cMoney.\u201d But his performance wasn\u2019t quite up to snuff and he bailed out of his quads. That concluded the second group of six skaters. Twelve to go. Chen still leads by 40 points.\n\nPhoto\n\nKeegan Messing Puts on a Show\n\nThe Olympics are at their heart, a sports competition, but no one has had more fun here than Keegan Messing of Canada, who entertained the crowd with a Charlie Chaplin routine on Saturday after skating to Singin\u2019 in the Rain on Friday.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe is unapologetic about being a showman as much as a competitor. \u201cI just feel like I can bring the crowd in; it makes my skating so much more fun for me,\u201d he said. Messing also hit two quads and moved into third place.\n\nNathan Chen Made a \u201cGame-Time Decision\u201d to Try 6 Quads\n\nLeader Nathan Chen spoke after his amazing program:\n\n\u201cHaving such a rough short program allowed me to just forget about expectations and just allow myself to really enjoy myself,\u201d Chen said. \u201cI think six quads was almost a game-time decision, I knew at that point that I had literally nothing to lose.\n\n\u201cAs much as I tried to deny it, I felt the pressure a lot before the short program, especially thinking about scores and placement and all that. And that was completely out of my control. That just tightened me up and made me really cautious on the ice.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nVincent Zhou Nearly Matches Nathan Chen\n\nVincent Zhou, 17, exceeded expectations in his short program, placing 12th. And he rolled out an ambitious five-quad free skate. And like his countryman Nathan Chen, he delivered.\n\nIn skating\u2019s complicated scoring system, Zhou was credited with four quadruple jumps, three of them landed cleanly. He put his hand to the ice on a quad flip. And his attempt to become the first Olympic skater to land two quad Lutzes \u2014 the most difficult of the four-revolution jumps being performed \u2014 came up short. His second Lutz was judged to have been under-rotated. Still, his score for the long program was a lifetime best of 192.16 points.\n\nHis technical score was only 7 off Chen\u2019s and he moved into second place overall, 21 points down. Zhou is definitely one to watch for 2022.\n\nPhoto\n\nAdam Rippon Skates a Clean Program, but No Quads\n\nAdam Rippon, the man with the killer abs, was the final American to skate. A program without quads would make it difficult to finish high, but he wheeled out all his showmanship, including birdlike motions while skating to Coldplay\u2019s \u201cArrival of the Birds.\u201d And he landed all those triples.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRippon skated with his accustomed elegance, but the jumping prowess of Nathan Chen and Vincent Zhou illustrated the gulf between his artistry and the bold athleticism needed to score highly under today\u2019s scoring system.\n\nWith six more to skate, the American men can finish no lower than 7th, 8th and 10th. This is the fourth time in the last five Olympics that all three men have made the top 10. The last time was 2010, when Evan Lysacek won the gold medal, Johnny Weir finished sixth and Jeremy Abbott took ninth.\n\nDmitri Aliev Struggles\n\nDmitri Aliev, the 18-year-old Russian, was the first of the final six to skate and probably the least likely winner, with only two quads in his program. He wound up falling as well and can only place third, though that\u2019s not likely.\n\nJin Boyang Passes Nathan Chen for First Place\n\nJin Boyang of China was fourth after the short program and planned a four-quad program set to \u201cThe Planets\u201d and the Cantina Theme and other music from \u201cStar Wars.\u201d Jin delivered an almost clean routine, marred by one fall. His free skate score was lower than Nathan Chen\u2019s, but Jin had a 21-point lead over Chen after the short program. It adds up to a new leader by less than a point. Chen is back in second.\n\nPatrick Chan Can\u2019t Make Up Ground\n\nPatrick Chan of Canada was sixth after the short program. His routine, set to Jeff Buckley\u2019s version of \u201cHallelujah,\u201d had two quads, both right at the top. He landed the first and stepped out of the second one slightly. He also put a hand down on a later jump and had an unprovoked stumble. An always dignified skater, the 27-year-old Chan stood only in sixth. Next up, the leader and gold medal favorite, Yuzuru Hanyu.\n\nPhoto\n\nYuzuru Hanyu Leads After Strong Routine\n\nYuzuru Hanyu of Japan, the world\u2019s most famous Winnie the Pooh enthusiast, had the gold medal for the taking, with the lead and a four-quad performance planned. He nailed the first three, but stumbled on the fourth, a planned quad-single-triple combination. It might have been enough for the gold, but Hanyu threw in one more unplanned quad for good measure. One more small stumble came on a triple, but Hanyu laid down a strong performance that will make him hard to catch. Winnie the Pooh dolls rained down from the audience in the aftermath.\n\nHanyu took over first place. His free skate score was 6 points lower than Chen\u2019s but combined with the short program he claimed a 20-point lead.\n\nPhoto\n\nJavier Fernandez in 2nd Place After Strong Routine\n\nJavier Fernandez of Spain was fourth four years ago, but he put himself in position to get a medal this time. After a strong second in the short program, he delivered in his free skate to Man of La Mancha, completing two of his three planned quads. The last skater will be Shoma Uno of Japan, with the current medal positions Hanyu-Fernandez-Jin. The American Nathan Chen has slipped to fourth place.\n\nShoma Uno Passes Fernandez for Silver\n\nIt all came down to Shoma Uno, who could get a medal and maybe even the gold if he nailed his four-quad program set to Turandot. But he fell on Quad No. 1 and stepped out of a combo. It was good enough for second place, and Yuzuru Hanyu repeated as the men\u2019s Olympic champion.

But major mistakes in his short program the day before kept him off the podium. He ended in fifth place.\n\nWe tracked the number of quadruple jumps attempted by each skater:\n\nQuadruple Jumps Attempted in Free Skate Note: Judges score each element on a scale from \u20133 to +3. We\u2019re counting successful attempts as quad jumps by themselves or in combinations for which the average of the judges\u2019 grades of execution is greater than \u20132. We are throwing out the scores of the highest and lowest judges, just as it is done in the official scoring system. Skaters who did not attempt quads are not shown.\n\nA quad, which is a jump that has four revolutions, has the highest base value in figure skating and is generally worth more than twice the equivalent triple jump. For example, a triple lutz has a base value of 6 points. A quad lutz is worth 13.6 points.\n\nThis creates a powerful incentive for skaters to try a quad in competition even if they are not consistently landing the jump.\n\nSkaters also gain or lose additional points depending on how well the quad is executed. And any jump done in the second half of a program, when skaters\u2019 legs are tired, gets a 10 percent bonus.\n\nFor example, below are the 13 elements of the long program of Yuzuru Hanyu of Japan, performed at the 2017 world championships, in the order that he executed them. Three elements were quad jumps by themselves, and one more was a quad in combination with another jump.\n\nQuad combo Triple combo Quad Quad Triple Quad Triple Spin Step sequence Spin Step sequence Spin Quad combo Triple combo Quad Quad Triple Quad Triple Spin Step sequence Spin Step sequence Spin Quad combo Triple combo Quad Quad Triple Quad Triple Spin Step sequence Spin Step sequence Spin Quad combo Triple combo Quad Quad Triple Quad Triple Spin Step sequence Spin Step sequence Spin Source: International Skating Union\n\nHe waited to do his last two quads until he had passed the halfway point of his program.\n\nNathan Chen of the United States and Shoma Uno of Japan have most consistently attempted five quads in recent competitions.

Spain\u2019s Javier Fernandez has tried as many as three.\n\nNumber of quads in each skater\u2019s 10 most recent major competitions\n\nHanyu, Fernandez, Uno and Jin are the leaders going into Saturday\u2019s long program competition.\n\nChen, who was America\u2019s hope for a gold medal in the men\u2019s individual event, made major errors in his short program, practically taking him out of contention.\n\nMathematically, packing in as many quads as possible may seem like the only route to the podium for any of the skaters.\n\nThat may be, unless we\u2019re talking about Hanyu, the gold medalist in Sochi four years ago, who was the winner of the short program here.\n\nWhile skaters earn points for the elements, like quads, of a program, they also receive a score for the quality of their skating, called the \u201cprogram components\u201d score. It is measured in categories like skating skills, choreography and musical interpretation.\n\nThis is where Hanyu stands apart. He is often points ahead of his competition in artistry and gets higher marks for how well he executes his technical elements as well.\n\nYuzuru Hanyu performing in Friday\u2019s short program event.

In any case, the South Korean women\u2019s team is a medal contender and proved as much by upsetting Canada in its opening match of the tournament.\n\nIt was a bittersweet, if mostly bitter, result for Canadian fans: Peter Gallant, South Korea\u2019s coach, is from Prince Edward Island.\n\nIs Canada still the team to beat in men\u2019s hockey even without current N.H.L. players on its team?\n\nPhoto\n\nThe men\u2019s hockey draw seems like a total tossup. Traditional powerhouses like the United States and Russia \u2014 or the team that used to be known as Russia \u2014 lost their opening matches. Canada defeated Switzerland in its first match of the tournament in front of a mostly empty house at Gangneung Ice Arena.\n\nWithout the star power that N.H.L. players delivered at previous Olympics, the tournament is struggling to attract many eyeballs. Teams have filled their rosters with players who are toiling away in lesser leagues or are at the end of their career \u2014 and that includes Canada, which went with older players while leaving younger prospects at home.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe result is that chemistry will need to be built on the fly, and nobody seems too sure how this tournament will pan out.

(Don\u2019t bother checking my past results.) My travel schedule and the on-and-off winter in Ottawa mean that I\u2019m just skiing occasionally with my wife this year. I\u2019m also the household\u2019s wax technician. But the grumbling I hear when I get the wax wrong is nothing compared with what Knut Nystad experiences. David Segal reported that Mr. Nystad, the chief of Norway\u2019s 30-strong crew of Olympic wax techs, becomes public enemy No. 1 back home when his team messes up.\n\nCross-country skiing is to Norway what hockey is to Canada. Mr. Segal looked into Norway\u2019s equivalent of Sept. 28, 1972. (For non-Canadian readers: that\u2019s the day that Paul Henderson scored the winning goal against the Russians in the Summit series.)

Adam hangs face down in the chair with the cushion supporting him on the hips. For this exercise, Adam uses a 25-pound medicine ball, but you can use a lighter weight, even a five-pound ball or no ball at all. It is best to have someone with you, but you can modify the exercise so you can do it alone.\n\nStart in the bent-over position on the chair with the ball on the floor a little to the left. Put both hands on the ball. Lift and rotate your body so you can throw the ball to your right. Basically, Adam reaches for the ball on his left and twists to whip the ball to the right. For Adam, this is functional because he\u2019s jumping and rotating on the ice. This should burn, but if it\u2019s really hurting, then stop. Start off slow without a weighted ball and just go through the twist and the motion. Then add the weighted ball. If you don\u2019t have a partner, just lift the ball up and twist but don\u2019t throw. Make sure you only do one side 10 times and then do the other side. If you go back and forth you can wrench your back. (Four sets of 20; 10 on the right, 10 on the left.)\n\nElevated Running Man: Adam hangs from straps in a metal cage, and wears a resistance band around each ankle that is also connected to the nearest cage post. He drives his left knee up toward his right elbow, crossing his body to create resistance. It makes the abs really strong, and it\u2019s connecting the lower part of the body up through the abs to the upper body. It mimics the movement they do on the ice when you see them jump and cross their legs. If we end the workout with this, we\u2019ll do sets of 20. But if it\u2019s early in the abs workout, we\u2019ll do 40. (Four sets of 20; alternating right and left side.)\n\nPhoto\n\nTwisting Pike: Adam hangs from the straps again and he holds a smaller, 35-millimeter Swiss therapy ball between his ankles. Next he lifts his legs to a pike position, so his legs are parallel to the floor. He twists to the right as far as he can, and then to the left. He twists right, left, right, left \u2014 it\u2019s not easy. It\u2019s mimicking what the ab does internally when he\u2019s jumping and rotating. It isolates the abdominal area, but we want to balance between the abdominal area and the rest of the body, so that\u2019s why he does these more connecting movements. You don\u2019t want to overdevelop one part. Everything is symmetrical and balanced. (Four sets of 20; alternating right and left side.)\n\nRecovery Meal: After the workout, I require Adam to eat within 30 minutes. He eats protein \u2014 chicken, fish or beef and maybe a salad. You need your carbs, but nobody needs bread, pasta or rice. He gets his carbs from fruits and vegetables, like yams.\n\nChange It Up: Every workout, we change the order and maybe add something different. The body gets bored, so we like to mix up the order every time.\n\nSave Abs for the End: Because the abdominal muscles work together with the muscles in the back to protect the spine, you don\u2019t want to tire them out at the beginning of a workout. We always save the ab work for the end of the training day. We\u2019ll spend 25 minutes on abs, but it\u2019s always the last thing, our big finale.", "keywords": ["left", "abs", "dont", "secret", "workout", "adam", "sets", "right", "ball", "body", "20", "olympic", "rippons"], "polarity": 0.07950439040864571, "subjectivity": 0.33916751097602166},

Scores of athletes, coaches and officials tainted by the scandal have been barred, though the International Olympic Committee has been considering allowing the Russian athletes to march under their national flag and in their country\u2019s uniforms for the closing ceremony, which they were not permitted to do during the opening ceremony. The Olympic anthem will be played instead of Russia\u2019s national anthem for any winners of gold medals, although no Russians have won so far.\n\nThe failed test is likely to figure in the thinking of the three-person I.O.C. panel charged with deciding whether Russia\u2019s team could be reinstated for the closing ceremony and its athletes allowed to parade with the Russian flag.\n\nThe panel is also closely monitoring the reaction from Russian officials to the failed test. Should they dispute the verdict or make critical comments it would be practically impossible to restore the Russian team before the end of the Games, said a person familiar with the group\u2019s thinking. Complicating matters further is Russia\u2019s continued failure to pay a $15 million fine levied by the I.O.C. as a response to the doping scheme. The fine is nonnegotiable.\n\nThe Russians allowed to participate in South Korea were subjected to what Olympics officials described as a rigorous testing regimen, and have found themselves under scrutiny from testers as the event has progressed.\n\n\u201cOn the one hand it is extremely disappointing when prohibited substances might have been used, but on the other hand it shows the effectiveness of the antidoping system at the Games, which protects the rights of all the clean athletes,\u201d the International Olympic Committee said in a statement Sunday.\n\nMeldonium caused confusion among Russian athletes when it was added to the list of banned substances by the World Anti-Doping Agency. Scores of athletes, including the five-time Grand Slam tennis champion Maria Sharapova, tested positive for it.\n\nThe antidoping agency eventually ruled that more research was required to understand how long the substance, known as mildronate in Russia, remained in the system, as some athletes claimed they had consumed it before the ban had come into force.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nExperts have said it is possible that trace amounts of the substance would still be detectable for a few months after an athlete stopped taking it, but it is unlikely it would still be present if an athlete stopped taking the drug before the ban went into effect in January 2016.\n\nEastern European scientists have promoted meldonium\u2019s health benefits, saying it increases blood flow. Increased blood flow also provides more oxygen to muscles and could increase endurance. While curling is far from cross-country skiing in terms of exertion, curlers spend hours on their feet and vigorously sweep the ice at regular intervals.\n\nMany of the athletes involved, though not Sharapova, eventually had their suspensions lifted because it was not clear when they had taken the substance.\n\nKrushelnytsky was part of the mixed doubles team that won a bronze medal last week, a rare bright spot for the depleted Russian Olympic squad, which has struggled without some of its top stars.\n\nIn the curling event, he appeared to do most of the pair\u2019s sweeping. They defeated Kristin Skaslin and Magnus Nedregotten of Norway in the bronze medal match, 8-4.\n\nThe Russian team actually had a chance to win its semifinal against Switzerland, but Krushelnytsky overshot a target on his final shot of the match, and Switzerland advanced to the final, where it was defeated by Canada.", "keywords": ["athlete", "officials", "failed", "leaves", "olympics", "russias", "athletes", "ceremony", "test", "doping", "antidoping", "newsletter", "russian", "team", "seoul", "olympic"], "polarity": 0.10170068027210885, "subjectivity": 0.429675615389901},

Ligety said another Olympics in four years, when he will be 37, was not \u201cout of the realm of possibilities.\u201d\n\nBut his eyes betrayed him. His wife, Mia Pascoe, and 7-month-old son, Jax, were standing not far away in the finish area. Ligety smiled and added: \u201cWhen you have a family it kind of changes your perspective. We\u2019ll see how it goes there; there are other priorities in life now besides ski racing.\u201d\n\nIf Sunday was the last Olympic appearance for Ligety, which means the last time that most Americans will see him competing, he leaves a legacy as a vital force in skiing in the United States.\n\nHe is the only American man to win two Alpine Olympic gold medals. He has won five world championships across three different events, he is a four-time Olympian, and his five World Cup season-long titles in giant slalom make him one of the greatest racers in the history of that discipline.\n\nHe introduced giant slalom techniques that were considered revolutionary, tactics his rivals toiled for years to replicate. Outspoken and at times a provocateur, for a dozen years he was a magnetic personality on the World Cup circuit and one of the few American stars who bridged the gap from the Bode Miller era to the budding Mikaela Shiffrin era.\n\nLigety also worked hard to drag ski racing out of tedious, old-style ways. He co-founded a helmet, eyewear and snow sports accessories company called Shred that was aimed at, as he said, \u201cbringing a youthful vibe back to skiing \u2014 something the snowboarding movement stole from us.\u201d\n\nLigety was also at the center of a quarrel with the European-based ski establishment, a battle he ultimately won and probably lost at the same time.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLigety had been the leading World Cup giant slalom racer for several years when F.I.S., as the ski racing\u2019s international governing body is known by its French initials, decided to lengthen the minimum ski length racers were permitted to use in the giant slalom.\n\nThe longer skis meant that turning around the gates would take more time and effort and Ligety immediately railed against the changes in an insightful blog post that was also a stinging poke in the eye for the federation\u2019s leaders.\n\nLigety, always one to tinker with his equipment, then decided to study his new skis with the meticulous eye of the engineer he never became. To further his examination, he also came up with gadgets that were meant to give him more data, like a curved post he affixed to his helmet on which he placed a mini-camera so he could better analyze his own skiing.\n\nIn time, Ligety devised new techniques to make longer skis turn more quickly, which was the opposite of their intended effect. He stunned the field in the first race with the new skis, winning by nearly three seconds over the second-place finisher, an almost unheard-of margin of victory.\n\nThroughout the next two seasons, Ligety continued to dominate giant slalom on the World Cup. He also won the giant slalom at the 2014 Sochi Olympics.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story 2018 Olympics Newsletter For 19 days, our Sports newsletter will be all things Olympics.

In early 2016, Ligety tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee in a training session. Almost exactly one year later, he had back surgery meant to alleviate severe pain he had been dealing with for many months.\n\nBefore this season, the federation reduced the minimum lengths for giant slalom skis.\n\nLigety, however, who has shown flashes of his old self, has yet to regain his form in a consistent manner.

That put him in the top 16, he thought. Also, Dutton had finished second in the 500 meters at the Canadian nationals. His best time in the 500 meters didn\u2019t meet the qualifying standard, but that number was determined in part by the times of those two Russian skaters who appeared likely to be barred. Eliminate them, and he met the standard.\n\nHowever, the I.O.C. took more than a month to decide the exact criteria for barring the Russians. The I.O.C. president, Thomas Bach, has said the time was necessary to provide the Russians with due process and figure out a complicated procedure for approval.\n\nWith time short to select its Olympic team, Speed Skating Canada decided to pick the three Canadians ranked ahead of Dutton, even though Dutton had skated to second place in the trials and would have made the top 16 if the Russians didn\u2019t figure in calculations.\n\nDutton took the speedskating selectors to court. The matter was referred to arbitration. That created uncertainty and tension within the team as Dutton\u2019s potential inclusion would have imperiled the participation of another athlete, Laurent Dubreuil.\n\nDavid Bennett, an arbiter with the Sport Dispute Resolution Center of Canada, ruled that Canada\u2019s Olympic selection panel should reconsider its decision because Dutton \u201cwould meet the criteria if the ineligible Russian athletes were not included.\u201d\n\nBennett asked the panel to consider the results of the two most detailed investigations into the Russian affair: A 2016 report by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren that first laid out the scale of the cheating scheme, and a similar study on behalf of the I.O.C. by Samuel Schmid, a former president of Switzerland, that confirmed many of those findings late last year. Bennett also argued that the two Russians placed above Dutton, Pavel Kulizhnikov and Artyom Kuznetsov, would most likely be ruled ineligible from the Games when the I.O.C. issued its decision.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStill, when the selection panel met to review its decision on Jan. 23, the I.O.C. had not publicly disclosed how it would determine which Russian athletes would be picked. Several barred athletes, including Kuznetsov, were appealing to the international Court of Arbitration for Sport. According to documents reviewed by The New York Times, this lack of clarity played a role in the panel\u2019s decision to stick with its original selections and not assume the Russian skaters would be eliminated, which they eventually were.\n\nSelectors \u201ccould not determine that Russian athletes should be removed from the determination of the Qualifying Standard,\u201d said one of the documents. The selectors also felt Russian athletes should receive the same \u201cdue process, natural justice and procedural fairness\u201d as Dutton while their appeals had yet to be ruled on.\n\nSusan Auch, Speed Skating Canada\u2019s interim chief executive, is adamant that the selection body made the right decision, saying that Dutton was simply a victim of fierce competition. She conceded, however, that the delay in dealing with Russia created a \u201cmurky situation\u201d for all sports governing bodies.\n\n\u201cWe had to make a decision with the information we had at the moment,\u201d she said.\n\nDutton described the six-hour arbitration hearing as worse than anything he\u2019d experienced in nearly 10 years of speedskating. \u201cI think my heartbeat went to 190,\u201d he said. \u201cFour years of training come down to that.\u201d\n\nThe irony of a Canadian being ensnared by the Russian scandal isn\u2019t lost on Dutton. The process that led to Russia\u2019s ouster is inextricably linked to Canada.\n\nMcLaren\u2019s investigation exposed the scale of the scheme, and since then, some of the biggest voices demanding tough action against Russia have come from Canada. Richard W. Pound, a Canadian who once led the World Anti-Doping Agency and is the I.O.C.\u2019s longest-serving member, has urged the organization to take the hardest of lines against Russia.\n\nThe former Canadian cross-country skier Beckie Scott, the leader of the agency\u2019s athlete committee, has also been a prominent voice.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a Canadian-led fight, really,\u201d Dutton said.\n\nPound said that Dutton should be at the Games and not sitting more than 5,000 miles away from his teammates.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story 2018 Olympics Newsletter For 19 days, our Sports newsletter will be all things Olympics.

The bold move paid off, helping him leap from 17th place to fifth.\n\nFirst rotation Second Third Double Toe Takeoff Fourth Quad Flip Backward takeoff First rotation Second Third Double Toe Takeoff Fourth Quad Flip Backward takeoff 1st rotation 2nd Double Toe 3rd 4th Quad Flip Chen\u2019s quadruple flip-double toe combination jump during his long program on Saturday. Composite image by Jeremy White/The New York Times\n\nChen\u2019s unprecedented six quads at the Olympics included the quadruple flip-double toe combination shown above. The move gave him 215.08 points, enough to win the long program portion of the competition. But his poor showing in the short program kept him off the podium.\n\nChen, 18, who had been an American hope for a gold, had initially planned to perform five quads, but it was \u201calmost a game-time decision\u201d to add a sixth, he said.\n\n\u201cI knew at that point that I had literally nothing to lose, so I decided just to try it,\u201d Chen said.\n\nBecause quad jumps have the highest base values in figure skating, there is a powerful incentive for skaters to try quads in competition even if they are not consistently landing the jumps. Sixteen of the 24 skaters on Saturday attempted at least one quad.\n\nQuadruple Jumps Attempted in the Long Program Note: Judges score each element on a scale from \u20133 to +3. We\u2019re counting successful attempts as quad jumps by themselves or in combinations for which the average of the judges\u2019 grades of execution is greater than \u20132. We are throwing out the scores of the highest and lowest judges, just as it is done in the official scoring system. Skaters who did not attempt quads are not shown.\n\nChen performed two more quads than Yuzuru Hanyu of Japan, who defended his Olympic title, winning his second straight gold medal in the event on Saturday. Those extra quads helped Chen earn his best score this season, nearly 9 more points than Hanyu\u2019s 206.17 in the long program.\n\nThird Second First rotation Fourth Quad Toe Backward takeoff Triple Toe Second Third First rotation Fourth Quad Toe Backward takeoff Triple Toe 2nd 3rd 1st rotation 4th Quad Toe Triple Toe This quad toe-triple toe jump combination was the highest scoring element of Chen\u2019s program. Composite image by Bedel Saget and Archie Tse/The New York Times\n\nTo maximize points, Chen saved three of his quads, including the quadruple toe combination shown above, for the second half of his program.\n\nAny jump done after the halfway point gets a 10 percent bonus, which is a reward to skaters for executing difficult elements when they are tired. Skaters also gain or lose additional points depending on how well a quad is executed.\n\nSecond Third First rotation Fourth Takeoff Both hands touch ice Second Third First rotation Fourth Take off Both hands touch ice 2nd 3rd 1st rotation 4th Take off Both hands touch ice Only one of Chen\u2019s quad attempts was not landed cleanly: this quad flip, which was the third element of his program. Composite image by Bedel Saget and Jeremy White/The New York Times\n\nChen lost points on a quadruple flip shown above, after he put his hands down on the ice during the landing.\n\nBut he still earned 10.07 points for that move, which is nearly 3 points more than the maximum value he would have received for a well-executed triple jump.\n\nWhile Chen won the long program, Hanyu, 23, got higher marks for artistry. In addition to points for technical elements like quads, skaters also receive marks for the quality of their skating, called the \u201cprogram components\u201d score. It is measured in categories like skating skills, choreography and musical interpretation.\n\nThis is where Hanyu stands apart. The Japanese skater, who is recovering from an ankle injury, scored 9 points higher than Chen on his component score, showing off nearly an entire quad\u2019s worth of hidden advantage.\n\nAn artistic sequence near the end of the long program of Yuzuru Hanyu, who won the gold medal for Japan on Saturday, as he had in Sochi in 2014.

The quad toe loop-triple toe loop combo scored a huge 17.63 points by itself. Chen also did well on the more subjective judging elements, getting over 9 for performance. He takes a big lead over the other early skaters, by a full 40 points.\n\nIt was a redemptive and audaciously ambitious performance. Chen became the first Olympian to land five quadruple jumps cleanly in a routine and actually attempted six, but put his hands to the ice on the quad flip. His score of 297.35 could put him in medal contention if the leaders struggle later.\n\nBrendan Kerry Invokes Pink Floyd\n\nBrendan Kerry of Australia has had some of the more intriguing musical choices of the event. In the short program he skated to an eerie cover of \u201cEverybody Wants to Rule the World.\u201d For the free skate he chose a Pink Floyd medley, including \u201cShine on You Crazy Diamond\u201d and \u201cMoney.\u201d But his performance wasn\u2019t quite up to snuff and he bailed out of his quads. That concluded the second group of six skaters. Twelve to go. Chen still leads by 40 points.\n\nPhoto\n\nKeegan Messing Puts on a Show\n\nThe Olympics are at their heart, a sports competition, but no one has had more fun here than Keegan Messing of Canada, who entertained the crowd with a Charlie Chaplin routine on Saturday after skating to Singin\u2019 in the Rain on Friday.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe is unapologetic about being a showman as much as a competitor. \u201cI just feel like I can bring the crowd in; it makes my skating so much more fun for me,\u201d he said. Messing also hit two quads and moved into third place.\n\nNathan Chen Made a \u201cGame-Time Decision\u201d to Try 6 Quads\n\nLeader Nathan Chen spoke after his amazing program:\n\n\u201cHaving such a rough short program allowed me to just forget about expectations and just allow myself to really enjoy myself,\u201d Chen said. \u201cI think six quads was almost a game-time decision, I knew at that point that I had literally nothing to lose.\n\n\u201cAs much as I tried to deny it, I felt the pressure a lot before the short program, especially thinking about scores and placement and all that. And that was completely out of my control. That just tightened me up and made me really cautious on the ice.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nVincent Zhou Nearly Matches Nathan Chen\n\nVincent Zhou, 17, exceeded expectations in his short program, placing 12th. And he rolled out an ambitious five-quad free skate. And like his countryman Nathan Chen, he delivered.\n\nIn skating\u2019s complicated scoring system, Zhou was credited with four quadruple jumps, three of them landed cleanly. He put his hand to the ice on a quad flip. And his attempt to become the first Olympic skater to land two quad Lutzes \u2014 the most difficult of the four-revolution jumps being performed \u2014 came up short. His second Lutz was judged to have been under-rotated. Still, his score for the long program was a lifetime best of 192.16 points.\n\nHis technical score was only 7 off Chen\u2019s and he moved into second place overall, 21 points down. Zhou is definitely one to watch for 2022.\n\nPhoto\n\nAdam Rippon Skates a Clean Program, but No Quads\n\nAdam Rippon, the man with the killer abs, was the final American to skate. A program without quads would make it difficult to finish high, but he wheeled out all his showmanship, including birdlike motions while skating to Coldplay\u2019s \u201cArrival of the Birds.\u201d And he landed all those triples.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRippon skated with his accustomed elegance, but the jumping prowess of Nathan Chen and Vincent Zhou illustrated the gulf between his artistry and the bold athleticism needed to score highly under today\u2019s scoring system.\n\nWith six more to skate, the American men can finish no lower than 7th, 8th and 10th. This is the fourth time in the last five Olympics that all three men have made the top 10. The last time was 2010, when Evan Lysacek won the gold medal, Johnny Weir finished sixth and Jeremy Abbott took ninth.\n\nDmitri Aliev Struggles\n\nDmitri Aliev, the 18-year-old Russian, was the first of the final six to skate and probably the least likely winner, with only two quads in his program. He wound up falling as well and can only place third, though that\u2019s not likely.\n\nJin Boyang Passes Nathan Chen for First Place\n\nJin Boyang of China was fourth after the short program and planned a four-quad program set to \u201cThe Planets\u201d and the Cantina Theme and other music from \u201cStar Wars.\u201d Jin delivered an almost clean routine, marred by one fall. His free skate score was lower than Nathan Chen\u2019s, but Jin had a 21-point lead over Chen after the short program. It adds up to a new leader by less than a point. Chen is back in second.\n\nPatrick Chan Can\u2019t Make Up Ground\n\nPatrick Chan of Canada was sixth after the short program. His routine, set to Jeff Buckley\u2019s version of \u201cHallelujah,\u201d had two quads, both right at the top. He landed the first and stepped out of the second one slightly. He also put a hand down on a later jump and had an unprovoked stumble. An always dignified skater, the 27-year-old Chan stood only in sixth. Next up, the leader and gold medal favorite, Yuzuru Hanyu.\n\nPhoto\n\nYuzuru Hanyu Leads After Strong Routine\n\nYuzuru Hanyu of Japan, the world\u2019s most famous Winnie the Pooh enthusiast, had the gold medal for the taking, with the lead and a four-quad performance planned. He nailed the first three, but stumbled on the fourth, a planned quad-single-triple combination. It might have been enough for the gold, but Hanyu threw in one more unplanned quad for good measure. One more small stumble came on a triple, but Hanyu laid down a strong performance that will make him hard to catch. Winnie the Pooh dolls rained down from the audience in the aftermath.\n\nHanyu took over first place. His free skate score was 6 points lower than Chen\u2019s but combined with the short program he claimed a 20-point lead.\n\nPhoto\n\nJavier Fernandez in 2nd Place After Strong Routine\n\nJavier Fernandez of Spain was fourth four years ago, but he put himself in position to get a medal this time. After a strong second in the short program, he delivered in his free skate to Man of La Mancha, completing two of his three planned quads. The last skater will be Shoma Uno of Japan, with the current medal positions Hanyu-Fernandez-Jin. The American Nathan Chen has slipped to fourth place.\n\nShoma Uno Passes Fernandez for Silver\n\nIt all came down to Shoma Uno, who could get a medal and maybe even the gold if he nailed his four-quad program set to Turandot. But he fell on Quad No. 1 and stepped out of a combo. It was good enough for second place, and Yuzuru Hanyu repeated as the men\u2019s Olympic champion.

But major mistakes in his short program the day before kept him off the podium. He ended in fifth place.\n\nWe tracked the number of quadruple jumps attempted by each skater:\n\nQuadruple Jumps Attempted in Free Skate Note: Judges score each element on a scale from \u20133 to +3. We\u2019re counting successful attempts as quad jumps by themselves or in combinations for which the average of the judges\u2019 grades of execution is greater than \u20132. We are throwing out the scores of the highest and lowest judges, just as it is done in the official scoring system. Skaters who did not attempt quads are not shown.\n\nA quad, which is a jump that has four revolutions, has the highest base value in figure skating and is generally worth more than twice the equivalent triple jump. For example, a triple lutz has a base value of 6 points. A quad lutz is worth 13.6 points.\n\nThis creates a powerful incentive for skaters to try a quad in competition even if they are not consistently landing the jump.\n\nSkaters also gain or lose additional points depending on how well the quad is executed. And any jump done in the second half of a program, when skaters\u2019 legs are tired, gets a 10 percent bonus.\n\nFor example, below are the 13 elements of the long program of Yuzuru Hanyu of Japan, performed at the 2017 world championships, in the order that he executed them. Three elements were quad jumps by themselves, and one more was a quad in combination with another jump.\n\nQuad combo Triple combo Quad Quad Triple Quad Triple Spin Step sequence Spin Step sequence Spin Quad combo Triple combo Quad Quad Triple Quad Triple Spin Step sequence Spin Step sequence Spin Quad combo Triple combo Quad Quad Triple Quad Triple Spin Step sequence Spin Step sequence Spin Quad combo Triple combo Quad Quad Triple Quad Triple Spin Step sequence Spin Step sequence Spin Source: International Skating Union\n\nHe waited to do his last two quads until he had passed the halfway point of his program.\n\nNathan Chen of the United States and Shoma Uno of Japan have most consistently attempted five quads in recent competitions. Hanyu and Jin Boyang of China have often attempted four. Spain\u2019s Javier Fernandez has tried as many as three.\n\nNumber of quads in each skater\u2019s 10 most recent major competitions\n\nHanyu, Fernandez, Uno and Jin are the leaders going into Saturday\u2019s long program competition.\n\nChen, who was America\u2019s hope for a gold medal in the men\u2019s individual event, made major errors in his short program, practically taking him out of contention.\n\nMathematically, packing in as many quads as possible may seem like the only route to the podium for any of the skaters.\n\nThat may be, unless we\u2019re talking about Hanyu, the gold medalist in Sochi four years ago, who was the winner of the short program here.\n\nWhile skaters earn points for the elements, like quads, of a program, they also receive a score for the quality of their skating, called the \u201cprogram components\u201d score. It is measured in categories like skating skills, choreography and musical interpretation.\n\nThis is where Hanyu stands apart. He is often points ahead of his competition in artistry and gets higher marks for how well he executes his technical elements as well.\n\nYuzuru Hanyu performing in Friday\u2019s short program event.

South Korea built a competitive curling program before the Olympics, but the sport\u2019s popularity is not particularly widespread here. Fans cheer a lot, but sometimes for poor shots. In any case, the South Korean women\u2019s team is a medal contender and proved as much by upsetting Canada in its opening match of the tournament.\n\nIt was a bittersweet, if mostly bitter, result for Canadian fans: Peter Gallant, South Korea\u2019s coach, is from Prince Edward Island.\n\nIs Canada still the team to beat in men\u2019s hockey even without current N.H.L. players on its team?\n\nPhoto\n\nThe men\u2019s hockey draw seems like a total tossup. Traditional powerhouses like the United States and Russia \u2014 or the team that used to be known as Russia \u2014 lost their opening matches. Canada defeated Switzerland in its first match of the tournament in front of a mostly empty house at Gangneung Ice Arena.\n\nWithout the star power that N.H.L. players delivered at previous Olympics, the tournament is struggling to attract many eyeballs. Teams have filled their rosters with players who are toiling away in lesser leagues or are at the end of their career \u2014 and that includes Canada, which went with older players while leaving younger prospects at home.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe result is that chemistry will need to be built on the fly, and nobody seems too sure how this tournament will pan out. But Canada should contend for gold. It\u2019s still hockey, after all.\n\nPhoto\n\nThis link will whisk you to all of our Winter Games coverage.

Unlike virtual reality, another technology we\u2019ve been exploring, augmented reality doesn\u2019t require cardboard goggles. But, right now at least, you can only experience the full effect by using an iPhone 6S, SE or newer. For the Olympics, we\u2019ve used the technology to take a unique look at four athletes.

(Don\u2019t bother checking my past results.) My travel schedule and the on-and-off winter in Ottawa mean that I\u2019m just skiing occasionally with my wife this year. I\u2019m also the household\u2019s wax technician. But the grumbling I hear when I get the wax wrong is nothing compared with what Knut Nystad experiences. David Segal reported that Mr. Nystad, the chief of Norway\u2019s 30-strong crew of Olympic wax techs, becomes public enemy No. 1 back home when his team messes up.\n\nCross-country skiing is to Norway what hockey is to Canada. Mr. Segal looked into Norway\u2019s equivalent of Sept. 28, 1972. (For non-Canadian readers: that\u2019s the day that Paul Henderson scored the winning goal against the Russians in the Summit series.) In this case, the defining moment was the breaking of Oddvar Bra\u2019s ski pole at 1:54 p.m. on Feb. 25, 1982, which became the stuff of national legend in Norway.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u2014Here\u2019s the diet of Adam Rippon, an American figure skater, from two years ago: three slices of whole grain bread topped with pats of I Can\u2019t Believe It\u2019s Not Butter spread, supplemented by three cups of coffee, each laced with six packets of artificial sweetener.

Adam hangs face down in the chair with the cushion supporting him on the hips. For this exercise, Adam uses a 25-pound medicine ball, but you can use a lighter weight, even a five-pound ball or no ball at all. It is best to have someone with you, but you can modify the exercise so you can do it alone.\n\nStart in the bent-over position on the chair with the ball on the floor a little to the left. Put both hands on the ball. Lift and rotate your body so you can throw the ball to your right. Basically, Adam reaches for the ball on his left and twists to whip the ball to the right. For Adam, this is functional because he\u2019s jumping and rotating on the ice. This should burn, but if it\u2019s really hurting, then stop. Start off slow without a weighted ball and just go through the twist and the motion. Then add the weighted ball. If you don\u2019t have a partner, just lift the ball up and twist but don\u2019t throw. Make sure you only do one side 10 times and then do the other side. If you go back and forth you can wrench your back. (Four sets of 20; 10 on the right, 10 on the left.)\n\nElevated Running Man: Adam hangs from straps in a metal cage, and wears a resistance band around each ankle that is also connected to the nearest cage post. He drives his left knee up toward his right elbow, crossing his body to create resistance. It makes the abs really strong, and it\u2019s connecting the lower part of the body up through the abs to the upper body. It mimics the movement they do on the ice when you see them jump and cross their legs. If we end the workout with this, we\u2019ll do sets of 20. But if it\u2019s early in the abs workout, we\u2019ll do 40. (Four sets of 20; alternating right and left side.)\n\nPhoto\n\nTwisting Pike: Adam hangs from the straps again and he holds a smaller, 35-millimeter Swiss therapy ball between his ankles. Next he lifts his legs to a pike position, so his legs are parallel to the floor. He twists to the right as far as he can, and then to the left. He twists right, left, right, left \u2014 it\u2019s not easy. It\u2019s mimicking what the ab does internally when he\u2019s jumping and rotating. It isolates the abdominal area, but we want to balance between the abdominal area and the rest of the body, so that\u2019s why he does these more connecting movements. You don\u2019t want to overdevelop one part. Everything is symmetrical and balanced. (Four sets of 20; alternating right and left side.)\n\nRecovery Meal: After the workout, I require Adam to eat within 30 minutes. He eats protein \u2014 chicken, fish or beef and maybe a salad. You need your carbs, but nobody needs bread, pasta or rice. He gets his carbs from fruits and vegetables, like yams.\n\nChange It Up: Every workout, we change the order and maybe add something different. The body gets bored, so we like to mix up the order every time.\n\nSave Abs for the End: Because the abdominal muscles work together with the muscles in the back to protect the spine, you don\u2019t want to tire them out at the beginning of a workout. We always save the ab work for the end of the training day. We\u2019ll spend 25 minutes on abs, but it\u2019s always the last thing, our big finale.", "keywords": ["left", "abs", "dont", "secret", "workout", "adam", "sets", "right", "ball", "body", "20", "olympic", "rippons"], "polarity": 0.07950439040864571, "subjectivity": 0.33916751097602166}
