Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, have promised a raft of new measures to address the problem.\n\nPhoto\n\nAlbany has a checkered record when it comes to sexual harassment, on both sides of the aisle, perhaps most notably of the disgraced Democratic power broker, Assemblyman Vito J. Lopez. Mr. Lopez was accused in 2012 of sexually harassing several female staff members, graphic incidents, including groping, which later led to his resignation.\n\nIn 2014, a Buffalo-area assemblyman, Dennis H. Gabryszak, a Democrat, stepped down amid accusations that he sexually harassed several female staff members. In 2016, Angela M. Wozniak, a first-term Republican from western New York, was censured after an affair with a male staffer; she did not seek re-election.\n\nAnd as recently as last fall, the former Assemblyman Steven T. McLaughlin, an outspoken Republican, was disciplined for asking a female staff member to send him naked pictures of herself.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDuring the Lopez scandal, Sheldon Silver, then the speaker of the Assembly, was also harshly criticized for authorizing secret financial settlements to harassment victims. Such payments are now the subject of proposals from both Mr. Cuomo and Senate Republicans, who introduced a bill last week that would outlaw such confidential settlements, echoing a similar push by Senate Democrats in January.\n\nThe Assembly has already passed internal rules banning confidential settlements, and has made other reforms, including the mandatory reporting of any sexual harassment complaint. It, too, is expected to introduce legislation confronting sexual harassment on Monday, after establishing a work group of members last month to study the issue.\n\nThe seeming commonality of purpose greatly increases the likelihood of a deal on the issue, even if the question of who will be doing the negotiating remains unsettled.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Heastie, the Assembly speaker \u2014 has expanded to include Senator Jeffrey D. Klein, the leader of the eight-member Independent Democratic Conference, a breakaway cadre of Democrats who collaborate with Mr. Flanagan to help rule the Senate.\n\nIn February, the governor\u2019s office indicated that Senator Andrea Stewart-Cousins, the leader of the minority Democratic conference, would be part of negotiations, something she has asked to do. But on Friday, Mr. Cuomo\u2019s office would not explicitly say that Ms. Stewart-Cousins would actually be in the negotiation room during talks among the four men; rather, they said she would \u201cbe included,\u201d without clarifying what that means.\n\nPotentially further muddying negotiations is the situation surrounding Mr. Klein, who himself has been accused of forcibly kissing a former staffer in 2015. Mr. Klein denies that accusation, and his political partner in the Senate, Mr. Flanagan, has declined to investigate, saying that the accuser, Erica Vladimer, did not make a formal complaint. (Mr. Klein has since asked for a formal investigation from a state ethics panel.),\n\nMr. Flanagan was also criticized for approving a new sexual harassment policy that added an admonition to false accusers, which led some Albany observers to question whether the Legislature\u2019s heart was behind the measures.\n\n\u201cProcess is as important as outcome,\u201d said Alexis Grenell, a public affairs consultant and writer who once worked in state government. She added that the governor and others should include experts in sexual harassment and those who have reported being harassed, and even those who have been harassed and not reported it for fear of retaliation. \u201cAn all-male decision-making body is conflicted out of arriving at a meaningful solution,\u201d she said.\n\nIndeed, even the governor has been accused of talking in a patronizing manner in December to a female reporter in Albany. The reporter, Karen DeWitt, asked Mr. Cuomo a question about sexual harassment in state government; the governor shot back that she was doing \u201ca disservice to women\u201d by limiting the question\u2019s scope to Albany.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe state Democratic Party, controlled by Mr. Cuomo, started a campaign on Wednesday to pass Mr. Cuomo\u2019s so-called Women\u2019s Agenda, quoting the governor as saying \u201c2018 will be the year for action against the culture of rampant sexism and misogyny.\u201d\n\nMs. Simon, who represents parts of Brooklyn, said that \u201cthere is almost no woman I know who has not been treated differently, and treated badly.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlbany is no different from the rest of the world,\u201d she added. \u201cNot that long ago we were chattel.\u201d\n\nMs. Paulin plans to introduce legislation to require a survey every two years \u2014 coinciding with when a new Legislature is seated \u2014 to \u201cmeasure the legislative workplace climate as it relates to discrimination and harassment procedure.\u201d The letter itself asks the state to convene a task force \u201cto examine the pervasiveness of the problem of sexual harassment\u201d in New York workplaces, and \u201cevaluate the effectiveness of current policies and laws.\u201d\n\nAs for the incidents she said she had personally witnessed, she said she was uncomfortable about naming names.\n\n\u201cThis should not be about individuals but about the entire systemic change we need,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd while those signing are not necessarily alleging misbehavior in their current workplaces in Albany, the letter\u2019s final line might well serve as a notice for the state\u2019s policymakers, Ms. Paulin said.\n\n\u201cOur work,\u201d it reads, \u201chas just begun.\u201d", "keywords": ["mr", "staff", "state", "letter", "shadows", "behavior", "cuomo", "york", "bad", "members", "senate", "sexual", "bipartisan", "harassment", "tackling"], "polarity": 0.08447454576486833, "subjectivity": 0.4381770857577307},

Smith, Pew\u2019s associate director of research, who also noted a nine-point drop among evangelical men. \u201cBoth groups have become less approving over time.\u201d\n\nIf that drop in support translates into a lack of enthusiasm among core Trump supporters in the midterm elections in November, as it did for many of President Barack Obama\u2019s voters in 2010, the Republican Party could be more vulnerable in its efforts to maintain control of Congress. In 2020, it would also possibly open a lane for a primary challenger to the president.\n\nThe women in suburban Dallas all conceded they have cringed sometimes at Mr. Trump, citing his pettiness, impulsiveness, profanity and name calling. Still, they defended him because he delivered on issues they cared most about, such as the appointment of Justice Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cCertainly we are all embarrassed, but for the most part he represents what we stand for,\u201d said Ms. Leonhart, who is active in the women\u2019s ministry at her church.\n\nA clear majority of white evangelical women, even in the face of the #MeToo movement and renewed claims of marital infidelity against the president, continue, along with white evangelical men, to form Mr. Trump\u2019s most cohesive block of support.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s ability to connect so strongly with evangelical voters was among the most notable surprises of the 2016 campaign. Since his election, he has courted evangelical leaders aggressively and, more important, has delivered on promises to appoint conservatives like Justice Gorsuch to federal courts. Men who see themselves as leaders of religious conservatives, such as Franklin Graham, Jerry Falwell Jr. and Tony Perkins, the president of the Family Research Council, have remained doggedly supportive.\n\nAnd the majority of evangelical women remain in his corner.\n\nBut it has not been easy.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know any evangelical woman who is going to defend the character of the president,\u201d said Carmen Fowler LaBerge, host of \u201cThe Reconnect,\u201d an evangelical-centered radio show.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cMany things the president says and does are things that many evangelicals use as examples with our kids of what we should not do,\u201d added Ms. LaBerge, who did not support Mr. Trump in 2016. \u201cThis is not who we are as evangelicals. This is not how we treat people.\u201d\n\nSome evangelical women simply keep their views private. Gathered at a well-appointed home in Falls Church, Va., last week, eight Christian women agreed to talk about their feelings about the president, on one condition: that they not be identified.\n\nThey feared reprisal in the workplace, at their children\u2019s schools, even at their church. They meet in secret and have a private Facebook group, which its organizer said has about 160 members, to talk about their support for Mr. Trump.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

One of the women said that her parents had come to the United States illegally from El Salvador and that she was born a short time later. Her father is now a citizen. She supports Mr. Trump and his hard-line plans on immigration.\n\n\u201cI would say that this year has only made me more of a certain supporter,\u201d said another of the women, Joanna, who agreed to be identified only by her first name. \u201cI\u2019ve been really excited to see him come through with his promises, one by one, against incredible odds.\u201d\n\nStill, there is a tension among evangelical women. They said they largely cast their votes against Hillary Clinton more than for Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cAt least in my experience, it was more of an anti-Hillary vote than a pro-Trump vote,\u201d Ms. LaBerge said.\n\nKaren Swallow Prior, a professor at Liberty University who opposed Mr. Trump and voted for a third-party candidate, said, \u201cNow that Trump is in office and we are evaluating his performance then, I am glad to see that people are less in lock step and thinking critically about him as a leader, and it doesn\u2019t surprise me that his overall support would decline from 80 percent.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was one of those culture war evangelicals in the \u201980s and \u201990s,\u201d Ms. Swallow Prior said. \u201cI was appalled by the candidacy and presidency of Bill Clinton. It was hammered into my mind that character mattered, and that did change when Trump came along. In some ways, I felt betrayed by my evangelical peers who taught me and cemented in me the idea that character matters. I didn\u2019t abandon that belief. I feel like some evangelicals did.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHer outspoken criticism is all the more notable given that the president of Liberty University, Mr. Falwell, remains one of the president\u2019s most vocal defenders.\n\nEvangelical voters, often portrayed as a monolith, are becoming increasingly difficult to define. The support for Mr. Trump reflects a growing pragmatism among evangelical voters who are willing to accept a less than ideal model of Christian faith in exchange for policies that they endorse.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019ve become experienced and very practical,\u201d said Frances FitzGerald, the author of the recent book \u201cThe Evangelicals: The Struggle to Shape America.\u201d \u201cBy large majorities they used to believe that to be elected, you had to be of good character. No longer. It\u2019s \u2018We want a president to do what we want him to do, and he\u2019s going to do it if we turn out and vote.\u2019\u201d\n\nMr. Trump also appeals to white evangelicals in other ways with his strong language, disruptive view of presidential norms and his policies on taxes. \u201cReligious right rhetoric has always been very martial \u2014 isolationist and martial at the same time,\u201d Ms. FitzGerald said.\n\nIn surveys conducted by LifeWay Research in Nashville, evangelical voters in 2016 cited the economy (30 percent) and national security (26 percent) as their top two issues. Abortion was cited by just 4 percent, said Scott McConnell, the company\u2019s executive director.\n\nEvangelical voters began to emerge as a political force with their support for Ronald Reagan in 1980 and became a more coherent movement with the 1988 presidential campaign of the religious broadcaster Pat Robertson and the rise of Christian Coalition. But there are now few obvious leaders of religious conservatism, and voters have become more conventional in their assessment of candidates.\n\nAnd even among religious conservatives, the Pew poll suggests tolerance for Mr. Trump has its limits.\n\n\u201cIt may simply be that there\u2019s not a single breaking point as much as a tipping point, the \u2018Oh Lord, I can\u2019t stand another one of these,\u2019\u201d said William Martin, a scholar at the Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University and author of \u201cWith God on Our Side,\u201d which charted the political rise of the religious right.", "keywords": ["white", "supporters", "mr", "core", "evangelicals", "support", "ms", "trump", "president", "religious", "evangelical", "begin", "women", "tiptoeing", "voters", "away"], "polarity": 0.16382375340708674, "subjectivity": 0.42349687349687354},

And they want to build momentum and voter enthusiasm for the midterm elections in the fall, when they hope to topple Republican control of the House of Representatives.\n\nFor their part, Republicans are anxious to secure President Trump\u2019s popularity with his heartland base, break a streak of weak showings in special elections since he took office, and dispel the Democratic narrative of a rising tide of anti-Trump and anti-Republican sentiment among voters. They want the political map to stay the way Mr. Trump recolored it in 2016.\n\nWhether Mr. Lamb wins or loses \u2014 polls suggest a dead heat in a district that President Trump won by about 20 percentage points \u2014 the lessons from the race will resonate throughout the heartland in November. Democrats will be defending vulnerable Senate seats and trying to pick up House districts and governors\u2019 mansions in Pennsylvania, Ohio and other states where Mrs. Clinton fell short.\n\nMr. Lamb has been able to make the race close in such a deep-red district in part because of his moderate views on social issues like guns. He insists that he is not running against Mr. Trump. And he agrees with the president on the need for protective tariffs on steel and aluminum.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Trump himself visited the region on Saturday to champion his 25 percent steel tariff, which is broadly popular here in the crucible of American steel, and also to throw a protective cloak around the embattled Republican in the House race, Rick Saccone.\n\n\u201cYour steel is coming back,\u201d Mr. Trump declared.\n\nIn his trademark fashion, he tagged Mr. Lamb with an insulting nickname, Lamb the Sham, and claimed to be better looking than the tall, square-jawed, 33-year-old former Marine and prosecutor.\n\nMr. Trump predicted that while Mr. Lamb may act like a centrist, he would fall in line behind liberal party leaders in Washington. \u201cFor getting your votes, he\u2019s talking about how much he likes tariffs, which is my baby,\u201d the president said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt is unclear whether voters\u2019 approval of Mr. Trump, which is still strong in the district, will translate into ballots cast for Mr. Saccone, 60, a state representative and former Air Force counterintelligence officer.\n\nUnion leaders insisted that many voters in the district would effectively split their tickets, backing the Democratic Party this year even if they had cast ballots for Mr. Trump in 2016.\n\nOrganized labor has been losing ground in the American workplace for years, but unions are still politically potent in places like the 18th District, where union carpenters, steelworkers, nurses and other tradespeople and their families account for nearly one in four votes.\n\nIt is a district with a minority population of just 7 percent, making unions there a proxy for the white working class. Those voters had been drifting away from the Democrats, a trend that accelerated in 2016, and the party desperately wants to win back their support.\n\nProtectionist tariffs, which most economists warn will hurt more American workers than they help, were a Democratic rallying cry before the era of Bill Clinton. As a candidate, Mr. Trump appropriated the issue, as part of his pledge to restore factories to beleaguered cities. That stance helped pave the way for the narrow victories over Mrs. Clinton in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan that won him the White House.\n\nAccording to internal polling by the A.F.L.-C.I.O., Mrs. Clinton won 10 percent fewer union votes than former President Barack Obama did in 2012.\n\nPhoto\n\nMany of the voters were indifferent to the Clinton campaign\u2019s attacks on Mr. Trump\u2019s character, which blanketed the airwaves, while he broke through to them with his racially tinged \u201cAmerica First\u201d appeals.\n\n\u201cA lot of our members just didn\u2019t trust Hillary Clinton,\u201d said Tim Waters, the political director of the United Steelworkers. \u201cDonald Trump talked a lot about working-class voter issues, especially on trade. It resonated with a lot of people in working-class neighborhoods. We\u2019re hoping that in 2018, the Democratic Party figures out you can\u2019t have the same message in Phoenix that you have in Pittsburgh.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nUnions have a ready foil in Mr. Saccone, who supports so-called right-to-work legislation in Harrisburg, the state capital, and who opposed requiring the use of American-made materials in public projects.

Outside the gates of an Allegheny Technologies steel plant in Washington, Pa., deep in the 18th District, workers coming and going during the changeover to the afternoon shift almost all said they had voted for Mr. Trump.\n\nMost said they still approved of the president\u2019s job performance, and for some, that support extended to Mr. Saccone as well. A number took at face value the flood of TV attack ads that outside Republican groups had been airing, trying to tie Mr. Lamb to Representative Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader, whose social positions make her unpopular here.\n\n\u201cIf he\u2019s a Nancy Pelosi supporter, I\u2019m not going to vote for him,\u201d Brad Phillips, 45, said.\n\nMr. Lamb has said repeatedly that he would defy Ms. Pelosi. But a Republican attack ad insists that he, like Ms. Pelosi, favors cuts to Medicare \u2014 a hoary accusation based on the Affordable Care Act\u2019s reduction of payments to health providers. (Republicans in Congress retain those same reductions in their bills to repeal the health law.)\n\nMr. Phillips seemed to cite that attack ad as evidence of Mr. Lamb\u2019s duplicity. \u201cSome of the things she\u2019s supported, he\u2019s backed her,\u201d he said.\n\nPhoto\n\nJim Harris, who has worked 31 years at the mill, said he switched his voter registration to Republican a few years ago, and although he is not enthusiastic about Mr. Saccone, he likes Mr. Lamb less. \u201cI can\u2019t go with them Democrats no more,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re against everything I believe in.\u201d Referring to abortion rights and gun control, he said, \u201cThey\u2019re against God, they\u2019re killing kids, they want our guns.\u201d\n\nFor Kellen Hodge, 60, the Pelosi attack ads also made an impression, but he was skeptical of them because he takes it for granted that all politicians lie. Mr. Lamb appealed to him, he said, because he has never held office before. \u201cI am a Republican, but I probably will vote for Conor Lamb because he is new blood.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe skeptical attitude some rank-and-file steelworkers have toward Mr. Lamb suggests that Democrats face challenges in winning back white working-class voters they lost in 2016.\n\nJohn Russo, a retired labor studies professor at Youngstown State University, recently took most Ohio Democrats running in 2018 to task for offering \u201calmost nothing in the way of concrete economic platforms.\u201d\n\nStanley Greenberg, a Democratic pollster who first identified the phenomenon of Reagan Democrats, was also critical of the party. \u201cHave they put working people at the center of their agenda?\u201d he asked. \u201cDo working people believe Democrats wake up each day worrying about whether those folks are able to get ahead? I think there\u2019s still a long way to go.\u201d\n\nWithin the party, there is a boisterous faction that argues that the Democrats\u2019 future lies with college-educated suburbanites and minorities, and that trying to win back white working-class voters may be a lost cause.\n\nOne reason Mr. Lamb seems poised to exceed expectations for a Democrat in his district is the anti-Trump fervor of progressive voters concentrated in the white-collar suburbs close to Pittsburgh.\n\nThese voters have swamped the polls in nearly every election of the past year, from Virginia to rural Wisconsin, and Democrats have been outperforming their November 2016 results in race after race.\n\nChuck Moser, a sales director for Cisco who held a fund-raiser for Mr. Lamb at a private club in Sewickley, an affluent suburb, waited in a long line last week to hear former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. campaign for Mr. Lamb.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t previously stood out in chilly weather waiting to go to rallies,\u201d he said.\n\nHe and his wife, Barb, 40, described themselves as more liberal than Mr. Lamb.\n\nMr. Moser said voters like them would make an important difference on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cHe really does not want to run against Donald Trump in this district,\u201d Mr. Moser said of Mr. Lamb. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t mention his name. He doesn\u2019t contrast himself. But what I\u2019m seeing is, a lot of the energy for the Democrats is based upon the dislike of Donald Trump.

Despite the other benefits of the law, he said, he would rather be governed by the old tax code than face a competitive disadvantage to nearby cooperatives.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThomas Lien Jr., of Dakota Mill and Grain in Rapid City, S.D., said that he already regretted the $20 million investment his business made last year to build a shuttle loader grain elevator for moving large quantities of grain because farmers were now only interested in selling to cooperatives. Now he wondered how his business and others like it could survive.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to drive investments in rural America away,\u201d Mr. Lien said. \u201cWe can\u2019t compete.\u201d\n\nRestaurants and retailers are also concerned about a drafting error that will mitigate the tax benefits they receive when renovating. The law was supposed to simplify depreciation rules for businesses making renovations or other property improvements so that they could deduct these expenses over 15 years. Because of a mistake in the writing of the bill, the cost of these investments must be deducted over 39 years, diminishing the intended benefit.\n\nThe top lobbyist for the restaurant industry said that she was hopeful that lawmakers had heard their complaints.\n\n\u201cIt is our understanding that it was an honest mistake,\u201d said the lobbyist, Cicely Simpson, the executive vice president of public affairs at the National Restaurant Association. \u201cThe bipartisan intent behind the law was a 15-year depreciation period, and we are confident Congress will have this resolved quickly.\u201d\n\nBut legislative fixes will be tough. Unlike the original tax bill, which passed along party lines, legislation correcting any portion of the tax bill will require Democratic votes to get through the Senate.\n\nThe law passed Congress via the budget reconciliation process, which bypassed a Senate filibuster and enabled Republicans to approve it on a party-line vote in both chambers. A fix-it bill would need at least nine Democrats in the Senate to join Republicans.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

They are still fuming over the partisan process that delivered the bill to President Trump\u2019s desk.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI\u2019m willing to make technical changes, but they have to be substantive, too,\u201d said Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio and a member of the Finance Committee. \u201cWe\u2019re not just going to sit down and fix the things they did badly because they did it in the dead of night with lobbyists at the table.\u201d\n\nA second, much larger group of issues are those that need Treasury clarification \u2014 areas of the law that companies say could be construed in any number of ways, with vastly differing consequences for tax liabilities.\n\nThat includes questions over which businesses, and what types of business income, qualify for a new 20 percent deduction for so-called pass-through entities, whose owners pay taxes on the companies\u2019 profits through the individual code. For example, the Chamber of Commerce is pushing to ensure the deduction applies to investors in mutual funds that own stakes in real estate investment trusts.\n\nIt also includes a dizzying number of concerns over the new system for taxing multinational corporations that the law created.\n\nPhoto\n\nThose corporations are upset over the possible scope of two provisions that collectively form a sort of alternative minimum tax for companies operating in the United States and overseas. The bill\u2019s architects pitched those provisions as a means of cracking down on companies that shift profits to foreign parent companies or subsidiaries to avoid American taxes.\n\nBut affected companies say they fear the legislation could be construed overly broadly by officials at Treasury or the Internal Revenue Service, subjecting activities that those companies do not consider forms of profit-shifting to the minimum tax.\n\nA Chevron executive called one of the minimum tax provisions \u201ca disaster\u201d last month at a public forum. At the same event, an Eli Lilly official said the provisions discouraged companies from holding intellectual property in the United States, counter to the intent of Congress, because they forced those companies to reimburse foreign affiliates doing work outside the country.\n\nMany companies are looking to Treasury to resolve those concerns. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce\u2019s list of requests includes several suggestions for ways the department can limit the minimum tax\u2019s reach.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRepublican lawmakers who wrote the bill, however, are not looking kindly on efforts to change the intent of the law. Their staff members say they have asked businesses to make a data-based case for why their proposals are necessary.\n\n\u201cI stress the importance of carrying out legislative intent,\u201d Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and the chairman of the Finance Committee, wrote in a letter last month to Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary. The intent, he added, was to remove \u201cdamaging tax-base erosion found in the former tax system\u201d \u2014 a reference to eroding the tax base of the United States by shifting corporate profits abroad.\n\nRohit Kumar, a former Senate leadership aide who now leads a tax policy group at the accounting firm PwC, said turmoil in the first months of a new and sweeping law was to be expected. \u201cEveryone needs to stop and take a deep breath,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is normal, against the magnitude of the change.\u201d\n\nStill, companies that want change will undoubtedly continue pressuring Congress, Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service, Mr. Kumar said.\n\n\u201cNature favors the bold,\u201d he added. \u201cI suppose you could just sit back and wait, but a better strategy is to be engaging with Treasury and I.R.S., and engaging with the Hill.\u201d\n\nDavid J. Kautter, the acting commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service and Treasury\u2019s assistant secretary for tax policy, said last month that the agency had a detailed plan for introducing clarifications and, when possible, fixes to the legislation.\n\n\u201cWe have multiple work teams focused on the entire bill,\u201d Mr. Kautter said. \u201cWe\u2019re going full bore on guidance.\u201d\n\nRepublicans and lobbyists say they are optimistic that Congress will act soon on at least the grain glitch. Some lawmakers have been musing about stuffing more fixes into a big, must-pass spending bill expected this month.\n\nBut that bill would require the support of the Democratic Party, and could give it an ability to demand something in return \u2014 such as rollbacks of limitations on state and local tax deductions, which primarily hurt taxpayers in liberal states.", "keywords": ["rushed", "bill", "grain", "states", "altered", "legislation", "overhaul", "treasury", "tax", "need", "companies", "say", "pass", "law", "farmers", "gop"], "polarity": 0.06755706414797326, "subjectivity": 0.39432621671258017},

Throughout last year, Mr. Cobb kept Mr. Trump from publicly airing grievances against Mr. Mueller in part by telling him that the investigation would be wrapped up by December, or soon after \u2014 an assessment that proved too optimistic.\n\nBut there have been signs in recent months that Mr. Trump may be looking to shake up his legal team and change his approach to Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation. The president has polled his advisers and friends, asking them what they think of Mr. Cobb, who persuaded Mr. Trump to take a cooperative approach to the inquiry.\n\nIn private conversations, Mr. Trump has seesawed between expressing confidence in Mr. Cobb\u2019s claim that the inquiry will wrap up in relatively short order and that he will be exonerated, and sounding frustrated with his team\u2019s legal strategy.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Cobb has clashed with the White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, who believed that Mr. Cobb was too willing to hand over documents to Mr. Mueller when the White House could have shielded them by citing executive or attorney-client privilege. Officials familiar with the discussions with Mr. Flood said they were unrelated to tensions between Mr. McGahn and Mr. Cobb.\n\nIt is not clear what a shake-up would mean for John Dowd and Jay Sekulow, the two lawyers outside the White House who have also represented Mr. Trump since the summer. Mr. Dowd has been at the center of a string of embarrassing incidents, including one in which he wrote a tweet for Mr. Trump that raised new questions about whether the president had tried to obstruct the investigation into his former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn.\n\nOne person close to the president who has urged him to dismiss Mr. Cobb and Mr. Dowd has been the Fox News personality Jeanine Pirro. Ms. Pirro, a personal friend of Mr. Trump\u2019s and a former Westchester County district attorney, told Mr. Trump in an Oval Office visit months ago that Mr. Cobb and Mr. Dowd were leading him down a path toward his demise.\n\nOther advisers have urged the president to make Marc E. Kasowitz, his longtime New York lawyer, with whom he had a falling out months ago, his lead lawyer again.

Commerce has tended to plunge, with the working class suffering lost jobs and diminished livelihoods. Alliances have been frayed, heightening international tensions.\n\nMany economists and international-relations experts assume that Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs could play out much the same way, isolating the United States while imperiling a global economic expansion.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNot least, the tariffs seem likely to present the World Trade Organization with a potentially existential crisis.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe organization has been described as the referee for global commerce, settling disputes on the basis of rules adopted by consensus among its 164 members. Now, the referee may be on the verge of losing control of the game.\n\nIn justifying its tariffs as a response to a supposed threat to national security \u2014 a contention that has drawn derision from economists \u2014 the Trump administration has virtually ensured a challenge from the European Union via a complaint filed with the trade organization. That would put the institution in a predicament in which any course risks undermining its authority.\n\nThe trade organization could rule in favor of the United States, deferring to American sovereignty and its right to determine its national security policies. But that would hand every country on earth a template to break with the norms of international trade.\n\n\u201cThis would open the floodgates to everyone bringing in broad exceptions,\u201d said Ms. Crowley, the Cambridge expert.\n\nOr the body could rule against the United States, rejecting the argument that metal forged in Europe poses a mortal peril to Americans. The Trump administration might then ignore the ruling and carry on, forcing the W.T.O. to give countries the right to retaliate.\n\nHostilities would most likely expand well beyond steel and aluminum. Mr. Trump\u2019s pledge of tariffs has enraged and astounded American allies whose fortunes are tied to producing these metals, like Japan, South Korea, Germany and Taiwan.\n\nOn Wednesday, the European Union outlined plans to retaliate with tariffs on a variety of American goods, including motorcycles, rice and bourbon. If reprisals continued, Europe might limit exports of other American agricultural products, intensifying its push against genetically modified crops. In the most extreme case, Europe might even impede American investment.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a real chance that everyone reacts very negatively,\u201d said Jennifer A.

An eye for an eye will leave us all blind and the world in deep recession.\u201d\n\nTrade frictions are a constant in the global economy. Governments wield tariffs, import quotas and other instruments to protect sensitive industries. But a trade war is different, holding the potential to damage living standards on multiple continents.\n\n\u201cYou start viewing it as a conflict between nations,\u201d said Adam S. Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a research institution in Washington. \u201cYou put a premium on doing damage rather than deterring bad behavior.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Trump and his advisers appear to be calculating that, as the largest economy on earth, the United States possesses enough muscle to dictate the terms of world trade.\n\n\u201cThey are under the delusion that the United States has been screwed by the global system that it created,\u201d Mr. Posen said. \u201cThey apparently think that everyone else will fold if they stand up.\u201d\n\nThat idea, he added, is about to be exposed as wrong.\n\nAs the United States grappled with the Great Depression, a Republican-controlled Congress seized on protectionism as the fix, adopting the infamous Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 to wall off American farms and factories from foreign competition.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe law sharply increased tariffs on hundreds of goods \u2014 from sugar to shoes to iron. American trading partners responded with their own tariffs, and commerce deteriorated, deepening the depression.\n\nAfter Democrats captured control of Congress and the White House in 1932, tariffs fell sharply, bolstering American trade. But Britain, France, Germany and other European powers maintained steep tariffs. Trade disintegrated, exacerbating nationalist animosities that exploded into World War II.\n\nThe last substantial outbreak of trade hostilities played out in the 1980s, as the United States grappled with the consequences of a rising Japan. The American auto industry \u2014 caught unprepared for the public\u2019s embrace of smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles \u2014 lobbied Washington for tariffs to limit a surge of Japanese imports. President Ronald Reagan ultimately pressured Japan to voluntarily restrict auto exports to the United States.\n\nJapanese-made automobiles sold in the United States soared in price. Seeking to avoid tariffs while improving trust, Japanese car companies began setting up plants to make their vehicles in the United States, employing American workers.\n\nTrade advisers to Mr. Trump cite this history as an example of how an aggressive stance can set up fruitful trade negotiations. But major differences separate that episode from today.\n\nBack in the 1980s, auto plants needed to be built somewhere to serve swelling American demand for small cars. Japan was firmly dependent on good relations with Washington for its security, making it prone to avoid conflict.\n\nToday\u2019s primary American trade antagonist is China, ruled by the apparent president-for-life Xi Jinping, whose nationalist credo does not leave room for caving to pressure from Washington. The world faces a glut of steel, much of it made in China. Whatever tariffs the Trump administration maintains, foreign steel manufacturers are not likely to construct new plants in the United States.\n\nAmong proponents of liberalized trade, the most hopeful history may be the most recent chapter.\n\nIn 2002, President George W. Bush put tariffs on steel to protect American producers against imports. Then, as now, companies that make products using steel vastly outnumbered those that produce the metal. As automakers and other steel buyers confronted higher costs, the tariffs eliminated some 200,000 jobs, according to one study.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nForeign steel producers filed a challenge at the W.T.O., which ruled that the United States had acted without justification. Europe prepared a list of American goods to stick with retaliatory tariffs. Mr. Bush backed down.\n\nBut if the global trading apparatus successfully defused that crisis, the current situation presents a different challenge given the nature of the commander waging the attack.\n\n\u201cThe fundamental view of this administration seems to be, somewhat bizarrely, that the United States has not benefited from trade,\u201d Ms. Crowley said. \u201cIt seems like it\u2019s not really registering how damaging this could be.\u201d", "keywords": ["states", "mr", "trade", "united", "american", "shot", "wider", "risks", "conflict", "warning", "tariffs", "trump", "trading", "igniting", "steel", "world", "trumps"], "polarity": 0.059980768822680594, "subjectivity": 0.35569929865885763},

Blood is not thicker than money for a lot of people.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, the Kushner Companies said the Trumps \u201chave zero equity of any type in our properties or businesses.\u201d In Long Branch, the statement said, \u201cwe are contemplating a third-party operator agreement with their hotel management division at market rate.\u201d Noting that it did not specialize in the hospitality industry, the company said it had \u201ca business obligation to seek the most capable resource.\u201d\n\nIn an interview, Eric Danziger, the head of Trump Hotels, disputed that teaming up with the Kushners might pose a conflict.\n\n\u201cThis is a straight-up business deal,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there were something out of the ordinary about the deal, then I think that question is fair,\u201d he said, but \u201cwe do market transactions that are reviewed and checked.\u201d\n\nMr. Danziger said that Bobby Burchfield, the Trump Organization\u2019s outside ethics adviser, had asked about the financing involved in a potential Long Branch deal with the Kushners. Mr. Burchfield, who scrutinizes how the Trump Organization\u2019s partners finance deals, among other things, often requires more information before approving a deal.\n\nWhether or not the Trumps and Kushners reach a deal, Mr. Kushner stands to gain. He is expected to eventually own 20 percent of the hotel in Pier Village, according to documents obtained through a public records request. And he was personally involved in the project early in the presidential campaign. In documents provided to Long Branch, the Kushner Companies stated that Mr. Kushner \u201cis strictly a passive investor.\u201d\n\nHe also retains a stake in a Kushner residential tower in Jersey City that bears the Trump name.\n\nIn Livingston, Mr. Kushner has divested from the Westminster Hotel, a three-story property overlooking strip malls. While it is unusual for the Trumps to manage hotels that do not carry one of their brands, Mr. Danziger said he was discussing similar deals with other companies as a way to expand the business under the \u201cright circumstances.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn owner wants to know they can depend on and rely on the operator, and we have a lot of credibility as operators,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe growing relationship between the families could be helpful to the Trumps, as the ethical restraints they voluntarily adopted after the election have proved to be a hindrance to new business. The Trump Organization, which agreed not to start any new foreign projects during the presidency, has yet to open a new hotel in the United States since Mr. Trump took office.\n\nWhile Mr. Danziger said the pipeline of potential deals was \u201cstill very active,\u201d the company has also shown some signs of scaling back: Since the election, the Trump name has been removed from properties in Manhattan, Toronto and Panama.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

If the Trumps manage a Kushner property that received foreign or domestic government funding, it could test the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clauses, which essentially prohibit the president from accepting certain gifts from foreign or domestic governments. Some legal experts argue that local bonds like the ones issued in Long Branch could brush against the domestic clause.\n\nThe Kushners, who co-own the development with Extell Development, a New York real estate firm, said they would not accept money from foreign governments.\n\nThe firm, however, has a history of seeking cash from investors with strong connections to foreign governments, including Anbang, an insurance company in China.\n\nThe Kushners also have a history of teaming up with Israeli investors, which is ethically thorny for Mr. Kushner, whose central responsibilities in the White House include handling Middle East policy. Extell\u2019s bonds have traded on the Tel Aviv stock exchange.\n\nThe Kushners also used money from Chinese investors to finance the construction of Trump Bay Street, the residential tower in Jersey City. The Chinese money came through the so-called EB-5 program, which offers visas to foreigners in exchange for $500,000 investments in real estate projects. Federal prosecutors have been investigating the Kushner businesses\u2019 use of the program, though the company has said it no longer pursues this type of funding and \u201cdid nothing improper.\u201d\n\nIn addition, investigators working for Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel looking into Russian interference in the 2016 election, have asked questions about Mr. Kushner\u2019s interactions with foreign businesspeople, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.\n\nIn Long Branch, the Kushners are moving ahead with building the hotel in Pier Village and may add more hotels in the area.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe talks with the Trumps have focused largely on the Pier Village property under construction, which might carry the Scion brand, a new line of four-star hotels the Trumps announced in 2016. The Kushner Companies, however, said on Friday that it planned only to have the Trumps manage the hotel.\n\nThe hotel construction is part of the latest phase of a decades-long effort to remake the Long Branch waterfront after a fire destroyed the boardwalk in 1987 and contributed to a downward spiral.\n\nMayor Adam Schneider and local business leaders spearheaded a redevelopment plan in the 1990s that gave rise to Pier Village. The effort increased the city\u2019s annual beachfront revenue from $200,000 in the early 1990s to more than $2 million in 2017, the mayor said.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Kushners have long owned an oceanfront house in an exclusive section of town, and in 2014, they teamed up with Extell to buy Pier Village.\n\nWith the purchase, the Kushners took over the part of Pier Village that already had a row of restaurants and shops, as well as a vacant strip of land that will eventually feature luxury residential condominiums, retail stores and the hotel.\n\nMr. Kushner was involved in planning the project. He was copied on emails with city officials, and the mayor recalls meeting with him twice.\n\nMr. Kushner assumed a role in the White House, but his sister, Nicole Meyer, and his father, Charles Kushner, continued to work on the effort, including discussions with officials about the bonds.\n\nIn September, the City Council unanimously approved the bonds to help close a \u201cfunding gap.\u201d The city will borrow the money to reimburse Kushner Companies and Extell for approved costs that arise from building public improvements such as a boardwalk, public restrooms and a children\u2019s play area.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Schneider said that the arrangement would not cause a tax increase, and that the city had struck a better deal with the Kushners and Extell than with the previous owners of Pier Village.\n\nThe city expects to more than recoup its investment by collecting an annual service charge and other payments that the Kushners and Extell pay in lieu of certain taxes. And the city said it had obtained a personal guarantee from Charles Kushner.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually a very lucrative deal to municipalities,\u201d Mr. Schneider said.\n\nA week after the city approved the bonds, emails show, Ms. Meyer invited local officials to lunch at the Beach House restaurant at Pier Village. \u201cPlease let us know if you would like to join,\u201d the invitation said, \u201cand thank you for all your support and efforts!\u201d\n\nWhen informed by reporters that the Trump Organization might ultimately be involved in a hotel in his town, Mr. Schneider, a Democrat first elected in 1990, sighed and expressed concern.\n\nBut he added: \u201cOur success is that we have a hotel that\u2019s doing a great volume of business that\u2019s creating jobs and economic vitality.

This is why everyone in the region is having the same reaction: equal parts relief and alarm.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s seemingly unstoppable series of erratic moves has helped cast China as the more stable power in Asia. But it has also diverted attention from Chinese actions that would otherwise have raised much more alarm.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cOne of the most underreported consequences of the last 18 months is that China has gotten a free pass,\u201d said Mr. Flake, citing the country\u2019s military buildup on islands in the South China Sea, its economic punishment of South Korea for cooperating with the United States on a missile defense system and, most recently, President Xi Jinping\u2019s power grab, persuading the Communist Party to abolish limits on his time in office.\n\nUnder any other American administration, \u201cthe dominant narrative would have been Chinese overreach and internal crackdowns,\u201d Mr. Flake said. \u201cBut that narrative has been completely washed away by the chaos that is Trump.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe most recent announcements out of Washington, particularly the tariffs, could hurt China.

Japan and South Korea in particular, whose relations have recently deteriorated over longstanding historical disputes, find themselves jockeying for Washington\u2019s favor.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn Japan, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has worked hard to cultivate a warm relationship with Mr. Trump. So even as Mr. Trump withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a multilateral trade deal centered in Asia, and imposed the new steel and aluminum tariffs, government officials have tempered their criticism.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cJapan and the United States are allies, so the Japanese government doesn\u2019t want to be too negative towards the Trump government,\u201d said Kazuhiro Maeshima, a professor of politics at Sophia University in Tokyo.\n\nSouth Korea, meanwhile, lobbied for an exemption to the tariffs, citing the importance of the alliance. The envoys who visited the White House to brief Mr. Trump on their meeting with Mr. Kim made personal appeals to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and the national security adviser, Gen. H.R. McMaster, on the tariff issue, according to Kim Eui-kyeom, a spokesman for President Moon Jae-in.\n\nThe tariffs prompted harsh words in some South Korean news outlets for the leader of the country\u2019s most important ally. \u201cHis style of governing, marked by disconnectedness and arrogance, is just mind-blowing,\u201d a liberal daily newspaper, Hankyoreh, said in a Saturday editorial.\n\nFor Asian allies, perhaps the most difficult task in dealing with Mr. Trump \u2014 one that is hardly unique to foreign governments \u2014 is scrambling to discern his true intentions.\n\nMr. Trump often \u201cis saying one thing in Japan and another thing in Seoul,\u201d said Yoshiki Mine, a former Japanese Foreign Ministry official who was involved in past talks between Japan and North Korea, and who now runs a think tank, the Institute of Peaceful Diplomacy.\n\nMr. Moon, after being sidelined by Washington in its approach to North Korea a few months ago, would now seem to be in favor, having effectively brokered Mr. Kim\u2019s invitation to Mr. Trump. But analysts warned that the talks could go in directions South Korea might not welcome.\n\n\u201cWe quickly get to the question of what is going to be talked about here,\u201d said Ms. Rapp-Hooper. \u201cKim Jong-un is clearly not ready to give up his nuclear weapons. If it gets to that, he will make extreme security demands, not only a security guarantee, but demanding that we end our alliance with South Korea and withdraw our troops from the peninsula.\u201d\n\nIf Mr. Trump offered to significantly reduce America\u2019s presence in South Korea in exchange for limits on the North\u2019s nuclear program, it would be a setback for South Korea and Japan and a long-term win for China.\n\nAmerican allies in the region, along with many developing countries in Southeast Asia, want the United States to maintain a strong presence, as much to counterbalance China as to promote democratic values, said Kristi Govella, an assistant professor of Asian studies at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cMost countries would prefer not to be dominated by anybody \u2014 whether it is the U.S. or China or Japan,\u201d Ms. Govella said. \u201cEspecially for the smaller countries, they want to hedge a bit and have different options, and not be subject to the will of any particular country.\u201d", "keywords": ["states", "mr", "japan", "trade", "north", "china", "united", "kim", "korea", "trump", "south", "door", "unpredictability", "trumps", "opens"], "polarity": 0.0846370726974175, "subjectivity": 0.3800292954172265},

I get it, I get it, he said.\n\nWhere others see flashing yellow lights and slow down, Mr. Trump speeds up. And just like that, in the course of 45 minutes in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump threw aside caution and dispensed with decades of convention to embark on a daring, high-wire diplomatic gambit aimed at resolving one of the world\u2019s most intractable standoffs.\n\nThe story of how this came about, assembled through interviews with officials and analysts from the United States, South Korea, Japan and China, is a case study in international relations in the Trump era. A president with no prior foreign policy experience takes on a festering conflict that has vexed the world for years with a blend of impulse and improvisation, and with no certain outcome. One moment, he is hurling playground insults and threatening nuclear war, the next he is offering the validation of a presidential meeting.\n\nWhether the high-stakes gamble ultimately pays off, no one can know. Given two unpredictable and highly combustible leaders, it seems just as likely that the meeting will never take place. If it does occur, the challenges are so steep, the gulf so wide and the history so fraught with misunderstanding, suspicion and broken promises that the prospect of an enduring resolution to the impasse seems remote.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has staked his reputation as a deal maker on the presumption that he can personally achieve what no other president has before him.\n\nA Thorny Road\n\nThe path to a possible meeting led through a thicket of hostility and feints.\n\nThroughout his first year in office, Mr. Trump ratcheted up economic sanctions while rattling his nuclear saber at \u201cLittle Rocket Man\u201d and threatening to \u201ctotally destroy North Korea.\u201d\n\nMr. Kim could match the president he called \u201cthe mentally deranged U.S. dotard\u201d bombast for bombast. In a New Year\u2019s Day speech, he said he had \u201ca nuclear button on the desk\u201d that could launch missiles capable of reaching the United States. Mr. Trump responded with a tweet saying that \u201cI too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his.\u201d\n\nBut South Korea\u2019s president, Moon Jae-in, focused on the other part of Mr. Kim\u2019s speech, when he declared that he would send athletes to the Winter Olympics, which would be held the next month in South Korea. A flurry of negotiations ensued at Panmunjom, the \u201ctruce village\u201d inside the Korean demilitarized zone, that, by the standards of inter-Korean talks, went unusually well.\n\nPhoto\n\nFor the opening ceremony, on Feb. 9, Mr. Kim sent his sister, Kim Yo-jong, while Mr. Trump sent Vice President Mike Pence. The vice president was told of a possible meeting with North Korean officials at the Games if he would tone down his message, not talk about sanctions, not meet with defectors and not bring along Fred Warmbier, whose son, Otto, an American student, died soon after being released from captivity in North Korea.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Pence opted to do all of those anyway to show resolve, and the North Koreans canceled the meeting at the last minute. Taking the hard-line position he believed the president wanted him to take, a grim-faced Mr. Pence refused to stand for the entry of the joint Korean team that included athletes from both North and South and made a point of refusing to greet Mr. Kim\u2019s sister, who was just 10 feet away.\n\nMr. Pence\u2019s failure to stand was taken as an insult to Mr. Moon and the South Korean public, undercutting the vice president\u2019s intent to show solidarity with an ally. Mr. Moon had been determined to bring the Americans and North Koreans together, to the irritation of the American delegation, which believed that he was deliberately trying to stage-manage an encounter they considered awkward and inappropriate.\n\nMr. Moon, by contrast, hosted Ms. Kim for a lavish luncheon at the presidential Blue House, and she surprised him with a letter from her brother. She told Mr. Moon that her brother wanted to convene a summit meeting at an early date. The two spent nearly three hours together, with Mr. Moon doing most of the talking.\n\nHe said that he really wanted to meet Mr. Kim and improve ties, but that there was a limit to how far he could go without progress in dismantling the North\u2019s nuclear program. He urged North Korea to talk to the Americans and said they needed to hurry so as not to lose the rare momentum from the spirit of the Olympics visits.\n\nA Family Envoy\n\nAfter the unfortunate optics from Mr. Pence\u2019s visit and what some viewed as a missed opportunity, Mr. Trump sent his daughter, Ivanka Trump, to the closing ceremony of the Games. She had dinner with Mr. Moon at the Blue House and briefed him on new sanctions her father would impose on North Korea, then made a public statement to reporters reaffirming the American strategy of \u201cmaximum pressure.\u201d\n\nShe then headed to Pyeongchang for the last two days of competition. Briefed by Mr. Pence\u2019s staff, Ms. Trump and her team were \u201cincredibly forceful,\u201d as one official put it, in going over the seating plan for the box and the timing and sequencing of arrivals to avoid any surprises.\n\nMs. Trump proffered a smiling, more open image that went over better in South Korea. She stood for the South Korean athletes, who this time entered the stadium separately from their compatriots from the North, and posed for photographs with famous Korean pop stars. But she too made a point of sending a message; for her guest in the box, she brought Gen. Vincent K. Brooks, commander of American forces in South Korea.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen she attended a curling event, Ms. Trump\u2019s team received word that the North Koreans were on their way in what the Americans thought was an effort to make a scene or prompt her to leave in an embarrassing spectacle. Ms. Trump decided to stay, and the North Koreans in the end did not come.\n\nAll Smiles in the North\n\nWith the Olympics over, it was time for Mr. Moon to make his move. Last week, he sent two trusted aides on a two-day trip to Pyongyang: Mr. Chung, his national security adviser, and Suh Hoon, his National Intelligence Service director. Flying north, they knew that they were meeting Mr. Kim but not when.\n\nAfter landing in Pyongyang, they were taken to a riverside guesthouse where they found their rooms equipped with the internet and access to foreign television channels, including CNN. They could even surf South Korean websites, a rare privilege in the totalitarian state. As soon as they unpacked, Kim Yong-chol, a general who heads inter-Korean relations, showed up and said that they were meeting Mr. Kim that evening.\n\nBlack limousines took the South Koreans to Azalea Hall in the ruling Workers\u2019 Party headquarters, Mr. Kim\u2019s workplace. They found Mr. Kim and his sister waiting to greet them with broad smiles. Mr. Chung and Mr. Suh were the first South Koreans to set foot inside the party headquarters since the Korean War.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Chung had barely launched into his talking points when Mr. Kim said \u201cI know\u201d and \u201cI understand you.\u201d Then he laid out his proposal: talks with the United States on denuclearizing his country; a suspension of nuclear and missile tests during the talks; and his understanding that the United States and South Korea must proceed with annual joint military exercises.\n\nThe South Koreans found Mr. Kim to be an extremely confident leader. He was closely following foreign news media, knew how he was depicted, and even joked about it. He had studied Mr. Moon\u2019s speeches and overtures toward the North.\n\nHe even joked about his missile launches. \u201cI was sorry to hear that President Moon Jae-in had to convene his National Security Council meetings early in the morning because of our missile launchings,\u201d he told the South Koreans. \u201cNow, he won\u2019t lose his early morning sleep any more.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The South Koreans suggested Pyongyang, Seoul and Panmunjom as possible sites and asked Mr. Kim to choose. Mr. Kim said he would come to the Peace House, a South Korean building inside Panmunjom.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe meeting and dinner, complete with wines and traditional Korean liquor, lasted from 6 p.m. to 10:12 p.m. with much laughter and bonhomie.\n\nAfter returning to Seoul on Tuesday, the South Korean officials briefed Mr. Moon and then South Korean reporters. After his news conference, Mr. Chung called General McMaster and told him that he was carrying a message from Mr. Kim to Mr. Trump. Only several people at the Blue House knew that the message included a proposal for a meeting with Mr. Trump.\n\nOff to Washington\n\nMr. Chung and Mr. Suh flew to Washington, arriving Thursday morning. By the afternoon, they were at the White House, meeting separately with General McMaster and Gina Haspel, the deputy C.I.A. director. The four then got together and were soon joined by other American officials, including Mr. Pence, Mr. Mattis, Dan Coats, the national intelligence director, Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman, and John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff.\n\nJoined by their ambassador to Washington, the South Korean visitors were not supposed to meet with Mr. Trump until Friday, but when he heard they were in the building, he called them to the Oval Office.\n\nMr. Kim\u2019s invitation to meet was not a complete surprise to Mr. Trump\u2019s team. An American official said they had learned about it from intelligence agencies, so on Thursday morning, before the arrival of the South Koreans, Mr. Trump talked by phone with Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, who was traveling in Africa, about the possibility. What he did not tell Mr. Tillerson was that he would accept.\n\nMr. Trump was eager enough, however, that once he said yes, they discussed a meeting as early as next month. The South Koreans suggested it would be better to wait until after Mr. Moon\u2019s summit meeting with Mr. Kim in April, which led to a target of May.\n\nNot only did Mr. Trump surprise the South Koreans by accepting immediately, he even suggested that they make the public announcement right there and then at the White House.\n\nPhoto\n\nA stunned Mr. Chung retreated to General McMaster\u2019s office to draft a statement in collaboration with the Americans. Then, using a secure telephone line, he called Mr. Moon early in the morning in Seoul to get his approval.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nElated, Mr. Trump stuck his head into the White House briefing room to tell reporters there would be an important announcement soon, something he had never done before.\n\nSome of the president\u2019s advisers objected to the idea of a foreign official making a statement from the White House lectern, so they had him do it instead on the White House driveway, where visitors typically speak with reporters. Still, it was highly unusual for a foreign official to announce an American president\u2019s decision in a major international situation.\n\nOut of the Loop\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s quick decision caught many off guard, including Mr. Tillerson and American allies. Television networks set up live feeds from the White House driveway to carry Mr. Chung\u2019s announcement. Congressional leaders and top officials at the Pentagon and the State Department learned what was happening from news reports.\n\nThe fact that it came on the same day that the president slapped stiff new tariffs on imported steel that would hit South Korea and Japan hard indicated how hasty and unplanned it was.\n\nWhile Mr. Chung headed to the driveway, Mr. Trump hurriedly called Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan to let him know. Mr. Abe has worked assiduously to cultivate a close relationship with Mr. Trump and taken a hard line on North Korea, but he was left out of the loop, a fact that stung.\n\n\u201cI have an impression that the Japanese are not quite well informed,\u201d said Yoshiki Mine, head of a previous Japanese delegation seeking normalized relations with North Korea. \u201cWhat we have been told is awfully out of tune, I should say.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump did not reach President Xi Jinping of China until the next morning. China has backed Mr. Trump on North Korea, generating good will between Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi. But China refused last month to go along with an American plan to interdict oil tankers bound for North Korea on the high seas, demonstrating that there were limits to how far China would go in punishing Mr. Kim, given the risk of a North Korean collapse on its borders.\n\nMr. Trump said his conversation with Mr. Xi went well. \u201cPresident XI told me he appreciates that the U.S. is working to solve the problem diplomatically rather than going with the ominous alternative,\u201d the president wrote on Twitter on Saturday. \u201cChina continues to be helpful!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut in response to Mr. Trump\u2019s planned meeting, China is engaged in what some call \u201cexclusion anxiety,\u201d worried about being shut out. China would like the meeting to be held in Beijing, where six-nation talks were held with North Korea during President George W. Bush\u2019s administration, but Chinese analysts doubt Mr. Kim would agree.\n\nFor now, Mr. Trump is juggling these dynamics and preparing to meet the world\u2019s most hermetic leader.

The United States is also engaged in difficult negotiations with Mexico and Canada over changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement.\n\nIn Colombia, Mr. Trump will be repaying a visit Mr. Santos, a Harvard-trained economist who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2016 for negotiating a peace treaty with FARC guerrillas, made to the White House in May. At a news conference with Mr. Trump at the time, Mr. Santos sidestepped a question about whether he agreed with the White House\u2019s plan to build a wall on the border with Mexico to halt the flow of drugs into the United States.\n\nEarlier, Mr. Trump had said that coca cultivation and cocaine production had risen to record levels in Colombia, and challenged Mr. Santos to remedy the problem. The United States has a long history of cooperation with Colombia on that issue and others.\n\nThe efforts to build the border wall, along with the president\u2019s move in recent days to establish tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, have inflamed some of the leaders with whom he will meet in Peru. After vocal protests from Mexico and Canada, Mr. Trump granted those countries a temporary exemption from the tariffs. But Brazil, a major steel exporter to the United States, has not been given any such exemption.\n\nAmerican presidents have attended the Western Hemisphere meeting, known as the Summit of the Americas, in previous years \u2014 Barack Obama made history there in 2015 by meeting with President Ra\u00fal Castro of Cuba \u2014 but few have stoked as much indignation as Mr. Trump.\n\nAt least twice during Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency, efforts to set up a meeting between him and President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto of Mexico have been scotched over their bitter disagreement about the plan for the border wall.\n\nOrder Reprints | Today\u2019s Paper | Subscribe A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A 21 of the New York edition with the headline: Trump to Make First Visit as President to Latin America\n\n\n\n\n\n", "keywords": ["white", "mexico", "mr", "states", "trade", "united", "santos", "visit", "trump", "latin", "president", "america"], "polarity": 0.10005570409982174, "subjectivity": 0.32600267379679143},

Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times The Man Who Knew Too Little The most ignorant man in America knows that Donald Trump is president \u2014 but that\u2019s about it. Living a liberal fantasy is complicated. Erik Hagerman heads out for his morning ritual, a 30-minute drive into town for coffee and a scone at his favorite coffee shop in Athens, Ohio.CreditDamon Winter/The New York Times\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGLOUSTER, Ohio \u2014 At first, the experiment didn\u2019t have a name.\n\nRight after the election, Erik Hagerman decided he\u2019d take a break from reading about the hoopla of politics.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s victory shook him. Badly. And so Mr. Hagerman developed his own eccentric experiment, one that was part silent protest, part coping mechanism, part extreme self-care plan.\n\nHe swore that he would avoid learning about anything that happened to America after Nov. 8, 2016.\n\n\u201cIt was draconian and complete,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I wanted to just steer away from Trump or shift the conversation. It was like I was a vampire and any photon of Trump would turn me to dust.\u201d\n\nIt was just going to be for a few days. But he is now more than a year into knowing almost nothing about American politics. He has managed to become shockingly uninformed during one of the most eventful chapters in modern American history. He is as ignorant as a contemporary citizen could ever hope to be.\n\nJames Comey. Russia. Robert Mueller. Las Vegas. The travel ban. \u201cAlternative facts.\u201d Pussy hats. Scaramucci. Parkland. Big nuclear buttons. Roy Moore.\n\nHe knows none of it. To Mr. Hagerman, life is a spoiler.\n\n\u201cI just look at the weather,\u201d said Mr. Hagerman, 53, who lives alone on a pig farm in southeastern Ohio. \u201cBut it\u2019s only so diverting.\u201d\n\nHe says he has gotten used to a feeling that he hasn\u2019t experienced in a long time. \u201cI am bored,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not bugging me.\u201d\n\nImage Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times\n\nIt takes meticulous planning to find boredom. Mr. Hagerman commits as hard as a method actor, and his self-imposed regimen \u2014 white-noise tapes at the coffee shop, awkward scolding of friends, a ban on social media \u2014 has reshaped much of his life.\n\nExtreme as it is, it\u2019s a path that likely holds some appeal for liberals these days \u2014 a D.I.Y. version of moving to Canada.\n\nDemocrats, liberals and leftists have coped with this first year of the Trump presidency in lots of ways. Some subsist on the thin gruel of political cartoon shows and online impeachment petitions. Others dwell online in the thrilling place where conspiracy is indistinguishable from truth. Others have been inspired to action, making their first run for public office, taking local action or marching in their first protest rally.\n\nMr. Hagerman has done the opposite of all of them.\n\nThe fact that it\u2019s working for him \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m emotionally healthier than I\u2019ve ever felt,\u201d he said \u2014 has made him question the very value of being fed each day by the media. Why do we bother tracking faraway political developments and distant campaign speeches? What good comes of it? Why do we read all these tweets anyway?\n\n\u201cI had been paying attention to the news for decades,\u201d Mr. Hagerman said. \u201cAnd I never did anything with it.\u201d\n\nAt some point last year, he decided his experiment needed a name. He considered The Embargo, but it sounded too temporary. The Boycott? It came off a little whiny.\n\nMr. Hagerman has created a fortress around himself. \u201cTiny little boats of information can be dangerous,\u201d he said.\n\nHe decided that it would be called The Blockade.\n\nBehind the Blockade\n\nFor a guy who has gone to great lengths to essentially plug his ears, Mr. Hagerman sure does talk a lot. He is witty and discursive, punctuating his stories with wild-eyed grins, exaggerated grimaces and more than the occasional lost thread.\n\nI recently spent two days visiting his farm on the condition that I not bring news from the outside world. As the sun set over his porch, turning the rolling hills pink then purple then blue, he held forth, jumping from English architecture to the local pigs\u2019 eating habits to his mother\u2019s favorite basketball team to the philosophy of Kant. He can go days without seeing another soul.\n\nThis life is still fairly new. Just a few years ago, he was a corporate executive at Nike (senior director of global digital commerce was his official, unwieldy title) working with teams of engineers to streamline the online shopping experience. Before that, he had worked digital jobs at Walmart and Disney.\n\n\u201cI worked 12-, 14-hour days,\u201d he said. \u201cThe calendar completely booked.\u201d\n\nBut three years ago, he decided he had saved enough money to move to a farm, make elliptical sculptures \u2014 and, eventually, opt out of the national conversation entirely.\n\nHe lives alone and has never been married. As for money, a financial adviser in San Francisco manages his investments. Mr. Hagerman says he throws away the quarterly updates without reviewing them.\n\nMr. Hagerman grew up in southeastern Ohio, and after years spent in Brooklyn warehouses, San Francisco tech bubbles and Nike-land in Portland, Ore., the idea of a quiet life became more and more appealing. His mother lives nearby; he sees her a lot since he moved back in 2015. She reluctantly adheres to The Blockade, although they do discuss the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nImage Mr. Hagerman drives from his home into Athens for his morning rituals.

Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times\n\nMr. Hagerman begins every day with a 30-minute drive to Athens, the closest city of note, to get a cup of coffee \u2014 a triple-shot latte with whole milk. He goes early, before most customers have settled into the oversize chairs to scroll through their phones. To make sure he doesn\u2019t overhear idle chatter, he often listens to white noise through his headphones. (He used to listen to music, \u201cbut stray conversation can creep in between songs.\u201d)\n\nAt Donkey Coffee, everyone knows his order, and they know about The Blockade. \u201cOur baristas know where he\u2019s at so they don\u2019t engage him on topics that would make him uncomfortable,\u201d said Angie Pyle, the coffee shop\u2019s co-owner.\n\nMr. Hagerman has also trained his friends. A close friend from his Nike days, Parinaz Vahabzadeh, didn\u2019t think he was quite serious at first and, in the early days of The Blockade, kept dropping little hints about politics.\n\nThe new administration compelled her to engage more deeply in politics, not less. She had only recently become a United States citizen, and she was passionate about the immigration debate. She did not let Mr. Hagerman opt out easily. \u201cI was needling him,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd in response, she received, for the first time, a stern text message. \u201cI\u2019m now officially cross with you,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAs you know very well I don\u2019t wish to hear about current events. I know you don\u2019t agree with my wishes but I do expect you to respect them.\u201d\n\nThey now speak on the phone several times a week, but never about the news. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten used to it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s actually nice to not talk about politics.\u201d\n\nConversations with Mr. Hagerman can have a Rip Van Winkle quality. He spoke several times about his sister, Bonnie, an assistant professor, who lives in, of all places, Charlottesville, Va.\n\nWhile he and I were talking, I looked over at him at every mention of Charlottesville to see if the name of the city, home to perhaps the ugliest weekend of the Trump era to date, made him flinch.\n\n\u201cSo, do you associate Charlottesville\u201d \u2014 I would say the name deliberately and with emphasis \u2014 \u201cwith anything besides your sister?\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t bite. I think he really didn\u2019t know about the Nazis.\n\nLater, he pointed to a house on a hill and said that before the election, the neighbor had decorated his lawn with an effigy of Hillary Clinton behind bars. I wanted to point out that the recently unveiled Mueller indictment found that a Russian troll had paid for a Hillary impersonator at a Florida rally. But I bit my tongue \u2014 Mr. Hagerman didn\u2019t know about Mueller, or Russia, or trolls.\n\nImage Above Mr. Hagerman's bed is an art piece from a series he is currently working on at his home.

Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times\n\nLast winter, Mr. Hagerman spent several weeks visiting his twin brother, a tech C.E.O., in San Francisco. Strict arrangements had to be made \u2014 the Sunday newspaper kept out of sight, the TV switched off, his teenage niece and nephew under special instructions.\n\n\u201cThe bigger challenge was when we would have friends come over and visit,\u201d said his brother, Kris. \u201cWe had to have Erik not be there, or we would give them a heads up that Erik has this news blockade going and we gave them the guidelines.\n\n\u201cThey were always a little bemused by it. And to some extent a little envious,\u201d he said. \u201cThe prospect of just chucking all that for a period of time felt somewhat appealing.\u201d\n\nTo be fair, Mr. Hagerman has made a few concessions. He reads The New Yorker\u2019s art reviews, but is careful to flip past the illustrated covers, which often double as political commentary. He watches every Cavaliers game, but only on mute.\n\nHe counts a few boats that have sailed past The Blockade. He saw a picture of Kim Jong-un on a newspaper at the coffee shop, signaling that something was up with North Korea. And he overheard someone saying something about Obamacare, which meant health care was back in the news. His brother alerted him to the Equifax breach for his own protection.\n\n\u201cBut the blockade has been pretty damn effective,\u201d Mr. Hagerman said.\n\nHe said that with some pride, but he has the misgivings about disengaging from political life that you have, by now, surely been shouting at him as you read. \u201cThe first several months of this thing, I didn\u2019t feel all that great about it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes me a crappy citizen. It\u2019s the ostrich head-in-the-sand approach to political outcomes you disagree with.\u201d\n\nIt seems obvious to say, but to avoid current affairs is in some ways a luxury that many people, like, for example, immigrants worried about deportation, cannot afford.\n\n\u201cHe has the privilege of constructing a world in which very little of what he doesn\u2019t have to deal with gets through,\u201d said his sister, Bonnie Hagerman. \u201cThat\u2019s a privilege. We all would like to construct our dream worlds. Erik is just more able to do it than others.\u201d\n\nWhat if, he began to think, he could address his privilege, and the idea of broader good, near to home?\n\nHe has a master project, one that he thinks about obsessively, that he believes can serve as his contribution to American society.\n\nHe calls it The Lake.\n\nAt the Lake\n\nOn a recent spookily warm day, Mr. Hagerman clambered up a steep bank of woods, pushing past vines and stepping past fallen logs.\n\nWide-eyed, giddy with excitement, he led the way to a flat stretch of brush where he spread his arms and began talking even faster than usual. \u201cThis is where we\u2019ll build a giant barn. It will feel like a cathedral. The cloister will be here,\u201d he said, making reference to Chartres, and Oxford, and the grandeur of medieval cathedrals.\n\nAbout nine months ago, he bought some 45 acres of land on the site of a former strip mine. The property, untouched for decades, has been reclaimed by nature \u2014 deer, beavers, salamanders and canopies of majestic trees are thriving.\n\nWe walked further to the edge of a steep drop-off. Below, a bright blue lake shimmered in the February heat like a secret. He\u2019ll debate as long as you want whether the body of water counts as a lake or a pond. It\u2019s easier if you just agree it\u2019s a lake.\n\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe how great it feels to go swimming there,\u201d he said. He added, with almost rapturous glee, that the lake sits in the spot where the mining company dug deepest.\n\nImage Mr. Hagerman chats with Gary Conley, left, a landscape ecologist working with him to conserve wetland habitats on his property outside Athens. Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times\n\nImage Mr. Conley holds a juvenile salamander from a vernal pool. Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times\n\nMr. Hagerman sees this land as his life\u2019s work. He plans to restore it, protect it, live on it and then preserve it for the public. \u201cI will never sell this land,\u201d he said.\n\nHe wouldn\u2019t put it exactly this way, but he talks about the land in part as penance for the moral cost of his Blockade. He has come to believe that being a news consumer doesn\u2019t enhance society. He also believes that restoring a former coal mine and giving it to the future does.\n\n\u201cI see it as a contribution that has civic relevance that aligns with my passions and what I do well,\u201d Mr. Hagerman said. \u201cI\u2019m going to donate it. It\u2019s going to take most of my net worth. That\u2019s what I\u2019m going to spend the rest of my money on.\u201d\n\nHe has filled an entire room of his house with a 3-D rendering of the property to better envision his plans. He has hired Gary Conley, a local landscape ecologist, to advise on the project. Mr. Conley, a gentle bearded outdoorsman who can speak at length about the preferences of the local amphibians, believes that the land could become something special.\n\nMr. Conley indulges Mr. Hagerman\u2019s fantasies for the land \u2014 a walkway modeled on an ancient Mayan ballgame! Land art inspired by \u201cSpiral Jetty\u201d! Windows and concrete blocks, so many blocks! \u2014 but Mr. Conley mainly serves as the straight man to inject ecological reality into the plan.\n\nMr. Conley respects The Blockade. After all, the project of The Lake might not exist without it.\n\nImage Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times\n\nIn those carefree pre-Trump days, Mr. Hagerman would settle into the coffee shop with his newspaper and dig in. But after The Blockade, he could only read the weather \u2014 \u201cFor elderly men it\u2019s endlessly interesting\u201d \u2014 and the real estate listings.\n\nIt was during one of those long boring mornings, with no news to read, that he found the listing for The Lake.\n\n\u201cThe first time I saw it, I said, \u2018This is it,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nOrder Reprints | Today\u2019s Paper | Subscribe A version of this article appears in print on , on Page ST 1 of the New York edition with the headline: The Man Who Knew Too Little\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "keywords": ["coffee", "days", "mr", "man", "knew", "hagerman", "credit", "blockade", "winterthe", "damon", "little", "york"], "polarity": 0.08558744916699461, "subjectivity": 0.41289802369347806},

Credit Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 After spending much of her life fighting for state and local control of education, Betsy DeVos last year found herself at the helm of the federal agency that she had long said stands in the way of educational innovation.\n\nBut after a year on the job, Ms. DeVos may have learned a hard lesson: local control means she can\u2019t always get what she wants.\n\nMs. DeVos this week upbraided state education chiefs, telling them that while she was obligated to approve their federally mandated state education plans, she was not happy about the way they have used their freedom under the new federal law that governs elementary and secondary education, known as the Every Student Succeeds Act.\n\nIf the states are supposed to be the laboratories of democracy, Ms. DeVos isn\u2019t seeing much experimentation. But she refuses to violate her principles on states\u2019 rights and tell them what to do.\n\n\u201cESSA was enacted partially in response to the widespread calls from state school chiefs \u2014 including many in this room \u2014 to give you the flexibility and opportunity to address your state\u2019s unique challenges,\u201d Ms. DeVos said in an address to the Council of Chief State School Officers. \u201cWell, this law gives you that chance. The trouble, I don\u2019t see much evidence that you\u2019ve yet seized it.\u201d\n\nIt was the first time that Ms. DeVos has offered her opinions on the quality of state plans under the new law, which freed states from the punitive and prescriptive federal mandates of the George W. Bush-era No Child Left Behind Act.\n\nBut what Ms. DeVos called \u201ctough love\u201d policy experts and observers called the ultimate display of a frustrated federalist. The address, they said, is an example of a self-described education reformer wrestling with the limits of her influence in an agency whose power she wants to curtail.\n\n\u201cI think she\u2019s having an identity problem,\u201d said Sandy Kress, who served as senior education adviser to Mr. Bush on the No Child Left Behind Act.\n\nMr. Kress noted that Ms. DeVos had been critical of her predecessors, calling Mr. Bush\u2019s education law a \u201cstick,\u201d and Barack Obama\u2019s Race to the Top policy, which incentivized state reform with cash, a \u201ccarrot.\u201d But he noted that she had not identified any tool that she would use to effect change in the nation\u2019s schools.\n\n\u201cBeing a federalist does not exclude you from the role of leadership,\u201d Mr. Kress said. \u201cShe needs to stand for something, rather than showing up at a place like a regular citizen opining on things.\u201d\n\nMichael J. Petrilli, president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, said he believed that not since the administration of the elder George Bush has an education secretary been a true federalist. That education secretary was Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, who is now a senator. As the chief architect of ESSA, he ensured the \u201clocal control\u201d components of the bill.\n\nGeorge W. Bush\u2019s administration was so aggressive in driving education policy that Mr. Bush reset the expectation of conservative leadership in the department, Mr. Petrilli said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been conditioned for the last 30 years to expect a secretary of education to be out front on education reform, using various federal levers,\u201d he said. \u201cBetsy DeVos is trying to lead from behind.\u201d\n\nMs. DeVos\u2019s criticism of the state plans echoed that of several groups that say her office\u2019s implementation of ESSA has been too lax.\n\nDemocrats and civil rights groups say Ms. DeVos has approved state education plans that do not properly measure the performance of minority students, an allegation she denies. But in her speech, she mentioned the fact that several governors, the majority of them Republican, had refused to sign the plans their states submitted to her office because of what they saw as lackluster achievement goals.\n\n\u201cJust because a plan complies with the law doesn\u2019t mean it does what\u2019s best for students,\u201d Ms. DeVos told the chiefs. \u201cWhatever the reasons, I see too many plans that only meet the bare minimum required by the law. Sure, they may pass muster around conference tables in Washington, but the bare minimum won\u2019t pass muster around kitchen tables.\u201d\n\nEducation chiefs bristled at Ms. DeVos\u2019s assessments, which they saw as painting them with too broad a brush.\n\n\u201cAll states are doing far more than Sec. DeVos recognized,\u201d tweeted Matthew Blomstedt, the education commissioner in Nebraska, a state whose governor refused to sign its ESSA plan. \u201cShe delivered a \u2018tough love\u2019 speech that demonstrated why the USDOE is out of touch with the good things actually happening in states and schools.\u201d\n\nPolicy experts agreed with the substance of the speech, but said it was too little, too late.\n\n\u201cShe should look in the mirror,\u201d said Chad Aldeman, a principal at Bellwether Education Partners, a consulting firm that led a group of policy experts in an independent review of plans last year. \u201cThere were several points in time she could have shared her concerns and improved plans.\u201d\n\nAll plans have been submitted, and 35 have been approved. In announcing the batches of approvals, Ms. DeVos noted only that they complied with the law.\n\nMs. DeVos had signaled unwavering support for the autonomy under the ESSA law, and even issued a pared-down template for states to complete following a vote by Congress last year to rescind regulations that specified accountability measures in the law. But since then, she has not used much of her power over budgets, guidance documents or even a public relations campaign to promote opportunities for innovation and specificity under ESSA, critics say.\n\n\u201cShe lowered the bar, they met it, and now she seems frustrated by that,\u201d Mr. Aldeman said.\n\nMs. DeVos told state chiefs that they met the lowest bar \u2014 compliance \u2014 and that many plans fell short of furthering ESSA\u2019s primary goals of innovation in educational programming to lift student achievement, as well as increasing transparency about school performance.\n\nFor example, she said, only two states, Louisiana and New Mexico, opted into a program that allowed them to use millions in otherwise restricted federal dollars to provide new educational programs, like online courses, for struggling schools.\n\nShe also said that some states \u201cproposed accountability schemes that were so complicated, schools would be accountable to no one.\u201d In one case, she said, a state \u201ctook a simple concept like a color-coded dashboard and managed to make it nearly indecipherable.\u201d\n\nIn her speech, Ms. DeVos praised \u201cbright spots,\u201d like Nevada, whose state education chief, Steve Canavero, said he was encouraged by the speech.\n\n\u201cThe core message I heard is a message that I continue to hear from the other folks who are in the bleachers of the education space: You have to continually think about ways to innovate, and think about ways to best serve kids,\u201d Mr. Canavero said.\n\nMs. DeVos reiterated that she would not fall into \u201cthe trap of a top-down approach\u201d of her predecessors.\n\n\u201cThe Department of Education doesn\u2019t write laws, it implements them,\u201d she said. \u201cCongress did its job. We\u2019re doing ours. And now, you get to do yours.\u201d\n\nOrder Reprints | Today\u2019s Paper | Subscribe A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A 15 of the New York edition with the headline: DeVos Discovers Scope of States\u2019 Rights\n\n\n\n\n\n", "keywords": ["control", "states", "mr", "state", "finds", "chiefs", "devos", "education", "ms", "limits", "local", "demanding", "plans", "influence", "law", "speech"], "polarity": 0.06522843376291654, "subjectivity": 0.4151802539733574},

Having built its North Korea policy on sanctions and threats of military action, the administration must now learn the language of engagement.\n\nIt also served as a reminder of how many hurdles lie ahead before Mr. Trump\u2019s spontaneous decision on Thursday afternoon leads to a meticulously staged meeting between the American president and the dictator who rules the world\u2019s most reclusive country.\n\n\u201cNorth Korean offers typically come with caveats and asterisks that need to be examined,\u201d said Daniel R. Russel, a former Asia adviser to President Barack Obama. \u201cWe all hope that the multiyear pressure campaign has had an effect, but we shouldn\u2019t prematurely celebrate.\u201d\n\nAt the State Department, where some diplomats quietly applauded Mr. Trump\u2019s gamble, there was a fear that more hawkish aides in the White House might throw up further hurdles to the meeting. The White House, they said, has invested more in sanctions and military options than in diplomacy. Officials there have in the past expressed frustration about what they viewed as the Pentagon\u2019s reluctance to provide options for a military strike on the North.\n\nWith all the potential traps and internal misgivings, some officials said they believed the chances of a meeting between the two leaders actually happening were less than 50 percent.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s decision stunned allies and his own advisers, not least Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, who was caught unaware while traveling in Africa when the president accepted Mr. Kim\u2019s invitation.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Tillerson\u2019s lack of involvement in the announcement underscored how marginalized the State Department has become in North Korea policy. The department\u2019s chief negotiator on the North, Joseph Yun, resigned from the Foreign Service last week.\n\nOther State Department officials insisted that Mr. Tillerson had not been singled out; Mr. Trump blindsided all of his advisers. And the secretary, speaking to reporters in Djibouti, argued that Mr. Trump\u2019s decision was not the bolt from the blue that it seemed.\n\n\u201cThis is something that he\u2019s had on his mind for quite some time, so it was not a surprise in any way,\u201d Mr. Tillerson said. \u201cHe\u2019s expressed it openly before about his willingness to meet with Kim Jong-un.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Gen. H. R. McMaster \u2014 expressed concerns about a meeting, according to a senior official. But nobody vocally opposed it.\n\nMr. Trump also had to mollify a rattled ally, Japan, which got no advance notice of his decision. In a call, the president reassured Prime Minister Shinzo Abe that the United States would not ease its pressure campaign on North Korea. Mr. Abe, officials said, asked for a meeting with him.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s call on Friday morning with President Xi Jinping of China was more relaxed. The Chinese have long called for direct talks between the United States and North Korea. American officials said they expected that Mr. Xi would offer Beijing as a venue for the meeting.\n\nThe location is one of a number of unresolved issues, including the size and composition of the delegations and the agenda. Some officials said Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim would set a broad framework for the talks, and leave the actual negotiating to subsequent sessions with lower-level officials. Even the logistical issues might require a couple of preliminary meetings, they said.\n\nStill, the lack of direct communication between Pyongyang and Washington was a yellow light to some experts. The two countries communicate through independent channels, one of which \u2014 the \u201cNew York Channel\u201d \u2014 goes through North Korea\u2019s mission to the United Nations.\n\nIn recent months, these channels have been used mostly for communications about Americans detained in North Korea. Mr. Yun, the former State Department negotiator, used such a channel to negotiate the return of Otto F. Warmbier, the college student from Cincinnati who suffered an irreversible brain injury while held in prison in Pyongyang.\n\nAt some point, officials said, they expected North Korea to send a message about the Trump-Kim meeting through one of the channels. The administration will parse it carefully to assess if it aligns with the message brought to Washington by the South Korean envoys.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s president, Moon Jae-in, has tried tirelessly to broker a meeting between American and North Korean officials. He sent his envoys \u2014 Chung Eui-yong, the national security adviser, and Suh Hoon, the director of the intelligence service \u2014 to the White House almost immediately after they returned from their meeting with Mr. Kim in Pyongyang.\n\nThe message from the envoys, American officials said, was that the economic sanctions had really crippled the North.

Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, have promised a raft of new measures to address the problem.\n\nPhoto\n\nAlbany has a checkered record when it comes to sexual harassment, on both sides of the aisle, perhaps most notably of the disgraced Democratic power broker, Assemblyman Vito J. Lopez. Mr. Lopez was accused in 2012 of sexually harassing several female staff members, graphic incidents, including groping, which later led to his resignation.\n\nIn 2014, a Buffalo-area assemblyman, Dennis H. Gabryszak, a Democrat, stepped down amid accusations that he sexually harassed several female staff members. In 2016, Angela M. Wozniak, a first-term Republican from western New York, was censured after an affair with a male staffer; she did not seek re-election.\n\nAnd as recently as last fall, the former Assemblyman Steven T. McLaughlin, an outspoken Republican, was disciplined for asking a female staff member to send him naked pictures of herself.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDuring the Lopez scandal, Sheldon Silver, then the speaker of the Assembly, was also harshly criticized for authorizing secret financial settlements to harassment victims. Such payments are now the subject of proposals from both Mr. Cuomo and Senate Republicans, who introduced a bill last week that would outlaw such confidential settlements, echoing a similar push by Senate Democrats in January.\n\nThe Assembly has already passed internal rules banning confidential settlements, and has made other reforms, including the mandatory reporting of any sexual harassment complaint. It, too, is expected to introduce legislation confronting sexual harassment on Monday, after establishing a work group of members last month to study the issue.\n\nThe seeming commonality of purpose greatly increases the likelihood of a deal on the issue, even if the question of who will be doing the negotiating remains unsettled.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Heastie, the Assembly speaker \u2014 has expanded to include Senator Jeffrey D. Klein, the leader of the eight-member Independent Democratic Conference, a breakaway cadre of Democrats who collaborate with Mr. Flanagan to help rule the Senate.\n\nIn February, the governor\u2019s office indicated that Senator Andrea Stewart-Cousins, the leader of the minority Democratic conference, would be part of negotiations, something she has asked to do. But on Friday, Mr. Cuomo\u2019s office would not explicitly say that Ms. Stewart-Cousins would actually be in the negotiation room during talks among the four men; rather, they said she would \u201cbe included,\u201d without clarifying what that means.\n\nPotentially further muddying negotiations is the situation surrounding Mr. Klein, who himself has been accused of forcibly kissing a former staffer in 2015. Mr. Klein denies that accusation, and his political partner in the Senate, Mr. Flanagan, has declined to investigate, saying that the accuser, Erica Vladimer, did not make a formal complaint. (Mr. Klein has since asked for a formal investigation from a state ethics panel.),\n\nMr. Flanagan was also criticized for approving a new sexual harassment policy that added an admonition to false accusers, which led some Albany observers to question whether the Legislature\u2019s heart was behind the measures.\n\n\u201cProcess is as important as outcome,\u201d said Alexis Grenell, a public affairs consultant and writer who once worked in state government. She added that the governor and others should include experts in sexual harassment and those who have reported being harassed, and even those who have been harassed and not reported it for fear of retaliation. \u201cAn all-male decision-making body is conflicted out of arriving at a meaningful solution,\u201d she said.\n\nIndeed, even the governor has been accused of talking in a patronizing manner in December to a female reporter in Albany. The reporter, Karen DeWitt, asked Mr. Cuomo a question about sexual harassment in state government; the governor shot back that she was doing \u201ca disservice to women\u201d by limiting the question\u2019s scope to Albany.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe state Democratic Party, controlled by Mr. Cuomo, started a campaign on Wednesday to pass Mr. Cuomo\u2019s so-called Women\u2019s Agenda, quoting the governor as saying \u201c2018 will be the year for action against the culture of rampant sexism and misogyny.\u201d\n\nMs. Simon, who represents parts of Brooklyn, said that \u201cthere is almost no woman I know who has not been treated differently, and treated badly.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlbany is no different from the rest of the world,\u201d she added. \u201cNot that long ago we were chattel.\u201d\n\nMs. Paulin plans to introduce legislation to require a survey every two years \u2014 coinciding with when a new Legislature is seated \u2014 to \u201cmeasure the legislative workplace climate as it relates to discrimination and harassment procedure.\u201d The letter itself asks the state to convene a task force \u201cto examine the pervasiveness of the problem of sexual harassment\u201d in New York workplaces, and \u201cevaluate the effectiveness of current policies and laws.\u201d\n\nAs for the incidents she said she had personally witnessed, she said she was uncomfortable about naming names.\n\n\u201cThis should not be about individuals but about the entire systemic change we need,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd while those signing are not necessarily alleging misbehavior in their current workplaces in Albany, the letter\u2019s final line might well serve as a notice for the state\u2019s policymakers, Ms. Paulin said.\n\n\u201cOur work,\u201d it reads, \u201chas just begun.\u201d", "keywords": ["mr", "staff", "state", "letter", "shadows", "behavior", "cuomo", "york", "bad", "members", "senate", "sexual", "bipartisan", "harassment", "tackling"], "polarity": 0.08447454576486833, "subjectivity": 0.4381770857577307},

Smith, Pew\u2019s associate director of research, who also noted a nine-point drop among evangelical men. \u201cBoth groups have become less approving over time.\u201d\n\nIf that drop in support translates into a lack of enthusiasm among core Trump supporters in the midterm elections in November, as it did for many of President Barack Obama\u2019s voters in 2010, the Republican Party could be more vulnerable in its efforts to maintain control of Congress. In 2020, it would also possibly open a lane for a primary challenger to the president.\n\nThe women in suburban Dallas all conceded they have cringed sometimes at Mr. Trump, citing his pettiness, impulsiveness, profanity and name calling. Still, they defended him because he delivered on issues they cared most about, such as the appointment of Justice Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cCertainly we are all embarrassed, but for the most part he represents what we stand for,\u201d said Ms. Leonhart, who is active in the women\u2019s ministry at her church.\n\nA clear majority of white evangelical women, even in the face of the #MeToo movement and renewed claims of marital infidelity against the president, continue, along with white evangelical men, to form Mr. Trump\u2019s most cohesive block of support.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s ability to connect so strongly with evangelical voters was among the most notable surprises of the 2016 campaign. Since his election, he has courted evangelical leaders aggressively and, more important, has delivered on promises to appoint conservatives like Justice Gorsuch to federal courts. Men who see themselves as leaders of religious conservatives, such as Franklin Graham, Jerry Falwell Jr. and Tony Perkins, the president of the Family Research Council, have remained doggedly supportive.\n\nAnd the majority of evangelical women remain in his corner.\n\nBut it has not been easy.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know any evangelical woman who is going to defend the character of the president,\u201d said Carmen Fowler LaBerge, host of \u201cThe Reconnect,\u201d an evangelical-centered radio show.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cMany things the president says and does are things that many evangelicals use as examples with our kids of what we should not do,\u201d added Ms. LaBerge, who did not support Mr. Trump in 2016. \u201cThis is not who we are as evangelicals. This is not how we treat people.\u201d\n\nSome evangelical women simply keep their views private. Gathered at a well-appointed home in Falls Church, Va., last week, eight Christian women agreed to talk about their feelings about the president, on one condition: that they not be identified.\n\nThey feared reprisal in the workplace, at their children\u2019s schools, even at their church. They meet in secret and have a private Facebook group, which its organizer said has about 160 members, to talk about their support for Mr. Trump.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

One of the women said that her parents had come to the United States illegally from El Salvador and that she was born a short time later. Her father is now a citizen. She supports Mr. Trump and his hard-line plans on immigration.\n\n\u201cI would say that this year has only made me more of a certain supporter,\u201d said another of the women, Joanna, who agreed to be identified only by her first name. \u201cI\u2019ve been really excited to see him come through with his promises, one by one, against incredible odds.\u201d\n\nStill, there is a tension among evangelical women. They said they largely cast their votes against Hillary Clinton more than for Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cAt least in my experience, it was more of an anti-Hillary vote than a pro-Trump vote,\u201d Ms. LaBerge said.\n\nKaren Swallow Prior, a professor at Liberty University who opposed Mr. Trump and voted for a third-party candidate, said, \u201cNow that Trump is in office and we are evaluating his performance then, I am glad to see that people are less in lock step and thinking critically about him as a leader, and it doesn\u2019t surprise me that his overall support would decline from 80 percent.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was one of those culture war evangelicals in the \u201980s and \u201990s,\u201d Ms. Swallow Prior said. \u201cI was appalled by the candidacy and presidency of Bill Clinton. It was hammered into my mind that character mattered, and that did change when Trump came along. In some ways, I felt betrayed by my evangelical peers who taught me and cemented in me the idea that character matters. I didn\u2019t abandon that belief. I feel like some evangelicals did.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHer outspoken criticism is all the more notable given that the president of Liberty University, Mr. Falwell, remains one of the president\u2019s most vocal defenders.\n\nEvangelical voters, often portrayed as a monolith, are becoming increasingly difficult to define. The support for Mr. Trump reflects a growing pragmatism among evangelical voters who are willing to accept a less than ideal model of Christian faith in exchange for policies that they endorse.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019ve become experienced and very practical,\u201d said Frances FitzGerald, the author of the recent book \u201cThe Evangelicals: The Struggle to Shape America.\u201d \u201cBy large majorities they used to believe that to be elected, you had to be of good character. No longer. It\u2019s \u2018We want a president to do what we want him to do, and he\u2019s going to do it if we turn out and vote.\u2019\u201d\n\nMr. Trump also appeals to white evangelicals in other ways with his strong language, disruptive view of presidential norms and his policies on taxes. \u201cReligious right rhetoric has always been very martial \u2014 isolationist and martial at the same time,\u201d Ms. FitzGerald said.\n\nIn surveys conducted by LifeWay Research in Nashville, evangelical voters in 2016 cited the economy (30 percent) and national security (26 percent) as their top two issues. Abortion was cited by just 4 percent, said Scott McConnell, the company\u2019s executive director.\n\nEvangelical voters began to emerge as a political force with their support for Ronald Reagan in 1980 and became a more coherent movement with the 1988 presidential campaign of the religious broadcaster Pat Robertson and the rise of Christian Coalition. But there are now few obvious leaders of religious conservatism, and voters have become more conventional in their assessment of candidates.\n\nAnd even among religious conservatives, the Pew poll suggests tolerance for Mr. Trump has its limits.\n\n\u201cIt may simply be that there\u2019s not a single breaking point as much as a tipping point, the \u2018Oh Lord, I can\u2019t stand another one of these,\u2019\u201d said William Martin, a scholar at the Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University and author of \u201cWith God on Our Side,\u201d which charted the political rise of the religious right.", "keywords": ["white", "supporters", "mr", "core", "evangelicals", "support", "ms", "trump", "president", "religious", "evangelical", "begin", "women", "tiptoeing", "voters", "away"], "polarity": 0.16382375340708674, "subjectivity": 0.42349687349687354},

And they want to build momentum and voter enthusiasm for the midterm elections in the fall, when they hope to topple Republican control of the House of Representatives.\n\nFor their part, Republicans are anxious to secure President Trump\u2019s popularity with his heartland base, break a streak of weak showings in special elections since he took office, and dispel the Democratic narrative of a rising tide of anti-Trump and anti-Republican sentiment among voters. They want the political map to stay the way Mr. Trump recolored it in 2016.\n\nWhether Mr. Lamb wins or loses \u2014 polls suggest a dead heat in a district that President Trump won by about 20 percentage points \u2014 the lessons from the race will resonate throughout the heartland in November. Democrats will be defending vulnerable Senate seats and trying to pick up House districts and governors\u2019 mansions in Pennsylvania, Ohio and other states where Mrs. Clinton fell short.\n\nMr. Lamb has been able to make the race close in such a deep-red district in part because of his moderate views on social issues like guns. He insists that he is not running against Mr. Trump. And he agrees with the president on the need for protective tariffs on steel and aluminum.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Trump himself visited the region on Saturday to champion his 25 percent steel tariff, which is broadly popular here in the crucible of American steel, and also to throw a protective cloak around the embattled Republican in the House race, Rick Saccone.\n\n\u201cYour steel is coming back,\u201d Mr. Trump declared.\n\nIn his trademark fashion, he tagged Mr. Lamb with an insulting nickname, Lamb the Sham, and claimed to be better looking than the tall, square-jawed, 33-year-old former Marine and prosecutor.\n\nMr. Trump predicted that while Mr. Lamb may act like a centrist, he would fall in line behind liberal party leaders in Washington. \u201cFor getting your votes, he\u2019s talking about how much he likes tariffs, which is my baby,\u201d the president said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt is unclear whether voters\u2019 approval of Mr. Trump, which is still strong in the district, will translate into ballots cast for Mr. Saccone, 60, a state representative and former Air Force counterintelligence officer.\n\nUnion leaders insisted that many voters in the district would effectively split their tickets, backing the Democratic Party this year even if they had cast ballots for Mr. Trump in 2016.\n\nOrganized labor has been losing ground in the American workplace for years, but unions are still politically potent in places like the 18th District, where union carpenters, steelworkers, nurses and other tradespeople and their families account for nearly one in four votes.\n\nIt is a district with a minority population of just 7 percent, making unions there a proxy for the white working class. Those voters had been drifting away from the Democrats, a trend that accelerated in 2016, and the party desperately wants to win back their support.\n\nProtectionist tariffs, which most economists warn will hurt more American workers than they help, were a Democratic rallying cry before the era of Bill Clinton. As a candidate, Mr. Trump appropriated the issue, as part of his pledge to restore factories to beleaguered cities. That stance helped pave the way for the narrow victories over Mrs. Clinton in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan that won him the White House.\n\nAccording to internal polling by the A.F.L.-C.I.O., Mrs. Clinton won 10 percent fewer union votes than former President Barack Obama did in 2012.\n\nPhoto\n\nMany of the voters were indifferent to the Clinton campaign\u2019s attacks on Mr. Trump\u2019s character, which blanketed the airwaves, while he broke through to them with his racially tinged \u201cAmerica First\u201d appeals.\n\n\u201cA lot of our members just didn\u2019t trust Hillary Clinton,\u201d said Tim Waters, the political director of the United Steelworkers. \u201cDonald Trump talked a lot about working-class voter issues, especially on trade. It resonated with a lot of people in working-class neighborhoods. We\u2019re hoping that in 2018, the Democratic Party figures out you can\u2019t have the same message in Phoenix that you have in Pittsburgh.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nUnions have a ready foil in Mr. Saccone, who supports so-called right-to-work legislation in Harrisburg, the state capital, and who opposed requiring the use of American-made materials in public projects.

Outside the gates of an Allegheny Technologies steel plant in Washington, Pa., deep in the 18th District, workers coming and going during the changeover to the afternoon shift almost all said they had voted for Mr. Trump.\n\nMost said they still approved of the president\u2019s job performance, and for some, that support extended to Mr. Saccone as well. A number took at face value the flood of TV attack ads that outside Republican groups had been airing, trying to tie Mr. Lamb to Representative Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader, whose social positions make her unpopular here.\n\n\u201cIf he\u2019s a Nancy Pelosi supporter, I\u2019m not going to vote for him,\u201d Brad Phillips, 45, said.\n\nMr. Lamb has said repeatedly that he would defy Ms. Pelosi. But a Republican attack ad insists that he, like Ms. Pelosi, favors cuts to Medicare \u2014 a hoary accusation based on the Affordable Care Act\u2019s reduction of payments to health providers. (Republicans in Congress retain those same reductions in their bills to repeal the health law.)\n\nMr. Phillips seemed to cite that attack ad as evidence of Mr. Lamb\u2019s duplicity. \u201cSome of the things she\u2019s supported, he\u2019s backed her,\u201d he said.\n\nPhoto\n\nJim Harris, who has worked 31 years at the mill, said he switched his voter registration to Republican a few years ago, and although he is not enthusiastic about Mr. Saccone, he likes Mr. Lamb less. \u201cI can\u2019t go with them Democrats no more,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re against everything I believe in.\u201d Referring to abortion rights and gun control, he said, \u201cThey\u2019re against God, they\u2019re killing kids, they want our guns.\u201d\n\nFor Kellen Hodge, 60, the Pelosi attack ads also made an impression, but he was skeptical of them because he takes it for granted that all politicians lie. Mr. Lamb appealed to him, he said, because he has never held office before. \u201cI am a Republican, but I probably will vote for Conor Lamb because he is new blood.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe skeptical attitude some rank-and-file steelworkers have toward Mr. Lamb suggests that Democrats face challenges in winning back white working-class voters they lost in 2016.\n\nJohn Russo, a retired labor studies professor at Youngstown State University, recently took most Ohio Democrats running in 2018 to task for offering \u201calmost nothing in the way of concrete economic platforms.\u201d\n\nStanley Greenberg, a Democratic pollster who first identified the phenomenon of Reagan Democrats, was also critical of the party. \u201cHave they put working people at the center of their agenda?\u201d he asked. \u201cDo working people believe Democrats wake up each day worrying about whether those folks are able to get ahead? I think there\u2019s still a long way to go.\u201d\n\nWithin the party, there is a boisterous faction that argues that the Democrats\u2019 future lies with college-educated suburbanites and minorities, and that trying to win back white working-class voters may be a lost cause.\n\nOne reason Mr. Lamb seems poised to exceed expectations for a Democrat in his district is the anti-Trump fervor of progressive voters concentrated in the white-collar suburbs close to Pittsburgh.\n\nThese voters have swamped the polls in nearly every election of the past year, from Virginia to rural Wisconsin, and Democrats have been outperforming their November 2016 results in race after race.\n\nChuck Moser, a sales director for Cisco who held a fund-raiser for Mr. Lamb at a private club in Sewickley, an affluent suburb, waited in a long line last week to hear former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. campaign for Mr. Lamb.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t previously stood out in chilly weather waiting to go to rallies,\u201d he said.\n\nHe and his wife, Barb, 40, described themselves as more liberal than Mr. Lamb.\n\nMr. Moser said voters like them would make an important difference on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cHe really does not want to run against Donald Trump in this district,\u201d Mr. Moser said of Mr. Lamb. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t mention his name. He doesn\u2019t contrast himself. But what I\u2019m seeing is, a lot of the energy for the Democrats is based upon the dislike of Donald Trump.

Despite the other benefits of the law, he said, he would rather be governed by the old tax code than face a competitive disadvantage to nearby cooperatives.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThomas Lien Jr., of Dakota Mill and Grain in Rapid City, S.D., said that he already regretted the $20 million investment his business made last year to build a shuttle loader grain elevator for moving large quantities of grain because farmers were now only interested in selling to cooperatives. Now he wondered how his business and others like it could survive.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to drive investments in rural America away,\u201d Mr. Lien said. \u201cWe can\u2019t compete.\u201d\n\nRestaurants and retailers are also concerned about a drafting error that will mitigate the tax benefits they receive when renovating. The law was supposed to simplify depreciation rules for businesses making renovations or other property improvements so that they could deduct these expenses over 15 years. Because of a mistake in the writing of the bill, the cost of these investments must be deducted over 39 years, diminishing the intended benefit.\n\nThe top lobbyist for the restaurant industry said that she was hopeful that lawmakers had heard their complaints.\n\n\u201cIt is our understanding that it was an honest mistake,\u201d said the lobbyist, Cicely Simpson, the executive vice president of public affairs at the National Restaurant Association. \u201cThe bipartisan intent behind the law was a 15-year depreciation period, and we are confident Congress will have this resolved quickly.\u201d\n\nBut legislative fixes will be tough. Unlike the original tax bill, which passed along party lines, legislation correcting any portion of the tax bill will require Democratic votes to get through the Senate.\n\nThe law passed Congress via the budget reconciliation process, which bypassed a Senate filibuster and enabled Republicans to approve it on a party-line vote in both chambers. A fix-it bill would need at least nine Democrats in the Senate to join Republicans.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

For example, the Chamber of Commerce is pushing to ensure the deduction applies to investors in mutual funds that own stakes in real estate investment trusts.\n\nIt also includes a dizzying number of concerns over the new system for taxing multinational corporations that the law created.\n\nPhoto\n\nThose corporations are upset over the possible scope of two provisions that collectively form a sort of alternative minimum tax for companies operating in the United States and overseas. The bill\u2019s architects pitched those provisions as a means of cracking down on companies that shift profits to foreign parent companies or subsidiaries to avoid American taxes.\n\nBut affected companies say they fear the legislation could be construed overly broadly by officials at Treasury or the Internal Revenue Service, subjecting activities that those companies do not consider forms of profit-shifting to the minimum tax.\n\nA Chevron executive called one of the minimum tax provisions \u201ca disaster\u201d last month at a public forum. At the same event, an Eli Lilly official said the provisions discouraged companies from holding intellectual property in the United States, counter to the intent of Congress, because they forced those companies to reimburse foreign affiliates doing work outside the country.\n\nMany companies are looking to Treasury to resolve those concerns. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce\u2019s list of requests includes several suggestions for ways the department can limit the minimum tax\u2019s reach.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRepublican lawmakers who wrote the bill, however, are not looking kindly on efforts to change the intent of the law.

Hatch, Republican of Utah and the chairman of the Finance Committee, wrote in a letter last month to Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary.

Throughout last year, Mr. Cobb kept Mr. Trump from publicly airing grievances against Mr. Mueller in part by telling him that the investigation would be wrapped up by December, or soon after \u2014 an assessment that proved too optimistic.\n\nBut there have been signs in recent months that Mr. Trump may be looking to shake up his legal team and change his approach to Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation. The president has polled his advisers and friends, asking them what they think of Mr. Cobb, who persuaded Mr. Trump to take a cooperative approach to the inquiry.\n\nIn private conversations, Mr. Trump has seesawed between expressing confidence in Mr. Cobb\u2019s claim that the inquiry will wrap up in relatively short order and that he will be exonerated, and sounding frustrated with his team\u2019s legal strategy.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Cobb has clashed with the White House counsel, Donald F.

Commerce has tended to plunge, with the working class suffering lost jobs and diminished livelihoods. Alliances have been frayed, heightening international tensions.\n\nMany economists and international-relations experts assume that Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs could play out much the same way, isolating the United States while imperiling a global economic expansion.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNot least, the tariffs seem likely to present the World Trade Organization with a potentially existential crisis.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe organization has been described as the referee for global commerce, settling disputes on the basis of rules adopted by consensus among its 164 members. Now, the referee may be on the verge of losing control of the game.\n\nIn justifying its tariffs as a response to a supposed threat to national security \u2014 a contention that has drawn derision from economists \u2014 the Trump administration has virtually ensured a challenge from the European Union via a complaint filed with the trade organization. That would put the institution in a predicament in which any course risks undermining its authority.\n\nThe trade organization could rule in favor of the United States, deferring to American sovereignty and its right to determine its national security policies. But that would hand every country on earth a template to break with the norms of international trade.\n\n\u201cThis would open the floodgates to everyone bringing in broad exceptions,\u201d said Ms. Crowley, the Cambridge expert.\n\nOr the body could rule against the United States, rejecting the argument that metal forged in Europe poses a mortal peril to Americans. The Trump administration might then ignore the ruling and carry on, forcing the W.T.O. to give countries the right to retaliate.\n\nHostilities would most likely expand well beyond steel and aluminum. Mr. Trump\u2019s pledge of tariffs has enraged and astounded American allies whose fortunes are tied to producing these metals, like Japan, South Korea, Germany and Taiwan.\n\nOn Wednesday, the European Union outlined plans to retaliate with tariffs on a variety of American goods, including motorcycles, rice and bourbon. If reprisals continued, Europe might limit exports of other American agricultural products, intensifying its push against genetically modified crops. In the most extreme case, Europe might even impede American investment.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a real chance that everyone reacts very negatively,\u201d said Jennifer A.

An eye for an eye will leave us all blind and the world in deep recession.\u201d\n\nTrade frictions are a constant in the global economy. Governments wield tariffs, import quotas and other instruments to protect sensitive industries. But a trade war is different, holding the potential to damage living standards on multiple continents.\n\n\u201cYou start viewing it as a conflict between nations,\u201d said Adam S. Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a research institution in Washington. \u201cYou put a premium on doing damage rather than deterring bad behavior.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Trump and his advisers appear to be calculating that, as the largest economy on earth, the United States possesses enough muscle to dictate the terms of world trade.\n\n\u201cThey are under the delusion that the United States has been screwed by the global system that it created,\u201d Mr. Posen said. \u201cThey apparently think that everyone else will fold if they stand up.\u201d\n\nThat idea, he added, is about to be exposed as wrong.\n\nAs the United States grappled with the Great Depression, a Republican-controlled Congress seized on protectionism as the fix, adopting the infamous Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 to wall off American farms and factories from foreign competition.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe law sharply increased tariffs on hundreds of goods \u2014 from sugar to shoes to iron. American trading partners responded with their own tariffs, and commerce deteriorated, deepening the depression.\n\nAfter Democrats captured control of Congress and the White House in 1932, tariffs fell sharply, bolstering American trade. But Britain, France, Germany and other European powers maintained steep tariffs. Trade disintegrated, exacerbating nationalist animosities that exploded into World War II.\n\nThe last substantial outbreak of trade hostilities played out in the 1980s, as the United States grappled with the consequences of a rising Japan. The American auto industry \u2014 caught unprepared for the public\u2019s embrace of smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles \u2014 lobbied Washington for tariffs to limit a surge of Japanese imports. President Ronald Reagan ultimately pressured Japan to voluntarily restrict auto exports to the United States.\n\nJapanese-made automobiles sold in the United States soared in price. Seeking to avoid tariffs while improving trust, Japanese car companies began setting up plants to make their vehicles in the United States, employing American workers.\n\nTrade advisers to Mr. Trump cite this history as an example of how an aggressive stance can set up fruitful trade negotiations. But major differences separate that episode from today.\n\nBack in the 1980s, auto plants needed to be built somewhere to serve swelling American demand for small cars. Japan was firmly dependent on good relations with Washington for its security, making it prone to avoid conflict.\n\nToday\u2019s primary American trade antagonist is China, ruled by the apparent president-for-life Xi Jinping, whose nationalist credo does not leave room for caving to pressure from Washington. The world faces a glut of steel, much of it made in China. Whatever tariffs the Trump administration maintains, foreign steel manufacturers are not likely to construct new plants in the United States.\n\nAmong proponents of liberalized trade, the most hopeful history may be the most recent chapter.\n\nIn 2002, President George W. Bush put tariffs on steel to protect American producers against imports. Then, as now, companies that make products using steel vastly outnumbered those that produce the metal. As automakers and other steel buyers confronted higher costs, the tariffs eliminated some 200,000 jobs, according to one study.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nForeign steel producers filed a challenge at the W.T.O., which ruled that the United States had acted without justification. Europe prepared a list of American goods to stick with retaliatory tariffs. Mr. Bush backed down.\n\nBut if the global trading apparatus successfully defused that crisis, the current situation presents a different challenge given the nature of the commander waging the attack.\n\n\u201cThe fundamental view of this administration seems to be, somewhat bizarrely, that the United States has not benefited from trade,\u201d Ms. Crowley said. \u201cIt seems like it\u2019s not really registering how damaging this could be.\u201d", "keywords": ["states", "mr", "trade", "united", "american", "shot", "wider", "risks", "conflict", "warning", "tariffs", "trump", "trading", "igniting", "steel", "world", "trumps"], "polarity": 0.059980768822680594, "subjectivity": 0.35569929865885763},

Blood is not thicker than money for a lot of people.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, the Kushner Companies said the Trumps \u201chave zero equity of any type in our properties or businesses.\u201d In Long Branch, the statement said, \u201cwe are contemplating a third-party operator agreement with their hotel management division at market rate.\u201d Noting that it did not specialize in the hospitality industry, the company said it had \u201ca business obligation to seek the most capable resource.\u201d\n\nIn an interview, Eric Danziger, the head of Trump Hotels, disputed that teaming up with the Kushners might pose a conflict.\n\n\u201cThis is a straight-up business deal,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there were something out of the ordinary about the deal, then I think that question is fair,\u201d he said, but \u201cwe do market transactions that are reviewed and checked.\u201d\n\nMr. Danziger said that Bobby Burchfield, the Trump Organization\u2019s outside ethics adviser, had asked about the financing involved in a potential Long Branch deal with the Kushners. Mr. Burchfield, who scrutinizes how the Trump Organization\u2019s partners finance deals, among other things, often requires more information before approving a deal.\n\nWhether or not the Trumps and Kushners reach a deal, Mr. Kushner stands to gain. He is expected to eventually own 20 percent of the hotel in Pier Village, according to documents obtained through a public records request. And he was personally involved in the project early in the presidential campaign. In documents provided to Long Branch, the Kushner Companies stated that Mr. Kushner \u201cis strictly a passive investor.\u201d\n\nHe also retains a stake in a Kushner residential tower in Jersey City that bears the Trump name.\n\nIn Livingston, Mr. Kushner has divested from the Westminster Hotel, a three-story property overlooking strip malls. While it is unusual for the Trumps to manage hotels that do not carry one of their brands, Mr. Danziger said he was discussing similar deals with other companies as a way to expand the business under the \u201cright circumstances.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn owner wants to know they can depend on and rely on the operator, and we have a lot of credibility as operators,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe growing relationship between the families could be helpful to the Trumps, as the ethical restraints they voluntarily adopted after the election have proved to be a hindrance to new business. The Trump Organization, which agreed not to start any new foreign projects during the presidency, has yet to open a new hotel in the United States since Mr. Trump took office.\n\nWhile Mr. Danziger said the pipeline of potential deals was \u201cstill very active,\u201d the company has also shown some signs of scaling back: Since the election, the Trump name has been removed from properties in Manhattan, Toronto and Panama.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

If the Trumps manage a Kushner property that received foreign or domestic government funding, it could test the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clauses, which essentially prohibit the president from accepting certain gifts from foreign or domestic governments. Some legal experts argue that local bonds like the ones issued in Long Branch could brush against the domestic clause.\n\nThe Kushners, who co-own the development with Extell Development, a New York real estate firm, said they would not accept money from foreign governments.\n\nThe firm, however, has a history of seeking cash from investors with strong connections to foreign governments, including Anbang, an insurance company in China.\n\nThe Kushners also have a history of teaming up with Israeli investors, which is ethically thorny for Mr. Kushner, whose central responsibilities in the White House include handling Middle East policy. Extell\u2019s bonds have traded on the Tel Aviv stock exchange.\n\nThe Kushners also used money from Chinese investors to finance the construction of Trump Bay Street, the residential tower in Jersey City. The Chinese money came through the so-called EB-5 program, which offers visas to foreigners in exchange for $500,000 investments in real estate projects. Federal prosecutors have been investigating the Kushner businesses\u2019 use of the program, though the company has said it no longer pursues this type of funding and \u201cdid nothing improper.\u201d\n\nIn addition, investigators working for Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel looking into Russian interference in the 2016 election, have asked questions about Mr. Kushner\u2019s interactions with foreign businesspeople, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.\n\nIn Long Branch, the Kushners are moving ahead with building the hotel in Pier Village and may add more hotels in the area.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe talks with the Trumps have focused largely on the Pier Village property under construction, which might carry the Scion brand, a new line of four-star hotels the Trumps announced in 2016. The Kushner Companies, however, said on Friday that it planned only to have the Trumps manage the hotel.\n\nThe hotel construction is part of the latest phase of a decades-long effort to remake the Long Branch waterfront after a fire destroyed the boardwalk in 1987 and contributed to a downward spiral.\n\nMayor Adam Schneider and local business leaders spearheaded a redevelopment plan in the 1990s that gave rise to Pier Village. The effort increased the city\u2019s annual beachfront revenue from $200,000 in the early 1990s to more than $2 million in 2017, the mayor said.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Kushners have long owned an oceanfront house in an exclusive section of town, and in 2014, they teamed up with Extell to buy Pier Village.\n\nWith the purchase, the Kushners took over the part of Pier Village that already had a row of restaurants and shops, as well as a vacant strip of land that will eventually feature luxury residential condominiums, retail stores and the hotel.\n\nMr. Kushner was involved in planning the project. He was copied on emails with city officials, and the mayor recalls meeting with him twice.\n\nMr. Kushner assumed a role in the White House, but his sister, Nicole Meyer, and his father, Charles Kushner, continued to work on the effort, including discussions with officials about the bonds.\n\nIn September, the City Council unanimously approved the bonds to help close a \u201cfunding gap.\u201d The city will borrow the money to reimburse Kushner Companies and Extell for approved costs that arise from building public improvements such as a boardwalk, public restrooms and a children\u2019s play area.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Schneider said that the arrangement would not cause a tax increase, and that the city had struck a better deal with the Kushners and Extell than with the previous owners of Pier Village.\n\nThe city expects to more than recoup its investment by collecting an annual service charge and other payments that the Kushners and Extell pay in lieu of certain taxes. And the city said it had obtained a personal guarantee from Charles Kushner.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually a very lucrative deal to municipalities,\u201d Mr. Schneider said.\n\nA week after the city approved the bonds, emails show, Ms. Meyer invited local officials to lunch at the Beach House restaurant at Pier Village. \u201cPlease let us know if you would like to join,\u201d the invitation said, \u201cand thank you for all your support and efforts!\u201d\n\nWhen informed by reporters that the Trump Organization might ultimately be involved in a hotel in his town, Mr. Schneider, a Democrat first elected in 1990, sighed and expressed concern.\n\nBut he added: \u201cOur success is that we have a hotel that\u2019s doing a great volume of business that\u2019s creating jobs and economic vitality.

This is why everyone in the region is having the same reaction: equal parts relief and alarm.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s seemingly unstoppable series of erratic moves has helped cast China as the more stable power in Asia. But it has also diverted attention from Chinese actions that would otherwise have raised much more alarm.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cOne of the most underreported consequences of the last 18 months is that China has gotten a free pass,\u201d said Mr. Flake, citing the country\u2019s military buildup on islands in the South China Sea, its economic punishment of South Korea for cooperating with the United States on a missile defense system and, most recently, President Xi Jinping\u2019s power grab, persuading the Communist Party to abolish limits on his time in office.\n\nUnder any other American administration, \u201cthe dominant narrative would have been Chinese overreach and internal crackdowns,\u201d Mr. Flake said. \u201cBut that narrative has been completely washed away by the chaos that is Trump.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe most recent announcements out of Washington, particularly the tariffs, could hurt China.

Japan and South Korea in particular, whose relations have recently deteriorated over longstanding historical disputes, find themselves jockeying for Washington\u2019s favor.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn Japan, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has worked hard to cultivate a warm relationship with Mr. Trump. So even as Mr. Trump withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a multilateral trade deal centered in Asia, and imposed the new steel and aluminum tariffs, government officials have tempered their criticism.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cJapan and the United States are allies, so the Japanese government doesn\u2019t want to be too negative towards the Trump government,\u201d said Kazuhiro Maeshima, a professor of politics at Sophia University in Tokyo.\n\nSouth Korea, meanwhile, lobbied for an exemption to the tariffs, citing the importance of the alliance. The envoys who visited the White House to brief Mr. Trump on their meeting with Mr. Kim made personal appeals to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and the national security adviser, Gen. H.R. McMaster, on the tariff issue, according to Kim Eui-kyeom, a spokesman for President Moon Jae-in.\n\nThe tariffs prompted harsh words in some South Korean news outlets for the leader of the country\u2019s most important ally. \u201cHis style of governing, marked by disconnectedness and arrogance, is just mind-blowing,\u201d a liberal daily newspaper, Hankyoreh, said in a Saturday editorial.\n\nFor Asian allies, perhaps the most difficult task in dealing with Mr. Trump \u2014 one that is hardly unique to foreign governments \u2014 is scrambling to discern his true intentions.\n\nMr. Trump often \u201cis saying one thing in Japan and another thing in Seoul,\u201d said Yoshiki Mine, a former Japanese Foreign Ministry official who was involved in past talks between Japan and North Korea, and who now runs a think tank, the Institute of Peaceful Diplomacy.\n\nMr. Moon, after being sidelined by Washington in its approach to North Korea a few months ago, would now seem to be in favor, having effectively brokered Mr. Kim\u2019s invitation to Mr. Trump. But analysts warned that the talks could go in directions South Korea might not welcome.\n\n\u201cWe quickly get to the question of what is going to be talked about here,\u201d said Ms. Rapp-Hooper. \u201cKim Jong-un is clearly not ready to give up his nuclear weapons. If it gets to that, he will make extreme security demands, not only a security guarantee, but demanding that we end our alliance with South Korea and withdraw our troops from the peninsula.\u201d\n\nIf Mr. Trump offered to significantly reduce America\u2019s presence in South Korea in exchange for limits on the North\u2019s nuclear program, it would be a setback for South Korea and Japan and a long-term win for China.\n\nAmerican allies in the region, along with many developing countries in Southeast Asia, want the United States to maintain a strong presence, as much to counterbalance China as to promote democratic values, said Kristi Govella, an assistant professor of Asian studies at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cMost countries would prefer not to be dominated by anybody \u2014 whether it is the U.S. or China or Japan,\u201d Ms. Govella said. \u201cEspecially for the smaller countries, they want to hedge a bit and have different options, and not be subject to the will of any particular country.\u201d", "keywords": ["states", "mr", "japan", "trade", "north", "china", "united", "kim", "korea", "trump", "south", "door", "unpredictability", "trumps", "opens"], "polarity": 0.0846370726974175, "subjectivity": 0.3800292954172265},

I get it, I get it, he said.\n\nWhere others see flashing yellow lights and slow down, Mr. Trump speeds up. And just like that, in the course of 45 minutes in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump threw aside caution and dispensed with decades of convention to embark on a daring, high-wire diplomatic gambit aimed at resolving one of the world\u2019s most intractable standoffs.\n\nThe story of how this came about, assembled through interviews with officials and analysts from the United States, South Korea, Japan and China, is a case study in international relations in the Trump era. A president with no prior foreign policy experience takes on a festering conflict that has vexed the world for years with a blend of impulse and improvisation, and with no certain outcome. One moment, he is hurling playground insults and threatening nuclear war, the next he is offering the validation of a presidential meeting.\n\nWhether the high-stakes gamble ultimately pays off, no one can know. Given two unpredictable and highly combustible leaders, it seems just as likely that the meeting will never take place. If it does occur, the challenges are so steep, the gulf so wide and the history so fraught with misunderstanding, suspicion and broken promises that the prospect of an enduring resolution to the impasse seems remote.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has staked his reputation as a deal maker on the presumption that he can personally achieve what no other president has before him.\n\nA Thorny Road\n\nThe path to a possible meeting led through a thicket of hostility and feints.\n\nThroughout his first year in office, Mr. Trump ratcheted up economic sanctions while rattling his nuclear saber at \u201cLittle Rocket Man\u201d and threatening to \u201ctotally destroy North Korea.\u201d\n\nMr. Kim could match the president he called \u201cthe mentally deranged U.S. dotard\u201d bombast for bombast. In a New Year\u2019s Day speech, he said he had \u201ca nuclear button on the desk\u201d that could launch missiles capable of reaching the United States. Mr. Trump responded with a tweet saying that \u201cI too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his.\u201d\n\nBut South Korea\u2019s president, Moon Jae-in, focused on the other part of Mr. Kim\u2019s speech, when he declared that he would send athletes to the Winter Olympics, which would be held the next month in South Korea. A flurry of negotiations ensued at Panmunjom, the \u201ctruce village\u201d inside the Korean demilitarized zone, that, by the standards of inter-Korean talks, went unusually well.\n\nPhoto\n\nFor the opening ceremony, on Feb. 9, Mr. Kim sent his sister, Kim Yo-jong, while Mr. Trump sent Vice President Mike Pence. The vice president was told of a possible meeting with North Korean officials at the Games if he would tone down his message, not talk about sanctions, not meet with defectors and not bring along Fred Warmbier, whose son, Otto, an American student, died soon after being released from captivity in North Korea.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Pence opted to do all of those anyway to show resolve, and the North Koreans canceled the meeting at the last minute. Taking the hard-line position he believed the president wanted him to take, a grim-faced Mr. Pence refused to stand for the entry of the joint Korean team that included athletes from both North and South and made a point of refusing to greet Mr. Kim\u2019s sister, who was just 10 feet away.\n\nMr. Pence\u2019s failure to stand was taken as an insult to Mr. Moon and the South Korean public, undercutting the vice president\u2019s intent to show solidarity with an ally. Mr. Moon had been determined to bring the Americans and North Koreans together, to the irritation of the American delegation, which believed that he was deliberately trying to stage-manage an encounter they considered awkward and inappropriate.\n\nMr. Moon, by contrast, hosted Ms. Kim for a lavish luncheon at the presidential Blue House, and she surprised him with a letter from her brother. She told Mr. Moon that her brother wanted to convene a summit meeting at an early date. The two spent nearly three hours together, with Mr. Moon doing most of the talking.\n\nHe said that he really wanted to meet Mr. Kim and improve ties, but that there was a limit to how far he could go without progress in dismantling the North\u2019s nuclear program. He urged North Korea to talk to the Americans and said they needed to hurry so as not to lose the rare momentum from the spirit of the Olympics visits.\n\nA Family Envoy\n\nAfter the unfortunate optics from Mr. Pence\u2019s visit and what some viewed as a missed opportunity, Mr. Trump sent his daughter, Ivanka Trump, to the closing ceremony of the Games. She had dinner with Mr. Moon at the Blue House and briefed him on new sanctions her father would impose on North Korea, then made a public statement to reporters reaffirming the American strategy of \u201cmaximum pressure.\u201d\n\nShe then headed to Pyeongchang for the last two days of competition. Briefed by Mr. Pence\u2019s staff, Ms. Trump and her team were \u201cincredibly forceful,\u201d as one official put it, in going over the seating plan for the box and the timing and sequencing of arrivals to avoid any surprises.\n\nMs. Trump proffered a smiling, more open image that went over better in South Korea. She stood for the South Korean athletes, who this time entered the stadium separately from their compatriots from the North, and posed for photographs with famous Korean pop stars. But she too made a point of sending a message; for her guest in the box, she brought Gen. Vincent K. Brooks, commander of American forces in South Korea.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen she attended a curling event, Ms. Trump\u2019s team received word that the North Koreans were on their way in what the Americans thought was an effort to make a scene or prompt her to leave in an embarrassing spectacle. Ms. Trump decided to stay, and the North Koreans in the end did not come.\n\nAll Smiles in the North\n\nWith the Olympics over, it was time for Mr. Moon to make his move. Last week, he sent two trusted aides on a two-day trip to Pyongyang: Mr. Chung, his national security adviser, and Suh Hoon, his National Intelligence Service director. Flying north, they knew that they were meeting Mr. Kim but not when.\n\nAfter landing in Pyongyang, they were taken to a riverside guesthouse where they found their rooms equipped with the internet and access to foreign television channels, including CNN. They could even surf South Korean websites, a rare privilege in the totalitarian state. As soon as they unpacked, Kim Yong-chol, a general who heads inter-Korean relations, showed up and said that they were meeting Mr. Kim that evening.\n\nBlack limousines took the South Koreans to Azalea Hall in the ruling Workers\u2019 Party headquarters, Mr. Kim\u2019s workplace. They found Mr. Kim and his sister waiting to greet them with broad smiles. Mr. Chung and Mr. Suh were the first South Koreans to set foot inside the party headquarters since the Korean War.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Chung had barely launched into his talking points when Mr. Kim said \u201cI know\u201d and \u201cI understand you.\u201d Then he laid out his proposal: talks with the United States on denuclearizing his country; a suspension of nuclear and missile tests during the talks; and his understanding that the United States and South Korea must proceed with annual joint military exercises.\n\nThe South Koreans found Mr. Kim to be an extremely confident leader. He was closely following foreign news media, knew how he was depicted, and even joked about it. He had studied Mr. Moon\u2019s speeches and overtures toward the North.\n\nHe even joked about his missile launches. \u201cI was sorry to hear that President Moon Jae-in had to convene his National Security Council meetings early in the morning because of our missile launchings,\u201d he told the South Koreans. \u201cNow, he won\u2019t lose his early morning sleep any more.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The South Koreans suggested Pyongyang, Seoul and Panmunjom as possible sites and asked Mr. Kim to choose. Mr. Kim said he would come to the Peace House, a South Korean building inside Panmunjom.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe meeting and dinner, complete with wines and traditional Korean liquor, lasted from 6 p.m. to 10:12 p.m. with much laughter and bonhomie.\n\nAfter returning to Seoul on Tuesday, the South Korean officials briefed Mr. Moon and then South Korean reporters. After his news conference, Mr. Chung called General McMaster and told him that he was carrying a message from Mr. Kim to Mr. Trump. Only several people at the Blue House knew that the message included a proposal for a meeting with Mr. Trump.\n\nOff to Washington\n\nMr. Chung and Mr. Suh flew to Washington, arriving Thursday morning. By the afternoon, they were at the White House, meeting separately with General McMaster and Gina Haspel, the deputy C.I.A. director. The four then got together and were soon joined by other American officials, including Mr. Pence, Mr. Mattis, Dan Coats, the national intelligence director, Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman, and John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff.\n\nJoined by their ambassador to Washington, the South Korean visitors were not supposed to meet with Mr. Trump until Friday, but when he heard they were in the building, he called them to the Oval Office.\n\nMr. Kim\u2019s invitation to meet was not a complete surprise to Mr. Trump\u2019s team. An American official said they had learned about it from intelligence agencies, so on Thursday morning, before the arrival of the South Koreans, Mr. Trump talked by phone with Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, who was traveling in Africa, about the possibility. What he did not tell Mr. Tillerson was that he would accept.\n\nMr. Trump was eager enough, however, that once he said yes, they discussed a meeting as early as next month. The South Koreans suggested it would be better to wait until after Mr. Moon\u2019s summit meeting with Mr. Kim in April, which led to a target of May.\n\nNot only did Mr. Trump surprise the South Koreans by accepting immediately, he even suggested that they make the public announcement right there and then at the White House.\n\nPhoto\n\nA stunned Mr. Chung retreated to General McMaster\u2019s office to draft a statement in collaboration with the Americans. Then, using a secure telephone line, he called Mr. Moon early in the morning in Seoul to get his approval.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nElated, Mr. Trump stuck his head into the White House briefing room to tell reporters there would be an important announcement soon, something he had never done before.\n\nSome of the president\u2019s advisers objected to the idea of a foreign official making a statement from the White House lectern, so they had him do it instead on the White House driveway, where visitors typically speak with reporters. Still, it was highly unusual for a foreign official to announce an American president\u2019s decision in a major international situation.\n\nOut of the Loop\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s quick decision caught many off guard, including Mr. Tillerson and American allies. Television networks set up live feeds from the White House driveway to carry Mr. Chung\u2019s announcement. Congressional leaders and top officials at the Pentagon and the State Department learned what was happening from news reports.\n\nThe fact that it came on the same day that the president slapped stiff new tariffs on imported steel that would hit South Korea and Japan hard indicated how hasty and unplanned it was.\n\nWhile Mr. Chung headed to the driveway, Mr. Trump hurriedly called Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan to let him know. Mr. Abe has worked assiduously to cultivate a close relationship with Mr. Trump and taken a hard line on North Korea, but he was left out of the loop, a fact that stung.\n\n\u201cI have an impression that the Japanese are not quite well informed,\u201d said Yoshiki Mine, head of a previous Japanese delegation seeking normalized relations with North Korea. \u201cWhat we have been told is awfully out of tune, I should say.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump did not reach President Xi Jinping of China until the next morning. China has backed Mr. Trump on North Korea, generating good will between Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi. But China refused last month to go along with an American plan to interdict oil tankers bound for North Korea on the high seas, demonstrating that there were limits to how far China would go in punishing Mr. Kim, given the risk of a North Korean collapse on its borders.\n\nMr. Trump said his conversation with Mr. Xi went well. \u201cPresident XI told me he appreciates that the U.S. is working to solve the problem diplomatically rather than going with the ominous alternative,\u201d the president wrote on Twitter on Saturday. \u201cChina continues to be helpful!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut in response to Mr. Trump\u2019s planned meeting, China is engaged in what some call \u201cexclusion anxiety,\u201d worried about being shut out. China would like the meeting to be held in Beijing, where six-nation talks were held with North Korea during President George W. Bush\u2019s administration, but Chinese analysts doubt Mr. Kim would agree.\n\nFor now, Mr. Trump is juggling these dynamics and preparing to meet the world\u2019s most hermetic leader.

The United States is also engaged in difficult negotiations with Mexico and Canada over changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement.\n\nIn Colombia, Mr. Trump will be repaying a visit Mr. Santos, a Harvard-trained economist who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2016 for negotiating a peace treaty with FARC guerrillas, made to the White House in May. At a news conference with Mr. Trump at the time, Mr. Santos sidestepped a question about whether he agreed with the White House\u2019s plan to build a wall on the border with Mexico to halt the flow of drugs into the United States.\n\nEarlier, Mr. Trump had said that coca cultivation and cocaine production had risen to record levels in Colombia, and challenged Mr. Santos to remedy the problem. The United States has a long history of cooperation with Colombia on that issue and others.\n\nThe efforts to build the border wall, along with the president\u2019s move in recent days to establish tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, have inflamed some of the leaders with whom he will meet in Peru. After vocal protests from Mexico and Canada, Mr. Trump granted those countries a temporary exemption from the tariffs. But Brazil, a major steel exporter to the United States, has not been given any such exemption.\n\nAmerican presidents have attended the Western Hemisphere meeting, known as the Summit of the Americas, in previous years \u2014 Barack Obama made history there in 2015 by meeting with President Ra\u00fal Castro of Cuba \u2014 but few have stoked as much indignation as Mr. Trump.\n\nAt least twice during Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency, efforts to set up a meeting between him and President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto of Mexico have been scotched over their bitter disagreement about the plan for the border wall.\n\nOrder Reprints | Today\u2019s Paper | Subscribe A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A 21 of the New York edition with the headline: Trump to Make First Visit as President to Latin America\n\n\n\n\n\n", "keywords": ["white", "mexico", "mr", "states", "trade", "united", "santos", "visit", "trump", "latin", "president", "america"], "polarity": 0.10005570409982174, "subjectivity": 0.32600267379679143},

Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times The Man Who Knew Too Little The most ignorant man in America knows that Donald Trump is president \u2014 but that\u2019s about it. Living a liberal fantasy is complicated. Erik Hagerman heads out for his morning ritual, a 30-minute drive into town for coffee and a scone at his favorite coffee shop in Athens, Ohio.CreditDamon Winter/The New York Times\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGLOUSTER, Ohio \u2014 At first, the experiment didn\u2019t have a name.\n\nRight after the election, Erik Hagerman decided he\u2019d take a break from reading about the hoopla of politics.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s victory shook him. Badly. And so Mr. Hagerman developed his own eccentric experiment, one that was part silent protest, part coping mechanism, part extreme self-care plan.\n\nHe swore that he would avoid learning about anything that happened to America after Nov. 8, 2016.\n\n\u201cIt was draconian and complete,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I wanted to just steer away from Trump or shift the conversation. It was like I was a vampire and any photon of Trump would turn me to dust.\u201d\n\nIt was just going to be for a few days. But he is now more than a year into knowing almost nothing about American politics. He has managed to become shockingly uninformed during one of the most eventful chapters in modern American history. He is as ignorant as a contemporary citizen could ever hope to be.\n\nJames Comey. Russia. Robert Mueller. Las Vegas. The travel ban. \u201cAlternative facts.\u201d Pussy hats. Scaramucci. Parkland. Big nuclear buttons. Roy Moore.\n\nHe knows none of it. To Mr. Hagerman, life is a spoiler.\n\n\u201cI just look at the weather,\u201d said Mr. Hagerman, 53, who lives alone on a pig farm in southeastern Ohio. \u201cBut it\u2019s only so diverting.\u201d\n\nHe says he has gotten used to a feeling that he hasn\u2019t experienced in a long time. \u201cI am bored,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not bugging me.\u201d\n\nImage Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times\n\nIt takes meticulous planning to find boredom. Mr. Hagerman commits as hard as a method actor, and his self-imposed regimen \u2014 white-noise tapes at the coffee shop, awkward scolding of friends, a ban on social media \u2014 has reshaped much of his life.\n\nExtreme as it is, it\u2019s a path that likely holds some appeal for liberals these days \u2014 a D.I.Y. version of moving to Canada.\n\nDemocrats, liberals and leftists have coped with this first year of the Trump presidency in lots of ways. Some subsist on the thin gruel of political cartoon shows and online impeachment petitions. Others dwell online in the thrilling place where conspiracy is indistinguishable from truth. Others have been inspired to action, making their first run for public office, taking local action or marching in their first protest rally.\n\nMr. Hagerman has done the opposite of all of them.\n\nThe fact that it\u2019s working for him \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m emotionally healthier than I\u2019ve ever felt,\u201d he said \u2014 has made him question the very value of being fed each day by the media. Why do we bother tracking faraway political developments and distant campaign speeches? What good comes of it? Why do we read all these tweets anyway?\n\n\u201cI had been paying attention to the news for decades,\u201d Mr. Hagerman said. \u201cAnd I never did anything with it.\u201d\n\nAt some point last year, he decided his experiment needed a name. He considered The Embargo, but it sounded too temporary. The Boycott? It came off a little whiny.\n\nMr. Hagerman has created a fortress around himself. \u201cTiny little boats of information can be dangerous,\u201d he said.\n\nHe decided that it would be called The Blockade.\n\nBehind the Blockade\n\nFor a guy who has gone to great lengths to essentially plug his ears, Mr. Hagerman sure does talk a lot. He is witty and discursive, punctuating his stories with wild-eyed grins, exaggerated grimaces and more than the occasional lost thread.\n\nI recently spent two days visiting his farm on the condition that I not bring news from the outside world. As the sun set over his porch, turning the rolling hills pink then purple then blue, he held forth, jumping from English architecture to the local pigs\u2019 eating habits to his mother\u2019s favorite basketball team to the philosophy of Kant. He can go days without seeing another soul.\n\nThis life is still fairly new. Just a few years ago, he was a corporate executive at Nike (senior director of global digital commerce was his official, unwieldy title) working with teams of engineers to streamline the online shopping experience. Before that, he had worked digital jobs at Walmart and Disney.\n\n\u201cI worked 12-, 14-hour days,\u201d he said. \u201cThe calendar completely booked.\u201d\n\nBut three years ago, he decided he had saved enough money to move to a farm, make elliptical sculptures \u2014 and, eventually, opt out of the national conversation entirely.\n\nHe lives alone and has never been married. As for money, a financial adviser in San Francisco manages his investments. Mr. Hagerman says he throws away the quarterly updates without reviewing them.\n\nMr. Hagerman grew up in southeastern Ohio, and after years spent in Brooklyn warehouses, San Francisco tech bubbles and Nike-land in Portland, Ore., the idea of a quiet life became more and more appealing. His mother lives nearby; he sees her a lot since he moved back in 2015. She reluctantly adheres to The Blockade, although they do discuss the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nImage Mr. Hagerman drives from his home into Athens for his morning rituals.

Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times\n\nMr. Hagerman begins every day with a 30-minute drive to Athens, the closest city of note, to get a cup of coffee \u2014 a triple-shot latte with whole milk. He goes early, before most customers have settled into the oversize chairs to scroll through their phones. To make sure he doesn\u2019t overhear idle chatter, he often listens to white noise through his headphones. (He used to listen to music, \u201cbut stray conversation can creep in between songs.\u201d)\n\nAt Donkey Coffee, everyone knows his order, and they know about The Blockade. \u201cOur baristas know where he\u2019s at so they don\u2019t engage him on topics that would make him uncomfortable,\u201d said Angie Pyle, the coffee shop\u2019s co-owner.\n\nMr. Hagerman has also trained his friends. A close friend from his Nike days, Parinaz Vahabzadeh, didn\u2019t think he was quite serious at first and, in the early days of The Blockade, kept dropping little hints about politics.\n\nThe new administration compelled her to engage more deeply in politics, not less. She had only recently become a United States citizen, and she was passionate about the immigration debate. She did not let Mr. Hagerman opt out easily. \u201cI was needling him,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd in response, she received, for the first time, a stern text message. \u201cI\u2019m now officially cross with you,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAs you know very well I don\u2019t wish to hear about current events. I know you don\u2019t agree with my wishes but I do expect you to respect them.\u201d\n\nThey now speak on the phone several times a week, but never about the news. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten used to it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s actually nice to not talk about politics.\u201d\n\nConversations with Mr. Hagerman can have a Rip Van Winkle quality. He spoke several times about his sister, Bonnie, an assistant professor, who lives in, of all places, Charlottesville, Va.\n\nWhile he and I were talking, I looked over at him at every mention of Charlottesville to see if the name of the city, home to perhaps the ugliest weekend of the Trump era to date, made him flinch.\n\n\u201cSo, do you associate Charlottesville\u201d \u2014 I would say the name deliberately and with emphasis \u2014 \u201cwith anything besides your sister?\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t bite. I think he really didn\u2019t know about the Nazis.\n\nLater, he pointed to a house on a hill and said that before the election, the neighbor had decorated his lawn with an effigy of Hillary Clinton behind bars. I wanted to point out that the recently unveiled Mueller indictment found that a Russian troll had paid for a Hillary impersonator at a Florida rally. But I bit my tongue \u2014 Mr. Hagerman didn\u2019t know about Mueller, or Russia, or trolls.\n\nImage Above Mr. Hagerman's bed is an art piece from a series he is currently working on at his home.

Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times\n\nLast winter, Mr. Hagerman spent several weeks visiting his twin brother, a tech C.E.O., in San Francisco. Strict arrangements had to be made \u2014 the Sunday newspaper kept out of sight, the TV switched off, his teenage niece and nephew under special instructions.\n\n\u201cThe bigger challenge was when we would have friends come over and visit,\u201d said his brother, Kris. \u201cWe had to have Erik not be there, or we would give them a heads up that Erik has this news blockade going and we gave them the guidelines.\n\n\u201cThey were always a little bemused by it. And to some extent a little envious,\u201d he said. \u201cThe prospect of just chucking all that for a period of time felt somewhat appealing.\u201d\n\nTo be fair, Mr. Hagerman has made a few concessions. He reads The New Yorker\u2019s art reviews, but is careful to flip past the illustrated covers, which often double as political commentary. He watches every Cavaliers game, but only on mute.\n\nHe counts a few boats that have sailed past The Blockade. He saw a picture of Kim Jong-un on a newspaper at the coffee shop, signaling that something was up with North Korea. And he overheard someone saying something about Obamacare, which meant health care was back in the news. His brother alerted him to the Equifax breach for his own protection.\n\n\u201cBut the blockade has been pretty damn effective,\u201d Mr. Hagerman said.\n\nHe said that with some pride, but he has the misgivings about disengaging from political life that you have, by now, surely been shouting at him as you read. \u201cThe first several months of this thing, I didn\u2019t feel all that great about it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes me a crappy citizen. It\u2019s the ostrich head-in-the-sand approach to political outcomes you disagree with.\u201d\n\nIt seems obvious to say, but to avoid current affairs is in some ways a luxury that many people, like, for example, immigrants worried about deportation, cannot afford.\n\n\u201cHe has the privilege of constructing a world in which very little of what he doesn\u2019t have to deal with gets through,\u201d said his sister, Bonnie Hagerman. \u201cThat\u2019s a privilege. We all would like to construct our dream worlds. Erik is just more able to do it than others.\u201d\n\nWhat if, he began to think, he could address his privilege, and the idea of broader good, near to home?\n\nHe has a master project, one that he thinks about obsessively, that he believes can serve as his contribution to American society.\n\nHe calls it The Lake.\n\nAt the Lake\n\nOn a recent spookily warm day, Mr. Hagerman clambered up a steep bank of woods, pushing past vines and stepping past fallen logs.\n\nWide-eyed, giddy with excitement, he led the way to a flat stretch of brush where he spread his arms and began talking even faster than usual. \u201cThis is where we\u2019ll build a giant barn. It will feel like a cathedral. The cloister will be here,\u201d he said, making reference to Chartres, and Oxford, and the grandeur of medieval cathedrals.\n\nAbout nine months ago, he bought some 45 acres of land on the site of a former strip mine. The property, untouched for decades, has been reclaimed by nature \u2014 deer, beavers, salamanders and canopies of majestic trees are thriving.\n\nWe walked further to the edge of a steep drop-off. Below, a bright blue lake shimmered in the February heat like a secret. He\u2019ll debate as long as you want whether the body of water counts as a lake or a pond. It\u2019s easier if you just agree it\u2019s a lake.\n\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe how great it feels to go swimming there,\u201d he said. He added, with almost rapturous glee, that the lake sits in the spot where the mining company dug deepest.\n\nImage Mr. Hagerman chats with Gary Conley, left, a landscape ecologist working with him to conserve wetland habitats on his property outside Athens. Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times\n\nImage Mr. Conley holds a juvenile salamander from a vernal pool. Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times\n\nMr. Hagerman sees this land as his life\u2019s work. He plans to restore it, protect it, live on it and then preserve it for the public. \u201cI will never sell this land,\u201d he said.\n\nHe wouldn\u2019t put it exactly this way, but he talks about the land in part as penance for the moral cost of his Blockade. He has come to believe that being a news consumer doesn\u2019t enhance society. He also believes that restoring a former coal mine and giving it to the future does.\n\n\u201cI see it as a contribution that has civic relevance that aligns with my passions and what I do well,\u201d Mr. Hagerman said. \u201cI\u2019m going to donate it. It\u2019s going to take most of my net worth. That\u2019s what I\u2019m going to spend the rest of my money on.\u201d\n\nHe has filled an entire room of his house with a 3-D rendering of the property to better envision his plans. He has hired Gary Conley, a local landscape ecologist, to advise on the project. Mr. Conley, a gentle bearded outdoorsman who can speak at length about the preferences of the local amphibians, believes that the land could become something special.\n\nMr. Conley indulges Mr. Hagerman\u2019s fantasies for the land \u2014 a walkway modeled on an ancient Mayan ballgame! Land art inspired by \u201cSpiral Jetty\u201d! Windows and concrete blocks, so many blocks! \u2014 but Mr. Conley mainly serves as the straight man to inject ecological reality into the plan.\n\nMr. Conley respects The Blockade. After all, the project of The Lake might not exist without it.\n\nImage Credit Damon Winter/The New York Times\n\nIn those carefree pre-Trump days, Mr. Hagerman would settle into the coffee shop with his newspaper and dig in. But after The Blockade, he could only read the weather \u2014 \u201cFor elderly men it\u2019s endlessly interesting\u201d \u2014 and the real estate listings.\n\nIt was during one of those long boring mornings, with no news to read, that he found the listing for The Lake.\n\n\u201cThe first time I saw it, I said, \u2018This is it,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nOrder Reprints | Today\u2019s Paper | Subscribe A version of this article appears in print on , on Page ST 1 of the New York edition with the headline: The Man Who Knew Too Little\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "keywords": ["coffee", "days", "mr", "man", "knew", "hagerman", "credit", "blockade", "winterthe", "damon", "little", "york"], "polarity": 0.08558744916699461, "subjectivity": 0.41289802369347806},

President Trump was a vocal critic of the deal during his presidential campaign, and while in office, he has consistently blamed CNN, a channel owned by Turner and part of Time Warner\u2019s television business, for unfair coverage of his administration.\n\nAT&T originally argued to the court that the Justice Department\u2019s suit was a case of \u201cselective enforcement\u201d \u2014 that the government was essentially blocking the deal because the president was against it.\n\nBut late last month, Judge Richard J. Leon, who is overseeing the trial, rejected demands by AT&T for detailed email and phone logs between the White House and the Justice Department related to the deal.

Rivals such as Comcast, Dish and Sony are expected to be called as witnesses to reveal details about their business dealings with AT&T and Time Warner in the past. The Justice Department is expected to argue that a combined AT&T and Time Warner would have the incentive to make it harder for competing media companies to distribute their programming through AT&T, and for Time Warner brands to limit their distribution outside of AT&T.\n\nThe Justice Department will also present economic analysis suggesting that the new company is likely to raise prices for consumers.\n\n\u201cAs will be shown at trial, the government is challenging this merger to address the real concerns of real people who populate the real marketplace today,\u201d the Justice Department said in its brief.\n\nAT&T said it would challenge the government\u2019s arguments that the merger would increase consumer prices and hamper competition by raising licensing fees for Time Warner content.

About 100 readers responded. Here are a selection of them, lightly edited for clarity and length.\n\n\u201cThe Brothers Garcia\u201d on Nickelodeon. It was my happiest TV day ever! The family on TV looked and acted very much like mine, and everybody at school loved it! The show gave me the \u201cendorsement\u201d I had been craving all my (short) life.\n\n\u2014 Alex Gonzalez\n\nThe first time I saw myself on the big screen was when \u201cGone With the Wind\u201d came out and had Hattie McDaniel as the maid. I am 74 years old and I have seen a lot of racism in my life but \u201cGone With the Wind\u201d was the worst. It depicted a black women as a slave, who at the same time had power. At the time of the film I didn\u2019t really understand a lot about racism and the fact that I was a second-class person. A lot has changed, but a lot has not.\n\n\u2014 Gwendolyn Morgan\n\nI always liked \u201cIn the Heat of the Night\u201d because as a well-spoken, professional black man, I have found myself in Sidney Poitier\u2019s character\u2019s position: People can\u2019t figure me out. Like when someone asks Poitier: \u201cWhy are you wearing white man\u2019s clothes?\u201d I get that look today sometimes!\n\n\u2014 Andre Graves\n\nI first saw black actors who made an impression on me during the 1970s era of Blaxploitation films. \u201cShaft,\u201d \u201cSuperfly,\u201d Pam Grier, etc ... They looked like people in my St. Albans and Jamaica, Queens, neighborhood.\n\n\u2014 DeBorah Palmer\n\nI remember watching \u201cMulan,\u201d which came out when I was in middle school, and absolutely freaking out. I\u2019m not Chinese; I\u2019m Korean and was adopted by a white family as a baby, but in a media landscape that still largely excludes people of East Asian descent, I\u2019ll celebrate what I can get.\n\n\u2014 Amanda McClendon\n\nI\u2019m a white woman. Moira Shearer in \u201cRed Shoes.\u201d I was perhaps 8 years old. I grew up in a small town in North Texas. As a child I loved \u201cSong of the South\u201d and had read \u201cUncle Remus\u201d before I saw it. I know it\u2019s not politically correct now, but this film mirrored the kindness, warmth and wisdom I received as a child from African-Americans who worked in our house.\n\n\u2014 Mavis Bryant\n\nAs a black South African, and an African in particular, I felt a deep sense of joy at how \u201cBlack Panther\u201d tried to portray African culture.

As someone adopted from China and raised in a predominantly white town, \u201cMulan\u201d was my premier exposure to Asian beauty and culture. Her story\u2019s message about turning adversity into strength sticks with me always.\n\n\u2014 MaiLei Meyers\n\nThe first time I saw gay men represented in film, who felt real and relatable, was in \u201cMy Beautiful Laundrette.\u201d Being gay isn\u2019t what the movie was about, these two characters just were, and that one was brown and the other white and working class made it even better.\n\n\u2014 Michael Ginther\n\n\u201cDrumline,\u201d featuring Nick Cannon, in 2002 and \u201cYou Got Served\u201d in 2004.

It made me want to cry with relief.\n\n\u2014 Dawn Reed\n\nGrowing up Italian and plus-size, I never saw women like me in the movies. The closest thing to representation I saw was \u201cThe Godfather,\u201d but my family wasn\u2019t violent or in organized crime so I couldn\u2019t relate. I\u2019m still waiting to see characters like me.\n\n\u2014 Tiffany Magazzeni\n\nI\u2019m still waiting to see myself. I mean there is Michelle Yeoh, an Asian actress in the 1997 movie \u201cTomorrow Never Dies.\u201d She\u2019s not me, but I loved that her character defies the usual Hollywood stereotypes for Asians. But she is not American and I\u2019m not at all a Bond woman. I grew up watching movies and I love the old Hollywood movies especially, but it makes me sad to realize that Hollywood\u2019s portrayal of Asians has been mocking or missing for most of its history. Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan are also imports. There just aren\u2019t any homegrown Asian-American filmmakers yet.\n\n\u2014 Lillian Hsu\n\nI am an African-American man born in 1960, raised in Southern California. The first time I remember seeing someone who looked like me represented on screen in the way I saw myself was in 1967.

Through some common coming-of-age feelings of loneliness and confusion, but also in better understanding the differences, I learned more about myself.\n\n\u2014 Sally Otis\n\nAlthough I am white, I am Jewish with \u201cbig\u201d hair, raised in the Bronx. I saw myself reflected in \u201cFunny Girl.\u201d With a New York City backdrop, song lyrics and Barbra Streisand\u2019s delivery, I felt for the first time, in the eyes of the larger world, at age 12, accepted.\n\n\u2014 Jill Sager\n\nImage Diahann Carroll and Sidney Poitier in \"Paris Blues.\" Credit Kino Lorber\n\nI am 70 years old and watched classic Hollywood movies on television during the 1950s and \u201960s.

Long-deferred network maintenance has led to breakdowns, track deterioration and multiple disasters, including a 2009 collision that killed nine people. The busiest route, the Red Line, \u201cleaks like a sieve, and whenever it rains, you get puddles and the wires fall into the puddles and they catch fire and you get smoke incidents,\u201d Mr. Evans said. \u201cNobody wants to hear that.\u201d\n\nThere have been some improvements. In 2017, Metro wrapped up a yearlong, $150 million maintenance blitz aimed at bringing its infrastructure back from the brink of collapse. Metro officials say the program, SafeTrack, was successful, and has made the system significantly less dangerous and more reliable.\n\nStill, Metro\u2019s general manager, Paul Wiedefeld, told the board of directors last year that the system needed $15.5 billion in long-term funding just to maintain the subpar status quo.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re on the right track now, but it\u2019s going to take a lot of work and a lot of money,\u201d Mr. Evans said, adding that the District, Maryland and Virginia are nearing a deal to supply $500 million annually in funding to Metro, which is what the transit authority says it needs to improve reliability and safety.

He argued that biological differences and not a lack of opportunity explained the shortage of women in leadership and technical positions.\n\nGoogle fired Mr. Damore. He filed a lawsuit in January with another former employee, claiming that the company discriminates against white men with conservative views. In a separate lawsuit, a former recruiter for YouTube sued Google because, he said, he was fired for resisting a mandate to hire only diverse \u2014 female or black and Latino \u2014 candidates.\n\nGoogle\u2019s handling of the issue was also upsetting to Mr. Damore\u2019s critics. In another lawsuit filed last month, a former Google employee said he was fired because he was too outspoken in advocating diversity and for spending too much time on \u201csocial activism.\u201d\n\nInside Google, vocal diversity proponents say they are the targets of a small group of employees who are sympathetic to Mr. Damore. In some cases, screenshots of comments made on an internal social network were leaked to online forums frequented by right-wing groups, which searched for and published personal information like home addresses and phone numbers of the Google employees, they said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn 2015, Google started an internal program called Respect@, which includes a way for employees to anonymously report complaints of inappropriate behavior by co-workers. Some diversity supporters say other employees are taking advantage of this program to accuse them of harassment for out-of-context statements.\n\n\u201cSome people feel threatened by movements that promote diversity and inclusion. They think it means people are going to come for their jobs,\u201d said Liz Fong-Jones, a Google engineer who is a vocal supporter of diversity.\n\nMany big tech companies are struggling with the challenge of creating a more diverse work force. In 2015, Facebook adopted the so-called Rooney Rule. Originally used by the National Football League to prod teams to consider coaching prospects who are black, the rule requires managers to interview candidates from underrepresented backgrounds for open positions. But last year, Facebook\u2019s female engineers said that gender bias was still a problem and that their work received more scrutiny than men\u2019s work.\n\nEven executives tasked with promoting diversity have had difficulties. In October, Denise Young Smith, who was Apple\u2019s vice president of inclusion and diversity, came under fire when she said that there was diversity even among 12 white, blue-eyed, blond men because they had different backgrounds and experiences. She later apologized, saying she did not intend to play down the importance of a non-homogenous work force. She left Apple in December.\n\nThe tension is elevated at Google, at least in part, by its workplace culture. Google has encouraged employees to express themselves and challenge one another. It provides many communication systems for people to discuss work and nonwork related issues. Even topics considered out of bounds at other workplaces \u2014 like sharp criticism of its own products \u2014 are discussed openly and celebrated.\n\nIn January, on one of Google\u2019s 90,000 \u201cgroups\u201d \u2014 internal email lists around a discussion topic \u2014 an employee urged colleagues to donate money to help pay Mr. Damore\u2019s legal fees from his lawsuit against Google to promote \u201cviewpoint diversity,\u201d according to a person who saw the posting but is not permitted to share the information publicly.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He said he had meant that being a Republican did not exempt Google employees from following the company\u2019s code of conduct.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA Google spokeswoman said in a statement that the company encouraged lively debate. But there are limits.\n\n\u201cCreating a more diverse workplace is a big challenge and a priority we\u2019ve been working to address. Some people won\u2019t agree with our approach, and they\u2019re free to express their disagreement,\u201d said the spokeswoman, Gina Scigliano. \u201cBut some conduct and discussion in the workplace crosses a line, and we don\u2019t tolerate it. We enforce strong policies, and work with affected employees, to ensure everyone can do their work free of harassment, discrimination and bullying.\u201d\n\nIn the past, discussions about diversity in Google\u2019s online chat groups would encounter skeptical but subtle comments or questions. The debate turned openly antagonistic after Mr. Damore\u2019s memo, which was titled \u201cGoogle\u2019s Ideological Echo Chamber.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe James Damore thing brought everything to a head,\u201d said Vicki Holland, a linguist who has worked at Google for seven years. \u201cIt brought everything to the surface where everyone could see it.\u201d\n\nMr. Damore said he began to question Google\u2019s diversity policies at a weekly company meeting last March. At the meeting, Ruth Porat, the chief financial officer of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, and Eileen Naughton, Google\u2019s vice president of people operations, \u201cpointed out and shamed\u201d departments in which women accounted for less than half the staff, according to Mr. Damore\u2019s lawsuit.\n\nThe two female executives \u2014 who are among the company\u2019s highest-ranking women \u2014 said Google\u2019s \u201cracial and gender preferences were not up for debate,\u201d according to the lawsuit. Mr. Damore subsequently attended a \u201cDiversity and Inclusion Summit,\u201d where it reinforced his view that Google was \u201celevating political correctness over merit\u201d with its diversity measures.\n\nMr. Damore said he had written his memo afterward in response.\n\nMs. Scigliano, the Google spokeswoman, said the company looked forward to fighting Mr. Damore\u2019s lawsuit in court. Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, said in an August blog post that he had fired Mr. Damore because his memo advanced \u201charmful gender stereotypes\u201d but that \u201cmuch of the memo is fair to debate.\u201d\n\nSome employees said they were abstaining from internal debate on sensitive issues because they worried that their comments might be misconstrued or used against them. Like the broader internet, the conversations tend to be dominated by the loudest voices, they said.\n\nGoogle\u2019s diversity advocates said they would like to see more moderation on internal forums with officials stepping in to defuse tensions before conversations get out of hand. Ms. Miller, the Coworker.org co-director, said Google employees had expressed concern about how this would affect an internal culture rooted in transparency and free expression.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s on everyone\u2019s mind is: Has the culture been inextricably damaged by this environment?\u201d she said.", "keywords": ["mr", "googles", "diversify", "work", "hard", "fired", "internal", "diversity", "lawsuit", "google", "trying", "damore", "employees"], "polarity": 0.08552789802789805, "subjectivity": 0.3460065686628187},

In announcing the batches of approvals, Ms. DeVos noted only that they complied with the law.\n\nMs. DeVos had signaled unwavering support for the autonomy under the ESSA law, and even issued a pared-down template for states to complete following a vote by Congress last year to rescind regulations that specified accountability measures in the law.

Having built its North Korea policy on sanctions and threats of military action, the administration must now learn the language of engagement.\n\nIt also served as a reminder of how many hurdles lie ahead before Mr. Trump\u2019s spontaneous decision on Thursday afternoon leads to a meticulously staged meeting between the American president and the dictator who rules the world\u2019s most reclusive country.\n\n\u201cNorth Korean offers typically come with caveats and asterisks that need to be examined,\u201d said Daniel R.

The White House, they said, has invested more in sanctions and military options than in diplomacy. Officials there have in the past expressed frustration about what they viewed as the Pentagon\u2019s reluctance to provide options for a military strike on the North.\n\nWith all the potential traps and internal misgivings, some officials said they believed the chances of a meeting between the two leaders actually happening were less than 50 percent.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s decision stunned allies and his own advisers, not least Secretary of State Rex W.

Gen. H. R. McMaster \u2014 expressed concerns about a meeting, according to a senior official. But nobody vocally opposed it.\n\nMr. Trump also had to mollify a rattled ally, Japan, which got no advance notice of his decision. In a call, the president reassured Prime Minister Shinzo Abe that the United States would not ease its pressure campaign on North Korea. Mr. Abe, officials said, asked for a meeting with him.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s call on Friday morning with President Xi Jinping of China was more relaxed. The Chinese have long called for direct talks between the United States and North Korea. American officials said they expected that Mr. Xi would offer Beijing as a venue for the meeting.\n\nThe location is one of a number of unresolved issues, including the size and composition of the delegations and the agenda. Some officials said Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim would set a broad framework for the talks, and leave the actual negotiating to subsequent sessions with lower-level officials. Even the logistical issues might require a couple of preliminary meetings, they said.\n\nStill, the lack of direct communication between Pyongyang and Washington was a yellow light to some experts. The two countries communicate through independent channels, one of which \u2014 the \u201cNew York Channel\u201d \u2014 goes through North Korea\u2019s mission to the United Nations.\n\nIn recent months, these channels have been used mostly for communications about Americans detained in North Korea. Mr. Yun, the former State Department negotiator, used such a channel to negotiate the return of Otto F. Warmbier, the college student from Cincinnati who suffered an irreversible brain injury while held in prison in Pyongyang.\n\nAt some point, officials said, they expected North Korea to send a message about the Trump-Kim meeting through one of the channels. The administration will parse it carefully to assess if it aligns with the message brought to Washington by the South Korean envoys.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s president, Moon Jae-in, has tried tirelessly to broker a meeting between American and North Korean officials. He sent his envoys \u2014 Chung Eui-yong, the national security adviser, and Suh Hoon, the director of the intelligence service \u2014 to the White House almost immediately after they returned from their meeting with Mr. Kim in Pyongyang.\n\nThe message from the envoys, American officials said, was that the economic sanctions had really crippled the North.

The Baptist part is inherited, like baldness or dimples: Both of my grandfathers and three of my uncles were Baptist preachers, and my parents met as graduate students at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. Genes aside, the church \u2014 plastic chairs, pilling carpet and grape juice for communion \u2014 was the organizing institution of my childhood, where I met my closest friends and most of the significant adults in my life.\n\nChurch attendance has been in generational decline. I began calling around, exploring whether people in small towns were looking for community elsewhere and, with the white nationalist rallies so often in the news, whether young white people were looking for meaning in the grim sanctuaries of the alt-right.\n\nBut I kept hearing about something different. Pastors, theologians and sociologists were talking of how black worshipers were leaving white-majority churches. They were leaving quietly and not en masse, a family here, a single person there. But it was happening everywhere, a movement large enough for some to see the unraveling of decades of efforts at racial reconciliation.\n\nI would find someone on Facebook, a black worshiper who had posted about leaving her mostly white church, and then I would find someone in the same situation halfway across the country. They would both think they were going through this alone, yet the accounts would be remarkably similar, the timelines nearly identical, even some of the words and phrases the same. There had been, I discovered, some sharp reporting about this, particularly from the writer Deborah Jian Lee, but not as much as you would expect for an experience that seemed to be this broadly shared.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPeople spoke to me of being tired, let down, heartbroken. Political and cultural partitions that they had long overlooked at worship time now overshadowed every service. The realizations almost always began with the death of Trayvon Martin in 2012, and a sense that white church leaders or fellow worshipers did not want to talk about how a black teenager walking home from a 7-Eleven could end up dead.

Progress is less about understanding and liking each other and more about smashing structures that others defend.\n\nThe second thing that happened was that reason, apparently, ceased to matter. Today\u2019s young people were raised within an educational ideology that taught them that individual reason and emotion were less important than perspectivism \u2014 what perspective you bring as a white man, a black woman, a transgender Mexican, or whatever.\n\nThese students were raised with the idea that individual reason is downstream from group identity.

The powerful few keep everyone else down. The solutions to injustice and suffering are simple and obvious: Defeat the powerful. Passion is more important than reason because the oppressed masses have to mobilize to storm the barricades. Debate is counterproductive because it dilutes passion and sows confusion. Discordant ideas are not there to inform; they are there to provide cover for oppression.\n\nSome people I admire see today\u2019s student mobbism as an outbreak of an ersatz religion, but I\u2019d say their theory of social change is at least comprehensible given the era they inhabit.\n\nIf I could talk to the students I\u2019d try to persuade them that mistake theory is a more accurate and effective way to change the world than conflict theory, but I probably wouldn\u2019t persuade them.\n\nSo I\u2019d just ask them to take two courses.

I discovered the story of Mary Ewing Outerbridge when I stumbled upon a website crediting her with introducing tennis to America. I wondered if she had received a Times obituary when she died in 1886. I checked our digital newspaper archives. She had not.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter that, anytime I came across an interesting person who died years ago, I searched our archives for an obit. Those who didn\u2019t get one were, not surprisingly, largely women and people of color. I started talking about my research with colleagues, friends and relatives, all of whom began sending me more names.\n\nI soon had a list of dozens of fascinating people, such as Ms. Larsen; Madhubala, a Bollywood actress whose poetically tragic life was cut short; and Margaret Abbott, a golfer who died without ever knowing that she was the first American woman to win an Olympic championship.\n\nEven more surprising were some blatant omissions of those who had achieved a measure of fame in their lifetime, like the poet Sylvia Plath, the writer Charlotte Bront\u00eb and the photographer Diane Arbus.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t they get obits? I can only speculate. Perhaps the mark they made on the world wasn\u2019t recognized until decades after their deaths. Or maybe some of them faded into obscurity, their achievements forgotten. It could be that The Times didn\u2019t learn about their deaths until it was too late. Or that the omission was more purposeful, a judgment call of an editor who didn\u2019t deem the death newsworthy.\n\nRegardless, I now had an opportunity to give these women their due.\n\nIn November 2017, I met Jessica Bennett, The Times\u2019s first gender editor. She agreed that Overlooked was a compelling way to add to the record, and we decided to partner up.\n\nWhat followed was a whirlwind of excitement in the newsroom, with writers, editors, international correspondents, page designers, photo editors \u2014 whether they were women, men, people of color or not \u2014 asking us how they could contribute. Dozens of people have played a meaningful role in making it come together.\n\nBecause many of the subjects we wrote about died long ago, we decided to diverge from the traditional obituary style of announcing a person\u2019s death at the start of the article. Instead, we encouraged writers to be creative with their storytelling.\n\nThis series is just the beginning. I\u2019m hopeful it will inspire many more conversations inside the newsroom and beyond about diversity and what we can do to make sure no one is overlooked.\n\nIf you would like to suggest someone who has been overlooked, please fill out this form.", "keywords": ["obits", "times", "died", "woman", "overlooked", "project", "wondered", "world", "tennis", "women", "born", "writers", "editor", "didnt"], "polarity": 0.18925070028011204, "subjectivity": 0.46301353874883283},

We also do our own homework: We investigate, research and ask around before settling on our subjects.\n\nSome might think our process presumptuous. Who, after all, anointed a handful of Times editors to stand by the roadside as a parade of humanity passes and single out this one, this one \u2014 but not that one \u2014 as worthy of being remembered?\n\nThe answer is that no one did, actually, because that is not precisely what we decide. We make no judgments, moral or otherwise, about human worth. What we do try to judge, however, is newsworthiness, and that\u2019s a whole other standard.\n\nPhoto\n\nThere is no formula, scoring system or checklist. But we do hold to certain criteria, slippery as they may be. Fame, of the widespread kind, will usually get someone past the velvet ropes. Accomplishment, with wide impact, matters as much, and it often goes hand in hand with fame.\n\nBut achievement may also speak softly. Eugene Goldwasser, to name one subject among 1,195 Times obits in 2010, was a largely unsung biochemist whose 20-year pursuit of an elusive protein led to the development of a widely used anemia drug that became one of the biggest products of the biotechnology industry.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWangari Maathai was a Kenyan environmentalist who began a movement to reforest her country by paying poor women a few shillings to plant trees. She might have died in 2011 largely unknown to the wider world had she not become the first African woman to win a Nobel Peace Prize seven years before.\n\nSometimes we choose a subject in part to represent a group whose contributions were forgotten or ignored. Violet Cowden, who also died in 2011, comes to mind: She helped ferry supplies for American troops in World War II as a member of the stateside Women Airforce Service Pilots.\n\nFor every person we decide to write about there are innumerable others we decide against. Fame and accomplishment are relative; the public eye is easily distracted, and only a moment or two in its fickle gaze may not be enough to merit a backward look in The Times.\n\nThe same might be said of a sparkling r\u00e9sum\u00e9. The best schools, a successful corporate climb, charitable good works and distinguished service awards are impressive and laudable, but not necessarily newsworthy to a global audience.\n\nOne thing to remember is that it is not our intent to honor the dead; we leave the tributes to the eulogists. We seek only to report deaths and to sum up lives, illuminating why, in our judgment, those lives were significant. The justification for the obituary is in the story it tells.\n\nMany readers legitimately ask: Why are the vast majority of our obituary subjects white men? The answer lies in our not-so-distant history.\n\nUnlike the rest of the newsroom, the obituaries desk covers the past, not the present. Our pages mirror the world of 1975 or 1965 or 1955, or even earlier: They\u2019re a rearview mirror, reflecting the world as it was, not as it is, and not as we might wish it to have been.\n\nAnd so we are, inevitably, a generation or three behind in tracking the evolution of gender and racial dynamics, among other things. The prominent shapers of society back then, those who held (and didn\u2019t easily give up) the levers of power, were disproportionately white and male, be they former United States senators or business titans or Hollywood directors.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWith Overlooked, our new collection of obituaries for women and others who never got them, The Times is acknowledging that many worthy subjects were skipped for generations, for whatever reasons.\n\nConscious or unconscious bias? Could be. Perhaps my predecessors and I were never informed of the deaths. Maybe those who knew the deceased did not think we\u2019d be interested. Maybe an editor passed for lack of interest, or maybe considered an obit but did not have a reporter available to write it. (A practical reality that bedevils us today.)\n\nPerhaps the significance of an individual portrayed in Overlooked was not fully recognized until decades after her death. Or perhaps the paper\u2019s selection standards in eras past unfairly valued the achievements of the white, male mainstream over those of minorities and women who may have been more on the margins.\n\nI\u2019d like to think that those portrayed in Overlooked would be prime candidates for an obit in The Times today \u2014 precisely because they fit a broader standard of significance and impact and, by the way, offer compelling stories.\n\nSo why not more women and people of color on the obituary pages? (Why, for that matter, not more openly gay people, or transgender people?)\n\nThe larger answer: Because relatively few of them were allowed to make such a mark on society in their own time. Universities may have barred them. Businesses and political parties may have shut them out. The tables of power were crowded with white men; there were few seats for anyone else.\n\nThere were, of course, women who crashed glass ceilings, blacks and Native Americans and people of Asian heritage who pushed through \u201cwhites only\u201d barriers. And their stories have been told in the obituary pages over many decades.\n\nNo doubt, we\u2019ll see more of them in the years to come. As time goes on, I imagine that their stories will be increasingly framed not by broken barriers but simply by what they built, unencumbered by the dead weights of discrimination.", "keywords": ["white", "desk", "maybe", "pages", "death", "times", "past", "overlooked", "obituary", "obituaries", "world", "men", "women", "think"], "polarity": 0.10482996385058244, "subjectivity": 0.431367429821038},

Activism by high school students in response to recent school shootings has inspired interest in the generation younger than millennials. Credit Saul Martinez for The New York Times\n\nThe Pew Research Center announced last week that it will define people born between 1981 and 1996 as members of the millennial generation, embracing a slightly narrower range of years than the ones used by the United States Census Bureau. It would have been better, though, if it had announced the end of what I call the \u201cgeneration game\u201d \u2014 the insistence on dividing society into groups based on birth year and imputing different characteristics to each group.\n\nYes, limited insights can be gleaned from thinking of humans in terms of generations, but this ultimately does more harm than good by obscuring the individual factors that actually shape our attitudes, politics and opportunities.\n\nTo see what\u2019s wrong with the idea, take a look at American millennials. In seemingly endless essays in recent years, they\u2019ve been derided as lazy and narcissistic or defended as creative and committed to social change. But these all sound like characteristics that the old have ascribed to the young since the dawn of time. Similar terms were applied to the \u201cslacker\u201d Generation X and before that, the baby boomers.\n\nIt\u2019s true that the current cohort (the demographic term for a group of people born around the same time) of young people is different in important ways from earlier cohorts. It\u2019s more ethnically diverse, with a smaller proportion of whites and more of most other racial and ethnic groups. But diversity is a characteristic of a population, not, in most cases, of individuals. A relatively small proportion of millennials personally embody ethnic diversity in the sense of identifying with more than one race or ethnicity.\n\nMuch of the apparent distinctiveness of the millennial generation disappears when we look at individuals rather than aggregates. Black millennials, like their parents, overwhelmingly vote Democratic. By contrast, 41 percent of white millennials voted for Donald Trump in 2016. That\u2019s lower than the 58 percent of all white voters who went for Mr. Trump, but it makes more sense to attribute the difference to individual characteristics and experiences rather than a generational attitude.\n\nCompared to the population as a whole, a larger proportion of millennials are college-educated, and a smaller proportion live in rural areas. Like other urban and educated voters, urban and educated millennials tend to vote Democratic. Rural millennials, meanwhile, share many of the attitudes of older rural voters who voted for Mr. Trump.\n\nActivism by high school students in response to the Parkland, Fla., shooting has inspired interest in the generation younger than millennials, known as \u201cGen Z\u201d or \u201ciGen.\u201d A recent Washington Post essay declared: \u201cMillennials disrupted the system. Gen Z is here to fix the mess.\u201d It argued that members of this cohort \u201cvalue compromise\u201d as \u201ca byproduct of their diversity and comfort with working with peers from different backgrounds.\u201d\n\nBut given that public schools have been resegregating for decades, to assume that the demographic makeup of a generation would have a meaningful impact on most individual Gen Z members\u2019 experiences with diversity seems misguided.\n\nAlthough much of its current popularity can be traced to the influential 1991 book \u201cGenerations\u201d by Neil Howe and William Strauss, generational thinking dates back to the second half of the 19th century. Sarah Laskow of The Atlantic explained in 2014 that philosophers at this time were, in the words of the sociologist Karl Mannheim, \u201canxious to find a general law to express the rhythm of historical development, based on the biological law of the limited lifetimes of man.\u201d /But understanding societal phenomena through the lens of groups of people born around the same time has always had its limits.\n\nFor example, it\u2019s true that for young men coming-of-age during the Vietnam War, being born in a particular year (and, thanks to the draft lottery, on a particular day) could be life-shaping. But even here, an individual\u2019s class was a factor in whether he actually went to war \u2014 men from privileged backgrounds had many options to avoid the draft, the burden of which fell mainly on the working class.\n\nLike war service, entering the labor market at a time of recession, as most millennials did, can be difficult. But race and class are more important in affecting how this experience plays out for individuals.\n\nTake white millennial college graduates: Yes, they\u2019re part of an age cohort that has experienced worse economic conditions than graduates of the preceding generation \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t give us a particularly meaningful understanding of their plight, given that they are still better off when it comes to income than the average non-college-educated worker of any age.\n\nSome may argue that the generation game, if intellectually vacuous, is basically harmless. But dividing society by generation obscures the real and enduring lines of race, class and gender. When, for example, baby boomers are blamed for \u201cruining America,\u201d the argument lumps together Donald Trump and a 60-year-old black woman who works for minimum wage cleaning one of his hotels.\n\nThe pattern of inherited privilege points to yet another reality that the generation game ignores: the decline of social mobility between generations and the rise of what the French economist Thomas Piketty has called a \u201cpatrimonial society.\u201d When it comes to wealth and its accompanying privileges, the wealth of the previous generation of one\u2019s own family matter more than whether your birth year falls on one or other side of some arbitrary boundary.\n\nToday\u2019s young people may choose political action aimed at reversing these trends or to let them continue and accelerate. But their choices will be determined by their political judgments and personal commitments, not by a number on a birth certificate.\n\nJohn Quiggin is a senior research fellow in economics at the University of Queensland.

Many Germans and Swedes now recognize \u2014 and some celebrate \u2014 the fact that their fellow citizens can have any skin color or religion. But the attempt to turn countries with monoethnic identities into truly multiethnic nations is a historically unique experiment, and so it should hardly come as a surprise that it has encountered some fierce resistance.\n\nThe situation in Canada and the United States, despite their histories as countries of immigration, has important similarities to that in Europe. Both have historically had rigid racial hierarchies. And in recent decades, both have made real steps toward overcoming these injustices: African-Americans, for example, are better represented in business and government than at any previous point in American history. This has made opposition to a more equal, multiethnic society more fervid among those who feel their privileges threatened. There is a sizable number of Americans for whom the idea of the nation remains synonymous with whiteness and Christianity.\n\nSo long as nationalism is associated with one particular ethnic or religious group, it will serve to exclude and disadvantage others. The only way to keep the destructive potential of nationalism in check is to fight for a society in which collective identity transcends ethnic and religious boundaries \u2014 one in which citizens from all religious or ethnic backgrounds are treated with the same respect as citizens from the majority group.\n\nTo effect this transformation is one of the great political challenges of our age. It requires principled resistance to right-wing nationalism, but it can succeed only if those who are most open to diversity abandon their hostility to other forms of nationalism.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

But for better or probably worse, it\u2019s easier to be moved by the suffering of people with whom we have some form of kinship. That is why nationalism remains one of the most powerful vehicles for expanding our circle of sympathy.\n\nAnother common reaction to the resurgence of nationalism has been to celebrate more narrow forms of collective identity, such as race or religion. At a time when many minority groups are under attack, it is, of course, crucial to defend them against discrimination. But it is also important to remember that such groups, too, are capable of oppressing their own members, for example by enforcing restrictive moral codes. That\u2019s why the only way to allow individuals true freedom to lead their lives is to preserve some form of political identity independent of the interests of particular cultural groups.\n\nConvinced that they would be unable to redirect nationalism toward their own ends, many of the most open-minded segments of society long ago gave up on the fight to determine its meaning. In countries like Germany and the United States, advocacy for the victims of prejudice has increasingly bled into a belief that the dark chapters of those countries\u2019 history make any form of nationalism deeply suspect. Instead of exhorting their fellow citizens to live up to their nations\u2019 highest ideals, many activists seem content with denouncing past and present injustices. This has allowed the bigots and racists to bend the meaning of the nation to their own sinister ends.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt\u2019s time to fight back. Nationalism can, and should, be reclaimed for liberals.\n\nA few political leaders have made a valiant start. Barack Obama has been an especially persuasive advocate of the idea that Americans should focus on what unites rather than what divides us and that the symbolism of the nation can inspire hope, even as we reckon with the injustices of American history. \u201cWhat greater expression of faith in the American experiment than this,\u201d Mr. Obama marveled as he stood on the spot in Selma, Ala. where civil rights protesters were beaten in 1965. \u201cWhat greater form of patriotism is there than the belief that America is not yet finished, that we are strong enough to be self-critical, that each successive generation can look upon our imperfections and decide that it is in our power to remake this nation to more closely align with our highest ideals?\u201d\n\nCampaigning for France\u2019s presidency last year, Emmanuel Macron expressed inclusive patriotism in an even more explicit form. \u201cI see Armenians, Italians, Algerians, Moroccans, Tunisians,\u201d he said at a rally in Marseille, a diverse city in southern France, \u201cBut what do I see? I see the people of Marseille! What do I see? I see the people of France!\u201d This, he added in an explicit repudiation of the exclusive nationalism propagated by the far-right National Front party, \u201cis what it means to be proud to be French!\u201d\n\nAmerican \u2014 and to a lesser degree European \u2014 political culture is pregnant with the symbols of inclusive patriotism. But while we have plenty of history to build on, we must also recognize that we are fighting to establish a kind of society for which there is no clear precedent.\n\nIn the United States, the model had once been a melting pot. But asking individuals to conform to one unified culture puts the price of admission to the nation too high. In Canada, the model is often said to be that of a salad bowl, in which the overall dish is enriched by the great variety of individual ingredients. But we can now see that this may be an overly idealized image of a society in which people feel that they have little in common across ethnic and religious divides.\n\nThere may not be a perfect culinary metaphor for the kind of country inclusive nationalists seek to create. But its contours should be obvious. It is a state in which all members have the same rights and opportunities irrespective of the group into which they are born or the culture to which they belong. It is a society in which people feel that they have something important in common because they seek to govern themselves together, pledge to help one another in an hour of need and recognize that these shared commitments are ultimately more consequential than any difference of color or creed. And it is a culture that does not shy away from celebrating the nobility of this collective identity \u2014 embracing the nation\u2019s flag not because we claim never to have failed our compatriots in the past but because we aspire to realize a common future fair to all.\n\nIt would be tempting to say that this kind of patriotism has little in common with the nationalism that is now ascendant around the world. Patriotism, some philosophers argue, should be understood as an innocent love of country that is inclusive at home and cooperative abroad. Nationalism, by contrast, excludes other ethnicities and stands in competition with the interests of other countries.\n\nBut it is too clever by half to pretend that we can safely stoke the good aspects of patriotism without ever running the danger of exacerbating the worst aspects of nationalism. For the kind of patriotism I am proposing is not a completely different form of collective identity; it is, rather, one that proudly stands in competition with the exclusionary politics on display from Washington to Moscow to Beijing.\n\nNationalism is like a half-wild beast. As long as it remains under our control, it can be of tremendous use. But if we abandon it, others are sure to step in, prodding and baiting the beast to bring out its most ferocious side. For all the well-founded misgivings about it, we have little choice but to domesticate it as best we can.", "keywords": ["reclaim", "form", "identity", "common", "patriotism", "political", "society", "religious", "liberals", "nationalism", "nation", "collective"], "polarity": 0.14129125602529854, "subjectivity": 0.47932204517310895},

But what I saw in Axel Foley, Eddie Murphy\u2019s character in \u201cBeverly Hills Cop,\u201d was a black man who was funny, charismatic, shrewd and in many ways a hero. Truthfully, Foley\u2019s race was not at the fore of my mind when I watched the show, but it was inspiring to see that a natural leader could look just like me.\n\n\u2014 John Eligon, race reporter, national news\n\nDays before the United States dropped bombs on Baghdad in January 1991, \u201cNot Without My Daughter,\u201d the crudest possible film portrait of Iraq\u2019s neighbor, Iran, was released. I was too young to fully understand this strange convergence of events. But I know now that they\u2019re linked for another reason: Hollywood\u2019s systemic demonization of Arabs, Persians and Muslims in general has made it much easier for Washington, the media and the public to start and support wars with no end in sight. And it\u2019s still the last place I\u2019d look for representation.\n\n\u2014 Adeel Hassan, editor, Race/Related\n\nFor more coverage of race, sign up to have our newsletter delivered weekly to your inbox.", "keywords": ["mirror", "white", "saw", "race", "hollywood", "character", "black", "credit", "movies", "men", "representation", "editor"], "polarity": 0.17698023252000528, "subjectivity": 0.3848821002230094},
{"title": "\n                    New Y.A. Books by Women of Color Rewrite Old Cultural Scripts                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/02/books/review/ya-women-of-color-clayton-adeyemi.html", "text": "Now, more than anytime in recent history, we\u2019re hearing the triumphant roar of women of color as they break down longstanding barriers in art, film and literature. In young adult literature in particular, inventive, international stories told in newly empowered women\u2019s voices are claiming their rightful place at the table. Take these five new Y.A. books, ranging from fantasy to realistic fiction to memoir. In these authors\u2019 hands, non-Western sensibilities might reign in a vivid and original Yoruban religion-based world, or classical settings might be reinterpreted to create a universe in which beauty is not tied to race. A heartbreaking fictional front row seat to the Syrian refugee emergency is offset by a humorous true tale of growing up an Iranian-American immigrant without a green card. And a very modern romance proves that, despite divides both cultural and digital, love still wins. So do Y.A. readers, when it comes to seeing exhilaratingly new kinds of characters sharing space.\n\nIn Dhonielle Clayton\u2019s lavish fantasy THE BELLES (Freeform, $17.99; ages 14 to 17), a thing of beauty is only temporary. The decadent island society of Orl\u00e9ans is home to a select group of sisters born with the disconcerting ability to perform plastic surgery without the plastic. As \u201cdescendants of the goddess of beauty,\u201d the Belles have a fuzzily explained magical \u201carcana\u201d in their blood that allows them to temporarily change the physical appearance of the native Gris, who are cursed with gray skin and red eyes. After a childhood of training, the teenage Belles are introduced to upper-class society and tasked with transforming the hair, skin and bone structure of the race-fluid rich and royal. But when the rebellious Belle Camellia uncovers a plot by the truly vile Princess Sophia to enslave her and her sisters, she sows the seeds of a grass-roots revolution that is bound to blossom more fully in the inevitable sequel.\n\nPhoto\n\nClayton, a co-founder of the We Need Diverse Books organization, has created an opulent mash-up setting, which seems to be a cherry-picked combination of 18th-century France, Japan and the antebellum American South. If it never quite coalesces into a seamless cultural whole, readers seduced by the page-turning palace intrigue and the vivid food and clothing descriptions won\u2019t notice or care.\n\nMagic also lies dormant in the platelets of chosen teenagers in the Nigerian-American Tomi Adeyemi\u2019s debut, CHILDREN OF BLOOD AND BONE (Holt, $18.99; ages 12 and up). But these diviners are no debutantes. Born with snow white hair and deep brown skin in the imaginary country of Or\u00efsha, young diviners morph into mighty, magic-wielding maji, or magicians, at 13. For centuries they relied on their powers (which Adeyemi based on aspects of the religion of the Yoruban people of West Africa). All that ended when the nonmagical King Saran ordered the slaughter of all adult majis. But when a mysterious scroll falls into the hands of Amari, a defiant princess, and Z\u00e9lie, a tenacious diviner warrior, the two young women set out on a thrilling, death-defying journey to restore magic and take back the throne.\n\nPhoto\n\nBlack Girl Magic, indeed! It\u2019s no surprise that this epic trilogy opener has already been optioned for film. Full of cinematic action sequences (the most memorable of them set almost entirely underwater and employing an army of the dead) and creatures worthy of Star Wars (horse-size \u201clionaires\u201d have saber teeth and horns), it storms the boundaries of the imagination. Yet it also confronts the conscience. Adeyemi\u2019s brutally depicted war between the noble, lighter-skinned kosidans and the enslaved, darker-skinned majis poses thought-provoking questions about race, class and authority that hold up a warning mirror to our sharply divided society.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Tareq is a Syrian refugee whose perilous journey is narrated by the voice of Destiny, characterized as a kindly, prosaic entity. After Tareq\u2019s mother, grandmother and four of his siblings are killed by a bomb, he and his father flee to Turkey with his remaining sister, Susan. They hopscotch from Turkey to Greece, Serbia, Slovenia, Austria and finally to Germany, where he finds a fragile safety. Along the way he witnesses beheadings and drownings, but also experiences the kindness of aid workers like Alexia, an American student. Abawi, a foreign news correspondent, does an admirable job of showing the grim horror of refugee life. But her efforts are occasionally undermined by cartoonish villains (\u201cYou tink you will be saved? Who will save you? Captain America is not real, just movies\u201d) and by some of Destiny\u2019s well-meaning but obvious platitudes: \u201cWhen you truly love someone, their life means more to you than your own.\u201d These interruptions may pull readers out of the story, though perhaps that distance is necessary for adolescents trying to process something as bleak and overwhelming as the Syrian refugee crisis.\n\nPhoto\n\nOf course, once refugees finally arrive in their adopted country, new problems arise. Until she was 13, Sara Saedi, an Iranian-American television writer and the author of the memoir AMERICANIZED: Rebel Without a Green Card (Random House, $17.99, ages 12 and up), was cheerfully oblivious of her family\u2019s immigration status. After her older sister breaks the news that they are \u201cillegal,\u201d Saedi suffers through the usual teenage rites of passage at her Silicon Valley high school (unibrow management, pimple wars, pot smoking) with the added pressure of possible deportation hanging over her head. Saedi adroitly and humorously uses these universal pubescent ordeals to contextualize Iranian culture and the immigrant experience. A memory of being teased about her eyebrow in ninth grade expands into a discussion of beauty norms: When her mother praises her for being hairless, \u201cshe meant by Persian woman standards. I was still hairy by everyone else\u2019s standards.\u201d And she has the sobering realization that pot is a privilege American teenagers can enjoy, but not undocumented kids: \u201cIf I got caught, I\u2019d have a criminal record that could be grounds for deportation.\u201d Very funny but never flippant, Saedi mixes \u201990s pop culture references, adolescent angst and Iranian history into an intimate, informative narrative that thoroughly defies current divisive views on immigration.\n\nPhoto\n\nMary H.K. Choi\u2019s blushingly tender and piquant debut novel, EMERGENCY CONTACT (Simon & Schuster, $17.99; ages 14 and up), about two isolated, misfit college students from Austin who fall in love via text message explores our emotional rather than geographical divides. In \u201cEmergency Contact,\u201d a Korean-American would-be writer named Penny keeps everyone at a distance, the result of living with a single, oversharing mom she calls \u201cthe equivalent of \u2026 human glitter.\u201d But when she rescues Sam, a half-German, half-Polish student filmmaker, from the sidewalk during a panic attack, she becomes his \u201cemergency contact,\u201d and he hers. Their charged, initial banter on text soon develops into increasingly personal exchanges about art, death, unstable moms and pregnant ex-girlfriends. Yet their burgeoning bond keeps stalling out. Burned by past relationships and millennial-ly tethered to their devices, they struggle to connect romantically IRL. Sam \u201ccouldn\u2019t imagine the space Penny would take up in his life if she sprang out of his phone,\u201d and Penny admits \u201cSam was her phone and her phone was Sam.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nChoi, a culture correspondent for HBO\u2019s Vice News, inserts timely issues like sexual assault, cultural appropriation and even DACA into her characters\u2019 intimate conversations, but it is her examination of digital vs. F2F communication that feels the most immediate.

Credit Fabio Frustaci/European Pressphoto Agency\n\nWith Europe\u2019s next major election set to take place in Italy on Sunday, fears that false information could mislead voters have again surfaced.\n\nMisinformation has thrived on social media, where it can be difficult to tell the difference between real and false quotes, images and articles.\n\nAnd with internet companies and governments struggling to keep up with the waves of false reports, politicians have expressed concern about how the misinformation might skew the voting process and stoke tensions.\n\nHere are examples of how false information has spread in Europe recently, polarizing opinions about contentious topics like Muslim immigration.\n\nA Czech Smear Campaign\n\nJiri Drahos was the main opponent of President Milos Zeman in the Czech presidential election in January.\n\nImage Jiri Drahos, left on the screen, and President Milos Zeman of the Czech Republic during a televised debate in January. Mr. Drahos was accused of collaborating with the secret police in the 1980s. He denied it. Credit David W Cerny/Reuters\n\nIn the summer of 2017, Aeronet News, a Czech news website that has been linked to fake news in the past and that has a distinctly pro-Russia bent, published an article insinuating that Mr. Drahos had committed acts of pedophilia and that he had collaborated with the secret police in the 1980s.\n\nAfter the article received lots of attention, Mr. Drahos released a statement on his website in which he denied the allegations, but the damage, it seems, had already been done.\n\nFalse Maps in France\n\nTwo months before the French presidential election of 2017, Bernard Barrier, who claimed to be a former employee of the French Ministry of Defense, posted a map that he said showed the locations of clashes between immigrants and the police.\n\nThe map was shared more than 15,600 times on Facebook. But it was later proved that the image had been taken from an article in the British newspaper The Daily Telegraph article, published in 2005, about riots mainly by mobs of young people from poor neighborhoods.\n\nImmigration played a crucial role in the campaigning, and Marine Le Pen, of the far-right National Front, made the final round of voting. But she was beaten by the center-right politician Emmanuel Macron.\n\nA Selfie Is Skewed in Germany\n\nChancellor Angela Merkel of Germany visited refugees in Berlin in 2015. While there, Anas Modamani, a Syrian refugee, took a selfie with her, which he then posted to his Facebook account.\n\nThen came the Brussels attacks in March 2016. When a photograph of the prime suspect was publicized, the selfie with Ms. Merkel, who had been under pressure for her open-door policy toward refugees, started circulating on social media \u2014 but with Mr. Modamani falsely identified as one of the bombers.\n\nImage Anas Modamani, a Syrian refugee, took a selfie with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany in 2015 in Berlin that was later used to spread fake news. Credit Fabrizio Bensch/Reuters\n\nMr. Modamani sued Facebook in an attempt to prevent its users from further reposting the picture, but he lost the case.\n\nPolice Violence in Spain\n\nOn the day in October that Catalan secessionists voted for independence from Spain, a Twitter account with the name Persian Rose shared a video that claimed to show violence by the Spanish police against voters in Catalonia.\n\nThe post received more than 3,900 retweets. Even though the video featured the unsavory actions of Spanish police officers, the footage had nothing to do with the vote in Catalonia.\n\nIt was about a general strike and was first posted to YouTube in 2012.\n\nPhoto Is Not All It Seems in Britain\n\nA few hours after a deadly terrorist attack on Westminster Bridge in London in March 2017, a post on Twitter accused a woman wearing a hijab of paying \u201cno mind to the terror attack\u201d and of \u201ccasually\u201d walking by a dying man.\n\nIt was quickly shared widely on social media.\n\nBut the moment described in the photograph was misrepresented and out of context. Twitter later identified the account, which at the time went by the description \u201cproud Texan and American patriot,\u201d as Russia-based.\n\nFears also persist that Russian interference played a role in Britain\u2019s vote in 2016 to leave the European Union.\n\nJustin Bank and Hana de Goeij contributed reporting.

She takes comfort from local efforts like a project in Utica, N.Y., where Bosnian Muslim immigrants and local Unitarian Christians watched a Super Bowl together. She applauds aggressive racial integration programs like those run by the American military. She cites her own teaching experience in small seminars at Yale, where students from divergent backgrounds overcame disagreements to achieve mutual respect, sometimes even friendship.\n\nPhoto\n\nYet the scholar in Chua acknowledges that these individual experiences offer less of a social lesson than she would wish.\n\n\u201cStudies show that minimal or superficial exposure to out-group members can actually worsen group division. \u2026 Negative interactions with people from other groups also increase group hostility. So merely putting members of different groups in the same space is not enough and indeed can aggravate political tribalism.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Chua falls back on the very attitude to which she turned her sharply skeptical gaze at the beginning of the book: the conviction that the United States was, is and will remain an exceptional nation, different from all the others. In her introduction, Chua remarked that the United States as a supertribal entity indifferent to ethnicity and culture became at best a partial reality only a generation ago. By book\u2019s end, however, the battered ideal has been polished and refurbished.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Will we, telling ourselves \u2018These immigrants are different,\u2019 be the weak link, the first generation to fail? Will we forget who we are?\u201d That\u2019s inspiring, and even more so are the citations of Martin Luther King Jr., Lin-Manuel Miranda and Langston Hughes that finish the book.\n\nInspiring \u2014 but not wholly reassuring. A lot of the interest of \u201cPolitical Tribes\u201d comes from the strong sense it emanates of an author arguing with herself. Chua both condemns tribalism and respects its power. She insists that the United States alone of nations among the earth has often transcended it \u2014 and then presents impressive contrary evidence from the past and the present. Chua reckons with the many tribalisms of the American past: ethnic, religious and racial. She hopes for a future in which tribalism fades \u2014 even as she mercilessly details its accumulating strength.\n\nAs Chua notes, tribes can coalesce out of previously unrelated pieces. Immigrants to Europe from North Africa, the Middle East and South Asia \u2014 of different languages, ethnicities, folkways and religious practices \u2014 raised children who created for themselves a new identity as post-ethnic Muslims. ISIS, as Chua mordantly observes, is in its own way a melting pot, bringing together young men and women from across Europe, Asia and the Americas to fight for a new ideology. She quotes a New York Times article about young British girls lured to ISIS. For them, \u201cIslam is punk rock.\u201d\n\nTribes can be created by fission as well as by fusion. Chua suggests that in the United States, divisions that would once have been understood as class divides have been reinterpreted in our time as cultural, even when they are not ethnic. \u201cWhite Americans often hold their biggest disdain for other white Americans \u2014 the ones on the opposite side of the cultural divide.\u201d\n\nThese fast-evolving and ever-changing identities may look contingent from the outside. They feel overwhelmingly powerful to those inside. Chua repeatedly scolds American policymakers for underestimating the importance of ethnocultural identity in Vietnam in the 1960s, Venezuela in the 1990s and Afghanistan in the 2000s. Through her book pulses an evident worry that tribal claims are now overpowering national ones within the United States. If she cannot quite bring herself to make her own anxieties explicit \u2014 or figure out what if anything to do to address them \u2014 she is hardly alone.

Otto Kerner of Illinois.\n\nPresident Lyndon Johnson had established the commission to examine the disorders and violent protests in Detroit, Newark and well over 100 other American cities during the summer of 1967, and earlier. What it found was searing. \u201cWhat white Americans have never fully understood \u2013 but what the Negro can never forget \u2013 is that white society is deeply implicated in the ghetto,\u201d the commission concluded. \u201cWhite institutions created it, white institutions maintain it, and white society condones it.\u201d\n\nMostly moderate and mostly white men, the members of the bipartisan panel carried the imprimatur of the political establishment. Their recommendations attracted widespread public debate. The paperback edition of the report sold over two million copies.\n\nOccupied by the Vietnam War and concerned about the legacy of his Great Society domestic agenda, Johnson distanced himself from the \u201ctwo societies\u201d warning. But the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Senator Robert Kennedy strongly endorsed the commission\u2019s findings and recommendations before they were assassinated and before more protests erupted during that traumatic year of 1968.\n\nThe Kerner Commission recommended \u201cmassive and sustained\u201d investments in jobs and education to reduce poverty, inequality and racial injustice.

I\u2019d love to jump right in and hear your aspirations for Prairie View. What do you hope to accomplish in your time as president? I assume you had many offers to lead other colleges. Why was Prairie View different?\n\nRuth Simmons: Well, I\u2019m a native of Texas, and one of the things that I did when I returned to Houston after I retired from Brown was think about the ways I could use my experience to help the community. I started with small ventures in the city, but I hadn\u2019t thought really that another university would be in my life. But when I was approached by Prairie View, I thought immediately about its significant impact on my brother, who went there. And what Dillard did for me.\n\nI grew up in a segregated neighborhood in Grapeland, Tex., with very little experience with the world. The transition that Dillard enabled for me was extremely valuable. As an undergraduate, I began to grow a sense of confidence that helped me move from a fairly insular environment to a bigger stage when I went to graduate school.\n\nMy aspirations for Prairie View are to essentially make sure the university is continuing to do the same thing for students today that it did for my brother \u2014 and Dillard did for me. And that is to offer the advantage of a strong education that will prepare students for the careers they want, in a social and cultural context that helps them develop the confidence to perform after graduation.\n\nAs president, that means focusing on time-honored strategies to success that apply to universities everywhere: worrying about the faculty who are recruited here, the campus experience, and whether we are providing the leadership and internship opportunities that students need. It means worrying about the reputation of the university. It\u2019s obviously a much more competitive world today than it was when I was a student, but the underlying work to move the university to a level of achievement that makes students and alumni proud is the same.\n\nM.J.: What do you see as some of the major challenges facing historically black colleges and universities?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nR.S.: The general challenge for H.B.C.U.s is not unlike the problem many universities face today, and that is the financial model. Being tuition dependent has become a large problem for all universities. H.B.C.U.s are dependent on raising money, but that is a reality that most universities obviously face. So it very much depends on the question of whether the schools have a good-enough foundation because of secure financing. When it comes to the federal government\u2019s role in supporting H.B.C.U.s, I think we don\u2019t yet understand the extent to which they will be affected by the changes in Washington today. To say that many are not hopeful in this moment is an understatement. We just don\u2019t know.\n\nFrankly, that\u2019s why I advocate for developing enough financial independence to secure the future of our institutions. That means looking for different revenue streams, looking to increase our ability to raise funds and finding alternate programs that help to bring more income into our university. The only strategy cannot be to persistently raise tuition, making college outside the reach of many families.\n\nM.J.: You\u2019ve led several institutions that are all very different from each other, and the topic of leadership is something you\u2019ve talked a lot about. In another interview with The Times you said that it\u2019s much easier to lead people \u201cif you convey the underlying principles.\u201d Can you elaborate?\n\nR.S.: One thing that I\u2019ve learned is that the perceptions of what it takes to be a leader are often based on prototypical models that don\u2019t have much truth in reality. People look at the institutions that I have led and they see dissimilarities. I see similarities. When people think in terms of leadership, they\u2019re often thinking about the kind of specific skills needed for different types of enterprises. I think of leadership as more of a disposition \u2014 the ability to step into a situation to learn about the history of the enterprise, the opportunities that it faces, the culture that exists and the people who are served by it. To look at all of that, to listen to stakeholders and then to think about how that enterprise or institution should best be served. There is no one model of leadership if you approach it that way. What I have tried to do wherever I go is to start where the institution is rather than try to import particularly rigid constructs from other places. In that sense, I think a leader is more than anything else a facilitator. A person who is able to come in to show a community a picture of what it is, to provide some insight into what it could be \u2014 how it could be different or improved perhaps \u2014 and then enlist the help of people who are there and others who support that institution in order to move forward together.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nI don\u2019t subscribe to the model of hero leadership, which is identifying somebody who can come in and have magical powers and then wield the wand and fix things that have not been fixable before. I don\u2019t see that. I think leadership is a community affair.\n\nM.J.: That makes sense. So how do you approach educating the current generation of students at Prairie View to lead in the way you described?\n\nR.S.: People today are fond of leadership programs that theorize about the profile and tenets of leadership. And students anxiously get involved in those programs. I rather think that our entire campuses are incubators of leadership even without the formality of such programs because if we\u2019re doing what we should be doing, we are acclimating students to an environment in which they have to learn to work with others who are very different from themselves. And that seems to me to be the first requirement of leadership. To actually learn to work with people in a respectful and inclusive way is inordinately important. A campus provides one of the best opportunities for people to be able to do that because you sit in class alongside people whom you initially don\u2019t know. You are discussing your ideas, having people respond to them and often rejecting what you\u2019re saying. You are joining organizations that have certain aims that are being advanced by the collective, so you\u2019re learning how to facilitate. You are asked to step into leadership roles either through student government or organizations. Even in the classroom context you might play a leadership role. You have to learn to express yourself, to be convincing, to write out your ideas, to be more thoughtful than you\u2019d ordinarily be. All of those things are components of leadership.\n\nM.J.: Some would argue that social media, or perhaps disagreements over the concept of safe spaces, have made it more challenging for people to come together and to work together.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nR.S.: Yeah, I would say that people frequently say that, but that has certainly not been my experience. I would say that in my days as a student, the tensions were higher, the disagreements were greater, the separation among us was certainly more pronounced. And people are kind of inventing a new narrative, that things are so much worse today than they were in the past. I don\u2019t buy that. I think we have new terminology, because the modern sciences of psychology and sociology and so forth and modern media have enabled us to peer into areas that we were not able to see as easily as before. And so when you have social media and all of the ways in which people can now say whatever they want to say \u2014 in an unartful or offensive way \u2014 that turns the volume up to be sure. But it doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t there before.\n\nI would say that the current situation ought to give us much more practice in how to engage with each other because it is not underground. It\u2019s out front, it\u2019s in the open. The media today and the things that are being reported should be upsetting or troubling to students, my goodness. But it may be an even better opportunity to engage students.\n\nAs a teacher, as an educator, I would say these times are especially fertile for teaching the skills that are needed in a world in which there are many types of people, many perspectives and so forth. Students don\u2019t need to feel silenced by the current situation. When students at Brown came to me and said, you know, they were hurt because somebody asked them about their hair, and they were tired of that and they didn\u2019t want any part of it, I would say, \u201cWell, that\u2019s just too bad!\u201d Somebody asked you about your hair, tell them about your hair. You are in college not to hide from that. You\u2019re there to teach the world about yourself, you\u2019re there to learn about others and to teach them about who you are. So I\u2019d rather think this whole notion of protecting people from that is something that we have to take in hand and deal with. And help students see the opportunity in that because if they engage with people who have those kinds of perspectives, they are going to be much stronger in the end than if they run away.\n\nM.J.: Do you see the situation differently for students at H.B.C.U.s? You mentioned that Dillard gave you the space to learn and build confidence before heading to graduate school.\n\nR.S.: There is a narrative that many people have for H.B.C.U.s. People see them as a monolith, or only see them as filling a gap that exists for African-Americans. H.B.C.U.s are not a brand. They are institutions with a certain history \u2014 they were originally set up basically to insure that there would be two separate systems for education \u2014 but they are not all alike, and are very diverse in what they offer.\n\nPrairie View, for example, is the second-oldest public institution of higher education in the state of Texas. It was set up basically to insure that there would be two separate systems for ex-slaves and whites. For a long time it provided educational opportunities for black students that wouldn\u2019t have been open to them otherwise. In nursing, architecture, engineering and other STEM fields at a time when many blacks were not able to go into those areas, the university was able to facilitate the entry of blacks into those professions.\n\nM.J.: Yes, this is something that Nikole Hannah-Jones has written about for The New York Times Magazine, in particular how Xavier University of Louisiana sends more black students to medical school than almost any other college in the country. I read that Prairie View has many more students who graduate with degrees in architecture and engineering.\n\nR.S.: Yes, going to Dillard is not like going to Prairie View. So the student who chooses to go to one H.B.C.U. may not find another appealing. That has to do with the unique features of the place, the academic culture and so on, the traditions. All of that makes a big difference.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen I went off to college, I was just trying to find a place where I could be a student without impediments that in that day and time were fairly widely known to be substantial if you enrolled in a majority-white institution. There was no question that in 1963, if you went off to college in the South, you had to be very careful about where you studied. The racial dynamic was very challenging at that time. One of the things I\u2019m learning now is that many of the students I speak to at Prairie View today have the same kinds of thoughts that I had those many years ago. They ask themselves, where can I feel comfortable so that I don\u2019t have to worry about anything but my academic work? So certainly that plays a factor in why students apply to H.B.C.U.s. And for some H.B.C.U.s, applications are way up. But if you reach the point where you think that a category of institutions are the right choice for you \u2014 going to an H.B.C.U. just to go to an H.B.C.U. \u2014 then you\u2019re not thinking broadly enough.\n\nM.J.: As you look across the landscape of higher education, what other challenges do college students face today?\n\nR.S.: I guess I worry a lot about our students having the skills and the experience to promote respectful interactions with a wide-ranging group of people. Students can be quite passionate about what they see on the national scene and how sometimes dangerous they think it is \u2014 how unpleasant it is and so forth. But we\u2019ve got to try to find a way on our campuses not to taint the national picture as hopeless, or as being antithetical to anything that we can think of as good and admirable. The last thing we want is for our students to bow out and decide that it isn\u2019t worth trying to do anything about a hopeless situation.\n\nAnd I do think that civility goes hand in hand with being hopeful. Hopeful that the next person you meet you will be able to converse with you in a respectful way. Hopeful that the next election cycle is going to give you a chance to be engaged and able to do something that makes you feel a sense of your own agency. Hopeful that the things will get better rather than worse.\n\nSo much of what we have to do on our campuses is really to hold open the possibility for people that civil society will in the end right itself \u2014 if enough of us are engaged. I am so thankful every day for the fact that I grew up in a time when nobody thought blacks would be able to be integrated into American society, they would never be able to hold important positions, they\u2019d never be respected intellectually, they\u2019d never be able to do the things that they are now able to do. So why did we persist? And why did we continue to work toward betterment? We did it because we had people working with us in education who were ever hopeful that things were going to change. So I like to say to educators, you have to be always projecting to students that civility enables hopefulness to be ever resurgent.", "keywords": ["today", "simmons", "think", "able", "students", "cultivating", "generation", "leadership", "view", "say", "things", "prairie", "dont", "ruth", "college"], "polarity": 0.18839701321015756, "subjectivity": 0.47766767453623127},

They are quiet, almost too much so. But once you learn what happened in these scenes from small towns, big cities or verdant fields, their almost unemotional first impression gives way to horror: Someone was lynched there.\n\nStarting in 2016, Mr. Clasper traveled through the United States seeking the sites of lynchings. He wanted to show how places that call no attention to themselves were the sites of hangings, slashings or execution by gunfire. In the course of covering 24 sites, they span 150 years, right up to the present century, and range from the American south to New York City.\n\n\u201cFrom my perspective, I take it back to 1903, when the American scholar and activist W.E.B. Du Bois said the problem of the 20th century is the problem of the color line,\u201d Mr. Clasper said. \u201cIt seems to me not a lot has changed despite significant advances. There has been barely a year or generation that has passed where racism and violence have not been at the forefront of the American experience.\u201d\n\nAs the London-born son of a British mother and American father, Mr. Clasper said he had \u201ca deep spiritual connection to the American landscape.\u201d In this series \u2014 titled \u201cThe Spaces We Inherit\u201d \u2014 he hopes to gently confront viewers in a way that eschews graphic images of violence.\n\n\u201cI took a different approach and focused on the spaces to encourage people to look at this history from an altered perspective,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve become desensitized to images of violence. But everything that happen s has to happen somewhere.\u201d\n\nGiven the persisting tensions over racial and religious prejudice, Mr. Clasper wants to gently provoke a necessary conversation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to investigate these deep-seated issues in America,\u201d he said. \u201cI think many agree that the nation has not dealt with its bloody past of lynchings and segregation. It seemed to me there has been no collective acceptance, let alone recognition of the mistakes made and the sins committed.\u201d\n\nInterviews were conducted by Oliver Clasper and have been edited for brevity.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Jesse Lee Bond, Arlington, Tenn., 1939\n\nOn April 28, 1939, a local sharecropper named Jesse Lee Bond was shot to death in broad daylight by employees of SY Wilson, a local hardware store. Jesse Lee Bond had asked for an invoice the day before after purchasing goods on credit, something that was no\u0095t done by African-Americans at that time as keeping sharecroppers in the dark about how much they had spent was one way for white owners to keep their workers in constant debt. The day of Jesse Lee Bond\u2019s murder he was ordered back to the store. His aunt accompanied him and witnessed the whole thing. \u201cThey shot at him and shot him. He ran out to the outhouse. They riddled the outhouse. And when he staggered out of the outhouse, they threw him down, castrated him, and dragged him to the river,\u0095\u201d she said. The family was told he had drowned accidentally.\n\nImage\n\nSylvester Lewis, Memphis\n\n\u201cI remember my cousin Jesse well. I was 9 when he was killed and he was 20. What I heard was that there had been a dispute at the SY Wilson general store over in Arlington. Jesse insisted on a receipt, but this is something they didn\u2019\u0095t do. I think whoever he was negotiating with relented, but I think the people over him, the father of the individual in question, didn\u2019\u0095t like it. They went to his home and said they wanted to talk to him and ordered him back to the store. When he returned they attacked him. He tried to run for his life but they caught up with him and shot him. I also heard that they dragged his body behind a vehicle and then dumped him in the river. The descendants are running the store now, and I\u2019\u0095m not sure they know what happened. The ones who were allegedly involved in the lynching passed a long time ago, but their relations are still in Arlington. I don\u2019t think there\u2019\u0095s any resentment now. Anyone who hears about it can\u2019\u0095t understand how that could happen. They simply can\u2019t relate to that kind of criminal activity.\u201d\n\nInterviewed November 2016.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Emmett Till, Drew, Miss., 1955.\n\nIn what is one of the most significant race-related events in the history of the United States, Emmett Till, a 14-year-old Chicago native, was brutally lynched in rural Mississippi on Aug. 28, 1955. Till, who had been visiting family members in the area, entered a local white-owned grocery store in the town of Money for less than one minute. Whatever was said between him and the proprietor, Carolyn Bryant, was used as the pretext for his murder. Four days later Till was abducted from his uncle\u2019\u0095s house by Roy Bryant, Carolyn\u2019\u0095s husband, and J.W. Milam and driven to a nearby barn where he was severely beaten and tortured (the original wall of the barn can be seen on the left of the photograph). He was then taken to the Tallahatchie River, shot in the head, and drowned with a cotton gin fan tied around his neck. In an infamous court case both defendants were found \u0094not guilty\u0095 by an all-white jury. Months later they sold their story and admitted their guilt, with Bryant claiming that the Supreme Court decision Brown v. Board of Education that desegregated schools was a mistake. Emmett Till\u2019s mother, Mamie Till Bradley, allowed photos to be taken of her son\u2019s broken and swollen body because she \u201cwanted the world to see what they did to my baby.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nDr. Jeffrey Andrews, Drew, Miss.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know the history of the property when I purchased it in 2003 and it was only two years later that a few local people told me of the Emmett Till murder. I\u2019ve lived in Drew since I was 12 and I had never heard of it. I\u2019ve since modified the barn to make it more functional and useful, and someone once asked me why I would change a historical site, but history is in the past and people should move on. Things have changed drastically here in the Mississippi Delta region and race relations are at all-time high. History is an important learning tool and it should be used to help people move forward, but one thing you have to remember is that people here don\u2019t want to be constantly reminded of how things were 60 years ago. We\u2019ve all moved forward, and sometimes people aren\u2019t given enough credit for the changes we\u2019ve made. I respect everyone\u2019s feelings towards Emmett Till, and I\u2019ve met some of his family members. They\u2019re great people. This has been a learning experience for my family and we appreciate the fact that we\u2019re part of a historical site.\u201d\n\nInterviewed March 2017.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Joe Coe, Omaha, 1891\n\nOn Oct. 10, 1891, a 50-year-old African-American named Joe Coe (also known as George Smith) was accused of sexually assaulting a 5-year-old girl and was quickly arrested. Rumors spread that the girl had died and that Coe would get off lightly, neither of which was true. A frenzied mob seized him from the jail at the Douglas County Courthouse, put a rope around his neck, and dragged his body through the streets. Coe was then hanged from a streetcar wire on the corner of 17th and Harney in front of thousands of onlookers. Souvenirs of the rope were later sold. Mayor Richard C. Cushing of Omaha condemned the lynching as \u201c\u0094the most deplorable thing that has ever happened in the history of the country.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Ell Persons, Memphis, 1917\n\nWhen the decapitated body of a 16-year-old local, Antoinette Rappel, was found near the old Wolf River Bridge in May 1917, Ell Persons, a local black woodcutter, was deemed a possible suspect. Despite being arrested and released twice, he was captured a third time and forced to confess. A local mob announced that he was to be lynched the next day. The news spread, and a crowd of 3,000 turned up to witness his lynching (including students of Central High School). Ell Persons was burned on a makeshift pyre in a carnival-like atmosphere. He was then decapitated, and his head was taken to the predominantly African-American Beale Street and thrown at locals. A century later his lynching was commemorated and a historic marker was erected near the site.\n\nImage\n\nAmal Altareb, Memphis\n\n\u201cI came to America in 2012 from Yemen. I\u2019m still learning the language and the history, and it wasn\u2019t until the spring of last year that I learned about lynchings. I knew some of the history of segregation and Jim Crow laws, and I knew how unfair the system was \u2014 that African-Americans weren\u2019t treated as equals \u2014 but I didn\u2019t know that human beings had been burned or hanged from a tree just because of their race. Last year my class at Central High School were discussing it and I asked what lynchings were and they were surprised that I didn\u2019t know. It\u2019s surprising that humans can go so far as to kill someone else in this way and create a festival-like atmosphere. There were even spectators. Uncovering the truth is painful, but it\u2019s important. The African-American students especially don\u2019t talk about it because it\u2019s painful, and it reminds them of the injustices towards their race. White Americans don\u2019t want to remember either because of the guilt they feel. I can understand why people want to avoid the topic, but we need to face history in order to move forward.\u201d\n\nInterviewed October 2016.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Leo Frank, Marietta, Ga., 1915\n\nMary Phagan, 13, was found dead on April 26, 1913, at a National Pencil Company factory where she worked. Amid an atmosphere of anti-Semitism and despite conflicting evidence, a Jewish superintendent named Leo Frank was convicted of the crime. Frank\u2019s sentence was later commuted from the death penalty to life imprisonment, a decision that led a mob on Aug. 17, 1915, to seize him from state prison and lynch him from a tree in Marietta, Mary Phagan\u2019s hometown. Later that year the second chapter of the Ku Klux Klan was founded on Stone Mountain, with a number of Leo Frank\u2019s murderers present. Leo Frank was posthumously pardoned in 1986.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of George W. Murray, Mae Murray Dorsey, Roger Malcom and Dorothy Malcolm, Walton County, Georgia, 1946\n\nAfter Roger Malcom, a World War II veteran and Georgia sharecropper, had been bailed out of jail after allegedly stabbing a white man, members of the local community decided to take revenge. On July 25, 1946, a mob of 15 to 20 stopped the car Malcom was riding in with his wife, Dorothy, and another couple, George W. Murray and Mae Murray Dorsey, who was pregnant. They tied the four of them to a nearby tree and shot them to death. Mae Murray Dorsey then had her unborn baby ripped out of her. Despite an F.B.I. investigation nobody was brought to trial for the crime, and a few months later a grand jury was \u201cunable to establish the identity of any persons guilty of violating the civil rights statute of the United States.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nCeleste Butler, Omaha\n\n\u201cTracing one\u2019s roots and one\u2019s history is hard, especially as an African-American. These are big questions we all want to know: Who are we and where do we come from? I had DNA testing done recently but it didn\u2019t lead anywhere. It just told me that my ancestors came from West Africa, but it couldn\u2019t say where exactly. Missing that part and not being able to hand it down to my children or grandchildren is frustrating. On top of that you hear some people in this country telling black people to \u2018go back home.\u2019 Home to what? Home to whom? It feels like a total assault both mentally and physically to have chapters and generations missing. Not being able to fill that void is difficult. When it comes to racial violence I feel like we\u2019re constantly suffering from PTSD. It\u2019s a stress that never really goes away. A lot of people suffer in pain and in silence, and they suffer for successive generations. Everything was stripped from us, and we\u2019ve been struggling to put the pieces back together ever since.\u201d\n\nInterviewed September 2017.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Michael Donald, Mobile, Ala., 1981\n\nMichael Donald, 19, was abducted on March 21, 1981, by Henry Hays and James Knowles as he was walking home. They beat him, slit his throat, and hanged his body from a tree outside 114 Herndon Avenue. The pretext for Donald\u2019s murder was a \u201cnot guilty\u201d verdict handed down by a partially black jury to an African-American man accused of killing a white police officer. This incensed the Alabama chapter of the Ku Klux Klan, led by Benny Jack Hays, the father of Henry Hays, who suggested killing a random black person in response. Michael Donald\u2019s mother, Beulah Mae Donald, with the help of the Southern Poverty Law Center, brought a case not just against the killers but also the United Klans of America. Beulah Mae Donald won the case and received $7 million in damages, essentially bankrupting the U.K.A. Henry Hays was executed, while Knowles received life imprisonment. Hays is the only known Klan member to have been executed in the 20th century for the murder of an African-American. Herndon Avenue has since been renamed Michael Donald Avenue and a historic marker has been erected.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Mulugeta Seraw, Portland, Ore., 1988\n\nOn the evening of Nov. 13, 1988, an Ethiopian student named Mulugeta Seraw was being dropped off at his apartment when he was attacked by Kenneth Mieske, Kyle Brewster and Steve Strasser, members of a local racist skinhead group called East Side White Pride. Mieske delivered the fatal blows with a baseball bat. He was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. In 1990 Seraw\u2019s family, represented by the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League, brought a civil lawsuit against the killers\u2019 affiliated group, the White Aryan Nation, and its leaders, Tom and John Metzger, for $12.5 million. Tom Metzger later said that the killers had done their \u201ccivic duty\u201d by killing Seraw.\n\nImage\n\nJason Downard, Portland, Ore.\n\n\u201cWhen I was 2 I was put into foster care, and in 2009 I went to prison for a gang-affiliated drive-by shooting. I didn\u2019t grow up racist, but in prison the racist skinheads pulled me into their group and drilled stuff into my head about how the media is run by Jews and that they wanted an all-white nation. I also got a tattoo of a swastika on my leg, which I\u2019ve since had covered up. It\u2019s a painful reminder. The skinheads showed me support and love and compassion, which I hadn\u2019t experienced before in my life; everyone is looking for some kind of acceptance. I was angry and uncomfortable with who I was, and I drove that anger towards people who didn\u2019t look like me. In the last two years of the movement my sister had a son with a black guy and my nephew would give me this look like he knew what I was about. I started to get a guilty conscience and began to think about the things I thought I believed in. My sister said I\u2019d been brainwashed, and I can see why. The movement just taught me to hate and reinforced those views. The problem of racism in this country is much deeper than many people think. When it comes to Trump, he\u2019s tacitly endorsed the alt-right and white supremacists. It\u2019s been a ripple effect and things have gotten worse since he came into power. The right now feel emboldened. I look back now at some of the things I\u2019ve done and I realize that I\u2019ve hurt a lot of people. I decided I wanted to help others who had been in a similar position to me, and that\u2019s been my mission ever since. Now I work for an organization called Life After Hate. I\u2019m a marked man, and maybe I\u2019ll die doing this, but at least I\u2019ll die knowing I did the right thing.\u201d\n\nInterviewed October 2017.\n\nImage\n\nThe Murder Site of Timothy Caughman, New York City, 2017\n\nOn March 17, 2017 James Harris Jackson traveled from his home in Baltimore to New York City with the intention of killing random black men. The reason, he later told police, was his hatred of interracial relationships. Three days later he found Timothy Caughman, 66, collecting cans in a trash bin on the corner of West 36th and 9th Avenue and stabbed him multiple times with an 18-inch sword. Caughman died of his injuries that night, and two days later Jackson turned himself in, telling police that he had planned to kill more black men in Times Square. On March 27, Jackson was charged with one count each of murder in the first and second degrees as an act of terrorism, second-degree murder as a hate crime, and three counts of criminal possession of a weapon.\n\n\u201cThe Spaces We Inherit,\u201d which will be published as a book by Overlapse in October 2018, is available for pre-order.\n\nFollow @nytimesphoto on Twitter.

Though his inquiry is intensely, at times painfully personal, Mr. Wilkerson is above all concerned with unpacking the mechanisms of racial domination. The procedure is akin to performing surgery on a half-conscious subject, or digging up a buried land mine that has lost little of its explosive power.\n\nVideo\n\nThe focus of his excavation is a killing that took place in Dothan, Ala., in 1946, when S.E. Branch, a white shopkeeper, shot Bill Spann, a black man who was in his store. Branch, Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s great-grandfather, was charged with first-degree murder, but no trial was ever held, and the crime faded from memory. Or rather, the memory of it was quietly and systematically suppressed. All that remains are a short newspaper article and a few photographs and home movies of the killer.\n\n\u201cDid You Wonder Who Fired the Gun?\u201d proceeds on several parallel tracks. Mr. Wilkerson returns to Alabama and tries to discover both how Bill Spann died and how he was forgotten. His investigation, accompanied by haunting images of Southern back roads and quiet houses, is punctuated by reminders that Bill Spann\u2019s death is hardly a unique or anomalous event. The names of Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner and other recent victims of racist violence appear onscreen, and two songs of protest loop into the soundtrack: Janelle Mon\u00e1e\u2019s \u201cHell You Talmbout\u201d and Phil Ochs\u2019s \u201cWilliam Moore.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat song, about a white postal worker and civil rights activist murdered on an Alabama highway in 1963, is the source of the film\u2019s title and a part of its wider cultural context. \u201cDid You Wonder Who Fired the Gun?\u201d is a passionately political film, aflame with rage in spite of its director\u2019s measured, ruminative tone of voice. It is also a horror movie, full of specters and silences and a terror that is pervasive, intimate and elusive.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Wilkerson, whose previous films include \u201cAn Injury to One\u201d and \u201cFar From Afghanistan,\u201d dispenses with many of the usual techniques of historical documentary. There are a few on-camera interviews, with neighbors and relatives, but more frequently Mr. Wilkerson narrates encounters that took place off camera. And his sleuthing often leads not to moments of revelation but to dead ends and deeper mysteries. The insertion of clips from \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d provides a chilling and ironic counterpoint to the grim story this movie is telling. S.E. Branch is the opposite of Gregory Peck\u2019s brave and decent Atticus Finch, and the truth about what happened to Bill Spann resists the kind of redemptive, healing conclusion that remains a cornerstone of American racial fantasy.\n\nInstead of consolation, Mr. Wilkerson offers commitment. Instead of idealism, honesty. He doesn\u2019t suppose that his film will solve anything, but there is nonetheless something profoundly useful about the way he confronts past and present manifestations of white supremacy. He links his great-grandfather\u2019s crime to the contemporaneous gang rape of Recy Taylor (the subject of an excellent recent documentary by Nancy Buirski), and uncovers patterns of abuse within his family. He corresponds with a relative who is part of a white nationalist, \u201cSouthern secessionist\u201d group. He notes the way racial injustice dwells in apparently mundane facts. The killer is immortalized in pictures and a well-kept tombstone. His victim has been almost entirely erased from memory, a kind of second death beyond the reach of redress or revenge.", "keywords": ["white", "bill", "mr", "movie", "gun", "supremacy", "fired", "memory", "wonder", "spann", "racial", "wilkerson", "reckons", "review"], "polarity": 0.04540441176470589, "subjectivity": 0.3202205882352941},

People like to have labels for actors, and the truth is, every actor is a character actor. When I say actor, I mean actresses as well. Toni Collette is a good example of someone who can do both leading lady and transformational characters, where you\u2019re barely recognizing them. I think Billy Crudup, Chris Walken, Robert De Niro, they\u2019re all great examples of that.\n\nPeople often use the word \u201cquirky\u201d to describe your characters.

I can relate to self-loathing. The reason a person lashes out the way Dixon does is because he hates himself, so anybody can relate to that. I\u2019m drawn to complex characters; they\u2019re all filled with so many different feelings, and that\u2019s what makes them interesting. The first \u201cIron Man,\u201d Tony Stark, was an interesting character. He drinks too much, he\u2019s a womanizer, and then he has this epiphany. That\u2019s what\u2019s interesting.\n\nWhat do you think it was about this role, and this film, that led to so many awards?\n\nIt\u2019s the transformational aspect of it, the fact that he was really many different roles wrapped up in one role. He\u2019s a doofus, he\u2019s a racist, he\u2019s violent, he\u2019s a mama\u2019s boy. There\u2019s a few heroic things at certain points. But he\u2019s very flawed, and it\u2019s a boy-to-man journey.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThere\u2019s been criticism that your character got away scot-free for his racist behavior and for throwing a guy out the window, and never being brought to justice.\n\nIt\u2019s a small town and, who knows, in real life maybe he would have gotten thrown in prison. It\u2019s a sort of dark fairy tale in certain ways \u2014 it\u2019s not necessarily meant to be completely realistic. And if it is meant to be realistic, in real life, things aren\u2019t tied up in a bow. People who deserve to get punished don\u2019t necessarily get punished.\n\nDid it surprise you that there was criticism of the movie along these lines?\n\nNo, whenever a movie is popular and it is a complex dramatic story, I think it\u2019s going to stir up a lot of feelings. A lot of good stuff come out of it \u2014 the billboards that have been popping up [activists recreated versions of the billboards in Miami and London]. That\u2019s kind of incredible, when a movie can effect social change, that\u2019s kind of astounding. I think Mildred [the film\u2019s mother, played by Frances McDormand, who is seeking justice in the murder of her daughter] is a really beautiful working-class wonder woman in some ways. It\u2019s a kind of antihero slash protagonist thing that I think women really need right now. Mildred and [the directors] Greta Gerwig and Patty Jenkins. It\u2019s been an incredibly vibrant year.\n\nYou\u2019re a really good dancer \u2014 you can really bust a move. You did the splits on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d How did that come about? Is it self-taught?\n\nIt\u2019s a long story, but I hung out with a certain crowd, and it was a way to meet girls.\n\nWhat kind of certain crowd?\n\nSan Francisco is not all cable cars and Rice-A-Roni. There were some tough kids there. When I was in middle school, there was a more white supremacist kind of group I didn\u2019t get along with. I got in a lot of fights with them and didn\u2019t win a lot of those fights. I didn\u2019t get along with the rich kids, people we called WPODs: white punks on dope. My school was interracial, and I met a cool group of friends who introduced me to some other friends. I used to do really bad break dancing, when \u201cThriller\u201d and \u201cPurple Rain\u201d came out. I was into Run-DMC, Grandmaster Flash, Doug E. Fresh, Eric B. & Rakim. Probably my biggest inspiration was James Brown, and watching Tom Cruise in \u201cRisky Business.\u201d I remember practicing that, and watching James Brown do the splits. I [recently] did SoulCycle, I\u2019m not proud to say, and Usher was next to me. I thought I had rhythm until I was on a bicycle next to Usher. This is what happens when you go to spinning class in Hollywood.\n\nWere you intimidated working with Frances McDormand?\n\nI think it\u2019s the biggest compliment to Frances that people are asking, \u201cWere you intimidated by her?\u201d Not really, but I was nervous to get in the ring with a great actor. I\u2019ve worked with a lot of great actors. She\u2019s really a force. I think what\u2019s great about her is her integrity. Her sense of truth is like an iron bar. All these people \u2014 Woody [Harrelson, a co-star], Martin [McDonagh, the film\u2019s writer-director], Frances \u2014 are true anarchists, they really are. I think it comes through in their work. I\u2019m not exactly conventional either.\n\nSo your dad posted a comment on that New York Times essay criticizing the film \u2014 he defended you.

While it may not be a common vantage point, the narrative is a natural one for Marilyn Stern, a photographer and graphic artist who is a member of the Metropolitan Postcard Club of New York City.\n\nNot surprisingly, the vast majority of postcards that feature black people in the United States from the 19th and 20th centuries were very racist, she said.\n\n\u201cI was so sick of seeing these horrible racist stereotypes,\u201d said Ms. Stern, a collector since the mid-1970s. \u201cWhenever I came across something that was not racist or not stereotypical, or even went so far as showing romance between the races, I wanted to save it and collect it.\u201d\n\nHer collection, which numbers about 3,000, has about 300 postcards that depict African-American life in all lights.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard for us to fathom how isolated people were, especially in rural areas and isolated small towns before there were telephones and radios,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were postal deliveries three times a day, so it was the internet of the early 1900s.\u201d\n\nPostcards had better printing technology than magazines and newspapers did at the time, as the burst of color in the selection below shows. They could show racism with clarity. \u201cThe idea that you could see images so realistic blew people away,\u201d she said.\n\nMany of the racist postcards were a form of propaganda, she said.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important to see how racism was manifested in the past,\u201d she said, \u201cperhaps to better fight it in the present. You can recognize something if you\u2019ve seen it before.\u201d\n\nBelow is a selection from Ms. Stern\u2019s collection with descriptions based on her research.\n\nTrade Cards\n\nImage\n\nAfrican-Americans were often subjects \u2014 and targets \u2014 of advertising cards that were issued before 1900. These cards were frequently given away in products, or with the purchase of a product.\n\nAbove, an advertisement for J & P Coats thread. Below, a country doctor dispensing Ayer\u2019s Cathartic Pills.\n\nImage\n\nThe Cakewalk\n\nImage\n\nThe Cakewalk, a dance created by plantation slaves as a satire of Southern white society, was the focus of these cards, which featured two black children and an African-American troupe that toured Europe in the late 1800s and early 1900s.\n\nRacist Cards\n\nImage\n\nThe card on the left was shot in a professional studio, but it was labeled \u201cHer Country Cousins.\u201d The implication was that no matter how refined, educated or successful black Americans became, they were still basically savages, Ms. Stern said.\n\nThe two cards on the right were produced in 1905 in New York on the common theme of the delivery stork. The first one, with the caption \u201cComparing Notes,\u201d shows both a black baby and a white baby, with no apparent bias. The second one shows two black babies with the slogan \u201cNo Race Suicide,\u201d implying that a high black birthrate threatened white supremacy, she said.\n\n\u201cLovers of All Nations\u201d\n\nImage\n\nThis postcard was from a series mailed in 1908 that was called \u201cLovers of All Nations.\u201d The banjo was a racial stereotype, but the card is in the non-discriminating \u201cFamily of Man\u201d tradition.\n\nMemories of Slavery\n\nImage\n\nPostcards once served as documentary photography. Some cards honored older African-Americans of the South, who were living memories of slavery. This was part of a series, and it was mailed in 1906.\n\nLife in the Jim Crow South\n\nImage\n\nA fortuneteller with white clients, mailed in 1908.\n\nHoliday Greetings\n\nImage\n\nIdealized country life, in a card mailed in 1907, as Americans flocked to cities.\n\nReligion\n\nImage\n\nA card, likely from the early 1950s, urging parishioners to come to church.\n\nReal Photos\n\nImage\n\nAn unidentified young woman in her graduation cap and gown, in a studio portrait taken between the 1920s and \u201940s.

I am 74 years old and I have seen a lot of racism in my life but \u201cGone With the Wind\u201d was the worst. It depicted a black women as a slave, who at the same time had power. At the time of the film I didn\u2019t really understand a lot about racism and the fact that I was a second-class person.

I grew up watching movies and I love the old Hollywood movies especially, but it makes me sad to realize that Hollywood\u2019s portrayal of Asians has been mocking or missing for most of its history.

I saw myself reflected in \u201cFunny Girl.\u201d With a New York City backdrop, song lyrics and Barbra Streisand\u2019s delivery, I felt for the first time, in the eyes of the larger world, at age 12, accepted.\n\n\u2014 Jill Sager\n\nImage Diahann Carroll and Sidney Poitier in \"Paris Blues.\" Credit Kino Lorber\n\nI am 70 years old and watched classic Hollywood movies on television during the 1950s and \u201960s.

He argued that biological differences and not a lack of opportunity explained the shortage of women in leadership and technical positions.\n\nGoogle fired Mr. Damore. He filed a lawsuit in January with another former employee, claiming that the company discriminates against white men with conservative views. In a separate lawsuit, a former recruiter for YouTube sued Google because, he said, he was fired for resisting a mandate to hire only diverse \u2014 female or black and Latino \u2014 candidates.\n\nGoogle\u2019s handling of the issue was also upsetting to Mr. Damore\u2019s critics. In another lawsuit filed last month, a former Google employee said he was fired because he was too outspoken in advocating diversity and for spending too much time on \u201csocial activism.\u201d\n\nInside Google, vocal diversity proponents say they are the targets of a small group of employees who are sympathetic to Mr. Damore. In some cases, screenshots of comments made on an internal social network were leaked to online forums frequented by right-wing groups, which searched for and published personal information like home addresses and phone numbers of the Google employees, they said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn 2015, Google started an internal program called Respect@, which includes a way for employees to anonymously report complaints of inappropriate behavior by co-workers. Some diversity supporters say other employees are taking advantage of this program to accuse them of harassment for out-of-context statements.\n\n\u201cSome people feel threatened by movements that promote diversity and inclusion. They think it means people are going to come for their jobs,\u201d said Liz Fong-Jones, a Google engineer who is a vocal supporter of diversity.\n\nMany big tech companies are struggling with the challenge of creating a more diverse work force. In 2015, Facebook adopted the so-called Rooney Rule. Originally used by the National Football League to prod teams to consider coaching prospects who are black, the rule requires managers to interview candidates from underrepresented backgrounds for open positions. But last year, Facebook\u2019s female engineers said that gender bias was still a problem and that their work received more scrutiny than men\u2019s work.\n\nEven executives tasked with promoting diversity have had difficulties. In October, Denise Young Smith, who was Apple\u2019s vice president of inclusion and diversity, came under fire when she said that there was diversity even among 12 white, blue-eyed, blond men because they had different backgrounds and experiences. She later apologized, saying she did not intend to play down the importance of a non-homogenous work force. She left Apple in December.\n\nThe tension is elevated at Google, at least in part, by its workplace culture. Google has encouraged employees to express themselves and challenge one another. It provides many communication systems for people to discuss work and nonwork related issues. Even topics considered out of bounds at other workplaces \u2014 like sharp criticism of its own products \u2014 are discussed openly and celebrated.\n\nIn January, on one of Google\u2019s 90,000 \u201cgroups\u201d \u2014 internal email lists around a discussion topic \u2014 an employee urged colleagues to donate money to help pay Mr. Damore\u2019s legal fees from his lawsuit against Google to promote \u201cviewpoint diversity,\u201d according to a person who saw the posting but is not permitted to share the information publicly.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nSome Google employees who are diversity advocates said management had not taken action against people who tried to bait them into making angry statements.\n\nLast month, Tim Chevalier, who had worked at Google as an engineer until November, sued for wrongful termination, claiming that he was fired \u201cbecause of his political statements in opposition to the discrimination, harassment and white supremacy he saw being expressed on Google\u2019s internal messaging systems.\u201d He said one employee had suggested that there was a shortage of black and Latino employees at Google because they were \u201cnot as good.\u201d\n\nMr. Chevalier said he had been fired shortly after saying that Republicans were \u201cwelcome to leave\u201d if they did not feel comfortable with Google\u2019s policies. He said he had meant that being a Republican did not exempt Google employees from following the company\u2019s code of conduct.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA Google spokeswoman said in a statement that the company encouraged lively debate. But there are limits.\n\n\u201cCreating a more diverse workplace is a big challenge and a priority we\u2019ve been working to address. Some people won\u2019t agree with our approach, and they\u2019re free to express their disagreement,\u201d said the spokeswoman, Gina Scigliano. \u201cBut some conduct and discussion in the workplace crosses a line, and we don\u2019t tolerate it. We enforce strong policies, and work with affected employees, to ensure everyone can do their work free of harassment, discrimination and bullying.\u201d\n\nIn the past, discussions about diversity in Google\u2019s online chat groups would encounter skeptical but subtle comments or questions. The debate turned openly antagonistic after Mr. Damore\u2019s memo, which was titled \u201cGoogle\u2019s Ideological Echo Chamber.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe James Damore thing brought everything to a head,\u201d said Vicki Holland, a linguist who has worked at Google for seven years. \u201cIt brought everything to the surface where everyone could see it.\u201d\n\nMr. Damore said he began to question Google\u2019s diversity policies at a weekly company meeting last March. At the meeting, Ruth Porat, the chief financial officer of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, and Eileen Naughton, Google\u2019s vice president of people operations, \u201cpointed out and shamed\u201d departments in which women accounted for less than half the staff, according to Mr. Damore\u2019s lawsuit.\n\nThe two female executives \u2014 who are among the company\u2019s highest-ranking women \u2014 said Google\u2019s \u201cracial and gender preferences were not up for debate,\u201d according to the lawsuit. Mr. Damore subsequently attended a \u201cDiversity and Inclusion Summit,\u201d where it reinforced his view that Google was \u201celevating political correctness over merit\u201d with its diversity measures.\n\nMr. Damore said he had written his memo afterward in response.\n\nMs. Scigliano, the Google spokeswoman, said the company looked forward to fighting Mr. Damore\u2019s lawsuit in court. Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, said in an August blog post that he had fired Mr. Damore because his memo advanced \u201charmful gender stereotypes\u201d but that \u201cmuch of the memo is fair to debate.\u201d\n\nSome employees said they were abstaining from internal debate on sensitive issues because they worried that their comments might be misconstrued or used against them. Like the broader internet, the conversations tend to be dominated by the loudest voices, they said.\n\nGoogle\u2019s diversity advocates said they would like to see more moderation on internal forums with officials stepping in to defuse tensions before conversations get out of hand. Ms. Miller, the Coworker.org co-director, said Google employees had expressed concern about how this would affect an internal culture rooted in transparency and free expression.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s on everyone\u2019s mind is: Has the culture been inextricably damaged by this environment?\u201d she said.", "keywords": ["mr", "googles", "diversify", "work", "hard", "fired", "internal", "diversity", "lawsuit", "google", "trying", "damore", "employees"], "polarity": 0.08552789802789805, "subjectivity": 0.3460065686628187},

Asked if her resignation had to do with the direction Ms. Freiman was taking the institute, or rather her management style, William A. Royall Jr., co-chairman of the I.C.A. board, said: \u201cThere were no reservations about the curatorial direction she was taking whatsoever,\u201d without addressing the rest.\n\nThe show will go on as planned, led by the I.C.A.\u2019s chief curator, Stephanie Smith. \u201cThe exhibition is functioning as a declaration of intent for the I.C.A. being an institution that\u2019s going to grapple directly with issues that matter in our world through supporting artists\u2019 diverse voices,\u201d Ms. Smith said.\n\nAlmost half the artists have been commissioned to make new work for the show.

The Baptist part is inherited, like baldness or dimples: Both of my grandfathers and three of my uncles were Baptist preachers, and my parents met as graduate students at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. Genes aside, the church \u2014 plastic chairs, pilling carpet and grape juice for communion \u2014 was the organizing institution of my childhood, where I met my closest friends and most of the significant adults in my life.\n\nChurch attendance has been in generational decline. I began calling around, exploring whether people in small towns were looking for community elsewhere and, with the white nationalist rallies so often in the news, whether young white people were looking for meaning in the grim sanctuaries of the alt-right.\n\nBut I kept hearing about something different. Pastors, theologians and sociologists were talking of how black worshipers were leaving white-majority churches. They were leaving quietly and not en masse, a family here, a single person there. But it was happening everywhere, a movement large enough for some to see the unraveling of decades of efforts at racial reconciliation.\n\nI would find someone on Facebook, a black worshiper who had posted about leaving her mostly white church, and then I would find someone in the same situation halfway across the country. They would both think they were going through this alone, yet the accounts would be remarkably similar, the timelines nearly identical, even some of the words and phrases the same. There had been, I discovered, some sharp reporting about this, particularly from the writer Deborah Jian Lee, but not as much as you would expect for an experience that seemed to be this broadly shared.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPeople spoke to me of being tired, let down, heartbroken. Political and cultural partitions that they had long overlooked at worship time now overshadowed every service. The realizations almost always began with the death of Trayvon Martin in 2012, and a sense that white church leaders or fellow worshipers did not want to talk about how a black teenager walking home from a 7-Eleven could end up dead. Sometimes the preacher would privately express sympathy, but also concern about how his white congregation would take it. Maybe there would be a meeting.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

But no more.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nShe was elected to Parliament from a safe district last year, after winning only a third of the vote in the presidential election, far worse than her supporters had hoped.\n\nAnd she has been nearly silent ever since. Far from constituting the principal opposition to President Emmanuel Macron, a promise she made last year, her voice in the National Assembly is inaudible. The influence of the Front\u2019s few parliamentary deputies is negligible. The party has virtually disappeared as a national force.\n\nThe party congress this weekend in Lille was intended, in part, to reverse this. Ms. Le Pen has received authorization to change the National Front\u2019s name, still associated with the party\u2019s founder, her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, and his years of Holocaust denial and association with Nazi collaborators.\n\nKicked out of the party by his daughter in 2015, Mr. Le Pen called a name change \u201csuicidal\u201d in a recent interview. For the first time since the Front was founded in 1972, he is not attending the party congress.\n\nMs. Le Pen has herself expressed ambivalence about continuing in the role of party president, and some party activists interviewed here also suggested the Front\u2019s future is not inevitably tied to the woman who inherited the leadership from her father.\n\n\u201cFor now we\u2019re with Marine Le Pen.

As Nils Gilman argues in The American Interest, that ideal reached its apogee with the election of Barack Obama.\n\nBut Obama\u2019s election also revealed the limits of that ideal.

Progress is less about understanding and liking each other and more about smashing structures that others defend.\n\nThe second thing that happened was that reason, apparently, ceased to matter. Today\u2019s young people were raised within an educational ideology that taught them that individual reason and emotion were less important than perspectivism \u2014 what perspective you bring as a white man, a black woman, a transgender Mexican, or whatever.\n\nThese students were raised with the idea that individual reason is downstream from group identity. Then along came the 2016 election to validate that point of view! If reason and deliberation are central to democracy, how on earth did Donald Trump get elected?\n\nIf you were born after 1990, it\u2019s not totally shocking that you would see public life as an inevitable war of tribe versus tribe.

The powerful few keep everyone else down. The solutions to injustice and suffering are simple and obvious: Defeat the powerful. Passion is more important than reason because the oppressed masses have to mobilize to storm the barricades. Debate is counterproductive because it dilutes passion and sows confusion. Discordant ideas are not there to inform; they are there to provide cover for oppression.\n\nSome people I admire see today\u2019s student mobbism as an outbreak of an ersatz religion, but I\u2019d say their theory of social change is at least comprehensible given the era they inhabit.\n\nIf I could talk to the students I\u2019d try to persuade them that mistake theory is a more accurate and effective way to change the world than conflict theory, but I probably wouldn\u2019t persuade them.\n\nSo I\u2019d just ask them to take two courses. The first would be in revolutions \u2014 the French, Russian, Chinese and all the other ones that unleashed the passion of the mob in an effort to overthrow oppression \u2014 and the way they ALL wound up waist deep in blood.\n\nThe second would be in constitutionalism.

The show gave me the \u201cendorsement\u201d I had been craving all my (short) life.\n\n\u2014 Alex Gonzalez\n\nThe first time I saw myself on the big screen was when \u201cGone With the Wind\u201d came out and had Hattie McDaniel as the maid. I am 74 years old and I have seen a lot of racism in my life but \u201cGone With the Wind\u201d was the worst. It depicted a black women as a slave, who at the same time had power. At the time of the film I didn\u2019t really understand a lot about racism and the fact that I was a second-class person. A lot has changed, but a lot has not.\n\n\u2014 Gwendolyn Morgan\n\nI always liked \u201cIn the Heat of the Night\u201d because as a well-spoken, professional black man, I have found myself in Sidney Poitier\u2019s character\u2019s position: People can\u2019t figure me out.

They looked like people in my St. Albans and Jamaica, Queens, neighborhood.\n\n\u2014 DeBorah Palmer\n\nI remember watching \u201cMulan,\u201d which came out when I was in middle school, and absolutely freaking out. I\u2019m not Chinese; I\u2019m Korean and was adopted by a white family as a baby, but in a media landscape that still largely excludes people of East Asian descent, I\u2019ll celebrate what I can get.\n\n\u2014 Amanda McClendon\n\nI\u2019m a white woman. Moira Shearer in \u201cRed Shoes.\u201d I was perhaps 8 years old. I grew up in a small town in North Texas. As a child I loved \u201cSong of the South\u201d and had read \u201cUncle Remus\u201d before I saw it. I know it\u2019s not politically correct now, but this film mirrored the kindness, warmth and wisdom I received as a child from African-Americans who worked in our house.\n\n\u2014 Mavis Bryant\n\nAs a black South African, and an African in particular, I felt a deep sense of joy at how \u201cBlack Panther\u201d tried to portray African culture. For once, Africans were good people in a movie, although it was fictional.\n\n\u2014 Khalifah Makgotlho\n\nThe 1972 film \u201cBlack Girl,\u201d starring Peggy Pettit as an aspiring modern dancer.

As someone adopted from China and raised in a predominantly white town, \u201cMulan\u201d was my premier exposure to Asian beauty and culture. Her story\u2019s message about turning adversity into strength sticks with me always.\n\n\u2014 MaiLei Meyers\n\nThe first time I saw gay men represented in film, who felt real and relatable, was in \u201cMy Beautiful Laundrette.\u201d Being gay isn\u2019t what the movie was about, these two characters just were, and that one was brown and the other white and working class made it even better.\n\n\u2014 Michael Ginther\n\n\u201cDrumline,\u201d featuring Nick Cannon, in 2002 and \u201cYou Got Served\u201d in 2004.

I believe that this constant social navigation is ripe for exploration.\n\n\u2014 India Lovato\n\nIn 1988, I saw \u201cThe Milagro Beanfield War.\u201d Most of the characters were Mexican and they were just portrayed as people, not some \u201cFrito Bandito\u201d joke. It made me want to cry with relief.\n\n\u2014 Dawn Reed\n\nGrowing up Italian and plus-size, I never saw women like me in the movies. The closest thing to representation I saw was \u201cThe Godfather,\u201d but my family wasn\u2019t violent or in organized crime so I couldn\u2019t relate. I\u2019m still waiting to see characters like me.\n\n\u2014 Tiffany Magazzeni\n\nI\u2019m still waiting to see myself. I mean there is Michelle Yeoh, an Asian actress in the 1997 movie \u201cTomorrow Never Dies.\u201d She\u2019s not me, but I loved that her character defies the usual Hollywood stereotypes for Asians. But she is not American and I\u2019m not at all a Bond woman. I grew up watching movies and I love the old Hollywood movies especially, but it makes me sad to realize that Hollywood\u2019s portrayal of Asians has been mocking or missing for most of its history. Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan are also imports. There just aren\u2019t any homegrown Asian-American filmmakers yet.\n\n\u2014 Lillian Hsu\n\nI am an African-American man born in 1960, raised in Southern California. The first time I remember seeing someone who looked like me represented on screen in the way I saw myself was in 1967.

Through some common coming-of-age feelings of loneliness and confusion, but also in better understanding the differences, I learned more about myself.\n\n\u2014 Sally Otis\n\nAlthough I am white, I am Jewish with \u201cbig\u201d hair, raised in the Bronx. I saw myself reflected in \u201cFunny Girl.\u201d With a New York City backdrop, song lyrics and Barbra Streisand\u2019s delivery, I felt for the first time, in the eyes of the larger world, at age 12, accepted.\n\n\u2014 Jill Sager\n\nImage Diahann Carroll and Sidney Poitier in \"Paris Blues.\" Credit Kino Lorber\n\nI am 70 years old and watched classic Hollywood movies on television during the 1950s and \u201960s.

Their hope was that by sharing their stories they could start dialogues and inspire change.\n\nI could identify; I knew what it was like to sometimes feel like an outsider. And as an editor at The Times, I wondered what I could do to advance the conversation.\n\nAn answer came as I was researching an obit for a woman in the tennis world. I discovered the story of Mary Ewing Outerbridge when I stumbled upon a website crediting her with introducing tennis to America. I wondered if she had received a Times obituary when she died in 1886. I checked our digital newspaper archives. She had not.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter that, anytime I came across an interesting person who died years ago, I searched our archives for an obit. Those who didn\u2019t get one were, not surprisingly, largely women and people of color. I started talking about my research with colleagues, friends and relatives, all of whom began sending me more names.\n\nI soon had a list of dozens of fascinating people, such as Ms. Larsen; Madhubala, a Bollywood actress whose poetically tragic life was cut short; and Margaret Abbott, a golfer who died without ever knowing that she was the first American woman to win an Olympic championship.\n\nEven more surprising were some blatant omissions of those who had achieved a measure of fame in their lifetime, like the poet Sylvia Plath, the writer Charlotte Bront\u00eb and the photographer Diane Arbus.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t they get obits? I can only speculate. Perhaps the mark they made on the world wasn\u2019t recognized until decades after their deaths. Or maybe some of them faded into obscurity, their achievements forgotten. It could be that The Times didn\u2019t learn about their deaths until it was too late. Or that the omission was more purposeful, a judgment call of an editor who didn\u2019t deem the death newsworthy.\n\nRegardless, I now had an opportunity to give these women their due.\n\nIn November 2017, I met Jessica Bennett, The Times\u2019s first gender editor. She agreed that Overlooked was a compelling way to add to the record, and we decided to partner up.\n\nWhat followed was a whirlwind of excitement in the newsroom, with writers, editors, international correspondents, page designers, photo editors \u2014 whether they were women, men, people of color or not \u2014 asking us how they could contribute. Dozens of people have played a meaningful role in making it come together.\n\nBecause many of the subjects we wrote about died long ago, we decided to diverge from the traditional obituary style of announcing a person\u2019s death at the start of the article. Instead, we encouraged writers to be creative with their storytelling.\n\nThis series is just the beginning.

The best schools, a successful corporate climb, charitable good works and distinguished service awards are impressive and laudable, but not necessarily newsworthy to a global audience.\n\nOne thing to remember is that it is not our intent to honor the dead; we leave the tributes to the eulogists. We seek only to report deaths and to sum up lives, illuminating why, in our judgment, those lives were significant. The justification for the obituary is in the story it tells.\n\nMany readers legitimately ask: Why are the vast majority of our obituary subjects white men? The answer lies in our not-so-distant history.\n\nUnlike the rest of the newsroom, the obituaries desk covers the past, not the present. Our pages mirror the world of 1975 or 1965 or 1955, or even earlier: They\u2019re a rearview mirror, reflecting the world as it was, not as it is, and not as we might wish it to have been.\n\nAnd so we are, inevitably, a generation or three behind in tracking the evolution of gender and racial dynamics, among other things. The prominent shapers of society back then, those who held (and didn\u2019t easily give up) the levers of power, were disproportionately white and male, be they former United States senators or business titans or Hollywood directors.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWith Overlooked, our new collection of obituaries for women and others who never got them, The Times is acknowledging that many worthy subjects were skipped for generations, for whatever reasons.\n\nConscious or unconscious bias? Could be. Perhaps my predecessors and I were never informed of the deaths. Maybe those who knew the deceased did not think we\u2019d be interested. Maybe an editor passed for lack of interest, or maybe considered an obit but did not have a reporter available to write it. (A practical reality that bedevils us today.)\n\nPerhaps the significance of an individual portrayed in Overlooked was not fully recognized until decades after her death. Or perhaps the paper\u2019s selection standards in eras past unfairly valued the achievements of the white, male mainstream over those of minorities and women who may have been more on the margins.\n\nI\u2019d like to think that those portrayed in Overlooked would be prime candidates for an obit in The Times today \u2014 precisely because they fit a broader standard of significance and impact and, by the way, offer compelling stories.\n\nSo why not more women and people of color on the obituary pages? (Why, for that matter, not more openly gay people, or transgender people?)\n\nThe larger answer: Because relatively few of them were allowed to make such a mark on society in their own time. Universities may have barred them. Businesses and political parties may have shut them out. The tables of power were crowded with white men; there were few seats for anyone else.\n\nThere were, of course, women who crashed glass ceilings, blacks and Native Americans and people of Asian heritage who pushed through \u201cwhites only\u201d barriers. And their stories have been told in the obituary pages over many decades.\n\nNo doubt, we\u2019ll see more of them in the years to come. As time goes on, I imagine that their stories will be increasingly framed not by broken barriers but simply by what they built, unencumbered by the dead weights of discrimination.", "keywords": ["white", "desk", "maybe", "pages", "death", "times", "past", "overlooked", "obituary", "obituaries", "world", "men", "women", "think"], "polarity": 0.10482996385058244, "subjectivity": 0.431367429821038},

We both knew it was just a courtesy, but I thought her old-world charm was very classy. We\u2019re now one of their preferred mortgage lenders.\n\nAn open-door policy\n\nMy office is just past the reception area as you exit the elevator. I chose that location by design, to be accessible. I also leave my door open since I believe closed doors can appear ominous and threatening.\n\nTwo of our female executives and I designed our entire space with an architect and a designer. We have both Asian and American customers, and I wanted the area to reflect the two cultures. Having lived on three continents, I had a feeling about what that might look like: bright colors to jolt people into happiness about when they arrive, and free-flowing space.\n\nImage The office contains elements of both Asian and American cultures.

I use the cricket bats on the weekends with my sons, like an American family goes outside and throws the football around.\n\nMy father\u2019s walking stick is in the corner. I was schooled in the British system of education, which has a formality that never leaves you. It means that sometimes you feel you\u2019re a stranger in a strange land.\n\nSting moved to the U.S. like I did, and when he came out with \u201cEnglishman in New York,\u201d it resonated with me, especially the lines \u201cSee me walking down Fifth Avenue, A walking cane here at my side.\u201d\n\nYou occasionally see walking sticks in English movies, and my father and other Pakistani men used them to shoo away stray dogs on the road.\n\nCloseness and discipline\n\nI hold meetings with my staff at the oval glass-topped table so that the distance between us is never more than a few feet.\n\nI also use the table as a desk, but I spend much of my time at my standing desk. I switched to it about 10 years ago after a former Royal Navy officer impressed upon me that part of his training was learning to stand watch for 10 hours at a time. I was fascinated by the idea that building discipline into humdrum activities like responding to emails is a persistent way of remaining alert all day.\n\nKeeping time\n\nEarlier in my career I worked at Citibank. The blue clock, a memento, marks the tremendous success of its revolutionary digital services platform, myCiti, which launched in 2001.

My most prized literary possession is a 300-year-old compilation of \u201cThe Spectator,\u201d a periodical that described basic social obligations during that time.\n\nFamily heirlooms\n\nWhen I was 18, I brought a mug from my college, Coe College in Iowa, to the woman in Pakistan who would become my wife. I keep it here now, along with my grandfather\u2019s fountain pens. I also have the note my then 8-year-old son Nabi wrote with one when I showed him how to fill the bladder with ink. It was humorous and I was glad to see he could write well.\n\nPieces of history\n\nWhen I was overseeing Citibank marketing for Asia, a colleague gave me a framed replica of shoes worn by Chinese women who underwent foot-binding in the 10th century to keep their feet small as a symbol of social status. The shoes remind me of how certain ersatz practices can seem perfectly normal until the march of history exposes them as absurd.\n\nIt is our job to think critically and question whether certain current practices are the foot-binding of our age.\n\nOrder Reprints | Today\u2019s Paper | Subscribe A version of this article appears in print on , on Page BU 2 of the New York edition with the headline: Bridging Cultures in Downtown Los Angeles\n\n\n\n\n\n", "keywords": ["bridges", "angeles", "lyttle", "melissa", "credit", "president", "usa", "walking", "downtown", "cultures", "bank", "york", "los"], "polarity": 0.1271839623600187, "subjectivity": 0.4025149889234396},

Sarah Laskow of The Atlantic explained in 2014 that philosophers at this time were, in the words of the sociologist Karl Mannheim, \u201canxious to find a general law to express the rhythm of historical development, based on the biological law of the limited lifetimes of man.\u201d /But understanding societal phenomena through the lens of groups of people born around the same time has always had its limits.\n\nFor example, it\u2019s true that for young men coming-of-age during the Vietnam War, being born in a particular year (and, thanks to the draft lottery, on a particular day) could be life-shaping. But even here, an individual\u2019s class was a factor in whether he actually went to war \u2014 men from privileged backgrounds had many options to avoid the draft, the burden of which fell mainly on the working class.\n\nLike war service, entering the labor market at a time of recession, as most millennials did, can be difficult. But race and class are more important in affecting how this experience plays out for individuals.\n\nTake white millennial college graduates: Yes, they\u2019re part of an age cohort that has experienced worse economic conditions than graduates of the preceding generation \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t give us a particularly meaningful understanding of their plight, given that they are still better off when it comes to income than the average non-college-educated worker of any age.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSome may argue that the generation game, if intellectually vacuous, is basically harmless. But dividing society by generation obscures the real and enduring lines of race, class and gender. When, for example, baby boomers are blamed for \u201cruining America,\u201d the argument lumps together Donald Trump and a 60-year-old black woman who works for minimum wage cleaning one of his hotels.\n\nThe pattern of inherited privilege points to yet another reality that the generation game ignores: the decline of social mobility between generations and the rise of what the French economist Thomas Piketty has called a \u201cpatrimonial society.\u201d When it comes to wealth and its accompanying privileges, the wealth of the previous generation of one\u2019s own family matter more than whether your birth year falls on one or other side of some arbitrary boundary.\n\nToday\u2019s young people may choose political action aimed at reversing these trends or to let them continue and accelerate.

Credit Whitney Curtis for The New York Times\n\nOn its website, the comic book publisher Lion Forge states that it is \u201ccommitted to \u2018Comics for Everyone.\u2019\u201d It reflects a particular passion of David Steward II, the chief executive officer of Lion Forge, which is based in St. Louis. \u201cNot only is it the right thing to do, we thought the market was craving authentic characters who had appropriate representation,\u201d Mr. Steward said in a recent phone interview. The approach seems to be working. In February, the Young Adult Library Services Association named \u201cLighter Than My Shadow,\u201d a graphic novel by Katie Green about a young woman\u2019s battle with eating disorders, one of the top 10 \u201cgreat graphic novels for teens\u201d published in 2017. During our interview, Mr. Steward, 40, talked about his career path, diversity in comics, the challenges of the industry and more. These are edited excerpts from that conversation.\n\nHow did you get your start?\n\n\n\nI went to college at American University and graduated with a degree in international business marketing. Then I worked for my dad\u2019s company, World Wide Technology, and realized very quickly it was not for me. Over a dinner, my dad said, \u201cIf you\u2019re doing something you\u2019re passionate about, you\u2019ll never work a day in your life.\u201d That stuck with me and got my wheels turning about what I was really passionate about.\n\nWhat comics did you like as a kid?\n\nI had a Marvel encyclopedia. I didn\u2019t get access to real comic books until around the time Milestone, a comic publishing imprint that showcased African-American superheroes, came out. I remember it was cool to have characters that I could see myself in. When I discovered Comixology, a digital distributor of comics, I started reading again. My girlfriend at the time, who is now my wife, was an avid prose reader. We would be hanging by the pool, and she would read her books and I would read comics.\n\nHow did you go from liking comics to wanting to create them?\n\nI knew I wanted to do something that utilized creative storytelling. Digital comics were on the forefront of all that. You could do flip books and light animation and add soundscapes. Carl Reed, a co-founder of Lion Forge, was working in animation and was looking for the next thing, too. We got together with a couple of other guys and started exploring: Who are the players? What are they doing? Is the market saturated? We wanted to use digital as the litmus test for what you should print. You could tell the retailer: \u201cThis title sold well first digitally. We think people will look for it in the store to collect.\u201d\n\nWhy did you feel the timing was right for Lion Forge\u2019s diverse heroes?\n\nThe New 52 was launching at DC, and I remember distinctly they had relaunched Static Shock, which is cool because they brought that title to the forefront, but then they didn\u2019t have any black creators on it. I remember thinking, \u201cWhat is this?\u201d It was kind of like a reflection of what someone else thinks that an African-American person is, which is different from actually having more of an authentic representation. Whatever group we are representing, we are definitely having someone of that group be a part of it.\n\nHow did you approach creating these comics and catering to the audience?\n\nI feel like for everybody to participate, you have to have representation that looks like everyone in this country. We\u2019ve been careful to make sure that it is an inclusive line of characters. Kind of like the United Colors of Benetton [laughs], but it feels natural and organic. Another thing is not only looking at core comic book readers, but how can you reach those folks interested in comics but maybe haven\u2019t been invited in? Anybody who comes to our site or our catalog of books will find something there for them. I feel I achieved that goal in the last year with \u201cLighter Than My Shadow.\u201d My wife hasn\u2019t really picked up one of our books \u2014 other than when I\u2019ve asked her to. [Laughs.] She saw \u201cLighter Than My Shadow\u201d on my bedside table and wanted to read it. I\u2019ve truly passed the last mile here.\n\nWhy did you acquire The Beat, a blog covering the comic industry, founded by Heidi MacDonald?\n\nThe Beat acquisition was one of those opportunities to support something I believe that the industry needs. Comics journalism, especially the last few years, has kind of taken a turn. Comics Alliance just randomly shut its doors. Comic Book Resources has a little bit of journalism going on, but it became primarily a list site \u2014 and with very pervasive ads. Heidi was a one-woman show. There was an opportunity there to provide her with resources to continue what she was doing and to expand. I think there are a lot of stories that need to be told. I think there are a lot of creators out there that need a light shined on them.\n\nOrder Reprints | Today\u2019s Paper | Subscribe A version of this article appears in print on , on Page BU 3 of the New York edition with the headline: Telling the Stories That Need to Be Told\n\n\n\n\n\n", "keywords": ["comics", "comic", "lot", "book", "wanted", "forge", "lion", "need", "told", "books", "steward"], "polarity": 0.17362990019240018, "subjectivity": 0.49130491422158074},

Many Germans and Swedes now recognize \u2014 and some celebrate \u2014 the fact that their fellow citizens can have any skin color or religion. But the attempt to turn countries with monoethnic identities into truly multiethnic nations is a historically unique experiment, and so it should hardly come as a surprise that it has encountered some fierce resistance.\n\nThe situation in Canada and the United States, despite their histories as countries of immigration, has important similarities to that in Europe. Both have historically had rigid racial hierarchies. And in recent decades, both have made real steps toward overcoming these injustices: African-Americans, for example, are better represented in business and government than at any previous point in American history. This has made opposition to a more equal, multiethnic society more fervid among those who feel their privileges threatened. There is a sizable number of Americans for whom the idea of the nation remains synonymous with whiteness and Christianity.\n\nSo long as nationalism is associated with one particular ethnic or religious group, it will serve to exclude and disadvantage others. The only way to keep the destructive potential of nationalism in check is to fight for a society in which collective identity transcends ethnic and religious boundaries \u2014 one in which citizens from all religious or ethnic backgrounds are treated with the same respect as citizens from the majority group.\n\nTo effect this transformation is one of the great political challenges of our age. It requires principled resistance to right-wing nationalism, but it can succeed only if those who are most open to diversity abandon their hostility to other forms of nationalism.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

But for better or probably worse, it\u2019s easier to be moved by the suffering of people with whom we have some form of kinship. That is why nationalism remains one of the most powerful vehicles for expanding our circle of sympathy.\n\nAnother common reaction to the resurgence of nationalism has been to celebrate more narrow forms of collective identity, such as race or religion. At a time when many minority groups are under attack, it is, of course, crucial to defend them against discrimination. But it is also important to remember that such groups, too, are capable of oppressing their own members, for example by enforcing restrictive moral codes. That\u2019s why the only way to allow individuals true freedom to lead their lives is to preserve some form of political identity independent of the interests of particular cultural groups.\n\nConvinced that they would be unable to redirect nationalism toward their own ends, many of the most open-minded segments of society long ago gave up on the fight to determine its meaning. In countries like Germany and the United States, advocacy for the victims of prejudice has increasingly bled into a belief that the dark chapters of those countries\u2019 history make any form of nationalism deeply suspect. Instead of exhorting their fellow citizens to live up to their nations\u2019 highest ideals, many activists seem content with denouncing past and present injustices. This has allowed the bigots and racists to bend the meaning of the nation to their own sinister ends.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt\u2019s time to fight back. Nationalism can, and should, be reclaimed for liberals.\n\nA few political leaders have made a valiant start. Barack Obama has been an especially persuasive advocate of the idea that Americans should focus on what unites rather than what divides us and that the symbolism of the nation can inspire hope, even as we reckon with the injustices of American history. \u201cWhat greater expression of faith in the American experiment than this,\u201d Mr. Obama marveled as he stood on the spot in Selma, Ala. where civil rights protesters were beaten in 1965. \u201cWhat greater form of patriotism is there than the belief that America is not yet finished, that we are strong enough to be self-critical, that each successive generation can look upon our imperfections and decide that it is in our power to remake this nation to more closely align with our highest ideals?\u201d\n\nCampaigning for France\u2019s presidency last year, Emmanuel Macron expressed inclusive patriotism in an even more explicit form. \u201cI see Armenians, Italians, Algerians, Moroccans, Tunisians,\u201d he said at a rally in Marseille, a diverse city in southern France, \u201cBut what do I see? I see the people of Marseille! What do I see? I see the people of France!\u201d This, he added in an explicit repudiation of the exclusive nationalism propagated by the far-right National Front party, \u201cis what it means to be proud to be French!\u201d\n\nAmerican \u2014 and to a lesser degree European \u2014 political culture is pregnant with the symbols of inclusive patriotism. But while we have plenty of history to build on, we must also recognize that we are fighting to establish a kind of society for which there is no clear precedent.\n\nIn the United States, the model had once been a melting pot. But asking individuals to conform to one unified culture puts the price of admission to the nation too high. In Canada, the model is often said to be that of a salad bowl, in which the overall dish is enriched by the great variety of individual ingredients. But we can now see that this may be an overly idealized image of a society in which people feel that they have little in common across ethnic and religious divides.\n\nThere may not be a perfect culinary metaphor for the kind of country inclusive nationalists seek to create. But its contours should be obvious. It is a state in which all members have the same rights and opportunities irrespective of the group into which they are born or the culture to which they belong. It is a society in which people feel that they have something important in common because they seek to govern themselves together, pledge to help one another in an hour of need and recognize that these shared commitments are ultimately more consequential than any difference of color or creed. And it is a culture that does not shy away from celebrating the nobility of this collective identity \u2014 embracing the nation\u2019s flag not because we claim never to have failed our compatriots in the past but because we aspire to realize a common future fair to all.\n\nIt would be tempting to say that this kind of patriotism has little in common with the nationalism that is now ascendant around the world. Patriotism, some philosophers argue, should be understood as an innocent love of country that is inclusive at home and cooperative abroad. Nationalism, by contrast, excludes other ethnicities and stands in competition with the interests of other countries.\n\nBut it is too clever by half to pretend that we can safely stoke the good aspects of patriotism without ever running the danger of exacerbating the worst aspects of nationalism. For the kind of patriotism I am proposing is not a completely different form of collective identity; it is, rather, one that proudly stands in competition with the exclusionary politics on display from Washington to Moscow to Beijing.\n\nNationalism is like a half-wild beast. As long as it remains under our control, it can be of tremendous use. But if we abandon it, others are sure to step in, prodding and baiting the beast to bring out its most ferocious side. For all the well-founded misgivings about it, we have little choice but to domesticate it as best we can.", "keywords": ["reclaim", "form", "identity", "common", "patriotism", "political", "society", "religious", "liberals", "nationalism", "nation", "collective"], "polarity": 0.14129125602529854, "subjectivity": 0.47932204517310895},

So instead of seeing my full self in Meg, I ended up cherry-picking the traits to which I could relate: her bravery and intelligence, or even more rare her feelings of abandonment and anger caused by her father\u2019s absence.\n\nAyana Mathis, the African-American author of the best-selling novel \u201cThe Twelve Tribes of Hattie,\u201d had a similar disconnect with this novel even though it remains her favorite book, alongside Mildred D.

Ms. Reid described Meg as \u201can African-American girl that is smart, that is beautiful and that basically realizes that she is enough.\u201d Through this awareness, the actress added, Meg \u201cjust taps into her superpowers to be able to save her dad, her brother and save the world.\u201d\n\nThis revision \u2014 alongside the film\u2019s broader multiracial cast, which includes Mindy Kaling, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Reese Witherspoon and Oprah Winfrey \u2014 not only expands the feminist reach of L\u2019Engle\u2019s original vision, but also directly challenges the overwhelming absence of girls of color as leads in Hollywood films in general, and science-fiction films in particular. As recently as 2012, controversy greeted Amandla Stenberg when she played Rue in the first \u201cHunger Games\u201d movie. Rue was a black character in the dystopian novel it was based on, but fans seemed not to realize it and complained loudly about the casting. Ms. Reid\u2019s turn as Meg, by contrast, seems to have only increased fan anticipation for the movie.\n\nMore radically, Ms. DuVernay\u2019s choice for Meg helps redefine our notions of the universal. Rather than assume children of color will seamlessly identify with Meg as we do with the book or with the young, white heroines of the \u201cHunger Games\u201d or \u201cDivergent\u201d franchise, this film gives us a different, racially inflected female future and present.\n\nAnd that changes how I now appreciate the book.\n\nIt is still my favorite from childhood, but now, rather than contort myself into Meg, I am able to see how the novel\u2019s play with time and space continues to influence me as an African-American writer. I\u2019m obsessed with how people, events and cultural objects from the past shape our understandings of race and gender in the present. \u201cA Wrinkle in Time\u201d might not ask the same questions that I do now, but it was the first novel I ever read that explored multiple time dimensions and gave me permission to imagine history as incomplete, unfolding, and a phenomenon with hopes that can be taken up by successive generations.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter I was done with the novel this time, I put my copy on my 5-year-old daughter\u2019s bookshelf, for I am comforted by what she is now able to find in \u201cA Wrinkle in Time.\u201d Though we contemporary viewers and readers are unable to engage in interplanetary travel like Meg, Ms. DuVernay\u2019s version takes us somewhere even more substantive. By emphasizing diversity over dystopia, her film does not simply warn against the dangers of who we might become, but celebrates the vast richness of who we already are.", "keywords": ["saw", "africanamerican", "work", "wrinkle", "hard", "ms", "films", "novel", "childrens", "meg", "book", "color", "york", "sign"], "polarity": 0.09736605385956033, "subjectivity": 0.4660398043514926},

The powerful message was that this black man and his white fianc\u00e9e were facing her family (and the world) and saying that was O.K. I think it was the first time I thought to myself: Love trumps color, race, culture, and even fear.\n\n\u2014 Vanessa Ricot, project manager, marketing\n\nMy mother was American and my father Colombian, and Lucy and Ricky on \u201cI love Lucy\u201d were the first ethnically mixed, semi-bilingual couple I had seen on TV. The show, which I saw reruns of as a child in the 1980s, introduced ideas like culture clash; it lightly made fun of American cluelessness about other countries, in the figures of Fred and Ethel.\n\nA comic genius, Lucy used slapstick and crocodile tears to combat her husband\u2019s machismo \u2014 and when you look at how Latina actors in her position are still forced to play stereotypes of the docile wife or the sexy spitfire, that still looks radical today.\n\n\u2014 Annie Correal, reporter, metropolitan news\n\nI am not athletic, British or Indian. But Parminder Nagra, who played Jess Bhamra in \u201cBend it Like Beckham,\u201d was close enough.

She was everything the tween in me wanted the chance to be.\n\n\u2014 Fahima Haque, editor, social media\n\nI didn\u2019t see myself in someone who looked particularly like me, but rather in someone who matched my passion for the performing arts.

Those were also the years when the \u201cmodel minority\u201d myth was really grating me, and I was drawn to transgressive portrayals of Asians. Jon Moritsugu\u2019s movies, in all their anarchic glory, were a revelation, especially \u201cTerminal U.S.A.,\u201d which somehow made it onto TV in the 1990s despite all its gore and drug use.\n\nLater, Justin Lin\u2019s \u201cBetter Luck Tomorrow\u201d depicted a group of Asian-American high-school students who fall into a world of crime. These are not the greatest movies ever made, but they meant a lot to me because they ignored the standard immigrant-experience formula and seemed to say: \u201cYeah, we\u2019re Asian.

It\u2019s hard enough finding movies about queer women or about Asian-American women, so seeing both identities woven together in one film was incredible. Fourteen years after the movie came out, it remains alone at the center of such a Venn diagram of underrepresentation.\n\n\u2014 Kathy Zhang, analytics manager\n\nI was so excited in kindergarten to see a free-spirited, brown woman running around and calling the shots in \u201cPocahontas.\u201d I repeatedly watched the videotape, and my mother let me grow my hair down, like Pocahontas.

I was a black kid who played sports, and I looked up to athletes: Tito Trinidad, Ronaldo, Michael Johnson, Thierry Henry and Roy Jones Jr. These men of color were the best at what they did, and they wore their excellence and their beauty unflinchingly. I never noticed anything similar on the screen until Will Smith in \u201cIndependence Day\u201d and Wesley Snipes in \u201cBlade.\u201d When they were saving the world, they resembled the superheroes already in my life.\n\n\u2014 Greg Howard, reporter, metropolitan news\n\nI have never had any inclination to become a police officer, and as a child, I had never been to California.

Truthfully, Foley\u2019s race was not at the fore of my mind when I watched the show, but it was inspiring to see that a natural leader could look just like me.\n\n\u2014 John Eligon, race reporter, national news\n\nDays before the United States dropped bombs on Baghdad in January 1991, \u201cNot Without My Daughter,\u201d the crudest possible film portrait of Iraq\u2019s neighbor, Iran, was released. I was too young to fully understand this strange convergence of events. But I know now that they\u2019re linked for another reason: Hollywood\u2019s systemic demonization of Arabs, Persians and Muslims in general has made it much easier for Washington, the media and the public to start and support wars with no end in sight.

But he has used his entire career to tell America a story about itself that it does not want to hear: that racism exists today, and is pervasive outside of the Deep South. And he has worked ceaselessly toward two intertwined, impossible goals. First, the demand for equal rights for all. The second is about securing his legacy as the Martin Luther King of the North.\n\n\u201cWhat I want it to be is I helped urbanize the King movement,\u201d Mr. Sharpton said. \u201cI was the one that could bring the King movement into the Northern, urban centers.\u201d But where Dr. King\u2019s activism led to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Mr. Sharpton\u2019s efforts haven\u2019t amounted to national reform.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Sharpton, 63, figured he\u2019d be retired by now. He thought he\u2019d keep his Sunday-morning MSNBC program, \u201cPoliticsNation,\u201d and his daily radio show, \u201cKeepin\u2019 It Real.\u201d He said he was ready to name a successor to his civil rights organization, the National Action Network, and the marching, strategizing and agitating that came with it. All that was left to do was build a civil rights museum in Harlem. But riding off into a life of punditry isn\u2019t an option with Mr. Trump in office. Mr. Sharpton said he and his allies thought they were poised to help a President Hillary Clinton pass national police reform legislation. His mission is now different, and more modest.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to preserve what you\u2019ve got done,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will not matter if he revokes the Voting Rights Act, and the Civil Rights Act of Dr. King. You need to preserve the racial profiling laws, and police reform like stop and frisk,\u201d he continued. \u201cOtherwise, it\u2019ll be a bygone era.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nNow 133 pounds, Mr. Sharpton is less than half the man he was for much of his life. A morning salad and banana serve as his only real sustenance for the day, and in my time with him, he drank nothing but green tea \u2014 not even water. His flamboyant conk is now steely gray, slicked back over his thinning crown. He\u2019s quick to joke, but he rarely laughs. He has long since replaced his sweats with bespoke suits.\n\nBut the new Al Sharpton is the same person he always was.\n\nAlfred Charles Sharpton Jr. was born in 1954 to a middle-class family who had a house in a nice neighborhood in Queens. At 4, before he even knew how to read, young Al began preaching, and often practiced at home in his mother\u2019s robe. When he was just a boy, his mother connected Al with two pastors, Bishop F.D. Washington and the Rev. Dr. Bill Jones. They called him Boy Wonder, and he toured the country preaching before he was even a teenager. In 1967, Dr. Jones introduced the young preacher to a 26-year-old civil-rights activist named Jesse Jackson. Mr. Jackson took him under his wing, and Al decided he wanted to spend his life like the men who looked after him, fighting for civil rights in the prophetic tradition of Dr. King, who was assassinated when Mr. Sharpton was 13.\n\nIn 1971, when he was 16, Mr. Sharpton founded his first civil rights organization, the National Youth Movement, with money from Bayard Rustin, the chief organizer of the 1963 March on Washington. He met James Brown, who adopted him as his godson in 1973; for most of the next decade, Mr. Sharpton was always at the singer\u2019s side. If Jesse Jackson taught Mr. Sharpton how to organize, it was James Brown who taught him how to perform.\n\n\u201cI would watch what moves and what songs excited people, and I would take notes,\u201d Mr. Sharpton told me. \u201cBecause you\u2019ve got to keep people\u2019s attention.\u201d", "keywords": ["mr", "al", "dr", "act", "reconsidered", "rights", "sharpton", "national", "king", "civil", "movement"], "polarity": 0.10926573426573427, "subjectivity": 0.386868686868687},

Books by Women of Color Rewrite Old Cultural Scripts                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/02/books/review/ya-women-of-color-clayton-adeyemi.html", "text": "Now, more than anytime in recent history, we\u2019re hearing the triumphant roar of women of color as they break down longstanding barriers in art, film and literature. In young adult literature in particular, inventive, international stories told in newly empowered women\u2019s voices are claiming their rightful place at the table. Take these five new Y.A. books, ranging from fantasy to realistic fiction to memoir. In these authors\u2019 hands, non-Western sensibilities might reign in a vivid and original Yoruban religion-based world, or classical settings might be reinterpreted to create a universe in which beauty is not tied to race. A heartbreaking fictional front row seat to the Syrian refugee emergency is offset by a humorous true tale of growing up an Iranian-American immigrant without a green card. And a very modern romance proves that, despite divides both cultural and digital, love still wins. So do Y.A. readers, when it comes to seeing exhilaratingly new kinds of characters sharing space.\n\nIn Dhonielle Clayton\u2019s lavish fantasy THE BELLES (Freeform, $17.99; ages 14 to 17), a thing of beauty is only temporary. The decadent island society of Orl\u00e9ans is home to a select group of sisters born with the disconcerting ability to perform plastic surgery without the plastic. As \u201cdescendants of the goddess of beauty,\u201d the Belles have a fuzzily explained magical \u201carcana\u201d in their blood that allows them to temporarily change the physical appearance of the native Gris, who are cursed with gray skin and red eyes. After a childhood of training, the teenage Belles are introduced to upper-class society and tasked with transforming the hair, skin and bone structure of the race-fluid rich and royal. But when the rebellious Belle Camellia uncovers a plot by the truly vile Princess Sophia to enslave her and her sisters, she sows the seeds of a grass-roots revolution that is bound to blossom more fully in the inevitable sequel.\n\nPhoto\n\nClayton, a co-founder of the We Need Diverse Books organization, has created an opulent mash-up setting, which seems to be a cherry-picked combination of 18th-century France, Japan and the antebellum American South. If it never quite coalesces into a seamless cultural whole, readers seduced by the page-turning palace intrigue and the vivid food and clothing descriptions won\u2019t notice or care.\n\nMagic also lies dormant in the platelets of chosen teenagers in the Nigerian-American Tomi Adeyemi\u2019s debut, CHILDREN OF BLOOD AND BONE (Holt, $18.99; ages 12 and up). But these diviners are no debutantes. Born with snow white hair and deep brown skin in the imaginary country of Or\u00efsha, young diviners morph into mighty, magic-wielding maji, or magicians, at 13. For centuries they relied on their powers (which Adeyemi based on aspects of the religion of the Yoruban people of West Africa). All that ended when the nonmagical King Saran ordered the slaughter of all adult majis. But when a mysterious scroll falls into the hands of Amari, a defiant princess, and Z\u00e9lie, a tenacious diviner warrior, the two young women set out on a thrilling, death-defying journey to restore magic and take back the throne.\n\nPhoto\n\nBlack Girl Magic, indeed! It\u2019s no surprise that this epic trilogy opener has already been optioned for film. Full of cinematic action sequences (the most memorable of them set almost entirely underwater and employing an army of the dead) and creatures worthy of Star Wars (horse-size \u201clionaires\u201d have saber teeth and horns), it storms the boundaries of the imagination. Yet it also confronts the conscience. Adeyemi\u2019s brutally depicted war between the noble, lighter-skinned kosidans and the enslaved, darker-skinned majis poses thought-provoking questions about race, class and authority that hold up a warning mirror to our sharply divided society.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Tareq is a Syrian refugee whose perilous journey is narrated by the voice of Destiny, characterized as a kindly, prosaic entity. After Tareq\u2019s mother, grandmother and four of his siblings are killed by a bomb, he and his father flee to Turkey with his remaining sister, Susan. They hopscotch from Turkey to Greece, Serbia, Slovenia, Austria and finally to Germany, where he finds a fragile safety. Along the way he witnesses beheadings and drownings, but also experiences the kindness of aid workers like Alexia, an American student. Abawi, a foreign news correspondent, does an admirable job of showing the grim horror of refugee life. But her efforts are occasionally undermined by cartoonish villains (\u201cYou tink you will be saved? Who will save you? Captain America is not real, just movies\u201d) and by some of Destiny\u2019s well-meaning but obvious platitudes: \u201cWhen you truly love someone, their life means more to you than your own.\u201d These interruptions may pull readers out of the story, though perhaps that distance is necessary for adolescents trying to process something as bleak and overwhelming as the Syrian refugee crisis.\n\nPhoto\n\nOf course, once refugees finally arrive in their adopted country, new problems arise. Until she was 13, Sara Saedi, an Iranian-American television writer and the author of the memoir AMERICANIZED: Rebel Without a Green Card (Random House, $17.99, ages 12 and up), was cheerfully oblivious of her family\u2019s immigration status. After her older sister breaks the news that they are \u201cillegal,\u201d Saedi suffers through the usual teenage rites of passage at her Silicon Valley high school (unibrow management, pimple wars, pot smoking) with the added pressure of possible deportation hanging over her head. Saedi adroitly and humorously uses these universal pubescent ordeals to contextualize Iranian culture and the immigrant experience. A memory of being teased about her eyebrow in ninth grade expands into a discussion of beauty norms: When her mother praises her for being hairless, \u201cshe meant by Persian woman standards. I was still hairy by everyone else\u2019s standards.\u201d And she has the sobering realization that pot is a privilege American teenagers can enjoy, but not undocumented kids: \u201cIf I got caught, I\u2019d have a criminal record that could be grounds for deportation.\u201d Very funny but never flippant, Saedi mixes \u201990s pop culture references, adolescent angst and Iranian history into an intimate, informative narrative that thoroughly defies current divisive views on immigration.\n\nPhoto\n\nMary H.K. Choi\u2019s blushingly tender and piquant debut novel, EMERGENCY CONTACT (Simon & Schuster, $17.99; ages 14 and up), about two isolated, misfit college students from Austin who fall in love via text message explores our emotional rather than geographical divides. In \u201cEmergency Contact,\u201d a Korean-American would-be writer named Penny keeps everyone at a distance, the result of living with a single, oversharing mom she calls \u201cthe equivalent of \u2026 human glitter.\u201d But when she rescues Sam, a half-German, half-Polish student filmmaker, from the sidewalk during a panic attack, she becomes his \u201cemergency contact,\u201d and he hers. Their charged, initial banter on text soon develops into increasingly personal exchanges about art, death, unstable moms and pregnant ex-girlfriends. Yet their burgeoning bond keeps stalling out. Burned by past relationships and millennial-ly tethered to their devices, they struggle to connect romantically IRL. Sam \u201ccouldn\u2019t imagine the space Penny would take up in his life if she sprang out of his phone,\u201d and Penny admits \u201cSam was her phone and her phone was Sam.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nChoi, a culture correspondent for HBO\u2019s Vice News, inserts timely issues like sexual assault, cultural appropriation and even DACA into her characters\u2019 intimate conversations, but it is her examination of digital vs. F2F communication that feels the most immediate.

Credit Mike Cohen for The New York Times\n\nThe role of the chief executive has never been more complex \u2014 or more consequential.\n\nBusiness leaders today are reshaping the internet, reimagining health care, upending transportation and more. But being a chief executive is no longer just about running a company. It means taking political stands on everything from immigration to gun rights. It means weighing in on tariffs and taxes \u2014 all while balancing short-term profits with long-term goals, dealing with activist investors and attracting talented employees.\n\nIn an effort to better understand the world\u2019s top chief executives \u2014 where they\u2019re coming from and how they deal with the challenges they face \u2014 The New York Times is bringing back Corner Office.\n\nFor nearly 10 years, Corner Office featured conversations about leadership and management with some 500 senior executives. The new Corner Office will build on this foundation and also cover the big issues of the day, from climate change to artificial intelligence. We\u2019ll be talking to prominent chief executives at big companies, innovators at lesser-known start-ups and organizational leaders in philanthropy, sports and the arts.\n\nWe want you to join the conversation. Let us know whom we should interview, and what questions you want answered below. And stay tuned as we bring Corner Office to life with multimedia, how-to guides and live events.\n\nAs we considered whom to interview first, Kenneth C. Frazier, the chief executive of Merck, was right at the top of the list. Mr. Frazier has a powerful personal story and has built an exceptional career.\n\nRaised in a poor neighborhood in Philadelphia, Mr. Frazier attended Penn State University and Harvard Law School. He joined Merck in 1992, defending the company against major lawsuits while resisting calls to slash research and development budgets.\n\nLast year, Mr. Frazier made headlines as the first chief executive to resign from a presidential advisory council following Mr. Trump\u2019s equivocating response to an outburst of white nationalist violence in Charlottesville, Va. As perhaps the most prominent black chief executive in the country, his stance carried powerful symbolism.\n\nThe Times published an article last month about Mr. Frazier\u2019s decision to resign from the advisory role. This interview, which was condensed and edited for clarity, was conducted at Merck\u2019s headquarters in Kenilworth, N.J.\n\nYou once said that even though your father was a janitor, you believed he could have been a C.E.O.\n\nMy father was born in the year 1900 in South Carolina, and he grew up at a time where being an African-American child in the American South was to be deprived of access to anything close to a reasonable education. He only had three years of formal education, but he was self-taught. He read two newspapers a day. He could\u2019ve done a lot of things had he been born when I was born.\n\nTell me about his father.\n\nMy grandfather on my paternal side, Richard Frazier, was born in the late 1850s, and therefore was born into slavery, but was a sharecropper in South Carolina for his entire life. And one of the great things about my grandfather was that he sent my father north before he reached the age of maturity so that he, too, wouldn\u2019t become indebted to the land.\n\nHow did your parents raise you?\n\nI had a fantastic upbringing by two parents who cared deeply about their children, but more importantly believed that anything was possible for their children, and in some ways almost brainwashed us to be successful. They believed that despite the history of this country as it related to African-Americans, that for my siblings and I, that there would be tremendous opportunity. They also instilled that it was our responsibility to take advantage of the opportunities that they did not have.\n\nWhat drew you to the study of law?\n\nI\u2019ve always admired lawyers who use their power to affect social change, and Thurgood Marshall was always a childhood hero of mine.\n\nAfter graduating from Harvard Law School, you went to work at Drinker Biddle & Reath. Why there?\n\nI chose that firm in large part because they had a reputation of doing a lot of pro bono work. When I was at the firm, I read about the need in South Africa for law professors and lawyers to come from the U.S., because black law students in South Africa were obviously during apartheid only allowed to go to second-rate law schools.\n\nI lived one whole semester in Soweto. It was completely lawless. There were no streetlights. It was a completely separated area where people were contained, because the South African government\u2019s job, as it saw it, was to separate blacks from whites.\n\nBut what I remember more than anything else was interacting with people who their entire lives had been told that they were second class, that they were inferior, and how hard it was to get particularly the men to speak up in audible tones, because they had been in many ways told that their voice was not worth listening to. In addition to trying to teach people the substantive legal issues, it was a lot about trying to instill self-confidence.\n\n\u201cThe most important role of a leader is to safeguard the heritage and values of the company.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Ken Frazier\n\nYou also represented James Willie \u201cBo\u201d Cochran, a death row inmate. What was your first impression of his case?\n\nMy first reaction was, \u201cI\u2019m much too busy to take on another piece of pro bono litigation.\u201d But there were two younger lawyers in the firm who heard about the case, and they came to me and frankly they sort of shamed me into doing it.\n\nYou eventually won his freedom. What did that mean to you?\n\nIt was the high point of my professional career. This is a man who was facing an execution date for a crime he did not commit. And what I will never forget about Bo was that he had no sense of recrimination whatsoever. He was just thankful for every day that he had as a free man. It sort of reminds me of Nelson Mandela in the sense that he was able to live his life going forward without regard to trying to even scores.\n\nOne of the things that defined your early years at Merck was the defense against lawsuits over Vioxx, a painkiller that posed heart risk and was pulled off the market. Are there lessons to be learned from the way you approached that?\n\nThe central allegation that was underneath the Vioxx litigation was that this company put profit before patient safety. That went to the core of who we are as a company, and there was no way that we could allow that story to be unchallenged. We did not want Vioxx to become a verbal shorthand, like an Enron or something of that nature, for corporate wrongdoing. The most important role of a leader is to safeguard the heritage and values of the company.\n\nHow do you balance the pressure to deliver profits to public shareholders and also to make lifesaving drugs?\n\nI actually don\u2019t see that big a conflict between meeting the needs of shareholders and meeting the needs of society.\n\nVery early on in my tenure there was a lot of pressure being put on pharmaceutical C.E.O.s to cut their research budgets. And we value R & D as a company. It\u2019s who we are. It\u2019s the core of what we do. I made the decision that I wasn\u2019t going to cut our R & D budget, and that had some short-term negative consequences in terms of share price. But by taking those actions I think we were able to show that we really did care about what we said we were about as a company.\n\nThere are lots of examples of companies that have lost their way because they\u2019ve sort of lost their soul, which is a funny word to use, but companies do have souls.\n\nLast year, after President Trump\u2019s remarks following the violence in Charlottesville, you resigned from one of his advisory councils. What happened?\n\nIn that moment the president\u2019s response was one that I felt was not in concordance with my views, and I didn\u2019t think they were in concordance with the views that we claim to hold as a country. It was my view that to not take a stand on this would be viewed as a tacit endorsement of what had happened and what was said. I think words have consequences, and I think actions have consequences. I just felt that as a matter of my own personal conscience, I could not remain.\n\nWhat did you learn from the whole experience?\n\nC.E.O.s need to be very thoughtful and sober about the positions that they take publicly. Ultimately, if you believe strongly in something, you ought to say it, and you ought to say it in a very clear way.\n\nBill Horne in Newtonville, Mass., asks...\n\n\u201cIn what ways if any has your representation of prisoners on death row influenced your decisions as C.E.O.?\u201d\n\nWhat drew me to Merck was that the company\u2019s ethos had the same feel that pro bono work has, which is that you\u2019re really committed to serving your fellow human beings. I worked for 10 years to save one person\u2019s life in the context of the death penalty. Here we can make decisions every day with the stroke of the pen that can make lots of people\u2019s lives longer and healthier.\n\nHow do you prioritize your time?\n\nThere are three things that the C.E.O. should be focused on. Number one is that sense of purpose and direction that the company needs, making sure that that\u2019s always clear and people know what we\u2019re all about. The second thing is capital allocation. We only have so many resources. Making sure that you\u2019re putting those resources where you have the greatest opportunity. And the third, which I think by far is the most important, is to make sure that you have the right people in the most important jobs inside the company.\n\nWhat advice would you give to college graduates?\n\nI think people should seek adventure in life, as opposed to just allowing their ambitions to drive where they want to end up. Lots of people say, \u201cTell me what are the steps to get from here to the C.E.O.\u2019s office.\u201d I can say honestly I never sought to be a C.E.O. But what I\u2019ve always wanted was a new challenge, what I call an adventure. Seek adventure. Seek excitement in what you do.\n\nDavid Gelles is the Corner Office columnist and a business reporter.

The Baptist part is inherited, like baldness or dimples: Both of my grandfathers and three of my uncles were Baptist preachers, and my parents met as graduate students at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. Genes aside, the church \u2014 plastic chairs, pilling carpet and grape juice for communion \u2014 was the organizing institution of my childhood, where I met my closest friends and most of the significant adults in my life.\n\nChurch attendance has been in generational decline. I began calling around, exploring whether people in small towns were looking for community elsewhere and, with the white nationalist rallies so often in the news, whether young white people were looking for meaning in the grim sanctuaries of the alt-right.\n\nBut I kept hearing about something different. Pastors, theologians and sociologists were talking of how black worshipers were leaving white-majority churches. They were leaving quietly and not en masse, a family here, a single person there. But it was happening everywhere, a movement large enough for some to see the unraveling of decades of efforts at racial reconciliation.\n\nI would find someone on Facebook, a black worshiper who had posted about leaving her mostly white church, and then I would find someone in the same situation halfway across the country. They would both think they were going through this alone, yet the accounts would be remarkably similar, the timelines nearly identical, even some of the words and phrases the same. There had been, I discovered, some sharp reporting about this, particularly from the writer Deborah Jian Lee, but not as much as you would expect for an experience that seemed to be this broadly shared.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPeople spoke to me of being tired, let down, heartbroken. Political and cultural partitions that they had long overlooked at worship time now overshadowed every service. The realizations almost always began with the death of Trayvon Martin in 2012, and a sense that white church leaders or fellow worshipers did not want to talk about how a black teenager walking home from a 7-Eleven could end up dead. Sometimes the preacher would privately express sympathy, but also concern about how his white congregation would take it. Maybe there would be a meeting.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

She takes comfort from local efforts like a project in Utica, N.Y., where Bosnian Muslim immigrants and local Unitarian Christians watched a Super Bowl together. She applauds aggressive racial integration programs like those run by the American military. She cites her own teaching experience in small seminars at Yale, where students from divergent backgrounds overcame disagreements to achieve mutual respect, sometimes even friendship.\n\nPhoto\n\nYet the scholar in Chua acknowledges that these individual experiences offer less of a social lesson than she would wish.\n\n\u201cStudies show that minimal or superficial exposure to out-group members can actually worsen group division. \u2026 Negative interactions with people from other groups also increase group hostility. So merely putting members of different groups in the same space is not enough and indeed can aggravate political tribalism.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Chua falls back on the very attitude to which she turned her sharply skeptical gaze at the beginning of the book: the conviction that the United States was, is and will remain an exceptional nation, different from all the others. In her introduction, Chua remarked that the United States as a supertribal entity indifferent to ethnicity and culture became at best a partial reality only a generation ago. By book\u2019s end, however, the battered ideal has been polished and refurbished.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Will we, telling ourselves \u2018These immigrants are different,\u2019 be the weak link, the first generation to fail? Will we forget who we are?\u201d That\u2019s inspiring, and even more so are the citations of Martin Luther King Jr., Lin-Manuel Miranda and Langston Hughes that finish the book.\n\nInspiring \u2014 but not wholly reassuring. A lot of the interest of \u201cPolitical Tribes\u201d comes from the strong sense it emanates of an author arguing with herself. Chua both condemns tribalism and respects its power. She insists that the United States alone of nations among the earth has often transcended it \u2014 and then presents impressive contrary evidence from the past and the present. Chua reckons with the many tribalisms of the American past: ethnic, religious and racial. She hopes for a future in which tribalism fades \u2014 even as she mercilessly details its accumulating strength.\n\nAs Chua notes, tribes can coalesce out of previously unrelated pieces. Immigrants to Europe from North Africa, the Middle East and South Asia \u2014 of different languages, ethnicities, folkways and religious practices \u2014 raised children who created for themselves a new identity as post-ethnic Muslims. ISIS, as Chua mordantly observes, is in its own way a melting pot, bringing together young men and women from across Europe, Asia and the Americas to fight for a new ideology. She quotes a New York Times article about young British girls lured to ISIS. For them, \u201cIslam is punk rock.\u201d\n\nTribes can be created by fission as well as by fusion. Chua suggests that in the United States, divisions that would once have been understood as class divides have been reinterpreted in our time as cultural, even when they are not ethnic. \u201cWhite Americans often hold their biggest disdain for other white Americans \u2014 the ones on the opposite side of the cultural divide.\u201d\n\nThese fast-evolving and ever-changing identities may look contingent from the outside. They feel overwhelmingly powerful to those inside. Chua repeatedly scolds American policymakers for underestimating the importance of ethnocultural identity in Vietnam in the 1960s, Venezuela in the 1990s and Afghanistan in the 2000s. Through her book pulses an evident worry that tribal claims are now overpowering national ones within the United States. If she cannot quite bring herself to make her own anxieties explicit \u2014 or figure out what if anything to do to address them \u2014 she is hardly alone. As the rise of Donald Trump over more conventional politicians has so emphatically proved: Worsening social divisions are much easier to exploit than to explain or redress.", "keywords": ["white", "states", "different", "chua", "battle", "means", "united", "american", "immigrants", "past", "york", "young"], "polarity": 0.07605747665988627, "subjectivity": 0.3744132373650447},

The overall poverty rate remains about the same today as it was 50 years ago; the total number of poor people has increased from over 25 million to well over 40 million, more than the population of California.\n\nMeanwhile, the rich have profited at the expense of most working Americans. Today, the top 1 percent receive 52 percent of all new income. Rich people are healthier and live longer. They get a better education, which produces greater gains in income. And their greater economic power translates into greater political power.\n\nFive Indicators America of the 1960s contrasted with the most recent available data.

I\u2019d love to jump right in and hear your aspirations for Prairie View. What do you hope to accomplish in your time as president? I assume you had many offers to lead other colleges. Why was Prairie View different?\n\nRuth Simmons: Well, I\u2019m a native of Texas, and one of the things that I did when I returned to Houston after I retired from Brown was think about the ways I could use my experience to help the community. I started with small ventures in the city, but I hadn\u2019t thought really that another university would be in my life. But when I was approached by Prairie View, I thought immediately about its significant impact on my brother, who went there. And what Dillard did for me.\n\nI grew up in a segregated neighborhood in Grapeland, Tex., with very little experience with the world. The transition that Dillard enabled for me was extremely valuable. As an undergraduate, I began to grow a sense of confidence that helped me move from a fairly insular environment to a bigger stage when I went to graduate school.\n\nMy aspirations for Prairie View are to essentially make sure the university is continuing to do the same thing for students today that it did for my brother \u2014 and Dillard did for me. And that is to offer the advantage of a strong education that will prepare students for the careers they want, in a social and cultural context that helps them develop the confidence to perform after graduation.\n\nAs president, that means focusing on time-honored strategies to success that apply to universities everywhere: worrying about the faculty who are recruited here, the campus experience, and whether we are providing the leadership and internship opportunities that students need. It means worrying about the reputation of the university. It\u2019s obviously a much more competitive world today than it was when I was a student, but the underlying work to move the university to a level of achievement that makes students and alumni proud is the same.\n\nM.J.: What do you see as some of the major challenges facing historically black colleges and universities?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nR.S.: The general challenge for H.B.C.U.s is not unlike the problem many universities face today, and that is the financial model. Being tuition dependent has become a large problem for all universities. H.B.C.U.s are dependent on raising money, but that is a reality that most universities obviously face. So it very much depends on the question of whether the schools have a good-enough foundation because of secure financing. When it comes to the federal government\u2019s role in supporting H.B.C.U.s, I think we don\u2019t yet understand the extent to which they will be affected by the changes in Washington today. To say that many are not hopeful in this moment is an understatement. We just don\u2019t know.\n\nFrankly, that\u2019s why I advocate for developing enough financial independence to secure the future of our institutions. That means looking for different revenue streams, looking to increase our ability to raise funds and finding alternate programs that help to bring more income into our university. The only strategy cannot be to persistently raise tuition, making college outside the reach of many families.\n\nM.J.: You\u2019ve led several institutions that are all very different from each other, and the topic of leadership is something you\u2019ve talked a lot about. In another interview with The Times you said that it\u2019s much easier to lead people \u201cif you convey the underlying principles.\u201d Can you elaborate?\n\nR.S.: One thing that I\u2019ve learned is that the perceptions of what it takes to be a leader are often based on prototypical models that don\u2019t have much truth in reality. People look at the institutions that I have led and they see dissimilarities. I see similarities. When people think in terms of leadership, they\u2019re often thinking about the kind of specific skills needed for different types of enterprises. I think of leadership as more of a disposition \u2014 the ability to step into a situation to learn about the history of the enterprise, the opportunities that it faces, the culture that exists and the people who are served by it. To look at all of that, to listen to stakeholders and then to think about how that enterprise or institution should best be served. There is no one model of leadership if you approach it that way. What I have tried to do wherever I go is to start where the institution is rather than try to import particularly rigid constructs from other places. In that sense, I think a leader is more than anything else a facilitator. A person who is able to come in to show a community a picture of what it is, to provide some insight into what it could be \u2014 how it could be different or improved perhaps \u2014 and then enlist the help of people who are there and others who support that institution in order to move forward together.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nI don\u2019t subscribe to the model of hero leadership, which is identifying somebody who can come in and have magical powers and then wield the wand and fix things that have not been fixable before. I don\u2019t see that. I think leadership is a community affair.\n\nM.J.: That makes sense. So how do you approach educating the current generation of students at Prairie View to lead in the way you described?\n\nR.S.: People today are fond of leadership programs that theorize about the profile and tenets of leadership. And students anxiously get involved in those programs. I rather think that our entire campuses are incubators of leadership even without the formality of such programs because if we\u2019re doing what we should be doing, we are acclimating students to an environment in which they have to learn to work with others who are very different from themselves. And that seems to me to be the first requirement of leadership. To actually learn to work with people in a respectful and inclusive way is inordinately important. A campus provides one of the best opportunities for people to be able to do that because you sit in class alongside people whom you initially don\u2019t know. You are discussing your ideas, having people respond to them and often rejecting what you\u2019re saying. You are joining organizations that have certain aims that are being advanced by the collective, so you\u2019re learning how to facilitate. You are asked to step into leadership roles either through student government or organizations. Even in the classroom context you might play a leadership role. You have to learn to express yourself, to be convincing, to write out your ideas, to be more thoughtful than you\u2019d ordinarily be. All of those things are components of leadership.\n\nM.J.: Some would argue that social media, or perhaps disagreements over the concept of safe spaces, have made it more challenging for people to come together and to work together.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nR.S.: Yeah, I would say that people frequently say that, but that has certainly not been my experience. I would say that in my days as a student, the tensions were higher, the disagreements were greater, the separation among us was certainly more pronounced. And people are kind of inventing a new narrative, that things are so much worse today than they were in the past. I don\u2019t buy that. I think we have new terminology, because the modern sciences of psychology and sociology and so forth and modern media have enabled us to peer into areas that we were not able to see as easily as before. And so when you have social media and all of the ways in which people can now say whatever they want to say \u2014 in an unartful or offensive way \u2014 that turns the volume up to be sure. But it doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t there before.\n\nI would say that the current situation ought to give us much more practice in how to engage with each other because it is not underground. It\u2019s out front, it\u2019s in the open. The media today and the things that are being reported should be upsetting or troubling to students, my goodness. But it may be an even better opportunity to engage students.\n\nAs a teacher, as an educator, I would say these times are especially fertile for teaching the skills that are needed in a world in which there are many types of people, many perspectives and so forth. Students don\u2019t need to feel silenced by the current situation. When students at Brown came to me and said, you know, they were hurt because somebody asked them about their hair, and they were tired of that and they didn\u2019t want any part of it, I would say, \u201cWell, that\u2019s just too bad!\u201d Somebody asked you about your hair, tell them about your hair. You are in college not to hide from that. You\u2019re there to teach the world about yourself, you\u2019re there to learn about others and to teach them about who you are. So I\u2019d rather think this whole notion of protecting people from that is something that we have to take in hand and deal with. And help students see the opportunity in that because if they engage with people who have those kinds of perspectives, they are going to be much stronger in the end than if they run away.\n\nM.J.: Do you see the situation differently for students at H.B.C.U.s? You mentioned that Dillard gave you the space to learn and build confidence before heading to graduate school.\n\nR.S.: There is a narrative that many people have for H.B.C.U.s. People see them as a monolith, or only see them as filling a gap that exists for African-Americans. H.B.C.U.s are not a brand. They are institutions with a certain history \u2014 they were originally set up basically to insure that there would be two separate systems for education \u2014 but they are not all alike, and are very diverse in what they offer.\n\nPrairie View, for example, is the second-oldest public institution of higher education in the state of Texas. It was set up basically to insure that there would be two separate systems for ex-slaves and whites. For a long time it provided educational opportunities for black students that wouldn\u2019t have been open to them otherwise. In nursing, architecture, engineering and other STEM fields at a time when many blacks were not able to go into those areas, the university was able to facilitate the entry of blacks into those professions.\n\nM.J.: Yes, this is something that Nikole Hannah-Jones has written about for The New York Times Magazine, in particular how Xavier University of Louisiana sends more black students to medical school than almost any other college in the country. I read that Prairie View has many more students who graduate with degrees in architecture and engineering.\n\nR.S.: Yes, going to Dillard is not like going to Prairie View. So the student who chooses to go to one H.B.C.U. may not find another appealing. That has to do with the unique features of the place, the academic culture and so on, the traditions. All of that makes a big difference.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen I went off to college, I was just trying to find a place where I could be a student without impediments that in that day and time were fairly widely known to be substantial if you enrolled in a majority-white institution. There was no question that in 1963, if you went off to college in the South, you had to be very careful about where you studied. The racial dynamic was very challenging at that time. One of the things I\u2019m learning now is that many of the students I speak to at Prairie View today have the same kinds of thoughts that I had those many years ago. They ask themselves, where can I feel comfortable so that I don\u2019t have to worry about anything but my academic work? So certainly that plays a factor in why students apply to H.B.C.U.s. And for some H.B.C.U.s, applications are way up. But if you reach the point where you think that a category of institutions are the right choice for you \u2014 going to an H.B.C.U. just to go to an H.B.C.U. \u2014 then you\u2019re not thinking broadly enough.\n\nM.J.: As you look across the landscape of higher education, what other challenges do college students face today?\n\nR.S.: I guess I worry a lot about our students having the skills and the experience to promote respectful interactions with a wide-ranging group of people. Students can be quite passionate about what they see on the national scene and how sometimes dangerous they think it is \u2014 how unpleasant it is and so forth. But we\u2019ve got to try to find a way on our campuses not to taint the national picture as hopeless, or as being antithetical to anything that we can think of as good and admirable. The last thing we want is for our students to bow out and decide that it isn\u2019t worth trying to do anything about a hopeless situation.\n\nAnd I do think that civility goes hand in hand with being hopeful. Hopeful that the next person you meet you will be able to converse with you in a respectful way. Hopeful that the next election cycle is going to give you a chance to be engaged and able to do something that makes you feel a sense of your own agency. Hopeful that the things will get better rather than worse.\n\nSo much of what we have to do on our campuses is really to hold open the possibility for people that civil society will in the end right itself \u2014 if enough of us are engaged. I am so thankful every day for the fact that I grew up in a time when nobody thought blacks would be able to be integrated into American society, they would never be able to hold important positions, they\u2019d never be respected intellectually, they\u2019d never be able to do the things that they are now able to do. So why did we persist? And why did we continue to work toward betterment? We did it because we had people working with us in education who were ever hopeful that things were going to change. So I like to say to educators, you have to be always projecting to students that civility enables hopefulness to be ever resurgent.", "keywords": ["today", "simmons", "think", "able", "students", "cultivating", "generation", "leadership", "view", "say", "things", "prairie", "dont", "ruth", "college"], "polarity": 0.18839701321015756, "subjectivity": 0.47766767453623127},

They are quiet, almost too much so. But once you learn what happened in these scenes from small towns, big cities or verdant fields, their almost unemotional first impression gives way to horror: Someone was lynched there.\n\nStarting in 2016, Mr. Clasper traveled through the United States seeking the sites of lynchings. He wanted to show how places that call no attention to themselves were the sites of hangings, slashings or execution by gunfire. In the course of covering 24 sites, they span 150 years, right up to the present century, and range from the American south to New York City.\n\n\u201cFrom my perspective, I take it back to 1903, when the American scholar and activist W.E.B. Du Bois said the problem of the 20th century is the problem of the color line,\u201d Mr. Clasper said. \u201cIt seems to me not a lot has changed despite significant advances. There has been barely a year or generation that has passed where racism and violence have not been at the forefront of the American experience.\u201d\n\nAs the London-born son of a British mother and American father, Mr. Clasper said he had \u201ca deep spiritual connection to the American landscape.\u201d In this series \u2014 titled \u201cThe Spaces We Inherit\u201d \u2014 he hopes to gently confront viewers in a way that eschews graphic images of violence.\n\n\u201cI took a different approach and focused on the spaces to encourage people to look at this history from an altered perspective,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve become desensitized to images of violence. But everything that happen s has to happen somewhere.\u201d\n\nGiven the persisting tensions over racial and religious prejudice, Mr. Clasper wants to gently provoke a necessary conversation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to investigate these deep-seated issues in America,\u201d he said. \u201cI think many agree that the nation has not dealt with its bloody past of lynchings and segregation. It seemed to me there has been no collective acceptance, let alone recognition of the mistakes made and the sins committed.\u201d\n\nInterviews were conducted by Oliver Clasper and have been edited for brevity.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Jesse Lee Bond, Arlington, Tenn., 1939\n\nOn April 28, 1939, a local sharecropper named Jesse Lee Bond was shot to death in broad daylight by employees of SY Wilson, a local hardware store. Jesse Lee Bond had asked for an invoice the day before after purchasing goods on credit, something that was no\u0095t done by African-Americans at that time as keeping sharecroppers in the dark about how much they had spent was one way for white owners to keep their workers in constant debt. The day of Jesse Lee Bond\u2019s murder he was ordered back to the store. His aunt accompanied him and witnessed the whole thing. \u201cThey shot at him and shot him. He ran out to the outhouse. They riddled the outhouse. And when he staggered out of the outhouse, they threw him down, castrated him, and dragged him to the river,\u0095\u201d she said. The family was told he had drowned accidentally.\n\nImage\n\nSylvester Lewis, Memphis\n\n\u201cI remember my cousin Jesse well. I was 9 when he was killed and he was 20. What I heard was that there had been a dispute at the SY Wilson general store over in Arlington. Jesse insisted on a receipt, but this is something they didn\u2019\u0095t do. I think whoever he was negotiating with relented, but I think the people over him, the father of the individual in question, didn\u2019\u0095t like it. They went to his home and said they wanted to talk to him and ordered him back to the store. When he returned they attacked him. He tried to run for his life but they caught up with him and shot him. I also heard that they dragged his body behind a vehicle and then dumped him in the river. The descendants are running the store now, and I\u2019\u0095m not sure they know what happened. The ones who were allegedly involved in the lynching passed a long time ago, but their relations are still in Arlington. I don\u2019t think there\u2019\u0095s any resentment now. Anyone who hears about it can\u2019\u0095t understand how that could happen. They simply can\u2019t relate to that kind of criminal activity.\u201d\n\nInterviewed November 2016.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Emmett Till, Drew, Miss., 1955.\n\nIn what is one of the most significant race-related events in the history of the United States, Emmett Till, a 14-year-old Chicago native, was brutally lynched in rural Mississippi on Aug. 28, 1955. Till, who had been visiting family members in the area, entered a local white-owned grocery store in the town of Money for less than one minute. Whatever was said between him and the proprietor, Carolyn Bryant, was used as the pretext for his murder. Four days later Till was abducted from his uncle\u2019\u0095s house by Roy Bryant, Carolyn\u2019\u0095s husband, and J.W. Milam and driven to a nearby barn where he was severely beaten and tortured (the original wall of the barn can be seen on the left of the photograph). He was then taken to the Tallahatchie River, shot in the head, and drowned with a cotton gin fan tied around his neck. In an infamous court case both defendants were found \u0094not guilty\u0095 by an all-white jury. Months later they sold their story and admitted their guilt, with Bryant claiming that the Supreme Court decision Brown v. Board of Education that desegregated schools was a mistake. Emmett Till\u2019s mother, Mamie Till Bradley, allowed photos to be taken of her son\u2019s broken and swollen body because she \u201cwanted the world to see what they did to my baby.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nDr. Jeffrey Andrews, Drew, Miss.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know the history of the property when I purchased it in 2003 and it was only two years later that a few local people told me of the Emmett Till murder. I\u2019ve lived in Drew since I was 12 and I had never heard of it. I\u2019ve since modified the barn to make it more functional and useful, and someone once asked me why I would change a historical site, but history is in the past and people should move on. Things have changed drastically here in the Mississippi Delta region and race relations are at all-time high. History is an important learning tool and it should be used to help people move forward, but one thing you have to remember is that people here don\u2019t want to be constantly reminded of how things were 60 years ago. We\u2019ve all moved forward, and sometimes people aren\u2019t given enough credit for the changes we\u2019ve made. I respect everyone\u2019s feelings towards Emmett Till, and I\u2019ve met some of his family members. They\u2019re great people. This has been a learning experience for my family and we appreciate the fact that we\u2019re part of a historical site.\u201d\n\nInterviewed March 2017.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Joe Coe, Omaha, 1891\n\nOn Oct. 10, 1891, a 50-year-old African-American named Joe Coe (also known as George Smith) was accused of sexually assaulting a 5-year-old girl and was quickly arrested. Rumors spread that the girl had died and that Coe would get off lightly, neither of which was true. A frenzied mob seized him from the jail at the Douglas County Courthouse, put a rope around his neck, and dragged his body through the streets. Coe was then hanged from a streetcar wire on the corner of 17th and Harney in front of thousands of onlookers. Souvenirs of the rope were later sold. Mayor Richard C. Cushing of Omaha condemned the lynching as \u201c\u0094the most deplorable thing that has ever happened in the history of the country.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Ell Persons, Memphis, 1917\n\nWhen the decapitated body of a 16-year-old local, Antoinette Rappel, was found near the old Wolf River Bridge in May 1917, Ell Persons, a local black woodcutter, was deemed a possible suspect. Despite being arrested and released twice, he was captured a third time and forced to confess. A local mob announced that he was to be lynched the next day. The news spread, and a crowd of 3,000 turned up to witness his lynching (including students of Central High School). Ell Persons was burned on a makeshift pyre in a carnival-like atmosphere. He was then decapitated, and his head was taken to the predominantly African-American Beale Street and thrown at locals. A century later his lynching was commemorated and a historic marker was erected near the site.\n\nImage\n\nAmal Altareb, Memphis\n\n\u201cI came to America in 2012 from Yemen. I\u2019m still learning the language and the history, and it wasn\u2019t until the spring of last year that I learned about lynchings. I knew some of the history of segregation and Jim Crow laws, and I knew how unfair the system was \u2014 that African-Americans weren\u2019t treated as equals \u2014 but I didn\u2019t know that human beings had been burned or hanged from a tree just because of their race. Last year my class at Central High School were discussing it and I asked what lynchings were and they were surprised that I didn\u2019t know. It\u2019s surprising that humans can go so far as to kill someone else in this way and create a festival-like atmosphere. There were even spectators. Uncovering the truth is painful, but it\u2019s important. The African-American students especially don\u2019t talk about it because it\u2019s painful, and it reminds them of the injustices towards their race. White Americans don\u2019t want to remember either because of the guilt they feel. I can understand why people want to avoid the topic, but we need to face history in order to move forward.\u201d\n\nInterviewed October 2016.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Leo Frank, Marietta, Ga., 1915\n\nMary Phagan, 13, was found dead on April 26, 1913, at a National Pencil Company factory where she worked. Amid an atmosphere of anti-Semitism and despite conflicting evidence, a Jewish superintendent named Leo Frank was convicted of the crime. Frank\u2019s sentence was later commuted from the death penalty to life imprisonment, a decision that led a mob on Aug. 17, 1915, to seize him from state prison and lynch him from a tree in Marietta, Mary Phagan\u2019s hometown. Later that year the second chapter of the Ku Klux Klan was founded on Stone Mountain, with a number of Leo Frank\u2019s murderers present. Leo Frank was posthumously pardoned in 1986.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of George W. Murray, Mae Murray Dorsey, Roger Malcom and Dorothy Malcolm, Walton County, Georgia, 1946\n\nAfter Roger Malcom, a World War II veteran and Georgia sharecropper, had been bailed out of jail after allegedly stabbing a white man, members of the local community decided to take revenge. On July 25, 1946, a mob of 15 to 20 stopped the car Malcom was riding in with his wife, Dorothy, and another couple, George W. Murray and Mae Murray Dorsey, who was pregnant. They tied the four of them to a nearby tree and shot them to death. Mae Murray Dorsey then had her unborn baby ripped out of her. Despite an F.B.I. investigation nobody was brought to trial for the crime, and a few months later a grand jury was \u201cunable to establish the identity of any persons guilty of violating the civil rights statute of the United States.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nCeleste Butler, Omaha\n\n\u201cTracing one\u2019s roots and one\u2019s history is hard, especially as an African-American. These are big questions we all want to know: Who are we and where do we come from? I had DNA testing done recently but it didn\u2019t lead anywhere. It just told me that my ancestors came from West Africa, but it couldn\u2019t say where exactly. Missing that part and not being able to hand it down to my children or grandchildren is frustrating. On top of that you hear some people in this country telling black people to \u2018go back home.\u2019 Home to what? Home to whom? It feels like a total assault both mentally and physically to have chapters and generations missing. Not being able to fill that void is difficult. When it comes to racial violence I feel like we\u2019re constantly suffering from PTSD. It\u2019s a stress that never really goes away. A lot of people suffer in pain and in silence, and they suffer for successive generations. Everything was stripped from us, and we\u2019ve been struggling to put the pieces back together ever since.\u201d\n\nInterviewed September 2017.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Michael Donald, Mobile, Ala., 1981\n\nMichael Donald, 19, was abducted on March 21, 1981, by Henry Hays and James Knowles as he was walking home. They beat him, slit his throat, and hanged his body from a tree outside 114 Herndon Avenue. The pretext for Donald\u2019s murder was a \u201cnot guilty\u201d verdict handed down by a partially black jury to an African-American man accused of killing a white police officer. This incensed the Alabama chapter of the Ku Klux Klan, led by Benny Jack Hays, the father of Henry Hays, who suggested killing a random black person in response. Michael Donald\u2019s mother, Beulah Mae Donald, with the help of the Southern Poverty Law Center, brought a case not just against the killers but also the United Klans of America. Beulah Mae Donald won the case and received $7 million in damages, essentially bankrupting the U.K.A. Henry Hays was executed, while Knowles received life imprisonment. Hays is the only known Klan member to have been executed in the 20th century for the murder of an African-American. Herndon Avenue has since been renamed Michael Donald Avenue and a historic marker has been erected.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Mulugeta Seraw, Portland, Ore., 1988\n\nOn the evening of Nov. 13, 1988, an Ethiopian student named Mulugeta Seraw was being dropped off at his apartment when he was attacked by Kenneth Mieske, Kyle Brewster and Steve Strasser, members of a local racist skinhead group called East Side White Pride. Mieske delivered the fatal blows with a baseball bat. He was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. In 1990 Seraw\u2019s family, represented by the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League, brought a civil lawsuit against the killers\u2019 affiliated group, the White Aryan Nation, and its leaders, Tom and John Metzger, for $12.5 million. Tom Metzger later said that the killers had done their \u201ccivic duty\u201d by killing Seraw.\n\nImage\n\nJason Downard, Portland, Ore.\n\n\u201cWhen I was 2 I was put into foster care, and in 2009 I went to prison for a gang-affiliated drive-by shooting. I didn\u2019t grow up racist, but in prison the racist skinheads pulled me into their group and drilled stuff into my head about how the media is run by Jews and that they wanted an all-white nation. I also got a tattoo of a swastika on my leg, which I\u2019ve since had covered up. It\u2019s a painful reminder. The skinheads showed me support and love and compassion, which I hadn\u2019t experienced before in my life; everyone is looking for some kind of acceptance. I was angry and uncomfortable with who I was, and I drove that anger towards people who didn\u2019t look like me. In the last two years of the movement my sister had a son with a black guy and my nephew would give me this look like he knew what I was about. I started to get a guilty conscience and began to think about the things I thought I believed in. My sister said I\u2019d been brainwashed, and I can see why. The movement just taught me to hate and reinforced those views. The problem of racism in this country is much deeper than many people think. When it comes to Trump, he\u2019s tacitly endorsed the alt-right and white supremacists. It\u2019s been a ripple effect and things have gotten worse since he came into power. The right now feel emboldened. I look back now at some of the things I\u2019ve done and I realize that I\u2019ve hurt a lot of people. I decided I wanted to help others who had been in a similar position to me, and that\u2019s been my mission ever since. Now I work for an organization called Life After Hate. I\u2019m a marked man, and maybe I\u2019ll die doing this, but at least I\u2019ll die knowing I did the right thing.\u201d\n\nInterviewed October 2017.\n\nImage\n\nThe Murder Site of Timothy Caughman, New York City, 2017\n\nOn March 17, 2017 James Harris Jackson traveled from his home in Baltimore to New York City with the intention of killing random black men. The reason, he later told police, was his hatred of interracial relationships. Three days later he found Timothy Caughman, 66, collecting cans in a trash bin on the corner of West 36th and 9th Avenue and stabbed him multiple times with an 18-inch sword. Caughman died of his injuries that night, and two days later Jackson turned himself in, telling police that he had planned to kill more black men in Times Square. On March 27, Jackson was charged with one count each of murder in the first and second degrees as an act of terrorism, second-degree murder as a hate crime, and three counts of criminal possession of a weapon.\n\n\u201cThe Spaces We Inherit,\u201d which will be published as a book by Overlapse in October 2018, is available for pre-order.\n\nFollow @nytimesphoto on Twitter.

You will recognize him because he\u2019ll be dressed exactly like Lionel Richie.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn a recent Thursday evening he was wearing an elegant black overcoat \u2014 his \u201cLondon coat,\u201d he said, as opposed to his \u201cL.A. coat,\u201d because by Los Angeles standards it was Londonishly cold out. Around his neck were two rings on a silver chain. A double-looped black scarf grazed his sternum like a lei. Every so often he paused to adjust the scarf ever so slightly, as if confirming that it was still there. Hello, scarf.\n\nAt 68, Mr. Richie is as busy as he\u2019s ever been. There is \u201cIdol,\u201d of course. Beginning this month, there is also a return to \u201cAll the Hits,\u201d the residency at Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas, a place where a proven draw like Lionel Richie could conceivably fiesta forever. There is the home-goods line, whose Instagram feed features many photos of Lionel Richie\u2019s bejeweled hands touching jacquard towels and fine bed linens. There are also grandchildren, to whom the pop icon is Pop-Pop.\n\n\u201cFor a Gemini who probably has about 15 to 20 minutes of attention span,\u201d Mr. Richie said, \u201cthis is pretty darn good.\u201d\n\nAlthough he has made cameo appearances on both \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d and \u201cCanadian Idol\u201d (as well as their crosstown rival, NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Voice\u201d), his decision to join the judges\u2019 panel full time is a surprise. Like many artists whose achievements predate it, Mr. Richie has criticized the show over the years for promoting cookie-cutter talent. In 2009 he suggested to Blues & Soul magazine that \u201cIdol\u201d would have quickly sent Mick Jagger and James Brown packing.\n\nWhen reminded of these comments, Mr. Richie smiled and lowered his head until it was almost touching the table, as if he\u2019d just been ambushed with a cringeworthy childhood photo.\n\n\u201cWas I a fan of these shows?\u201d he said. \u201cAbsolutely not. I was not.\u201d\n\nBut when he was asked to join the reboot \u2014 \u201cIdol\u201d is getting a fresh start on ABC after 15 seasons on Fox that ended in April 2016 \u2014 Mr. Richie said, he began thinking about how best to make use of the platform. For years, he said, he\u2019s watched an increasingly dysfunctional music business fail to mentor artists for the long haul.\n\n\u201cFor two days a week, Professor Richie is going to talk about the reality of what it takes to be an artist,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead of sitting here moaning about how the world has changed since I started, I\u2019m going to tell them what it takes. You think it\u2019s just singing? No, it\u2019s not. What kind of style do you have? What kind of stamina do you have? How many times can you take \u2018No\u2019? How many times can you come back? That\u2019s an artist.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d executive producer, Trish Kinane, who worked on the Fox version of the show from Season 12 to 15, as well, said Mr. Richie genuinely wanted to share his expertise. \u201cI think the viewers can really smell it when people are fake, because they\u2019ve seen these shows so often,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it excited him to think that he could be helping more than one person, through this process, change their lives.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Perry said she insisted Mr. Richie join the panel after running into him one night at the Sunset Tower and spending hours listening to him talk about his experiences in the music industry. \u201cIt was just jaw-dropping,\u201d she said. \u201cI went to the producers and I put my foot down. I was like, Lionel Richie is the uncle, historian, the wisdom that we are missing on this show.\u201d\n\nHe has \u201cbountiful grace,\u201d she added. \u201cWhen he speaks, the whole room listens. He takes his time, he has patience, he doesn\u2019t feel the need to prove. He is Lionel Richie.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nHAD \u201cIDOL\u201d EXISTED in the 1960s, when Mr. Richie was of auditioning age, he would have gone nowhere near it. As a young man, he was painfully shy. He likes to say he thanks God for the Commodores, because without them, he\u2019d never have discovered Lionel Richie.\n\nHe was born in Tuskegee, Ala., and grew up on the campus of Tuskegee University, a few doors down from the Oaks, Booker T. Washington\u2019s former home. He was a freshman economics major at Tuskegee when one of his future bandmates spotted him carrying a saxophone case and offered him a spot in the band that would become the Commodores.\n\nAt the time, Mr. Richie said, he\u2019d been contemplating dropping out of school to join the Episcopalian clergy. Then he did his first show with the band. The curtain rose, Mr. Richie heard the sound of young women screaming in delight, and there went his interest in the priesthood.\n\nAfter a nationwide tour opening for the Jackson 5, the Commodores signed to Motown, and Mr. Richie began to learn the lessons only experience can teach. Once, before a show, he decided to say hello to the members of Parliament-Funkadelic, whose dressing room was down the hall. \u201cThe door opens,\u201d Mr. Richie recalled, \u201cand that was when I realized, This is not Kansas, ladies and gentlemen.\u201d\n\nMr. Richie, who had been an Air Explorer Scout back in Tuskegee, spent about 30 minutes in P-Funk\u2019s lair that night. \u201cEverybody was talented, everybody could sing, and everybody\u2019s naked,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re like, \u2018This is the record business, man.\u2019 \u201d\n\nWith the Commodores, Mr. Richie co-wrote the deathless wedding-reception staple \u201cBrick House,\u201d but soon discovered he had a knack for ballads.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI\u2019m your James Taylor guy, you know?\u201d he said. \u201cI was your Carole King guy. I was your Marvin Gaye guy. Very sensitive. One of the things I heard growing up was, \u2018Mr. and Mrs. Richie, the problem with Lionel is he\u2019s too sensitive.\u2019 And of course, all that meant was that I was a songwriter. I was not a football player, and I was not going to be a hunter. I\u2019m the guy that shot a bird one time and cried over the bird for the next two days, you know? That\u2019s just who I am.\u201d\n\nTuskegee was a bubble of black achievement in the pre-civil rights South, and Mr. Richie said he grew up insulated from many of the cold facts of race in America, including the de facto segregation of pop and R&B on commercial radio. When he began coming into his own as a writer he was almost willfully ignorant of those categories. His hits for the Commodores could be sentimental, even saccharine, but were also sneakily genre-defying. \u201cSail On\u201d is a lonely-loadout lament fit for a mid-70s Jackson Browne album; the 1977 smash \u201cEasy\u201d was pure country.\n\nIn 1978, the Commodores released the Richie-penned \u201cThree Times a Lady\u201d and many black radio stations drew the line, refusing \u2014 at the height of funk and disco \u2014 to play a waltz. Mr. Richie and the Motown promotion executive Skip Miller summoned a group of unconvinced D.J.s and program directors from around the country \u2014 \u201cMy biggest haters,\u201d Mr. Richie said \u2014 for a sit down at a restaurant on Sunset Boulevard. There, with Kanye Westian bravado, the not-yet-30-year-old Mr. Richie announced his desire to be the greatest songwriter who\u2019d ever lived \u2014 as opposed to the greatest black songwriter \u2014 and then asked them personally to give his record a shot.\n\n\u201cBut you\u2019ve got to play it for a week or two, just to make sure,\u201d he told them. \u201cYou can\u2019t put it on at 11 o\u2019clock at night. Put it on in drive time. If it doesn\u2019t go, I\u2019ll never bother you again.\u201d\n\nIt went. Mr. Richie\u2019s reputation grew. In 1980, Kenny Rogers called to commission a ballad, and Richie wrote, arranged and produced \u201cLady,\u201d the first record of that decade to top three different Billboard charts.\n\nAt Motown\u2019s urging he recorded a solo album, then another. He still assumed he\u2019d retire as a Commodore. He said everything changed after the 1984 Olympics. During the closing ceremony, in front of a worldwide TV audience, Mr. Richie performed \u201cAll Night Long,\u201d dancing on a mechanical riser like a single man atop a wedding cake.\n\nAt first, this didn\u2019t feel like a turning point. \u201cI left the house,\u201d Mr. Richie said, \u201cwent and ran around this field for 20 minutes, got back in the car and left the stadium.\u201d\n\nThen he stopped at an intersection. \u201cI am three cars back from the red light,\u201d he said, \u201cand people are walking up to the car.\u201d He tapped the table urgently, imitating the manic energy of a swarm of excited fans. In that moment, he said, \u201cI became \u2018Lionel Richie All Night Long.\u2019 Lionel Richie All Night Long! Lionel Richie All Night Long! These people have just gotten off the plane from Taipei, but they know Lionel Richie All Night Long.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThis period blurs together when he talks about it now. It wasn\u2019t all one year, but it feels that way. The Oscar nomination for \u201cEndless Love.\u201d The Olympics. Leaving the Commodores. Sitting with Michael Jackson, writing the USA for Africa charity single \u201cWe Are the World,\u201d and meeting Jackson\u2019s albino python Muscles, who slipped into the studio unnoticed and greeted Richie with open jaws. (\u201cLionel, he wants to say hello to you,\u201d Mr. Richie recalled Jackson said. \u201cWhy are you screaming?\u201d)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor a natural workaholic the pace was addictive at first, but Mr. Richie said being a star on that level also brought with it \u201cunbelievable stress.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the astronaut,\u201d Mr. Richie said, \u201cand everything on planet Earth is falling apart.\u201d\n\nHe went home to Tuskegee to care for his dying father. Doctors found nodules on his vocal cords. His marriage grew strained, then imploded in tabloid-ugly fashion \u2014 in 1988, his first wife, Brenda, was arrested on an assault charge after catching Mr. Richie with another woman and kicking him in what newspapers referred to, perhaps politely, as the \u201cstomach area.\u201d\n\nBy the end of his most successful decade, Mr. Richie found himself at home in Tuskegee, living in his childhood bedroom. When he was at his lowest, a family friend dropped by, saying he\u2019d brought some inspirational music.\n\n\u201cAnd he brought my albums by,\u201d Mr. Richie said. \u201cHe\u2019d labeled which songs to listen to. He said, \u2018Be sure to listen to the lyrics.\u2019 He gave me my music back.\u201d\n\nSo Mr. Richie sat in his old bedroom, where he\u2019d spent many nights grooving to Jimi Hendrix\u2019s \u201cBand of Gypsys\u201d under black light, and listened to his own songs, the ones that had touched so many and brought them so much joy, so much comfort. He sat and cried and found the strength to go on.\n\nHe owns that house now, along with much of the land around it. Someday he wants to turn that land into a beautiful garden. And in that garden he intends to build another little house, where he\u2019ll keep all his memorabilia and awards. A kind of Lionel Richie museum, which visitors to Tuskegee might add to their itineraries along with Booker T. Washington\u2019s house and the field where the Tuskegee Airmen learned to fly.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt may go without saying that the house he means to build in that garden in Tuskegee will be a brick house, but Lionel Richie says it anyway.\n\nPhoto\n\nMR. RICHIE MAY BE the only pop star who has counted both Nelson Mandela and Muammar el-Qaddafi among his die-hard fans. Of course, both of them are gone now. So, too, are many of the artists Mr. Richie thought of as his contemporaries, including Jackson, Prince and Whitney Houston. In the time that Mr. Richie has been a public figure \u2014 and a parent to children who are also navigating public lives \u2014 the very nature of celebrity has been transformed by social media.\n\nMr. Richie\u2019s youngest daughter, Sofia, has been romantically linked to Scott Disick, the estranged partner of Kourtney Kardashian. Over dessert, Mr. Richie considered how the hubbub around this liaison compares to the early 2000s, when his daughter, Nicole, had her own moment of infamy while joined at the hip to Paris Hilton.\n\nMr. Richie said there\u2019s no comparison. \u201cI\u2019m a veteran now,\u201d he said, \u201cbut Nicole was the Gulf War. Nicole and Paris were Vietnam for me. Because I had no experience. What\u2019s happening now with Sofie is leaps and bounds easier, because I know how to approach it. With Nicole, it was like being shot in the head every morning. Did she get arrested? For what? We didn\u2019t know what was coming next.\u201d\n\nHe laughed. To hear Mr. Richie describe it, fatherhood is a job not unlike being the elder-statesman judge on \u201cAmerican Idol.\u201d You\u2019re there to provide an example of constancy in an ever-changing world. The fact of your presence serves as a lesson unto itself.\n\n\u201cThere are moments where life should have scared me,\u201d Mr. Richie said, \u201cbut it didn\u2019t. Why? Because I was 19 and my parents were the mountain. And I get it now. You know, one day I pulled out of that driveway with the Commodores, in a van with five guys with Afros the size of Kentucky. There was no Instagram, no nothing. They didn\u2019t know where we were until I called them again. I\u2019m sure it was not what they wanted. But I give them all the props in the world, because they faked it very well.\u201d", "keywords": ["know", "mr", "idol", "lionel", "american", "tuskegee", "commodores", "hed", "richie", "teach", "wants", "house", "real", "night"], "polarity": 0.1844574979114453, "subjectivity": 0.4648626775271511},

Though his inquiry is intensely, at times painfully personal, Mr. Wilkerson is above all concerned with unpacking the mechanisms of racial domination. The procedure is akin to performing surgery on a half-conscious subject, or digging up a buried land mine that has lost little of its explosive power.\n\nVideo\n\nThe focus of his excavation is a killing that took place in Dothan, Ala., in 1946, when S.E. Branch, a white shopkeeper, shot Bill Spann, a black man who was in his store. Branch, Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s great-grandfather, was charged with first-degree murder, but no trial was ever held, and the crime faded from memory. Or rather, the memory of it was quietly and systematically suppressed. All that remains are a short newspaper article and a few photographs and home movies of the killer.\n\n\u201cDid You Wonder Who Fired the Gun?\u201d proceeds on several parallel tracks. Mr. Wilkerson returns to Alabama and tries to discover both how Bill Spann died and how he was forgotten. His investigation, accompanied by haunting images of Southern back roads and quiet houses, is punctuated by reminders that Bill Spann\u2019s death is hardly a unique or anomalous event. The names of Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner and other recent victims of racist violence appear onscreen, and two songs of protest loop into the soundtrack: Janelle Mon\u00e1e\u2019s \u201cHell You Talmbout\u201d and Phil Ochs\u2019s \u201cWilliam Moore.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat song, about a white postal worker and civil rights activist murdered on an Alabama highway in 1963, is the source of the film\u2019s title and a part of its wider cultural context. \u201cDid You Wonder Who Fired the Gun?\u201d is a passionately political film, aflame with rage in spite of its director\u2019s measured, ruminative tone of voice. It is also a horror movie, full of specters and silences and a terror that is pervasive, intimate and elusive.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Wilkerson, whose previous films include \u201cAn Injury to One\u201d and \u201cFar From Afghanistan,\u201d dispenses with many of the usual techniques of historical documentary. There are a few on-camera interviews, with neighbors and relatives, but more frequently Mr. Wilkerson narrates encounters that took place off camera. And his sleuthing often leads not to moments of revelation but to dead ends and deeper mysteries. The insertion of clips from \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d provides a chilling and ironic counterpoint to the grim story this movie is telling. S.E. Branch is the opposite of Gregory Peck\u2019s brave and decent Atticus Finch, and the truth about what happened to Bill Spann resists the kind of redemptive, healing conclusion that remains a cornerstone of American racial fantasy.\n\nInstead of consolation, Mr. Wilkerson offers commitment. Instead of idealism, honesty. He doesn\u2019t suppose that his film will solve anything, but there is nonetheless something profoundly useful about the way he confronts past and present manifestations of white supremacy. He links his great-grandfather\u2019s crime to the contemporaneous gang rape of Recy Taylor (the subject of an excellent recent documentary by Nancy Buirski), and uncovers patterns of abuse within his family. He corresponds with a relative who is part of a white nationalist, \u201cSouthern secessionist\u201d group. He notes the way racial injustice dwells in apparently mundane facts. The killer is immortalized in pictures and a well-kept tombstone. His victim has been almost entirely erased from memory, a kind of second death beyond the reach of redress or revenge.", "keywords": ["white", "bill", "mr", "movie", "gun", "supremacy", "fired", "memory", "wonder", "spann", "racial", "wilkerson", "reckons", "review"], "polarity": 0.04540441176470589, "subjectivity": 0.3202205882352941},

LaGuardia High School, another specialized school, admits students by audition and a review of academic records. The schools have long been criticized for not being representative of the overall population of the city\u2019s school system, which is 67 percent black and Latino.\n\nIn his first mayoral campaign, Mr. de Blasio pledged to overhaul the schools\u2019 admissions process, moving to a system that took into account multiple criteria. But, since being elected, he has not made any significant effort to do that. (Changing the admissions process for the three original schools, Stuyvesant High School, the Bronx High School of Science and Brooklyn Tech, would require state legislation, which he has not pushed for.)\n\nInstead, the city has taken more modest steps, including expanding a free after-school test-preparation program and offering the admissions test during the school day at some middle schools that historically have not sent many students to the specialized schools. In the fall, the city revamped the exam, scrapping a section in which students had to take paragraphs with sentences that had been scrambled and reassemble them. The education department said the changes would make the test more equitable by better reflecting what students actually learn in school.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

I can relate to self-loathing. The reason a person lashes out the way Dixon does is because he hates himself, so anybody can relate to that. I\u2019m drawn to complex characters; they\u2019re all filled with so many different feelings, and that\u2019s what makes them interesting.

That\u2019s what\u2019s interesting.\n\nWhat do you think it was about this role, and this film, that led to so many awards?\n\nIt\u2019s the transformational aspect of it, the fact that he was really many different roles wrapped up in one role. He\u2019s a doofus, he\u2019s a racist, he\u2019s violent, he\u2019s a mama\u2019s boy. There\u2019s a few heroic things at certain points. But he\u2019s very flawed, and it\u2019s a boy-to-man journey.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThere\u2019s been criticism that your character got away scot-free for his racist behavior and for throwing a guy out the window, and never being brought to justice.\n\nIt\u2019s a small town and, who knows, in real life maybe he would have gotten thrown in prison. It\u2019s a sort of dark fairy tale in certain ways \u2014 it\u2019s not necessarily meant to be completely realistic. And if it is meant to be realistic, in real life, things aren\u2019t tied up in a bow. People who deserve to get punished don\u2019t necessarily get punished.\n\nDid it surprise you that there was criticism of the movie along these lines?\n\nNo, whenever a movie is popular and it is a complex dramatic story, I think it\u2019s going to stir up a lot of feelings. A lot of good stuff come out of it \u2014 the billboards that have been popping up [activists recreated versions of the billboards in Miami and London]. That\u2019s kind of incredible, when a movie can effect social change, that\u2019s kind of astounding. I think Mildred [the film\u2019s mother, played by Frances McDormand, who is seeking justice in the murder of her daughter] is a really beautiful working-class wonder woman in some ways. It\u2019s a kind of antihero slash protagonist thing that I think women really need right now. Mildred and [the directors] Greta Gerwig and Patty Jenkins.

Is it self-taught?\n\nIt\u2019s a long story, but I hung out with a certain crowd, and it was a way to meet girls.\n\nWhat kind of certain crowd?\n\nSan Francisco is not all cable cars and Rice-A-Roni. There were some tough kids there. When I was in middle school, there was a more white supremacist kind of group I didn\u2019t get along with. I got in a lot of fights with them and didn\u2019t win a lot of those fights. I didn\u2019t get along with the rich kids, people we called WPODs: white punks on dope. My school was interracial, and I met a cool group of friends who introduced me to some other friends. I used to do really bad break dancing, when \u201cThriller\u201d and \u201cPurple Rain\u201d came out. I was into Run-DMC, Grandmaster Flash, Doug E. Fresh, Eric B. & Rakim. Probably my biggest inspiration was James Brown, and watching Tom Cruise in \u201cRisky Business.\u201d I remember practicing that, and watching James Brown do the splits. I [recently] did SoulCycle, I\u2019m not proud to say, and Usher was next to me. I thought I had rhythm until I was on a bicycle next to Usher. This is what happens when you go to spinning class in Hollywood.\n\nWere you intimidated working with Frances McDormand?\n\nI think it\u2019s the biggest compliment to Frances that people are asking, \u201cWere you intimidated by her?\u201d Not really, but I was nervous to get in the ring with a great actor. I\u2019ve worked with a lot of great actors. She\u2019s really a force. I think what\u2019s great about her is her integrity. Her sense of truth is like an iron bar. All these people \u2014 Woody [Harrelson, a co-star], Martin [McDonagh, the film\u2019s writer-director], Frances \u2014 are true anarchists, they really are. I think it comes through in their work.

There is no nullification, there is no secession. Federal law is the supreme law of the land,\u201d said Mr. Sessions, one of the administration\u2019s most adamant immigration restrictionists. He accused the state of intentionally using \u201cevery power the legislature has to undermine the duly established immigration laws of America.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit, which the Justice Department disclosed on Tuesday in advance of Mr. Sessions\u2019s speech, capped a clash between the Trump administration and California that has lasted more than a year, with each side reaping political profit from the battle. The administration has sought to demonstrate that it will not tolerate noncompliance with federal immigration enforcement; California\u2019s top officials, professed leaders of the anti-Trump resistance, have pushed the state to cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement as little as possible.\n\nPhoto\n\nEven as Mr. Sessions spoke, that opposition was making itself heard. Outside the hotel where Mr. Sessions was speaking, several hundred protesters marched, holding signs saying \u201cGo Home Jeff\u201d and \u201cCrush ICE\u201d and chanting, \u201cWhat do we want? Sessions out!\u201d\n\nShortly after Mr. Sessions\u2019s speech, Mr. Brown and the state\u2019s attorney general, Xavier Becerra, both Democrats, appeared together in the Capitol to denounce the lawsuit.\n\n\u201cCalifornia is in the business of public safety,\u201d Mr. Becerra said. \u201cWe are not in the business of deportation.\u201d\n\nThe suit, filed on Tuesday evening in Federal District Court in Sacramento, is the first Mr. Sessions\u2019s Justice Department has filed against a local or state government over its immigration policies.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt targets three state laws passed in recent months: one that limits state and local agencies\u2019 ability to share information about criminals or suspects with federal immigration officers, unless they have been convicted of serious crimes; a second that prohibits local businesses from allowing ICE to examine employee records without a court order or a subpoena; and a third that gave California officials more oversight over the state\u2019s immigration detention centers.\n\nMr. Brown and Mr. Becerra defended the legislation as constitutional on Wednesday, saying that the laws prevented neither ICE agents from working in local jails and prisons nor employers from cooperating with ICE. The employee records law, Mr. Becerra said, simply ensures that workers and employers are guaranteed \u201ctheir rights and their privacy and that those are being respected.\u201d\n\nAsked whether the law would, in effect, require warning undocumented workers to flee ahead of an ICE visit, Mr. Brown compared the provision to the practice of notifying criminal suspects that they have a right to a lawyer. \u201cWe are just following the law, and the law allows people to be advised of their rights,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cAnything else smacks of a more totalitarian approach to things.\u201d\n\nMr. Sessions had another comparison in mind.\n\nWhat if, he asked, a state enacted legislation hampering the work of employees from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration or the Environmental Protection Agency? \u201cWould you pass a law to do that?\u201d he said.\n\nBeyond the specifics of the laws, Mr. Sessions railed about several instances in which he said state officials had frustrated the work of federal law enforcement. He heartily ripped into Libby Schaaf, the Democratic mayor of Oakland, for issuing a warning last week that ICE planned to arrest immigrants across Northern California, an alert that infuriated agency officials who said her tip-off had allowed hundreds of their targets to slip away.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

But there are many other officials across the country who say they would prefer to work with ICE if the legal issues surrounding such cooperation are clarified, and some who are eager to help the federal government outright with immigration enforcement.\n\nThose tensions were palpable at Mr. Sessions\u2019s speech, which was hosted by the California Peace Officers Association, a law enforcement advocacy group. The crowd responded to the speech with brief applause; about 10 of the more than 200 officers in the room stood to clap.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m stuck in the middle,\u201d said Deputy Chief Derek Williams of the police department in Ontario, a midsize city east of Los Angeles with a large Hispanic population. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely bifurcated now.\u201d\n\nWhile the new state laws do not affect his work on a day-to-day basis, he said, the sharp increase in ICE activity has fostered \u201ca lack of trust with law enforcement\u201d among immigrant residents. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult time for us,\u201d he said.\n\nAmong those who endorsed Mr. Sessions\u2019s message was Paul R. Curry, a lobbyist for the California Correctional Supervisors Organization, which represents supervisors in the state prison system. He said California police chiefs were often caught between ICE\u2019s requests and the orders of their mayors, who might embrace sanctuary policies.\n\n\u201cEvery police officer is sworn to uphold the law not only of the state but the nation,\u201d Mr. Curry said. \u201cThe progressive agenda is running afoul of the force of our laws in the country.\u201d", "keywords": ["scolds", "jeff", "speech", "mr", "state", "laws", "ice", "enforcement", "sessions", "federal", "immigration", "law", "california", "problem"], "polarity": 0.0743163526614231, "subjectivity": 0.3816108773855252},

While it may not be a common vantage point, the narrative is a natural one for Marilyn Stern, a photographer and graphic artist who is a member of the Metropolitan Postcard Club of New York City.\n\nNot surprisingly, the vast majority of postcards that feature black people in the United States from the 19th and 20th centuries were very racist, she said.\n\n\u201cI was so sick of seeing these horrible racist stereotypes,\u201d said Ms. Stern, a collector since the mid-1970s. \u201cWhenever I came across something that was not racist or not stereotypical, or even went so far as showing romance between the races, I wanted to save it and collect it.\u201d\n\nHer collection, which numbers about 3,000, has about 300 postcards that depict African-American life in all lights.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard for us to fathom how isolated people were, especially in rural areas and isolated small towns before there were telephones and radios,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were postal deliveries three times a day, so it was the internet of the early 1900s.\u201d\n\nPostcards had better printing technology than magazines and newspapers did at the time, as the burst of color in the selection below shows. They could show racism with clarity. \u201cThe idea that you could see images so realistic blew people away,\u201d she said.\n\nMany of the racist postcards were a form of propaganda, she said.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important to see how racism was manifested in the past,\u201d she said, \u201cperhaps to better fight it in the present. You can recognize something if you\u2019ve seen it before.\u201d\n\nBelow is a selection from Ms. Stern\u2019s collection with descriptions based on her research.\n\nTrade Cards\n\nImage\n\nAfrican-Americans were often subjects \u2014 and targets \u2014 of advertising cards that were issued before 1900. These cards were frequently given away in products, or with the purchase of a product.\n\nAbove, an advertisement for J & P Coats thread. Below, a country doctor dispensing Ayer\u2019s Cathartic Pills.\n\nImage\n\nThe Cakewalk\n\nImage\n\nThe Cakewalk, a dance created by plantation slaves as a satire of Southern white society, was the focus of these cards, which featured two black children and an African-American troupe that toured Europe in the late 1800s and early 1900s.\n\nRacist Cards\n\nImage\n\nThe card on the left was shot in a professional studio, but it was labeled \u201cHer Country Cousins.\u201d The implication was that no matter how refined, educated or successful black Americans became, they were still basically savages, Ms. Stern said.\n\nThe two cards on the right were produced in 1905 in New York on the common theme of the delivery stork. The first one, with the caption \u201cComparing Notes,\u201d shows both a black baby and a white baby, with no apparent bias. The second one shows two black babies with the slogan \u201cNo Race Suicide,\u201d implying that a high black birthrate threatened white supremacy, she said.\n\n\u201cLovers of All Nations\u201d\n\nImage\n\nThis postcard was from a series mailed in 1908 that was called \u201cLovers of All Nations.\u201d The banjo was a racial stereotype, but the card is in the non-discriminating \u201cFamily of Man\u201d tradition.\n\nMemories of Slavery\n\nImage\n\nPostcards once served as documentary photography. Some cards honored older African-Americans of the South, who were living memories of slavery. This was part of a series, and it was mailed in 1906.\n\nLife in the Jim Crow South\n\nImage\n\nA fortuneteller with white clients, mailed in 1908.\n\nHoliday Greetings\n\nImage\n\nIdealized country life, in a card mailed in 1907, as Americans flocked to cities.\n\nReligion\n\nImage\n\nA card, likely from the early 1950s, urging parishioners to come to church.\n\nReal Photos\n\nImage\n\nAn unidentified young woman in her graduation cap and gown, in a studio portrait taken between the 1920s and \u201940s. Cards labeled \u201cReal Photo Postcards\u201d are set apart from commercially printed postcards and are actual photographs printed on photographic paper with a preprinted postcard back.\n\nAchievement\n\nImage\n\nThe many important contributions that African-Americans made to society were rarely acknowledged in older postcards, but an exception was made for the scientist and educator George Washington Carver.\n\nHis experiments with peanuts, sweet potatoes and other crops contributed greatly to the economy of the South. This card \u2014 from a photo shot on Kodachrome or Ektachrome film \u2014 is from the late 1950s to mid-60s.\n\nFor more, see Ms. Stern\u2019s postcard blog, and a review of the film Through a Lens Darkly that deals with African-American representation in postcards and photography.

It is the first $100 million movie directed by an African-American woman, and the diversity of its cast is both a welcome innovation and the declaration of a new norm.

In issues of \u201cJungle Action,\u201d though, Mr. McGregor and the artist Rich Buckler began to expand the mythos of the Black Panther\u2019s homeland, Wakanda, and created the character of Erik Killmonger.

This architect, urban planner and educator talks about how his buildings aim to foster a sense of community, how space can promote inner peace, how cities can contribute to the health of a society.\n\nConsidered a pioneer of low-cost housing, Mr. Doshi, 90, is thrilled to have been awarded the 2018 Pritzker Prize, architecture\u2019s highest honor, which was announced on Wednesday. He is the first laureate from India, and worked with the 20th-century masters Le Corbusier and Louis Kahn.\n\n\u201cIt is a very wonderful thing that happened,\u201d he said in a recent telephone interview from his home in Ahmedabad, a city that was once the center of the nonviolent struggle for Indian independence. The award will be bestowed on Mr. Doshi, the 45th laureate, at the Aga Khan Museum in Toronto in May.\n\nBut Mr. Doshi\u2019s 70-year career has always been about much more than prizes \u2014 of which he nevertheless has many \u2014 or international renown, of which he had relatively little, given that he is not a household name.\n\nImage Rendering of Aranya, a low-cost housing complex of houses, courtyards and pathways that aims to empower \u201cthe have-nots to realize their dreams through ownership,\u201d Mr. Doshi said, \u201cimproving their quality of personal and community life.\u201d Credit VSF\n\nMr. Doshi has been consumed with larger issues like social good and sustainability. And he bemoans a culture and profession that he sees as overly concerned with the bottom line. \u201cOne is all the time looking at financial returns \u2014 that is not only what life is,\u201d he said. \u201cI think wellness is missing.\u201d\n\nWhat Mr. Doshi means by \u201cwellness,\u201d he said, are considerations like how we can \u201cconnect with silence\u201d; how \u201clife can be lived at your own pace\u201d; and \u201chow do we avoid the use of an automobile.\u201d\n\nThe architect has brought this type of philosophical thinking to projects like his Aranya Low Cost Housing in Indore (1989), where more than 80,000 low- and middle-income residents now live in homes ranging from modest one-room units to spacious houses, with shared courtyards for families.\n\nHe also designed mixed-income housing for a life insurance corporation in Ahmedabad (1973), which combines income groups on three floors of a pyramidal housing block approached through a common staircase. The Vidhyadhar Nagar Master Plan and Urban Design in Jaipur (1984) features channels for both water harvesting and distribution. (The Vidhyadhar housing plan recalled Mr. Doshi\u2019s work with Le Corbusier in Chandigarh, with its wide central avenues, and a study of Jaipur\u2019s Old City.)\n\n\u201cHousing as shelter is but one aspect of these projects,\u201d the Pritzker jury said in its citation. \u201cThe entire planning of the community, the scale, the creation of public, semipublic and private spaces are a testament to his understanding of how cities work and the importance of the urban design.\u201d\n\nMr. Doshi\u2019s emphasis on communal spaces is reflected in his own work studio, Sangath (roughly translated as \u201cmoving together\u201d), which includes a garden and outdoor amphitheater, spaces designed to foster the exchange of ideas. The mosaic tile in his studio also appears in the undulating roof of Mr. Doshi\u2019s underground art gallery in Ahmedabad, Amdavad ni Gufa (1994), which features the artwork of Maqbool Fida Husain.\n\nImage The undulating underground art gallery Amdavad ni Gufa in Ahmedabad (1994) features the work of Maqbool Fida Husain.

The architect said he has founded six schools, including the School of Architecture and Planning in Ahmedabad (1966-2012), where he is the dean emeritus. It was renamed CEPT University in 2002.\n\nHis educational buildings include the Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore (1977-92), a series of interwoven streets, courts and classrooms inspired by traditional, mazelike temple cities in southern India.\n\nBorn in Pune, India, in 1927, Mr. Doshi began his architecture studies in 1947 at the Sir JJ School of Architecture in Mumbai. He then moved to London and to Le Corbusier\u2019s atelier in Paris, where in the 1950s he helped work on Chandigarh, the experimental Modernist city about 150 miles north of New Delhi. Mr. Doshi ultimately settled in Ahmedabad, where he helped supervise the construction of Le Corbusier\u2019s Mill Owners\u2019 Association Building (1954) and worked on other Corbusier projects, including the Sarabhai House in Ahmedabad (1955).\n\nIn 1956, Mr. Doshi founded his own practice, Vastushilpa \u2014 now Vastushilpa Consultants \u2014 which has five partners and 60 employees.\n\nThe firm\u2019s more than 100 projects include the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad (1962), on which Mr. Doshi worked as an associate for Louis Kahn \u2014 an occasional collaboration that lasted more than a decade.\n\nHis work is deeply evocative of Indian history and culture, drawing on the grandeur of shrines and temples, the bustle of city streets and the local materials from his grandfather\u2019s furniture workshop.\n\nImage The Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore (1977-92), inspired by traditional Indian cities and temples, integrates \u201cnature as well as human activities,\u201d Mr. Doshi said. Credit VSF\n\nHe does not set out to design an iconic structure. Rather, Mr. Doshi approaches his projects with an eye toward seeding miniature societies that its residents can expand and animate over time.\n\n\u201cArchitecture is not a static building \u2014 it\u2019s a living organism,\u201d he said. \u201cHow do we add on coffee shops, restaurants, bookshops, so you can use the building? Can we bring life into what we create?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is the role of an architect today?\u201d Mr. Doshi added. \u201cAre we going to be a service provider working for a client, or are we going to be useful to the society at large?\u201d\n\nImage Formerly known as the Center for Environmental Planning and Technology, now CEPT University, in Ahmedabad, India.

Far from constituting the principal opposition to President Emmanuel Macron, a promise she made last year, her voice in the National Assembly is inaudible. The influence of the Front\u2019s few parliamentary deputies is negligible. The party has virtually disappeared as a national force.\n\nThe party congress this weekend in Lille was intended, in part, to reverse this. Ms. Le Pen has received authorization to change the National Front\u2019s name, still associated with the party\u2019s founder, her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, and his years of Holocaust denial and association with Nazi collaborators.\n\nKicked out of the party by his daughter in 2015, Mr. Le Pen called a name change \u201csuicidal\u201d in a recent interview. For the first time since the Front was founded in 1972, he is not attending the party congress.\n\nMs. Le Pen has herself expressed ambivalence about continuing in the role of party president, and some party activists interviewed here also suggested the Front\u2019s future is not inevitably tied to the woman who inherited the leadership from her father.\n\n\u201cFor now we\u2019re with Marine Le Pen.

About 100 readers responded. Here are a selection of them, lightly edited for clarity and length.\n\n\u201cThe Brothers Garcia\u201d on Nickelodeon. It was my happiest TV day ever! The family on TV looked and acted very much like mine, and everybody at school loved it! The show gave me the \u201cendorsement\u201d I had been craving all my (short) life.\n\n\u2014 Alex Gonzalez\n\nThe first time I saw myself on the big screen was when \u201cGone With the Wind\u201d came out and had Hattie McDaniel as the maid. I am 74 years old and I have seen a lot of racism in my life but \u201cGone With the Wind\u201d was the worst. It depicted a black women as a slave, who at the same time had power. At the time of the film I didn\u2019t really understand a lot about racism and the fact that I was a second-class person. A lot has changed, but a lot has not.\n\n\u2014 Gwendolyn Morgan\n\nI always liked \u201cIn the Heat of the Night\u201d because as a well-spoken, professional black man, I have found myself in Sidney Poitier\u2019s character\u2019s position: People can\u2019t figure me out. Like when someone asks Poitier: \u201cWhy are you wearing white man\u2019s clothes?\u201d I get that look today sometimes!\n\n\u2014 Andre Graves\n\nI first saw black actors who made an impression on me during the 1970s era of Blaxploitation films. \u201cShaft,\u201d \u201cSuperfly,\u201d Pam Grier, etc ... They looked like people in my St. Albans and Jamaica, Queens, neighborhood.\n\n\u2014 DeBorah Palmer\n\nI remember watching \u201cMulan,\u201d which came out when I was in middle school, and absolutely freaking out. I\u2019m not Chinese; I\u2019m Korean and was adopted by a white family as a baby, but in a media landscape that still largely excludes people of East Asian descent, I\u2019ll celebrate what I can get.\n\n\u2014 Amanda McClendon\n\nI\u2019m a white woman. Moira Shearer in \u201cRed Shoes.\u201d I was perhaps 8 years old. I grew up in a small town in North Texas. As a child I loved \u201cSong of the South\u201d and had read \u201cUncle Remus\u201d before I saw it. I know it\u2019s not politically correct now, but this film mirrored the kindness, warmth and wisdom I received as a child from African-Americans who worked in our house.\n\n\u2014 Mavis Bryant\n\nAs a black South African, and an African in particular, I felt a deep sense of joy at how \u201cBlack Panther\u201d tried to portray African culture. For once, Africans were good people in a movie, although it was fictional.\n\n\u2014 Khalifah Makgotlho\n\nThe 1972 film \u201cBlack Girl,\u201d starring Peggy Pettit as an aspiring modern dancer.

As someone adopted from China and raised in a predominantly white town, \u201cMulan\u201d was my premier exposure to Asian beauty and culture. Her story\u2019s message about turning adversity into strength sticks with me always.\n\n\u2014 MaiLei Meyers\n\nThe first time I saw gay men represented in film, who felt real and relatable, was in \u201cMy Beautiful Laundrette.\u201d Being gay isn\u2019t what the movie was about, these two characters just were, and that one was brown and the other white and working class made it even better.\n\n\u2014 Michael Ginther\n\n\u201cDrumline,\u201d featuring Nick Cannon, in 2002 and \u201cYou Got Served\u201d in 2004.

It made me want to cry with relief.\n\n\u2014 Dawn Reed\n\nGrowing up Italian and plus-size, I never saw women like me in the movies. The closest thing to representation I saw was \u201cThe Godfather,\u201d but my family wasn\u2019t violent or in organized crime so I couldn\u2019t relate. I\u2019m still waiting to see characters like me.\n\n\u2014 Tiffany Magazzeni\n\nI\u2019m still waiting to see myself. I mean there is Michelle Yeoh, an Asian actress in the 1997 movie \u201cTomorrow Never Dies.\u201d She\u2019s not me, but I loved that her character defies the usual Hollywood stereotypes for Asians. But she is not American and I\u2019m not at all a Bond woman. I grew up watching movies and I love the old Hollywood movies especially, but it makes me sad to realize that Hollywood\u2019s portrayal of Asians has been mocking or missing for most of its history. Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan are also imports. There just aren\u2019t any homegrown Asian-American filmmakers yet.\n\n\u2014 Lillian Hsu\n\nI am an African-American man born in 1960, raised in Southern California. The first time I remember seeing someone who looked like me represented on screen in the way I saw myself was in 1967.

Through some common coming-of-age feelings of loneliness and confusion, but also in better understanding the differences, I learned more about myself.\n\n\u2014 Sally Otis\n\nAlthough I am white, I am Jewish with \u201cbig\u201d hair, raised in the Bronx. I saw myself reflected in \u201cFunny Girl.\u201d With a New York City backdrop, song lyrics and Barbra Streisand\u2019s delivery, I felt for the first time, in the eyes of the larger world, at age 12, accepted.\n\n\u2014 Jill Sager\n\nImage Diahann Carroll and Sidney Poitier in \"Paris Blues.\" Credit Kino Lorber\n\nI am 70 years old and watched classic Hollywood movies on television during the 1950s and \u201960s.

Credit Melissa Lyttle for The New York Times\n\nGood neighbors\n\nFive years ago we moved from Torrance to two floors near the top of the 801 Tower in downtown Los Angeles.\n\nShortly after we moved here, the woman who at the time at the time was the C.E.O. of Greenland USA, the U.S. subsidiary of a Chinese construction firm, made a formal visit about a skyscraper they were building across the way.\n\nShe asked if we would mind if they built it a little higher, which could obstruct our view. We both knew it was just a courtesy, but I thought her old-world charm was very classy. We\u2019re now one of their preferred mortgage lenders.\n\nAn open-door policy\n\nMy office is just past the reception area as you exit the elevator. I chose that location by design, to be accessible. I also leave my door open since I believe closed doors can appear ominous and threatening.\n\nTwo of our female executives and I designed our entire space with an architect and a designer. We have both Asian and American customers, and I wanted the area to reflect the two cultures. Having lived on three continents, I had a feeling about what that might look like: bright colors to jolt people into happiness about when they arrive, and free-flowing space.\n\nImage The office contains elements of both Asian and American cultures.

I use the cricket bats on the weekends with my sons, like an American family goes outside and throws the football around.\n\nMy father\u2019s walking stick is in the corner. I was schooled in the British system of education, which has a formality that never leaves you. It means that sometimes you feel you\u2019re a stranger in a strange land.\n\nSting moved to the U.S. like I did, and when he came out with \u201cEnglishman in New York,\u201d it resonated with me, especially the lines \u201cSee me walking down Fifth Avenue, A walking cane here at my side.\u201d\n\nYou occasionally see walking sticks in English movies, and my father and other Pakistani men used them to shoo away stray dogs on the road.\n\nCloseness and discipline\n\nI hold meetings with my staff at the oval glass-topped table so that the distance between us is never more than a few feet.\n\nI also use the table as a desk, but I spend much of my time at my standing desk. I switched to it about 10 years ago after a former Royal Navy officer impressed upon me that part of his training was learning to stand watch for 10 hours at a time. I was fascinated by the idea that building discipline into humdrum activities like responding to emails is a persistent way of remaining alert all day.\n\nKeeping time\n\nEarlier in my career I worked at Citibank. The blue clock, a memento, marks the tremendous success of its revolutionary digital services platform, myCiti, which launched in 2001. It helped to boost my career and survives to this day.\n\nImage Mr. Menai\u2019s copy of \u201dThe Spectator.\" Credit Melissa Lyttle for The New York Times\n\nImage Along with favorite books and his grandfather\u2019s fountain pens, Mr. Menai keeps a note from his then 8-year-old son.

My most prized literary possession is a 300-year-old compilation of \u201cThe Spectator,\u201d a periodical that described basic social obligations during that time.\n\nFamily heirlooms\n\nWhen I was 18, I brought a mug from my college, Coe College in Iowa, to the woman in Pakistan who would become my wife. I keep it here now, along with my grandfather\u2019s fountain pens. I also have the note my then 8-year-old son Nabi wrote with one when I showed him how to fill the bladder with ink.

The shoes remind me of how certain ersatz practices can seem perfectly normal until the march of history exposes them as absurd.\n\nIt is our job to think critically and question whether certain current practices are the foot-binding of our age.\n\nOrder Reprints | Today\u2019s Paper | Subscribe A version of this article appears in print on , on Page BU 2 of the New York edition with the headline: Bridging Cultures in Downtown Los Angeles\n\n\n\n\n\n", "keywords": ["bridges", "angeles", "lyttle", "melissa", "credit", "president", "usa", "walking", "downtown", "cultures", "bank", "york", "los"], "polarity": 0.1271839623600187, "subjectivity": 0.4025149889234396},

The approach seems to be working. In February, the Young Adult Library Services Association named \u201cLighter Than My Shadow,\u201d a graphic novel by Katie Green about a young woman\u2019s battle with eating disorders, one of the top 10 \u201cgreat graphic novels for teens\u201d published in 2017. During our interview, Mr. Steward, 40, talked about his career path, diversity in comics, the challenges of the industry and more. These are edited excerpts from that conversation.\n\nHow did you get your start?\n\n\n\nI went to college at American University and graduated with a degree in international business marketing. Then I worked for my dad\u2019s company, World Wide Technology, and realized very quickly it was not for me. Over a dinner, my dad said, \u201cIf you\u2019re doing something you\u2019re passionate about, you\u2019ll never work a day in your life.\u201d That stuck with me and got my wheels turning about what I was really passionate about.\n\nWhat comics did you like as a kid?\n\nI had a Marvel encyclopedia. I didn\u2019t get access to real comic books until around the time Milestone, a comic publishing imprint that showcased African-American superheroes, came out. I remember it was cool to have characters that I could see myself in. When I discovered Comixology, a digital distributor of comics, I started reading again. My girlfriend at the time, who is now my wife, was an avid prose reader. We would be hanging by the pool, and she would read her books and I would read comics.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Digital comics were on the forefront of all that. You could do flip books and light animation and add soundscapes. Carl Reed, a co-founder of Lion Forge, was working in animation and was looking for the next thing, too. We got together with a couple of other guys and started exploring: Who are the players? What are they doing? Is the market saturated? We wanted to use digital as the litmus test for what you should print. You could tell the retailer: \u201cThis title sold well first digitally. We think people will look for it in the store to collect.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhy did you feel the timing was right for Lion Forge\u2019s diverse heroes?\n\nThe New 52 was launching at DC, and I remember distinctly they had relaunched Static Shock, which is cool because they brought that title to the forefront, but then they didn\u2019t have any black creators on it. I remember thinking, \u201cWhat is this?\u201d It was kind of like a reflection of what someone else thinks that an African-American person is, which is different from actually having more of an authentic representation. Whatever group we are representing, we are definitely having someone of that group be a part of it.\n\nHow did you approach creating these comics and catering to the audience?\n\nI feel like for everybody to participate, you have to have representation that looks like everyone in this country. We\u2019ve been careful to make sure that it is an inclusive line of characters. Kind of like the United Colors of Benetton [laughs], but it feels natural and organic. Another thing is not only looking at core comic book readers, but how can you reach those folks interested in comics but maybe haven\u2019t been invited in? Anybody who comes to our site or our catalog of books will find something there for them. I feel I achieved that goal in the last year with \u201cLighter Than My Shadow.\u201d My wife hasn\u2019t really picked up one of our books \u2014 other than when I\u2019ve asked her to.

Even as we saw parts of ourselves in Meg\u2019s heroism, we also had to resist our own invisibility in a novel that was unable or unwilling to imagine any people of color as inhabitants of the many planets, including Earth, to which its characters traveled. Such racial myopia is not L\u2019Engle\u2019s alone. After much debate in the publishing industry, children\u2019s literature is more diverse today than ever before but still is far from representative. Of some 3,500 children\u2019s books received from United States publishers in 2017 by the Cooperative Children\u2019s Book Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, 116 were by black authors and 319 were about African-American characters, the center said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

So instead of seeing my full self in Meg, I ended up cherry-picking the traits to which I could relate: her bravery and intelligence, or even more rare her feelings of abandonment and anger caused by her father\u2019s absence.\n\nAyana Mathis, the African-American author of the best-selling novel \u201cThe Twelve Tribes of Hattie,\u201d had a similar disconnect with this novel even though it remains her favorite book, alongside Mildred D. Taylor\u2019s \u201cRoll of Thunder, Hear My Cry\u201d (1976).\n\n\u201cMy thoughts on the book have nothing to do with my identifying with Meg,\u201d Ms. Mathis told me in a phone interview. \u201cBut I was intellectually challenged by it in a way that few books written for my age group at the time did. It expanded me but it also scared me and not with cheap thrills, but because it asked such compelling questions about evil. IT was a brain that was frightening and instructive.\u201d\n\nIt was only when the director Ava DuVernay announced that Storm Reid would play Meg as a biracial girl in the screen adaptation that my relationship with the character started to change. Ms. Reid described Meg as \u201can African-American girl that is smart, that is beautiful and that basically realizes that she is enough.\u201d Through this awareness, the actress added, Meg \u201cjust taps into her superpowers to be able to save her dad, her brother and save the world.\u201d\n\nThis revision \u2014 alongside the film\u2019s broader multiracial cast, which includes Mindy Kaling, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Reese Witherspoon and Oprah Winfrey \u2014 not only expands the feminist reach of L\u2019Engle\u2019s original vision, but also directly challenges the overwhelming absence of girls of color as leads in Hollywood films in general, and science-fiction films in particular. As recently as 2012, controversy greeted Amandla Stenberg when she played Rue in the first \u201cHunger Games\u201d movie. Rue was a black character in the dystopian novel it was based on, but fans seemed not to realize it and complained loudly about the casting. Ms. Reid\u2019s turn as Meg, by contrast, seems to have only increased fan anticipation for the movie.\n\nMore radically, Ms. DuVernay\u2019s choice for Meg helps redefine our notions of the universal. Rather than assume children of color will seamlessly identify with Meg as we do with the book or with the young, white heroines of the \u201cHunger Games\u201d or \u201cDivergent\u201d franchise, this film gives us a different, racially inflected female future and present.\n\nAnd that changes how I now appreciate the book.\n\nIt is still my favorite from childhood, but now, rather than contort myself into Meg, I am able to see how the novel\u2019s play with time and space continues to influence me as an African-American writer. I\u2019m obsessed with how people, events and cultural objects from the past shape our understandings of race and gender in the present. \u201cA Wrinkle in Time\u201d might not ask the same questions that I do now, but it was the first novel I ever read that explored multiple time dimensions and gave me permission to imagine history as incomplete, unfolding, and a phenomenon with hopes that can be taken up by successive generations.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter I was done with the novel this time, I put my copy on my 5-year-old daughter\u2019s bookshelf, for I am comforted by what she is now able to find in \u201cA Wrinkle in Time.\u201d Though we contemporary viewers and readers are unable to engage in interplanetary travel like Meg, Ms. DuVernay\u2019s version takes us somewhere even more substantive. By emphasizing diversity over dystopia, her film does not simply warn against the dangers of who we might become, but celebrates the vast richness of who we already are.", "keywords": ["saw", "africanamerican", "work", "wrinkle", "hard", "ms", "films", "novel", "childrens", "meg", "book", "color", "york", "sign"], "polarity": 0.09736605385956033, "subjectivity": 0.4660398043514926},

Al Sharpton, shuttling between one of his three offices. Credit Ruddy Roye for The New York Times Al Sharpton, Reconsidered Mr. Sharpton has been called a race hustler, a hero, a buffoon, a freedom fighter. He would prefer to be remembered as the Martin Luther King of the North. The Rev. Al Sharpton, shuttling between one of his three offices.CreditRuddy Roye for The New York Times\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen I was born,\u201d the Rev. Al Sharpton said through a plume of smoke, \u201cyou had all these movements. You had the anti-Vietnam War movement, you had the Panthers, you had King\u2019s nonviolent movement, you had N.A.A.C.P., you had black power \u2014 all this flurry of activity. Then Dr. King gets killed. And what happened? Who won the election in \u201968? Richard Nixon.\u201d\n\nFolded into a far corner of the Grand Havana Room, a private Midtown cigar club on the penthouse floor of 666 Fifth Avenue, Mr. Sharpton looked downright stately. Reporters have tagged along with him to the Grand Havana over the years, because few things get between Mr. Sharpton and his daily cigar, and because he understands it makes for a good scene.\n\n\u201cFast-forward 40 years later,\u201d he continued. \u201cBlack president. Black-on-black violence, Black Lives Matter, this, that and the other. All this fussing: Who\u2019s going to do this, and who\u2019s going to do that? Young, old, blah, blah, blah. Who wins? Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s easy for Mr. Sharpton to draw a line connecting the two eras: he met the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. way back when, and he\u2019s known Mr. Trump for over 30 years. America\u2019s present resembles its past \u2014 and that\u2019s why, Mr. Sharpton argues, he\u2019s uniquely positioned to take on President Trump, whom he considers as great a danger to civil rights as any he\u2019s fought against in his years as an activist.\n\nBut at the moment, he wasn\u2019t fighting; he was poring over his life and legacy in a cigar bar among bankers, politicians and celebrities. He was telling me about when he was jailed in 2001 for 90 days in Vieques, Puerto Rico, after he protested against the U.S. Navy using the island to test bombs and toxic chemicals. He and three other New York politicians were arrested.\n\nHe\u2019d moved on from that story when a distinguished-looking man in a suit walked up to our corner and greeted Mr. Sharpton like an old friend. It was, improbably, Roberto Ramirez, one of the three imprisoned with Mr. Sharpton in Vieques. I watched skeptically as they exchanged pleasantries.\n\nI later realized this is how millions of Americans view Mr. Sharpton. Coincidences come off as chicanery, and even his greatest achievements done with the best intentions seem somehow nefarious.\n\nTake the Grand Havana Room. It\u2019s owned by Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law. And while Mr. Sharpton and Mr. Ramirez had been attending the club for years, times are different now, and there are other places you could smoke a cigar. On some level, our interview, like so much of Sharpton\u2019s life, was a performance.\n\nMr. Sharpton has doggedly agitated for social justice for over 50 years, organizing, marching and fighting for black people. The deaths of Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner and Michael Brown have fueled the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement. Their cases are in the mainstream partly because their families picked up the phone and called Mr. Sharpton.\n\nBut these aren\u2019t the things that readily come to mind when people, particularly white people, think of him. He is known best for the worst thing he\u2019s done: His loud support of Tawana Brawley, an African-American teenager whose claims of abuse and rape by a gang of white men turned out to be a hoax.\n\nImage Mr. Sharpton taking a call on his SiriusXM show, \u201cKeepin\u2019 It Real.\u201d Credit Ruddy Roye for The New York Times\n\nMr. Sharpton is many things to many people \u2014 a freedom fighter, a boogeyman, a racial opportunist, an aging man just hanging on. But he has used his entire career to tell America a story about itself that it does not want to hear: that racism exists today, and is pervasive outside of the Deep South. And he has worked ceaselessly toward two intertwined, impossible goals. First, the demand for equal rights for all. The second is about securing his legacy as the Martin Luther King of the North.\n\n\u201cWhat I want it to be is I helped urbanize the King movement,\u201d Mr. Sharpton said. \u201cI was the one that could bring the King movement into the Northern, urban centers.\u201d But where Dr. King\u2019s activism led to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Mr. Sharpton\u2019s efforts haven\u2019t amounted to national reform.\n\nMr. Sharpton, 63, figured he\u2019d be retired by now. He thought he\u2019d keep his Sunday-morning MSNBC program, \u201cPoliticsNation,\u201d and his daily radio show, \u201cKeepin\u2019 It Real.\u201d He said he was ready to name a successor to his civil rights organization, the National Action Network, and the marching, strategizing and agitating that came with it. All that was left to do was build a civil rights museum in Harlem. But riding off into a life of punditry isn\u2019t an option with Mr. Trump in office. Mr. Sharpton said he and his allies thought they were poised to help a President Hillary Clinton pass national police reform legislation. His mission is now different, and more modest.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to preserve what you\u2019ve got done,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will not matter if he revokes the Voting Rights Act, and the Civil Rights Act of Dr. King. You need to preserve the racial profiling laws, and police reform like stop and frisk,\u201d he continued. \u201cOtherwise, it\u2019ll be a bygone era.\u201d\n\nImage A 7-year-old Al Sharpton preaches at Washington Temple in Brooklyn, 1961. Credit New York Times Co., via Getty Images\n\nNow 133 pounds, Mr. Sharpton is less than half the man he was for much of his life. A morning salad and banana serve as his only real sustenance for the day, and in my time with him, he drank nothing but green tea \u2014 not even water. His flamboyant conk is now steely gray, slicked back over his thinning crown. He\u2019s quick to joke, but he rarely laughs. He has long since replaced his sweats with bespoke suits.\n\nBut the new Al Sharpton is the same person he always was.\n\nAlfred Charles Sharpton Jr. was born in 1954 to a middle-class family who had a house in a nice neighborhood in Queens. At 4, before he even knew how to read, young Al began preaching, and often practiced at home in his mother\u2019s robe. When he was just a boy, his mother connected Al with two pastors, Bishop F.D. Washington and the Rev. Dr. Bill Jones. They called him Boy Wonder, and he toured the country preaching before he was even a teenager. In 1967, Dr. Jones introduced the young preacher to a 26-year-old civil-rights activist named Jesse Jackson. Mr. Jackson took him under his wing, and Al decided he wanted to spend his life like the men who looked after him, fighting for civil rights in the prophetic tradition of Dr. King, who was assassinated when Mr. Sharpton was 13.\n\nIn 1971, when he was 16, Mr. Sharpton founded his first civil rights organization, the National Youth Movement, with money from Bayard Rustin, the chief organizer of the 1963 March on Washington. He met James Brown, who adopted him as his godson in 1973; for most of the next decade, Mr. Sharpton was always at the singer\u2019s side. If Jesse Jackson taught Mr. Sharpton how to organize, it was James Brown who taught him how to perform.\n\n\u201cI would watch what moves and what songs excited people, and I would take notes,\u201d Mr. Sharpton told me. \u201cBecause you\u2019ve got to keep people\u2019s attention.\u201d\n\nImage Mr. Sharpton backstage in 1974 at Madison Square Garden with James Brown, who was his godfather. Credit Waring Abbott/Getty Images\n\nIn 1980, Sharpton married Kathy Jordan, one of James Brown\u2019s backup singers. They had two daughters, and he spent much of the 1980s scraping together a living in New York as a minister and civil rights activist.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Don King brokered a meeting between Mr. Sharpton and Donald Trump with the idea that Mr. Sharpton could get James Brown to play one of Mr. Trump\u2019s Atlantic City casinos. They boarded Mr. Trump\u2019s helicopter, and the three flew to Atlantic City. \u201cIt was probably the most surreal 45 minutes of my life,\u201d Mr. Sharpton remembered. \u201cJust two guys talking nonstop, not listening to a word each other said.\u201d\n\nThen came the event that sealed Mr. Sharpton\u2019s future. On the night of Dec. 19, 1986, four black men were stranded in Queens when their car broke down. Three of them went looking for help. They stopped at New Park Pizzeria, in Howard Beach, an all-white neighborhood. As they ate, they encountered and argued with some white teenagers, who left and returned with a mob, some wielding baseball bats, who attacked them. One of them, Michael Griffith, was beaten badly and chased out onto the Belt Parkway, where he was struck by a car and killed.\n\nWhite New Yorkers, blind to the city\u2019s racism, were stunned. Mayor Edward I. Koch called it a lynching.\n\n\u201cTo have it happen in New York City,\u201d he said. \u201cUnbelievable.\u201d\n\nThe next weekend, over a thousand protesters marched through Howard Beach. Once the progression made it to New Park Pizzeria, a 32-year-old Sharpton, rotund, with a track suit and a perm, went in and ordered a slice.\n\n\u201cIn the biggest metropolis in the world, a black kid is dead because of the color of his skin,\u201d Mr. Sharpton said at the time.\n\nIn the end, a special prosecutor was assigned to the case, and three white attackers were convicted of second-degree manslaughter.\n\nImage Before the protest march in Howard Beach, where Michael Griffith was beaten and chased by a mob of white teenagers onto the Belt Parkway, where he was hit by a car and killed. Credit Allan Tannenbaum/Getty Images\n\nMr. Sharpton talks about Howard Beach all the time. It was his big break, his first major success as a strategist. Nearly as bracing as the details of Mr. Griffith\u2019s death were the newscasts of enraged white locals who had to be separated by police from diverse, nonviolent demonstrators. Mr. Sharpton\u2019s demonstrations were a stroke of visual genius.\n\nHe was a city kid who had no illusions about racial oppression. He knew even in progressive, cosmopolitan enclaves, racism was still tightly woven into the American fabric.\n\n\u201cHoward Beach was the first public awakening of Northern racism,\u201d Mr. Sharpton asserted. \u201cPeople were in denial before that.\u201d\n\nThis revisionism omits urban activists who came before. Still, for white New Yorkers in the late 1980s, it was horrifying. Howard Beach implicated everyone.\n\nJust as quickly came Mr. Sharpton\u2019s disaster.\n\nIn November 1987, a 15-year-old black girl who had been missing for four days was found in a trash bag near her family\u2019s old apartment building in Wappingers Falls, N.Y. Feces were smeared in her hair, and racist epithets were written with charcoal on her body. She said she\u2019d been kidnapped, tortured and raped by a group of six white men and left for dead. Her name was Tawana Brawley.\n\n\u201cWe have the facts and the evidence that an assistant district attorney and a state trooper did this,\u201d Mr. Sharpton said at a rally the following June. It was the peak of months of protests that dominated the news and captivated the tabloids.\n\nImage Mr. Sharpton and Tawana Brawley at a Baptist church in Brooklyn in 1988. Ms. Brawley said that she was raped and abused by a gang of white men; her claims were later proved to be a hoax. Credit Chester Higgins Jr./The New York Times\n\nThe charges were absolutely shocking, and in the end, they were not true. There was no evidence of rape, or even exposure to the elements. Ms. Brawley\u2019s shoes were sliced, but there were no lacerations on her feet. The slurs written on her were upside-down. The feces were determined to have come from a neighbor\u2019s dog. In September 1988, following a seven-month inquiry, a grand jury ruled it a hoax. Mr. Sharpton and Ms. Brawley\u2019s lawyers were successfully sued for defamation. It could have been the end of Al Sharpton as a public figure, but he survived.\n\n\u201cWhy did I get involved with Brawley?\u201d Mr. Sharpton asked rhetorically. \u201cBecause I believe the criminal justice system is unfair.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between me believing her and me believing the kid out in Howard Beach wasn\u2019t out there selling drugs?\u201d\n\nAfter the Brawley case, Mr. Sharpton\u2019s past was scrutinized. He had failed to file his tax returns for three years running, and he owed his landlord money. He had worked as a federal informant, recording conversations with the mob and Don King, and he was even accused of spying on black civil rights activists.\n\nIn 1989, Mr. Sharpton was indicted on a charge of stealing a quarter-million dollars from the National Youth Movement. He was acquitted of all charges, but the organization folded. He went on to launch the National Action Network in 1991.\n\nMany New Yorkers felt more comfortable seeing Mr. Sharpton as a buffoon or a race-baiter. The Brawley case cemented it. And for many, he will never escape.\n\n\u201cAl Sharpton is not a credible individual,\u201d Edward Mullins, the president of the Sergeants Benevolent Association, told The Observer in 2014 when Mr. Sharpton again emerged as a vocal critic of the police after Eric Garner died after a chokehold administered by Officer Daniel Pantaleo on Staten Island that July. \u201cHe never has been, yet he\u2019s all over the media. He gets front page. He\u2019s allowed to sit in City Hall and threaten the mayor.\u201d\n\nIt is convenient, even necessary, for the defenders of Officer Pantaleo to delegitimize Mr. Sharpton.\n\n\u201cWhatever you want to say about Al Sharpton, the reason he\u2019s sustained all these years is because he deals with stuff that y\u2019all have not stopped,\u201d Mr. Sharpton recently mused in his office in NBC\u2019s Midtown headquarters.\n\n\u201cYou want to make him go away? Why don\u2019t you stop killing blacks then?\u201d\n\nAnd even today, Mr. Sharpton claims to have no regrets for the Tawana Brawley episode. \u201cIf I had to choose between a 15-year-old black girl and a white legal system that has always done us wrong, I\u2019m going with her,\u201d Mr. Sharpton said.\n\nImage Mr. Sharpton leading a rally in 1989 after the murder of Yusuf Hawkins, who was killed in the largely white Brooklyn neighborhood of Bensonhurst. Credit Michelle V. Agins/The New York Times\n\nFar from retreating, Mr. Sharpton in fact raised his profile. He ran for the United States Senate in 1988. He didn\u2019t even slow much when, in 1991 while leading protests in Brooklyn after a young black man named Yusuf Hawkins had been murdered by a white mob in Bensonhurst, Mr. Sharpton himself was stabbed in the chest. He ran for the Senate again in 1992 and 1994, and he ran for New York City mayor in 1997. In 2004, he ran for president. He lost every race.\n\nMr. Sharpton seems ubiquitous, behind a podium or leading a protest following every outrage.\n\n\u201cThere are different rules when it\u2019s our kids lying dead on the ground,\u201d said Benjamin L. Crump, the Florida civil rights lawyer who represented the family of Trayvon Martin, who was killed in 2012 when he looked suspicious to George Zimmerman, who was working a neighborhood watch shift. Mr. Crump was retained by Trayvon Martin\u2019s parents. He assumed that local police would arrest Mr. Zimmerman. When they didn\u2019t, Mr. Crump called Mr. Sharpton. \u201cRev. takes the calls, man,\u201d Mr. Crump said. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t take the calls until it\u2019s popular.\u201d\n\nIn August 2014, when Officer Darren Wilson killed Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., Mr. Brown\u2019s grandfather called Mr. Sharpton.\n\n\u201cWhat I always say when they say I\u2019m an ambulance-chaser,\u201d Mr. Sharpton said, \u201cis that I\u2019m the ambulance. They knew that I would come.\u201d\n\nImage Mr. Sharpton at the book party for \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d with the boxing promoter Don King and the author, Donald Trump. Credit Ron Galella/WireImage, via Getty Images\n\nMr. Trump dove into politics in 2011 by peddling the conspiracy theory that President Barack Obama was born in Kenya, and therefore an illegitimate leader. In 2012, he tweeted that \u201can extremely credible source\u201d had informed him that Mr. Obama\u2019s birth certificate was a fraud. Mr. Sharpton, both on the radio and his new MSNBC show, hammered Mr. Trump every night. Wounded, Mr. Trump summoned Mr. Sharpton to Trump Tower.\n\n\u201c\u2018I\u2019m not a racist! You know me, Al,\u2019\u201d Mr. Sharpton said Mr. Trump told him. \u201cI said, \u2018But what you\u2019re saying is racist.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe two men are linked, and there\u2019s an odd mutual respect that has survived the years. They\u2019re both outsiders, New York creations who could not and would not exist anywhere else.\n\n\u201cI think we filled a need at the times that we rose,\u201d Mr. Sharpton said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve been delivering for parts of America that were marginalized. Even Trump.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump cut the ribbon at Mr. Sharpton\u2019s National Action Network convention in 2002, and he attended the convention again in 2006. \u201cWe were all right,\u201d Mr. Sharpton allowed. (The White House did not respond to multiple requests for comment.)\n\nAnd now he sees Mr. Trump as the threat to not only Dr. King\u2019s legacy, but to his as well.\n\n\u201cFifty years after King was killed, Trump is president,\u201d Mr. Sharpton said. \u201cI really am scared that Trump\u2019s going to dismantle all the things we did.\u201d\n\nImage Mr. Sharpton speaking at the National Action Network, the civil rights organization he founded in Harlem. At left is Benjamin Crump, the Florida lawyer who represented Trayvon Martin\u2019s parents. Credit Ruddy Roye for The New York Times\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to imagine how Mr. Sharpton could prevent the government from rolling back civil rights gained with Dr. King.\n\n\u201cThe question to me is, why would you stop?\u201d he said. \u201cWhat did you do all of that for if you\u2019re just going to give up?\u201d\n\nMr. Sharpton lacks a clear legacy, and his fight with Mr. Trump appears in part a branding exercise. Most activists can\u2019t control how they\u2019re remembered; someone else ultimately writes their legacies once they\u2019re silenced or dead. But Mr. Sharpton is different. Regardless of what Mr. Trump does, Mr. Sharpton will spend the final chapter of his life building a civil rights museum in Harlem.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to cost me $50 to $100 million,\u201d Mr. Sharpton said. He added that he is negotiating between two potential sites, and he\u2019s still young enough to dedicate years of energy to the project.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a whole lot of civil rights history in the North across the board, black, Latino, L.G.B.T.Q., that has not been told,\u201d Mr. Sharpton said. There isn\u2019t anywhere for people to visit to learn about the fight for Northern civil rights. \u201cI want to build that landmark, and say this has been the struggle in the North. I\u2019m going to build that before I die.\u201d\n\nImage Mr. Sharpton with Jesse Jackson at the funeral of Michael Brown, who was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo., in 2014. Credit Richard Perry/The New York Times\n\nIts working name is the Civil Rights Museum of New York. He said he has no intention of making a shrine, but he will surely have a prominent place within.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s debatable if nonviolence is as good as self-defense,\u201d Mr. Sharpton said. \u201cIt\u2019s debatable if we needed King\u2019s love message or Malcolm\u2019s black pride more. What\u2019s not debatable is that Martin Luther King made sure that Rosa Parks was on the front of the bus, and we can now sit on the front of the bus.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not debatable that you did not have stop and frisk in New York City after we went after it,\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201c\u2018Sharpton\u2019s a demagogue,\u2019\u201d he said, mocking critics. \u201cWhatever. Is stop and frisk here? No. At the end of the day, when it\u2019s all over, people will not care about my hairstyle or my old tracksuit. They will say, \u2018He did this, this, this, and this.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe simply needs to not lose ground under the current administration.\n\nThe last time Mr. Sharpton had any contact with Mr. Trump, he said, was at the 40th anniversary show of \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d Both men had hosted the show at some point, and so they were invited. It was February 2015, roughly four months before Mr. Trump descended the escalator in Trump Tower to declare his candidacy for president. They ran into each other backstage and shook hands.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018Al, you still beat me up,\u2019\u201d Mr. Sharpton recalled, impersonating Mr. Trump. \u201c\u2018But hey, you gotta do what you gotta do, and I gotta do what I gotta do,\u2019\u201d Mr. Sharpton recounted. \u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019m gonna tell you what you\u2019re doing is wrong.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt was a good scene. It flattered Mr. Sharpton, made him sound like a hero. It might have been true.\n\nImage Mr. Sharpton in his office at the National Action Network. His assistant James Fields sits outside.

Ken Frazier on Death Row Cases and the Corporate Soul\n\nImage Kenneth Frazier, the chief executive of Merck. \u201cI actually don\u2019t see that big a conflict between meeting the needs of shareholders and meeting the needs of society,\u201d Mr. Frazier said. Credit Mike Cohen for The New York Times\n\nThe role of the chief executive has never been more complex \u2014 or more consequential.\n\nBusiness leaders today are reshaping the internet, reimagining health care, upending transportation and more. But being a chief executive is no longer just about running a company. It means taking political stands on everything from immigration to gun rights. It means weighing in on tariffs and taxes \u2014 all while balancing short-term profits with long-term goals, dealing with activist investors and attracting talented employees.\n\nIn an effort to better understand the world\u2019s top chief executives \u2014 where they\u2019re coming from and how they deal with the challenges they face \u2014 The New York Times is bringing back Corner Office.\n\nFor nearly 10 years, Corner Office featured conversations about leadership and management with some 500 senior executives. The new Corner Office will build on this foundation and also cover the big issues of the day, from climate change to artificial intelligence. We\u2019ll be talking to prominent chief executives at big companies, innovators at lesser-known start-ups and organizational leaders in philanthropy, sports and the arts.\n\nWe want you to join the conversation. Let us know whom we should interview, and what questions you want answered below. And stay tuned as we bring Corner Office to life with multimedia, how-to guides and live events.\n\nAs we considered whom to interview first, Kenneth C. Frazier, the chief executive of Merck, was right at the top of the list. Mr. Frazier has a powerful personal story and has built an exceptional career.\n\nRaised in a poor neighborhood in Philadelphia, Mr. Frazier attended Penn State University and Harvard Law School. He joined Merck in 1992, defending the company against major lawsuits while resisting calls to slash research and development budgets.\n\nLast year, Mr. Frazier made headlines as the first chief executive to resign from a presidential advisory council following Mr. Trump\u2019s equivocating response to an outburst of white nationalist violence in Charlottesville, Va. As perhaps the most prominent black chief executive in the country, his stance carried powerful symbolism.\n\nThe Times published an article last month about Mr. Frazier\u2019s decision to resign from the advisory role. This interview, which was condensed and edited for clarity, was conducted at Merck\u2019s headquarters in Kenilworth, N.J.\n\nYou once said that even though your father was a janitor, you believed he could have been a C.E.O.\n\nMy father was born in the year 1900 in South Carolina, and he grew up at a time where being an African-American child in the American South was to be deprived of access to anything close to a reasonable education. He only had three years of formal education, but he was self-taught. He read two newspapers a day. He could\u2019ve done a lot of things had he been born when I was born.\n\nTell me about his father.\n\nMy grandfather on my paternal side, Richard Frazier, was born in the late 1850s, and therefore was born into slavery, but was a sharecropper in South Carolina for his entire life. And one of the great things about my grandfather was that he sent my father north before he reached the age of maturity so that he, too, wouldn\u2019t become indebted to the land.\n\nHow did your parents raise you?\n\nI had a fantastic upbringing by two parents who cared deeply about their children, but more importantly believed that anything was possible for their children, and in some ways almost brainwashed us to be successful. They believed that despite the history of this country as it related to African-Americans, that for my siblings and I, that there would be tremendous opportunity. They also instilled that it was our responsibility to take advantage of the opportunities that they did not have.\n\nWhat drew you to the study of law?\n\nI\u2019ve always admired lawyers who use their power to affect social change, and Thurgood Marshall was always a childhood hero of mine.\n\nAfter graduating from Harvard Law School, you went to work at Drinker Biddle & Reath. Why there?\n\nI chose that firm in large part because they had a reputation of doing a lot of pro bono work. When I was at the firm, I read about the need in South Africa for law professors and lawyers to come from the U.S., because black law students in South Africa were obviously during apartheid only allowed to go to second-rate law schools.\n\nI lived one whole semester in Soweto. It was completely lawless. There were no streetlights. It was a completely separated area where people were contained, because the South African government\u2019s job, as it saw it, was to separate blacks from whites.\n\nBut what I remember more than anything else was interacting with people who their entire lives had been told that they were second class, that they were inferior, and how hard it was to get particularly the men to speak up in audible tones, because they had been in many ways told that their voice was not worth listening to. In addition to trying to teach people the substantive legal issues, it was a lot about trying to instill self-confidence.\n\n\u201cThe most important role of a leader is to safeguard the heritage and values of the company.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Ken Frazier\n\nYou also represented James Willie \u201cBo\u201d Cochran, a death row inmate. What was your first impression of his case?\n\nMy first reaction was, \u201cI\u2019m much too busy to take on another piece of pro bono litigation.\u201d But there were two younger lawyers in the firm who heard about the case, and they came to me and frankly they sort of shamed me into doing it.\n\nYou eventually won his freedom. What did that mean to you?\n\nIt was the high point of my professional career. This is a man who was facing an execution date for a crime he did not commit. And what I will never forget about Bo was that he had no sense of recrimination whatsoever. He was just thankful for every day that he had as a free man. It sort of reminds me of Nelson Mandela in the sense that he was able to live his life going forward without regard to trying to even scores.\n\nOne of the things that defined your early years at Merck was the defense against lawsuits over Vioxx, a painkiller that posed heart risk and was pulled off the market. Are there lessons to be learned from the way you approached that?\n\nThe central allegation that was underneath the Vioxx litigation was that this company put profit before patient safety. That went to the core of who we are as a company, and there was no way that we could allow that story to be unchallenged. We did not want Vioxx to become a verbal shorthand, like an Enron or something of that nature, for corporate wrongdoing. The most important role of a leader is to safeguard the heritage and values of the company.\n\nHow do you balance the pressure to deliver profits to public shareholders and also to make lifesaving drugs?\n\nI actually don\u2019t see that big a conflict between meeting the needs of shareholders and meeting the needs of society.\n\nVery early on in my tenure there was a lot of pressure being put on pharmaceutical C.E.O.s to cut their research budgets. And we value R & D as a company. It\u2019s who we are. It\u2019s the core of what we do. I made the decision that I wasn\u2019t going to cut our R & D budget, and that had some short-term negative consequences in terms of share price. But by taking those actions I think we were able to show that we really did care about what we said we were about as a company.\n\nThere are lots of examples of companies that have lost their way because they\u2019ve sort of lost their soul, which is a funny word to use, but companies do have souls.\n\nLast year, after President Trump\u2019s remarks following the violence in Charlottesville, you resigned from one of his advisory councils. What happened?\n\nIn that moment the president\u2019s response was one that I felt was not in concordance with my views, and I didn\u2019t think they were in concordance with the views that we claim to hold as a country. It was my view that to not take a stand on this would be viewed as a tacit endorsement of what had happened and what was said. I think words have consequences, and I think actions have consequences. I just felt that as a matter of my own personal conscience, I could not remain.\n\nWhat did you learn from the whole experience?\n\nC.E.O.s need to be very thoughtful and sober about the positions that they take publicly. Ultimately, if you believe strongly in something, you ought to say it, and you ought to say it in a very clear way.\n\nBill Horne in Newtonville, Mass., asks...\n\n\u201cIn what ways if any has your representation of prisoners on death row influenced your decisions as C.E.O.?\u201d\n\nWhat drew me to Merck was that the company\u2019s ethos had the same feel that pro bono work has, which is that you\u2019re really committed to serving your fellow human beings. I worked for 10 years to save one person\u2019s life in the context of the death penalty. Here we can make decisions every day with the stroke of the pen that can make lots of people\u2019s lives longer and healthier.\n\nHow do you prioritize your time?\n\nThere are three things that the C.E.O. should be focused on. Number one is that sense of purpose and direction that the company needs, making sure that that\u2019s always clear and people know what we\u2019re all about. The second thing is capital allocation. We only have so many resources. Making sure that you\u2019re putting those resources where you have the greatest opportunity. And the third, which I think by far is the most important, is to make sure that you have the right people in the most important jobs inside the company.\n\nWhat advice would you give to college graduates?\n\nI think people should seek adventure in life, as opposed to just allowing their ambitions to drive where they want to end up. Lots of people say, \u201cTell me what are the steps to get from here to the C.E.O.\u2019s office.\u201d I can say honestly I never sought to be a C.E.O. But what I\u2019ve always wanted was a new challenge, what I call an adventure. Seek adventure. Seek excitement in what you do.\n\nDavid Gelles is the Corner Office columnist and a business reporter.

The Baptist part is inherited, like baldness or dimples: Both of my grandfathers and three of my uncles were Baptist preachers, and my parents met as graduate students at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. Genes aside, the church \u2014 plastic chairs, pilling carpet and grape juice for communion \u2014 was the organizing institution of my childhood, where I met my closest friends and most of the significant adults in my life.\n\nChurch attendance has been in generational decline. I began calling around, exploring whether people in small towns were looking for community elsewhere and, with the white nationalist rallies so often in the news, whether young white people were looking for meaning in the grim sanctuaries of the alt-right.\n\nBut I kept hearing about something different. Pastors, theologians and sociologists were talking of how black worshipers were leaving white-majority churches. They were leaving quietly and not en masse, a family here, a single person there. But it was happening everywhere, a movement large enough for some to see the unraveling of decades of efforts at racial reconciliation.\n\nI would find someone on Facebook, a black worshiper who had posted about leaving her mostly white church, and then I would find someone in the same situation halfway across the country. They would both think they were going through this alone, yet the accounts would be remarkably similar, the timelines nearly identical, even some of the words and phrases the same. There had been, I discovered, some sharp reporting about this, particularly from the writer Deborah Jian Lee, but not as much as you would expect for an experience that seemed to be this broadly shared.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPeople spoke to me of being tired, let down, heartbroken. Political and cultural partitions that they had long overlooked at worship time now overshadowed every service. The realizations almost always began with the death of Trayvon Martin in 2012, and a sense that white church leaders or fellow worshipers did not want to talk about how a black teenager walking home from a 7-Eleven could end up dead. Sometimes the preacher would privately express sympathy, but also concern about how his white congregation would take it. Maybe there would be a meeting.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Around his neck were two rings on a silver chain. A double-looped black scarf grazed his sternum like a lei. Every so often he paused to adjust the scarf ever so slightly, as if confirming that it was still there. Hello, scarf.\n\nAt 68, Mr. Richie is as busy as he\u2019s ever been. There is \u201cIdol,\u201d of course. Beginning this month, there is also a return to \u201cAll the Hits,\u201d the residency at Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas, a place where a proven draw like Lionel Richie could conceivably fiesta forever. There is the home-goods line, whose Instagram feed features many photos of Lionel Richie\u2019s bejeweled hands touching jacquard towels and fine bed linens. There are also grandchildren, to whom the pop icon is Pop-Pop.\n\n\u201cFor a Gemini who probably has about 15 to 20 minutes of attention span,\u201d Mr. Richie said, \u201cthis is pretty darn good.\u201d\n\nAlthough he has made cameo appearances on both \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d and \u201cCanadian Idol\u201d (as well as their crosstown rival, NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Voice\u201d), his decision to join the judges\u2019 panel full time is a surprise. Like many artists whose achievements predate it, Mr. Richie has criticized the show over the years for promoting cookie-cutter talent. In 2009 he suggested to Blues & Soul magazine that \u201cIdol\u201d would have quickly sent Mick Jagger and James Brown packing.\n\nWhen reminded of these comments, Mr. Richie smiled and lowered his head until it was almost touching the table, as if he\u2019d just been ambushed with a cringeworthy childhood photo.\n\n\u201cWas I a fan of these shows?\u201d he said. \u201cAbsolutely not. I was not.\u201d\n\nBut when he was asked to join the reboot \u2014 \u201cIdol\u201d is getting a fresh start on ABC after 15 seasons on Fox that ended in April 2016 \u2014 Mr. Richie said, he began thinking about how best to make use of the platform. For years, he said, he\u2019s watched an increasingly dysfunctional music business fail to mentor artists for the long haul.\n\n\u201cFor two days a week, Professor Richie is going to talk about the reality of what it takes to be an artist,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead of sitting here moaning about how the world has changed since I started, I\u2019m going to tell them what it takes. You think it\u2019s just singing? No, it\u2019s not. What kind of style do you have? What kind of stamina do you have? How many times can you take \u2018No\u2019? How many times can you come back? That\u2019s an artist.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d executive producer, Trish Kinane, who worked on the Fox version of the show from Season 12 to 15, as well, said Mr. Richie genuinely wanted to share his expertise. \u201cI think the viewers can really smell it when people are fake, because they\u2019ve seen these shows so often,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it excited him to think that he could be helping more than one person, through this process, change their lives.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Perry said she insisted Mr. Richie join the panel after running into him one night at the Sunset Tower and spending hours listening to him talk about his experiences in the music industry. \u201cIt was just jaw-dropping,\u201d she said. \u201cI went to the producers and I put my foot down. I was like, Lionel Richie is the uncle, historian, the wisdom that we are missing on this show.\u201d\n\nHe has \u201cbountiful grace,\u201d she added. \u201cWhen he speaks, the whole room listens. He takes his time, he has patience, he doesn\u2019t feel the need to prove. He is Lionel Richie.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nHAD \u201cIDOL\u201d EXISTED in the 1960s, when Mr. Richie was of auditioning age, he would have gone nowhere near it. As a young man, he was painfully shy. He likes to say he thanks God for the Commodores, because without them, he\u2019d never have discovered Lionel Richie.\n\nHe was born in Tuskegee, Ala., and grew up on the campus of Tuskegee University, a few doors down from the Oaks, Booker T. Washington\u2019s former home. He was a freshman economics major at Tuskegee when one of his future bandmates spotted him carrying a saxophone case and offered him a spot in the band that would become the Commodores.\n\nAt the time, Mr. Richie said, he\u2019d been contemplating dropping out of school to join the Episcopalian clergy. Then he did his first show with the band. The curtain rose, Mr. Richie heard the sound of young women screaming in delight, and there went his interest in the priesthood.\n\nAfter a nationwide tour opening for the Jackson 5, the Commodores signed to Motown, and Mr. Richie began to learn the lessons only experience can teach. Once, before a show, he decided to say hello to the members of Parliament-Funkadelic, whose dressing room was down the hall. \u201cThe door opens,\u201d Mr. Richie recalled, \u201cand that was when I realized, This is not Kansas, ladies and gentlemen.\u201d\n\nMr. Richie, who had been an Air Explorer Scout back in Tuskegee, spent about 30 minutes in P-Funk\u2019s lair that night. \u201cEverybody was talented, everybody could sing, and everybody\u2019s naked,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re like, \u2018This is the record business, man.\u2019 \u201d\n\nWith the Commodores, Mr. Richie co-wrote the deathless wedding-reception staple \u201cBrick House,\u201d but soon discovered he had a knack for ballads.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI\u2019m your James Taylor guy, you know?\u201d he said. \u201cI was your Carole King guy. I was your Marvin Gaye guy. Very sensitive. One of the things I heard growing up was, \u2018Mr. and Mrs. Richie, the problem with Lionel is he\u2019s too sensitive.\u2019 And of course, all that meant was that I was a songwriter. I was not a football player, and I was not going to be a hunter. I\u2019m the guy that shot a bird one time and cried over the bird for the next two days, you know? That\u2019s just who I am.\u201d\n\nTuskegee was a bubble of black achievement in the pre-civil rights South, and Mr. Richie said he grew up insulated from many of the cold facts of race in America, including the de facto segregation of pop and R&B on commercial radio. When he began coming into his own as a writer he was almost willfully ignorant of those categories. His hits for the Commodores could be sentimental, even saccharine, but were also sneakily genre-defying. \u201cSail On\u201d is a lonely-loadout lament fit for a mid-70s Jackson Browne album; the 1977 smash \u201cEasy\u201d was pure country.\n\nIn 1978, the Commodores released the Richie-penned \u201cThree Times a Lady\u201d and many black radio stations drew the line, refusing \u2014 at the height of funk and disco \u2014 to play a waltz. Mr. Richie and the Motown promotion executive Skip Miller summoned a group of unconvinced D.J.s and program directors from around the country \u2014 \u201cMy biggest haters,\u201d Mr. Richie said \u2014 for a sit down at a restaurant on Sunset Boulevard. There, with Kanye Westian bravado, the not-yet-30-year-old Mr. Richie announced his desire to be the greatest songwriter who\u2019d ever lived \u2014 as opposed to the greatest black songwriter \u2014 and then asked them personally to give his record a shot.\n\n\u201cBut you\u2019ve got to play it for a week or two, just to make sure,\u201d he told them. \u201cYou can\u2019t put it on at 11 o\u2019clock at night. Put it on in drive time. If it doesn\u2019t go, I\u2019ll never bother you again.\u201d\n\nIt went. Mr. Richie\u2019s reputation grew. In 1980, Kenny Rogers called to commission a ballad, and Richie wrote, arranged and produced \u201cLady,\u201d the first record of that decade to top three different Billboard charts.\n\nAt Motown\u2019s urging he recorded a solo album, then another. He still assumed he\u2019d retire as a Commodore. He said everything changed after the 1984 Olympics. During the closing ceremony, in front of a worldwide TV audience, Mr. Richie performed \u201cAll Night Long,\u201d dancing on a mechanical riser like a single man atop a wedding cake.\n\nAt first, this didn\u2019t feel like a turning point. \u201cI left the house,\u201d Mr. Richie said, \u201cwent and ran around this field for 20 minutes, got back in the car and left the stadium.\u201d\n\nThen he stopped at an intersection. \u201cI am three cars back from the red light,\u201d he said, \u201cand people are walking up to the car.\u201d He tapped the table urgently, imitating the manic energy of a swarm of excited fans. In that moment, he said, \u201cI became \u2018Lionel Richie All Night Long.\u2019 Lionel Richie All Night Long! Lionel Richie All Night Long! These people have just gotten off the plane from Taipei, but they know Lionel Richie All Night Long.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThis period blurs together when he talks about it now. It wasn\u2019t all one year, but it feels that way. The Oscar nomination for \u201cEndless Love.\u201d The Olympics. Leaving the Commodores. Sitting with Michael Jackson, writing the USA for Africa charity single \u201cWe Are the World,\u201d and meeting Jackson\u2019s albino python Muscles, who slipped into the studio unnoticed and greeted Richie with open jaws. (\u201cLionel, he wants to say hello to you,\u201d Mr. Richie recalled Jackson said. \u201cWhy are you screaming?\u201d)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor a natural workaholic the pace was addictive at first, but Mr. Richie said being a star on that level also brought with it \u201cunbelievable stress.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the astronaut,\u201d Mr. Richie said, \u201cand everything on planet Earth is falling apart.\u201d\n\nHe went home to Tuskegee to care for his dying father. Doctors found nodules on his vocal cords. His marriage grew strained, then imploded in tabloid-ugly fashion \u2014 in 1988, his first wife, Brenda, was arrested on an assault charge after catching Mr. Richie with another woman and kicking him in what newspapers referred to, perhaps politely, as the \u201cstomach area.\u201d\n\nBy the end of his most successful decade, Mr. Richie found himself at home in Tuskegee, living in his childhood bedroom. When he was at his lowest, a family friend dropped by, saying he\u2019d brought some inspirational music.\n\n\u201cAnd he brought my albums by,\u201d Mr. Richie said. \u201cHe\u2019d labeled which songs to listen to. He said, \u2018Be sure to listen to the lyrics.\u2019 He gave me my music back.\u201d\n\nSo Mr. Richie sat in his old bedroom, where he\u2019d spent many nights grooving to Jimi Hendrix\u2019s \u201cBand of Gypsys\u201d under black light, and listened to his own songs, the ones that had touched so many and brought them so much joy, so much comfort. He sat and cried and found the strength to go on.\n\nHe owns that house now, along with much of the land around it. Someday he wants to turn that land into a beautiful garden. And in that garden he intends to build another little house, where he\u2019ll keep all his memorabilia and awards. A kind of Lionel Richie museum, which visitors to Tuskegee might add to their itineraries along with Booker T. Washington\u2019s house and the field where the Tuskegee Airmen learned to fly.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt may go without saying that the house he means to build in that garden in Tuskegee will be a brick house, but Lionel Richie says it anyway.\n\nPhoto\n\nMR. RICHIE MAY BE the only pop star who has counted both Nelson Mandela and Muammar el-Qaddafi among his die-hard fans. Of course, both of them are gone now. So, too, are many of the artists Mr. Richie thought of as his contemporaries, including Jackson, Prince and Whitney Houston. In the time that Mr. Richie has been a public figure \u2014 and a parent to children who are also navigating public lives \u2014 the very nature of celebrity has been transformed by social media.\n\nMr. Richie\u2019s youngest daughter, Sofia, has been romantically linked to Scott Disick, the estranged partner of Kourtney Kardashian. Over dessert, Mr. Richie considered how the hubbub around this liaison compares to the early 2000s, when his daughter, Nicole, had her own moment of infamy while joined at the hip to Paris Hilton.\n\nMr. Richie said there\u2019s no comparison. \u201cI\u2019m a veteran now,\u201d he said, \u201cbut Nicole was the Gulf War. Nicole and Paris were Vietnam for me. Because I had no experience. What\u2019s happening now with Sofie is leaps and bounds easier, because I know how to approach it. With Nicole, it was like being shot in the head every morning. Did she get arrested? For what? We didn\u2019t know what was coming next.\u201d\n\nHe laughed. To hear Mr. Richie describe it, fatherhood is a job not unlike being the elder-statesman judge on \u201cAmerican Idol.\u201d You\u2019re there to provide an example of constancy in an ever-changing world. The fact of your presence serves as a lesson unto itself.\n\n\u201cThere are moments where life should have scared me,\u201d Mr. Richie said, \u201cbut it didn\u2019t. Why? Because I was 19 and my parents were the mountain. And I get it now. You know, one day I pulled out of that driveway with the Commodores, in a van with five guys with Afros the size of Kentucky. There was no Instagram, no nothing. They didn\u2019t know where we were until I called them again. I\u2019m sure it was not what they wanted. But I give them all the props in the world, because they faked it very well.\u201d", "keywords": ["know", "mr", "idol", "lionel", "american", "tuskegee", "commodores", "hed", "richie", "teach", "wants", "house", "real", "night"], "polarity": 0.1844574979114453, "subjectivity": 0.4648626775271511},

LaGuardia High School, another specialized school, admits students by audition and a review of academic records. The schools have long been criticized for not being representative of the overall population of the city\u2019s school system, which is 67 percent black and Latino.\n\nIn his first mayoral campaign, Mr. de Blasio pledged to overhaul the schools\u2019 admissions process, moving to a system that took into account multiple criteria. But, since being elected, he has not made any significant effort to do that. (Changing the admissions process for the three original schools, Stuyvesant High School, the Bronx High School of Science and Brooklyn Tech, would require state legislation, which he has not pushed for.)\n\nInstead, the city has taken more modest steps, including expanding a free after-school test-preparation program and offering the admissions test during the school day at some middle schools that historically have not sent many students to the specialized schools. In the fall, the city revamped the exam, scrapping a section in which students had to take paragraphs with sentences that had been scrambled and reassemble them. The education department said the changes would make the test more equitable by better reflecting what students actually learn in school.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

There is no nullification, there is no secession. Federal law is the supreme law of the land,\u201d said Mr. Sessions, one of the administration\u2019s most adamant immigration restrictionists. He accused the state of intentionally using \u201cevery power the legislature has to undermine the duly established immigration laws of America.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit, which the Justice Department disclosed on Tuesday in advance of Mr. Sessions\u2019s speech, capped a clash between the Trump administration and California that has lasted more than a year, with each side reaping political profit from the battle. The administration has sought to demonstrate that it will not tolerate noncompliance with federal immigration enforcement; California\u2019s top officials, professed leaders of the anti-Trump resistance, have pushed the state to cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement as little as possible.\n\nPhoto\n\nEven as Mr. Sessions spoke, that opposition was making itself heard. Outside the hotel where Mr. Sessions was speaking, several hundred protesters marched, holding signs saying \u201cGo Home Jeff\u201d and \u201cCrush ICE\u201d and chanting, \u201cWhat do we want? Sessions out!\u201d\n\nShortly after Mr. Sessions\u2019s speech, Mr. Brown and the state\u2019s attorney general, Xavier Becerra, both Democrats, appeared together in the Capitol to denounce the lawsuit.\n\n\u201cCalifornia is in the business of public safety,\u201d Mr. Becerra said. \u201cWe are not in the business of deportation.\u201d\n\nThe suit, filed on Tuesday evening in Federal District Court in Sacramento, is the first Mr. Sessions\u2019s Justice Department has filed against a local or state government over its immigration policies.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt targets three state laws passed in recent months: one that limits state and local agencies\u2019 ability to share information about criminals or suspects with federal immigration officers, unless they have been convicted of serious crimes; a second that prohibits local businesses from allowing ICE to examine employee records without a court order or a subpoena; and a third that gave California officials more oversight over the state\u2019s immigration detention centers.\n\nMr. Brown and Mr. Becerra defended the legislation as constitutional on Wednesday, saying that the laws prevented neither ICE agents from working in local jails and prisons nor employers from cooperating with ICE. The employee records law, Mr. Becerra said, simply ensures that workers and employers are guaranteed \u201ctheir rights and their privacy and that those are being respected.\u201d\n\nAsked whether the law would, in effect, require warning undocumented workers to flee ahead of an ICE visit, Mr. Brown compared the provision to the practice of notifying criminal suspects that they have a right to a lawyer. \u201cWe are just following the law, and the law allows people to be advised of their rights,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cAnything else smacks of a more totalitarian approach to things.\u201d\n\nMr. Sessions had another comparison in mind.\n\nWhat if, he asked, a state enacted legislation hampering the work of employees from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration or the Environmental Protection Agency? \u201cWould you pass a law to do that?\u201d he said.\n\nBeyond the specifics of the laws, Mr. Sessions railed about several instances in which he said state officials had frustrated the work of federal law enforcement. He heartily ripped into Libby Schaaf, the Democratic mayor of Oakland, for issuing a warning last week that ICE planned to arrest immigrants across Northern California, an alert that infuriated agency officials who said her tip-off had allowed hundreds of their targets to slip away.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

But there are many other officials across the country who say they would prefer to work with ICE if the legal issues surrounding such cooperation are clarified, and some who are eager to help the federal government outright with immigration enforcement.\n\nThose tensions were palpable at Mr. Sessions\u2019s speech, which was hosted by the California Peace Officers Association, a law enforcement advocacy group. The crowd responded to the speech with brief applause; about 10 of the more than 200 officers in the room stood to clap.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m stuck in the middle,\u201d said Deputy Chief Derek Williams of the police department in Ontario, a midsize city east of Los Angeles with a large Hispanic population. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely bifurcated now.\u201d\n\nWhile the new state laws do not affect his work on a day-to-day basis, he said, the sharp increase in ICE activity has fostered \u201ca lack of trust with law enforcement\u201d among immigrant residents. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult time for us,\u201d he said.\n\nAmong those who endorsed Mr. Sessions\u2019s message was Paul R. Curry, a lobbyist for the California Correctional Supervisors Organization, which represents supervisors in the state prison system. He said California police chiefs were often caught between ICE\u2019s requests and the orders of their mayors, who might embrace sanctuary policies.\n\n\u201cEvery police officer is sworn to uphold the law not only of the state but the nation,\u201d Mr. Curry said. \u201cThe progressive agenda is running afoul of the force of our laws in the country.\u201d", "keywords": ["scolds", "jeff", "speech", "mr", "state", "laws", "ice", "enforcement", "sessions", "federal", "immigration", "law", "california", "problem"], "polarity": 0.0743163526614231, "subjectivity": 0.3816108773855252},

I suspect some variant of this experience is common among readers who grew up any time since 1962, when Madeleine L\u2019Engle\u2019s beloved science-fiction coming-of-age novel was first published.\n\nThe movie adaptation, directed by Ava DuVernay from a screenplay by Jennifer Lee and Jeff Stockwell, has been a long time coming, and it arrives in theaters buoyed by and burdened with expectations. It is the first $100 million movie directed by an African-American woman, and the diversity of its cast is both a welcome innovation and the declaration of a new norm. This is how movies should look from now on, which is to say how they should have looked all along.

This is, unapologetically, a children\u2019s movie, by turns gentle, thrilling and didactic, but missing the extra dimension of terror and wonder that would have transcended the genre. Thankfully, though, Ms. DuVernay has dispensed with the winking and cutesiness that are Hollywood\u2019s preferred ways of pandering and condescending to grown-ups. The best way to appreciate what she has done is in the company of a curious and eager 10-year-old (as I was fortunate enough to do).

In issues of \u201cJungle Action,\u201d though, Mr. McGregor and the artist Rich Buckler began to expand the mythos of the Black Panther\u2019s homeland, Wakanda, and created the character of Erik Killmonger. After a handful of issues, Graham became the artist.\n\n\u201cBilly was the main artist on that first major Black Panther series,\u201d said Mr. Simmons, who helped out when Mr. McGregor was designing maps of Wakanda. \u201cAnd it ruffled a few feathers and there was a point where some of the editors said, \u2018Where are the white people?\u2019 And Don, this little short Scottish white dude from Rhode Island said, \u2018We\u2019re in Africa, we\u2019re in his kingdom!\u2019\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nTheir run on \u201cJungle Action\u201d lasted until 1976, at which point Graham left Marvel, and the radar of comic book readers.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like Marvel was his whole life,\u201d Mr. Simmons said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t let go of who he was and where he was from in order to be accepted in another world. He was already on to something else.\u201d\n\nIn a sense, Graham\u2019s Black Panther contributions were just one chapter in his larger body of work exploring his heritage. He wrote heavily researched historical plays about the tap dance master Bill \u201cBojangles\u201d Robinson and Graham\u2019s uncle Paul, a one-pocket billiards champion better known as Detroit Slim. Other subjects included street magicians, griots and the radical group Move\u2019s standoff with authorities in Philadelphia.\n\nGraham won awards for his set designs; his plays were produced around the country. And so in the theater world, it was comic books that were the footnote. Billy Mitchell, who acted in some of Graham\u2019s plays, remembers seeing the Black Panther and Luke Cage illustrations hanging on the walls of his apartment.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen Graham would tell him he worked at Marvel Comics, Mr. Mitchell found it strange: \u201cHow many cats you know from Harlem were working for comic books?\u201d asked Mr. Mitchell, the official historian of the Apollo Theater, where Graham also performed stand-up and M.C.\u2019d performances by the Spinners and the O\u2019Jays.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Credit VSF\n\nBalkrishna Doshi doesn\u2019t talk just about his buildings. This architect, urban planner and educator talks about how his buildings aim to foster a sense of community, how space can promote inner peace, how cities can contribute to the health of a society.\n\nConsidered a pioneer of low-cost housing, Mr. Doshi, 90, is thrilled to have been awarded the 2018 Pritzker Prize, architecture\u2019s highest honor, which was announced on Wednesday. He is the first laureate from India, and worked with the 20th-century masters Le Corbusier and Louis Kahn.\n\n\u201cIt is a very wonderful thing that happened,\u201d he said in a recent telephone interview from his home in Ahmedabad, a city that was once the center of the nonviolent struggle for Indian independence. The award will be bestowed on Mr. Doshi, the 45th laureate, at the Aga Khan Museum in Toronto in May.\n\nBut Mr. Doshi\u2019s 70-year career has always been about much more than prizes \u2014 of which he nevertheless has many \u2014 or international renown, of which he had relatively little, given that he is not a household name.\n\nImage Rendering of Aranya, a low-cost housing complex of houses, courtyards and pathways that aims to empower \u201cthe have-nots to realize their dreams through ownership,\u201d Mr. Doshi said, \u201cimproving their quality of personal and community life.\u201d Credit VSF\n\nMr. Doshi has been consumed with larger issues like social good and sustainability. And he bemoans a culture and profession that he sees as overly concerned with the bottom line. \u201cOne is all the time looking at financial returns \u2014 that is not only what life is,\u201d he said. \u201cI think wellness is missing.\u201d\n\nWhat Mr. Doshi means by \u201cwellness,\u201d he said, are considerations like how we can \u201cconnect with silence\u201d; how \u201clife can be lived at your own pace\u201d; and \u201chow do we avoid the use of an automobile.\u201d\n\nThe architect has brought this type of philosophical thinking to projects like his Aranya Low Cost Housing in Indore (1989), where more than 80,000 low- and middle-income residents now live in homes ranging from modest one-room units to spacious houses, with shared courtyards for families.\n\nHe also designed mixed-income housing for a life insurance corporation in Ahmedabad (1973), which combines income groups on three floors of a pyramidal housing block approached through a common staircase. The Vidhyadhar Nagar Master Plan and Urban Design in Jaipur (1984) features channels for both water harvesting and distribution. (The Vidhyadhar housing plan recalled Mr. Doshi\u2019s work with Le Corbusier in Chandigarh, with its wide central avenues, and a study of Jaipur\u2019s Old City.)\n\n\u201cHousing as shelter is but one aspect of these projects,\u201d the Pritzker jury said in its citation. \u201cThe entire planning of the community, the scale, the creation of public, semipublic and private spaces are a testament to his understanding of how cities work and the importance of the urban design.\u201d\n\nMr. Doshi\u2019s emphasis on communal spaces is reflected in his own work studio, Sangath (roughly translated as \u201cmoving together\u201d), which includes a garden and outdoor amphitheater, spaces designed to foster the exchange of ideas. The mosaic tile in his studio also appears in the undulating roof of Mr. Doshi\u2019s underground art gallery in Ahmedabad, Amdavad ni Gufa (1994), which features the artwork of Maqbool Fida Husain.\n\nImage The undulating underground art gallery Amdavad ni Gufa in Ahmedabad (1994) features the work of Maqbool Fida Husain.

The architect said he has founded six schools, including the School of Architecture and Planning in Ahmedabad (1966-2012), where he is the dean emeritus. It was renamed CEPT University in 2002.\n\nHis educational buildings include the Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore (1977-92), a series of interwoven streets, courts and classrooms inspired by traditional, mazelike temple cities in southern India.\n\nBorn in Pune, India, in 1927, Mr. Doshi began his architecture studies in 1947 at the Sir JJ School of Architecture in Mumbai. He then moved to London and to Le Corbusier\u2019s atelier in Paris, where in the 1950s he helped work on Chandigarh, the experimental Modernist city about 150 miles north of New Delhi. Mr. Doshi ultimately settled in Ahmedabad, where he helped supervise the construction of Le Corbusier\u2019s Mill Owners\u2019 Association Building (1954) and worked on other Corbusier projects, including the Sarabhai House in Ahmedabad (1955).\n\nIn 1956, Mr. Doshi founded his own practice, Vastushilpa \u2014 now Vastushilpa Consultants \u2014 which has five partners and 60 employees.\n\nThe firm\u2019s more than 100 projects include the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad (1962), on which Mr. Doshi worked as an associate for Louis Kahn \u2014 an occasional collaboration that lasted more than a decade.\n\nHis work is deeply evocative of Indian history and culture, drawing on the grandeur of shrines and temples, the bustle of city streets and the local materials from his grandfather\u2019s furniture workshop.\n\nImage The Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore (1977-92), inspired by traditional Indian cities and temples, integrates \u201cnature as well as human activities,\u201d Mr. Doshi said. Credit VSF\n\nHe does not set out to design an iconic structure. Rather, Mr. Doshi approaches his projects with an eye toward seeding miniature societies that its residents can expand and animate over time.\n\n\u201cArchitecture is not a static building \u2014 it\u2019s a living organism,\u201d he said. \u201cHow do we add on coffee shops, restaurants, bookshops, so you can use the building? Can we bring life into what we create?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is the role of an architect today?\u201d Mr. Doshi added. \u201cAre we going to be a service provider working for a client, or are we going to be useful to the society at large?\u201d\n\nImage Formerly known as the Center for Environmental Planning and Technology, now CEPT University, in Ahmedabad, India.
