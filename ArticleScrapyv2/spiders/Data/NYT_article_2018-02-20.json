I\u2019ll never tire of their skill \u2014 their consummate speed and control \u2014 but this year, as they swept across the ice with gaping mouths to music from the \u201cMoulin Rouge\u201d soundtrack, they ran my red light.\n\nIt\u2019s true that skating isn\u2019t pure dance. It is, though, extraordinary in its own right and can possess the quiet sophistication, musicality and nuance of dance. With Ms. Papadakis and Mr. Cizeron, skating has room to grow. They aren\u2019t merely ice dancers: T hey dance on the ice, showing how it\u2019s capable of becoming a living canvas, one that curves toward the skater as the skater curves back into it.\n\nIn ice dance, there are no lifts above the head, no heroic jumps. Its power is rooted in a blade\u2019s deep etchings, the angle of plush knee bends and, despite those awkward boots, toes that point and extend the length of a leg to create fluent line. Arms lengthen from the back with fingers that grow along with them. If, in pairs and singles skating, it seems like the air is increasingly being sucked out of routines to make room for more jumps \u2014 it\u2019s worse when they\u2019re crammed into the second half in order to score more points \u2014 ice dance pushes skating to a more poetic place.\n\nPhoto\n\nHow can skaters bring emotion to a blade? How does their musicality play into a seemingly simple essence of motion? A skater moves forward and backward on the inside or outside edge of a blade. In ice dance, this is not rushed but emphasized in strokes that lean and bend to propel a skater from one side of the rink to the other.\n\nIn the singles and pairs world, pristine edges can be forsaken for jumps and lifts, but one skater who pays attention to the details in between is the American Adam Rippon. He has become a media sensation for his outspokenness, but what I love most about him is his skating. He moves like silk. He cares about line; his spins have an endearing lightness, as the arch of his back in his layback \u2014 arguably the most beautiful spin in skating \u2014 attests.\n\nHe skates for himself, the same way Ms. Papadakis and Mr. Cizeron skate \u2014 as if they are in their own world. When I watch them, my mind goes to a Jerome Robbins quote about \u201cDances at a Gathering,\u201d his sublime 1969 ensemble ballet. \u201cYou should never dance anything for the audience,\u201d he said. \u201cIt ruins it if you do. You should dance only to each other. As if the audience weren\u2019t there. It\u2019s very hard.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

But in their free skate program, set to Beethoven\u2019s \u201cMoonlight\u201d Sonata, Ms. Papadakis and Mr. Cizeron expanded the idea of virtuosity with the way they completely tuned in to each other. Often in ice dancing, you keep your eye on the woman; the man, as in the case of Mr. Moir, is there, in part, to show off the woman \u2014 to spark her fire.\n\nBut the lyrical and musical Ms. Papadakis and Mr. Cizeron are more of a slow boil. Moving as one, they are gossamer as they transform the ice into air. Their free dance unfurled gradually and hypnotically, building to feverish spin sequences. One, in which Mr. Cizeron rotated in a sit spin while holding Ms. Papadakis\u2019s extended leg as she opened her right shoulder and head to the ceiling, was a spectacle of position and daring.\n\nAs soon as the piano became subdued and dreamy, their flurry of footwork returned to the quiet hush of the start. As they glided across the ice in whispering strokes, it seemed as if they were no longer skating in an arena, but on a pond. In that moment, at once bracing and luminous, the Olympics turned from being a competition into a performance. This year the silver was the gold.", "keywords": ["skating", "skater", "french", "mr", "cizeron", "papadakis", "jumps", "ice", "ballet", "ms", "spin", "dancers", "dance", "olympic", "ethereal"], "polarity": 0.13311067347952596, "subjectivity": 0.4708457526080475},

Her triple loop was fine, but the fall will really hurt her chances of a good score and high finish.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But she looked sharp in the team event, earlier in the Games, getting comfortably the top score in the short program. She will skate to a Chopin nocturne.\n\n\u2022 Her main threat could be her countrywoman, Alina Zagitova, who beat her at the European championships. Zagitova is a double-take worthy 15 years old. At the team event, she was chosen for the free skate and crushed the field, miles ahead of the heralded performance of Mirai Nagasu of the United States.

So while other athletes qualified ahead of Swaney, she was able to ski for Hungary thanks to that quota system and a dearth of other athletes from countries that had not already sent four competitors to the event.\n\nPhilippe Belanger, the head judge of freeskiing competitions at the Pyeongchang Olympics, told The Denver Post that the International Ski Federation was considering proposals that would decrease the number of competitive slots available for Olympic competitors in the halfpipe, which would make it more difficult for athletes like Swaney to qualify.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Swaney, who is based in the Bay Area, has been working toward her Olympic dream for most of her life. Inspired by Kristi Yamaguchi\u2019s gold medal performance in the 1992 Olympic Games, Swaney skated from her childhood until her second year of college. (Her father signed her up for a 30-minute weekly lesson. She did not realize until years later that figure skaters trained six or seven days a week.)\n\nFor two years at the University of California, Berkeley, she was the coxswain \u2014 the person who directs the crew from the stern of the boat \u2014 for the nationally competitive men\u2019s rowing team.\n\nHer experience steering a crew team led her to believe that she might be able to steer a bobsled. The United States women\u2019s bobsled team told her that she was too small to be a bobsledder, but that it was impressed by her athletic background. She eventually took up skeleton \u2014 a headfirst version of luge.\n\nShe began skiing in 2010, after attending the Vancouver Olympics and feeling inspired by the skiers, and doubled down on the event after giving up skeleton. For six years, training in Utah, she would often wake up at 6:30 a.m. to go the gym, then ski for hours. She fit in training around two part-time jobs.\n\nStill, she did not know that she would be heading to South Korea until Jan. 24, when she learned she had qualified. She arrived in Budapest at midnight on the 25th, having brought only her passport, her jacket and the bag she had brought to work that day.\n\nShe said there was some attention she was grateful for: the supportive texts she received from her parents after the event.\n\n\u201cMy dad told me he found my runs really graceful, so I was happy to hear that,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re not as familiar with skiing as they are with other sports, but they were happy to see me compete.\u201d", "keywords": ["halfpipe", "skiers", "athletes", "heart", "competitors", "ski", "york", "viral", "swaney", "womens", "told", "elizabeth", "olympic", "skier"], "polarity": 0.16708548903670856, "subjectivity": 0.4607521205082182},

The federation would purchase a fleet of standardized sleds, making bobsled a contest of strength and driving skill rather than an arms race for the best and most expensive engineering.\n\nThe federation is also considering providing sleds in a variety of sizes \u2014 including four-man sleds \u2014 to athletes to help increase participation, with the goal of attracting more female drivers and more nations to participate.\n\nHowever, the International Olympic Committee still needs to support expanding the women\u2019s competition, Van Wees said.

The seeds of the current crisis in American women\u2019s skating were planted long ago, not at the highest levels of the sport, but at the lowest.\n\nWhen the rules of judging skating in international competition changed in 2004, with the goal of making judging more transparent, one of the consequences was the rewarding of skaters who attempt more challenging technical elements in the pursuit of ever more points. But though the international rules changed judging at the junior and senior levels, it was up to each individual country to determine how it judged the lower level competitions. And in the American system, the juvenile through novice competitions did not change to keep up.\n\nYoung skaters in the United States were rewarded not for innovating and taking risks \u2014 attempting new combos, for instance, or trying more difficult jumps \u2014 but for skating cleanly. Skating, like all other sports, has an element of strategy; what followed was a generation of young women who went home after competitions, rethought their programs, took out those triple-triples \u2014 and found they could still win.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

She and her teammate Alina Zagitova have begun raising their arms over their head during their jumps \u2014 another element that nabs them extra difficulty points, all of which add up.\n\nMs. Zagitova, for her part, has put together a program designed to best take advantage of the scoring system: The spins and choreography sequence come in the first half of the skate, and the jumps come in the second, where they receive a 10 percent bonus because they are executed on tired legs.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe American men have avoided the fate of the women thanks largely to the one-man phenom Nathan Chen, whose physicality and technical brilliance have helped push his teammates forward, too. Despite a disappointing short program this Olympics, Mr. Chen came back to win the free skate portion of the competition, setting a record for technical score in a Winter Olympic Games, and becoming the first man to successfully land five quads in competition and to attempt six.\n\nHappily, a course correction has begun. After the Sochi Games, the United States implemented a new judging system for skaters in lower levels intended to reward risk-taking and consistency. These sorts of changes won\u2019t produce champions immediately, but we could see a real difference in the caliber of skaters in the Winter Olympics in Beijing in 2022.\n\nThe selection of this year\u2019s Olympic team is also a great sign. The United States is being represented by women like Ms. Nagasu, whose success with the notorious triple axel last week was a genuine American milestone, and Bradie Tennell, a virtual unknown until a few months ago but one who lands difficult triple-triple combinations, with ease and consistency.\n\nNeither is likely to match the prowess of the Russians, but their selection sends a clear message from the highest level of United States skating to the next generation: Risks bring rewards.\n\nTake it from someone who was once criticized for focusing too much on technical skating \u2014 they\u2019re right.", "keywords": ["technical", "skating", "skaters", "system", "lipinski", "risks", "judging", "rink", "tara", "states", "american", "sign", "women", "united"], "polarity": 0.16001348892653247, "subjectivity": 0.3916506681724074},

It could be an unparalleled matchup with historic implications: the only time in any Olympics that Vonn and Shiffrin, two of skiing\u2019s greatest racers, are likely to be pitted against each other in the same event.\n\nVonn, who has the most World Cup victories by a woman (81), is closing in on Ingemar Stenmark\u2019s record of 86 World Cup wins. Vonn, 33, expects to retire after the 2018-19 season.\n\nShiffrin, 22, already has 41 World Cup victories, a stunning pace. But if she remains reasonably healthy, she could vault past both Vonn and Stenmark, and smash records for Olympic victories, too. Shiffrin already has two gold medals. Vonn, competing in her fourth Olympics, has only one.\n\nBut if ski-racing fans want to see them square off in a championship race setting, this week may be their last, best chance to do so. Vonn and Shiffrin most likely will meet only a few more times next winter on the World Cup circuit. Since Shiffrin debuted on the World Cup in 2011, they have competed against each other in only a handful of races.\n\nNonetheless, especially in the last couple of years, they have had a tacit rivalry even as they have existed in separate orbits.\n\nVonn has been battered by injuries in recent years, and in an effort to stay healthy for the Pyeongchang Games she has raced almost exclusively in her best events, like the speedy downhill.\n\nPhoto\n\nShiffrin has instead been racking up victories in the safer, more technical, Alpine events, like slalom and giant slalom, which are much different than the risky events Vonn prefers. It\u2019s a schedule that has kept Vonn and Shiffrin, who live about a dozen miles apart outside Vail, Colo., on different paths.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe two skiers, however, share some sponsors and sometimes even make appearances together, occasions when they are amiable and deferential. There are also brief periods when the United States ski team has training sessions that bring Vonn and Shiffrin together.\n\nBut otherwise they have kept their distance, and Vonn has probably grown weary of hearing the ski community calling Shiffrin \u201cthe next Lindsey Vonn,\u201d something that first happened in 2010, not long after Vonn became the first American woman to win the Olympic downhill, at the Vancouver Olympics.\n\nOn Monday morning at the Jeongseon Alpine Center, Vonn and Shiffrin, who won the Olympic giant slalom last week, both took training runs in preparation for the women\u2019s downhill.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story 2018 Olympics Newsletter For 19 days, our Sports newsletter will be all things Olympics.

The favorite in a downhill sometimes purposely slows down in the final seconds of training to keep the competition guessing about just how fast a time might have been possible. Vonn finished third in the field Monday. She won the first training run on Sunday.\n\nShiffrin, on the other hand, was still showing signs of her inexperience on a high-level downhill course. Her body language and the amount of forward pressure she was exerting on her skis made it clear that she was thinking her way through her run. She was graceful, efficient and smoothly glided across the icy track of snow, but she also was not entirely certain where to seek more speed and where to be wary. She finished a respectable 16th on Monday, which was seven spots higher than she did in the first training run. The final training runs will be Tuesday, but now only Vonn will be there.\n\nThe apparent differences between Vonn and Shiffrin continued after they had left the snow on Monday. Shortly after her run, Shiffrin did a brief interview with NBC but otherwise did not speak with reporters. She was on her way to slalom training Monday afternoon to get ready for the Alpine combined.\n\nVonn, who will enter Wednesday\u2019s race as a co-favorite with Italy\u2019s Sofia Goggia, watched the entire training session from a spot near the finish area, laughing and joking with her rivals.

And no rinks have two ice-resurfacing machines. Multiple Zambonis on the ice simultaneously can be a seductive dance to watch, but terrifying to drive.\n\nThere were other limiting factors in securing local talent. Some could not get the six or eight weeks off that the job required. And without firm post-Olympic plans for several venues (the speedskating oval, for example, is likely to be converted to convention space), there was little opportunity for locals to find lasting employment by learning during the Olympics and taking over the ice-making operation afterward, as happened in places like Vancouver and Salt Lake City.\n\nMoffatt used an all-Korean crew during hockey test events here last year, with the idea he might do the same during the Olympics. He discovered that younger Korean drivers deferred to older drivers, afraid to disrespectfully show them up with their skills.

Most of those at the hockey venues work at N.H.L. arenas in places like Edmonton, St. Paul and Denver. At the figure skating and short-track speedskating sites, most drivers work smaller arenas or oversee the ice operations at recreation centers. Those at the long-track oval have specific experience in ovals, which require a more pristine sheet of ice.\n\n\u201cIt has to be absolutely perfect,\u201d said Paul Golomski, whose job at home is facility director of Pettit National Ice Center in Milwaukee. \u201cThickness is critical. The amount of speed they\u2019re carrying, the ice has to be perfectly flat.\u201d\n\nEvery ice sport demands a different surface, with variations in thickness, temperature and hardness. At Gangneung Ice Arena, Boehler split his crew between figure skating and short-track specialists. Figure skating requires thicker, softer ice.

", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/18/sports/olympics/figure-skating-nbc-scott-hamilton-.html", "text": "Hamilton laughed off my assumptions.\n\nIn the past 21 years, he has faced Stage 4 testicular cancer, followed by three brain tumors \u2014 one every six years since 2004. He\u2019s living with a brain tumor right now.\n\nSo in the fall of 2014, when Hamilton reached out to Jim Bell, NBC\u2019s president of Olympics production and programming, to find out if he would be working on Skate America that October, Bell called him back to break the news. NBC valued him and adored him, Hamilton recalled Bell saying, and the network appreciated all his years at the top. But it was time for a change.\n\n\u201cThere was a sadness for about 10 minutes,\u201d Hamilton said last week at the Olympic figure skating arena. \u201cI lamented it being over. I thought, \u2018Oh, man, that was such a beautiful part of my life and now it\u2019s over.\u2019 But change happens to everyone \u2014 even me.\u201d\n\nHamilton gets it. Something like this happens to even the best of us \u2014 eventually \u2014 right? Corporate America decided that his shelf life had expired. There was nothing he could do about it.\n\nBesides, after he had spent so many years just trying to stay healthy \u2014 and alive \u2014 how could being replaced by the next big thing really matter? In his heart, Hamilton knew it did not. He would bounce back, almost out of habit.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI calculated once how many times I fell during my skating career \u2014 41,600 times,\u201d he said. \u201cBut here\u2019s the funny thing: I got up 41,600 times. That\u2019s the muscle you have to build in your psyche \u2014 the one that reminds you to just get up.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLooking ahead, Hamilton knew there was so much more to worry about and, in the end, so much he decided not to worry about.\n\nAfter overcoming testicular cancer in 1997, he learned that he had a pituitary tumor in 2004, one that had wrapped itself around his optic nerve. The tumor was benign, but it threatened to grow in ways that dangerously crowded his brain.\n\nHamilton said he had prayed about 12 times a day for it to go away. Doctors treated him with radiation, and the tumor did go away.\n\nIn 2010, it reappeared. Surgery caused an aneurysm that temporarily blinded him in one eye.\n\nHamilton said he would never forget what his wife, Tracie, said to him during a pep talk: \u201cJoy is not the lack of suffering or fear, it\u2019s how you choose to handle the suffering and fear.\u201d It finally hit him that it was true.\n\nSo when the tumor returned for an encore in 2016, Hamilton decided to react differently. There was no \u201cwhy me?\u201d anymore.\n\n\u201cI figured I needed to go through this with joy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was just a muscle I needed to build, like the muscles I built skating.\u201d\n\nWhen one of his four children asked about the tumor, Hamilton said: \u201cYep, it\u2019s back. It\u2019s fine, it\u2019s fine, it\u2019s really fine.\u201d\n\nFine \u2014 but also time to fight back in a new way. There was no chance to undergo radiation treatment again. It would only have fried his brain, he said. The tumor was still relatively small, so Hamilton didn\u2019t need to rush into surgery. He tried to tackle the problem differently: He stopped eating sugar, red meat and other things he considered bad for his body. He started eating organic food and drinking only coffee or water with high pH. He hit the treadmill and the weight room.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen Hamilton went back to the doctor several months later, he learned that his tumor hadn\u2019t grown. During his next checkup, he heard even better news.\n\nThe tumor had shrunk, by about half. Hamilton choked up when describing what happened next.\n\n\u201cHave you ever had one shrink without treatment before?\u201d he said he asked the doctor. \u201cAnd the doctor said, \u2018Nope, never.\u2019\u201d\n\nHamilton asked, \u201cSo how can you explain this?\u201d\n\nThe doctor said, \u201cGod.\u201d\n\nIt floored him. He was in the process of losing three friends to colon cancer, yet he, somehow, someway, was given this miracle? At his latest doctor\u2019s visit, in December, the tumor was even smaller.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story 2018 Olympics Newsletter For 19 days, our Sports newsletter will be all things Olympics.

There\u2019s something that I need to be doing. I just have to figure out what that is.\u201d\n\nDuring the figure skating events last week, Hamilton stood on a riser just above Lipinski, Weir and Terry Gannon, the third member of the main broadcasting team. Hamilton couldn\u2019t miss them when the lights came on and they were on center stage, just as he used to be. He looked on, often peeking at them over his reading glasses. But he said the change hadn\u2019t been awkward, and Lipinski echoed that.\n\n\u201cWhen I first started as a commentator, I listened to all of Scott\u2019s tapes and learned so much because he was so incredible,\u201d said Lipinski, who won the Olympic gold medal in 1998. \u201cHe called my Olympics and was like a big brother to me when we toured together. He\u2019s been a mentor and, of course, he was at my wedding last summer. I think this whole thing is just a natural progression for us.\u201d\n\nShe said he was still involved in the broadcast \u201cin a big way\u201d because he brings something unique \u2014 and that\u2019s Scott Hamilton being Scott Hamilton.\n\n\u201cHe has such enthusiasm for the sport,\u201d she said.\n\nHe\u2019s a legend in skating arenas. So much so that Maxim Trankov, half of the Russian pairs team that won gold in 2014, stopped Hamilton on Wednesday and asked him to pose for a selfie.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cOh, wow, thank you so much,\u201d Trankov said. \u201cI watched you skate all the time when I was a kid. You\u2019re amazing.\u201d\n\nHamilton returned the compliment and told Trankov they should grab coffee sometime. He was gracious, as always.\n\n\u201cThere was a little apprehension coming to these Olympics because nobody likes change,\u201d he told me. \u201cBut I\u2019ve decided to make this fun because I\u2019m doing things joyfully.

Scores of athletes, coaches and officials tainted by the scandal have been barred, though the International Olympic Committee has been considering allowing the Russian athletes to march under their national flag and in their country\u2019s uniforms for the closing ceremony, which they were not permitted to do during the opening ceremony. The Olympic anthem will be played instead of Russia\u2019s national anthem for any winners of gold medals, although no Russians have won so far.\n\nThe failed test is likely to figure in the thinking of the three-person I.O.C. panel charged with deciding whether Russia\u2019s team could be reinstated for the closing ceremony and its athletes allowed to parade with the Russian flag.\n\nThe panel is also closely monitoring the reaction from Russian officials to the failed test. Should they dispute the verdict or make critical comments it would be practically impossible to restore the Russian team before the end of the Games, said a person familiar with the group\u2019s thinking. Complicating matters further is Russia\u2019s continued failure to pay a $15 million fine levied by the I.O.C. as a response to the doping scheme. The fine is nonnegotiable.\n\nThe Russians allowed to participate in South Korea were subjected to what Olympics officials described as a rigorous testing regimen, and have found themselves under scrutiny from testers as the event has progressed.\n\n\u201cOn the one hand it is extremely disappointing when prohibited substances might have been used, but on the other hand it shows the effectiveness of the antidoping system at the Games, which protects the rights of all the clean athletes,\u201d the International Olympic Committee said in a statement Sunday.\n\nMeldonium caused confusion among Russian athletes when it was added to the list of banned substances by the World Anti-Doping Agency. Scores of athletes, including the five-time Grand Slam tennis champion Maria Sharapova, tested positive for it.\n\nThe antidoping agency eventually ruled that more research was required to understand how long the substance, known as mildronate in Russia, remained in the system, as some athletes claimed they had consumed it before the ban had come into force.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nExperts have said it is possible that trace amounts of the substance would still be detectable for a few months after an athlete stopped taking it, but it is unlikely it would still be present if an athlete stopped taking the drug before the ban went into effect in January 2016.\n\nEastern European scientists have promoted meldonium\u2019s health benefits, saying it increases blood flow. Increased blood flow also provides more oxygen to muscles and could increase endurance. While curling is far from cross-country skiing in terms of exertion, curlers spend hours on their feet and vigorously sweep the ice at regular intervals.\n\nMany of the athletes involved, though not Sharapova, eventually had their suspensions lifted because it was not clear when they had taken the substance.\n\nKrushelnytsky was part of the mixed doubles team that won a bronze medal last week, a rare bright spot for the depleted Russian Olympic squad, which has struggled without some of its top stars.\n\nIn the curling event, he appeared to do most of the pair\u2019s sweeping. They defeated Kristin Skaslin and Magnus Nedregotten of Norway in the bronze medal match, 8-4.\n\nThe Russian team actually had a chance to win its semifinal against Switzerland, but Krushelnytsky overshot a target on his final shot of the match, and Switzerland advanced to the final, where it was defeated by Canada.", "keywords": ["officials", "failed", "athletes", "olympics", "team", "seoul", "ceremony", "newsletter", "russias", "antidoping", "leaves", "test", "doping", "athlete", "olympic", "russian"], "polarity": 0.10170068027210885, "subjectivity": 0.429675615389901},

I\u2019ll never tire of their skill \u2014 their consummate speed and control \u2014 but this year, as they swept across the ice with gaping mouths to music from the \u201cMoulin Rouge\u201d soundtrack, they ran my red light.\n\nIt\u2019s true that skating isn\u2019t pure dance. It is, though, extraordinary in its own right and can possess the quiet sophistication, musicality and nuance of dance. With Ms. Papadakis and Mr. Cizeron, skating has room to grow. They aren\u2019t merely ice dancers: T hey dance on the ice, showing how it\u2019s capable of becoming a living canvas, one that curves toward the skater as the skater curves back into it.\n\nIn ice dance, there are no lifts above the head, no heroic jumps. Its power is rooted in a blade\u2019s deep etchings, the angle of plush knee bends and, despite those awkward boots, toes that point and extend the length of a leg to create fluent line. Arms lengthen from the back with fingers that grow along with them. If, in pairs and singles skating, it seems like the air is increasingly being sucked out of routines to make room for more jumps \u2014 it\u2019s worse when they\u2019re crammed into the second half in order to score more points \u2014 ice dance pushes skating to a more poetic place.\n\nPhoto\n\nHow can skaters bring emotion to a blade? How does their musicality play into a seemingly simple essence of motion? A skater moves forward and backward on the inside or outside edge of a blade. In ice dance, this is not rushed but emphasized in strokes that lean and bend to propel a skater from one side of the rink to the other.\n\nIn the singles and pairs world, pristine edges can be forsaken for jumps and lifts, but one skater who pays attention to the details in between is the American Adam Rippon. He has become a media sensation for his outspokenness, but what I love most about him is his skating. He moves like silk. He cares about line; his spins have an endearing lightness, as the arch of his back in his layback \u2014 arguably the most beautiful spin in skating \u2014 attests.\n\nHe skates for himself, the same way Ms. Papadakis and Mr. Cizeron skate \u2014 as if they are in their own world. When I watch them, my mind goes to a Jerome Robbins quote about \u201cDances at a Gathering,\u201d his sublime 1969 ensemble ballet. \u201cYou should never dance anything for the audience,\u201d he said. \u201cIt ruins it if you do. You should dance only to each other. As if the audience weren\u2019t there. It\u2019s very hard.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

But in their free skate program, set to Beethoven\u2019s \u201cMoonlight\u201d Sonata, Ms. Papadakis and Mr. Cizeron expanded the idea of virtuosity with the way they completely tuned in to each other. Often in ice dancing, you keep your eye on the woman; the man, as in the case of Mr. Moir, is there, in part, to show off the woman \u2014 to spark her fire.\n\nBut the lyrical and musical Ms. Papadakis and Mr. Cizeron are more of a slow boil. Moving as one, they are gossamer as they transform the ice into air. Their free dance unfurled gradually and hypnotically, building to feverish spin sequences. One, in which Mr. Cizeron rotated in a sit spin while holding Ms. Papadakis\u2019s extended leg as she opened her right shoulder and head to the ceiling, was a spectacle of position and daring.\n\nAs soon as the piano became subdued and dreamy, their flurry of footwork returned to the quiet hush of the start. As they glided across the ice in whispering strokes, it seemed as if they were no longer skating in an arena, but on a pond. In that moment, at once bracing and luminous, the Olympics turned from being a competition into a performance.

She also did very well on subjective categories, like interpretation of the music and \u201cperformance,\u201d scoring 7\u2019s while her opponents got 6s and 5s.\n\nTennell had been a model of consistency this season, landing 31 of her 32 previous jumps flawlessly.

In the short program, the big requirements are a triple jump and a triple-triple combination. Tennell started with the combo, hitting the triple Lutz, but falling on the triple toeloop. Her triple loop was fine, but the fall will really hurt her chances of a good score and high finish.\n\n\u201cYou just have to get up and keep on going as if nothing happened,\u201d Tennell said. \u201cYou know, my left arm just got away from me and I just kind of sat down.\u201d\n\nTop Story Lines for the Short Program\n\n\u2022 If there is anything to concern Medvedeva\u2019s fans, it is that she broke her foot in November.

She will skate to a Chopin nocturne.\n\n\u2022 Her main threat could be her countrywoman, Alina Zagitova, who beat her at the European championships. Zagitova is a double-take worthy 15 years old. At the team event, she was chosen for the free skate and crushed the field, miles ahead of the heralded performance of Mirai Nagasu of the United States. She will skate to music from the film \u201cBlack Swan,\u201d which came out in 2010, when she was 8 years old.\n\n\u2022 With the one-two punch of Medvedeva and Zagitova, Russia could be looking at its first gold medal of the Games.\n\n\u2022 Other medal contenders include the 31-year-old veteran Carolina Kostner of Italy, who has been competing at the Olympics since 2006 and won a bronze four years ago, and Kaetlyn Osmond of Canada, the world silver medalist. Kostner and Osmond finished 2-3 behind Medvedeva in the team event short program.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u2022 The American who has received the most attention is Nagasu, a 2010 Olympian who was passed over for the team in 2014.

So while other athletes qualified ahead of Swaney, she was able to ski for Hungary thanks to that quota system and a dearth of other athletes from countries that had not already sent four competitors to the event.\n\nPhilippe Belanger, the head judge of freeskiing competitions at the Pyeongchang Olympics, told The Denver Post that the International Ski Federation was considering proposals that would decrease the number of competitive slots available for Olympic competitors in the halfpipe, which would make it more difficult for athletes like Swaney to qualify.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Swaney, who is based in the Bay Area, has been working toward her Olympic dream for most of her life. Inspired by Kristi Yamaguchi\u2019s gold medal performance in the 1992 Olympic Games, Swaney skated from her childhood until her second year of college. (Her father signed her up for a 30-minute weekly lesson. She did not realize until years later that figure skaters trained six or seven days a week.)\n\nFor two years at the University of California, Berkeley, she was the coxswain \u2014 the person who directs the crew from the stern of the boat \u2014 for the nationally competitive men\u2019s rowing team.\n\nHer experience steering a crew team led her to believe that she might be able to steer a bobsled. The United States women\u2019s bobsled team told her that she was too small to be a bobsledder, but that it was impressed by her athletic background. She eventually took up skeleton \u2014 a headfirst version of luge.\n\nShe began skiing in 2010, after attending the Vancouver Olympics and feeling inspired by the skiers, and doubled down on the event after giving up skeleton. For six years, training in Utah, she would often wake up at 6:30 a.m. to go the gym, then ski for hours. She fit in training around two part-time jobs.\n\nStill, she did not know that she would be heading to South Korea until Jan. 24, when she learned she had qualified. She arrived in Budapest at midnight on the 25th, having brought only her passport, her jacket and the bag she had brought to work that day.\n\nShe said there was some attention she was grateful for: the supportive texts she received from her parents after the event.\n\n\u201cMy dad told me he found my runs really graceful, so I was happy to hear that,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re not as familiar with skiing as they are with other sports, but they were happy to see me compete.\u201d", "keywords": ["halfpipe", "skiers", "athletes", "heart", "competitors", "ski", "york", "viral", "swaney", "womens", "told", "elizabeth", "olympic", "skier"], "polarity": 0.16708548903670856, "subjectivity": 0.4607521205082182},

The federation would purchase a fleet of standardized sleds, making bobsled a contest of strength and driving skill rather than an arms race for the best and most expensive engineering.\n\nThe federation is also considering providing sleds in a variety of sizes \u2014 including four-man sleds \u2014 to athletes to help increase participation, with the goal of attracting more female drivers and more nations to participate.\n\nHowever, the International Olympic Committee still needs to support expanding the women\u2019s competition, Van Wees said.

The seeds of the current crisis in American women\u2019s skating were planted long ago, not at the highest levels of the sport, but at the lowest.\n\nWhen the rules of judging skating in international competition changed in 2004, with the goal of making judging more transparent, one of the consequences was the rewarding of skaters who attempt more challenging technical elements in the pursuit of ever more points. But though the international rules changed judging at the junior and senior levels, it was up to each individual country to determine how it judged the lower level competitions. And in the American system, the juvenile through novice competitions did not change to keep up.\n\nYoung skaters in the United States were rewarded not for innovating and taking risks \u2014 attempting new combos, for instance, or trying more difficult jumps \u2014 but for skating cleanly. Skating, like all other sports, has an element of strategy; what followed was a generation of young women who went home after competitions, rethought their programs, took out those triple-triples \u2014 and found they could still win.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

She and her teammate Alina Zagitova have begun raising their arms over their head during their jumps \u2014 another element that nabs them extra difficulty points, all of which add up.\n\nMs. Zagitova, for her part, has put together a program designed to best take advantage of the scoring system: The spins and choreography sequence come in the first half of the skate, and the jumps come in the second, where they receive a 10 percent bonus because they are executed on tired legs.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe American men have avoided the fate of the women thanks largely to the one-man phenom Nathan Chen, whose physicality and technical brilliance have helped push his teammates forward, too. Despite a disappointing short program this Olympics, Mr. Chen came back to win the free skate portion of the competition, setting a record for technical score in a Winter Olympic Games, and becoming the first man to successfully land five quads in competition and to attempt six.\n\nHappily, a course correction has begun. After the Sochi Games, the United States implemented a new judging system for skaters in lower levels intended to reward risk-taking and consistency. These sorts of changes won\u2019t produce champions immediately, but we could see a real difference in the caliber of skaters in the Winter Olympics in Beijing in 2022.\n\nThe selection of this year\u2019s Olympic team is also a great sign. The United States is being represented by women like Ms. Nagasu, whose success with the notorious triple axel last week was a genuine American milestone, and Bradie Tennell, a virtual unknown until a few months ago but one who lands difficult triple-triple combinations, with ease and consistency.\n\nNeither is likely to match the prowess of the Russians, but their selection sends a clear message from the highest level of United States skating to the next generation: Risks bring rewards.\n\nTake it from someone who was once criticized for focusing too much on technical skating \u2014 they\u2019re right.", "keywords": ["technical", "skating", "skaters", "system", "lipinski", "risks", "judging", "rink", "tara", "states", "american", "sign", "women", "united"], "polarity": 0.16001348892653247, "subjectivity": 0.3916506681724074},

It could be an unparalleled matchup with historic implications: the only time in any Olympics that Vonn and Shiffrin, two of skiing\u2019s greatest racers, are likely to be pitted against each other in the same event.\n\nVonn, who has the most World Cup victories by a woman (81), is closing in on Ingemar Stenmark\u2019s record of 86 World Cup wins. Vonn, 33, expects to retire after the 2018-19 season.\n\nShiffrin, 22, already has 41 World Cup victories, a stunning pace.

The favorite in a downhill sometimes purposely slows down in the final seconds of training to keep the competition guessing about just how fast a time might have been possible. Vonn finished third in the field Monday. She won the first training run on Sunday.\n\nShiffrin, on the other hand, was still showing signs of her inexperience on a high-level downhill course. Her body language and the amount of forward pressure she was exerting on her skis made it clear that she was thinking her way through her run. She was graceful, efficient and smoothly glided across the icy track of snow, but she also was not entirely certain where to seek more speed and where to be wary. She finished a respectable 16th on Monday, which was seven spots higher than she did in the first training run. The final training runs will be Tuesday, but now only Vonn will be there.\n\nThe apparent differences between Vonn and Shiffrin continued after they had left the snow on Monday. Shortly after her run, Shiffrin did a brief interview with NBC but otherwise did not speak with reporters. She was on her way to slalom training Monday afternoon to get ready for the Alpine combined.\n\nVonn, who will enter Wednesday\u2019s race as a co-favorite with Italy\u2019s Sofia Goggia, watched the entire training session from a spot near the finish area, laughing and joking with her rivals.

Most of those at the hockey venues work at N.H.L. arenas in places like Edmonton, St. Paul and Denver. At the figure skating and short-track speedskating sites, most drivers work smaller arenas or oversee the ice operations at recreation centers. Those at the long-track oval have specific experience in ovals, which require a more pristine sheet of ice.\n\n\u201cIt has to be absolutely perfect,\u201d said Paul Golomski, whose job at home is facility director of Pettit National Ice Center in Milwaukee. \u201cThickness is critical. The amount of speed they\u2019re carrying, the ice has to be perfectly flat.\u201d\n\nEvery ice sport demands a different surface, with variations in thickness, temperature and hardness. At Gangneung Ice Arena, Boehler split his crew between figure skating and short-track specialists. Figure skating requires thicker, softer ice.

The sport, however, is not accustomed to being at the center of such a high-profile case, so the news sowed confusion and puzzlement among the curlers here.\n\n\u201cI was a bit shocked this morning,\u201d said Madeleine Dupont, the skip of the Danish women\u2019s team. \u201cI was like, \u2018That cannot be true.\u2019 But then again, people have been taking all sorts of stuff: natural medicine or lip balm or I don\u2019t know what.

But Alexander is not stupid. So sorry, I don\u2019t believe it.\u201d\n\nThe drug is thought to enhance endurance and would possibly play a role in curling by increasing the stamina of athletes, who must be accurate with their shots, sometimes down to the centimeter. Hard sweeping can take a toll over the course of a long match.

Curling also has a long tradition of opponents meeting for beers after a good, clean bonspiel (curling lingo for tournament).\n\nBut even before the doping case, curling had experienced its share of controversy here at the Olympics.\n\nLast week, Rachel Homan, the skip of the Canadian women\u2019s team, broke with etiquette by having a curling stone removed from competition when an opponent from Denmark accidentally touched it with her broom. After Denmark came back to win, Dupont, the team\u2019s skip, told a reporter from CBC Sports that it was \u201ckarma.\u201d Even some Canadian fans were bothered by Homan\u2019s decision.\n\nThen, on Sunday, an equipment malfunction appeared to cost the women\u2019s team from Britain in a loss to Sweden.

NBC valued him and adored him, Hamilton recalled Bell saying, and the network appreciated all his years at the top. But it was time for a change.\n\n\u201cThere was a sadness for about 10 minutes,\u201d Hamilton said last week at the Olympic figure skating arena. \u201cI lamented it being over.

The tumor was benign, but it threatened to grow in ways that dangerously crowded his brain.\n\nHamilton said he had prayed about 12 times a day for it to go away. Doctors treated him with radiation, and the tumor did go away.\n\nIn 2010, it reappeared. Surgery caused an aneurysm that temporarily blinded him in one eye.\n\nHamilton said he would never forget what his wife, Tracie, said to him during a pep talk: \u201cJoy is not the lack of suffering or fear, it\u2019s how you choose to handle the suffering and fear.\u201d It finally hit him that it was true.\n\nSo when the tumor returned for an encore in 2016, Hamilton decided to react differently. There was no \u201cwhy me?\u201d anymore.\n\n\u201cI figured I needed to go through this with joy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was just a muscle I needed to build, like the muscles I built skating.\u201d\n\nWhen one of his four children asked about the tumor, Hamilton said: \u201cYep, it\u2019s back. It\u2019s fine, it\u2019s fine, it\u2019s really fine.\u201d\n\nFine \u2014 but also time to fight back in a new way. There was no chance to undergo radiation treatment again. It would only have fried his brain, he said. The tumor was still relatively small, so Hamilton didn\u2019t need to rush into surgery. He tried to tackle the problem differently: He stopped eating sugar, red meat and other things he considered bad for his body. He started eating organic food and drinking only coffee or water with high pH. He hit the treadmill and the weight room.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen Hamilton went back to the doctor several months later, he learned that his tumor hadn\u2019t grown. During his next checkup, he heard even better news.\n\nThe tumor had shrunk, by about half.

Scores of athletes, coaches and officials tainted by the scandal have been barred, though the International Olympic Committee has been considering allowing the Russian athletes to march under their national flag and in their country\u2019s uniforms for the closing ceremony, which they were not permitted to do during the opening ceremony. The Olympic anthem will be played instead of Russia\u2019s national anthem for any winners of gold medals, although no Russians have won so far.\n\nThe failed test is likely to figure in the thinking of the three-person I.O.C. panel charged with deciding whether Russia\u2019s team could be reinstated for the closing ceremony and its athletes allowed to parade with the Russian flag.\n\nThe panel is also closely monitoring the reaction from Russian officials to the failed test. Should they dispute the verdict or make critical comments it would be practically impossible to restore the Russian team before the end of the Games, said a person familiar with the group\u2019s thinking. Complicating matters further is Russia\u2019s continued failure to pay a $15 million fine levied by the I.O.C. as a response to the doping scheme. The fine is nonnegotiable.\n\nThe Russians allowed to participate in South Korea were subjected to what Olympics officials described as a rigorous testing regimen, and have found themselves under scrutiny from testers as the event has progressed.\n\n\u201cOn the one hand it is extremely disappointing when prohibited substances might have been used, but on the other hand it shows the effectiveness of the antidoping system at the Games, which protects the rights of all the clean athletes,\u201d the International Olympic Committee said in a statement Sunday.\n\nMeldonium caused confusion among Russian athletes when it was added to the list of banned substances by the World Anti-Doping Agency. Scores of athletes, including the five-time Grand Slam tennis champion Maria Sharapova, tested positive for it.\n\nThe antidoping agency eventually ruled that more research was required to understand how long the substance, known as mildronate in Russia, remained in the system, as some athletes claimed they had consumed it before the ban had come into force.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nExperts have said it is possible that trace amounts of the substance would still be detectable for a few months after an athlete stopped taking it, but it is unlikely it would still be present if an athlete stopped taking the drug before the ban went into effect in January 2016.\n\nEastern European scientists have promoted meldonium\u2019s health benefits, saying it increases blood flow. Increased blood flow also provides more oxygen to muscles and could increase endurance. While curling is far from cross-country skiing in terms of exertion, curlers spend hours on their feet and vigorously sweep the ice at regular intervals.\n\nMany of the athletes involved, though not Sharapova, eventually had their suspensions lifted because it was not clear when they had taken the substance.\n\nKrushelnytsky was part of the mixed doubles team that won a bronze medal last week, a rare bright spot for the depleted Russian Olympic squad, which has struggled without some of its top stars.\n\nIn the curling event, he appeared to do most of the pair\u2019s sweeping. They defeated Kristin Skaslin and Magnus Nedregotten of Norway in the bronze medal match, 8-4.\n\nThe Russian team actually had a chance to win its semifinal against Switzerland, but Krushelnytsky overshot a target on his final shot of the match, and Switzerland advanced to the final, where it was defeated by Canada.", "keywords": ["officials", "failed", "athletes", "olympics", "team", "seoul", "ceremony", "newsletter", "russias", "antidoping", "leaves", "test", "doping", "athlete", "olympic", "russian"], "polarity": 0.10170068027210885, "subjectivity": 0.429675615389901},

Here at the Pyeongchang Games, Kenworthy, 26, has engaged in physical displays of affection with men in public.
