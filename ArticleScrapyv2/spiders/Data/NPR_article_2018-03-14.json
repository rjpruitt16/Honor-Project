At an elementary school in Virginia, students prepared a handwritten folder with information for the press.\n\nIn Silver Spring, Md., a long line of sign-holding students walked down a major street, with a police escort blocking traffic.\n\nAnd outside the White House, young protesters chanted: \"Hey hey, ho ho! The NRA has got to go!\"\n\nAccording to EMPOWER, the youth branch of the Women's March, more than 3,130 school walkouts were scheduled across the country, as NPR's Adrienne St. Clair reports.\n\nThe national organizers called for a 17-minute walkout at 10 a.m. local time in every time zone.\n\nBut the actual details of the protest varied from school to school.\n\nSome walked out earlier in the day. Adrienne spoke to students at Centennial High School in Idaho who scheduled their walkout for 9:28 a.m., when the bell rings, rather than 10 a.m. \"This will allow students to walk out in between classes, rather than getting up in the middle of a class,\" Adrienne writes. \"[Student body president Tommy] Munroe said some students may be too scared to leave if they are in a class with a teacher who doesn't support the march, and so may not have an opportunity to participate.\"\n\nOn the other hand, in Providence, R.I., student activists pushed the protest later, to 12:45 p.m., because \"students aren't allowed back into school once we walked out,\" Dorbor Tarley explains on Facebook.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jessica Kourkounis/Getty Images Jessica Kourkounis/Getty Images\n\nAnd some schools are going far beyond just a 17-minute walkout.\n\nStudents in some areas organized marches, letter-writing campaigns and rallies with speakers, taking up part or all of the school day.\n\nVarious school districts also face different responses from administrators. Some have told students they won't punish walkout participants. Others emphasize that normal school rules are still in place, and leaving class or campus without permission will result in disciplinary action.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jessica Kourkounis/Getty Images Jessica Kourkounis/Getty Images\n\nSome administrators promoted alternative forms of protest, like a moment of silence, or found ways to incorporate the protest into a lesson plan.\n\nMeanwhile, the ACLU is working to educate students about their rights. Schools can discipline students for walking out of class, even for a political protest, the group notes.\n\n\"But what they can't do is discipline you more harshly because of the political nature of or the message behind your action,\" the ACLU writes. \"The exact punishment you could face will vary by your state, school district, and school.

They \"stayed out of public view for fear protesting gun violence would make them targets of more violence, \" she writes. Media were banned from observing protests at most schools, the Post and Courier reports.\n\nIn Washington, D.C., students from Fairfax County's Thomas Jefferson High School traveled to the U.S. Capitol and sat on the steps, NPR's Brakkton Booker reports, as a \"sea of young protesters\" gathered in front of the Capitol chanting, \"enough is enough\" and \"books not bullets.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Tyrone Turner/WAMU Tyrone Turner/WAMU\n\nAt Boston University, medical students students and professors gathered for a walkout with a slightly different demand \u2014 they called not just for gun control, but for research into gun violence. (As NPR's Rebecca Hersher put it earlier this month, scientists have objected for decades to \"a profound, and purposeful, lack of federal funding for gun research.\")\n\nIn the Bronx, students marched to their council member's office, chanting, \"They say get back, we say fight back,\" Danny Lewis of WNYC reports.\n\nIn Hillsboro High School in Nashville, Tenn., students chanted \"not one more\" and \"this is what democracy looks like\" after their demonstration outside their school, Julieta Martinelli of member station WPLN reports.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Tyrone Turner/WAMU Tyrone Turner/WAMU\n\nIn Southwest Detroit, a school walkout at Western International High School included remarks in three languages \u2014 English, Spanish and Arabic \u2014 member station WDET reports. \"We really need to talk about gun violence here in Detroit, because that's something we've normalized over the last couple of years,\" senior Alondra Alvarez told the station.\n\nAt West Liberty-Salem High School in Ohio, the site of a school shooting last year, a small group of students joined the nationwide protest despite being warned they would be punished. Superintendent Kraig Hissong said students who walk out \"will receive disciplinary action\" and \"the absence will be counted as unexcused.\" Still, 10 students left the school as supporters cheered from across the street, The Associated Press reports.\n\nAt Flathead High School in Kalispell, Mont., students similarly showed up for a moment of silence \"despite pressure from school administration not to leave their classrooms,\" Nicole Miller from KAJ News, a local TV station, reports.\n\nAt Rapid City Central High School in South Dakota, students gathered in an auditorium where organizers told the crowd, \"This is not a protest. This is a walkout,\" Chynna Lockett of South Dakota Public Broadcasting reports. Then students signed letters to the president expressing opposition to gun violence.\n\nIn Draper, Utah, students gathered outdoors with mountains as a dramatic backdrop. One student at Corner Canyon High School told KUER's Lee Hale, \"This shooting made me an activist.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Kelsie Moore/KUER Kelsie Moore/KUER\n\nIn Colorado Springs, the walkout prompted \"dynamic conversations,\" Ali Budner of KRCC reports. Teachers, students and community members gathered outside the school in a ring \u2014 while some students \"stayed inside to protest the walkout,\" Budner says.\n\nIn Davenport, Iowa, a Twitter account for the local walkout said the students there \"are not fighting the 2nd amendment or pushing gun control at all, we are advocating for more [active shooter response] drills, teacher and counselor resources to treat those with mental health issues.\"\n\nIn Chicago and the surrounding suburbs, about 100 schools had walkouts, member station WBEZ reports. The station has collected accounts from students on their website. WBEZ's Miles Bryan reports that one school, in \"conservative Plainfield,\" is giving students who walk out a choice: \"either have a meeting with lawmakers to learn about political process\u2014 or get one hour detention.\"\n\nIn San Diego, at Patrick Henry High, students held up signs \u2014 including one reading, \"we go to school to learn, not to die,\" reports Megan Burks of KPBS News. One student speaker, expanding beyond gun control, urged students to \"look up from your cell phones. Look up from your AP tests. Look up from the soccer field.

Special Election. Here's What It Means\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Drew Angerer/Getty Images Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nUpdated at 3:50 p.m. ET\n\nDemocrat Conor Lamb appears to have won the special election in Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District, defeating Republican Rick Saccone in an upset for President Trump and congressional Republicans, based on a review of the vote by member station WESA and barring a recount.\n\nThat a Democrat is even close in this Western Pennsylvania congressional district can mean only one thing \u2014 bad news for Republicans in this midterm year.\n\n\"We should be able to elect a box of hammers in this district,\" veteran Republican strategist Mike Murphy told the Washington Post's Robert Costa. \"If we're losing here, you can bet there is a Democratic wave coming.\"\n\nWhy the alarm bells?\n\nConsider: Not only is this a district President Trump won by about 20 points in November 2016, as plenty have pointed out, but there are 118 Republicans sitting in seats Trump won by less than the 18th Congressional District in Pennsylvania. Democrats need to flip a net of 24 seats to take back control of the House.\n\nIt's important to not overread the results of any special election, but the result \u2014 no matter which way it goes in the end \u2014 raises questions about the Trump coalition and how much it transfers to the Republican Party broadly; the GOP's messaging on everything from continuing to use House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi as a cudgel to the tax bill; and whether Republicans can hold off a Democratic wave given that this result was yet another example of Democrats' holding on to the enthusiasm advantage.\n\nWhere the race goes from here\n\nMember station WESA has reviewed current vote counts from all of the individual counties in the district. That count shows Lamb with a lead of 627 votes. Between provisional ballots, absentee ballots and military/residents overseas ballots still outstanding, there are only 618 votes left to count based on the latest numbers. That gives Lamb an insurmountable lead.\n\nThis is barring the potential for a protest recount, which would be based on evidence of voter fraud or errors in counting. Pennsylvania law does not provide for an automatic recount in congressional races.\n\nThere is no timeline for certification of the race at this point, according to the Pennsylvania secretary of state's office.\n\nA recount is an outside possibility at this point. One would be triggered if three people in each precinct come forward with evidence of voter fraud or counting errors. Loosely, they have until the middle of next week to do that.\n\nWarning signs for GOP that the Trump coalition may not be transferable\n\nWhite, working-class voters were key to Trump's presidential victory \u2014 and there are plenty of them in this district.\n\nTrump won whites with some or no college education by 39 points, a wider margin than any candidate since at least 1980.\n\nThere are no exit polls to know for sure how this group voted Tuesday, but Lamb made clear appeals to them \u2014 and it would be impossible to make up a 20-point gap without at least some crossover. In fact, dozens of precincts went more Democratic than in the 2016 election.\n\nLamb also benefited from Saccone's history of supporting \"right to work\" legislation in the state Legislature. The district has a sizable number of union households that might have been willing to support a different Republican candidate, but unions and the Lamb campaign were able to define Saccone as anti-union.\n\nAlso, turnout was pretty high, especially for a special election in March. It was so high, in fact, more people voted than in the gubernatorial general election during the last midterm in 2014.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jeff Swensen/Getty Images Jeff Swensen/Getty Images\n\nWhat's more, the approximately 228,000 people who went to the polls were 78 percent of the approximately 294,000 cast for Republican Rep. Tim Murphy. Murphy ran unopposed in 2016 but resigned last October amid a sex scandal, which set this special election in motion.\n\nRepublicans spent some $10 million to try to hold this district (that won't even exist in nine months because of the maps' being redrawn by the state Supreme Court) and turn out their voters. But despite the relatively high turnout, Saccone got only about 113,000 votes (the same as Lamb) \u2014 less than 40 percent of Murphy's total in 2016.\n\nTrump made an eleventh-hour visit this past weekend to try to help Saccone over the line.\n\n\"I think the president helped close this race,\" House Speaker Paul Ryan contended Wednesday, per NPR's Susan Davis.\n\nBut that does not appear to have been enough.\n\nThe Pelosi factor and the tax bill messaging\n\nDoes this win for Democrats mean they will start to abandon Pelosi? It very well might, but it depends on the district. A couple of things to look at:\n\nRepublicans seemed to abandon talk of the tax bill, something Democrats point to as the weakness of its message. (One moderate Democratic member of Congress, though, told NPR last week he thinks it's been Democrats who have struggled with how to speak out against the tax bill, as some people see higher paychecks.)\n\nRepublicans also hit Lamb hard, trying to tie him to Pelosi. But it didn't work this time. Lamb cut a conservative Democratic figure and distanced himself from the minority leader.\n\nTo which Ryan had this to say: \"This is something that you're not going to see repeated, because they [Democrats] didn't have a primary. They were able to pick a candidate who could run as a conservative, who ran against the minority leader, who ran on a conservative agenda. You will have primaries in all these other races, and the primaries bring them to the left. So I just don't think this is something they're going to be able to see a repeat of.\"\n\nBut it provides a road map for Democrats in these very kinds of districts if they want to win. That has to be worrying for Republicans.\n\nIt also does raise the question of what Democrats do about Pelosi. If they win the House back in large measure by running against Pelosi, can they really then turn around and re-elect her speaker this fall? And there's the question of whether enough Democratic candidates will vow not to support her for speaker that she can't get elected.\n\nThe suburbs and making inroads in rural areas\n\nFifty-two percent of Lamb's vote came from the suburban precincts in Allegheny County outside Pittsburgh.\n\nIf Democrats are going to win back the House, their road goes through the suburbs. Nationally, in 2016, Trump won the suburbs with 49 percent. In 2012, Mitt Romney got 50 percent in them. So that's key.\n\nLamb won only a handful of precincts in the other three more rural counties in this district, but dozens of precincts went more Democratic than in the 2016 presidential election for Trump.\n\nIn other words, Lamb was able to cut into Republican margins \u2014 and when every vote counts, as in a race like this, it can make all the difference.\n\nNPR's Arnie Seipel contributed to this report.", "keywords": ["pelosi", "appears", "democrat", "trump", "republican", "election", "democrats", "conor", "lamb", "district", "heres", "democratic", "special", "pa", "won", "means"], "polarity": 0.11978323980983555, "subjectivity": 0.4591707258462578},

Smith/AFP/Getty Images\n\nUpdated at 3:58 p.m. ET\n\nPresident Trump has picked economist and CNBC commentator Larry Kudlow as director of the White House National Economic Council, and Kudlow has accepted the post, the White House said Wednesday.\n\nKudlow, 70, will replace Gary Cohn, who stepped down after losing a battle against imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.\n\n\"Larry Kudlow was offered, and accepted, the position of Assistant to the President for Economic Policy and Director of the National Economic Council,\" White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said. \"We will work to have an orderly transition and will keep everyone posted on the timing of him officially assuming the role.\"\n\nA longtime free-markets conservative who worked on Wall Street, Kudlow supports most traditional Republican fiscal policies, which may quiet concerns among congressional Republicans and investors that the president will surround himself with trade protectionists.\n\nKudlow has known Trump for years and advised him on policy matters during the 2016 campaign. He largely supports the president's agenda and has been a big advocate of his tax cuts.\n\n\"Trump and the GOP are on the side of the growth angels with the passage of powerful tax-cut legislation to boost business investment, wages, and take-home family pay,\" Kudlow wrote after the Republican tax bill passed in December.\n\nBut he has criticized Trump's trade policies. For example, he recently said any move to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement would be a \"calamitously bad decision.\"\n\nLike Cohn, he also opposed the steel and aluminum tariffs announced earlier this month, telling CNBC: \"In the Reagan years, we used to call the free traders the 'white hats' and the protectionists the 'black hats.' The black hats won this time around and I'm very sorry, because it will damage the economy to some extent.\"\n\nKudlow told The Wall Street Journal he had voiced his concerns to the president and was encouraged by Trump's decision to exempt Canada, Mexico and Australia from the tariffs.\n\n\"He said to me several times, 'I believe in global trade. I regard myself as a global trader, but it has to be fair trade to protect America,' \" Kudlow told the Journal. \"I'm on board with that. I personally hope widespread tariff use \u2014 it doesn't come to that. But in some cases, it will.\"\n\nOn his recent podcast, Kudlow noted: \"Mr. Trump has a negotiating style that is very interesting to me. He comes at you \u2014 like he's going to punch you in the teeth with all these tariffs. But then he pulls back and starts making, you know, negotiating deals that can work. That looks to me like, you know, that's his art of the deal. It's in his book. That looks to me like what he's doing here on tariffs. He comes out really hard and strong. Scares everybody. But then he starts to pull back and withdraw.\"\n\nKudlow does not have an economics degree. After serving in the White House Office of Management and Budget under President Ronald Reagan, he was hired as chief economist at Bear Stearns. But he was forced out amid struggles with drug use, a problem he has spoken about publicly.\n\nSince then he has been a regular commentator and host on CNBC and has written often on economic matters. But he was criticized for repeatedly downplaying the economy's troubles in the months leading up to the Great Recession.\n\n\"There ain't no recession,\" he wrote in December 2007. \"The Bush boom is alive and well.\"\n\nKudlow also warned that subsequent Federal Reserve policies aimed at stimulating the economy would lead to higher inflation, which didn't happen.", "keywords": ["picks", "kudlow", "tariffs", "policies", "commentator", "cnbc", "economic", "larry", "adviser", "president", "house", "trump", "trade", "white"], "polarity": 0.08482363315696649, "subjectivity": 0.33783814950481617},

Sheriffs across the state take excess money as personal income \u2014 and, in the event of a shortfall, are personally liable for covering the gap.\n\nEtowah County Sheriff Todd Entrekin told the News that he follows that practice of taking extra money from the fund, saying, \"The law says it's a personal account and that's the way I've always done it.\"\n\nSheriffs across the state do the same thing and have for decades. In most cases, the public doesn't know how much money is involved because sheriffs do not need to report extra income of less than $250,000 a year.\n\nBut in Etowah County, that cap was exceeded, and the News found the paper trail.\n\n'Following the letter of the law'\n\nThe News discovered the eye-popping figures on ethics disclosures that Entrekin sent to the state: Over the course of three years, he received more than $750,000 in extra compensation from \"Food Provisions.\"\n\nThe paper also found that Entrekin and his wife own several properties worth a combined $1.7 million, including a $740,000 four-bedroom house in Orange Beach, Ala., purchased in September.\n\nWithout the provision funds, Entrekin earns a little more than $93,000 a year, the paper says.\n\nIn a statement emailed to NPR, Entrekin said the \"liberal media has began attacking me for following the letter of the law.\"\n\nFROM THE ARCHIVES 2009: Ala. Sheriff Jailed For Starving Inmates Ala. Sherriff Jailed For Starving Inmates Listen\n\n\"The Food Bill is a controversial issue that's used every election cycle to attack the Sheriff's Office,\" Entrekin said. \"Alabama Law is clear regarding my personal financial responsibilities of feeding inmates. Until the legislature acts otherwise, the Sheriff must follow the current law.\"\n\nBefore he made headlines for profiting off the law, Entrekin was better known for being indebted by it.\n\nWhen Entrekin's predecessor died while still in office, all the money in the food provision account went to his estate \u2014 as state law dictated, a county official told NPR. Entrekin had to borrow $150,000 to keep the inmates fed. He was paying down that debt for years, The Gadsden Times reported.\n\nIn 2009, while he was still in debt from paying for inmates' food, Entrekin told the Times that he personally thought the law needed to be changed. But he noted that it might cost more money for taxpayers if the county commission had to manage jail kitchens through an open bid process.\n\nDavid Akins, the chief administrative officer of the Etowah County Commission, agrees with that assessment. He says the commission is not eager to take on that duty, as some other local governments have done.\n\n\"The sheriff can feed inmates cheaper than the county can,\" he said.\n\nInmate's diets, sheriff's responsibility\n\nAlabama's controversial system hearkens back to a different era, when county jails were more of a mom and pop operation and feeding inmates was often the responsibility of a sheriff's wife.\n\nToday in Alabama, sheriffs are personally responsible for feeding inmates in their jails and receive funds to cover the cost. For state inmates, it's less than $2 per inmate per day; for county, city or federal inmates, the amount can be higher.\n\nIf sheriffs feed inmates on less than that, they can \"keep and retain\" whatever is left over.\n\nLawyer Aaron Littman, at the Southern Center for Human Rights, said in a January statement that the practice of pocketing leftover funds was a \"dubious interpretation\" of the law that \"raises grave ethical concerns, invites public corruption, and creates a perverse incentive to spend as little as possible on feeding people who are in jail.\" He argues the sheriffs are supposed to manage the funds, not personally profit from them.\n\nBut local governments across the state say the law is clear that the money can be kept for personal use.\n\n\"That's the way it was set up years ago,\" Akins from the Etowah County Commission tells NPR. \"That's just the way it's been in the state. ... Of course, state legislators could always change that if they wanted to.\"\n\nHe doesn't see a problem with the practice.\n\n\"I think if the inmates were not being fed properly, it might be a concern,\" he said. \"But I'll guarantee you that if they're not fed properly, the federal government would let us know about it.\"\n\n'Sheriff Corn Dog' and bankrupt car lots\n\nIn some cases, the federal government has objected.\n\nIn 2009, then-Sheriff Greg Bartlett of Morgan County was briefly tossed in jail after acknowledging that he had personally profited, to the tune of $212,000, from a surplus in the jail-food account. Prisoners testified about receiving meager meals.\n\nTo cut corners, Bartlett used charitable donations and \"special deals,\" as CBS put it \u2014 including once splitting a $1,000 truck full of corn dogs with a sheriff of a nearby county and then feeding the inmates corn dogs twice a day for weeks.\n\nHe defended himself by noting that his profit was legal under state law, but an exasperated federal judge said the sheriff had an obligation to feed his inmates adequate food.\n\nThe story made national headlines, and Bartlett agreed to no longer dip into the jail food fund.\n\nIn 2015, a sheriff in Morgan County loaned $150,000 from the inmate food fund to a corrupt car lot. The loan was revealed when the business, facing theft and scam charges, went bankrupt.\n\nAgain, that sheriff's use of the food money was legal under state law; it was only prohibited in Morgan County because of the county's particular history.\n\nAside from individual lawsuits like those, it's hard to tell exactly how much money earmarked for inmate food is going to sheriffs because no funds under $250,000 need to be reported to the state.\n\nThis January, two advocacy groups sued for access to records that could reveal how much jail food money was being turned into personal profit. The groups said 49 sheriffs had refused to provide records of where funds were spent.\n\nThen in February, reporter Connor Sheets of the News began revealing Entrekin's spending history and his ethics disclosures.\n\n'I put two and two together'\n\nSheets' investigation has also made headlines because of the arrest of a key source.\n\nSheets spoke with a landscaper named Matt Qualls who mowed Entrekin's lawn in 2015 and noticed the name of the account on his checks \u2014 the \"Sheriff Todd Entrekin Food Provision Account.\" He shared pictures with Sheets.\n\n\"A couple people I knew came through the jail, and they say they got meat maybe once a month, and every other day, it was just beans and vegetables,\" Qualls told Sheets. \"I put two and two together and realized that that money could have gone toward some meat or something.\"\n\nSheets' initial story was published on Feb. 18. On Feb. 22, Qualls was arrested and charged with drug trafficking after an anonymous call complained of the smell of marijuana from an apartment.\n\nQualls, who had never been arrested before, faces six charges and is being held on a $55,000 bond, Sheets reports. He is detained in a jail that Entrekin oversees.\n\nQualls was arrested by Rainbow City Police, not by the sheriff's department.\n\nThe Etowah County Drug Enforcement Unit added extra charges to his case, including a charge of drug trafficking, which the Rainbow City Police chief said was based on inaccurate weight calculations. (The unit counted 14 grams of pot, infused in five cups of butter, as more than than 1,000 grams worth of marijuana.)\n\n\"Penalties for drug trafficking are extremely steep in Alabama, where people have been imprisoned for life for the crime,\" Sheets notes.\n\nThe sheriff's office denies involvement in Qualls' case, noting that the landscaper was not arrested or charged by the sheriff's office. The extra charges were added by the Drug Enforcement Unit, which consist of agents drawn from the sheriff's department, the FBI and other law enforcement agencies.", "keywords": ["meant", "alabama", "entrekin", "jail", "sheriff", "took", "law", "bought", "house", "inmates", "money", "county", "state", "sheriffs", "food", "feed", "beach", "legally"], "polarity": 0.061822089947089966, "subjectivity": 0.31043733465608475},

The person did not say how long the wind-down will take but said the shutdown will not be immediate.\n\nThe chain employs more than 30,000 people in the U.S. and includes Babies R Us stores.\n\nToys R Us has struggled with a heavy load of debt inherited from a 2005 buyout, as well as intense competition from Walmart, Amazon and Target \u2014 made worse by disappointing holiday sales.\n\nThe chain \u2014 whose history traces back to a post-World War II baby furniture store \u2014 has spent many decades as the country's largest dedicated toy emporium. In 2017, Toys R Us accounted for roughly one-fifth of toy sales in the U.S., according to Jefferies analyst Stephanie Wissink.\n\nBut in recent years, Toys R Us has found itself amid a trifecta of demographic and social changes, Wissink says.\n\nToday's parents are the millennial generation who grew up with the Internet and approach purchasing decisions and time they spend with children differently from baby boomers. Generally, foot traffic is falling at brick-and-mortar stores. And children are playing differently than they used to decades ago.\n\n\"Kids are generally happily scheduled many nights of the week,\" Wissink says, \"so the ability to devote dedicated time to play is being constrained.\" They spend more time on activities and with electronic screens, she says.\n\nWissink also points out that the toy business is seasonal \u2014 three-quarters of sales take place during the holidays. This has weighed on Toys R Us, especially in the face of massive pressure from Amazon and Walmart.\n\nWithout Toys R Us, Wissink estimates that 85 percent to 90 percent of the shopping that would normally happen at the toy chain would shift to other retailers.\n\n\"What I worry about are many, many small companies,\" she says \u2014 toymakers not big enough to negotiate deals with the giant retailers, but which have relied on being discovered by Toys R Us shoppers. \"Many of those companies are likely going to be up for sale,\" Wissink says.\n\nAt a Toys R Us store in Bailey's Crossroads, a Virginia suburb of Washington, D.C., numerous shoppers were turning up to spend their gift cards, worried about the impending closings.\n\nMary Henely brought her son Thomas to buy some Legos. \"I recognize that it's a sign of the times with online shopping, perhaps. But I think it's disappointing,\" said Henely, who said she shops at Toys R Us about once a month.\n\nEunice Turner came to the store to buy in-line skates for her daughter. \"It's sad,\" she said about the decline of Toys R Us. \"In wintertime I look forward to going to Toys R Us, because this is the only place where kids can actually see toys and play \u2014 more than Kmart, more than Walmart and all those places. This is just meant for kids.\"\n\nBusiness Eyeing Toys R Us' Future, Analyst Suggests Hands-On Displays Eyeing Toys R Us' Future, Analyst Suggests Hands-On Displays Listen \u00b7 4:13 4:13\n\nThe company has been laden with $5 billion in debt \u2014 a relic of a 2015 leveraged buyout. Private equity firms Bain Capital and KKR, together with real estate investor Vornado Realty Trust, took over Toys R Us and loaded the company with debt.\n\nFor years, Toys R Us paid a hefty interest fee. Meanwhile, the chain lagged further behind in technology and online sales strategy, while missing the mark on some major investments, such as licensed Star Wars toys and Lego movies.\n\nWhen Toys R Us declared bankruptcy in September, the company said it would keep its stores open while it tried to regain financial footing. In January, Toys R Us announced plans to close almost 200 stores. While most retailers saw a boon from a perky holiday shopping season, Toys R Us faced what it called \"operational missteps.\"\n\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal, Toys R Us owes a lot to the biggest toymakers: \"Mattel and Hasbro are among Toys 'R' Us's biggest unsecured creditors. Mattel is owed more than $135 million, while Hasbro is owed $59 million, according to court papers.\"\n\nNPR's Ian Wren contributed to this report.", "keywords": ["r", "chain", "business", "toys", "wissink", "game", "going", "toy", "stores", "store", "company", "spend"], "polarity": 0.06265151515151515, "subjectivity": 0.49424242424242426},

One major change this time, however, is that Florida teenagers who survived the violence are spearheading the conversation.\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee officially joined the discussion Wednesday with a hearing that opened with Florida's senators begging their congressional colleagues to act.\n\n\"We've had our fill of this in Florida the last two years,\" said Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., before he listed the many mass shootings the state has endured, including the Pulse nightclub massacre in June 2016 that killed 49 people.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., raised his voice as he noted that the alleged Parkland shooter, Nikolas Cruz, \"didn't slip through one crack, he slipped through every crack.\"\n\nWatch The Hearing\n\n\"This tragedy was the result of two things: the first is of a multi-systemic failure of government agencies at the federal, state and local levels,\" said Rubio. \"And second because of vulnerabilities in our existing laws that need to be addressed.\"\n\nQuestions about the FBI's actions fell to acting FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich, who testified alongside the acting director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, Thomas Brandon, and the head of the National Threat Assessment Center, Lina Alathari.\n\nBowdich walked senators through the timeline of when the FBI knew what about Cruz and the potential threat he posed.\n\nIn September 2017, Bowdich said, the FBI received an email tip about someone posting on YouTube under the name Nikolas Cruz: \"I'm going to be a professional school shooter.\"\n\nAnd then in January, the bureau's tip line received a call from a close friend of Cruz's family warning that he had made statements about harming himself and others. The caller said they were concerned about him \"shooting up a school,\" Bowdich said.\n\nThe FBI operator who took the phone call found the YouTube comment thread and consulted her supervisor. After that, however, the investigation was closed without any information being forwarded to any FBI field offices or any state or local law enforcement agencies.\n\nAfter questions from senators, Bowdich said the nature of the conversation between the operator and her supervisor remained unclear because the they gave differing accounts.\n\n\"This is not the kind of news I want to deliver to this committee, to the families, or to the public, but we are committed to transparency in all that we do on behalf of the American people,\" Bowdich said. \"When we make mistakes, we will not hide from them.\"\n\nBowdich said the FBI is conducting a full-scale review of the tip line, which he said received some 765,000 calls, and 735,000 emails, last year.\n\nLocal law enforcement also reportedly missed red flags. The Broward Sheriff's Office also received a tip about Cruz potentially being a \"school shooter in the making,\" according to the Miami Herald. The newspaper says deputies didn't report the warning.\n\nSenate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said he was frustrated that representatives from the sheriff's office declined to testify on Wednesday.\n\nRyan Petty, whose daughter Alaina died in the shooting, and a teacher at the high school, Katherine Posada, also gave statements and took questions as part of the hearing.\n\nPetty asked the lawmakers to put aside the basic divisiveness of broad gun control measures, to focus on specific common-sense reforms. Two weeks ago, Senate Republicans decided not to vote on gun legislation that would have changed the background check system for most gun purchases.\n\n\"Americans are deeply interested in safe schools, in caring communities and in secure neighborhoods. As the family of one of the victims, we've learned at great personal cost that Americans can come together,\" Petty said. \"We do not have to all agree on guns, and we won't. But we can agree on the most fundamental things.\"\n\nWhen asked by Grassley what Congress could do to honor his daughter's memory and legacy, Petty answered simply: Make sure \"that this never happens again.\"", "keywords": ["fbi", "school", "parkland", "tip", "mishandling", "answers", "gun", "shooter", "congress", "cruz", "questions", "state", "shooting", "received", "bowdich"], "polarity": 0.07339793281653746, "subjectivity": 0.3006376891842008},

Prime Minister Theresa May has said Russia was likely behind the poisoning of a former Russian spy who, along with his daughter, was exposed to a lethal nerve agent that was developed in Russia.\n\nMay called the attack a \"barbaric act\" as she announced the punishment on Russia on Wednesday. She said the U.K. has revoked an invitation to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to visit Britain, citing Russia's \"affront\" to international standards and laws.\n\nBoth Sergei Skripal, who worked for Britain while serving in Russia's intelligence service, and his daughter, Yulia, remain hospitalized after being found slumped over on a bench in Salisbury, England, on March 4. A police officer is also receiving treatment after responding to the scene. An investigation found they were exposed to a lethal Novichok nerve agent \u2014 a material that is viewed as the exclusive property of Russia.\n\nRussia, the prime minister said, is \"culpable for the attempted murder\" of Skripal and his daughter.\n\nRussia has denied involvement, with officials saying the country is the victim of \"unfounded accusations.\"\n\nMay said Russia's \"response has demonstrated complete disdain for the gravity of these events. They have provided no credible explanation. ... Instead, they have treated the use of a military-grade nerve agent in Europe with sarcasm, contempt and defiance.\"\n\nMay said the U.K. government is freezing Russian state assets in her country and canceling plans for high-level bilateral meetings with Russia. While acknowledging that a British-Russian relationship is important, she said that in the wake of the attack, \"this relationship cannot be the same.\"\n\nIn addition to those moves, May said that at this summer's World Cup hosted by Russia, there will be no high-level delegation of visitors from Britain, including members of the royal family.\n\nBritish officials had given Russia until midnight Tuesday to respond to its findings that the country was behind the use of the lethal nerve agent on U.K. soil.

But not even the combined talents of the secretaries of Transportation, Commerce, Labor, Agriculture and Energy seemed enough to move the ball on the $1.5 trillion plan, and it remains unclear whether the measure will ever find its way to a vote in the House or Senate.\n\nSenate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee chairman John Thune, R-S.D., said he was hopeful that \"both sides can come together on this and it can happen this year.\"\n\nBut several unanswered questions remain, chief among them where the $200 billion in federal funding would come from and where states would find the remainder of the money.\n\nThe Trump plan commits $200 billion in federal funding over 10 years to stimulate state and local spending and private investment. Half of the funding, $100 billion, would be used as incentives to entice cities, counties and states to raise at least 80 percent of the infrastructure costs themselves.\n\nThat's a departure from the way many projects are funded now. Funding for federal-aid highways, including interstates, is usually allocated in an 80-20 federal-state split. So, President Trump's plan would flip that funding burden. Major mass transit projects are often funded on a 50-50 federal-local basis. Again, the administration's plan puts a much greater burden on local taxpayers and users.\n\nEstimates vary but the American Society of Civil Engineers has opined that there is a $2 trillion investment gap when it comes to the country's infrastructure needs.\n\n\"How are you gonna get members of the Senate to vote for the tax revenue in order to pay for these plans?,\" asked Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., the ranking Democrat on the panel. \"We can't toll our way out,\" he said. Nelson suggested that the recently-enacted tax cut be changed from a 21-percent corporate rate to 25 percent to pay for infrastructure, a non-starter as far as most Republicans are concerned.\n\nTransportation Secretary Elaine Chao said that with some estimates as high as $4 trillion to repair the nation's roads, bridges, ports and airports, \"We cannot address a challenge of this magnitude with federal resources alone, or by borrowing.\" She said the administration was \"agnostic\" about where the state share of the funds would come from, but said the federal government only owns 10 percent of the nation's roads and bridges, implying it was up to state and local governments to figure out where to find the funds to finance their share of improvements.\n\nSeveral states have already raised their gas taxes to fund road repairs, and others have instituted new tolls.\n\nSen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., said Congress and the administration have \"got the identification of the problem down cold,\" adding the challenge is \"how we're going to pay for it.\" The administration's plan, he said was \"just smoke and mirrors.\"\n\nAddressing criticism that the administration only released an outline of what it hopes to see in an infrastructure plan, Chao said the administration sent Congress a list of principles rather than specific legislation in \"an open show of cooperation.\" She said the administration wants to work with Congress \"and not be prescriptive\" with specific legislative language.\n\nOne of the key principles for the administration, said Energy Secretary Rick Perry, was removing regulatory barriers to speed approval of construction projects. Perry called the current permitting process fractured and redundant, saying \"it requires projects to navigate a huge maze of federal regulations.\" Perry said Trump wants to see the process streamlined and \"substantially cut back.\"\n\nWednesday morning, the president tweeted thanking the Senate committee for helping with his effort to improve the nation's infrastructure. The president wrote that the nation's infrastructure was \"crumbling,\" and said \"We need to build FAST & we need to build for our FUTURE.\"", "keywords": ["nations", "trillion", "push", "funding", "secretaries", "projects", "administration", "congress", "trump", "federal", "cabinet", "way", "plan", "infrastructure"], "polarity": 0.03296226150392817, "subjectivity": 0.37083613916947245},

But thanks to heavy government censorship of media and the Internet, there was little visible debate or opposition to the move.\n\nThe term limits were one of a number of political reforms enacted during more liberal times in the 1980s. The ease with which Xi swept the limits away suggests what shallow roots they had sunk into a land dominated for thousands of years by absolute monarchs.\n\nUnder the leadership of then-paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, the Communist Party decided in 1981 to \"put an end to the virtually lifelong tenure of leading cadres, [and] change the over-concentration of power,\" in the words of an official document on the subject.\n\nThe following year, China amended its constitution, limiting the presidency to two five-year terms. The nation's president has less power than the head of the Communist Party and military, which carry no term limits.\n\nBut Zhang says there is an unwritten consensus among senior officials that party and military leadership are also limited to two five-year terms and that leaders at the apex of power would retire at age 68.\n\nThe early 1980s changes were largely symbolic, but important. The symbolism is that \"while hereditary monarchs rule for life, democracies have presidential term limits,\" says Wu Guoguang, a political scientist at Canada's University of Victoria. In other words, the rules were intended to make China look like the people's republic it claims to be.\n\nThey were also meant to move the country away from decades of turmoil under Mao Zedong, whose violent political campaigns killed millions and took the national economy to the brink of collapse.\n\nBut while Deng expected others to stick to the rules, he himself flouted them. He ruled China almost until he died in 1997, despite officially retiring years before.\n\nIn fact, only one of China's eight top leaders in nearly seven decades of communist rule has retired and relinquished power on schedule, and that was Xi's predecessor, Hu Jintao. All the others were either purged or found ways to cling to power despite formal and informal regulations.\n\nTenuous and superficial as the regulations were, Xi's breaking them is historically significant and seen by Chinese liberals as a big step backward.\n\nUniversity of Victoria's Wu points out that Xi frequently exhorts officials not to forget the Communist Party's history and original mission. But just what was that mission?\n\nThe Communists promised to liberate China from the dictatorship of the Nationalists. Before that, the Nationalists promised to emancipate the nation from centuries of feudal autocracy under imperial dynasties.\n\nBut, Wu argues, both Communists and Nationalists eventually betrayed their promises and came to resemble what they once tried to overthrow.\n\nHistory aside, critics have also picked apart the Communist Party's various legal and political explanations for abolishing presidential term limits.\n\nThe party claims its public opinion surveys show that officials and commoners approve of Xi's performance and want him to stay on. But they have not released any such survey, allowed others to conduct their own or let citizens express their opinions at the ballot box.\n\nHowever, speak to lawmakers or ordinary people on the street and you will hear from many that they are pleased with Xi's progress in combatting corruption, his more assertive foreign policy and a resulting boost for China's international stature.\n\nThe party claims it does not intend for leaders to necessarily rule for life. The Central Party School's Zhang argues that if a leader does not perform well, the party's National Congress can keep him from getting another term. But that remains to be seen.\n\nCrucially, the party argues that abolishing term limits puts the presidency in line with the unlimited tenures for the party and military heads \u2014 and that strengthening this \"trinity\" of leadership is good for long-term political stability.\n\nBut Wu points out that the \"trinity\" has no basis in Chinese law and that the three positions have been separate for most of Communist rule. If anything, he says, the \"trinity\" is \"an institutional manifestation of the overconcentration of power in one person.\"\n\nThe party claims to govern China according to the nation's constitution. By that logic, its charter should be brought into line with the constitution, not vice versa, Wu adds. Instead of removing presidential term limits from the constitution, term limits for party general secretary should be written into the party's charter.\n\nThe Central Party School's Zhang predicts term limits may one day be rewritten into the constitution and the party charter.\n\nChina's \"transition from thousands of years of feudal rule to socialist democracy is more complex than we thought,\" he says. \"It may be hard to make the transition stably in less than a century\" since the founding of the people's republic.\n\nThe full centennial will come in 2049, by which time Xi Jinping will be 96 years old.", "keywords": ["abolishing", "deal", "constitution", "big", "chinas", "limits", "party", "power", "wu", "presidential", "communist", "china", "rule", "term"], "polarity": 0.05508241758241759, "subjectivity": 0.3990476190476191},

The outcome appears as though it will be decided by outstanding absentee ballots. But Lamb and national Democrats declared victory anyway, given that Saccone needed to win a huge percentage of those absentees to close the gap.\n\n\"It took a little longer than we thought, but we did it,\" Lamb told a roaring crowd at his election watch party at nearly 1 a.m. Wednesday morning.\n\nIntroduced as \"congressman-elect,\" the Democrat struck a conciliatory tone and promised bipartisanship once he heads to D.C.\n\n\"We fought to find common ground and we found it, almost everywhere. Democrats, Republicans, independents \u2014 each of us, Americans. ... Our job in Congress is to attack the problems, not each other,\" Lamb said.\n\nBut just before midnight, Saccone had come out to speak to his supporters, expressing confidence that they could still win.\n\n\"It's not over yet,\" the GOP nominee said. \"We're going to fight all the way to the end. ... We're not giving up.\"\n\nJust minutes after Saccone finished speaking, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee blasted out a statement declaring Lamb the victor, despite AP's having said it would not call the race Tuesday evening.\n\n\"These results should terrify Republicans. ... Candidates and message matter and that was on full display in this election,\" DCCC Chairman Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n said.\n\nMeanwhile, the National Republican Congressional Committee signaled it is still waiting for all remaining ballots to be counted.\n\n\"This race is too close to call and we're ready to ensure that every legal vote is counted,\" said NRCC Communications Director Matt Gorman. \"Once they are, we're confident Rick Saccone will be the newest Republican member of Congress.\"\n\nAllegheny County counted its absentee ballots Tuesday evening. The elections director for Washington County told CNN it had 1,195 absentee ballots returned that would not be counted until Wednesday morning, but the county later reversed course and said it would begin counting them late Tuesday evening into the wee morning hours. And officials from Westmoreland County also told CNN that the 1,138 absentee ballots would be counted shortly as well, instead of on Wednesday morning.\n\nEven with such a photo finish, there is no provision for an automatic recount in a congressional race \u2014 only in statewide contests, per Pennsylvania election law. Voters can petition for a recount, however.\n\nPresident Trump won this Pittsburgh-area district by about 20 points in 2016, but it's Lamb who has run a high-energy race to challenge Saccone, after Rep. Tim Murphy, R-Pa., resigned last year amid a sex scandal. Republicans have privately grumbled that their candidate has been lackluster, and the Democrat seemed poised to pull off the upset.\n\nIf Lamb does eke out the win, it would be the latest sign of worry yet for Republicans this fall. It's evidence of just how motivated Democrats are in 2018 and shows that the blue-collar coalition President Trump was able to build in the 2016 campaign is not necessarily transferable to other Republicans.\n\nWhile the close margin may give some solace to wary GOP members, it's still another example of Republican candidates way underperforming not just Trump's 2016 numbers but the past performance of the district, too. Murphy routinely won re-election and didn't even face a Democratic challenger the past two cycles. Other special congressional elections last year in deep red territory in Kansas, Montana and South Carolina also ended much closer than expected.\n\nIf Republicans do lose this seat, the fact they were unsuccessful also shows that the GOP's economic argument to voters and touting its tax cuts may not be enough to save the party at the ballot box, either. While early ads in Pennsylvania focused on a fiscal message, closing arguments from Republican outside groups hit Lamb on immigration and crime instead.\n\nTrump visited the district for a rally on Saturday as a last-ditch rescue mission, where he asked his supporters, \"Do me a favor. Get out on Tuesday and vote for Rick Saccone.\" Trump also referred to the Democrat as \"Lamb the sham,\" saying that if elected, Lamb would vote as House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi wants, even though the candidate has said he would not support keeping her as leader of the Democratic caucus.\n\nThe president's visit capped off a massive effort by GOP groups to keep the seat in Republican hands. More than $10.6 million has been spent to support Saccone, about twice as much as has been spent for Lamb. That massive expenditure is despite the fact that the district won't even exist in its current form come November because of court-ordered redistricting, underscoring just how desperate Republicans were to avoid an embarrassing loss that would portend a growing blue wave.\n\nLamb had outside support in the final days from former Vice President Joe Biden, a Pennsylvania native. The young former prosecutor and Marine veteran homed in on local issues and eschewed most national help, and even Republicans concede he has been an unusually tough candidate.\n\nIf Saccone does win, President Trump would get credit for juicing Republican turnout in the final days. But even if he loses, the president does seem to have moved some election day voters the GOP's way, which Trump will surely seize on as well.\n\nData in the last week of the race backed up assertions from the district that Saccone's fundraising was weak. Of the more than $10 million spent to support his campaign, less than 10 percent was from the Saccone campaign itself. On the Democratic side, about two-thirds of the money spent to support Lamb came from his campaign.\n\nLoading...\n\nNational Democrats largely took a hands-off approach to the race and left most of the responsibility to Lamb's campaign, at least publicly. The DCCC stopped airing television ads weeks ago, leaving the Lamb campaign to purchase and air its own spots. But on the eve of the possible upset, the DCCC said it had invested more than $1 million in the race.\n\nThat mirrors the approach the national party took in last year's Alabama Senate race. In Pennsylvania, the DCCC largely spent the money in a behind-the-scenes way meant to help Lamb keep the race locally focused. The national party transferred more than $400,000 to Pennsylvania's Democratic Party and spent $170,000 on digital ads and turnout efforts.\n\nIn addition to that, the Democratic National Committee directed $370,000 into the race. The DNC sent $150,000 to the state party and helped the Lamb campaign raise an additional $220,000 through a joint email fundraising effort.\n\nOne byproduct of all that money and the television ads that blanketed the Pittsburgh media market in recent weeks was a lot of confused voters. Pittsburgh public radio station WESA reported that election officials in Allegheny County fielded calls all day from angry would-be voters wanting to know why their polling place was closed. The answer: These people don't live in the 18th Congressional District.\n\nDemocrats say that enthusiasm swing in a 20-point Trump district shows just how energized their voters are, even though it was a close race. It would be the first flip for House Republicans in the Trump era. A Georgia race also drew a lot of attention and money last year, but the GOP candidate eventually prevailed. Now, a Lamb victory would come on the heels of other Democratic victories, including big wins last year in the Virginia and New Jersey gubernatorial contests, flipping 39 state legislative races from red to blue and an upset in last year's Alabama Senate race.", "keywords": ["close", "trump", "republicans", "republican", "election", "district", "lamb", "race", "pennsylvania", "campaign", "saccone", "democratic", "special"], "polarity": 0.06367665304581194, "subjectivity": 0.3865059136087177},

United says it was \"a tragic accident\" and that it is investigating.\n\nThe incident prompted shock, outrage and sadness, particularly after it emerged that a flight attendant had required the dog, a 10-month-old French bulldog, to be placed into the overhead bin, despite the family having followed all the rules about flying with a pet in an airliner's cabin \u2014 including using a TSA-approved pet carrier.\n\n\"Why would the flight attendant force the woman to put her dog there?\" wrote passenger Maggie Gremminger, in a tweet. Gremminger, who had been seated near the family, added, \"I could have done something. I'm so upset.\"\n\nThe dog had been traveling with a woman who also had her young baby and her older daughter on the flight with her. The animal died during the more than three-hour trip. Since then, the airline has agreed that the situation never should have unfolded the way it did.\n\nIn a statement, United said:\n\n\"This was a tragic accident that should never have occurred, as pets should never be placed in the overhead bin. We assume full responsibility for this tragedy and express our deepest condolences to the family and are committed to supporting them. We are thoroughly investigating what occurred to prevent this from ever happening again.\"\n\nThe family was on United Flight 1284, from Houston to New York's LaGuardia airport. Their flight Monday night lasted 3 hours and 25 minutes, according to an online tracking site. And while passengers said they had heard barking during the trip, the dog's owners realized the dog had died after retrieving the travel carrier from the bin.\n\n\"I just flew into LGA and witnessed a United flight attendant instruct a passenger to put her dog bag in the overhead bin. It was clearly a dog and while the customer was adamant about leaving it under the seat, the attendant pushed her to do so,\" Gremminger wrote on Twitter.\n\n\"Myself and a fellow passenger felt like that was NOT a thing. I am not a flight attendant tho. Maybe they have air ventilation in there that I didn't know about. I tried googling rules about pets on board but didn't have ample time before [takeoff].\"\n\n\"At the end of the flight, the woman found her dog, deceased. She sat in the airplane aisle on the floor crying, and all of surrounding passengers were utterly stunned.\"\n\n\"I am disgusted and traumatized,\" Gremminger said via Twitter. \"Pets are family. How could a trained flight attendant instruct a passenger to place her dog in that bin. It was her job to understand the plane and it's rules/limitations.\"\n\nThe plane landed a little before 11 p.m. \u2014 but Gremminger said the experience left her unable to sleep. She began sharing the story on Twitter, including a photo of the family who lost their dog. From there, both interest and disbelief snowballed online, along with anger. Gremminger says it all became a blur, as she fielded questions and spread the story.\n\nGremminger spoke to numerous media outlets on Tuesday, from NBC and CBS to People magazine and Fox News.\n\nIt's the latest black eye for United, which has endured a string of recent public relations nightmares, from passengers being dragged off flights to another case of a dog dying after a United domestic flight one year ago \u2014 in that case, the large animal had flown in a crate in a plane's hold, and was under the care of United's PetSafe program.\n\nUnited says its policies allow for dogs, cats and some types of pet birds (no cockatoos are allowed) to travel in its planes' cabins. If a passenger brings a pet carrier in addition to a carry-on bag, they must pay an extra $125.\n\n\"A pet traveling in cabin must be carried in an approved hard-sided or soft-sided kennel,\" United's policy on animals reads. \"The kennel must fit completely under the seat in front of the customer and remain there at all times.\"\n\nThe airline adds that soft-sided kennels, like the type used by the family on Monday night's flight, can be slightly larger because they're able to be compressed without becoming an obstruction.\n\nGremminger issued a final tweet on Tuesday, saying \"the past 24 hours have been insane.\"\n\n\"My hope was to gain some media attention so that we can collectively raise our awareness about pet safety + travel.\"\n\nThanking those who have helped to spread and amplify the story, Gremminger said she hoped that a \"day of shouting to media outlets\" will help prevent similar tragedies from happening.\n\n\"Everyone loves dogs,\" she wrote. \"Everyone wanted to hug that family who lost their dog last night.

Stephen Hawking, who has died at the age of 76, family members told British media early Wednesday, was definitely a contender.\n\n\"He was a great scientist and an extraordinary man whose work and legacy will live on for many years,\" the family statement said, according to The Guardian. \"His courage and persistence with his brilliance and humour inspired people across the world. He once said, 'It would not be much of a universe if it wasn't home to the people you love.' We will miss him for ever.\"\n\nHawking was probably the best-known scientist in the world. He was a theoretical physicist whose early work on black holes transformed how scientists think about the nature of the universe.\n\nBut his fame wasn't just a result of his research. Hawking, who had a debilitating neurological disease that made it impossible for him to move his limbs or speak, was also a popular public figure and best-selling author. There was even a biopic about his life, The Theory of Everything, that won an Oscar for the actor, Eddie Redmayne, who portrayed Hawking.\n\nWide appeal and a sense of humor\n\nWhen he came to scientific conferences, the audience hung on every word. And it wasn't just the scientists who stood in awe: The general public flocked to him as well. His popular book about his work was a best-seller.\n\n\"He agreed that that book, A Brief History of Time, was probably the least-read, most-bought book ever,\" says Leonard Mlodinow, a physicist and science writer at the California Institute of Technology. Mlodinow collaborated with Hawking on a less technical version of Hawking's first book, called A Briefer History of Time.\n\nThat title hints at what Mlodinow says was a central part of his character \u2014 Hawking's sense of humor.\n\n\"As hard as it was for him to communicate, he would sit there sometimes, and would take five or six minutes to be typing something out,\" Mlodinow says. \"And then when he hit speak, and his system voices his words, it would be a joke.\"\n\nThat sense of humor, along with his fame, allowed Hawking to land some pretty unusual gigs for a physicist. He appeared on The Simpsons several times \u2014 as well as on a number of other popular shows, including Futurama and Star Trek, The Next Generation.\n\nIn one episode of The Simpsons, Hawking showed a willingness to poke fun at himself \u2014 and, in a way, the entire culture of science.\n\n\"Your theory of a doughnut-shaped universe is intriguing, Homer,\" Hawking tells Homer Simpson. \"I may have to steal it.\"\n\nChanging our understanding of physics\n\nSo what did this man who re-envisioned the universe really do? What was his science all about?\n\nLawrence Krauss, a theoretical physicist who is on leave from Arizona State University and was a friend and colleague of Hawking's, says that at a young age, Hawking discovered something \"truly remarkable.\"\n\nKrauss says before Hawking, physicists thought that the immense gravity of a black hole would draw everything in and nothing could escape. But by combining quantum mechanics and the theory of relativity, Hawking showed something astonishing: That theoretically, at least, some kind of particle had to defy what physicists classically expected from gravity, and radiate out of black holes.\n\n\"That radiation is now called Hawking radiation,\" Krauss told NPR in 2012. \"And it changed everything about the way we think about gravity.\"\n\nKrauss says Hawking pointed out a fundamental problem with the way physicists understand our world \u2014 a problem that Krauss says has yet to be resolved.\n\n\"And therefore,\" Krauss says, \"his influence and his legacy is quite profound.\"\n\nToward the end of his life, Hawking's disease left him virtually paralyzed. It took an enormous effort for Hawking to communicate, using the tiny movements he could make to control a computer interface. It's tempting to say that Hawking achieved his fame in spite of his physical challenges.\n\nBut in a way, Hawking's physical challenges may have contributed to his mental prowess, says Kip Thorne, a physicist at the California Institute of Technology who frequently collaborated with Hawking.\n\n\"It was because of this handicap that he developed new ways of thinking,\" Thorne says, \"new ways of wrapping his brain around things that enabled him to out-think anybody else in the field.\"\n\nAnd he out-thought people with great regularity.\n\nFree from gravity\n\nThroughout his life, Hawking was up for a challenge. For example, in 2007, he accepted an offer from Zero G Corporation to experience weightlessness. The company uses a plane that climbs and then dives in such a way that for 25 seconds at a time, everyone inside the plane is weightless.\n\nAt a news conference before his flight, Hawking said, \"I have been wheelchair-bound for almost four decades, and the chance to float in zero-G will be wonderful.\"\n\nPictures taken during the flight show what appears to be a very happy physicist floating, chair-free, around the plane's cabin.\n\nFitting, really, for the scientist who changed the way we think of gravity to spend a few minutes of his life without it.", "keywords": ["scientists", "public", "mlodinow", "physicist", "stephen", "gravity", "hawkings", "awed", "university", "caption", "way", "hawking", "previous", "dies"], "polarity": 0.10003721424774058, "subjectivity": 0.3630739728108148},

Here are some areas in which the change could make a difference.\n\nNorth Korea\n\nTillerson was caught flat-footed last week when Trump abruptly accepted an invitation for face-to-face talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Tillerson, who was traveling in Africa, had told reporters just a day earlier that the U.S. was \"a long ways from negotiations\" with Pyongyang.\n\nTrump acknowledged he hadn't discussed the idea in advance with Tillerson. \"Rex wasn't, as you know, in this country,\" Trump told reporters on Tuesday. \"I made that decision by myself.\"\n\nPompeo defended the president's move but stressed the U.S. and its allies will continue to press North Korea in advance of any Trump-Kim summit.\n\n\"This administration has its eyes wide open, and the whole time this conversation takes place, the pressure will continue to mount on North Korea,\" Pompeo told CBS. \"There is no relief in sight until the president gets the objective that he has set forth consistently during his entire time in office.\"\n\nThat objective is denuclearization. According to South Korean officials who met with Kim, the North Korean leader expressed a willingness to discuss it, though it's not clear exactly what that means.\n\nIran\n\nTrump has threatened to tear up the Iran nuclear deal, negotiated by the Obama administration and five other countries, although so far he has stopped short of doing so. The deal gives Iran relief from certain international economic sanctions in exchange for suspension of its outlaw nuclear program. Tillerson and other national security advisers have urged the president to move carefully in overturning the deal, arguing that despite Iran's other transgressions, the nuclear agreement is working.\n\nThis was one of the key differences Trump cited in explaining Tillerson's dismissal.\n\n\"We disagreed on things,\" Trump said Tuesday. \"When you look at the Iran deal, I think it's terrible. I guess he thought it was OK. I wanted to either break it or do something, and he felt a little bit differently.\"\n\nPompeo, like the president, has been a fierce critic of the Iran deal, saying it doesn't go far enough in dismantling Tehran's nuclear program and that it's not permanent.\n\n\"President Trump is determined to prevent that from happening in North Korea,\" Pompeo told CBS. Trump's reluctance to live by the terms of the Iran agreement, however, may affect U.S. credibility in negotiations with Pyongyang.\n\nTrade\n\nTillerson's ouster comes just days after Trump fired the opening salvo in what critics warn could become a trade war. The former Exxon Mobil CEO was among the advisers who reportedly tried to stop the president from ordering steep tariffs on imported steel and aluminum.\n\nPompeo defended the president in an interview with Fox News Sunday, especially with regard to China, which is widely blamed for the glut of steel and aluminum on the world market.\n\n\"It was very clear that what the Chinese are doing, whether that'd be on trade or the theft of intellectual property or their continued advancement in East and South China Seas, this administration is prepared and engaged in pushing back against the Chinese threats so that we can have a good relationship with China in a way the world desperately needs,\" Pompeo said.\n\nChemistry\n\nTrump told reporters Tuesday that he wished Tillerson well but conceded he and the former secretary of state often didn't see eye to eye. The president regularly undercut Tillerson, once tweeting that he was \"wasting his time\" in pursuing a diplomatic approach to North Korea.\n\nTillerson, in turn, made little effort to hide his disdain for the president. He pointedly did not deny an NBC report last October that he had once called Trump a \"moron.\"\n\nPompeo, who often delivers the president's intelligence briefing in person, enjoys a better relationship with Trump.\n\n\"For whatever reason, chemistry, whatever it is,\" Trump told reporters. \"Right from the beginning, from Day 1, I've gotten along well with Mike Pompeo.\"\n\nFormer CIA Director Michael Hayden suggests that Trump and Pompeo share a similar worldview, which has pluses and minuses.\n\n\"I think having a secretary of state who's more compatible with the president, who sounds and thinks more like the president, will actually make some things easier for the administration,\" Hayden told Morning Edition on Tuesday. \"On the other hand, Secretary Tillerson was a counterweight to some of the instantaneous, spontaneous, instinctive decisions that the president was prone to make.

But this year, the state legislature is going into a special session to continue discussions about whether or not to include it in its budget. By the time the regular session adjourned Saturday, members of Virginia's GOP-controlled House of Delegates and Senate could not reach agreement on whether or not to expand Medicaid.\n\nRepublican Delegate Barry Knight from the Virginia Beach area calls it \"the 800-pound gorilla in the room.\" He's one of more than a dozen Republicans who voted to include Medicaid expansion in the House budget \u2014 along with a work requirement \u2014 this year.\n\nIt's a big shift in the House position on the issue and comes after 15 seats flipped in the so-called \"blue wave\" of last November's election, which also saw the election of Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam.\n\n\"On the big-picture issues, I think it was a re-awakening and a call to look at things from a different perspective,\" says Republican Delegate Chris Peace, from the Richmond area.\n\nAt a recent rally outside the state Capitol in Richmond, Northam continued his campaign message. \"Are you all ready to get this done?\" he called to the crowd's cheers. \"Are you ready to expand coverage?\"\n\nA December poll showed over 80 percent of likely Virginia voters support an expansion.\n\n\"I think the House heard that message, loud and clear. I think the Senate still needs to listen a little bit,\" Northam says.\n\nHe's referring to a strong movement against expansion, led by Senate Majority Leader Tommy Norment from the Tidewater area in southeastern Virginia. Norment has come out against the House Republicans who want to expand. He reminds them that despite a slim margin, Republicans are still in charge and could stop Medicaid expansion.\n\n\"I do think that the House of Delegates is waiting for that moment of lucidity and epiphany to realize that their majority is 51 to 49,\" Norment says.\n\nBut President Trump has managed to mobilize Democratic voters, says Bob Holsworth, a former political science professor at Virginia Commonwealth University. He thinks expansion has a greater chance this year.\n\nIt could pass in the Senate, he says, because of a potential wildcard.\n\nThat wildcard is Republican Sen. Emmett Hanger, from mostly-rural central Virginia. Hanger has expressed support for some form of Medicaid expansion, and has a track record of voting independently, says Holsworth.\n\n\"What Hanger has said that's very interesting ... is that if he decides to support some version of Medicaid expansion, he says, 'There are a number of other Republicans who are going to go over with me.' \"\n\nHowever, Hanger isn't happy about a tax on hospitals that has been incorporated into the House's budget to help pay for the state's share of expansion costs. The tax accounts for about three quarters of the over $400 million Medicaid-related gulf between House and Senate budgets.\n\nIf legislators don't come up with a budget that includes Medicaid expansion, Northam has a plan B. He says he'll introduce an amendment to add it back into the budget. In the amendment process, the lieutenant governor, Justin Fairfax, gets a vote if the Senate ties. Fairfax says he'd be happy to vote to expand coverage to up to 400,000 low-income Virginians.\n\n\"There are so many people that we can help and we have the means to do it if we expand Medicaid. We just have to have the political will to do it,\" Fairfax says.\n\nAmong those expansion would help in Virginia: low-income adults without children.\n\n\"An adult who does not have children can have zero income \u2014 can be totally impoverished \u2014 and they cannot get Medicaid,\" says Jill Hanken with the Virginia Poverty Law Center.\n\nAnd a family of three with a total income of about $10,000 doesn't qualify for Medicaid, she says.\n\n\"It's hard to explain to them that they don't have a choice, they're not eligible for Medicaid,\" she says, and they're not eligible for subsidies for insurance on the exchange, so health insurance is out of reach. \"And the reason is because Virginia hasn't expanded Medicaid,\" she says.\n\nThe special session begins April 11. The state needs a budget agreement by June 30 to prevent a government shutdown.\n\nThis story is part of a reporting partnership with NPR, local NPR stations and Kaiser Health News.", "keywords": ["think", "republicans", "expand", "expansion", "house", "virginia", "medicaid", "budget", "hanger", "senate", "divided"], "polarity": 0.1359292328042328, "subjectivity": 0.4262438949938949},

That's a drop from 2016, when there were 171 such cases.\n\nThe numbers released today by the National Registry of Exonerations shows that Texas still led the nation with 23 exonerees last year followed by Illinois (21), Michigan (14) and New York (13).\n\nProfessor Barbara O'Brien, a Michigan State University law professor and editor of the National Registry, says a record high number of cases, 84 of the 139, were tainted by official misconduct by police, prosecutors and other government officials.\n\nMistaken eyewitness identification and false confessions also played a role, while perjury and false accusations affected a record 87 cases.\n\nO'Brien says that could be witnesses who have it in for a defendant or those who are trying to protect someone, to police perjury.\n\nIn all, 98 of the exonerations involved violent felonies: including homicides, child sex abuse convictions and sexual assaults of adults. In 66 of the cases, no crime was actually committed. Four of the homicide exonerees had been sentenced to death.\n\nThe wrongfully convicted inmate who served the longest time in prison before being exonerated was 61-year-old Ledura Watkins of Michigan.

For example, in 2016 there were 61 and last year 16.\n\nMost of that decline occurred in Harris County \u2014 home to Houston.

There are more than 3,130 largely student-organized walkouts scheduled, according to EMPOWER, the group behind the national school walkout. National organizers, who are the youth branch of the women's march, are advocating stricter gun regulation including bans on assault weapons and expanded background checks.\n\nWhile EMPOWER coordinated nationally, each school needed a leader organize locally. Rexhepi, who is the local high school caucus chair for the Young Democrats, took it upon herself to be that person for Centennial High School in Boise.\n\nShe said she felt responsible to do something because she knows she's often viewed as a student leader.\n\n\"I probably shouldn't wait for someone who just wants to advance their resume with a school shooting,\" she said, \"which I don't think is OK at all.\"\n\nEighteen-year-old Tommy Munroe, who is Centennial's student body president, feels a sense of urgency about this issue because, he said, Stoneman Douglas \"could've just as easily been my high school.\" He doesn't want his generation \u2014 \"the generation of Sandy Hook\" \u2014 to become desensitized to gun violence.\n\nFor Munroe, it's important for students to be able to be actively involved in politics \u2014 and for lawmakers to listen.\n\n\"If the government wants to keep getting paid, they need to listen to what we say,\" he said.\n\nRexhepi said that the overall message of the walkout is to encourage some type of change, and she's encouraged by the national effort.\n\nBut even with her role in the Young Democrats, Rexhepi said that politicians and political parties are part of the conflict in the debate about guns.\n\n\"It's become more about political party than actual beliefs,\" she said.\n\nRexhepi worked hard to get the word out about plans for the walkout. She made flyers, which then found their way onto social media. Soon everyone knew, including the administration.\n\nThe principal met with her and some of her classmates. To their surprise, they weren't in trouble. It took some convincing, but soon the walkout had the administration's support.\n\nAccording to Rexhepi and classmate Tommy Munroe, school administrators initially said they would clear student absences and even agreed to announce the walkout over the intercom.\n\nSchool reactions to the walkout have been as varied as opinions on gun rights.\n\nEven other Boise schools are responding differently. The neighboring Boise School District sent memos to parents saying their schools would follow regular attendance guidelines, meaning that parents would need to call to excuse their child's absence even if he or she were participating in the walkout.\n\nAdministrators in the Boise School District were also directed to provide \"alternative activities during lunch and break by which students can express their concerns and opinions,\" according to the memos, which were sent to NPR by Dan Hollar, a spokesman for the school district.\n\nNPR's Tovia Smith recently reported several schools that have made students afraid to participate in the walkout. For example, teachers at a high school in Boston were threatening students with write-ups and suspensions.\n\nBut on the other side of the country in Idaho, Centennial High School's student body president Tommy Munroe said his friend Egzona Rexhepi has made an effort to make it easy for students to participate if they want to.\n\nOne of the ways she made it easier, he said, is by adjusting the time of the walkout. While most of the country's walkouts are planned for 10 a.m., Centennial's is planned for 9:28 a.m. when the bell rings. This will allow students to walk out in between classes, rather than getting up in the middle of a class.\n\nMunroe said some students may be too scared to leave if they are in a class with a teacher who doesn't support the march, and so may not have an opportunity to participate.\n\nRexhepi, Munroe and other classmates have dealt with some opposition from students on the other side of the issue. Earlier this week, Rexhepi had organized a poster-making party to prepare for the walkout. A student came in and used supplies Rexhepi had purchased with her own money to make an anti-protest poster. But Rexhepi wasn't deterred.\n\n\"Everyone has their own individual beliefs, those are what the posters are for, is for people to express their voices and their opinions because they have a right to do that, of course,\" she said. \"But overall, we all want some type of change. And that's why we're participating in the walkout.\"\n\nAdrienne St. Clair is an intern on NPR's National Desk.", "keywords": ["school", "walk", "parkland", "walkout", "student", "students", "gun", "rexhepi", "month", "munroe", "national", "protest", "violence", "schools", "high", "shooting"], "polarity": 0.10859090909090906, "subjectivity": 0.39420379620379603},

The Metropolitan Police says that its counterterrorism unit is handling the case \"because of associations that the man is believed to have had.\"\n\nGlushkov, 68, was a close friend of Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky, a prominent critic of the Kremlin who was found dead in 2013. At the time, an inquiry found he had hanged himself \u2014 but Glushkov publicly disputed the idea that his friend and former business ally would have killed himself.\n\nAs British media began reporting Glushkov's death, the police issued a statement saying, \"An investigation is underway following the death of a man in his 60s in Kingston borough.\"\n\nThe London Ambulance Service had called police after being summoned to a house in New Malden, where the man was found dead.\n\n\"The death is currently being treated as an unexplained,\" police said, adding that the Metropolitan Police Counter Terrorism Command is leading the investigation as a precaution.\n\nPolice said that they believe they know the man's identity and that his family has been notified, but that officials are still awaiting a formal identification.\n\nGlushkov's death comes a week after former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, were found poisoned in Salisbury, England. Officials in the U.K. say they were the victims of a Russian-engineered nerve agent. The father and daughter remain in critical condition, and British Prime Minister Theresa May has demanded answers from Russia about how the lethal Novichok nerve agent came to be used on U.K. soil.\n\n\"There is no evidence to suggest a link to the incident in Salisbury,\" police said day, as they announced the investigation into Glushkov's death.\n\nOf the Skripal case, British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said, \"the use of this nerve agent would represent the first use of nerve agents on the continent of Europe since the Second World War.\"\n\nRussian officials have rejected the idea that their government is responsible for the attack on Skripal. On Tuesday, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said such claims were \"nonsense.\"\n\nStill, the poisoning and now the unexplained death have resurfaced talk of what many see as a pattern of Russians who run afoul of the Kremlin and later die under suspicious or criminal circumstances.\n\nJust two years ago, the official report emerged about the death of Mikhail Lesin, a former Russian press minister and Putin adviser, whose death had originally been reported by Russian media outlets as the result of a heart attack \u2014 despite the fact that Lesin had died in a hotel in Washington, D.C., and that his death was eventually ruled to have been caused by \"blunt force injuries.\" The manner of death was classified as \"undetermined.\"\n\nAnother notable case involved Alexander Perepilichny, a Russian banker turned whistleblower who died during a jog near his home in Surrey. As NPR's Mary Louise Kelly reported, \"Traces of a rare, poisonous flowering plant were found in his stomach.\"\n\nAs a close associate of Berezovsky, Glushkov was linked to one of the most successful of Russia's oligarchs to emerge from the collapse of the Soviet Union. Berezovsky had been an early ally of Putin \u2014 but their relationship changed drastically, culminating in the tycoon leaving Russia and being locked in a multi-billion-dollar legal battle with another oligarch, Roman Abramovich, over proceeds from the Sibneft oil company. That dispute was eventually settled in Abramovich's favor.\n\nDescribing the suspicions around Berezovsky's death in 2013, the Financial Times reported:\n\n\"He had, after all, long claimed President Putin ordered the 2006 poisoning with radioactive polonium-210 of one of Berezovsky's prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, Alexander Litvinenko, the former KGB agent. He was set to be a witness in a potentially explosive inquest in October into Litvinenko's death.\"\n\nGlushkov refused to believe there had been no foul play in Berezovsky's demise \u2014 particularly as it came years after the death of another ally, the Georgian billionaire Badri Patarkatsishvili, who had died of an apparent heart attack in Surrey.\n\n\"You have the deaths of Boris and Badri over a short period of time. Too many bodies are happening. I would say this is a little bit too much,\" Glushkov told The Guardian in 2013. He added that the list of prominent Russians who opposed Putin was continuing to shrink: \"I don't see anyone left on it apart from me.\"\n\nBerezovsky also controlled the Aeroflot airline \u2014 and Glushkov ran it for him. They were accused of embezzling from the enterprise, and in 2007, a Russian court ordered them to repay millions of dollars. But by then, Berezovsky had moved to London.

He will miss his colleagues at the Department of State and enjoyed working together with the Department of Defense in an uncommonly robust relationship.\"\n\nContinued Goldstein: \"The secretary did not speak to the president this morning and is unaware of the reason, but he is grateful for the opportunity to serve and still believes strongly that public service is a noble calling and not to be regretted.\"\n\nLater Tuesday, Goldstein was also fired, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Goldstein both confirmed to NPR's Tamara Keith.\n\nA senior administration official says White House chief of staff John Kelly called Tillerson on Friday and notified him that he would be replaced and \"that he was being asked to step down. It was made clear that it was imminent.\" The official added that Kelly and Tillerson had a follow-up conversation on Saturday.\n\n\"He was asked to step down,\" the official said, and he didn't.\n\nTrump and Tillerson have been described as talking often but sometimes appeared quite out of step on major foreign policy decisions.\n\nA White House official says the president wanted to have a new team in place in advance of upcoming talks with North Korea and ongoing trade negotiations.\n\nTillerson, who was traveling in Africa last week, was caught flat-footed when the surprise announcement came that Trump had accepted an invitation to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Just a day earlier, he had told reporters that negotiations were a long way off.\n\nTrump has named Gina Haspel, Pompeo's former deputy and a CIA veteran, to take the helm of the spy agency.\n\nHaspel did not require Senate confirmation to serve in her deputy role but will to serve as the full-fledged director of the agency. Her hearing could exhume many CIA demons about the torture of terror suspects and the secret detention program that followed the 2001 terror attack.\n\nDemocrats blasted what they called the nonstop chaos of the Trump White House, which they said meant it cannot focus on conducting business seriously.\n\n\"The instability of this administration in just about every area weakens America,\" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.\n\nBut another sometime-opponent of Trump's, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, R-Tenn., said he would move as quickly as possible to convene a confirmation hearing for Pompeo to run the State Department.\n\n\"I had a very good conversation with Director Pompeo this morning and look forward to meeting with him soon,\" Corker said. \"As I shared with the president, the committee will consider his nomination as expeditiously as possible.\"\n\nSlow burn\n\nTillerson said at the State Department on Tuesday afternoon that he was grateful for the chance to serve in government and he thanked the foreign service officers and others who work on behalf of the United States abroad.\n\nTillerson said he wants to arrange an orderly transition to Pompeo, whose Senate confirmation hearing is expected in April and appears to have the support to move into the State Department job.\n\nPBS NewsHour via YouTube\n\nTillerson said he has begun delegating responsibilities from his office to that of Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan.\n\nA former boss of Exxon Mobil, Tillerson didn't know Trump before 2016, and their relationship seemed to rupture after months of disputes over policy, embarrassing leaks and a few public humiliations by the president himself.\n\nTrump told reporters on Tuesday that he and Tillerson had always gotten along and that he was a \"good man,\" but their friction over tough issues such as the Iran nuclear deal had been what compelled Trump to replace him.\n\nThe campaign may have been in the works for some time. A Nov. 30 report by The New York Times revealed the existence of a secret plan by Kelly to force out Tillerson and replace him with Pompeo.\n\nTrump would then nominate Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., to replace Pompeo, according to the Times. As it happened, Cotton is not getting the nomination to lead the CIA, after all.\n\nThe report took care to say that the plan was \"tentative\" and that Trump hadn't yet approved it.\n\nThat story followed other evidence that the relationship between the president and the nation's top diplomat was barely functional.\n\nTillerson earlier said he would not resign in October after an NBC News report said Tillerson had called Trump a \"moron\" in July after a tense meeting at the Pentagon. Tillerson declined to deny it publicly, and Trump retorted to Forbes magazine that he was ready to compare \"I.Q.\" tests \u2014 \"and I can tell you who's going to win.\"\n\nTrump also undermined Tillerson's efforts to find a diplomatic solution to the situation in North Korea. As Tillerson kept up support for talks with Pyongyang over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, Trump said on Twitter on Oct. 1 that Tillerson was \"wasting his time.\"\n\n\"Save your energy Rex, we'll do what has to be done!\" Trump wrote.\n\nIt was about five months later that Trump agreed to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n\nTillerson had also distanced himself from what critics have called Trump's equivocation between neo-Nazis and counterprotesters, who clashed over a Confederate monument in Charlottesville, Va.\n\nTillerson appeared Aug. 27 on Fox News Sunday and was asked by host Chris Wallace about the way the international community views the United States following Trump's controversial comments about the protesters and counterprotesters in the wake of deadly violence in Charlottesville.\n\n\"We express America's values from the State Department,\" Tillerson said. And later: \"The president speaks for himself, Chris.\"\n\nTillerson's departure makes him the latest member of Trump's inner circle in the administration to step down \u2014 following a series of White House aides, starting with national security adviser Mike Flynn and continuing on to chief strategist Steve Bannon, press secretary Sean Spicer, chief of staff Reince Priebus and chief economic adviser Gary Cohn \u2014 who have left their posts amid administration turbulence.\n\nIn September, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price was ousted over a travel expense scandal.\n\nTillerson leaves behind a State Department that critics have called a shadow of its former self because of Tillerson's disconnection from the department and the White House's antipathy toward appointing or keeping top talent in the nation's diplomatic ranks.\n\nWorld A Diplomat On The Reported 'Hollowing Out' Of The State Department A Diplomat On The Reported 'Hollowing Out' Of The State Department Listen \u00b7 3:54 3:54\n\nSome ambassadorships as well as top jobs at the department's Washington headquarters remain vacant.\n\nAnd speculation has swirled for so long that Tillerson might quit that this isn't the first wave of discussion about prospective replacements. A previous go-round centered on Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. and former governor of South Carolina. The New York Times reported there was tentative talk that Trump might appoint his daughter, Ivanka, as Haley's replacement at the U.N.\n\nFor now, Haley remains in her post in New York and the Ivanka narrative appears to have cooled.\n\nTillerson's tenure as America's top diplomat was unlikely. Trump interviewed more conventional candidates, including 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, but he ultimately gave the nod to the Texas oilman Tillerson based on a recommendation from former Defense Secretary Robert Gates.\n\nTillerson told interviewers early on that he hadn't been looking for the job and was \"stunned\" to get Trump's offer \u2014 but his wife, Renda St. Clair, sold him.\n\n\" 'I told you God's not through with you,' \" as Tillerson recounted his wife's remarks.\n\nOilman\n\nTillerson had no government experience; he went to work in 1975 for Exxon Co., as it was then known, as an oil production engineer. But having risen to become CEO of the descendant Exxon Mobil, he effectively served as a kind of head of state \u2014 not only running the energy behemoth, but also conducting its foreign policy around the globe where it drilled or refined or conducted other operations.\n\nThat work brought Tillerson into contact with all manner of leaders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, who awarded him Russia's Order of Friendship in 2013. Trump and Tillerson met with Putin and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Germany in June, and then Tillerson continued follow-up negotiations with Russia until his departure from office.\n\nAs secretary of state, Tillerson belonged to a cadre of leaders who sometimes preceded Trump on international travel to assuage allies' concerns about him. Or they returned after his visits to try to smooth things over.\n\nTillerson, Vice President Pence, Defense Secretary James Mattis and others emphasized conventional points about American commitment to allies and to international norms and other longstanding points \u2014 often after Trump appeared willing to flout them.\n\nAt the same time, Tillerson stayed in lockstep with the president on many matters of policy. He defended to the State Department press corps, for example, the realism that he said underpinned the administration's new strategy focused on Afghanistan, which amounted to the new goal of playing to a draw.\n\n\"I think the president was clear this entire effort is intended to put pressure on the Taliban to have the Taliban understand: You will not win a battlefield victory. We may not win one, but neither will you,\" he said.\n\nAt the same time, however, the new Afghanistan strategy will remain one of Tillerson's most significant elements of unfinished business. It depended upon a broad new diplomatic campaign across South Asia involving pressure on India and Pakistan to help with a good outcome in Afghanistan \u2014 even though, at the time, the United States did not have active ambassadors in India or Afghanistan.", "keywords": ["trumps", "director", "president", "secretary", "cia", "department", "white", "house", "state", "pompeo", "trump", "replacing", "told", "tillerson", "mike"], "polarity": 0.06945480885957075, "subjectivity": 0.3862154710368994},

Bush.\n\nHaspel's role in it meant that when Trump nominated her for the No. 2 job last year, critics within and outside of Congress called for her to be blocked even though she did not require Senate confirmation.\n\nTo become full director, however, she will. Haspel is up for the top job because Trump fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Tuesday and announced he planned to nominate CIA Director Mike Pompeo to take his place.\n\nSo Haspel would need to go through what could be a bruising confirmation hearing that reopens the vault on secret prisons, torture, alleged cover-ups and accountability.\n\nHaspel would be the first woman to lead the CIA, and Trump told reporters outside the White House that he had gotten to know her well.\n\nIntelligence veterans call Haspel one of their own and say the time is right for her to hold the reins.\n\n\"When she was selected to be deputy director, I think the choice was enthusiastically received at CIA,\" former National Security Agency Director Michael Hayden told NPR's Morning Edition on Tuesday. \"In all this turmoil, I actually think CIA is going to be a bit of a calm spot with Gina now being elevated to the director position.\"\n\nPolitics A Former Director On What Leadership Change Means For The CIA A Former Director On What It Means For The CIA Listen \u00b7 6:12 6:12\n\nEveryone at the CIA in the post-Sept. 11 era was simply doing what they were asked to do in the aftermath of a crisis, Hayden said.\n\nOpponents, however, made clear that they believe the Senate intelligence committee should not confirm Haspel.\n\n\"During Gina Haspel's long tenure at the CIA, she oversaw the agency's torture and rendition program, one of the bleakest chapters in our nation's history. No one who had a hand in torturing individuals deserves to ever hold public office again, let alone lead an agency,\" said Raha Wala, director of national security advocacy for Human Rights First.\n\n\"To allow someone who had a direct hand in this illegal, immoral and counterproductive program is to willingly forget our nation's dark history with torture,\" Wala added.\n\nOther opponents said Pompeo and Haspel should be able to go forward into new roles so long as they made a clear break with brutal interrogations and the past conduct of the CIA.\n\n\"Both nominees would have to disavow all previous statements and actions advocating this unlawful conduct if they are to be seriously considered as candidates,\" said Margaret Huang, executive director of Amnesty International USA.\n\n\"Torture, extraordinary rendition, and indefinite detention are unacceptable, and we cannot allow human rights abuses to be condoned in the name of national security,\" she said.\n\nMany Democrats, however, may fully oppose Haspel. Sens. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico both wrote Trump last year to say they felt she should not get the deputy director job at CIA.\n\nWyden said on Tuesday that he feels the same way now.\n\n\"Ms. Haspel's background makes her unsuitable to serve as CIA director. Her nomination must include total transparency about this background, which I called for more than a year ago when she was appointed deputy director,\" his statement read. \"If Ms. Haspel seeks to serve at the highest levels of U.S. intelligence, the government can no longer cover up disturbing facts from her past.\"\n\nMaine Republican Sen. Susan Collins, a key voice on the intelligence committee, said on Tuesday that she would reserve judgment for now.\n\n\"I have met Gina and I know of her decades of experience at the CIA,\" Collins said. \"I prefer to wait to have a confirmation hearing before making a decision on her nomination. She certainly has the expertise and experience as a 30-year employee at the agency. But I'm sure there's going to be some questions raised.\"\n\nOpponents in the wider Senate made clear there could be no correct answers to these questions.\n\n\"I voted against Mr. Pompeo's nomination to be CIA director because he failed to express moral opposition to torture, but Ms. Haspel has done much worse,\" said Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill.\n\n\"Not only did she directly supervise the torture of detainees, but she also participated in covering it up by helping to destroy the video evidence,\" Duckworth said. \"Her reprehensible actions should disqualify her from having the privilege of serving the American people in government ever again, but apparently this president believes they merit a promotion.\"\n\nIf Democrats elect to oppose Haspel as a bloc in committee or the full Senate, Republicans will need all the votes they can get in order to confirm her, assuming the ailing Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., remains absent from the chamber.\n\nMcCain said on Tuesday: \"The torture of detainees in U.S. custody during the last decade was one of the darkest chapters in American history. Ms. Haspel needs to explain the nature and extent of her involvement in the CIA's interrogation program during the confirmation process.\"\n\nSen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., opposed Pompeo as CIA director, and if he opposes Haspel as well, that could make for a narrow tightrope to walk.\n\nSen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., the chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, however, appeared eager to get Haspel's nomination on his committee's calendar.\n\n\"I know Gina personally and she has the right skill set, experience, and judgment to lead one of our nation's most critical agencies,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm proud of her work, and know that my committee will continue its positive relationship with the Central Intelligence Agency under her leadership. I look forward to supporting her nomination, ensuring its consideration without delay.\"\n\nNPR correspondent Susan Davis contributed to this report", "keywords": ["gina", "trump", "nomination", "road", "director", "confirmation", "intelligence", "cia", "tough", "torture", "nominee", "faces", "committee", "senate", "haspel"], "polarity": 0.03487542696403455, "subjectivity": 0.4211194220687892},

Built by private contractors from across the country, from Maryland to Arizona, the prototypes have been funded with $20 million from Customs and Border Protection.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and several Border Patrol officials briefed the president on the ongoing assessment of the prototypes, the White House says, \"with a focus on how the features and attributes of each impedes illegal crossings.\"\n\nUltimately, the Trump administration expects that the whole border wall, when completed, would cost about $18 billion \u2014 though other estimates have ranged up to $38 billion. Despite a concerted effort from the White House and many GOP lawmakers, efforts to apportion that money have stalled in Congress, along with broader conversations around the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals and other immigration programs.\n\nTrump's campaign pledge to build a massive wall along the border between the U.S. and Mexico has proven just as divisive outside Capitol Hill. Just a day before Trump's arrival in California, the state's Democratic governor, Jerry Brown, called on the president to extend the focus of his visit beyond the wall.\n\n\"You see, in California we are focusing on bridges, not walls. And that's more than just a figure of speech,\" Brown said in a letter to the president he posted publicly Monday.\n\n\"After you've examined your wall prototypes on the border,\" he added, \"I invite you to head north to the Central Valley \u2014 the heart of California. Here in cities like Fresno and Madera more than a dozen bridges are being built for the nation's first and only High-Speed Rail line.\"\n\nOthers, such as San Diego-based immigration advocate Andrea Guerrero, see the president's proposal as an alarming symbol of the policies his administration has pursued.\n\n\"The wall is more than a wall,\" she told NPR's Richard Gonzales before Trump's arrival. \"In the shadow of that wall, a deportation force is growing and it is ripping families from one another. It is devastating communities well within the interior of the United States.\"\n\nDuring remarks to media Tuesday, Trump countered those fears by raising still others.\n\n\"There's a lot of problems in Mexico \u2014 they have a lot of problems over there,\" he said. \"The fact is, if you don't have a wall system it would be bedlam, I imagine.\"\n\nLater, he stopped in at the nearby Marine Corps Air Station in Miramar, addressing an often-boisterous crowd \u2014 and promoting what he called \"the largest military buildup since Ronald Reagan and one of the largest buildups we've ever had in the history of our nation.\"\n\nYouTube\n\nAmong other things, the president promised the assembled members of the military their \"largest pay raise in over a decade,\" brand-new warplanes and and a national strategy that \"recognizes that space is a war fighting domain \u2014 just like the land, air and sea.\"\n\n\"We may even have a 'space force,' \" he added. \"Develop another one: We have the Air Force, we'll have the space force.\"\n\nHe is expected to wrap up his day in Los Angeles with a fundraiser later in the evening.", "keywords": ["largest", "prototypes", "tours", "president", "mexico", "wall", "talks", "military", "border", "trump", "california", "whirlwind", "trip", "mockups", "space"], "polarity": 0.00608108108108108, "subjectivity": 0.3481981981981982},

Actor Mark Wahlberg wound up donating the $1.5 million he was paid for participating in reshoots for the film All the Money in the World, after news broke that his female costar Michelle Williams was paid $1,000. And the BBC recently cut salaries of its top male anchors after an annual report revealed huge gaps between the highest paid men and top earning women at the news network.\n\nExecutives at Left Bank say they have rectified the pay situation. \"Going forward, no one gets paid more than The Queen,\" said creative director Suzanne Mackie, as quoted by Variety.

The lawsuit also names Fox reporters Malia Zimmerman and a periodic Fox commentator.\n\nThe May 2017 story echoed and propelled conspiracy theories about Rich's death and the DNC leaks, strongly suggesting his killing might have been related. U.S. intelligence officials under Presidents Obama and Trump say that people acting at the direction of the Russian government hacked into the DNC's servers.\n\nFox News retracted the story a week later after widespread outrage, but the network never apologized for the story or explained what went wrong.\n\nIn their federal suit, filed Tuesday in the Southern District of New York, the Riches allege that they have been \"collateral damage in a political war\" and say their son's death was exploited for political benefit. A spokeswoman for Fox News said late Tuesday that the network and Zimmerman will not comment, citing the pending litigation.\n\nThe Riches also sued Ed Butowsky, a Dallas investment manager who periodically offered commentary on financial matters for Fox Business Network and Fox News. Butowsky also figured as a defendant in an earlier lawsuit filed last August against Fox News and Zimmerman by their chief named source, a Fox News commentator named Rod Wheeler.\n\nThe Riches' lawsuit alleges \"extreme and outrageous conduct\" by Fox, Zimmerman and Butowsky in developing a false story \"painting Joel and Mary's son as a criminal and a traitor to the United States.\" They also allege the network, the reporter and the investor made it appear that Joel and Mary Rich were involved in the deception.\n\nButowsky had arranged for Wheeler, a former Washington, D.C., homicide detective, to be hired by the Riches as a private investigator to look into their son's unsolved killing. He paid Wheeler's bills. And he had connected Zimmerman with Wheeler as well, according to materials that were part of Wheeler's lawsuit.\n\nThe backdrop involved Butowsky's efforts to draw upon reporting by Seymour Hersh and his White House meeting with former Trump administration spokesman Sean Spicer, as NPR later detailed.\n\nThe original Fox News story cited a federal investigator who had seen an FBI forensic report said to detail contacts Seth Rich made with WikiLeaks. After its retraction, Fox News said the story had not been subjected to sufficient editorial scrutiny and that the network would investigate further. Fox has never again mentioned or explained the reference to the FBI report or the unnamed federal investigator.\n\nIn a message to Fox News hosts contained in the Wheeler lawsuit, Butowsky wrote that he was \"actually the one who's been putting this together\" in urging them to conclude on-air \"the Russians did not hack our computer systems and [steal] emails and there was no collusion like trump with the Russians.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Butowsky told NPR he was puzzled by having to respond to the Riches' lawsuit. \"This lawsuit claims that an article I did not write, and did not participate in writing, caused emotional distress,\" he said.\n\nButowsky also told NPR that he feels for the Riches. \"Not only do I empathize with a grieving family, I spent money to try to help them,\" Butowsky says, referring to his hiring of Wheeler.\n\nThe Riches' lawsuit states that Butowsky sought out the Riches and recruited Wheeler, who, it alleges, worked for the benefit of Fox News and Zimmerman.\n\nSpicer told NPR last summer that Butowsky was a reliable surrogate on economic issues for the Republican Party and for Trump. Wheeler's lawsuit cites specific messages sent by Butowsky invoking White House and even the president's support for the story, alleging that Butowsky wrote to Wheeler that they should do \"whatever we've got to do\" to help push Zimmerman across the finish line. In another, Butowsky wrote, \"Not to add any more pressure but the president just read the article. He wants the article out immediately.

Reporter James Rosen Left Network After Harassment Claims\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Shannon Stapleton/Reuters Shannon Stapleton/Reuters\n\nOn the Friday before Christmas, Fox News confirmed that its chief Washington correspondent, James Rosen, had left the network. He had worked there for 18 years and become something of a legend. The U.S. Justice Department under the Obama administration was so frustrated by his reporting on U.S. intelligence about North Korea that it conducted a leak investigation into his sources.\n\nThe network cited no reason for Rosen's exit and did not announce it on the air. According to Rosen's former colleagues, however, he had an established pattern of flirting aggressively with many peers and had made sexual advances toward three female Fox News journalists, including two reporters and a producer. And his departure followed increased scrutiny of his behavior at the network, according to colleagues.\n\nThis story is based on interviews with eight of Rosen's former colleagues at the Fox News bureau in Washington, D.C., just a few blocks from the U.S. Capitol. Rosen declined to comment to NPR after it set out in detail what it intended to report.\n\nRosen's behavior was drawing attention from Fox News at a time when its controlling owner, Rupert Murdoch, declared there had been no allegations of sexual misconduct at the network since the ouster of the late Fox News chairman and CEO, Roger Ailes, in July 2016.\n\n\"There was a problem with our chief executive, sort of, over the years, isolated incidents,\" Murdoch said in a mid-December interview with Sky News, another news outlet in which he has a controlling stake. He then said Ailes was gone in three or four days after complaints were made. (Murdoch actually ousted Ailes 13 days after former host Gretchen Carlson filed suit against Ailes on July 6, 2016. Five years earlier, Fox News had paid $3 million to settle allegations from a former network booker that Ailes had coerced sex from her. The Murdochs say they were not aware of the payment at the time.)\n\nMurdoch went on: \"There's been nothing else since then. That was largely political because we're conservative.\"\n\nMurdoch's 21st Century Fox, Fox's parent company, had to issue a statement cleaning up the damage caused by those remarks among outraged female employees. Many female former Fox News journalists other than Carlson had come forward to attest to sexual harassment by Ailes (all of which he denied through his lawyer before Ailes' death in 2017).\n\nYet Ailes was not the only prominent Fox figure accused of sexual harassment. Top prime-time host Bill O'Reilly was bought out of his contract by Fox in the spring of 2017 after The New York Times detailed the scope of multiple sexual harassment allegations against him for which he agreed to pay settlements totaling approximately $45 million to quiet them; the host Eric Bolling was fired after being accused of sending unsolicited sexually explicit texts to several female colleagues; and other top executives were ushered out as having facilitated or tolerated such behavior. A midlevel Fox News executive, Francisco Cortes, was also fired in 2017 after being accused of sexually assaulting a former Fox News contributor.\n\nO'Reilly, Bolling and Cortes have each denied any wrongdoing. A judge this week dismissed Cortes' allegations contained in a lawsuit against 21st Century Fox that it fired him and leaked news of the accusation to scapegoat him as a public relations ploy.\n\n21st Century Fox and Fox News say the removal of those executives and a raft of new procedures show the network's commitment to offering a fair and welcoming workplace for women.\n\nThe Ailes and O'Reilly sexual harassment scandals inspired further revelations about related accusations against powerful figures across numerous media institutions, including NPR, which fired two male news executives last fall.\n\nCurrent and former Fox News Washington journalists characterize the Washington bureau as retaining something of a Mad Men ethos, with some male reporters frequently sending racy \"topline\" notes through the network's internal messaging service.\n\nThe accusations against Rosen, who is married with young children, are more severe than that. He developed a reputation as a talented and ambitious journalist called \"the professor\" on the air by former political anchor Brit Hume for his interest in Watergate (Rosen wrote a book focusing on the life of former Attorney General John Mitchell that argued for a kinder reassessment of his role in that Nixon-era scandal). Rosen has sent such messages, according to his former female co-workers. But in three instances he made overt physical and sexual overtures, according to the accounts of numerous former Fox News colleagues who heard about the incidents contemporaneously.\n\nIn the winter following the September 2001 terrorist attacks, a female Fox News reporter joined the bureau from New York. In a shared cab ride back from a meal, Rosen groped her, grabbing her breast. After she rebuffed his advance, Rosen sought to steal away her sources and stories related to his interests in diplomacy and national security. That's according to four colleagues who say she relayed the episode as a warning about Rosen's behavior. The reporter declined to comment for this story. (NPR has decided not to name the women in this article as they have not granted permission to do so.)\n\nIn a subsequent episode several years later, a female producer covering the State Department alleged that Rosen had directly sexually harassed her. A foreign national, she subsequently accepted a deal from Fox that enabled her to extend her stay in the U.S. in exchange for not making her complaint public, according to several of her former colleagues. The producer, who now works for a foreign-based news organization, is abroad with family and did not respond to several detailed messages left by email and phone seeking comment.\n\nLate last spring, Rosen turned his attention to a younger female reporter, according to two colleagues who say she told them of the incident shortly afterward. Returning from a lunch together, Rosen physically tried to kiss her in the elevator ride back to the office, and once refused, attempted forcibly to kiss her again. According to a colleague, he then asked the reporter to keep the approach quiet and offered her unsolicited help in getting more time on Bret Baier's nightly political newscast, Special Report. The female reporter declined to comment for this story.\n\nFox News executives say privately it takes time to reverse problems in a culture set from the top by Ailes.\n\nUnder a new top human resources executive, Fox News last summer placed a human resources employee in the bureau for the first time. In response to detailed questions, Fox News declined to comment on its Washington bureau or Rosen beyond affirming his departure.\n\nYet some female employees at Fox's D.C. bureau say the company seemed late to turn its attention southward from its main headquarters in New York City, given the Ailes scandal. The bureau is a large outpost and a mainstay of the network's coverage. Its reporters, producers and hosts serve up stories, segments and shows that help fuel Fox programming throughout the day and evening.\n\nAnd employees interviewed pointed to earlier related incidents in D.C. The former Fox News correspondent Rudi Bakhtiar alleged that she was dismissed in 2007 after she made complaints that the new Washington bureau chief, Brian Wilson, had propositioned her. After she filed an internal complaint, Fox's Ailes informed her she was being let go because of her performance. She was paid an undisclosed sum in a private settlement.\n\nIn another instance, Catherine Herridge, a former Fox weekend host who is now a Washington-based national security correspondent for the network, made a range of allegations in a November 2010 complaint filed with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission \u2014 including sexual and age discrimination, unequal pay, and job retaliation for raising complaints internally. She alleged she had been subjected to a \"glass ceiling.\" She also said that Fox News general counsel Dianne Brandi had conducted the internal investigation even though she was one of the people identified in Herridge's complaint.\n\nThe EEOC said it did not have sufficient evidence to support many of Herridge's accusations but ultimately sued Fox News, alleging it had unlawfully retaliated against her. The suit was dismissed. Herridge and Fox signed a new contract and she remains on the air.\n\nBrandi, then the network's top lawyer, characterized the EEOC's suit as \"politically motivated.\" Brandi is now on extended leave from Fox News, which is the focus of an ongoing criminal inquiry by federal prosecutors for its handling of payments to women who alleged sexual harassment there.\n\nRosen's departure was a surprise \u2014 with no celebration of his achievements on the air, no announcement to viewers, nor much warning to colleagues. He had attended a holiday party for Baier's show, Special Report, just a few days earlier.", "keywords": ["according", "bureau", "washington", "female", "reporter", "left", "network", "james", "dc", "harassment", "colleagues", "rosen", "ailes", "fox", "sexual", "claims"], "polarity": 0.08188963813963812, "subjectivity": 0.3384441946941949},

Carlson found a way around that by suing Ailes personally in court.\n\n\"She and her attorney found a creative way around her arbitration agreement so that she could make her story public, and obviously that led to a lot more dominos falling,\" Martin says.\n\nCarlson's co-workers might never have come forward had Carlson not had the will, resources and high profile to take her case public, Martin says.\n\nCarlson's case is unique in many ways. But, Martin says, the outcome would have been very different if Fox had been able to keep Carlson isolated by enforcing the arbitration agreement and its confidentiality provisions.\n\nThe worry is that such scenarios could happen routinely, if the Supreme Court sides with employers, which many legal experts believe is likely.\n\n\"The problem with private arbitration, especially when you have to go it alone, is that you cannot share information, facts that you would otherwise get in a discovery of a regular case,\" says Catherine Ruckelshaus, general counsel of the National Employment Law Project, a workers' rights group.\n\n\"If you lose the ability to show the pattern in practice, then the patterns and practices are going to continue,\" she says.\n\nEmployment arbitration agreements are increasingly popular, as employers try to keep cases out of court. The liberal-leaning Economic Policy Institute estimates as many as 60 million American workers have signed one, even if they didn't read the fine print.\n\nIf so many workplace disputes are funneled into private, individual arbitration agreements, many employers will face less scrutiny and have less incentive to change their systemic problems, says David Lopez, former general counsel for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. He says that is clear from the cases that are coming out now.\n\n\"You would've been able to address these issues out of the box instead of to bottle it up confidentially and allow it to happen time and time again,\" he says.\n\nBut employers say individual arbitration isn't harmful to workers.\n\nChristopher Murray, an Indianapolis employment attorney, says most employers don't have \"any interest in silencing; I don't see that as a mission of a typical employer.\" He says employers have every incentive to want to get rid of serial harassers in their workplace.\n\nAnd some attorneys who represent employers say that sexual harassment cases in particular are hard claims to resolve collectively.\n\nUnlike wage claims, which might involve identical circumstances for many workers, incidents of harassment are often one-on-one interactions. Because every incident is different, the evidence, circumstance and damages can also be different.\n\n\"The nature of a sexual harassment claim is incredibly fact-specific,\" says Wendy Coats, another management-side attorney.\n\nAlso, because those claims are so personal, often confidentiality benefits the worker, as well as the employer, she says. And confidentiality doesn't apply until the person is in arbitration, or has reached a settlement.\n\nCoats says she doesn't believe a Supreme Court ruling in favor of employers would deal a setback to victims coming forward and finding solidarity with their co-workers.\n\n\"The arbitration agreements don't keep people from saying to people around them that they have a complaint, or coming forward to HR and complaining,\" she says.", "keywords": ["limit", "workers", "employment", "supreme", "court", "arbitration", "harassment", "say", "employers", "workplace", "ruling", "advocates", "martin", "forward", "claims"], "polarity": 0.15877598926894704, "subjectivity": 0.46281715936645507},

History Shows Otherwise\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Kevin Dietsch/Pool/Getty Images Kevin Dietsch/Pool/Getty Images\n\nDuring an interview Monday night on Fox News, White House Chief of Staff John Kelly said that \"the lack of the ability to compromise led to the Civil War.\"\n\nHis comment was swiftly countered by confounded observers, who pointed out that the Civil War was fought over slavery and that compromising on slavery would be morally unconscionable \u2014 and that the country did strike such compromises for decades and they did not, in fact, prevent war.\n\nKelly's remarks came after host Laura Ingraham asked about a church taking down historical plaques, implicitly raising the larger issue of the removal of Confederate statues and monuments across America. (The exchange begins around the 5:27 mark in the video.)\n\nWatch the latest video at video.foxnews.com\n\nKelly said he thought applying contemporary standards of ethics to the past is \"very very dangerous\" and demonstrates \"a lack of appreciation of history.\" He praised the \"men and women of good faith on both sides\" of the Civil War who followed their \"conscience\" in their fight.\n\nThe chief of staff also praised Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee as an \"honorable man.\" (This summer, The Atlantic's Adam Serwer wrote a thoughtful analysis and debunking of the mythos surrounding Lee.)\n\nAfter Kelly's remarks, scores of commentators responded with rebuttals, their tone ranging from bafflement to shock to weary repetition.\n\nJohn Podhoretz, the conservative editor of Commentary magazine, wrote on Twitter, \"80 years leading up to the Civil War were a history of efforts to compromise with the South. And then the war came. Started by the South.\"\n\nAs Vann Newkirk, a writer at the Atlantic, put it succinctly, \"the entire fabric of American law was a compromise with slavery.\"\n\nThe idea that the Civil War was caused by a failure to compromise was expressed by historian Shelby Foote in Ken Burns' 1990 documentary The Civil War. Foote, who once wrote that he \"would fight for the Confederacy today if the circumstances were similar,\" was criticized by fellow historians for, as The New York Times put it, playing down \"played down the economic, intellectual and political causes of the Civil War.\"\n\nBriefly: The history of antebellum America is full of concessions over the question of slavery, including several pivotal agreements with \"Compromise\" in the name.\n\nThe Three-Fifths Compromise in 1787 determined that enslaved black people would count as 3/5 of a person for purposes of representation (while not counting as human at all, in terms of their own rights). The Missouri Compromise in 1820 maintained the balance between slave states and free states. The Kansas-Nebraska Act later replaced that compromise with a different negotiated deal, leaving the question of slavery up to individual states.\n\nThe Compromise of 1850, a painstakingly negotiated package of bills, prohibited the slave trade in Washington, D.C., but also compelled Northerners to return fugitive slaves from the South to the owners they had escaped from.\n\nEach of these deals perpetuated the institution of slavery \u2014 prompting some to ask if Kelly was suggesting that America should have permitted slavery to continue in the name of compromise.\n\n\"Compromise on what?\" asked Joshua Zeitz, a historian and the author of Lincoln's Boys, asked on Twitter. \"Extending chattel slavery throughout the western territories?\"\n\n\"The only compromise on the table in 1861 would have given slavery explicit constitutional protection,\" writes Jamelle Bouie, chief political correspondent at Slate.\n\n\"Focus on compromise only makes sense if you view slavery as bad but not *that* bad,\" Bouie later wrote.\n\nAuthor Ta-Nehisi Coates, in a widely shared thread on Twitter, said that the historical inaccuracy of Kelly's statement extends further than ignoring the actual, explicit \"compromises.\"\n\n\"Lincoln's own platform was a compromise. Lincoln was not an abolitionist. He proposed to limit slavery's expansion, not end it,\" Coates writes. \"During the Civil War, Lincoln repeatedly sought to compromise by paying reparations \u2014 to slaveholders \u2014 and shipping blacks out the country.\n\nAnd after the war was over, he notes, the Compromise of 1877 \"led to explicit White Supremacist rule in the South for a century ... As historian David Blight pointed out \"compromise\" with white supremacy was how the country achieved reunion.\"\n\nCoates also directly rebutted Kelly's assertion that \"we make a mistake ... when we take what is today accepted as right and wrong and go back 100, 200, 300 years or more ... and apply it back then.\"\n\nThe \"notion that we are putting today's standards on the past is, in itself, racist \u2014 implies only white, slave-holding, opinions matter,\" Coates writes. \"Majority of people living in South Carolina in 1860 were black \u2014 they did not need modern white wokeness to tell them slavery was wrong. Majority of people living in Mississippi in 1860 were black. They knew, in their own time, that enslavement was wrong.\"\n\nIn the interview, Kelly also said he stands by his comments about Rep. Frederica Wilson, the congresswoman he accused of bragging during a memorial for fallen FBI officers about funding she obtained for an FBI building. Video footage showed that Kelly's allegations were false.\n\nAfter Ingraham played a montage of clips, omitting the praise Wilson gave others and highlighting moments when she used the word \"I,\" Kelly said he didn't want to explain exactly what he was referring to with his allegations \u2014 \"Don't want to get into it,\" he said \u2014 but that he does not feel any need to apologize for them.", "keywords": ["kellys", "wrote", "john", "shows", "history", "civil", "south", "war", "slavery", "lack", "caused", "white", "claims", "compromise", "kelly"], "polarity": 0.012506231142594776, "subjectivity": 0.4070493900039354},

The Murdochs signed O'Reilly to a contract extension a month after their star host agreed to the secret payout \u2014 and despite knowing of at least four earlier instances in which he settled with women over sexual harassment dating back to 2004.\n\n\"Nobody pays $32 million to anybody for false accusations,\" former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson told HLN.\n\n\"It's shocking and it's disturbing,\" former Fox News host Megyn Kelly said on her new NBC Today show program.\n\nAll three Murdochs \u2014 Rupert and his sons Lachlan and James \u2014 have made pledges to reform the culture of Fox News. The late Roger Ailes, the propulsive force behind Fox News, was bought out as chairman last year after Carlson, Kelly and others accused him of sexual harassment. A host of network executives were forced out over the ensuing year for their ties to Ailes and perceptions they had enabled abusive behavior. The Murdochs paid O'Reilly $20 million to leave in the spring after several previously unknown settlements with women came to light. The network also forced out host Eric Bolling.\n\nAnd yet Kelly devoted the opening minutes of her Monday morning show to an extended argument that Fox had not done enough.\n\nOn her show, Kelly just about set out a roadmap for prosecutors, arguing Fox had betrayed a pattern of hiding allegations through payments and threats, and retribution against those women who spoke up. \"This has to stop,\" Kelly said on NBC. \"The abuse of women, the shaming them, the threatening, the retaliation, the silencing of them after the fact.\"\n\nO'Reilly's spokesman, Mark Fabiani, sent a statement to NPR calling the Times' reporting a \"diatribe ... designed to embarrass Bill O'Reilly and to keep him from competing in the marketplace.\" The statement also repeated O'Reilly's frequent claim that no co-worker has ever filed a complaint against him with the network's human resources or legal divisions. O'Reilly also released handwritten thank-you notes from Carlson and Kelly, and claimed he had helped them throughout their careers.\n\n\"Any fair-minded person can start to formulate a picture here,\" O'Reilly said on former Fox News host Glenn Beck's radio show Monday. \"All I can hope for is that the American people will see that this is an attack on me for political purposes. It has done enormous damage to me and my family.\"\n\nCarlson and Kelly have both questioned the sincerity of the network's past human resources and legal officials. Kelly also pointed to Fox's chief publicity executive, Irena Briganti, as a corporate enforcer. (21st Century Fox issued a brief statement backing Briganti, saying she was a valued colleague who had the company's full support.)\n\nIn a draft of a lawsuit, former Fox News legal analyst Lis Wiehl alleged O'Reilly had sexually harassed her over an extended period, sent her gay pornography, and that they had a \"nonconsensual sexual relationship.\" That troubling phrase was not further defined. O'Reilly agreed within weeks to the $32 million settlement, the Times reported. Wiehl signed an affidavit attesting she had no complaints against either O'Reilly or Fox News.\n\nOfficials for 21st Century Fox released a statement hailing the changes at Fox News and saying it was not aware of the amount of money involved in the settlement. The Murdochs were aware, however, of the nature of Wiehl's allegations when they re-signed O'Reilly to a new multi-year contract with a raise. The company said any network would have done the same given O'Reilly's position. (He was the top rated figure in cable news for years before his departure.)\n\n\"I've never heard of two employees reaching their own agreement and then the employer turning a blind eye to how much it was settled for,\" said employment lawyer Douglas Wigdor, who is representing 22 people suing Fox News for a variety of charges. He won a confidential settlement from O'Reilly last year for Fox News commentator Juliet Huddy after she alleged the host had sexually harassed her.\n\nAs the Times also reported, the general counsel for parent company 21st Century Fox, Gerson Zweifach, warned his colleagues that he might have to disclose the settlement between O'Reilly and Wiehl. He wrote in an email that federal prosecutors would view that development as relevant to their investigation. Prosecutors have asked questions about activities of the network's former president, chief attorney, financial officer, and the current public relations chief, according to two people knowledgeable about the process. It appears intent on probing the extent of actions taken by Fox officials toward women who say Ailes sexually harassed them.\n\nIn addition, 21st Century Fox is fighting in the U.K. for regulatory approval of the takeover of the more than 60 percent of the European satellite television company Sky that it does not already control. The value of the deal stands currently at more than $15 billion. But the British culture minister has delayed and expanded the review process, due to the sexual abuse scandal, the network's handling of the Seth Rich story, and incidents of illegality and bribery at the Murdochs' newspapers in that country.\n\nRegulators are now assessing more broadly the family's leadership. The Murdochs rewarded O'Reilly with a new contract and a raise after learning of the Wiehl settlement. That suggests the Murdochs were willing to give O'Reilly a sixth chance on sexual harassment, just six months after ousting their chairman for the same transgression.", "keywords": ["host", "secret", "murdochs", "21st", "bill", "payout", "women", "headache", "oreilly", "fox", "sexual", "century", "settlement", "fresh", "kelly", "raise"], "polarity": 0.06444023569023569, "subjectivity": 0.3715446127946127},

And yet his meaningless misstep was far from the week's most awkward moment.\n\nIn the space of just a few days, Kelly managed to alienate two celebrity guests \u2014 one of whom is a star in a sister NBC show. Otherwise, Kelly relentlessly pumped the network's shows and leveraged human interest segments as vehicles for promoting corporate sponsors, and sought to stress her role as a working mom.\n\nIt's fundamentally unfair to evaluate a show with any finality based on its first few episodes. Yet one should be able to get a sense of where it thinks it is headed. At the moment, the show is a bit of a jumble because of the profound transformation the host is attempting to make in the public eye.\n\nThere's no reason why Kelly cannot ultimately evolve from cable news inquisitor to morning show companion. And her initial ratings have been adequate, though far from spectacular. Yet it's not precisely clear yet why the audience will feel compelled to make it a habit to tune in.\n\nMorning show hosts are typically ingratiating confidants, blending newsy segments, celebrity interviews and more personal obsessions. They tend to appeal to female viewers, and women of color often represent a disproportionate slice of the audience.\n\nKelly made her mark as the keenly focused former attorney drilling down on political matters on Fox News's prime time. As a rule, Fox tends to drum empathy out of its biggest stars, except when useful for ideological or partisan purposes. Kelly tended to play to the right-leaning home team, but that said, she showed notable flashes of independence, especially when it involved matters of gender.\n\nIn August 2015, Kelly burst into total national consciousness with her tough-minded questioning of a presidential candidate at a Republican primary debate. Her question included this pungent lead-in: \"You've called women you don't like fat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals ...\"\n\nThat candidate turned his ire on her for months \u2014 and is now president.\n\nKelly left for NBC and has been eager to proclaim a new chapter and to shed Fox News, where she alleged she had been harassed by the channel's founder, the late Roger Ailes. (He had been privately advising Donald Trump during the primaries from his offices at Fox.)\n\nIn fact, Kelly recently declared she wanted to be done with politics. Yet it can be hard to draw clean lines, as we've just learned from White House attacks on NFL players' protests over episodes of police brutality toward black citizens. (Kelly told an audience member that she felt, as an attorney, both the players and the White House should have the First Amendment right to say what they thought.)\n\nNBC brought over Kelly with great fanfare and a big payday, reportedly well in excess of $15 million a year. She's also fronting a Sunday night newsmagazine meant to compete with CBS' 60 Minutes.\n\nThe appeal of the job, however, is found in her new plum role on NBC's Today show franchise. She is now host of its 9 a.m. hour. This week, her first episodes duly whipped up her audiences for NBC's Saturday Night Live, Will & Grace and the newest installation in the Law & Order juggernaut. The true-crime miniseries focuses on the Menendez brothers, who made national headlines for killing their parents a generation ago. Kelly gamely conducted a phone interview with one of the brothers from the prison in which he resides and asked whether he experiences joy in his life.\n\nNot all her interviewees this week experienced joy.\n\nHollywood stars Jane Fonda and Robert Redford joined Kelly to talk about their new movie. It was, for once, not an NBC corporate promotion, just an old-fashioned celebrity interview. Given the longtime liberal activism of each of the actors, Fox News would have been unlikely to approve such a booking. And Kelly stayed away from politics. She seemed to be trying to connect as a professional woman, starting by praising Fonda: \"You've been an example to everyone in how to age beautifully and with strength.\"\n\nAnd then it went off the rails, as Kelly inquired about Fonda's plastic surgery: \"I read that you said you felt you're not proud to admit you've had work done. Why not?\"\n\nFonda shot back, \"We really want to talk about that?\"\n\nYouTube\n\nThe audience laughed, but it masked a withering look from Fonda. Fonda later told Entertainment Tonight Canada that she was a little shocked by the question \u2014 wrong time, wrong place.\n\nWill & Grace star Debra Messing told a fan on Instagram she regretted participating in interviews on Kelly's show, because of Kelly's joke that a superfan had become gay after watching the gay-themed show.\n\nLet's not overlook the elephant in the room.\n\nGhosts of Fox News and its ideology hover over Kelly. That heritage is in some way part of her appeal to NBC News Chairman Andrew Lack. He is mindful of sister station MSNBC's liberal leanings and wanted to ensure that red state America would feel comfortable watching NBC News' most profitable program.\n\nYet in TV, as in Faulkner, the past is never quite dead.\n\nKelly infamously insisted both Jesus Christ and Santa Claus were white.\n\nAnd she found other ways to play to Fox's die-hard viewers. In 2010, she devoted hours of coverage to the threat posed by a tiny black hate group over voter intimidation that did not appear to intimidate any voters.\n\nWhen Trump attacked her over the August 2015 debate, she became a lightning rod for criticism by conservatives, too. Now both sides are smacking her down for various elements of the week. Liberals snarked online over what they contend was a gaffe for her remarks on the Will & Grace fan. A conservative site founded by Fox's Tucker Carlson, The Daily Caller, denounced her for being insufficiently impressed with America's progress on gender equity. (Rather than a political stance, Kelly's remarks came off as an effort to connect with her predominantly female audience.)\n\nFrom a television standpoint, however, the questions involve authenticity, connection and the logic of the show itself.\n\n\"It's been very exciting. It has been educational. I have been so delighted at the media response \u2014 no,\" Kelly said, stopping herself as the audience laughed. \"But the viewer response has been awesome.\"", "keywords": ["room", "kellys", "elephant", "authenticity", "nbc", "fonda", "audience", "week", "nbcs", "fox", "episodes", "youve", "megyn", "kelly"], "polarity": 0.07412899673425989, "subjectivity": 0.45414521151363246},

The network withdrew the story a week later, saying it did not meet standards, but it failed to explain why.\n\nLate Monday night, attorneys for Fox News and reporter Malia Zimmerman argued Wheeler's quotations resemble those he made elsewhere.\n\n\"In truth, he was neither misquoted nor defamed,\" contends the brief submitted on behalf of Fox and Zimmerman. \"He made substantially the same statements on the air in several on-camera interviews, before and after the Fox News report, and even stated publicly that the article he now challenges as false 'was essentially correct and worthy of further investigation.' \"\n\nNPR has reviewed a taped recording of a three-way conference call that included Wheeler and Zimmerman on the day of the story. In that conversation, Zimmerman concedes Wheeler never made the quotes linking Rich to the leak of emails to WikiLeaks.\n\nHere's the twist: Wheeler, a former Washington, D.C., homicide detective, had also been a paid Fox News contributor since 2005. Fox is insisting that Wheeler should be subject to binding arbitration, subject to the terms of his contract as a commentator for the network, which paid him $515 per appearance. And indeed his contract does specify private arbitration to settle disputes.\n\nThat casts fresh light on a question that has sparked criticism from the day the story first surfaced: In what role was Wheeler acting?\n\nTo Fox's readers and viewers, Wheeler appeared to be a source for Zimmerman's story. Indeed, Wheeler was the only one mentioned by name. Although his connection to Fox was disclosed, he was cited for his role as an investigator hired to help Rich's parents solve the mystery of who killed their son. A spokeswoman for Fox News says that Wheeler was paid as a commentator for his two appearances on the evening of May 16 talking about the Rich story on Sean Hannity's show and Lou Dobbs' program on Fox Business. However, Wheeler was not compensated for his extensive involvement in Zimmerman's original digital piece that morning (including the disputed quotations). Wheeler's attorney, Doug Wigdor, confirms that sequence. \"We are suing for defamation for what was written in the article, not what he said on air,\" Wigdor tells NPR.\n\nWheeler had been selected and paid for the Riches by another Fox News commentator, though an unpaid one, named Ed Butowsky. He is a Dallas investment manager and supporter of President Trump's who worked behind the scenes to try to link Rich to the leak of the Democratic emails as a way of deflecting criticism of the president. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded the Russian government commissioned the hacking of the Democratic National Committee's emails to aid Trump's candidacy.\n\nWigdor says the move for arbitration is an attempt to get the botched Rich story out of public view, which he contended raised questions about the network's \"broadcast standards.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, they're trying to litigate this case under a veil of secrecy,\" Wigdor tells NPR. \"They're willing to go so far as trying to use an arbitration agreement that covers his role as a contributor, to make an argument that it should cover his role as an investigator for the Rich family \u2014 for which he was paid by Ed Butowsky.\"\n\nWheeler also sued Butowsky, whose lawyers contend he was not party to editorial decisions made by Fox News. Butowsky also argued he is not subject to the federal court's jurisdiction in Manhattan because he lives in Texas.\n\nFox is facing Wigdor in more than 20 other cases. The employment lawyer unveiled another lawsuit Monday evening: The conservative commentator Scottie Nell Hughes alleged that Fox Business Network host Charles Payne raped her in 2013 and that he kept her in a relationship for two years with a threat of violence and the promise to advance her career. That aid stopped, according to the suit, when she finally broke off ties in 2015.\n\nWigdor then alleges that Fox retaliated against Hughes when she raised concerns earlier this year; her lawsuit alleges her name was leaked to the National Enquirer in retribution by Fox's general counsel and chief publicity executive. Payne acknowledged what he called an extramarital affair to the Enquirer. Fox took him off the air during a review by its outside lawyers but returned him to his show earlier this month after concluding that Payne and Hughes had a consensual relationship.\n\nFox News labeled the lawsuit \"a publicity stunt\" without merit; a lawyer for Payne said he would be vindicated.\n\nThese accusations play out against the backdrop of a succession of breathtaking accusations against Fox News that have led to major changes there. Allegations of sexual harassment lodged in the past 14 months led to the departures of the late Fox News founder Roger Ailes and star hosts Bill O'Reilly and Eric Bolling, as well as other executives and staffers accused of enabling such behavior.\n\nNBC's Matt Lauer grilled O'Reilly on the Today show Tuesday morning over the accusations O'Reilly faced, without nailing him down. O'Reilly, who was paid millions of dollars to buy out his contract this past spring, said that no one had ever complained about his behavior \u2014 though he specified there had been no complaints to his employers' human resources departments.

{"title": "No Apology, No Explanation: Fox News And The Seth Rich Story", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2017/09/15/551163406/fox-news-has-yet-to-explain-what-what-wrong-in-seth-rich-story", "text": "No Apology, No Explanation: Fox News And The Seth Rich Story\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Spencer Platt/Getty Images Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n\nOn Monday, lawyers for Fox News must submit court filings addressing how the network mishandled a story about the unsolved killing of a young Democratic Party staffer named Seth Rich.\n\nAssuming Fox answers those questions in any detail, it would be the first time the network has done so publicly.\n\nFox News was compelled to retract the story, which involved presidential politics, international intrigue and a man's murder.\n\nWhen a story of this scale crumbles, most news organizations feel obligated to explain what happened and why.\n\nNot so far at Fox, which stands apart journalistically from its competitors in many ways. Unlike the other networks or major newspapers, for example, Fox has no office or executive dedicated to standards and practices. That falls within the larger portfolio of the network's general counsel, Dianne Brandi.\n\nAnd that gap is reflected in the response to the Rich story as well. In the four months since its retraction, Fox News has not apologized for what it reported. Nor has it explained what went wrong.\n\nSo let's try to derive our own lessons about what happened \u2014 not as a legal matter, but as a journalistic one.\n\nLesson No. 1: Investigative reports should be ironclad.\n\nAn investigative piece on a tragedy that caused such anguish for a family not used to being in the public eye, doubly so.\n\n\"With a family at stake, the journalistic rule, like the medical rule, is first, do no harm,\" said Tom Bettag, the former executive producer of CBS Evening News and ABC's Nightline during the Ted Koppel era.\n\nRich's parents say the Fox piece devastated them. \"It was like burying Seth all over again,\" Mary Rich, his mother, tells NPR. \"And we need to stay focused on finding his murderers.\"\n\nOn the morning of May 16, Fox News posted a story on its website by Malia Zimmerman, one of its investigative reporters. She reported that evidence showed Seth Rich had secretly shared the emails of Democratic Party leaders with WikiLeaks at the height of last year's presidential campaign. Those emails knocked Hillary Clinton's campaign off stride.\n\nZimmerman's story was amplified by popular Fox News shows, such as Fox & Friends, as well as prime-time programs led by Fox's Sean Hannity and Fox Business' Lou Dobbs. Several personalities called Zimmerman's report a bombshell. The Fox story revived conspiracy theories that whipped through more extreme conservative media outlets that sought to discredit growing suspicions the Russians were behind the hack of the DNC.\n\nBut those conspiracy theories remained as groundless after the Fox story as before it.\n\nLesson No. 2: Make sure your sources are saying what you think they're saying.\n\nIn this case there was just one named source: Rod Wheeler, a private eye who had been hired on behalf of Rich's family to investigate his death.\n\nFox News quoted Wheeler confirming that Rich had shared emails with WikiLeaks. Yet Wheeler immediately denied it. And last month Wheeler sued Fox for defamation.\n\nBefore the story ran, Zimmerman sent Wheeler a draft with quotes she intended to attribute to him. NPR has seen a transcript of the texts from Zimmerman calling his attention to that email. But there's zero evidence Wheeler ever said those words or gave permission for her to use them.\n\nAnd if Zimmerman did invent the quotes, that's a big problem \u2014 regardless of whether Wheeler gave her the green light.\n\n\"It's very easy to lead a witness,\" Bettag says. \"It's a dirty rotten thing to do. You can get people into a lot of trouble saying things they didn't mean to say.\"\n\nLesson No. 3: Make sure each of your sources can stand on its own.\n\nA Dallas investment manager and Trump supporter named Ed Butowsky helped to orchestrate the Fox News story. Butowsky was the one who suggested to the Riches that they should hire a private investigator. He picked Wheeler to work for the Riches. Butowsky paid Wheeler too.\n\nBoth Butowsky and Wheeler were longtime Fox News commentators. (Butowsky was unpaid; Wheeler was paid per appearance.)\n\nAnd Butowsky fed tips to Wheeler and Zimmerman, the Fox reporter, as he sought to link the dead man to the leaked emails instead of hackers working on behalf of the Russians. It was all part of an effort, as he confided to others in conversations captured on tape and emails, to defend President Trump, whose ties to the Russians are under federal investigation.\n\n\"All of this screams potential conflict of interest,\" Bettag says. \"You have an investigator who's being hired by somebody who has a link to Fox, and the investigator himself has a link to Fox. And they have a stake in giving Fox what it wants to hear.\"\n\nIn defending its lawsuit, Fox News may well point to words Wheeler did speak the night before its story ran.\n\nWheeler told a reporter for the Fox-owned local station in Washington, D.C., that a law enforcement source had verified Rich's involvement with WikiLeaks: \"Absolutely. That's confirmed.\"\n\nBut Wheeler said in his lawsuit that source wasn't his at all. He alleged he first heard about the source days earlier from Butowsky and Zimmerman. It was their source, not his, he said.\n\nIn a three-way taped conversation that took place a few hours after the Rich story ran, Butowsky and Zimmerman conceded Wheeler had never said what her story claimed.\n\nAnd that leads us to lesson No. 4:\n\n\"Transparency and trust are the absolute lifeblood of any mainstream media organization,\" says media lawyer Charles Glasser. A former top lawyer and ombudsman (or in-house critic) for Bloomberg News, as a young attorney he once helped successfully defend Rupert Murdoch's New York Post in a case. Fox News is part of Murdoch's larger media empire, and the mogul personally oversees the network.\n\nFox withheld Butowsky's various roles in the story from its audiences \u2014 he blurred lines between benefactor, source, player and, possibly, even reporter.\n\nAnd Glasser says Fox News failed to offer transparency after the fact as well.\n\nZimmerman's story cited one other key source: an unnamed law enforcement investigator, who described an FBI forensic report about Rich's computer and offered a detailed characterization of Rich's interactions with WikiLeaks.\n\nYet the FBI tells NPR the agency has not participated in investigating the Rich case.\n\nSince the story, Fox hasn't mentioned that source again. For months, the network declined to say whether it stands by the source \u2014 or whether it has confirmed his existence.\n\nFox now says it cannot comment for this story because of Wheeler's lawsuit.\n\n\"There is a critical role that newspapers and publishers and broadcasters have to clean up the record,\" Glasser says. \"And they have an ethical responsibility as a pillar of democracy.\"\n\nThe late Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes used to boast (incorrectly) that the network had never had to retract a story.\n\nAiles told colleagues he saw corrections as a sign of weakness rather than a duty. He was forced out more than a year ago during a building sexual harassment scandal.\n\nFox News' behavior this year, in the months after the Rich story, has little recent parallel among major news organizations \u2014 especially for a story with these stakes. No apology. No explanation. And no known consequences.\n\nYet Fox's choices turn out to have repercussions for the network.\n\nThe British culture minister this week put the brakes on a $15 billion deal sought by Murdoch and his family. The Cabinet secretary, Karen Bradley, questioned whether Fox News and the Murdochs adhere to standards of fairness and accuracy.\n\nMurdoch directly controls Fox News. And the Rich story was one of the major developments influencing her decision.\n\nOne final coda: In its retraction and limited public statements, Fox News treated the story as though it only appeared on the website \u2014 as though the site were a distant cousin, hardly on speaking terms. And it characterized the story as though several million viewers had not seen it rehashed on some of Fox News' most popular shows. It was a slight, but intended, corporate sleight of hand to conceal the magnitude of the mishandling of the memory of a dead young man.", "keywords": ["zimmerman", "butowsky", "rich", "source", "network", "seth", "richs", "emails", "fox", "wheeler", "explanation", "apology"], "polarity": 0.11840092483274303, "subjectivity": 0.5207970943198216},

She has previously based her decisions on Ofcom's assessments, and while she hasn't yet made a final decision, she told Parliament in June that she was inclined to refer the deal to competition regulators.\n\n\"The proposed entity would have the third largest total reach of any news provider \u2014 lower only than the BBC and ITN \u2014 and would, uniquely, span news coverage on television, radio, in newspapers and online,\" Bradley said.\n\n\"This potentially raises public interest concerns because, in Ofcom's view, the transaction may increase members of the Murdoch Family Trust's ability to influence the overall news agenda and their ability to influence the political process and it may also result in the perception of increased influence,\" she added.\n\nThe Murdochs' decision to shut down Fox News in Britain may have been intended to reduce the likelihood that Bradley would refer the transaction to the Competition and Markets Authority and slow the deal. As Deadline Hollywood reports:\n\n\"If she seeks a competition review, then it could create problems for Fox. Reviews can take up to six months to complete, potentially putting a decision off until 2018. \"But Fox is on the hook to pay a \u00a3170 million ($219 million) dividend to Sky shareholders if the deal doesn't close by the end of the year. If the deal is scrapped, then Fox will have to pay Sky \u00a3200 million ($258 million).\n\nLast time Rupert Murdoch tried to take over Sky, as NPR's David Folkenflik reported, a bribery and phone hacking scandal scuttled the bid, leading to \"a parliamentary inquiry, the closing of their big Sunday tabloid, more than 100 civil lawsuits and the criminal convictions of several former Murdoch journalists, including an editor-in-chief.\"\n\nThis time, there has been pressure on regulators to take into account the network's scandals in the U.S.: an array of sexual harassment lawsuits, and a now-retracted story that spread conspiracy theories about the murder of DNC staffer Seth Rich.\n\nOfcom's report said it had considered the \"extremely serious and disturbing\" allegations of sexual and racial harassment at Fox News, but found that Sky would be a \"fit and proper\" holder of a broadcast license even if owned entirely by Fox.\n\nThere are also Britain-specific charges against the network, relating to its broadcasts on the day of the Brexit vote last June.\n\nOfcom says the network broke U.K. broadcasting rules that prohibit broadcasters from discussing and analyzing election and referendum issues while the polls are open. As The Guardian reports, a number of segments on Fox News that day not only discussed Brexit, they had a distinct point of view. \"I don't know why any Brit, maybe I'm just too much of a Yank, why would any Brit wanna offshore its sovereignty to Brussels?\" said one.\n\nEd Miliband, the former Labour leader and a longtime critic of Murdoch, told the Guardian that the decision to pull down the network was \"yet more proof that the Murdochs can't be trusted to own 100% of Sky.\"\n\n\"Stopping broadcasting in the U.K. changes nothing,\" Miliband said. \"Fox News in the U.S. is the Murdochs' channel, they are responsible for its broadcasting standards and the appalling racial and sexual harassment that happened on their watch.\"", "keywords": ["influence", "companys", "bid", "britain", "deal", "murdoch", "network", "scrutinizes", "buy", "decision", "day", "media", "fox", "sky", "air", "goes", "uk"], "polarity": 0.060404896421845586, "subjectivity": 0.45597928436911483},

Fox reported that Rich's computer had been linked to leaks of Democratic Party officials' emails to WikiLeaks and that his death might be connected to those leaks. Fox also reported there might have been a cover-up.\n\nButowsky had hovered behind the scenes of the story \u2014 an unnamed \"third party,\" as he was described by Fox's Sean Hannity later that night.\n\nA federal lawsuit now accuses Butowsky, a Fox News reporter and the network of concocting the story about Rich's death in an effort to help the president. Butowsky even briefed a White House official about what they had found.\n\nTaped conversations obtained by NPR capture Butowsky stressing the importance of knocking down suspicions that the Russians had a hand in President Trump's election.\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview with NPR lasting more than 2 1/2 hours, however, Butowsky denies having any agenda and rejects the lawsuit's allegations. He says he only wanted to aid others, especially Rich's family.\n\n\"I can't tell you how much time I spend helping people's lives and making them better,\" Butowsky says. For himself, he says, he has a simple imperative: \"I want to take care of my family. I want air conditioning, sofa, Wi-Fi and DirectTV. That's what I want in life.\"\n\nA closer look at the record suggests a more complicated picture.\n\n****\n\nEd Butowsky is a former senior vice president at Morgan Stanley who set up a financial advice business, Chapwood Capital Investment Management, based outside Dallas.\n\nHe has enjoyed establishing a rapport with professional athletes, counseling them on ways to avoid financial woes and sometimes entering into partnerships, as he did with former baseball star Torii Hunter.\n\nButowsky was featured prominently in a Sports Illustrated cover story and an ESPN documentary on athletes going broke. He even participated in a Web-only financial reality show called The Invested Life, produced for MSN, in which he counseled people on their finances over tennis and golf by making sweeping comparisons to the sport they were playing.\n\nButowsky also has been a vocal supporter of President Trump, on Fox, on conservative talk radio and in Breitbart News, among other outlets, largely for Trump's stance on regulations and finance.\n\nAs former White House press secretary Sean Spicer told NPR in late July, Butowsky has been a reliable public voice on economic matters for Republicans, or a \"surrogate,\" for the past seven years.\n\nGiven his profile, Butowsky has given only a relatively small number of political contributions, mostly to Republicans, though one was to Barack Obama, and he says he is not a major player. \"The idea that I'm some political activist is the strangest thing,\" Butowsky says.\n\nEven so, last summer Butowsky posted on Facebook photos of himself at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland sitting next to two of the Republican Party's most important donors, Sheldon and Miriam Adelson, in the Adelsons' suite. He posted additional pictures of Trump coming into the suite to greet supporters.\n\nButowsky held front-row seats on the Capitol grounds for Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20, surrounded by some journalists and other guests. Once a year, he says, he does interviews for a talk radio service, which secures him press credentials giving him access on Capitol Hill. Along with his appearances on Fox and Fox Business, he has contributed occasional online commentaries for Fox and articles to Breitbart News; in the past, Butowsky has also called the site's former executive chairman a friend. That's Steve Bannon, Trump's chief political strategist.\n\nMedia Fox News' Seth Rich Story Echoes Previous Problems For Owner Rupert Murdoch Fox News' Seth Rich Story Echoes Previous Problems For Owner Rupert Murdoch Listen \u00b7 3:47 3:47\n\n****\n\nAll of this serves as a backdrop to the claims Fox News and Butowsky made over the Seth Rich story.\n\nButowsky says he stumbled upon it by accident late last year, when a friend told him that WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange had confided that Rich had been the source of the thousands of emails the site posted. Publicly, Assange suggested Rich's death was linked to the emails and offered a reward for information leading to the arrest of his killer. Officials at Washington, D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department said they believed his shooting was the result of a botched armed robbery. A spokeswoman for the force reiterates that conclusion to NPR now.\n\nButowsky says he reached out to Rich's parents, who live in Omaha, Neb., to share this development of what his friend had been told.\n\n\"I didn't know anything about Seth Rich,\" Butowsky tells NPR. \"I didn't know anything whatsoever. In fact, when I told Mr. and Mrs. Rich, I thought I was actually helping a family learn something.\"\n\nBy Butowsky's account, they speak in December and he offers to pay for a private investigator when they express frustration over progress in the investigation. (Joel and Mary Rich declined, through a spokesman, to comment on their interactions with Butowsky.) Butowsky says they don't accept his offer.\n\nButowsky follows the lead, speaks five days after Trump's inauguration with the legendary investigative reporter Seymour Hersh by phone. Butowsky says he doesn't know who Hersh is and records the conversation, which he later shares with others. And the audio recording obtained by NPR shows Hersh referring to an insider source who describes an FBI report reflecting that Rich had leaked information to WikiLeaks.\n\nThe tape shows Butowsky is eager to leverage information to knock down suspicions about ties between the Russians and Trump's circle. \"The most important thing is this: ... So many people throughout Trump's four years, maybe eight years, are always going to fall back on the idea that he's not legitimate, and the Russians got him elected,\" Butowsky says to Hersh. \"This changes all of that.\"\n\nButowsky tells Hersh he will be able to resolve the question of Rich's death for his parents. \"And, second, we solve the problem about Russians are the ones that gave the emails,\" Butowsky says, \"because that did not happen.\"\n\nHersh warns Butowsky against believing anything Assange might say. You can hear Hersh also give this caution to Butowsky at the end: \"It doesn't make it true. It doesn't make it true.\" Hersh tells NPR he meant that the report might be wrong or might not exist at all.\n\nIn an interview with NPR, Hersh says he is skeptical of the official account by intelligence officials that the Russians hacked the DNC. But Hersh now says he was fishing for information from Butowsky. \"I did not talk to anybody at the FBI \u2014 not about this,\" Hersh tells NPR. \"Nothing is certain until it's proved. And I didn't publish any story on this.\"\n\nButowsky nonetheless forwards the tape of his talk with Hersh to the Riches. They say they accept his offer to pay for a private eye, which Butowsky says surprises him. And that sets off a flurry of activity.\n\nEmail exchanges shared with NPR show that Butowsky canvasses friends and associates, including people with ties to Fox News, for suggestions. He ultimately zeroes in Rod Wheeler \u2014 a former Washington, D.C., homicide detective who has been a paid Fox News contributor since 2005. He introduces Wheeler to Fox News reporter Malia Zimmerman, but, according to the lawsuit, cautions Wheeler not to mention her involvement to the Riches.\n\nPolitics Lawsuit Alleges Fox News, Trump Supporter Made Up Seth Rich Story Lawsuit Alleges Fox News, Trump Supporter Made Up Seth Rich Story Listen \u00b7 3:53 3:53\n\nOver the course of this spring, the three major figures in the Rich story \u2014 Butowsky, Wheeler and Zimmerman \u2014 confer repeatedly, as Butowsky acknowledges. (Many of the exchanges are documented in Wheeler's lawsuit.)\n\nButowsky says he was trying to help the Riches learn about their son's fate and help Wheeler win paying gigs.\n\nBy Butowsky's account, Wheeler is eager for his help to get a job with the Trump administration, preferably with the Justice Department. On April 19, Wheeler is set to meet at the Justice Department with its chief spokeswoman, Sarah Isgur Flores. In an email, Butowsky asks Wheeler to send his regards \u2014 that he knows her well.\n\nIn an email, Flores tells NPR she has not communicated with Butowsky all year.\n\n\"In early April, I and other members of my staff met with Mr. Wheeler, as we do often with political commentators, to discuss the Department's views on law enforcement issues,\" Flores writes. \"In this case, we had seen him discussing his views of the Baltimore consent decree as a former police officer on television earlier that week.\"\n\nThe next day, Butowsky takes Wheeler over to the White House to meet with Spicer. They inform Spicer about their progress in the Rich case. Butowsky says it was very short \u2014 that the briefing about the murder investigation was incidental, and that the meeting was intended to give Wheeler face time with an influential White House official to help his job prospects. Most of the conversation lingered on where to buy suits. For his part, Spicer says the meeting lasted perhaps 10 to 15 minutes. The idea of a job never comes up, according to Spicer. A lawyer for Wheeler, Michael Willemin of Wigdor LLP, says Wheeler was never seeking help for a job.\n\nAs the weeks unfold, Butowsky continues in a rolling conversation with the other two, by his account and transcripts of emails, texts and phone calls contained in Wheeler's suit. (Fox News declined to comment for this story and also declined to allow Zimmerman to comment, citing Wheeler's suit against the network, its parent company, the reporter and Butowsky.)\n\n\"There's many calls I was on with Malia and Rod,\" Butowsky says. \"Rod would call me all the time.\"\n\nIn the days before the Fox News story is broadcast, according to the lawsuit, Butowsky coaches Wheeler and Fox News hosts on how to frame the story: It undercuts the question of Russian collusion with the Trump campaign.\n\nThe story that comes out, first in a revealing tease by a local Fox-owned station in Washington, D.C., then on Fox's website, and then on Fox's most popular shows, directly connects Rich to the leak of thousands of DNC emails to WikiLeaks. And it strongly suggests a cover-up.\n\nThe Riches publicly denounce the story. Law enforcement officials challenge its conclusions. Wheeler says the quotations attributed to him in Zimmerman's digital piece were fabricated.\n\nIn a taped three-way conversation obtained by NPR, Zimmerman appears to acknowledge that Wheeler didn't say remarks attributed to him. For his part, Butowsky can be heard trying to reassure Wheeler: \"One day you're going to win an award for having said those things you didn't say.\" Both exchanges are also cited in Wheeler's lawsuit. Butowsky tells NPR he doesn't believe he said that; it is the one captured statement that he has explicitly challenged.\n\nFox News retracts the story after a week of pressure, both outside and inside the network. Wheeler sues Fox, Zimmerman and Butowsky for defamation, saying they unfairly defended Fox's reporting on the basis of his quotations.\n\nAsked why he played such a key role in the story, Butowsky appears baffled.\n\n\"As I look back, I didn't do anything,\" he tells NPR. \"If you think about it, what did I do? Nothing.\"\n\n****\n\nIn many ways, Butowsky appears to be an amiable figure in the greater Dallas landscape, brimming with bonhomie, according to people who have encountered him there. He has helped to raise money for juvenile diabetes benefits locally and served with his wife as a major fundraiser for his children's private school.\n\nThere are episodes in Butowsky's record that raise questions, however.\n\nTake his educational background. On profiles on Wikipedia and Bloomberg's executive profiles, he is listed as having received a bachelor's degree from the University of Texas. In the MSN Web reality series The Invested Life, Butowsky says, \"I went to school at Texas and I continued at Wharton,\" while a picture flashes on-screen of a younger Butowsky in cap and gown. On his LinkedIn page, Butowsky lists Texas, Ithaca College and Wharton under his education.\n\nA 2008 article in the glossy metropolitan publication D magazine bears a headline calling him \"Dallas' $3 Billion Money Manager\" and refers to his having a degree from Wharton.\n\nAll three institutions say he was present on their campuses.\n\nBut NPR did not find evidence that Butowsky has a degree from any of the three schools.\n\nIthaca College in upstate New York says he attended from 1980 to 1983. A spokeswoman for the University of Texas, Austin's business school tells NPR it has records of him attending as an undergraduate from spring 1982 to summer of 1985, but no records that he graduated. And a spokesman for the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business wrote in an email, \"Mr. Butowsky attended a non-credit Executive Education Program in 1997. According to the Penn Registrar he was not part of any Penn degree program.\"\n\nAs for that $3 billion in D magazine's headline? According to the latest industry disclosure forms, Butowsky's firm manages $244 million in investments for 396 clients.\n\nButowsky says D magazine was mistaken. The magazine's reporter must have confused the figure with how much money he had under his management earlier in his career. And the question of Wharton, as well. \"He got a lot of things wrong,\" Butowsky says.\n\nZac Crain, the D magazine senior editor who wrote the story in 2008, says the biographical material came directly from Butowsky \u2014 including the amount of money under Chapwood's management and his Wharton degree. Crain's article also says that Butowsky was Morgan Stanley's \"No. 1 guy in the nation\" for his final five years at the firm. A spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley confirms his years and title there but says she cannot corroborate that characterization.\n\n\"I was not as thorough as I could have been,\" Crain says now.\n\nAsked if Butowsky objected to the incorrect characterization of his firm's size or his educational background, Crain said that he heard praise, not complaints: \"He f****** loved it.\"\n\nOn three separate occasions, the investment analyst had federal tax liens filed against him for a total of $494,000. Butowsky tells NPR the lion's share of the liens concerned a dispute with the Internal Revenue Service over the tax treatment of options and restricted stock. Butowsky says the most recent one, filed just this year, involved his forgetting to send in a check because he was recovering from hip surgery. He says that lien lasted a day.\n\n****\n\nIn reporting this story, I spoke with Butowsky several times \u2014 finally reaching him in an epic conversation on Monday. He says that the backlash over the lawsuit against him and the ensuing news coverage have been accompanied by a real toll on him and his family.\n\nHe says that he has received death threats and that his children's car has been vandalized. And he asks me to think of him as a human being.\n\nI tell him, I do. I really do.\n\nAnd then I ask, what about the toll on the parents of Seth Rich?

MSNBC, Today and NBC Nightly News all broadcast previews of Sunday Night's big get, Kelly's sit-down last week with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nBut despite all the big headlines generated recently by allegations of untoward contact between Russian representatives and Donald Trump's campaign officials, Kelly's questions to Putin on the subject produced little besides irritated denials.\n\nAnd though the program also featured stories from correspondents Cynthia McFadden and Harry Smith, there wasn't really the kind of blockbuster, stylistic storytelling you would expect from a program trying to challenge CBS' powerhouse Sunday newsmagazine, 60 Minutes.\n\n\"I haven't seen, even once, any direct proof of Russian interference in the presidential election in the United States,\" Putin told Kelly, offering a defense he has used before when asked about allegations that Russian hackers attempted to disrupt the 2016 presidential contest.\n\nPushing back, Putin even referenced an old conspiracy theory about the U.S. intelligence services masterminding the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.\n\n\"If this theory is correct and that can't be ruled out,\" Putin told Kelly, \"then what could be easier, in this day and age, than using all the technical means at the disposal of the intelligence services and using those means to organize some attacks and then pointing the finger at Russia?\"\n\nUnless she pursued a detailed \u2014 and highly untelegenic \u2014 discussion on details linking the hacking to Russian cyberespionage teams, it would have been tough for Kelly to challenge Putin's assertions that Russian involvement could be faked.\n\nIndeed, much of Kelly's interview consisted of the anchor asking tough-sounding questions with enough wiggle room that Putin could shrug off, claim ignorance of or become indignant over the subjects at hand.\n\nOn the question of whether Russian ambassador to the U.S. Sergey Kislyak met with officials in Trump's campaign before the election, Putin gave two answers. \"There were no meetings,\" he said first. Then, when Kelly pressed with a follow-up question, he said, \"I have no idea ... I don't know the routine job of an ambassador.\"\n\nWhen Kelly asked why he hasn't asked Kislyak more recently about the alleged meetings, Putin got more irritated. \"You created a sensation out of nothing and out of this sensation, you turned it into a weapon of war against the current president.\"\n\nWhen Kelly asked about Americans who may think he's an autocratic ruler who jails dissidents and kills journalists, Putin replied, \"Russia is developing along a democratic path ... Why do you feel you have the right to ask us these questions? ... We will absolutely not accept when these sorts of things are used as an instrument of political conflict.\"\n\nAbsent questions citing specific examples of Putin's actions against journalists or political rivals, it was easy for the Russian president to talk circles around the subject. Even his astonished comment that Americans have \"lost their senses\" for thinking Russia might gather compromising information on American businessmen in his country sounded disingenuous.\n\nAfter all, why would anyone think a man who spent years as a KGB foreign intelligence officer might gather information on powerful foreign business leaders when they are in his backyard? I longed for one of the incredulous reactions 60 Minutes correspondents like Mike Wallace and Ed Bradley were famous for when an interview source told a whopper, saying \"come on\" with a look that told the viewer they weren't buying what they were just told.\n\nIn the end, the interview accomplished what Putin and Kelly needed \u2014 she got a big name for her debut episode and he got a forum to push back angrily against American media and intelligence services. But I'm not sure viewers learned much that was new.\n\nOutside of the Putin interview, Kelly introduced stories from other NBC News correspondents, including an investigation from McFadden alleging that a pharmaceutical company used fraudulent tactics to encourage the over prescription of an expensive pain killer which endangered patients while enriching the corporation. There was also a cute, if uncharacteristic, segment dubbed \"At the kids table,\" featuring children answering questions about why we're so uncivil these days.\n\nKelly announced her departure from Fox News for NBC months ago, but this was the first show she has led in her new TV home. And while the first episode of any new show is a work in progress almost by definition, Sunday Night's debut didn't reflect much of her personality.\n\nBefore leaving Fox, Kelly was known as one of the few journalists who rattled Donald Trump during his campaign for president. But even though she's been off television for much of his presidency, she didn't offer any political punditry Sunday night. Frankly, it felt as if anyone could have hosted the program.\n\nThere also wasn't much of a sense why this show should exist, outside of providing a way to introduce NBC viewers to Kelly when 60 Minutes is mostly in summer reruns. And those who remember Brian Williams' ill-fated newsmagazine Rock Center know how tough it is for a news program without an identity to succeed.\n\nThe network is also developing a 9 a.m. show for Kelly to debut later this year. Presumably, that will allow her to show a bit more personality and redefine herself outside of the Fox brand her fans know so well.\n\nStill, it was an oddly straightforward debut for a woman who was once considered the future of Fox News, now making a high-profile transition to rival NBC. She'll need to make a more distinctive mark to define herself as a rising star in this new news universe.", "keywords": ["makes", "putin", "nbc", "president", "debut", "fox", "night", "tepid", "russian", "questions", "megyn", "program", "told", "kelly"], "polarity": 0.059179644880864385, "subjectivity": 0.3249326012740646},

That fact could have been determined in minutes.\" Levander cited instances in which Block tweeted out images said to be part of the intimidation before the conversations invoked by Burstein had occurred. Fox's lawyers argued that timeline showed the tweets from Block's account did not hinge on any surveillance.\n\nIn his response, Burstein wrote Fox News' own filings provided support for his allegations. Among other elements, Burstein noted that Block said he wasn't aware of an account that his account exchanged tweets with. \"If Mr. Block is telling the truth, then someone else is responsible for these tweets,\" Burstein wrote. He also says he did not allege Block was fictional, but that he either acted on Fox's behalf or allowed others access to his account.\n\nPreviously, Tantaros had sued Fox News for what she said was sexual harassment by its former chairman, the late Roger Ailes, and former star host Bill O'Reilly, naming both men and other Fox News executives as defendants. That suit was referred to binding and secret arbitration.\n\nIn some ways, Levander's legal argument seemed most driven by Burstein's filing of yet another lawsuit in federal court, placing Tantaros' dispute in the public eye once more in a move that circumvented the confidentiality of the arbitration process. In the April suit alleging intimidation, filed before Ailes' death, Burstein sued the Fox News chairman for Tantaros again, along with other defendants, including, among others, the network's former president, Bill Shine, and its public relations chief, Irena Briganti.\n\nThe network, its parent company and all the defendants have vigorously rejected the allegations.\n\nBurstein's response Wednesday additionally stated that private investigator and former paid Fox News contributor Bo Dietl admitted this week that he was hired on behalf of Fox News last year to investigate Tantaros. Lawyers for Fox News pledged to report on that element.\n\nNPR has also sought comment from Dietl. Dietl has previously acknowledged digging into the backgrounds of former Fox host Gretchen Carlson, whose sexual harassment suit last summer led to Ailes' departure, and former Fox News producer Andrea Mackris, whose sexual harassment lawsuit against O'Reilly led to a multi-million settlement to avert a jury verdict.\n\nMultiple other women accused both Ailes and O'Reilly of sexual harassment, though both men denied all misconduct. Star host Megyn Kelly left the network for NBC News after saying that she was among those who Ailes harassed.\n\nThough Burstein's allegations seem outlandish on their face, revelations at the network over the past 11 months have shocked many of the networks' critics and even some staffers, including the disclosure that Fox secretly paid more than $3 million in 2011 to a former employee who alleged Ailes had extorted sex from her for more than two decades. The structure of that hidden payment is the part of an ongoing federal investigation of Fox News, with which parent company 21st Century Fox has pledged full cooperation.\n\nSince Ailes' departure last summer, corporate and network officials have effectively confirmed employees' fears that Ailes ordered that Fox's corridors and offices be bugged and that work devices and accounts were closely monitored. Lawyers say Fox was likely acting legally under employment law. Other Ailes advisers, since dismissed, worked in a back room at Fox devising strategies against his critics.\n\nIn Tantaros' case, Fox News outside counsel Levander argued this week that Burstein has failed in court and is instead trying to make his case in the press.\n\n\"Burstein's history of grandstanding and threatening a 'media event' betray his true intention: to pressure Fox News to accede to Tantaros' extorionate settlement demands,\" Levander wrote.

Rich was fatally shot last July in what police have called a botched robbery, and there is no evidence known publicly to suggest he shared those emails. The Rich family had publicly pleaded with Fox News and others to stop trading in such speculation absent facts.\n\n\"The article was not initially subjected to the high degree of editorial scrutiny we require for all our reporting,\" the Tuesday statement read. \"Upon appropriate review, the article was found not to meet those standards.\" The Fox News statement did not apologize or specify what went wrong or how it did so, and it did not bear the name of its author. But it promised to continue to investigate the story and provide updates.\n\nFox News star host Sean Hannity, who had pushed the theory relentlessly, said on his radio show that he retracted nothing. He also tweeted the importance of finding out the truth. On television Tuesday night, Hannity said he would no longer talk about the story \"out of respect for the family's wishes \u2014 for now.\"\n\nYet Hannity, a leading President Trump advocate and confidant, did not apologize or say the story was wrong. Instead, he pivoted to assailing the \"destroy-Trump media [and] the Democrats.\"\n\nThe public disclosure of the content of those DNC emails threw Hillary Clinton's campaign into turmoil during the 2016 election and led to the resignation of the chairwoman of the DNC, though they did not contain any extraordinary revelations.\n\nThe embrace of the conspiracy theory around Rich's death by Hannity and others caused similar tumult at Fox News this month, revealing and deepening rifts between its journalists and the opinion side that propels its economic success, according to several people at the network.\n\nThe handling of the story also exposed the tentativeness of the network's leadership after the departure of prominent and longtime executives, including former Chairman Roger Ailes and former Co-President Bill Shine. Rupert Murdoch, whose family controls Fox's parent company, is acting as the network's CEO. (Ailes, who died May 18, had been accused of sexual harassment by many women, and Shine had been accused of enabling or hiding his behavior. Both men denied those charges.)\n\nA version of the Fox News May 16 online story ran on the Fox local station in Washington, D.C., Fox 5, the night before. Journalists and executives within Fox watched with growing alarm as Hannity, the network's fixture at 10 p.m., repeatedly legitimized suspicion that Rich's death was linked to the DNC leaks.\n\nThe claim about Rich's death has also been embraced on the air by former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Fox News contributor. As far back as August, Fox host Eric Bolling compared the story to something out of the Showtime spy thriller Homeland and called Rich's killing \"a hit.\"\n\nThe May 16 FoxNews.com report claiming proof of Rich's involvement in the DNC email leaks was used by Trump defenders to deflect growing concerns on Capitol Hill and among current and former intelligence officials about the nature of contacts during the campaign between Trump's circle and figures with ties to Vladimir Putin's regime in Russia.\n\nBreitbart News and the Gateway Pundit were among the other sites that trafficked in the conspiracy theory \u2014 as did the Twitter account for the Russian Embassy in London. Yet the story had a particular Fox imprint: The May 15 Fox 5 report cited as its source a private investigator who worked for the Rich family named Rod Wheeler, who has been a paid Fox News contributor. Wheeler later said he had relied on the statement of a Fox 5 producer who had prepared him for the segment.\n\nAs it happens, Wheeler had been hired not by the Riches but by a conservative Dallas investor named Ed Butowsky on their behalf. Butowksy has appeared periodically as a commentator on Fox News and Fox Business. He had his own personality page on Fox's website until shortly after I publicly pointed that fact out last week.\n\nHannity has told others at the network that Fox needs him more than ever since last month's departure of former star host Bill O'Reilly. (O'Reilly also left after facing sexual harassment charges, which he disputes.)\n\nHannity told viewers Tuesday night that he would stay at Fox News \"as long as they seem to want me\" but cited critics who he said were trying to silence him, such as the liberal advocacy group Media Matters. Hannity called such efforts \"liberal fascism.\"\n\nYet many critics of the story could be found on the right \u2014 even among conservative voices in Murdoch's own vast media holdings.\n\nOn May 21, Seth Mandel, opinion page editor of the Murdoch-owned New York Post, tweeted: \"Why are you doing this to them? Why are you tormenting a grieving family like this? Please, Sean. Please. Stop doing this. Please.\"\n\nNew York Post columnist John Podhoretz wrote in the magazine Commentary, which he edits, that the theory is \"the unwitting catspaw of an authoritarian government in Moscow.\"\n\nPodhoretz continued: \"It should go without saying that defaming a dead man by asserting he was killed for doing something criminal is a great evil.\"\n\nAnd National Review editor Jonah Goldberg, a Fox News contributor, has been a constant thorn in Hannity's side on Twitter over the Rich story. Goldberg is the author of a book whose title is apparently familiar to Hannity: Liberal Fascism.\n\nAiles famously hated to retract any reports, arguing that it showed weakness and simply gave more fodder to the network's critics.\n\nIn the post-Ailes era at Fox News, the news side won this round, even though the retraction was grudging, lacked specificity and did not include an apology. But that victory took a full week \u2014 on a story with major national stakes involving a young man's death.", "keywords": ["staffer", "hannity", "retracts", "alive", "rich", "richs", "national", "family", "networks", "keeps", "fox", "dnc", "theory", "conspiracy", "death"], "polarity": 0.09722710833470329, "subjectivity": 0.44103731711326627},

Roger Ailes was 77. The Palm Beach County medical examiner says his death was accidental, that Ailes had fallen in his home and hit his head and that haemophilia contributed to his death. Ailes built Fox News into a powerhouse. He also built a toxic culture there, revealed as women came forward to accuse him of sexual harassment. Here is NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik.\n\nDAVID FOLKENFLIK, BYLINE: Heartfelt tributes poured in for Roger Ailes on the Fox News Channel throughout the day.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"FOX AND FRIENDS\")\n\nAINSLEY EARHARDT: Roger believed in hard work.\n\nFOLKENFLIK: This from \"Fox & Friends\" host Ainsley Earhardt.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"FOX AND FRIENDS\")\n\nEARHARDT: He ran four political campaigns. Many people out there would say that he saved this country by starting the Fox News Channel.\n\nFOLKENFLIK: He certainly saw it that way. More than any other person in this country in recent decades, Roger Ailes blurred the boundaries separating the worlds of politics and media. He emerged from producing talk shows to help lead the White House campaigns of Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush. Ailes created what became CNBC but found his patron and calling in media mogul Rupert Murdoch. Murdoch had a vision serving conservative viewers and launched Fox News in 1996. Fox News analyst Fred Barnes spoke wistfully of that time last summer, hours after Ailes was forced out of Fox. Barnes said conservatives had found a home.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)\n\nFRED BARNES: They were so used to thinking that the media was completely barren as far as they were concerned. There was nothing there for them. It was all liberals, and then Fox comes along, and they really glommed on it.\n\nFOLKENFLIK: Ailes called Fox fair and balanced and said the other news outlets weren't. He defined Fox as patriotic, implying that competing journalists didn't care about their country. Chris Ruddy is chairman of Newsmax, a rival conservative media group.\n\nCHRIS RUDDY: Roger almost single handedly built the number one TV network for cable news in the country, and he did it within three or four years.\n\nFOLKENFLIK: Instead of demanding that cable television providers pay to carry Fox News, Murdoch and Ailes initially struck deals to pay the providers, who happily took Murdoch's money. Ruddy also points to another factor.\n\nRUDDY: One of the key components of his success, I think, is that he does come from a background in politics because politics is about messaging.\n\nFOLKENFLIK: Ailes identified stories with saints and villains, saviors and victims; not so much journalistic offerings as cultural obsessions, sometimes even conspiracy theories. During the Obama years, Ailes doubled down, making Fox the home in exile for Republican politicians, hiring Newt Gingrich, John Kasich, Rick Santorum and Ben Carson, among others. Former Fox News producer Joe Muto also pointed to the coverage of a non-politician.\n\nJOE MUTO: Trump equaled the ratings.\n\nFOLKENFLIK: That, of course, would be Donald Trump.\n\nMUTO: People really went nuts for him. Every - you know, if we had him on the show, if we talked about him, if we put a video of him up on Bill's website, it got a huge response.\n\nFOLKENFLIK: And Fox repeatedly allowed Trump to offer up offensive and utterly groundless claims that President Barack Obama had not been born in this country.\n\nMUTO: They let Trump come on here and make these insane allegations, basically flat Earth allegations, and just said - and presented it as a story of balance.\n\nFOLKENFLIK: Fox presented Trump to the Republican electorate as a plausible political figure. And when Trump ran for office, Ailes routinely advised him from his offices at Fox News. It was during Trump's triumphant week at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland last July that Ailes' tenure unraveled. Former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson had sued Ailes days before alleging he punished her for rebuffing his sexual advances. Other women came forward too, star host Megyn Kelly among them.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)\n\nMEGYN KELLY: And the problem that we had at Fox, like so many other companies in America right now, was that there was not a safe avenue for reporting.\n\nFOLKENFLIK: Kelly spoke on Fresh Air with Terry Gross late last year.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)\n\nKELLY: Here was the CEO and chairman of the board on industry publications as the most powerful man in news harassing young women of the company like myself who had been there for 12 months and who typically were in a vulnerable position.\n\nFOLKENFLIK: Ailes was forced out with a $40 million pay day. He denied all the allegations, and had it not been for this scandal, Ailes' legacy would have been one largely viewed through ideological blinders. Instead, Ailes presents as a complicated figure, even to admirers. At his death, Ailes faced multiple lawsuits from former employees. And there's a federal criminal investigation of Fox News, too. It is the kind of story Roger Ailes would have given blanket coverage to had it only happened at any other network. David Folkenflik, NPR News, New York.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2017 NPR.

Eleven Fox employees\u2014current and former\u2014have filed a class-action suit. The suit says the employees made multiple complaints about discrimination and racially derogatory language from specific managers, and that the network never did anything about these behaviors. The network denies it.\n\nFar from sucking away resources from angry Americans, a new study from Latino USA says DACA-eligible immigrants provide $2 billion each year in state and local taxes.\n\nThere's a new philanthropist in town: the New York-based Robin Hood Foundation has chosen Wes Moore as its new CEO. (You may remember him as the author of, The Other Wes Moore, a book that looks at how he and another Wes Moore, grew up a block away from each other in the same poor Baltimore neighborhood, had similar beginnings and vastly different lives.) The nonprofit addresses poverty, health and education needs, and is a favorite of Wall Street types. Moore is uniquely qualified to run the charity: it's not often that philanthropic administers who are trying to reduce poverty actually know poverty on a first-hand basis. \"Disparity is real,\" Moore told The New York Times. \"We have communities that have been neglected, and I have lived in one of them.\"\n\nWhose art is it, and is it a homage or an appropriation? You'll remember artist Shepard Fairey got in trouble with his Obama/Hope poster. And earlier this year, with the hijabi that celebrated the Women's March on Washington.

That suit has been stayed while her complaints against the network are being heard in binding private arbitration. All defendants, through their own representatives or through Fox's parent company, 21st Century Fox, vehemently denied Tantaros' initial allegations.\n\nAiles and O'Reilly were both forced out of Fox News with major payouts.\n\nIn Monday's federal lawsuit, Tantaros alleges that Fox News executives including co-President Bill Shine orchestrated the use of material gathered by electronic eavesdropping that was fed to Twitter accounts acting on the network's behalf. Ensuing tweets, she says, reflected knowledge of details of intimate conversations and exchanges with family members and friends. Tantaros alleges this was done to try to undermine her resolve in challenging the network on sexual harassment.\n\n\"Fox News and its executives flatly deny that they conducted any electronic surveillance of Ms. Tantaros,\" according to a statement from the law firm Dechert LLP. \"They have no knowledge of the anonymous or pseudonymous tweets described in her complaint. This lawsuit is a flimsy pretext to keep Ms. Tantaros and her sexual harassment claims in the public eye after the State Supreme Court directed her to bring them in arbitration.\"\n\nThe case appears to build on a recent report by Salon's Matthew Sheffield. He reported that Fox News under Ailes allegedly paid for \"sock puppet\" accounts online to promote his private agendas and also covertly supported the development of blogs that sexualized the network's female hosts and anchors. Tantaros' new suit names, among others, the head of a digital media consulting company who had a prominent role in Sheffield's account.\n\nThe lawsuit also alleges that Shine used social media consultant Pete Snyder of Disruptor Capital to plant negative reaction about Chris Ruddy, the CEO and chairman of Newsmax, a rival but far smaller conservative media outfit.\n\nThe suit alleges a rise in offensive material on social media accounts directed toward Tantaros in early 2015, when, she says, she first notified Shine and other Fox News executives that Ailes had harassed her.\n\nThen in May 2016, according to the complaint, several Twitter accounts started to post material suggesting direct knowledge of her conversations.\n\nFor example, a picture of a movie about a black scorpion was posted just after she learned that a friend had been bitten by one. Another tweet invoked the idea of a memorial for Tantaros' dead brother, just after she and her mother had spoken of it; the third anniversary of his death was still a few months away.\n\nAnd at the same time that Tantaros was talking to the children of her other brother while they were at Disneyland, according to the lawsuit, a tweet on one of the accounts posted a photograph of Mickey Mouse hugging two children.\n\n\"This is not just cyberstalking,\" Tantaros' lawyer, Judd Burstein, told NPR. \"This is cyberstalking on steroids, because, as alleged in the complaint, they harassed her through sock-puppet social media accounts which conveyed the illegal fruits of their electronic surveillance of her. It was in essence two crimes committed at the same time.\"\n\nFox News and parent company 21st Century Fox have condemned Burstein's filings in the past and have attacked Tantaros as untrustworthy. They allege she ruptured her standing at the network when she published a book with HarperCollins, a corporate cousin, that had a racy cover and that her allegations of harassment by Ailes, O'Reilly and others is a ruse and a cynical effort to cash in.\n\nThe phrase \"hacking\" carries particular resonance for the Murdoch family, which controls Fox News. In 2011, a bribery and hacking scandal at their London tabloids led to the closing of a newspaper, the criminal conviction of a former editor-in-chief, millions of dollars in settlements and the loss of a potential $11 billion takeover of a big British broadcaster called Sky. The Murdochs are now back in front of a British regulator, once again attempting to take over the 60 percent of Sky they do not already control.\n\n\"Ms. Tantaros and I hope that this lawsuit will demonstrate that the Murdochs mean what they say about reforming Fox News,\" Burstein says. \"If one were cynical, the firing of O'Reilly and Ailes, particularly given the sexual predator bonuses they received, were efforts to cauterize deep wounds. But now that they are presented with misconduct and illegality that goes far beyond anything that has been reported to date, the question that everyone should be asking is, what are they going to do about it?\"", "keywords": ["digital", "accounts", "tantaros", "network", "lawsuit", "executives", "devices", "ordered", "media", "ailes", "fox", "accuser", "oreilly", "alleges", "execs", "eavesdropping"], "polarity": -0.006461038961038955, "subjectivity": 0.34233225108225107},

The broadcaster has a major presence in the U.K., Germany, Italy, Ireland and Austria.\n\nAnd yet, there is a quieter scandal hiding in plain sight \u2014 rife with allegations of computer hacking, accusations of fraud, questions of political interference and payouts totaling more than $900 million \u2014 all which centered on a relatively anonymous Murdoch enterprise called News America Marketing.\n\nThe episode that kicked off that controversy was a small one, involving a rival company that stuck advertising decals on the floor of supermarket aisles. Yet the case stirred members of Congress to demand investigations and cast an unwelcome glare on the actions of rising Republican star Chris Christie while he was a top prosecutor. The case also appears to have influenced former Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes' decision in fall 2011 to hire a Democratic strategist as an on-air commentator for Fox News.\n\nEarlier this month, the commentator, Julie Roginsky, became the latest female employee to sue Ailes and the network itself for sexual harassment.\n\nIn London, the independent British media regulator Ofcom has delayed until June 20 its deadline to determine whether the Murdochs are \"fit and proper\" owners for Sky. The Murdochs' entertainment and television conglomerate, 21st Century Fox, already owns 39 percent of Sky.\n\nThe family's last bid to take over Sky imploded nearly six years ago as outrage built over revelations of widespread bribery and phone hacking by the Murdochs' London tabloids. Over time, that scandal caused a parliamentary inquiry, the closing of their big Sunday tabloid, more than 100 civil lawsuits and the criminal convictions of several former Murdoch journalists, including an editor-in-chief.\n\nThis time, several consumer groups and anti-Murdoch politicians have pushed British regulators in official submissions to take the Fox scandals into account when gauging whether the Murdochs would be \"fit and proper\" owners of Sky.\n\nNews America Marketing is a division of News Corp., the Murdochs' newspaper and publishing arm. News Corp. was split apart from their television and entertainment holdings in 2013 as a consequence of the British tabloid scandal.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Lefteris Pitarakis/AP Lefteris Pitarakis/AP\n\nThe actions of News America have triggered a far higher cost to the Murdochs' shareholders than the Fox News sexual harassment scandals: settlements exceeding $900 million to head off a series of lawsuits filed over the past 12 years. That sum includes $280 million in payments announced in early 2016 to cut short an ongoing class-action lawsuit filed by some of its biggest clients.\n\nThe fight over decals\n\nAs the origins of this tale stretch back two decades, some key figures have died. Others cannot talk owing to legal restrictions. This story is based on interviews with more than 20 people with direct knowledge of relevant events, as well as a review of legal documents, corporate papers and correspondence involving members of Congress and their staff. NPR has also reviewed testimony from News America executives and expert witnesses that gives a flavor of the company's operations.\n\nThe story opens with the aspiration of two brothers, George and Richard Rebh. The late George Rebh was a federal disaster preparedness planner and presidential portraitist who became a salesman; Richard Rebh is a former management consultant for Bain & Co.\n\nIn the 1990s, the Rebhs and their partners founded Floorgraphics Inc., based in Princeton, N.J. The idea, basically, was to market products for shoppers on the floor. It was new, a niche carved out among larger players in supermarket advertising who controlled coupons in newspapers and direct mailing, ads on shopping carts, signs on the shelves.\n\nMurdoch's News America Marketing was and is one of the titans of the trade, reaching millions of consumers each day in stores on top of the 60 million households that received its Sunday newspaper inserts. Direct advertising to consumers in retail stores and pharmacies proved a growing area of interest as the newspaper industry started its slide.\n\nThe marketing division was led by Paul V. Carlucci, a former department store executive and bon vivant who also invested in racehorses and a pair of restaurants near the racetrack in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., and in New York City. Former associates described Carlucci as charismatic, gregarious and well-liked by employees. They also said he often played rough.\n\n\"Paul Carlucci is smart, he's charming, but he's ruthless,\" said Steve Marquis, a former vice president for retail sales development at News America Marketing.\n\n\"Paul was take-no-prisoners, win-at-all-costs. Rupert loved that,\" says Ken Chandler, the former publisher of Murdoch's New York Post.\n\nAnd Carlucci delivered results at News America Marketing, Chandler said: \"This was like a faucet that was spewing dollar bills.\" (Carlucci did not respond to detailed questions submitted through his son, Paul Carlucci Jr., a sales director at Murdoch's Wall Street Journal.)\n\nIn 1999, the Rebh brothers set up a meeting with Carlucci to discuss the industry, in an account they later set out in a lawsuit against News America Marketing. They maintained that they did not see their business model as in direct competition with News America, but living alongside it.\n\nCarlucci picked a high-end Chinese restaurant in Manhattan for the meeting, wrongly believing the brothers were preparing to sell their company to him, according to George Rebh's later sworn testimony. The proceeding was first obtained and broadcast by CNN in 2011.\n\n\"He said words to the effect: 'You should know I work for a man who wants it all and doesn't understand anyone telling him he can't have it all,' \" George Rebh testified. \" 'And know this: If you ever get into any of our businesses, I \u2014 we \u2014 will destroy you.' \"\n\nRebh testified that he took that to be a reference to Rupert Murdoch and his sons. \"So, after a couple of seconds, I said to Mr. Carlucci, 'So let me see if I understand this. You can get into our business and compete with us. But if we were to get into yours, you would destroy us,' \" Rebh told the court. \"And he said, 'That's right.' \"\n\n(In his own testimony, Carlucci denied saying he would destroy Floorgraphics.)\n\nLate that year, Marquis told NPR, he witnessed the moment when Floorgraphics graduated to being a full-fledged adversary.\n\nIn December 1999, Marquis attended a meeting with executives from the A&P supermarket chain. News America paid A&P for the right to put up ads, coupons and signs within grocery carts inside the store for its clients, which manufactured such consumer packaged goods as toothpaste, toilet paper and the like. Marquis had prepared A&P for unwelcome news: It would have to accept less money from News America.\n\nInstead, the chain's executives told him they had selected Floorgraphics. A&P gave Floorgraphics exclusive rights to mount advertising signage throughout its roughly 600 stores.\n\nFor the first time, little Floorgraphics had poached News America's bread and butter.\n\nMarquis sped back to New York City with the bad news, hustling to News America's holiday party held at a restaurant overlooking the ice rink at Rockefeller Center \u2014 just a block from parent company News Corp.'s headquarters. \"I made a beeline to Carlucci,\" Marquis recalled, \"and said, 'You'll never believe what happened.' \"\n\nCarlucci and other senior executives proved surprisingly cheery, Marquis said. \"Paul told me, 'Not only are we going to kick their asses and crush these guys, but I can go to the boss and get the money I need to put them out of business.' \"\n\n\"I was getting hugs and high-fives and being told, 'Let's get a drink!' \" Marquis recalled. \"They knew they were going to get Murdoch to kick in some dollars to go get these guys.\"\n\nMarquis left News America for Floorgraphics a few months later.\n\nFloorgraphics in a jam\n\nIn early 2005, a salesman for the Rebh brothers was taken aback. Account executives for one of their clients, the Smucker's jam company, dressed him down, demanding to know, according to documents Floorgraphics later filed in court, how News Corp. knew the terms of the contracts they had.\n\nThat information was proprietary.\n\nFloorgraphics officials searched the gateway to their computer system and their own mainframe. Someone using an IP address associated with News America Marketing in Connecticut had accessed their internal servers and files a dozen times from October 2003 to January 2004, according to information the Rebhs provided to members of Congress and later put into court records.\n\nThey had been hacked. And whoever hacked them had gained access to the smaller company's contracts and future deals.\n\nLawyers for News Corp. ultimately acknowledged in court that the hack had come from inside News America Marketing but said they could not determine who had committed or commissioned it.\n\nFor nearly two years, News America sent press releases of their big announcements, new contracts and recent hires to the homes of Floorgraphics staffers to erode morale. News Corp. hired away a significant swath of the smaller company's sales force, according to former Floorgraphics employees who spoke to NPR.\n\nPeople at the smaller company wondered if the addresses had been part of what had been hacked. In court proceedings, the Rebhs accused Gary Henderson, a former Floorgraphics executive hired away by News America, of playing the key role. Later they accused Henderson of perjuring himself during his testimony. Lawyers for News Corp. countered that he could have gotten addresses from a holiday card database. Henderson did not respond to four messages by phone and email seeking comment for this story.\n\nThe brothers complained to anyone they could commandeer on Capitol Hill and in the U.S. Justice Department. Scott Christie, who headed hacking prosecutions in the U.S. attorney's office for New Jersey, gave the green light for an investigation. When Christie departed the office for a job in the private sector, his replacement, Kevin O'Dowd, took over the case.\n\nThen Sens. Frank Lautenberg and Jon Corzine, both New Jersey Democrats, weighed in on behalf of the Rebhs. So did then-Rep. Rush Holt, D-N.J. \"I rarely write to a U.S. attorney,\" Holt recently told NPR. \"I listened and looked at what [Floorgraphics] brought and said, 'Yeah, there's some smoke here.' \"\n\nThe U.S. attorney for New Jersey at the time was Chris Christie, a Republican harboring greater political ambitions (and no relation to Scott Christie).\n\nO'Dowd soon stopped returning calls, according to an account the Rebhs later shared with congressional staffers. The Rebhs told others an assistant U.S. attorney had informed them the harm done by the hacking did not exceed $5,000 so there would be no prosecution. The two Rebhs seethed.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Rob Kim/Getty Images Rob Kim/Getty Images\n\nA spokesman for New Jersey Gov. Christie told NPR that the case was handled \"in the normal course of business,\" evaluated by two assistant U.S. attorneys with their supervisors. \"The United States attorney and his front-office staff played no role in the investigation or the decision to decline prosecution,\" said the spokesman, Brian Murray.\n\nOne lawsuit follows another\n\nThe Rebhs and Floorgraphics instead filed a civil lawsuit against News America Marketing.\n\nIn that suit, the Rebhs alleged that News America account executives undercut Floorgraphics' prices by paying grocery stores more for contracts than they were worth. They accused the News Corp. marketing division of engaging in anti-competitive practices such as demanding exclusivity in floor advertising even in stores where they weren't offering such advertising.\n\nA few days into trial, News Corp. settled with the Rebhs and Floorgraphics for $29.5 million. As part of the settlement Floorgraphics sold its floor advertising in-store business to News America. Their case was the smallest and just the first in what became a series of cases that had big-dollar price tags.\n\nLater lawsuits from competitors and clients of News America similarly alleged fraud, tortious interference, false claims and anti-competitive practices.\n\nNews Corp.'s lawyers included some of the best litigators in the country at such firms as Paul, Weiss. They played hardball, according to several lawyers; in one case, News America Marketing's suit against a fired executive, Bob Emmel, caused him to enter into bankruptcy, according to Emmel's bankruptcy lawyer, Danny Coleman. Emmel would have been unable to pay the damages the company sought.\n\nNews America contended Emmel had taken records unlawfully that he produced at his deposition for the Floorgraphics suit against the company (a claim he disputed); Emmel also had been acting as a whistleblower to tell congressional investigators about what he believed were illegal actions by the company, though News America had not known that when it fired him. Emmel later served as a witness in several other lawsuits against the Murdoch company as well \u2014 despite efforts of News Corp. to complicate his ability to participate. (Emmel referred all questions from NPR to his lawyers, as he is under court order not to comment.)\n\nIn a separate case, according to one of Marquis' former colleagues, News America's lawyers briefly threatened to compel Marquis' young son to testify against his father in an attempt to challenge his story. Marquis confirmed the threat, though he said that nothing came of it.\n\nTestimony in the cases offers insights into News America's reach and successes. The Murdoch company argued that its dominance was overstated, even if it controlled 90 percent of the market by some measures. Yet executives conceded under oath it had developed a strategy to lock in major retail stores for long-term contracts with staggered expiration dates to make it harder for other companies to get a foothold in the field.\n\nIn a November 2004 letter that became part of a court record a decade later, then-News America Executive Vice President Martin Garofalo pleaded with Jeffrey Noddle, the executive chairman of SuperValu, not to drop its agreements with News America. Garofalo promised a 400 percent annual increase in payments to keep the chain out of the embrace of a competitor.\n\nCommercial disputes happen all the time. But 900 million is a big number. At some point, you have to ask yourself, 'Is there something going on in the culture of a place?'\n\nIn April 2015, a News America executive named Christina Bedell acknowledged under oath that the company lost more than $4.2 million a year on its deal with Kmart placing ads in its stores. Another executive, Dominic Hansa, testified that the company sought to extend a long-term contract with Safeway \u2014 a major grocery retailer \u2014 simply to avoid a competitive bidding process that could have allowed others to pitch for the contract. Bedell and Hansa are now senior vice presidents; Garofalo is now News America's CEO.\n\nThough News America disputed the claim, such payments were alleged to have been anti-competitive and illegal.\n\nThe ensuing settlements would make the size of the Floorgraphics case pale in comparison: $500 million for a major competitor called Valassis; an additional $125 million for Insignia, based in Minnesota. The latest, $280 million, was incurred just a year ago to cut short a class-action lawsuit filed by News America's own clients, such as the soap manufacturer Dial and the ketchup giant H.J. Heinz.\n\nExecutives at News Corp. and News America declined to respond to a series of specific questions for this story. Jim Kennedy, News Corp.'s chief communications officer, provided a single sentence in response: \"These cases involve matters going back decades, were settled without any admission of wrongdoing and for a fraction of what was sought by claimants.\"\n\nLondon hacking revives interest\n\nThe summer of 2011 resurrected the relevance of the Floorgraphics case, as its allegations echoed the mobile phone and computer hacking scandal in Murdoch's London tabloids. Celebrities, athletes, actors and politicians in the U.K. had been seen as fair game; the revelation that a dead girl's voicemail had been hacked by people on behalf of News Corp.'s Sunday tabloid News of the World turned what had been written off as sport into outrage. British politicians who had protected the Murdoch papers for years lined up to denounce them.\n\nThe late David Carr, the New York Times media columnist, refocused attention on the Floorgraphics investigation in a pair of edgy pieces.\n\nIn the U.S., Chris Christie was by this time no longer a prosecutor but a tough-talking governor who had emerged as a favorite figure on Fox News programs. O'Dowd, who led the abortive Floorgraphics inquiry, followed Christie to the governor's office and became his chief of staff. According to New York magazine's Gabriel Sherman, then-Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes twice beseeched Christie to run against Obama in the years leading up to the 2012 race.\n\nSparked by the London hacking scandal, Lautenberg once more sought to turn attention on Christie's earlier failure to prosecute the News Corp. division. According to then-congressional aides, Lautenberg also urged colleagues, including then-Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., to hold investigative hearings.\n\nIn late August and early September 2011, Ailes stepped up talks with Roginsky, the liberal political pundit. She was something of a Lautenberg prot\u00e9g\u00e9, a Democratic strategist in New Jersey who had briefly been a paid CNBC contributor and had appeared on Fox off and on, without pay, since 2004. In November 2011, Ailes hired her.\n\nRoginsky told others that Ailes would periodically ask her to stop by his office on the second floor of the company's corporate headquarters. She described to associates one of her first such meetings with Ailes this way:\n\nAiles called over Murdoch and introduced Roginsky to his boss as a liberal, but added, \"We still love her.\" She was struck that in talking to Murdoch, Ailes invoked her links to Lautenberg, as though that gave the network chief sway on Capitol Hill.\n\nRoginsky was first introduced to viewers on the air as a Fox News contributor in February 2012, according to a review of transcripts in available databases.\n\nShe had worked for other New Jersey Democrats too, such as Jon Corzine and Rep. Frank Pallone, among others. Yet transcripts show Roginsky was identified as a former Lautenberg adviser 10 times more frequently than by ties to anyone else.\n\nOne of Ailes' former colleagues said Ailes was fixated on Roginsky's links to Lautenberg.\n\nEvery so often, Roginsky told others at the time, Ailes would call her over and ask whether News Corp. or he would be called up to testify on Capitol Hill. By her account to others, Ailes' requests mystified her: Roginsky had no insight to offer.\n\nAiles cited the Floorgraphics hacking case but, according to others, he was also anxious over a New York Times report that he might be indicted over allegations he had directed another Murdoch executive and Fox News host, Judith Regan, to lie under oath about having an affair with former New York City Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik. Concerns over that allegation may have played into Fox's decision to pay Regan $10.75 million to leave the network.\n\nIn addition, Fox News had in June 2011 also secretly arranged to pay another longtime employee more than $3 million. The network sought to keep quiet her allegations that Ailes had coerced sex from her for more than 20 years through promises of career advancement and threats to release sexually provocative videotape that Ailes had made of her. (Ailes denies the allegations of the woman, Laurie Luhn, while other Fox executives said they wrongly did not believe her at the time they arranged the settlement, according to Fox News.)\n\nFinally, Sherman, the unauthorized biographer, was poking around his record. Ailes had a lot to be nervous about at the time.\n\nRoginsky told associates she felt Ailes was trying to use her to send some sort of a signal, either to Lautenberg or to Murdoch.\n\nRoginsky sued Ailes earlier this month, alleging he promised her a role as a host on one of Fox's more popular panel shows as he sought to take her out for drinks and as he conveyed the intention of a physical relationship. When she rejected his romantic overtures, the promise vanished.\n\nRoginsky's lawyer, Nancy Erika Smith, says Roginsky never intervened in any way to aid News Corp. with Lautenberg or other lawmakers; two congressional aides who monitored the issue say there's no evidence she played any role at all.\n\nLautenberg continued trying to investigate the Murdoch company until his death in June 2013.\n\nAiles' attorney, Susan Estrich, who previously denied Roginsky's claims of harassment, now denies Ailes had any political interest in her. \"I have never heard him say he was intrigued by her at all,\" Estrich wrote in an email. \"Only that her claim is totally false.\" Fox News declined to comment for this story.\n\nChris Christie restrained his presidential ambitions until the 2016 cycle. Yet both Christie and O'Dowd saw their greater ambitions knocked off course by the Bridgegate scandal; Christie dropped out of the primaries after a sixth-place finish in New Hampshire last year, while O'Dowd's prior nomination to become state attorney general stalled. He is now a top executive at a major medical center and did not return messages seeking comment.\n\nGeorge Rebh died in 2015. His brother Richard declined to comment for this story because the deal they struck with News Corp. in 2009 included a nondisclosure clause.\n\nMurdochs pay to make problems go away\n\nIn 2010, when the Valassis case was settled for $500 million, then News Corp. President Chase Carey said the company had been convinced \"significant risks were developing in presenting this case to a jury.\" The agreement included no admission of wrongdoing and a decade-long shared distribution pact. News Corp. points to these elements, common in their settlements, to suggest these were business decisions rather than warnings of bad behavior.\n\nLongtime Murdoch watchers and some former colleagues say they discern a pattern at News America that recurred at his other properties: Roguish executives beloved by Rupert Murdoch who are able to deliver desired results get away with otherwise unacceptable behavior until it becomes impossible to tolerate further. The Murdochs pay to make problems go away. And then, at a certain point, they promise to change the culture. Ailes is bought out. O'Reilly is ousted. A new day is heralded.\n\n\"There's a problem somewhere,\" said Charles Elson, director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware.\n\n\"Commercial disputes happen all the time. But 900 million is a big number,\" Elson told NPR. \"At some point, you have to ask yourself, 'Is there something going on in the culture of a place? ' \"\n\nDespite the promise of change, many women inside Fox News tell NPR they question whether the culture has changed at all. At Fox News, three outstanding lawsuits challenge the Murdochs' contention of change, from Roginsky, suspended Fox host Andrea Tantaros and a group of African-American employees.\n\nA growing number of women are still coming forward with accusations against both Ailes and O'Reilly. Others accuse Fox News executives of ignoring their allegations. Federal prosecutors in New York City are investigating past secret payments to women who lodged complaints privately. People within Fox believe that inquiry may be broadening.\n\nThe Murdochs pointed to the process they set up since Ailes' departure, including the involvement of outside lawyers to evaluate complaints from women who allege harassment. Those lawyers work for Paul, Weiss \u2014 the longtime Murdoch law firm that handled many of the defense proceedings for News America.\n\nIn London, the executive atop the Murdochs' British newspaper wing is Rebekah Brooks, the former tabloid editor who had to resign from that same CEO position during the scandal in the summer of 2011. James Murdoch, who resigned as chairman of News Corp.'s U.K. division and of Sky during the scandal, is back as chairman of Sky.\n\nAccording to two former News Corp. executives, Carlucci offered several times to resign during the height of the News America Marketing lawsuits. Murdoch said no. Carlucci finally departed in June 2014.\n\nOne footnote: Valassis, awarded a half-billion dollars in its settlement, has more recently returned to court. The new suit alleges that News Corp. violated their agreement by continuing to engage in aggressive, anti-competitive practices. News America is denying those claims, too.\n\nFor several years after the hacking and corruption scandal erupted in the U.K., the Murdochs feared the blowback might harm their ability to hold on to their American television licenses.

Fox already ousted its CEO, Roger Ailes, over claims of sexual harassment, and The New York Times reported the network has already paid out $13 million to settle five claims against O'Reilly since 2002.\n\nFox isn't alone; allegations of pervasive sexual harassment also recently surfaced at Uber and at Sterling Jewelers, which owns the Kay, Jared and Zales chains. Uber hired former Attorney General Eric Holder to investigate claims that its culture permitted sexual harassment. Sterling's parent company says the allegations against it are without merit.\n\nExperts say rooting out a culture of sexual harassment is a big challenge but can be done if handled correctly.\n\nJeff Owens, a longtime human resources manager, has dealt with a number of sexual harassment claims over his career and says much depends on how each incident is handled. For example, a health care firm he worked for in Fort Smith, Ark., two decades ago chose to settle a sexual harassment claim against one of its executives.\n\n\"The thought was, 'This is been resolved, and we're covering up and we're moving on,' \" Owens says.\n\nBut that settlement enabled the executive's bad behavior to continue, says Owens, who now works for Tulsa Community College. Although the settlement wasn't public, it telegraphed a strong message back to the company and its culture.\n\n\"That provided a level of arrogance to that person, because they felt like the organization was protecting them because they held a strong position or had greater value,\" Owens says.\n\nAfter a second complaint was filed against the same executive six months later, he was fired. Owens says that had a very different effect on the victim and, in short order, the company's culture.\n\nIt validated both the victim's decision to come forward, and her experience, he says. \"She, in turn, feels empowered that that organization is going to protect her.\"\n\nOwens says culture flows from the top brass, and without the support of the CEO, there is no hope for change.\n\n\"As the CEO goes, so goes the culture,\" he says.\n\nMaking Choate a \"better place\"\n\nHuman resources experts say changing a bad culture also requires education and training of the entire workforce on policies and procedures, and consistent enforcement that sometimes requires firing a powerful or popular employee.\n\nIn short, it can be a deeply painful and embarrassing experience, as Choate Rosemary Hall is finding out. Last week, the elite boarding school in Wallingford, Conn., released a devastating report detailing nearly five decades of sexual abuse at the hands of a dozen teachers.\n\nCheyenne Montgomery, one of the school's victims in the 1990s, says she pushed for the report, after The Boston Globe last year published stories about allegations of sexual abuse at the school.\n\n\"I think this is going to make Choate a better place,\" she says, because it will reverse decades of silence on the matter. (NPR's policy is not to identify victims of sexual abuse unless they wish to waive that right.)\n\nThe report backs up Montgomery's story that two teachers befriended, mentored, then sexually preyed on her, starting when she was 16. It detailed incidents over five decades, involving dozens of students and 12 teachers. For example, it detailed a 1999 rape by a teacher witnessed by other students on an overseas trip as well as, more generally, how teachers lured students into their homes or off campus to take advantage of them.\n\nBesides that, Montgomery says, \"there were lots of rumors about teachers having relationships with different students.\"\n\nIn every instance, the offending teachers weren't reported to law enforcement; many were, in fact, given recommendations to teach elsewhere.\n\nMontgomery's French teacher was reported at the time by another faculty member, according to Choate's investigation, then allowed to teach for another year \u2014 a pattern Montgomery says the school demonstrated again and again.\n\n\"Pushing things under the rug and not talking about it and not acknowledging it and really taking care of the perpetrators and not the students\" was typically how it was dealt with, she says.\n\nMontgomery says because it was a boarding school, teachers had almost parental power over students and often entered their living space. But, she says, the administration willfully chose to ignore warning signs, while abusers, she says, used their own reputations as shields.\n\n\"It seems like they have this charismatic draw, like a lot of them were really popular teachers,\" she says.\n\nChanging the culture\n\nCriticizing the dominant culture can make a person feel, conversely, deeply unpopular, as Danna Hewick found out.\n\nHewick had her first job in human resources 15 years ago, working for a construction firm near Washington, D.C. It was a male-dominated business, where she says she regularly received comments like, \"Oh, baby, you're looking good,\" or dismissive comments such as, \"Sweetheart, just go sit over there and you don't need to speak up.\"\n\nHewick decided to write a corporate policy, introducing annual harassment training that defined sexual harassment and detailed the consequences of noncompliance. Because victims often are afraid to report a problem out of fear of retaliation, Hewick says it was also critical to include a reporting mechanism to allow confidential reporting.\n\nMost executives got on board, she says. Still, she says, \"it took letting go some key people that were the worst offenders that didn't want to abide by our new policy and thought we were just joking.\"\n\nShe says successfully changing that culture, over time, ushered in other changes, too.\n\n\"I think that was the start of, 'OK, well, if this wasn't the right way for this company to behave, what else do we need to look at?' \"\n\nHewick says the culture became more open and communicative, and that people were held accountable for their actions.", "keywords": ["culture", "highlights", "victims", "cultures", "students", "harassment", "turmoil", "decades", "workplace", "sexual", "fox", "report", "role", "owens", "claims", "teachers"], "polarity": 0.14993506493506495, "subjectivity": 0.5074530654530653},

The popular Fox News pundit announced his break from broadcasting at the end of The O'Reilly Factor on Tuesday night, pointedly noting that the family trip has long been in the works.\n\n\"Often around this time of year, I grab some vacation because it's spring and Easter time,\" O'Reilly told his audience. \"Last fall, I booked a trip that should be terrific.\"\n\nWhat went unsaid in Tuesday's announcement, however, is the rather conspicuous timing of the trip: O'Reilly is stepping away from his show about a week after advertisers began deserting it in droves, following revelations that O'Reilly, Fox News and parent company 21st Century Fox have quietly paid out a total of $13 million in five sexual harassment lawsuits against the star.\n\nMedia Advertisers Back Away From Bill O'Reilly Advertisers Back Away From Bill O'Reilly Listen \u00b7 3:52 3:52\n\nAt last count, dozens of companies have pulled their ads from the program. In other words, according to an analysis by the ad-tracking firm iSpot.tv, The O'Reilly Factor has lost more than half its advertisers since The New York Times first reported the settlements less than two weeks ago.\n\nEven as advertisers' support for the show has dwindled, NPR's David Folkenflik reports that discontentment with O'Reilly and the Murdoch family \u2014 which owns Fox News \u2014 is building among other employees, as well.\n\n\"There's sort of a contempt for O'Reilly from some of his colleagues, particularly female colleagues,\" Folkenflik told Morning Edition last week. \"And there's a cynicism about the degree of sincerity with which the Murdoch family and the top executives are operating.\"\n\nO'Reilly, for his part, rejects the allegations as unfounded attacks against him because of his wealth and fame, saying he only agreed to the settlements to protect his family. He has also pointed out that no women have filed complaints against him through the company's human resources department, as David reports.\n\nOthers argue this defense is less than compelling, given the fact that O'Reilly was by no means the only \u2014 or the most powerful \u2014 figure at the network to be hit with sexual harassment complaints. The company also reached deals to settle a raft of allegations against Roger Ailes. The Fox News chairman was given a massive payout last year to leave the network after those allegations \u2014 all of which he has denied.\n\nAnd there are still reverberations from Ailes' time there: For instance, some of the settlements have drawn the scrutiny of federal prosecutors, who are now investigating whether they \"were structured to avoid disclosing them to investors in 21st Century Fox,\" David notes.\n\nThat said, it's not clear whether advertiser backlash over O'Reilly is particularly hurting his program or network. The Associated Press reports that The O'Reilly Factor, the No. 1 cable TV news show, has in fact gained viewers since news of the sexual harassment charges broke, helping contribute to a record three-month period for the pundit \u2014 \"his biggest quarter ever in the show's 20-year history.\"\n\nAnd many advertisers haven't simply withdrawn their ad buys from his show \u2014 they've reallocated them to other times of day on the network, diminishing any potential financial fallout for the network.\n\nSo, while the timing of O'Reilly's departure has ginned up speculation it might be permanent, there is no concrete sign O'Reilly won't be keeping his promise to return on April 24.\n\n\"We all need R&R,\" O'Reilly advised his viewers Tuesday. \"Put it to good use. Plan it. Don't run into horror on the road. All of us deserve a break, so make sure you take yours.\"\n\nBut before that, he offered this vow:\n\n\"I'll have a full report when I return.\"", "keywords": ["factor", "backlash", "advertisers", "network", "bill", "harassment", "break", "amid", "family", "settlements", "oreilly", "fox", "sexual", "spring", "trip", "takes"], "polarity": 0.11921341070277237, "subjectivity": 0.4498349758988057},

Savenok/Getty Images Ilya S. Savenok/Getty Images\n\nFox News Channel is once more under siege, facing several concurrent scandals and legal challenges scattered across different courtrooms, and casting a pall over the network's executive suites.\n\nFresh and harsh scrutiny cast on star host Bill O'Reilly over allegations that he sexually harassed multiple women has given major corporations pause about associating themselves with the top-rated figure in cable news.\n\nIn just the past 48 hours, at least 20 advertisers, including prominent automobile manufacturers, announced they would cancel upcoming ads on his prime-time program or avoid placing future commercials there.\n\nThe ouster of chairman Roger Ailes last summer during a sexual harassment scandal was supposed to calm the waters. Yet two new lawsuits involving unrelated charges of sexual and racial discrimination raise serious questions about the decisions of Fox News Co-president Bill Shine and general counsel Dianne Brandi, among other executives.\n\nEach was a long-time Ailes lieutenant. Each survived his forced departure.\n\nTogether, they've kept O'Reilly front and center on the network, despite all the payments that O'Reilly, Fox and parent company 21st Century Fox have made over the past dozen years to quell such accusations.\n\nA history of payouts and settlements\n\nThe two executives helped to arrange payments made to privately settle past sexual harassment complaints against Roger Ailes. One former Fox News booker was paid $3 million back in 2011, five years before Gretchen Carlson's lawsuit against him exploded publicly. Shine and Brandi said they did not believe her story to be true at the time but later changed their minds as they learned of additional accusations against Ailes.\n\nSome of those past payments by Fox News to women are being investigated by federal prosecutors to see if they were structured to avoid disclosing them to investors in 21st Century Fox, as first disclosed by a lawyer to suspended Fox News host Andrea Tantaros, who is currently suing Ailes and the network.\n\nBrandi, the network's top lawyer, also stands accused of doing nothing after being informed in the fall of 2014 that Judith Slater, then the company's comptroller, had created a racist work environment in a lawsuit filed by three African-American employees of Fox News.\n\nFox News, O'Reilly and 21st Century Fox together have paid roughly $13 million to women accusing him of sexual harassment, according to The New York Times. (The lion's share went to a former Fox News producer who captured his advances on tape more than a decade ago.)\n\nA senior official at 21st Century Fox tells NPR it has spoken to O'Reilly and that the host has given assurances he believes in the company's commitment to offer a welcoming workplace for all staffers. Corporate executives did not respond to several requests for comment about the status of Shine and Brandi.\n\nThrough his lawyer, Susan Estrich, Ailes denies all the allegations made against him, including the newest, this week, by paid Fox News contributor Julie Roginsky. Ailes blames an orchestrated campaign against him.\n\nO'Reilly says he's victimized by people who target him because he's successful and wealthy. He says he agreed to settlements to help his children avoid public scorn.\n\nFox News typically denigrates those who file suit or criticize its stars and executives, but it is currently uncharacteristically subdued, in keeping with a promise made last summer that the culture of the network would change.\n\nRoginsky's lawsuit against Ailes argues that promise from the Murdoch family, which controls the company, has rung hollow.\n\nIn her sexual harassment lawsuit, Roginsky alleges that Shine and Brandi retaliated against her for failing to come to Ailes' defense and for raising her complaints about Ailes' conduct internally.\n\nFox News did fire Slater, the comptroller at the heart of the racial discrimination lawsuit, but as the lawyers for the plaintiffs note, only in late March, several days before the suit was filed.\n\nFox News and Brandi have not responded to the specific question of whether she was told of Slater's behavior, in 2014 and 2015, and refused to take action, as alleged in the lawsuit by Monica Douglas, the head of credit and collection in Fox News' accounting department, and one of the plaintiffs in the new racial bias suit.\n\nShine and Brandi's decisions have been challenged previously.\n\nTheir continued presence raises the more fundamental question of the judgment of Rupert Murdoch, the family patriarch, who stepped in to oversee Fox News after Ailes was hustled out.\n\nO'Reilly's continued presence has undercut the Murdochs' contention of a shift in culture, according to several women who work at the network who spoke to NPR on condition of anonymity.\n\nAn audition is followed by an awkward dinner\n\nNot everyone who has made allegations against O'Reilly or Ailes received or even sought money. Wendy Walsh, a California-based psychologist and former television news reporter and anchor, auditioned on the air for a paid slot with a recurring role \u2014 \"a very big opportunity,\" in her words.\n\nWalsh told NPR that just three weeks in, she received a call from an O'Reilly producer saying he wanted to arrange a dinner during an upcoming trip in Los Angeles. Shortly after the outset of the meal at the restaurant Wolfgang Puck at Hotel Bel-Air, O'Reilly promised Walsh the job, she says.\n\nAfter a cordial dinner, O'Reilly said, \"Let's get out of here,\" and according to Walsh's account to NPR, \"a kind of awkward thing happened\": he headed past the hostess stand to the right, toward the elevators to his hotel room. Walsh says she headed left, toward the bar. (A woman answering the phone at Wolfgang Puck at Hotel Bel-Air confirmed the layout.)\n\nWalsh says she declined O'Reilly's entreaties to come up to his room \u2014 and that he turned nasty at the bar, telling her there would be no job. \"It was a sad cocktail party story that women tell each other and shrug our shoulders and go, 'Ugh, another one,' \" Walsh says. \"I can't believe this is still going on.\"\n\nO'Reilly has not directly responded to the substance of Walsh's depiction of this episode but issued a more general statement saying no women had filed complaints through the network's human resources department.\n\nO'Reilly's show is the network's top revenue-generating program; and the network has proved highly lucrative for 21st Century Fox. But any financial hit from balky advertisers is likely to be limited as Fox News relies more on licensing fees from cable providers than from advertising spots. And most advertisers are placing their commercials on different Fox News programs, not withdrawing altogether.\n\nOne which is: SHRM, a leading trade group for the human resources industry.", "keywords": ["scandals", "21st", "past", "walsh", "crest", "lawsuit", "siege", "women", "century", "ailes", "fox", "oreilly", "sexual"], "polarity": 0.06609694691273639, "subjectivity": 0.3923214855320119},

Patriarch Rupert Murdoch has led Fox News since Ailes was felled by fallout from the lawsuit by former host Gretchen Carlson that triggered the scandal.\n\nRoginsky's suit adds to the list of sexual harassment allegations against Ailes, which also includes those made by former Fox News journalists Megyn Kelly and Laurie Dhue. Through his lawyers, Ailes has denied all the previous allegations to date.\n\nPerhaps more troublingly for Fox News and its corporate parent, 21st Century Fox, Roginsky also accuses the network's current president, Bill Shine; its longtime top lawyer, Dianne Brandi; and other senior executives of complicity in Ailes' harassment and of punishing her for raising the issue.\n\nIn a statement emailed to NPR, Ailes' lawyer Susan Estrich called Roginsky's descriptions of meetings with her client \"total hogwash.\"\n\n\"The idea that Mr. Ailes would pressure Ms. Roginsky or any other women to have sexual relations with him is total nonsense,\" the statement reads. \"This is about someone who wants to pile-on in a massive character assassination in order to achieve what she did not accomplish on the merits.\"\n\nNPR is seeking comment from Fox News, 21st Century Fox, Shine and Brandi in response to the allegations in Roginsky's suit.\n\nAnother in a long list of complaints about Fox\n\nRoginsky's allegations arrive as new attention is being given to similar accusations against Fox News' brightest star, Bill O'Reilly. The right-of-center opinion host and Fox News have made payments totaling roughly $13 million over a dozen years to settle complaints that he harassed female former co-workers, according to The New York Times.\n\nSuspended Fox News host Andrea Tantaros has also filed suit, citing what she says was sexual harassment by Ailes and O'Reilly. She alleges that Shine also failed to take her complaints seriously. All three men deny her claims.\n\nThough some of O'Reilly's offending remarks were captured on tape, he has repeatedly insisted he is a target for wrongful accusations because of his wealth and success. O'Reilly has said he only settles complaints to ensure his children do not have to endure public scorn.\n\nThe enduring presence of O'Reilly on Fox's prized 8 p.m. ET slot, despite that history, has led some critics to dismiss the commitment of Shine and Brandi to combating sexual harassment and even to question why they retain their posts.\n\nRoginsky's suit is likely to fuel those critics further.\n\n\"Shine retaliated against plaintiff because of her complaints of harassment and retaliation [against Ailes],\" the lawsuit reads, \"and because of plaintiff's refusal to malign Gretchen Carlson and join 'Team Roger' when Carlson sued Ailes ... Shine also aided and abetted Ailes' acts of retaliation and harassment.\"\n\nFox News promised to change the culture\n\nRoginsky said in the complaint that Shine and Brandi took no action to investigate her allegations that Ailes had harassed her once they learned of his behavior toward her. The company had put new policies in place and hired an outside law firm to lead an inquiry into the mounting accusations against Ailes, but did not pursue her accusations, according to the lawsuit.\n\nSuch concerns first arose at Fox well before last summer. In 2011, Shine and Brandi played a role in arranging a $3 million settlement with a former Fox News senior booker and events planner, Laurie Luhn, who alleged Ailes had blackmailed and harassed her into performing sexual acts for more than 20 years. They said they did not believe Luhn's claims at that time.\n\nIn this case, Roginsky alleges, Ailes' former top deputies sought to forestall criticism and any legal exposure for the network.\n\nRoginsky is a 43-year-old single mother who has advised and worked for such leading New Jersey Democrats as Sen. Cory Booker, the late Sen. Frank Lautenberg and the former senator and Gov. Jon Corzine. She joined Fox News formally in fall 2011 after seven years of appearing regularly as an unpaid commentator, the lawsuit states.\n\nIn her suit, Roginsky alleges that Ailes repeatedly invoked the prospect of elevating her from a contributor's job to be a permanent host on The Five. She contends she merited the promotion given her performance and the ratings when she appeared on the show.\n\nSuch a perch at Fox would have given Roginsky greater visibility, likely increasing her pay from Fox News significantly into the upper six figures and also propelling an increase in possible outside revenues such as book contracts or speaking fees.\n\nAiles routinely steered such conversations about Roginsky's career to her personal life, her looks and his desire to see her socially, she alleges.\n\nThe issue came to a head in a meeting in late April 2015, according to the lawsuit, after Ailes said loyalty had to be a two-way street. Ailes led Roginsky to believe she would get the one slot for a liberal commentator previously held by The Five host Bob Beckel. Ailes confided to Roginsky that Beckel would not return to Fox because of substance abuse problems, the suit states. (Two months later Fox cited substance abuse in firing Beckel, who has spoken openly about his past addiction to alcohol and drugs.)\n\n\"Ailes cynically toyed with Roginsky, saying that he would really like to give her a permanent spot on 'The Five,'\" the lawsuit states. \"Immediately after this statement, Ailes remarked that 'if it wouldn't get us both into so much trouble' he would take Roginsky 'out for a drink.' \"\n\nAccording to the suit, Ailes continued: \"Since being seen in public together would get us into trouble, maybe we could just do it privately in my office instead, so no one would know.\"\n\nRoginsky alleges that when she conveyed she did not think that was a good idea, Ailes shut down any further talk of a promotion. The suit says Ailes refused ever to meet with Roginsky again and pulled her from guest appearances on The Five.\n\nFox News claimed to have changed its climate\n\nBeyond the allegations against Ailes, Roginsky's suit contradicts the representation by Fox News and parent company 21st Century Fox that the network has changed its climate for its female employees since the departure of Ailes under duress last July.\n\nCarlson ultimately received a $20 million settlement and a rare public apology issued by Lachlan and James Murdoch, who together with their father lead 21st Century Fox. (Roginsky hired the same legal team used by Carlson, led by New Jersey workplace law attorney Nancy Erika Smith.)\n\nUnlike Carlson, Roginsky has no clause in her contract requiring she settle disputes in binding and confidential arbitration.\n\nExecutives pressured Roginsky to join other prominent Fox News personalities on what they called \"Team Roger\" to denigrate and discredit Carlson publicly. Greta Van Susteren, Geraldo Rivera, Kimberly Guilfoyle, Elisabeth Hasselbeck and Jeanine Pirro were among those who cast doubt on Carlson's story. (Van Susteren later left the network and apologized to Carlson; Rivera also apologized.)\n\nAt the Republican National Convention last July, according to the lawsuit, as Ailes' professional fate hung in the balance, Fox News contributor Angela McGlowan told Roginsky that \"it's all hands on deck\" in defending Ailes. Roginsky alleges she told McGlowan, a former lobbyist for the Murdochs' media empire who served as a conduit to Fox News executives, that she believed Carlson's allegations and could not participate in a campaign against her because Ailes had harassed her, too.\n\nWhen Roginsky and Shine met in late July, the longtime programming chief for Ailes was agitated, telling her that \"everything they are saying about Roger is true,\" as Roginsky's lawyer recounts the meeting in court papers.\n\nShe was passed over for a hosting job on the midday show Outnumbered. In late November, Roginsky told Shine and his deputy, Suzanne Scott, that she awaited the fulfillment of Ailes' earlier promise to host a show.\n\nNo such job emerged. Instead, according to the suit, Shine praised a recent documentary, comparing the chemistry of the team that built Fox News to that of the rock group the Eagles.", "keywords": ["host", "suit", "lawsuit", "harassment", "response", "fox", "ailes", "shine", "sexual", "slams", "roginsky", "fresh", "carlson", "claims"], "polarity": 0.055782919228297395, "subjectivity": 0.37024567402718683},

The unanimous ruling by a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit delighted its supporters and disappointed its opponents.\n\nThe appellate panel remanded the case back to the district court for a hearing on the merits.\n\nSB4 was approved by the Texas legislature and signed by Republican Gov. Gregg Abbott in May 2017. Among other things, it allows police to ask about an individual's immigration status during routine interactions such as a traffic stop. It also requires police and sheriffs to comply with federal immigration detainer requests to hold criminal suspects for possible deportation.

Dangerous criminals shouldn't be allowed back into our communities to possibly commit more crimes.\"\n\nOpponents of the law said they are disappointed, but not surprised by the appellate ruling.\n\n\"The decision is a blow to the civil rights of every Texan,\" said Efren Olivares, an attorney for the Texas Civil Rights Project. \"Millions of immigrants and people of color face the prospect of unlawful racial profiling and discrimination. But we are not deterred. We knew this was going to be a long fight when we started and we are prepared to go the distance.\"\n\nHe said his group may seek an en banc hearing by the 5th Circuit. Meanwhile, they will be monitoring enforcement of the law to see whether any civil or constitutional rights are violated.

This game is about to get a good deal faster.\n\nAt least, that's what Minor League Baseball officials are hoping. The league announced Wednesday that it plans to institute some pretty big rule changes for the 2018 season \u2014 including beginning extra innings with a runner automatically on second base and, in certain situations, shaving five seconds off the pitch timer the league had already instituted in triple- and double-A ball.\n\nNow, when there are no runners on base, pitchers at those levels will get just 15 seconds to begin their pitching motion. When runners are on, pitchers will still enjoy the full 20-second clock first instituted in the minors in 2015.\n\nIf the pitcher fails to meet his deadline, a ball will be awarded to the batter's count, while a strike will be counted against the batter if he's not ready for the pitch. For a 15-day grace period at the start of the 2018 season, though, violators will just receive warnings as they get used to the new system.\n\nAs for the big rule change in extra innings: Beginning in the 10th, when the leadoff hitter takes his place in the batter's box, the teammate directly ahead of him in the batting order will set up across from him on second base \u2014 already halfway to home plate before a pitch has even been thrown.\n\n\"We believe these changes to extra innings will enhance the fans' enjoyment of the game and will become something that the fans will look forward to on nights where the game is tied late in the contest,\" Minor League Baseball President Pat O'Conner said in a statement.\n\nHe added that officials also have the players' interests in mind, saying that lengthy extra innings and longer games can pose health risks, both in the near- and long-term. He noted that their partners in Major League Baseball also have a vested interest in keeping their farm team prospects injury-free.\n\nVisits to the pitcher's mound from coaches and other players will also be capped.\n\n\"We feel that limiting mound visits and decreasing the amount of time between pitches with no runners on base will further improve the pace of play,\" said O'Conner, \"and make it a more enjoyable experience for our fans.\"\n\nMajor League Baseball, for its part, will only be instituting a cap on mound visits, deferring a decision on pitch clocks this year \"in order to provide players with an opportunity to speed up the game without the use of those timers,\" MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said last month.\n\nThe rule changes were greeted Wednesday by many long-time fans with, let's say, a fair bit of skepticism. Die-hard baseball fans rarely respond kindly to the notion of fiddling with their pastime, and a cursory Twitter search \u2014 \"really horrendous idea,\" the \"dumbest idea since the glowing puck,\" \"GROSS!\" \u2014 reveals a little immediate resistance.\n\nThat reference to pucks is telling, though: If the MLB decides to follow the lead of the minor leagues, it won't be the only major sports league in the U.S. to brave the third rail in recent years with rule changes to speed up play or prevent injuries.\n\nThe NHL, for instance, got rid of the two-line pass rule in 2005, opening up the game to rink-spreading plays, and has toyed more than once recently with its own overtime regulations to coax more excitement out of the extra period. And the NFL has been chipping away at high-impact kickoff plays, also with an eye toward reducing player injuries.", "keywords": ["changes", "baseball", "innings", "game", "dust", "pitch", "clocks", "fans", "extra", "league", "rule", "kicks", "minor"], "polarity": 0.02459415584415586, "subjectivity": 0.4525162337662337},

In many cities, the walkouts were anti-gun protests, but at a high school in Helena, Mont., students said the walkout was a memorial. Montana Public Radio's Corin Cates-Carney reports.\n\nCORIN CATES-CARNEY, BYLINE: Montana's culture of firearms runs deep in sport and self-defense. When students of Capital High walked out into their school courtyard, the mood was more grief than anger.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nAMANDA PENLEY: Seventeen people were shot in a school - a small-town high school not much different than ours.\n\nCATES-CARNEY: That's Amanda Penley, a junior at Capital. She gave a speech as a member of the Helena Youth Against Gun Violence, which formed after the Parkland shooting. She said the walkout was a memorial with no political agenda.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nPENLEY: I would like to ask you all to remain respectful throughout this memorial. It is important to keep in mind that many of us gathered here are grieving the loss of not only the Parkland students but also friends or family members lost to gun violence.\n\nCATES-CARNEY: After her speech, students read names and short bios of the Parkland victims. They ended with a moment of silence. Nathan Hartnett is a senior at Capital High who also walked out and attended the memorial. He says he's a strong supporter of the Second Amendment.\n\nNATHAN HARTNETT: But I still think that it's a broken system, and we've seen so many tragedies.\n\nCATES-CARNEY: Hartnett, along with the Helena Youth Against Gun Violence, supports advocating for what they call smart gun legislation, like making sure there are background checks on gun purchases. Some members of the group want to increase the minimum age to purchase a gun. But Tanlee Pipinich, also a senior Capital, says the group's main focus is education, including teaching students what to do if a shooter enters the school.\n\nTANLEE PIPINICH: We do own a lot of guns, and there are a lot of gun advocates in Montana. It's more of awareness towards how to use those. Like, especially in hunters' education, like, you're taught how to handle a gun safely. So I think that's just something we're trying to push for.\n\nCATES-CARNEY: Students across Helena plan to take part in the March for Our Lives event this month.

The country's Nordic neighbor, Finland, has unseated the Norwegians with a smile.\n\nAs of this writing, the Finns are the happiest people in the world.\n\nAt least, that's according to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Solutions Network \u2014 which on Wednesday released its annual rankings of 156 countries, using a statistical model based on a gamut of considerations ranging from their citizens' healthy life expectancy and income to their governments' levels of social support and government corruption.

The Olympic powerhouse fell no further than second.\n\nIn fact, this list's leaders may have shuffled a bit \u2014 but, as the report explains, \"the top ten positions are held by the same countries as in the last two years.\" And that means a very Nordic leaderboard: Of those 10, only Switzerland (5), Canada (7), New Zealand (8) and Australia (10) hail from somewhere other than Europe's northern reaches.\n\nReaders will need to skim a little lower to find the U.S., which dropped four spots from last year's list to No. 18, just above the U.K. and the United Arab Emirates.

Except two people.\"\n\nAuthorities have charged Salman with aiding and abetting her husband, who pledged allegiance to the Islamic State militant group the night of the shooting, and with obstructing the efforts of federal local and federal investigators. If convicted and given the maximum sentence, Salman would spend the rest of her life in prison.\n\nProsecutors say she was well aware of Mateen's intentions ahead of time, joining a spending spree before his rampage and casing potential targets, including Disney Springs. \"What would make people more upset,\" Mandolfo said Mateen once asked her, \"an attack at a club or at Disney?\"\n\n\"The defendant's cold actions gave Omar Mateen a green light to commit these crimes on behalf of ISIS,\" Mandolfo added, according to the Orlando Sentinel.\n\nDefense attorney Linda Moreno, for her part, described Salman as a \"simple woman,\" easily influenced and often abused by her cheating husband. Moreno asserted that Salman believed she and her husband were planning a better future for their young child, not an attack.\n\n\"It's natural to assign blame,\" Moreno said in her opening statement, according to WMFE's Brendan Byrne, \"but the law does not punish failure to act.\"\n\nAs for the conflicting statements Salman made to authorities \u2014 which prosecutors say confirm her foreknowledge of Mateen's attack and intent to mislead investigators after it \u2014 Moreno asserted those responses were given under duress. The FBI did not record its interrogation of Salman, the lawyer noted, arguing that they coerced Salman into saying what agents wanted to hear \u2014 and saying things that were in many cases \"provably false,\" Moreno said.\n\n\"Omar Mateen is a monster,\" she said in court, as CNN reports. \"Noor Salman is a mother, not a monster. Her only sin is she married a monster.\"\n\nThe trial is unfolding in a federal courtroom just two miles from Pulse, the gay club where Salman's husband conducted the massacre.\n\nAnd wounds remain fresh in the area. The court needed more than a week \u2014 and scores of rejected juror possibilities \u2014 to finally settle on the jury for the trial.\n\n\"You really want to address the tremendous tragedy and injustice that was visited upon Orlando's people by this crime,\" national security expert Karen Greenberg told WMFE's Amy Green earlier this month as jury selection got underway, adding that jurors must be able to distinguish between Salman's actions and those of her husband.\n\n\"To have somebody in custody who is a proxy defendant is something you definitely want to avoid.\"\n\nOther onlookers, such as the only demonstrator who set up outside the court Wednesday, appear to have already made up their minds: \"Fry her till she has no 'Pulse,' \" read one of his two signs.\n\nMeanwhile, strong emotions were evident inside the courtroom, as well \u2014 though in at least one case, that emotion appeared to be less anger than pain.\n\nThe prosecution's first witness Wednesday, Orlando Police Officer Adam Gruler, \"became choked up several times during testimony, reports a producer with ABC's local affiliate. Gruler had been off duty and working security outside the club when gunshots rang out around 2 a.m., and he knew from the sound of Mateen's assault-style rifle that he was outgunned.\n\nHe said he waited until other officers arrived soon after the gunfire started, then they entered the building together. At that point, he said, \"time froze.\"\n\n\"There was no concept of any time for me,\" Gruler told the court, according to the Sentinel. And the carnage was immediately clear. \"No matter where we stepped, there was blood.\"\n\nGruler is just the first of many witnesses still to testify in the coming weeks.

Conor's been to every fish fry, every VFW, every American Legion, senior center, doors,\" Fitzgerald told NPR's Scott Detrow. \"He's been relating to people.

The race has not been officially called, but a review of the votes indicates that Lamb has an insurmountable lead over Republican state Rep. Rick Saccone.\n\nLamb's victory would be a huge win for Democrats, and a major blow to President Trump.\n\nTrump won this district by 20 points in 2016, and Republican Tim Murphy \u2014 who resigned in October after a report that he had encouraged a woman with whom he had an affair to get an abortion \u2014 won his last eight elections easily.\n\nBut Lamb seems to have overcome that Republican advantage in this largely white, working-class district by touting his bio \u2014 a Marine Corps veteran, former prosecutor, Catholic; and his more conservative positions \u2014 on guns, abortion, crime.\n\nHis first TV ad highlights the fact that he grew up in the district. In the same town, in fact, where he now lives \u2014 Mount Lebanon, a suburb south of Pittsburgh.\n\nConor Lamb via YouTube\n\nHe graduated from Pittsburgh Central Catholic High School in 2002, earned both his undergraduate and law degrees at the University of Pennsylvania, and worked as a prosecutor in the Marine Corps \u2014 first in Okinawa, Japan, and then for the Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals.\n\nAfter leaving active duty in 2013 and joining the Reserves, Lamb was appointed an assistant U.S. attorney in Pittsburgh. There, his bio says, he \"led prosecutions against drug dealers and violent criminals and helped establish the Justice Department's Pittsburgh office as a national leader in the fight against the heroin epidemic, working to build partnerships between law enforcement and community members in places that have been hit hardest by the crisis.\"\n\nLamb stepped down from the U.S. Attorney's Office last fall, shortly after Murphy resigned his seat.\n\nThough this is his first run for office, Lamb comes from a family that has been active in state and local politics. His uncle is Pittsburgh Controller Michael Lamb; and his grandfather Thomas Lamb was a state representative, the Democratic majority leader in the state Senate in the 1970s and secretary of legislative affairs for Gov. Robert Casey.\n\nUnlike his Republican opponent \u2014 who billed himself as \"Trump before Trump was Trump\" \u2014 Lamb stayed away from making the race about the president or partisan politics.\n\n\"The biggest issues facing the 18th Congressional District aren't partisan,\" his campaign website reads. \"Heroin kills both Democrats and Republicans. Health care is too expensive. The roads and bridges we all use are crumbling. But the people we send to Washington aren't solving these problems. I'm running for Congress because it's time for that to change.\"\n\nOn the campaign trail, Lamb highlighted his work fighting the opioid crisis \u2014 which has hit the region hard \u2014 as well as his support for unions. In a district with 86,000 union households, union endorsement was key to his success.\n\nAt a rally Sunday night, United Mine Workers of America President Cecil Roberts came out hard for Lamb, calling him \"a God-fearing, union-supporting, gun-owning, job-protecting, pension-defending, Social Security-believing, health care-creating and sending-drug-dealers-to-jail Democrat.\"\n\nIf certified as the winner, Lamb will serve out the rest of the year in the House, representing PA-18. But the district as it is now will cease to exist at the end of the year because of court-ordered redistricting in Pennsylvania. So if Lamb wants to stay in the House after 2018, he will have to run again \u2014 in a district that is likely to look different from the one he just won.\n\nSamantha Fields is the producer of the NPR Politics Podcast.", "keywords": ["trump", "republican", "president", "election", "winner", "apparent", "lamb", "district", "pennsylvania", "run", "state", "special", "conor", "prosecutor", "pittsburgh"], "polarity": 0.046434481594056096, "subjectivity": 0.358340087808173},

No one was hurt in the bombing, which exploded in the imam's office.\n\nInterviewed by federal agents on Saturday, McWhorter said the three were also behind the attempted bombing of a women's health clinic in Champaign, Ill., in November.\n\nIt was Hari's idea to bomb the mosque, McWhorter told agents.\n\nAccording to the affidavit, McWhorter said they \"did not intend to kill anyone but wanted to 'scare them out of the country' (referring to Muslims) because they push their beliefs on everyone else.\" He told investigators the bombing was primarily intended to show Muslims: \"Hey, you're not welcome here, get the [expletive] out.\"\n\nMorris allegedly smashed in the mosque's window with a sledgehammer and threw in the explosive device, which McWhorter described as a \"huge [expletive] black powder bomb.\"\n\nMcWhorter told agents that they and his stepson, 18-year-old Ellis Mack, also conducted three Walmart robberies in Illinois and carried out a home invasion in Indiana.\n\nThe four are charged with possession of a machine gun, and the affidavit for those charges reads like the script for a Coen brothers movie.\n\nAmong its details is an emailed tip the FBI received on Feb. 19 reporting a \"possible terrorism threat,\" alerting authorities to bomb-making materials inside a suitcase and gray bag in a Clarence, Ill., shed.\n\nThe threat said, in part: \"i am afraid someone will get hurt if someone doesnt do something i also sent something about it to the newspaper so if you just blow it off like you did that school shooter kid in florida the press will know you got a tip so you better check it out just saying you did screw up once... .\"\n\nAuthorities followed the tip and found the bomb-making materials just where it had promised. But in his interview with federal agents, McWhorter admitted that he, Hari, and Morris had planted the materials on someone else's property to get them in trouble and that Hari was the one who had sent the tip to the FBI.\n\nIt turns out that Hari has long made headlines in the farm towns near Champaign \u2014 and sometimes beyond.\n\nJust last year, The Chicago Tribune interviewed Hari about his bid to win a federal contract to build President Trump's border wall.\n\nYou can see Hari's full vision, which he calls the Great Western International Border Wall, in this video.\n\nCrisis Resolution Security Services INC YouTube\n\n\"The wall will be culturally significant,\" the narrator says, \"a powerful architectural statement of the determination of the American people to defend their nation and its Anglo-Saxon heritage, Western culture and English language.\" (Hari's wall is clearly modeled on the Great Wall of China.)\n\n\"The wall exists to protect the economic rights of the U.S. population and to protect our way of life from people who have different value systems,\" the narration goes on, before concluding: \"Build that wall. Make America great again.\" That last sentence was the Trump campaign's slogan.\n\nThe government's request for proposals asked that the wall be 30 feet high. Hari's is 56 feet high and features a 22-foot-wide road running along the top for walkers and bikers, as well as tourist centers at the wall's endpoints in Texas and California.\n\n\"We're probably the only ones who have submitted a proposal making it recreational,\" he told the Tribune.\n\nThe proposal came from Hari's business, Crisis Resolution Security Services, which sold emergency evacuation services at $3,995 for 10 years: \"Consider, for the cost of a cheap handgun, you can cover your family each year.\" He said the company would evacuate clients from disaster situations.\n\nThe company's website lists the threats customers should consider, from earthquakes to riots.\n\nHari admitted to the Tribune that he wasn't really an expert in constructing security barriers. \"I have had some experience with it, but not a great deal,\" he said.\n\nHe did have experience, however, with being on the lam: \"I was an illegal alien for almost a year in Belize,\" he told the newspaper.\n\nHari was convicted of child abduction in 2006 after taking his 13- and 15-year-old daughters to Mexico and Belize, apparently in fear that he would lose custody of them to his ex-wife. He was tracked down, returned to the U.S. and sentenced to 30 months' probation, according to the Champaign News-Gazette.\n\nAnd Hari was in the news again just last month, when he filed a lawsuit against the government, for competing with his food-safety certification business, the Bloomington, Ill., Pantagraph reports.\n\nHari is now in federal detention, with his preliminary hearing set for March 21.", "keywords": ["bid", "tip", "man", "wall", "federal", "mosque", "contract", "border", "haris", "minnesota", "hari", "bombing", "mcwhorter", "great", "told", "charged"], "polarity": 0.09483585858585859, "subjectivity": 0.4604671717171716},

The lawsuit also names Fox reporters Malia Zimmerman and a periodic Fox commentator.\n\nThe May 2017 story echoed and propelled conspiracy theories about Rich's death and the DNC leaks, strongly suggesting his killing might have been related. U.S. intelligence officials under Presidents Obama and Trump say that people acting at the direction of the Russian government hacked into the DNC's servers.\n\nFox News retracted the story a week later after widespread outrage, but the network never apologized for the story or explained what went wrong.\n\nIn their federal suit, filed Tuesday in the Southern District of New York, the Riches allege that they have been \"collateral damage in a political war\" and say their son's death was exploited for political benefit. A spokeswoman for Fox News said late Tuesday that the network and Zimmerman will not comment, citing the pending litigation.\n\nThe Riches also sued Ed Butowsky, a Dallas investment manager who periodically offered commentary on financial matters for Fox Business Network and Fox News. Butowsky also figured as a defendant in an earlier lawsuit filed last August against Fox News and Zimmerman by their chief named source, a Fox News commentator named Rod Wheeler.\n\nThe Riches' lawsuit alleges \"extreme and outrageous conduct\" by Fox, Zimmerman and Butowsky in developing a false story \"painting Joel and Mary's son as a criminal and a traitor to the United States.\" They also allege the network, the reporter and the investor made it appear that Joel and Mary Rich were involved in the deception.\n\nButowsky had arranged for Wheeler, a former Washington, D.C., homicide detective, to be hired by the Riches as a private investigator to look into their son's unsolved killing. He paid Wheeler's bills. And he had connected Zimmerman with Wheeler as well, according to materials that were part of Wheeler's lawsuit.\n\nThe backdrop involved Butowsky's efforts to draw upon reporting by Seymour Hersh and his White House meeting with former Trump administration spokesman Sean Spicer, as NPR later detailed.\n\nThe original Fox News story cited a federal investigator who had seen an FBI forensic report said to detail contacts Seth Rich made with WikiLeaks. After its retraction, Fox News said the story had not been subjected to sufficient editorial scrutiny and that the network would investigate further. Fox has never again mentioned or explained the reference to the FBI report or the unnamed federal investigator.\n\nIn a message to Fox News hosts contained in the Wheeler lawsuit, Butowsky wrote that he was \"actually the one who's been putting this together\" in urging them to conclude on-air \"the Russians did not hack our computer systems and [steal] emails and there was no collusion like trump with the Russians.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Butowsky told NPR he was puzzled by having to respond to the Riches' lawsuit. \"This lawsuit claims that an article I did not write, and did not participate in writing, caused emotional distress,\" he said.\n\nButowsky also told NPR that he feels for the Riches. \"Not only do I empathize with a grieving family, I spent money to try to help them,\" Butowsky says, referring to his hiring of Wheeler.\n\nThe Riches' lawsuit states that Butowsky sought out the Riches and recruited Wheeler, who, it alleges, worked for the benefit of Fox News and Zimmerman.\n\nSpicer told NPR last summer that Butowsky was a reliable surrogate on economic issues for the Republican Party and for Trump. Wheeler's lawsuit cites specific messages sent by Butowsky invoking White House and even the president's support for the story, alleging that Butowsky wrote to Wheeler that they should do \"whatever we've got to do\" to help push Zimmerman across the finish line. In another, Butowsky wrote, \"Not to add any more pressure but the president just read the article. He wants the article out immediately. It's now all up to you.\"\n\nButowsky previously told NPR he was joking in sending those messages, and that Trump had never seen Zimmerman's story prior to its posting.", "keywords": ["zimmerman", "butowsky", "trump", "riches", "sue", "network", "parents", "seth", "richs", "lawsuit", "npr", "fox", "wheeler", "baseless", "told"], "polarity": 0.026233262861169837, "subjectivity": 0.3752995066948554},

In a few minutes, we'll hear about the impact of student protests throughout history. First, Rowan Moore Gerety reports from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School where that shooting happened.\n\nROWAN MOORE GERETY, BYLINE: Tenth grader Liam Kiernan began his day the same way he has each morning since he's been back at school - stopping at the roadside memorial to say a few words to his friend Gina Montalto, who was killed in the shooting.\n\nLIAM KIERNAN: As long as I still remember her, she's not completely gone. You know, I don't want people to know her as somebody that was shot. I want people to know her as the beautiful and amazing person that she was.\n\nMAX ROJAS: You guys rock.\n\nGERETY: Today, Kiernan and almost every other student got a high five and words of encouragement from Pastor Max Rojas on their way into school.\n\nROJAS: Today's going to be exciting, man.\n\nLIAM: Yeah. We're getting the whole world with us.\n\nROJAS: Yeah.\n\nLIAM: And I can't wait for...\n\nROJAS: You're going to change the world.\n\nLIAM: That's what I really hope to.\n\nROJAS: You going to. You're going to.\n\nGERETY: Then at 10 a.m., Douglas High's 3,000 students streamed out onto the football field.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN: Good morning, Eagles. Good morning.\n\nGERETY: That's where the school hoped to keep the walkout contained - a 17-minute remembrance for the 17 victims. Suddenly hundreds of whooping middle schoolers came into view...\n\nUNIDENTIFIED CHILDREN: (Whooping).\n\nGERETY: ...Taking over the street as they headed for Douglas High.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED CHILD: What are they going to do, stop 1,500 kids?\n\nGERETY: Eighth grader Alexis Deveaux says Westglades Middle School was in the middle of its own on-campus walkout when two students decided to take to the streets.\n\nALEXIS DEVEAUX: And everyone started following them. And I think we all got suspended. But it's worth it 'cause I feel like they went to school thinking they were safe. And that horrific day was terrible.\n\nGERETY: The younger students' chants gave their older peers a jolt. Soon a crowd from both schools took off for a rally in a nearby park.\n\nNICHOLAS HERNANDEZ: I think we just decided that standing outside for 17 minutes in our school wasn't enough.\n\nGERETY: Ninth grader Nicholas Hernandez was near the back of a line of students that stretched out for a mile.\n\nNICHOLAS: No one needs an AR-15 unless you are in the military. That is not a weapon for hunting. That is a weapon of war.\n\nGERETY: One of his classmates ran alongside the crowd, carrying a sign.

She served for 32 years in the diplomatic corps, including a stint as an assistant secretary of state. She is hopeful that Rex Tillerson's exit marks the end of a challenging period for the department's rank and file.\n\nVICTORIA NULAND: Because they really felt alienated from this secretary. They felt like he was not using the best talent and that most importantly he wasn't leading out there in the world or having any influence on President Trump.\n\nMCCAMMON: It became pretty clear from things that President Trump has said that he and Secretary Tillerson didn't see eye to eye on some issues, never really hit it off. Do you expect a better relationship with Mike Pompeo?\n\nNULAND: Well, this is an absolutely essential aspect of success as a secretary of state. So I think this is a hopeful aspect in the naming of Mike Pompeo that he clearly has forged a relationship of trust with President Trump that on some of these more difficult issues I am hopeful that he'll be able to roll up his sleeves, come forward with some political diplomatic coalition answers to some of these problems and influence President Trump to consider them and work with him so that the United States has more than military answers to the problems out there in the world.\n\nMCCAMMON: I want to ask you about how you expect Pompeo to lead on some of these most volatile issues, some of these turbulent relationships. Let's start with Russia. When the Kremlin spokesman was asked about the implications of this leadership change at the State Department, he said - and this is a direct quote - \"it's hardly possible to get worse.\" Is that your assessment, too? Is it only up from here for Mike Pompeo when it comes to Russia?\n\nNULAND: I think it's really important to be very rigorous in the way we deal with the Russian federation, everything from meddling in democratic governance to violation of arms control treaties to Ukraine to dealing in Syria. And, you know, I was pleased to see that Mike Pompeo, along with every other member of the Trump administration security Cabinet, has been very tough in saying, yes, Russia meddled in the 2016 elections. Yes, they will do it again. We now need to get past the president's concern that somehow this affects his legitimacy and to a rigorous set of policies to deter and harden our systems against that kind of manipulation and make it clear to the Russians that it will cost rather than just ignoring the problem this seems to be where we've been for the last year.\n\nMCCAMMON: I want to move on to North Korea. Pompeo has taken a hard line in the past on North Korea. He's talked about the need for North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to go. How do you foresee see that stance affecting this historic meeting that's being planned for May between President Trump and Kim Jong Un?\n\nNULAND: Well, embarking on negotiations with North Korea is a very important step to test whether they really are prepared for denuclearization, and doing it at the presidential level so early in the cycle is also a high-risk gambit. So what it means is you need really careful preparation ahead of time. So Mike Pompeo, if confirmed, will jump right into the deep end of the pool, but at least he'll have the trust of the president rather than having the president just show up at the DMZ and start talking with no prep.\n\nMCCAMMON: There's a lot going on here. It seems like a tall order for someone stepping in at this juncture. Whatever Tillerson's shortcomings, is there a danger that his departure from the State Department at this moment could destabilize the department and its diplomatic efforts? And how hard will it be for Pompeo to step in now?\n\nNULAND: Look, from where I'm sitting as a 32-year veteran of the State Department, the building had become a hollow shell, and American diplomacy had shriveled to barely perceptible presence on the planet. So I want to hope that somebody who's got the president's ear, somebody who understands that his diplomats are his greatest strengths, will put U.S. diplomacy back in the center and ensure that we have more options than simply a military option in all these difficult parts of the world. And those of us who believe in diplomacy and believe in using the great power of our core around the world hope that that's how he approaches this job.\n\nMCCAMMON: That's Victoria Nuland, a former assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs and now the CEO of the Center for a New American Security. Thank you so much.\n\nNULAND: Thank you.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF AARABMUZIK'S \"WANTED\")\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 NPR. All rights reserved.

Though they've opted to keep the same typography and smokey, partners-in-crime aesthetic for promotion of this re-up to their 2014 edition, nothing in the world \u2014 the real one or the ones they've constructed \u2014 indicates a simple repeat of the song and dance they brought fans four years ago.\n\nFirst, the real world. Two years ago, Bey featured the mothers of slain black men and boys in her Lemonade short film. Just days before the 2016 presidential election, both lent their onstage support to Hillary Clinton during a rally in Cleveland, Ohio. Last fall, Jay addressed racist black stereotypes in his song \"The Story of O.J.\" from 4:44 \u2014 and like Beyonc\u00e9 , in the song's striking video (one of several). He also has a docu-series due out addressing the life and death of Trayvon Martin. All of these expressions have seemed to expand as the political fissures in this country and beyond have. As Jay-Z told Dean Baquet, executive editor of The New York Times in an interview last November: \"The great thing about Donald Trump being president is now we're forced to have the dialogue. Now we're having the conversation on the large scale; he's provided the platform for us to have the conversation.\" This country-hopping tour is a chance to further the dialogue and push their agendas on a stadium scale.\n\nSecond, just as the world that they've wrapped around has shifted, the pair have peeled back a parallel, more personal, fracture. Once an emblem of success and nearly-unattainable perfection, their relationship has very publicly become a more nuanced, realistic and relatable construction. Four years ago, when rumors of Jay's infidelity were still a low industry murmur, video surfaced of Solange kicking Jay-Z in an elevator leaving the Met Gala, an altercation that pierced the veil of perfection they had carefully constructed, complicating in a way that they couldn't, for once, control. Since then, Jay and Bey have (of course) seized the plot in their work, embracing its imperfections and interweaving their art more than ever before. On Beyonc\u00e9's Lemonade and Jay's subsequent 4:44, both addressed each other through themes \u2014 overt call-outs, really \u2014 of Jay's infidelity, Bey's forgiveness, broken trust, and domestic struggle. The albums both lean on the other for contextual support and stand on their own conceptual strength.\n\nTheir tour in 2014 opened with \"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\" \u2014 their first official collaboration \u2014 and its production and set list were more focused on accenting and hyping the other up as they jumped around their respective discographies that it was about a cohesive storyline. On the Run II is a chance to earnestly play out the narrative that those in the audience could actually see themselves in. It offers Beyonc\u00e9 a megaphone to speak her peace as her apologetic perpetrator stands by her side. Less aspiration, more confrontation. It makes you wonder how many at these shows will be living the same narrative.\n\nIf their dramatic storyline isn't used as stage direction, or their political agendas aren't addressed, the message of this tour will be a lost opportunity. But other than apartment buildings in DUMBO, neither are known for having many of those. Whatever happens, isn't getting back to business, together, the biggest stunt of all?", "keywords": ["jayz", "video", "baggage", "took", "jays", "addressed", "tour", "run", "beyonc\u00e9", "theyve", "world"], "polarity": 0.1076497113997114, "subjectivity": 0.343643217893218},

She's also the breakout star of this season of Love & Hip Hop: Miami. Most importantly, she's an Afro-Latina singer who won't compromise her blackness for her Latinidad.\n\n\"If I say I'm Afro-Latina, you'll automatically, visually in your mind see [that] I'm dark,\" Amara tells NPR's Shereen Marisol Meraji. \"And [in] my family we all speak Spanish, we're Latinos. This is my culture.\"\n\nWhile her distinct dancehall pop hooks and dembow rhythms have made hits out of songs like \"What A Bam Bam\" and \"Se Que Soy,\" Amara's storyline on Love & Hip-Hop: Miami is proof of how difficult it can be for Afro-Latinas to make it in the entertainment business.\n\nYouTube\n\nBorn in Miami, Fla., Amara La Negra grew up singing, dancing, and acting. \"Performing is what I was born to do, but it hasn't always been easy,\" she says.\n\nAmara remembers dealing with racism and colorism in entertainment since pre-school. At 4, she won a competition that landed her on the the wildly-successful Hispanic variety show, S\u00e1bado Gigante. For the six years she was on the show, Amara says she was the only dark-skinned child in the cast and that producers would always place her either way in the back of the stage or smack in the middle \"like a bug in the middle of a cup of milk.\"\n\nThe comments about Amara's appearance from people working on the show were constant. Amara's mother was often told her daughter's hair was unmanageable and needed to be permed.\n\n\"And I remember her looking at me and her face ... it was just letting me know that this was the beginning of the struggle,\" Amara says.\n\nAfter years of straightening perms, hot combs, and dieting Amara decided she was done policing her body. So she took the stage name Amara La Negra, \"love the black woman,\" and embraced her afro.\n\nAmara's mother, Ana Maria, encouraged her daughter to embrace her natural beauty. As a native of the Dominican Republic, Amara's mother came to the U.S. and raised the singer on her own in Miami. Ana Maria worked multiple jobs \u2014 cleaning houses, cooking, selling flowers on street corners \u2014 to pay for Amara's dance classes and singing lessons.\n\n\"I may have big dreams, but her dreams for me are even bigger,\" Amara says on Love & Hip Hop: Miami.\n\nAmara wants people watching her on TV to know that she doesn't live some fancy or glamorous life. More importantly, she wants people to know what she's up against in the music industry. She explains that racism and colorism run rampant in the business, and not just from white Americans, but from other Latinos, too. Amara proves this point early on the show when she meets with a Puerto Rican producer known as Young Hollywood.\n\n\"Instead of asking me about my music ... he was too concerned about my hair,\" she says. He told her to look \"a little bit more Beyonc\u00e9, a little less Macy Gray.\"\n\nThe Young Hollywood debacle sparked a conversation about colorism and the racist notion of mejorando la raza within the Latino community.\n\n\"I know that nobody wants to talk about it, but we suffer a lot of racism, we suffer a lot of colorism, amongst ourselves. You know, I get it all the time: 'Oh whenever you get married, don't get married to no black man because you want to better the race,'\" she says. \"Somebody needs to say something!\"\n\nAdolfo Cuevas, a professor at Tufts University who studies the cumulative effects of racism on the health of Afro-Latinos, is Afro-Dominican like Amara and says that while there's not much data on Afro-Latino health, there are disparities between black and white Latinos when it comes to health outcomes. Even when black Latinos have received higher education than white Latinos, they are statistically less likely to be employed. And when they are employed, they make less money. Afro-Latinos also report having more health issues in general, and higher levels of depression.\n\nAmara La Negra thinks more positive media representation can help heal the Afro-Latino community. Growing up, she remembers that Afro-Cuban salsa singer Celia Cruz was the only famous Afro-Latina who looked like her that she had to look up to.\n\n\"She was everything,\" Amara says. \"She was loud ... she was very humble, she was an amazing person.\"\n\nLike Cruz, Amara La Negra wants to be a role model for Afro-Latinas coming up in the industry today. Now, with new multi-album record deal, a doll collection in the works, and (with fingers crossed) a shot on the big screen, Amara is working to bridge the gap.\n\nWeb intern Stefanie Fern\u00e1ndez contributed to this story.", "keywords": ["afrolatinidad", "la", "know", "racism", "colorism", "latinos", "wants", "miami", "amara", "black", "negra", "amaras", "confronts"], "polarity": 0.14949999999999994, "subjectivity": 0.42683333333333334},

For its part, the Kyoto-based duo of Nice Legs is an homage to a throwaway line from \"the worst movie ever made,\" The Room, and a typically stilted little romantic scene between leading man Johnny (Tommy Wiseau) and his girlfriend, Lisa (Juliette Danielle):\n\nJOHNNY You have nice legs. (HE'S MUMBLING.) LISA (LISA IS TAPPING HIS SHOULDER.) You have nice pecs.\n\n\"I always thought it was really funny because it was very awkward just watching him talk to his girlfriend saying, 'You have nice legs,'\" Greg Sestero, who played Wiseau's friend Mark in the film, tells NPR Music. \"To me, his gesture of his hands to his hair is pretty funny. [The line] stood out to me, as well.\"\n\nNice Legs' band name is a particularly dedicated reflection of The Room's status as a newly minted cult classic, fueled by the film's mesmerizingly deficient directing, acting and plotting. But aside from its odd tone, at its heart lies the strangely heartwarming/disturbing friendship between Johnny and Mark, which worked, in part, because of the Wiseau and Sistero's real-life friendship. Their on-screen chemistry \u2014 if you care to call it that \u2014 is now being revisited in a new two-volume film, Best F(r)iends, directed by Justin MacGregor.\n\nWhen Nice Legs heard about the onscreen reunion, they sensed an opportunity.\n\n\"Basically, we saw that a new Tommy and Greg film was in production,\" band member Mark Lentz tells NPR Music. \"Then we dug around until we found the email of the production company.\" From there, he lobbed an email into the abyss. For six months, nothing but radio silence. Then: \"They responded out of the blue asking to work with us,\" he says. \"We took it as a good sign they opened the email with, 'Oh hai, Mark!'\"\n\nSestero and the producers heard a solid, dreamy fit in the music, so the film executives obliged the cheerful outfit and handed over an early cut, resulting in the galloping \"Mighty Three\" and the sinister \"End\" being featured in the trailer for the film.\n\nYouTube\n\n\"I think their voice is unique and different,\" Sestero says. \"It goes beyond obviously liking The Room and [naming] a band after The Room. I think their songs fit in the mood of the film and I think they have a great edge to them, which helps the film. You could have a band that's called You're Tearing Me Apart or other stuff, [and] it's unusable. But, luckily for us, their songs really were the right quality.\"\n\nNice Legs' homage wasn't only to The Room's practically avant-garde awkwardness: Lentz and his collaborator Lauren E. Walker saw a bit of themselves in Wiseau and Sestero's friendship, too.\n\n\"We are also quirky weirdos living on a dream,\" Walker says. Lentz and Walker were born a month apart in the same Little Rock, Arkansas hospital. A patchwork series of events led the two to meet for the first time in, of all places, a DIY art space in South Korea, where they formed Nice Legs in 2014. When Lentz got a job offer, the two made good on a blood oath to keep the band together, so they relocated to Kyoto, where they now both live as roommates.\n\n\"Like Tommy and Greg's famed meeting [in a San Francisco acting class], it sort of feels like destiny brought us together,\" she adds. \"As far as our relationship, I think it's similar to Tommy and Greg's in that we try to make up for our individual weaknesses by working together and playing on our strengths as a unit, and the chemistry of our friendship.\"\n\nBest F(r)iends dives deeper into Wiseau and Sestero's unique bond, within the form of L.A. noir. The trailer \u2014 dark colors, a brooding tone, a couple scarlet lines spelling out tumultuous waters ahead \u2014 is accompanied by Nice Legs' \"Mighty Three,\" almost surfy in its downcast guitar licks beneath both men repeating the phrase \"friendship before money.\"\n\nThe whole situation is already, appropriately, meta as hell; it's about two guys, by said two guys, partially soundtracked (Daniel Platzman from Imagine Dragons did the official score) by two people who named their band after the very same two guys.\n\n\"I'm really glad we didn't go with Nice Pecs,\" Lentz says. \"Now that would be strange.\"", "keywords": ["room", "tommy", "think", "pecs", "walker", "film", "propelled", "lentz", "nice", "wiseau", "friendship", "band", "luck", "tale", "legs"], "polarity": 0.20549288806431662, "subjectivity": 0.6204073902288185},

The sarcastically titled \"Purim Gifts for Hitler,\" named after a holiday celebrating the Jews' survival of Haman's attempt to massacre them in biblical times, struck a more defiant tone. \"You're not my first enemy; before you I've had many others,\" the lyrics went. \"Your bleary end will be on Haman's tree, while the Jewish people live on and on.\"\n\nThese songs, along with hundreds of others, were collected for an archive of lyrics by amateur Jewish authors in the Soviet Union during World War II and documented by a team of researchers from the Cabinet of Jewish Culture from the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, which operated under the auspices of the Soviet government. They describe the Jewish wartime experience, telling tales not just of Holocaust survivors but of Jewish soldiers in the Red Army, women working in factories on the home front and Polish refugees building new lives in far-flung corners of the Soviet empire.\n\n\"They don't have any parallels in other collections of Holocaust music,\" says Anna Shternshis, a professor of Yiddish studies for the University of Toronto, who first visited the archive at its present home, the Vernadsky National Library in Kiev, in 2010.\n\ntoggle caption Courtesy of Six Degrees Records\n\nNow, thanks to Shternshis' efforts, new versions of 17 songs from that archive have been released, on an album called Yiddish Glory: The Lost Songs of World War II. Recorded in Toronto with a group of musicians and vocalists led by Russian Jewish singer-songwriter Psoy Korolenko, the project is a bold act of what Shternshis and album producer Daniel Rosenberg call \"musical archaeology\" \u2014 re-creating songs by amateur storytellers whose original melodies were often lost.\n\nThat these songs weren't entirely lost is something of a minor miracle. After World War II, Soviet dictator Josef Stalin's policies grew increasingly anti-Semitic, and Jewish political leaders, authors and academics were imprisoned and, in many cases, tortured and executed. Most members of the Cabinet of Jewish Culture \u2014 including their leader, Ukrainian Jewish ethnomusicologist Moisei Beregovsky \u2014 were arrested and sent to Siberian gulags.\n\nFor decades, it was presumed that Soviet authorities had destroyed the documentary work of Beregovsky's team. But in 1993, a few years after Ukraine gained its independence from the fracturing Soviet Union, they were discovered in unmarked boxes at the Vernadsky National Library.\n\n\"They were kind of half-hidden,\" says Lyudmila Sholokhova, a research associate at the library at the time the archive was rediscovered and who is now a director at the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research in New York City. Though Sholokhova spent several years studying and cataloging the collection \u2014 which included not just World War II-era songs but thousands of Yiddish folk songs, stories and physical artifacts dating to the 1920s, when Beregovsky had first begun his research \u2014 its existence and importance remained largely unknown to all but a small handful of Yiddish scholars and historians, including Shternshis.\n\n\"Soviet archives are stupendous sources\" for Holocaust research, says Bret Werb, music and sound collection curator for the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C. Werb, who visited the archive in 1998, says it is especially valuable because members of Beregovsky's team \u2014 who, along with hundreds of thousands of other refugees, fled to Soviet central Asia when their home republic became a war zone \u2014 went back to Ukraine immediately after it was liberated from the Nazis in 1944. There, they collected songs and stories from recently freed Jewish concentration camp prisoners and other survivors.\n\nThe ordeals of Ukrainian Jews are not well-documented, partly because of Soviet censorship and partly because of the astonishing death tolls. Of the 1.5 million Jews living in Ukraine at the start of the war, over 900,000 perished \u2014 and many of the remaining 600,000 either fled the republic or served in the Red Army. In some German-occupied areas, according to Shternshis, the survival rate among those who stayed behind was less than 1 percent.\n\n\"Knowledge of these places, the knowledge of what happened during the war, is still not where it should be,\" says Shternshis. When she and Korolenko chose the songs that appear on Yiddish Glory, \"the important thing was to give voices to people we rarely hear.\"\n\nAnother of these voices belonged to Golda Rovinskaya, a 73-year-old who was \"probably one of 150,000 Jews from Kiev who survived World War II in the Soviet rear \u2014 central Asia, maybe Siberia,\" according to Shternshis. Beregovsky's team documented her in 1947 singing a song about the massacre at Babi Yar, a ravine near Kiev in which more than 33,000 Jews were executed over two days in 1941. \"Oh, blood gushed out from all sides,\" her lyrics read. \"The earth was stained red from blood.\"\n\nAs with most of the songs on Yiddish Glory, no recording or musical notation of Rovinskaya's song survives. But according to the notes Beregovsky left behind for a book he was preparing to publish before his arrest, all of the melodies were based on traditional Yiddish folk songs or popular Soviet music. That clue was what inspired Korolenko, who holds a Ph.D. in Russian literature and has what Shternshis calls an \"encyclopedic knowledge of Yiddish music and Soviet music of the 1940s,\" to base most of the melodies on Yiddish Glory on songs that would have been well-known in Ukraine at the time.\n\n\"When I first got the texts, I started to virtually listen to them in my head as melodies,\" he explains. Based on their cadence or word choices, \"sometimes they clearly indicated a popular Yiddish song. But often, they rather sounded in the spirit of some Soviet patriotic songs, or they sounded like a weird mixture of vaguely recognizable tunes in the spirit of '30s and '40s [Russian and Ukrainian music].\"\n\n\"Because Anna and Psoy are experts, they could look at the lyrics\" and infer what their melodies might be, explains producer Rosenberg, a journalist and radio host who took an interest in the project after hearing Korolenko perform the songs solo on a piano. \"The music was so powerful, we wanted to do it right,\" he says of the fuller arrangements on Yiddish Glory, which were done by Russian Roma violinist Sergei Erdenko, who also plays and sings on the album. \"Some of these songs are just so devastating, and the researchers went to jail for [collecting them]. So we really wanted to honor them.\"\n\nMany of the album's traditional Yiddish melodies will be familiar to fans of klezmer, but it's the Soviet wartime melodies and their often bloodthirsty lyrics that make for some of Yiddish Glory's most striking moments. On \"Taybl's Letter to Her Husband at the Front,\" a 28-year-old tailor making uniforms in the Soviet rear urges her husband in the Red Army to \"slash them, smash them, have no mercy / Take revenge for us all / [So that] all the Germans may lie deep, deep in the earth.\" Set to the tune of \"Tachanka\" (\"Tank\"), a Soviet patriotic song popular in the late '30s, the Yiddish Glory version is elegantly sung by Sophie Milman, a celebrated Canadian jazz vocalist of Russian Jewish descent who appears on one-third of Yiddish Glory.\n\nThe album isn't the only recent project to unearth Jewish music from World War II and the Holocaust that had been lost for decades. In Jerusalem in April, a group of musicians, led by Italian composer and pianist Francesco Lotoro, will play pieces written by Jewish composers in labor and concentration camps, which Lotoro has spent the past 30 years collecting. Many of the music's authors died in the camps, but their compositions were smuggled out in the form of manuscripts or committed to memory by survivors, some of whom Lotoro tracked down and interviewed for his project. Most of the works at the performance, titled \"Notes of Hope,\" are being heard publicly for the first time.\n\nYouTube\n\nFor the people bringing this lost music back to life, the current political climate has brought an added sense of urgency to their efforts. A recent report by the Anti-Defamation League says that anti-Semitic activities in the U.S. increased by 57 percent last year, including sharp increases in the number of bomb threats, acts of vandalism and other incidents of intimidation and harassment. \"We've got people running for office right now, here in this country, who deny the Holocaust ever happened,\" says Bob Duskis, co-owner of the San Fransisco-based label Six Degrees, which is releasing Yiddish Glory. \"So this kind of [music] continues to be very relevant and very important.\"\n\nThe six musicians and four vocalists featured on Yiddish Glory have performed its music for a live audience only once, at a concert in Toronto in early 2016. Shternshis and Korolenko are hopeful that some version of the full band will eventually be able to tour in support of the album (though it will have to be without Alexander Sevastian, a world-class accordionist who died of a heart attack at age 41, just a week before the album's release). In the meantime, they are bringing Yiddish Glory to college campuses and other academic institutions as a two-person show. Korolenko plays the songs on a piano and Shternshis provides backstory and historical commentary between songs. (They will perform next at the Center for Jewish History in New York City on April 9, Purdue University on April 23 and Northwestern University's Chicago campus on May 7.)\n\nAt a recent appearance at the University of California, Irvine, presented by the school's Center for Jewish Studies under the title \"Last Yiddish Heroes,\" they began the program with \"Babi Yar.\" Korolenko, in a black suit, his curly graying hair tied back in a ponytail, played the song with stately care on a Steinway grand, delivering its horrifying Yiddish lyrics in an almost matter-of-fact tone as a projection screen above him translated them into English. The audience, a mix of young undergrads and older Jewish couples and families, listened, rapt; by the song's end, more than a few were dabbing their eyes.\n\nThe songs are sad, yes, but also celebratory; when Korolenko and Shternshis end their program with a victory song called \"Happy New Year 1944,\" many in the audience are clapping along and laughing heartily at the song's punchline, which bids Hitler to \"kiss our asses.\" (It sounds funnier with the Yiddish word for ass, tuchis.)\n\n\"This is the Jewish experience, the Soviet experience, the human experience,\" Korolenko says. \"It's part of our lives in the current context and the context of history. This is great, to give voice to these people.\"", "keywords": ["shternshis", "korolenko", "jewish", "music", "youre", "enemy", "soviet", "pain", "war", "yiddish", "glory", "defiance", "song", "wwii", "longlost", "songs"], "polarity": 0.0863077417896695, "subjectivity": 0.36376045306768195},

At its peak as a mecca for music lovers, Tower boasted stores and licensees across the U.S., with its signature yellow-and-red signs also blazing in London, Buenos Aires and Tokyo. Music fans and musicians alike made pilgrimages to Tower's stores. As Bruce Springsteen said in All Things Must Pass, director Colin Hanks' 2015 documentary about the chain, \"If you came into town, you went to Tower Records.\"\n\nIts successes spurred the expansion of other music mega-retailers like HMV and Virgin. Each of its stores had a unique retail profile, often tied to its geographical location: the store in Nashville, for example, offered a huge selection of country music, while the Tower next to Lincoln Center in New York City boasted an unparalleled stock of classical titles.\n\nBut in 2006, Tower declared bankruptcy.\n\nThe chain's decline was a long time in its making: Solomon and his team didn't anticipate how fast the revolution from physical products to digital downloads was going to come. File-sharing sites like Napster were proliferating. Big-box stores like Target, Wal-Mart and Best Buy were selling high-volume, popular CDs at sizable discounts. Tower couldn't afford to match the big-box stores' sale prices, and Solomon couldn't persuade the record labels to lower their prices, or to get them to start selling CD singles rather than full albums.\n\nIn the meantime, Tower racked up debt to the tune of $110 million, in hopes of driving even more international expansion.

Entering the space between desire and communion, bondage and freedom, or grief and comfort, songs reinforce the reassuring magic of cinema. They resolve fundamental conflicts; in Monday night's best picture winner The Shape of Water, a song is what, controversially to some, allows the mute heroine Eliza to not only express but to realize her lust for her forbidden amphibian lover. They also prime the stage for more believable, yet still idealized, awakenings, as when the titular heroine of Sunday's snubbed critical favorite, Lady Bird, first processes and then rises above heartache via the resonantly tacky Dave Matthews ballad \"Crash Into Me.\"\n\nThis use of songs comes from musical theater, in which forward motion mostly occurs when propelled by rhythm and melody. Just one well-placed song in an otherwise non-musical film can become a kind of pseudo-realistic special effect. From the classic (Ingrid Bergman conjuring Humphrey Bogart with \"As Time Goes By\" in Casablanca) to the comical (Lili Taylor talking back to her lousy, lying ex in Say Anything with \"Joe Lies\") to the inspirational (Ledisi, as Mahalia Jackson, soothing David Oyelowo's Martin Luther King, Jr. over the phone with \"Precious Lord\" in Selma), songs accomplish the seemingly impossible.\n\nThis year's nominees for best song, and the performances that brought them to life at Sunday's awards ceremony, communicated the form's purpose in film better than usual. Three were inspirational, and their staging spoke beyond the frames of the films where they originated to address the current political mood. Common and Andra Day performed the hip-hop anthem \"Stand Up for Something,\" from Marshall, with ten well-known political activists occupying spotlights behind them. Keala Settle embodied proud unconventional beauty, singing her bearded-lady aria \"This Is Me,\" from The Greatest Showman, as a pointedly multicultural dance troupe struck defiant poses behind her. And Mary J. Blige, the mother of hip-hop self-empowerment, sang her and Raphael Saadiq's touching country-soul hymn \"Mighty River\" in front of projected images from her own nominated performance in Mudbound, paying tribute to her own role in diversifying Hollywood.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Kevin Winter/Getty Images Kevin Winter/Getty Images\n\nUplift is the stuff of awards shows, and though these performances all delivered in ways that aptly reflected the Academy's progressive veneer, they provided little insight into what song really does in great films. That was left to the night's two ballads \u2014 the ultimate winner and, in the minds of many music critics, its chief rival.\n\nCoco's \"Remember Me,\" which took the prize, is not only a constant presence in Pixar's tribute to Mexican family rituals, it's the pivotal element in the movie's story of personal and cultural reclamation. Written by the wandering patriarch Hector \u2014 Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez in real life \u2014 for the toddler daughter he left to pursue his music, \"Remember Me\" weaves throughout the movie like a winding echo of love grown at home, only to be thwarted by outside forces. The song works in the most private way, as a lullaby, and in the most public, as a hit single that both brings Mexican flavor to the world and distorts its music's origins in community. Sung by nearly every main character in a complicated expression of cultural heritage, \"Remember Me\" is the story of Mexican culture itself as it is interpreted and misinterpreted in the mainstream. (Interestingly, as in The Shape of Water, it's also the thing that helps a long-mute woman \u2013 that daughter, Coco, now a grandmother \u2013 regain her voice). More than just another sappy Disney singalong, \"Remember Me\" absolutely deserved its win for honoring the bolero-ranchero tradition as it's grounded in both family ties and Mexican pride.\n\nThe song's spectacular Oscars staging mostly stressed the latter, with the Blaxican heartthrob Miguel and the Mexico City-based soprano Natalia Lafourcade duetting bilingually as sombrero'd and Jalisco-beskirted dancers performed hat dances behind them. But the key moment came earlier on, when Gael Garcia Bernal, who voices Hector in the film, sang the lullaby portion accompanied only by acoustic guitar. His pitch was shaky, his demeanor somewhat timid. But those imperfections told Coco's deepest story: that of the toll of exile and the lies history can tell, and the way ritual heals and renews the family bonds that fight against those larger forces. Garcia-Bernal was the night's most intimate truth-teller, his murmur of \"remember me\" a plea directed not only toward his fictional family, but for America itself to acknowledge its Mexican DNA.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Kevin Winter/Getty Images Kevin Winter/Getty Images\n\nAlso speaking in a near-whisper, though a much more cultivated one, was Sufjan Stevens, whose \"Mystery of Love\" is the elegiac love theme in the swooningly lush coming-of-age story Call Me By Your Name. Lucio Guadagnino's tender idyll between the teenage Elio and the graduate student Oliver (which won an Oscar for its screenwriter, James Ivory, the octogenarian master of such summer dreams) enacts its politics erotically, translating Andre Aciman's beloved novel into a paean to the signaled, the whispered, and the finally unspoken. Among other things, the film is a lament about the era of the closet. Its touchmarks \u2013 classical Greek statue, New Wave music, and, yes, Merchant-Ivory films \u2013 expressed what was once suppressed in Hollywood and everywhere. The three Stevens songs in the film inhabit that absence of open acknowledgment, and the magical, provisional openness its two main characters fleetingly achieve, with grace of classic Hollywood: they are his \"As Time Goes By.\"\n\nStevens's music primarily dwells in the same space of memory, loss and longing that Elio occupies at the end of Call Me By Your Name. The singer's own refusal to make public a fixed sexual orientation is a personal decision that enhances the hazily romantic aura of his songs. He is a remarkably precise lyricist \u2013 \"whoa is me,\" he repeats in \"Mystery of Love,\" exactly capturing the feeling of adolescent awakening \u2014 who smears Vaseline on the lens of his sharp insights to make them glamorously universal. He's perfect for Hollywood, and at the Oscars, in his pink and blue suit, he delivered a short, perfect rendition of his song.\n\nNo dancers for Stevens \u2014 and yet he too found a way to connect with the evening's seeming mandate to make a socially progressive statement. His band consisted of six collaborators. Three were white men: his regular partners Casey Foubert and James McAlister, Thomas Bartlett (aka Doveman) and Chris Thile, who gave the performance a through line with his fleet work on mandolin. But Stevens was flanked by two special guests: Annie Clark, otherwise known as St. Vincent, and Moses Sumney. These two category-defying, singer-songwriter-instrumentalists, in glamorous black that offset Stevens's gender-decategorizing color palette, stood for the future of popular music, beyond traditional gender roles or sexual designations. If Call Me By Your Name is about the moments when desire emerges from its smoke screens to become perfectly clear, Stevens' performance brilliantly understated that clarity in a call to recognize both virtuosity and glamor in new ways. His songs may live in the gap between longing and resolution, but his Oscar moment spoke for a future in which people can be genuine, open and free.", "keywords": ["delivered", "cinematic", "remember", "music", "wintergetty", "kevin", "film", "possibilities", "oscars", "love", "best", "song", "mexican", "stevens", "forms", "nominees", "songs"], "polarity": 0.1959915373977874, "subjectivity": 0.49318164474414483},
