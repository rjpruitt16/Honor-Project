Sitting with her arm casually draped across the back of a parlor chair, she\u2019s wearing an elegant bodice and a full skirt with a fitted waist. Her posture and facial expression remind us that historical figures are far more complex than most people realize. This adds significantly to what we know about this fierce abolitionist. And that\u2019s a good thing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe album was originally created as a gift for Emily Howland, a Quaker schoolteacher and abolitionist who lived in Sherwood, N.Y., just a few minutes away from Tubman herself.

Not because her distinct sound of music sounded as if one of God\u2019s angels drank a fifth of gin and figured out a way to plug an extension cord into its harp. It wasn\u2019t because I was listening to something that was recorded in the 1930s that sounded like Prince had laid it down in a studio yesterday.\n\nIt was the erasure.\n\nBecause not finding out about Sister Rosetta Tharpe\u2019s existence until my third decade on the planet meant everything could be a lie. If an intentional omission can delete an entire human being from history, then nothing means anything.\n\nThe title of this article is not hyperbole. It is truth. It is an indisputable fact.\n\nInvent: (verb) to create or design (something that has not existed before)\n\nIt is as simple as this: What we know as rock \u2019n\u2019 roll did not exist before Sister Rosetta Tharpe. She came before Elvis and Johnny Cash. She preceded Chuck Berry and Little Richard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen most music historians are asked who invented this class of music, many will name one of the previously mentioned rock stars. The most respectful and thoughtful will say it was a combination of these men.\n\nBut every single one of those men, including Little Richard, will tell you that the first person from whom they heard the sound with which we have become familiar was Rosetta Tharpe.\n\nIn his induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Johnny Cash said that she was his favorite singer growing up. Little Richard called her his greatest influence. Chuck Berry said that his entire career was just \u201cone long Rosetta Tharpe impersonation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA PBS documentary on her life called her the \u201cgodmother of rock and roll.\u201d She is still called the \u201cforgotten mother\u201d of the genre and \u201cthe most influential artist ever.\u201d\n\nMaybe she is overlooked because she was technically a gospel singer (because rock didn\u2019t exist yet, remember?). Perhaps Tharpe\u2019s blackness has something to do with the fact that she wasn\u2019t elected to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame until 2017. Or her queerness. Or the fact that she was a woman.\n\nMusic authorities argue about a handful of songs recorded between 1946 and 1952 when discussing what might be the first rock \u2019n\u2019 roll song ever, the most popular of which is \u201cRocket 88\u201d by Jackie Brenston and His Delta Cats, recorded in 1952.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Oct. 31, 1938, when Elvis was 3 years old, when Chuck Berry was 12, when Little Richard (who is rarely disputed when he says he \u201cinvented\u201d rock \u2019n\u2019 roll) was 6 years old, and when Jackie Brenston and His Delta Cats were still kittens, Sister Rosetta Tharpe recorded this song for posterity:\n\n\u201cMusic authorities\u201d are a motherfucking lie.\n\nOnce more, for the people in the back: Sister Rosetta Tharpe invented rock \u2019n\u2019 roll.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRosetta Nubin was born in 1915 in Cotton Plant, Ark. By the time she was 6 years old, she was performing in churches around the South with her mother. After moving to Chicago as a child, Rosetta married a Church of God in Christ preacher named Thomas Tharpe after she became a renowned gospel musician in the COGIC community. Rosetta would divorce her husband after a few years, but she kept the surname as her stage moniker.\n\nDuring a time when the idea of a guitar-playing woman was nonexistent, not only did Rosetta Tharpe erase this line by mastering the symbol of musical masculinity, but her blend of gospel and secular music was seen as earth-shattering. Her willingness to play \u201cGod\u2019s music\u201d in the devil\u2019s den of nightclubs and music halls caused an uproar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter a move to New York, she began playing with some of the biggest bands in the country, including Duke Ellington\u2019s. By the time she was 23, she had a recording contract, and recorded Decca Record\u2019s first gospel songs in 1938, including the hit song \u201cRock Me.\u201d\n\nWhen people heard her music, Tharpe became an overnight sensation, and her music became the first gospel music to ever top Billboard\u2019s \u201crace\u201d charts, an accomplishment she achieved several times during her career. People often commented that she \u201cplayed like a man,\u201d to which Tharpe often replied: \u201cCan\u2019t no man play like me. I play better than a man.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though she was playing venues like Carnegie Hall and the Cotton Club with legendary acts such as Cab Calloway, Tharpe longed to get back to the gospel music circuit. After meeting gospel singer Marie Knight in 1946, Tharpe entered into a relationship with Knight and lived openly in the relationship until it ended in 1951.\n\nWith the move to folk music and the British invasion that rejuvenated musicians of her era in the 1960s and 1970s, Tharpe didn\u2019t get the same bump that male blues musicians did because she continued to stick to gospel-themed music. She died during a recording session on Oct. 9, 1973, when she suffered her second stroke.\n\nSister Rosetta Tharpe was not an unknown, hidden little secret. She was such a huge star, she had her third wedding in a stadium where 25,000 people attended. Yet she was somehow erased from the history of music.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost reasonable music historians will tell you that one person shouldn\u2019t receive credit for an entire genre. While it is true that not every single musician who ever played rock \u2019n\u2019 roll was inspired by Rosetta Tharpe, it is also true that there is not a single rock musician playing in the year 2018 doing something that Rosetta Tharpe wasn\u2019t doing 80 years ago.\n\nShe did it first.\n\nThat\u2019s what \u201cinvent\u201d means.", "keywords": ["little", "woman", "black", "invented", "gospel", "queer", "n", "tharpe", "roll", "recorded", "sister", "rosetta", "rock", "music"], "polarity": 0.1496963272648204, "subjectivity": 0.41634841566348413},

For this collection, Jean-Raymond collaborated with both Reebok and \u201990s hip-hop brand Cross Colours, leveraging big-brand distribution and recognition for the heavy financial lifting required to bring a fully realized collection to market\u2014and as a vehicle for some seriously good clothes.\n\nThese are clothes that don\u2019t need nostalgia to usher them forward, but instead are forward-thinking in using both patriotism and the Western theme that\u2019s become a dominant trend this New York Fashion Week as a flashpoint for conversation about the current political landscape and how African Americans continue to define the history of this country.\n\nJohn Lamparski/Getty Images John Lamparski/Getty Images John Lamparski/Getty Images John Lamparski/Getty Images John Lamparski/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images 1 / 22\n\nDown the runway came loose button-down shirts paired with stovepipe leather trousers, top-stitched patchwork suits (in a nod to both denim and quilting bees) and elegant, crystal-pleated pants that elevated baggy trousers to a whole new level. Louche and easy-shearling jackets looked perfect over satin slip dresses\u2014and don\u2019t sleep on the block-pleat finish at the hem, either.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s difficult for any designer to make Western wear feel new; generally, it\u2019s either rehash or a costume. For Pyer Moss, designer Jean-Raymond did well to channel Wild Bill Pickett, the early-20th-century black cowboy who invented bulldogging\u2014where rodeo riders literally take the bull by the horns and wrestle it to the ground. That, coupled with the use of a blown-up Stars and Stripes motif on blanket-sized scarves and then again in furry coat linings, seemed both a subversive statement and also a declaration of love for America and all that our country has the potential to be.\n\nSince the label\u2019s inception, Pyer Moss has composed clothes like hip-hop songs\u2014sampling beloved nostalgic influences like Cross Colours\u2014with whom designer Jean-Raymond confirmed to Vogue that a full collection is on the way. Until then, we can swoon over his current collection\u2019s mix of floor-length fun furs over hoodies and joggers for the weekend, and, for the office, patchwork jackets over tuck-pleated, high-waisted pants that give the illusion of chaps.

Pence\u2019s snubbing of black people happened on the same day President Donald Trump talked as if Frederick Douglass, abolitionist, writer and civil rights leader, were still alive (he died in 1895). Later in the month, U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos said that HBCUs were \u201cpioneers\u201d of \u201cschool choice\u201d (colleges were segregated).\n\n\n\nIt was a sign of things to come.\n\n\n\nBy Pence\u2019s standard, Trump made black history in his first year as president by waging an assault on voting rights through his now-defunct voting-fraud commission, calling white supremacists \u201cfine people\u201d after the Charlottesville, Va., march and, more recently, disparaging Haiti, El Salvador and African countries as \u201cshithole countries.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe should all be appalled at the administration\u2019s ignorance around race, but we should be not surprised. Racism is taught. And when white history is the standard, when history is told from the point of view of white people, you might well believe, as failed U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore does, that slavery was good for black people.\n\n\n\nThe flagrant ignorance and blatant racism of the Trump administration makes clearer what black celebrities such as Morgan Freeman and Stacey Dash mean (or so we hope) when they say, \u201cI don\u2019t want Black History Month.\u201d It\u2019s obvious that black history is needed all year long. But white history as we know it can no longer be the standard in a multicultural society, which is supposed to maximize the potential of all its members.\n\n\n\nThe late, great historian Carter G. Woodson started Negro History Week in 1926 with hopes that black people would be proud of their heritage and that mainstream America would recognize the contributions of its black residents. While millions of students across the country now study the influences of black people and culture in what has evolved into Black History Month, Trump proves regularly that Woodson\u2019s ultimate goal of integrating black history into our core curricula fell far short of national acceptance.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe danger in relegating black history to a month is that it becomes horribly contained to a month. Ask your child, colleague or friend to say a few brief words about Woodson, sing the first few lines of \u201cthe black national anthem\u201d or identify five African countries during the rest of the months and there\u2019s a strong possibility that you\u2019ll think you\u2019re talking to a version of Trump.\n\nBlack contributions to society are not being recognized in the pantheon of American history. Worse, this lack of recognition is reflected in national policy, racial inequities in compensation and the discounting of black leadership. Unequal pay is a blatant, empirical sign of a devaluation of worth.\n\n\n\nYou obviously can\u2019t blame the devaluation of black people on Black History Month. As a young person, I remember learning about renowned surgeon Ben Carson at a BLM event and how he became the first to successfully separate twins at the head. I listened to Carson with admiration and pride at another such event when he narrated, with great aplomb, the exact stops along the neural pathway from a touch of the finger to the brain and back again. It\u2019s a shtick I would hear many times, with the same reaction.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut when Carson, as U.S. secretary of housing and urban development, referred to slaves as \u201cimmigrants\u201d last year during a departmental junket with employees, he proved that there\u2019s nothing wrong with BLM. Carson, too, could not detach the white-centric history he learned in school from his own brain.\n\n\n\nNo wonder, when he probably also studied those whitewashed stories of Christopher Columbus \u201cdiscovering\u201d America (no matter the millions of Native Americans already living here), which are buttressed by tales of how the Pilgrims supposedly sat down with the Indians for a delightful supper (already part of their harvest tradition).\n\nWhen slavery is covered in history class, the teaching of black benign servitude too often goes along with ideas that the Ku Klux Klan is a Christian organization exhibiting principles like loving thy neighbor. We have statues of Confederate heroes\u2014i.e., racist traitors\u2014littered throughout the U.S., particularly in the South. And of course, Abraham Lincoln didn\u2019t have a racist bone in his body.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe misrepresenting of colonization, slavery and racists is behind the racism and ignorance of Trump and people like him, not Black History Month.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m indebted to the people, places and traditions I\u2019ve been introduced to in February. I have received numerous invitations to speak at BLM events, and I will continue to highlight black accomplishments in my columns during February. Calling for mainstream inclusion isn\u2019t a charge to end BLM. In fact, we can use it to introduce more recent history and fresh faces.\n\n\n\nFor instance, if there is a book by a black author that you must read this month, take in Stamped From the Beginning: The Definitive History of Racist Ideas in America, by Ibram X. Kendi, winner of the 2016 National Book Award for nonfiction. Kendi\u2019s book provides a thorough reading of U.S. history from the perspective of black people. He moves Woodson\u2019s legacy forward, along with those of other notable historians who are still alive, such as James D. Anderson, Robin D.G. Kelley, Henry Louis Gates Jr., Blair L.M. Kelley and Paula Giddings. There are people who continue to write outside of white standards, to our collective benefit. But to reap the social fruits of their labor, we must remove the standard of white-centric history.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGetting to a place where we can make history more inclusive is not easy. In fact, it\u2019s a thoroughly radical endeavor that first requires society to acknowledge that history is not an impartial narration of events as they occurred. It is, rather, the story as told by the people who are telling it. Retelling our history requires acknowledging that the American identity is rooted in a false narrative that makes the exhortation to \u201cMake America great again\u201d an oxymoron (for the people who were brought here as slaves, it was never all that great to begin with).\n\n\n\nMany multicultural-education advocates have promoted curricula that expand the perspectives in American history. The pushback to the ethnic-studies and multicultural-education movements is about protecting white history. University faculty have much more leeway as to their text selection, but people of color are severely underrepresented in the full-time teaching ranks. And core undergraduate curriculums are guarded by traditions, professional (read: white) standards and faculty who were trained in accordance with them.\n\n\n\nRemoving racist history books will be harder than shuttling Confederate monuments to the backs of museums. Neither important act is about erasing history\u2014it\u2019s about making it. Woodson wanted to see black history infused into American history because they\u2019re one and the same. But he also wanted the idolatry of whiteness removed from America\u2019s sight.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis story was produced by the Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education, in partnership with The Root.", "keywords": ["white", "cant", "slavery", "single", "great", "relegated", "racist", "national", "black", "trump", "standard", "history", "month", "shouldnt"], "polarity": 0.04301038843721771, "subjectivity": 0.38613803766242794},

Captained by William Foster, the Clotilda unloaded its precious cargo: 110 kidnapped human beings.\n\n\n\nWhen federal authorities discovered that Timothy Meaher, a wealthy Mobile plantation owner, had made a bet with his friends that he could sneak a shipment of slaves into the country, they decided to investigate the crime. To hide their misdeeds, Foster rushed to the Clotilda and set it on fire. The vessel sank to the bottom of the ocean, never to be seen again.\n\nNow AL.com reports that one of its reporters, Ben Raines, may have discovered the last slave ship in American buried in the mud of the lower Mobile-Tensaw Delta. The ship would normally have been covered by the water, but the unusually northern winds from the recent \u201cbomb cyclone\u201d on the Eastern Seaboard reduced the tide in Mobile Bay to 2 1/2 feet below its normal depth, revealing the ship to Raines.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m quaking with excitement.

Lewis came to the country on the Clotilda and was the last survivor of the mid-Atlantic slave trade.\n\nLewis spent five years as the property of Meaher. After he was emancipated, Lewis, along with other former slaves from his ship, demanded reparations. When they were denied, he and a group of slaves put their money together and founded the African-centered town of Africatown, located a few miles from Mobile. A new book by Hurston, Barracoon, about Lewis, will be released on May 5 by HarperCollins.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf Raines\u2019 find turns out to be the Clotilda, it may be one of the biggest and most important artifacts documenting the African slave trade.

I have zero science to back this up; nor do I have a link to a white paper from the Atlanta Conference of Negro Problems\u2019 (that was a real thing, by the way) early writings that proves this axiom dating back to the 1870s. Truth is, some shit is just true.\n\nWhich is why I\u2019m glad I was raised in a black household. There were things I grew up with and learned that I likely wouldn\u2019t have gotten had I grown up in any other circumstance. Also, you like how I properly used the term axiom?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyway, here are 10 reasons I\u2019m glad I was raised in a black household.\n\n1. I grew up listening to Luther Vandross.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine living in a world where I had to discover the greatness of Luther as an adult and then actively think about all the years I missed out on having that music in my life. As a youth, while I was living with my white mother, we listened to a veritable cornucopia of music, including black music. But in white households, that means Michael Jackson and Jimi Hendrix. My mother also has an affinity for Peaches & Herb\u2014\u201cReunited,\u201d to be specific.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut once I moved to live with my pops, I got nonstop Motown, Stax, Luther, Aretha and all the great music that spoke more directly to my soul than ZZ Top and AC/DC\u2014both groups I enjoy, but it\u2019s just ... different. To be fair, my father also had a penchant for Kenny G, and Rod Stewart was never too far. Nobody\u2019s perfect.\n\n2. I learned that when you see other people start running, you start running.\n\nI don\u2019t know what \u201cGet the fuck out of Dodge\u201d procedures are taught in other cultures or if any are taught at all. I do know that somewhere along the way, the words \u201cAnd boy, if you see a group of people running, you run in the same direction and you don\u2019t stop to ask no questions or find out what\u2019s going on until you see 75 to 96 percent of everybody else stop\u201d were passed to me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. I grew up on a significant number of black movies.\n\nIF there was a movie with mostly black people in it, we were watching it. From The Last Dragon to The Wiz. Of course, we watched anything with Eddie Murphy\u2014as did everybody, apparently. Did you know that Coming to America did nearly $300 million in 1988?! But I know who Sho\u2019nuff is, and even though I think the movie is trash, the soundtrack to The Wiz is amazeballs.\n\n4. Seasoning, seasoning everywhere.\n\nThis is one of those stereotypical things that I\u2019ve accepted as fact even though my proof is akin to the proof white folks needed to convict black men in the \u201950s. The only time I\u2019ve eaten white cooking has largely been when I was with my white mother during the summers, and she loved her some seasoning. Other than that, I can\u2019t actually say that I spent much time in any white people\u2019s households long enough to eat their cooking. Now that I think about this, I\u2019m not sure if this is sad or God\u2019s grace. Maybe it\u2019s both. Clearly, I don\u2019t know enough white people. Or any outside of family, really. In terms of other cultures, I know they be seasoning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. I grew up with a healthy fear of my parents.\n\nI\u2019m not saying other folks didn\u2019t, but I have children, which means I\u2019ve been to children\u2019s birthday parties and outings where other adults interacted with their children. Or even better: Last month, I had to fly to Detroit for a family situation. When I flew back to Washington, D.C., as I was walking through the TSA Precheck line (FTMFW!), a family of four was in front of me.\n\nThere was a bowl of peppermints available to folks in the line, and the mom made some remark about her maybe-12-year-old son and eating peppermints. This little white child yelled out, \u201cMom, you\u2019re SUCH A JERK SOMETIMES!\u201d Do you know the mom looked at me as if to see if anybody noticed, and I just shook my head?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, my black mother is a super-friendly, very nice, God-fearing woman who embarrasses easy when her very loud children (me and one of my sisters) get to the shenanigans. But do you know what I would NEVER fathom doing for fear of this woman who hasn\u2019t put a foreign object on me since fifth grade? Calling her a jerk or anything outside of her name ever\u2014but especially publicly.\n\nFor one, what if that sent her over the edge? For b, what if she said, \u201cI\u2019m gonna tell your father\u201d? That man listens to Kenny G. He\u2019s capable of anything. That little white boy yelled this IN FRONT of both his parents AT his mother. I\u2019m just saying. I\u2019ve got fear in my heart ... of my parents. It might not be a UNIVERSAL black trait, but I got it from my black-hand side.\n\n6. Life was one big-ass black history lesson.\n\nSure, we watched fun stuff, but my parents also made us watch movies about historical atrocities committed against black people. I remember watching a documentary on the Scottsboro Boys over and over again. Black books were around, and we had a black encyclopedia set and black-Jesus-centric Bible (still do).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m sure in some homes, the talk about being a black man in America went something like, \u201cAight Ja\u2019Rome, get your black ass killed tonight by some cracka-ass-cracka white cop because YOU think it\u2019s a good idea to act like you ain\u2019t go\u2019 no damn sense hanging out there with DonQ\u2019uestajuan, Black and Lil Jimmy from 41st.\u201d In others, it wasn\u2019t so succinct and required a lot more subtlety and nuance.\n\nAlso, I grew up reading The Autobiography of Malcolm X and staring at the book version of Roots (seriously, that shit looks like it has all the pages) but watching the movie. Just saying, are white families making their kids read about Malcolm? I\u2019m better off for it.\n\n7. I went to typical long-service black churches as a youth.\n\nI currently attend a church\u2014when I\u2019m there\u2014that lasts about an hour, hour and a half tops. I appreciate this with all of the appreciation I can muster because I grew up going to church services that could last two-and-a-half hours, easy. And don\u2019t get me started on Easter. New suits are awesome, but sitting in there for a week waiting to get to another sermon about Jesus rising was not the business.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoing to that solidly Southern, super-long black-church service has me looking at come-as-you-are, hourlong services like a smaller version of the lottery. I went to a white service once in Alabama, and aside from the music being trash (not sure we can call it that, actually), the service was so short that I thought maybe we were cheating God by leaving after only an hour. I also recognize not all nonblack churches believe in brevity.\n\n8. I learned the significance of NOT giving left-hand dap.\n\nDisrespect is the leading cause of death for black males between the age of birth and death. I\u2019ve said this for the past 20 years and I cannot be convinced this isn\u2019t true. One thing white dudes don\u2019t seem to mind doing is extending that left hand. I\u2019ve actually seen with my own two eyes a fight nearly break out because one dude refused to accept a left-handed dap and the other fellow took offense at the implication that he was being disrespectful by offering it. Again, disrespect is a thing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. When somebody says \u201cIt\u2019s a black thing\u201d or \u201cThat\u2019s some white shit,\u201d I immediately understand what\u2019s happening.\n\nNo question is more annoying than \u201cWhat do you mean, it\u2019s a black thing? I don\u2019t understand.\u201d Especially coming from black people. You\u2019re just being contrarian or your parents REALLY tried to hide some shit from you. Mine didn\u2019t. I get it. And I always get it. And well, \u201cThat\u2019s some white shit\u201d is just one of those things that I believe growing up in a black household helped to crystallize, and largely covers the world of parenting, dancing, living, outdoor survival, near-death experiences for hobby or sport, and all other forms of noncolored active activities.\n\n10. I think being black is awesome and not some pathological condition that is full of negativity.\n\nI was raised to enjoy my blackness and believe that it didn\u2019t define me in any negative way. In fact, I believe that being black has only helped me out in life, whether through hard lessons and soft behinds or just by enjoying and appreciating seeing others succeed who know my life. Point is, growing up in my household helped me see pride, power and a bad-ass mudda who don\u2019t take no crap offa nobody.", "keywords": ["white", "dont", "im", "ive", "household", "reasons", "black", "know", "grew", "glad", "think", "raised", "shit", "music"], "polarity": 0.06031739351183798, "subjectivity": 0.4363167610852791},

I love wax prints (yes, I know they\u2019re actually Dutch/Indonesian), indigo mudcloth, Coptic crosses and Moroccan wedding blankets, and happen to be writing this while sitting under a red Bamil\u00e9k\u00e9 feather headdress gifted to me by a godmother who regularly visits the continent. I was born into that generation of children given African names by newly \u201cwoke\u201d parents (mine borrowed from the title of a Miles Davis song). And I may have rocked an African medallion in the early \u201990s, and head wraps well before Erykah Badu dropped her debut single.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s 2017, and I have no intention of attending a kinara-lighting ceremony looking like I\u2019m wearing a Kwanzaa costume. I\u2019m also not immune to the argument that there\u2019s a measure of appropriation in the way many of us approach wearing African fashion, as posited in 2015 by writer Zipporah Gene.\n\nWhile Gene\u2019s argument had a few holes, in an era in which African-inspired fashions and decor have reached peak popularity, it\u2019s well worth ongoing consideration and discussion of where the appreciation of our mother culture began and how to ensure it doesn\u2019t cross the appropriative line. As writer Nadra Nittle noted, in response to Gene\u2019s thesis:\n\nDonning dashikis, rejecting straightened hair, and taking on Afrocentric names directly originated from the \u201cblack is beautiful\u201d movement, which promoted black self-love. Embracing an African aesthetic during this period required courage, considering that in the recent past black students were discouraged from wearing bright colors, let alone African dress.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo is there a right way to pay reverence to the culture while rocking a current trend? Of course. To start, don\u2019t treat it like a trend. But in addition, I like to follow a few basic guidelines:\n\nShop From the Source\n\nDid you know you can buy Ankara-printed dresses on Amazon.com for under $50? Of course, you could also spend several hundreds more, and buy them from English designer and Beatle progeny Stella McCartney, who was taken to task this fall for using African prints (and a noticeable lack of African models) in her Spring 2018 collection.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNeedless to say, there are better ways to get the look while supporting designers of the African Diaspora: Think less Stella McCartney, more Stella Jean\u2014or Nigerian-born Duro Olowu. I personally love to support African designers by hitting African-owned Etsy and pop-up shops, like the many thrown by online marketplace Zuvaa this past year.\n\nA recent new find at one of these events? Benin-born designer Eldior Sodeck, whose Ankara-patterned silhouettes range from traditional to Afrofuturist, with nods to athleisure and Japanese kimonos.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t Mix and Max Out on Metaphors\n\nWith such a wealth of beautiful African goods out there, it\u2019s tempting to pile it all on\u2014but just because you can doesn\u2019t mean you should. You don\u2019t need to make a statement. African fashions are so striking, it\u2019s generally ideal to pick one item or category\u2014a bag or a blouse or an armful of bracelets (not all at once)\u2014and let that speak for itself. Besides, Africa is an entire continent, which means that putting too many elements together can actually be culturally confusing.\n\nCome Culturally Correct\n\nSince Kwanzaa is an African-American holiday, it\u2019s only fair to remind you that there are plenty of African-American designers doing the damn thing\u2014and evoking African styles and silhouettes in the process. Not sure where to start? Check out Demestik by Reuben Reuel or Onion Cut & Sewn by Whitney Mero. Feeling creative? Brooklyn, N.Y.-based home-design brand AphroChic sells its culturally evocative patterns by the yard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKnow Your History\n\nDo you know where the Ankara print originated, and how it evolved? How about the centuries of religious history behind the Coptic cross? Have you ever unraveled the complicated history of head wraps?\n\nThe fact is, there\u2019s a wealth of information out there to inform and support your style choices (ask Google\u2014she knows everything). Just having some basic knowledge can transform trend chasing into a teachable moment. For instance, if you\u2019re still conflicted about appropriation, Nadra Nittle also gifted us with this little bit of historical reference, which is handy for both Kwanzaa and the greater civil conflict in which we still find ourselves:\n\nAmerican blacks saw a parallel between Africa\u2019s struggle for independence and their own struggle for equal rights in the United States. Their interest in African fashion never stemmed from a desire to rip off African peoples and popularize their customs for profit, as is often the case with cultural appropriation. It stemmed from the desire to carve out a new racial identity in a nation that had not only treated them as sub-humans, but also taught them to buy into damaging stereotypes about their ancestral homeland, further instilling in them a sense of inferiority.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Liberian-born designer Abios\u00e9 Decont\u00e9e Massaquoi of Fiend List, the feeling is entirely mutual.\n\n\u201cYou know, I came from Liberia when I was young, and I came to America. And as an immigrant, coming from where I came from, I can appreciate what America [has] done for me,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd so, when I advertise my stuff ... I always, I always try to do it in a way where everybody can wear it, and enjoy it; kind of as a way of getting people together.\u201d\n\nIf that\u2019s not appreciation, I don\u2019t know what is.", "keywords": ["trend", "right", "style", "kwanzaa", "wearing", "argument", "black", "fashion", "appropriationvsappreciation", "ankhs", "african", "ongoing", "know", "way", "love", "ankara", "stella", "rock"], "polarity": 0.1284000721500721, "subjectivity": 0.39345306024993526},

A firebombing at the Everses\u2019 home in Jackson, Miss., forced Medgar and Myrlie to subject their young children to duck-and-cover drills in case of future terror attacks.\n\n\u201cI often wondered how Medgar could tolerate the anger and the hatred that was shown to him\u2014to his people, to all of us. How could he do it and not go off on some kind of rampage?\u201d Evers-Williams recalled in a recent interview. \u201cI told him I don\u2019t think I would be able to do it. He would just look at me and shake his head and say, \u2018Forget about yourself, it\u2019s larger than you. It\u2019s about all of us.\u201d\n\nThen, late on a Wednesday night in June 1963, a Klansman named Byron De La Beckwith hid in the bushes with a rifle and shot Medgar Evers in the back. It took three juries and more than 30 years to put Beckwith behind bars, where he died. After everything that her family endured, it\u2019s easy to understand why Evers-Williams, who grew up in Vicksburg, Miss., had difficulty trusting the state of Mississippi.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet, on Saturday, Evers-Williams will be seated alongside fellow civil rights veterans, political officials and other dignitaries to help cut the ribbon for the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum in Jackson. President Donald Trump, who was endorsed by Medgar Evers\u2019 brother, Charles, is also scheduled to attend the ceremony. This, despite Trump\u2019s own rocky relationship with African Americans, including failing to condemn white nationalists and criticizing black pro athletes for protesting police brutality.\n\nThe grand opening of the nation\u2019s first state-run civil rights museum coincides with the opening of the adjacent Museum of Mississippi History as well as the state\u2019s bicentennial.\n\nThe opening of the two facilities, which together cost upward of $90 million to construct, comes after a series of early controversies about the Civil Rights Museum\u2019s location and the decision to build two museums\u2014quietly derided in some circles as separate but equal buildings, a reference to the prevailing dictum of Jim Crow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, Mississippi is embroiled in debate over whether to remove a Confederate battle emblem from its official state flag, the last one in the country to incorporate the Southern cross.\n\nGiven the state\u2019s racial history and unwillingness to let go of vestiges of the Confederacy, the opening also has raised questions about whether a state-government-run museum will tell the whole, ugly truth about the civil rights era.\n\nThese are questions that Pamela Junior, the executive director of the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum, gets regularly. Junior says that as long as she\u2019s in charge, the museum will tell \u201cthe good, the bad and all of the ugly.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for the rationale for the two museums, Junior, who was not involved in the early planning of the museum, said the History Museum attempts to cover 50,000 years, only 30 of which include the civil rights movement. By contrast, the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum devotes an entire high-tech facility, complete with exhibits, artifacts, films, meeting space and future programming, to the time period spanning 1619\u2014when the first enslaved Africans arrived at a Jamestown, Va., colony\u2014to 1965 and beyond.\n\n\u201cWe were ground zero for the movement. Why should people go to Memphis [Tenn.] when we were here?\u201d says Junior, referring to the National Civil Rights Museum, housed three hours away at the Lorraine Motel, where Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated (the National Civil Rights Museum is run by a private foundation, not the state of Tennessee). \u201cWe\u2019re telling the truth. It\u2019s not a wonderful story. It\u2019s beautiful. Then again, it is in darkness that we finally see light. A lot of people went into the tunnel in the state of Mississippi in order to bring light to Mississippi.\u201d\n\nThe museum consists of eight galleries that cover almost 350 years of African-American history in Mississippi, starting with slavery and going through Reconstruction and Jim Crow\u2019s early days; four steel pillars carry the names of people who were lynched.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSmall theaters, with trigger warnings posted out front, highlight pivotal moments in the movement, including the stories of three civil rights workers who were killed near Philadelphia, Miss.; Medgar Evers; and Emmett Till, whose case is the subject of a short film narrated by Mississippi native Oprah Winfrey.\n\nThe front doors from the Bryant Grocery and Meat Market in Money, Miss., in which Emmett walked through for the last time in the summer of 1955, are on display.\n\nDeborah Watts, a Till cousin who grew up in Nebraska, was a toddler when Emmett was kidnapped, beaten and murdered after a white woman named Carolyn Bryant said the boy flirted with her and, in the aftermath of his death, his mangled face appeared in Jet magazine. Earlier this year, news reports emerged that Bryant, who is still alive, fabricated parts of her story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe Lynching of Emmett Till\u201d exhibit at the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum (courtesy of Mississippi Civil Rights Museum) \u201cNAACP\u2019s Man in the Field\u201d exhibit (courtesy of Mississippi Civil Rights Museum)\n\n\u201cSeparate Is Not Always Equal,\u201d exhibit view 1 (courtesy of Mississippi Civil Rights Museum) \u201cSeparate Is Not Always Equal,\u201d exhibit view 2 (courtesy of Mississippi Civil Rights Museum) \u201cSeparate Is Not Always Equal,\u201d exhibit view 3 (courtesy of Mississippi Civil Rights Museum) Gallery entryway (courtesy of Mississippi Civil Rights Museum)\n\nRear view of re-created church (courtesy of Mississippi Civil Rights Museum) \u201cIs This America?\u201d exhibit (courtesy of Mississippi Civil Rights Museum)\n\nWide-angle view of gallery 7 of Black Empowerment Gallery (courtesy of Mississippi Civil Rights Museum) Vernon Dahmer exhibit 1 in the Black Empowerment Gallery (courtesy of Mississippi Civil Rights Museum) Vernon Dahmer exhibit 2 in the Black Empowerment Gallery (courtesy of Mississippi Civil Rights Museum) This Little Light of Mine sculpture (courtesy of Mississippi Civil Rights Museum) This Little Light of Mine sculpture (courtesy of Mississippi Civil Rights Museum) This Little Light of Mine sculpture (courtesy of Mississippi Civil Rights Museum) 1 / 14\n\nWatts remembers that there was such a heavy mourning when Emmett\u2019s mother, Mamie Till-Mobley, visited Omaha to give a speech, Watts ripped up flyers that were being distributed about the incident; in her child\u2019s mind, the flyers were the cause of the sadness. Watts, who now lives in the Minneapolis area and founded the Emmett Till Legacy Foundation, said that Mississippi went from a place she avoided to some place to which she felt drawn, adding that the Civil Rights Museum represents a new day.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a greater sense of determination and responsibility to Emmett and those others whose blood was shed there and how important it was for justice to prevail,\u201d Watts said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn keeping with the theme of telling ugly-but-whole truths, the .30-06 Enfield rifle Beckwith used to kill Medgar Evers will be on display in one of the theaters; during a film on the Evers story, special lights will illuminate the gun.\n\nHis widow, Evers-Williams, says she is surprised that the rifle was ever recovered, much less ended up in a museum. Yet she is grateful the gun will be on display to send a message that weapons can be used for good but that Beckwith\u2019s rifle was used for \u201cpure evil.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cPeople will see it as a weapon that was used to take his life, but also, perhaps, as a weapon that was used\u2014unlike the person who pulled the trigger intended\u2014to lift Medgar up in a way that we understand who he was, how he felt about his state of Mississippi, his people, people as a whole, and how he felt about his country,\u201d Evers-Williams said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Evers-Williams, learning to entrust the state of Mississippi with Medgar\u2019s legacy took some soul-searching. She hopes that the Mississippi museums can be a major force in helping us be what we can be as a nation.\n\n\u201cI am human. I am still angry. I have been able to remove myself from the deep hatred that I felt when my husband was shot down at his door and our children ran out crying, \u2018Daddy, get up! Get up, Daddy.\u2019 But he said don\u2019t hate; work to alleviate it. And with these two museums, I hope there will be people internationally who will learn about Medgar and so many others who stood for justice and equality in this country,\u201d she said.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: The Mississippi Civil Rights Museum and the Museum of Mississippi History open to the public on Saturday.

What did she do? She doubled and tripled down on it. She went so far as to change her name to Nkechi Diallo, while some of you are running around with names like Ashley and Donald. I ... I don\u2019t even know what else to say. Except for never go Eric Ben\u00e9t. You see what I did there? Probably not. Let\u2019s move on.\n\nI don\u2019t know if Rachel\u2014her mama named her Rachel, I\u2019m gon\u2019 call her Rachel\u2014is broke, practicing for the Trollympics or just plain ol\u2019 bored and bought a nice new starter DSLR camera and a quote book, but she has decided to offer herself up as tribute to the comedy gods by putting together and dropping a calendar for 2018 featuring provocative (and slightly awkward) photos of herself and quotes like \u201cStay woke & change the world. You never know when an important opportunity will arise.\u201d I can see you all rushing to RachelDolezal.com right now to buy your own copy. Kidding! Why so serious?!\n\n(Also, the \u201cShop\u201d on her website includes items for sale that you\u2019d find at that local store in your mall that also sells black-Greek-letter-organization paraphernalia and those bad black paintings that everybody\u2019s grandma has a few prints of; it includes \u201cGimme Some Sugar Lollipops,\u201d \u201cMelanin Spectrum Dolls\u201d and \u201cShine On Soy Candles.\u201d)\n\nNow, my first instinct is to point and laugh with pure amusement at the traveshamockery that is this woman\u2019s bag since we all came to know of her existence a few years ago. Who in their right mind would make such a purchase, and for why? Does she have actual fans? Is anybody jackin\u2019 their jollies to Rachel Dolezal and just needed 12 months of pictures to do so? Like, what\u2019s a good reason for any single soul to make this $18.99 purchase?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTurns out, I can think of 10 reasons to buy this calendar as part of your Chrimmuh shopping.\n\n1. It\u2019s an amazing conversation starter.\n\nImagine having this calendar hanging up in your home, office or brothel. Who isn\u2019t going to say something about it? Either folks know who she is and will wonder why you have it, or not know who she is and wonder why you have this mediocre white woman with locs performing bad implied lust with nonsensical quotes attached.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe calendar, or at least the samples she made available, is reminiscent of people I hate most on Instagram who take thirst-trap pictures of themselves in thongs and pasties, then attach some fake-deep inspirational caption telling you to be your best self and love Jesus.\n\n2. It could be a conversation starter ... that\u2019s also a doorstop.\n\nHear me out. On Amazon.com, doorstops range from $3.95 to $24.95, but I mean, those are the ones you expect to see. What if you put this under a door and somebody comes in and sees it? Of course, they\u2019re going to look down and say, \u201cBruh, is that motherfucking Rachel Dolezal on your floor keeping the door open?\u201d Just saying. Think about it. It\u2019s probably meta or something.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. If you\u2019ve got a thing for white women, this kills two birds with one stone.\n\nHey, black man, you get to buy a calendar of a white woman, but she has locs and swears that she\u2019s a black woman on the inside. And again, her name is Nkechi now, legally. Sure, you love you some white women, but you get to act like you managed to find the blackest one out there. She\u2019s even a playable card in the race-centric game Trading Races, where the goal is to debate the blackest person in the deck. That\u2019s a win-win.\n\n4. It\u2019s a great gag gift.\n\nWho wouldn\u2019t laugh and grant the room an elongated \u201cNiggaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\u201d upon receiving this gift?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. At $18.99 it might make the best Secret Santa or White Elephant gift of all time ... as long as nobody has to divulge what came from whom.\n\nHow annoyed would you be if you pulled this gift? On the flip side, if you work in a white office, it might be hilarious and telling to see how folks respond to this calendar.\n\n6. It\u2019s also a perfect petty gift. I believe in petty.\n\nYour sister has been acting better than other people? Cool. Catch this December Dolezal, b. Your cousin claims nobody ever gets him anything even though he\u2019s been getting everything he ever wanted from Grandma since he was born? Cool. Catch this January Dolezal, LeDerrick-Joseph.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. If you want to support the self-identity-over-everything movement, here\u2019s your chance.\n\nBuying this calendar can prove just how committed you are to living your truest self and not letting society or anybody else tell you who you are, Moana. No one goes beyond the reef? Rachel Dolezal goes beyond the reef.\n\n8. Because maybe you don\u2019t actually find her that problematic.\n\nThere are some folks who actually don\u2019t have a problem with her or her antics. They don\u2019t view them as antics at all, in fact, but as a woman living her truth. Well, this is how you can show your real support for her. Nothing says \u201cI support this motherfucker\u201d like paying for a whole-ass calendar of that person.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. The calendar is filled with birthdays and black-history facts.\n\nIf nothing else, you have to appreciate her dedication to this plight and life of hers. This calendar adds to that, since I doubt there are any white-history alternative facts in it. If you\u2019re one of those people who are like, \u201cI have to respect her dedication,\u201d then here\u2019s a perfect item for you!\n\n10. It can be turned into a family bonding experience.\n\nYou, as a family, can split the $18.99 (plus HOLY SHIT, SHIPPING IS $10) and pass the Dolezal calendar around the family as a running gag for the whole year. I don\u2019t know how much bonding it creates, but at the very least, the jokes will fly on the first of each month, and what\u2019s better than one billionaire? Two. Especially if they come from the same hue as you. Sorry, I didn\u2019t think anybody was still reading this far.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDonotbuythisthingwhat\u2019swrongwithyou.", "keywords": ["white", "rachel", "thats", "dont", "real", "great", "dolezals", "buy", "woman", "reasons", "support", "know", "think", "2018", "thing", "dolezal", "gift", "calendar"], "polarity": 0.10608969441247923, "subjectivity": 0.5125093155789359},

Franklin, who directly confronted America\u2019s racist history and helped shaped the discourse around America\u2019s legacy of slavery. The stretch of road was dedicated to the influential scholar Monday afternoon at the Hayti Heritage Center.\n\n\n\nAs the Raleigh News and Observer notes, Franklin\u2019s name on a Southern roadway, which will now be called Dr. John H. Franklin Highway, is significant, particularly in North Carolina. It wasn\u2019t that long ago when visitors and residents entering the Tar Heel State were confronted with a welcome sign from the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClick here to view this www.newsobserver.com embed.\n\nFranklin, who died in 2009, was described by fellow historian Nell Irvin Painter as \u201cthe first great American historian to reckon the price [America] owed in violence, autocracy and militarism.\u201d\n\nFranklin meticulously documented African-American history. In 1947 he published From Slavery to Freedom: A History of African-Americans, described in his New York Times obituary as \u201cone of the definitive historical surveys of the American black experience\u201d and by Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert W. Fogel as \u201ca landmark in the interpretation of American civilization.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe former Duke University professor was among the first American scholars to confront the hypocrisy of America\u2019s ideals against its history of white supremacy. In one of his final works, a 2007 article for the Atlantic Monthly, Franklin wrote that \u201cif the American idea was to fight every war from the beginning of colonization to the middle of the 20th century with Jim Crow armed forces, in the belief that this would promote the American idea of justice and equality, then the American idea was an unmitigated disaster and a denial of the very principles that this country claimed as its rightful heritage.\u201d\n\nAs the Times wrote, Franklin earned many \u201cfirsts\u201d throughout his storied career. He was the first black president of the American Historical Association and the first black person to present a paper at the Southern Historical Association, which was segregated at the time (the group later elected him as its president). He was also the first black professor to serve as department chair in a majority-white institution (Brooklyn College).\n\nFranklin also applied his gifts as a scholar to the fight for civil rights, working on Thurgood Marshall\u2019s legal team in the Brown v. Board of Education case, the landmark Supreme Court case that struck down \u201cseparate but equal\u201d schooling in 1954. For his contributions, Franklin received the nation\u2019s highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, from Bill Clinton in 1995.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFranklin was originally from Oklahoma, but North Carolina became his adopted home state.\n\n\u201cDurham and the entire state of North Carolina were blessed to become his home,\u201d North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said of Franklin. \u201cHe wielded history as a tool.\u201d\n\n\n\nRead more at the Raleigh News and Observer.", "keywords": ["carolina", "advocate", "americas", "historian", "names", "black", "civil", "american", "franklin", "history", "historical", "idea", "groundbreaking", "rights", "highway", "north"], "polarity": 0.09269872639437858, "subjectivity": 0.2708717610891524},

Like other obscenely wealthy Russians, Agalarov has done business with the Trump family\u2014in this case, both the elder and younger Agalarov were instrumental in bringing the 2013 Miss Universe pageant to Moscow.

Went nowhere but had to listen.\u201d\n\nWhite House counselor Kellyanne Conway has been doing a bang-up job of looking really uncomfortable and changing the subject on television talk shows.

Vanessa has had to rely on her mother for financial help for her personal needs.\u201d\n\nHowever, a spokesperson for Vanessa told the gossip column: \u201cAll of these claims are simply not true. Don and Vanessa have tremendous respect for each other and always have. The notion that she has had to rely on her family for assistance is absolutely false and utterly ridiculous.\u201d\n\n\n\nSources noted that the couple\u2019s marriage was on the rocks long before they filed divorce papers in March. According to one woman who spoke with Page Six, the couple was having \u201crelationship problems before they married in 2005. Plus, his father\u2019s presidency has further exacerbated their issues.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey were having problems before they even got married. People were telling her not to marry him before the wedding,\u201d the source said. \u201cShe was interviewing divorce lawyers before [Donald Trump\u2019s presidency]. No one thought he\u2019d win. He won, and she decided to stay until his term is over. But she just couldn\u2019t stand it anymore.\u201d\n\nVanessa never vowed to stay with Trump Jr. while his dad was in office, according to her spokesperson. I think that\u2019s kind of clear, considering that she\u2019s filed for divorce.\n\nBut Page Six sources weren\u2019t through; they also added that Vanessa hates when \u201che posts stuff online, pictures of their kids and how he paints the picture of him as a perfect father, like he\u2019s Mr. Dad. It\u2019s not the truth. And when he\u2019s not away on business trips, he\u2019s hunting and fishing.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI bet you can\u2019t guess what Vanessa\u2019s rep had to say about this? Wrong; she denied it.\n\n\u201cVanessa is very protective of her five children as anyone would be, especially those in the public eye. That said, any claims that she is unhappy with Don posting photos of their children on social is not true. In fact, Vanessa is usually the first to \u2018like\u2019 the posts that he shares. Don is a wonderful and very involved father.\u201d\n\nTwo things we\u2019ve learned from this article is that we should all find a friend like Vanessa\u2019s spokesperson, and Trump Jr. is so cheap, he keeps the heat on 47, reuses birthday candles and gets his hair cut at a beauty college.", "keywords": ["vanessa", "sandals", "spokesperson", "hes", "report", "leaving", "told", "wife", "pair", "posts", "trump", "jrs", "jr", "plastic", "don", "donald", "cheap", "page"], "polarity": 0.07457049733212524, "subjectivity": 0.5306428068055974},

He successfully protested to desegregate Philadelphia\u2019s trolleys, he fought to pass constitutional amendments enfranchising black citizens, and then he worked to bring those new black voters to the polls.\ufeff\n\nCatto was assassinated in 1871\u2014only six years after the Civil War ended\u2014when gangs of armed white Philadelphians took to the streets to prevent black people from voting. That year\u2019s was the first election in which the city\u2019s black men could participate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Philadelphia magazine, Catto was shot twice in the back by a white man after sending teachers and students at his school home early that day, lest they encounter any violence. He was 32.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon in Philadelphia, 146 years after he was gunned down two doors away from his house, a monument to Catto will be unveiled at City Hall.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Philly.com reports, Catto\u2019s likeness will be the first public monument to honor a specific black American on the city\u2019s public landscape, and the first statue to go up at City Hall in nearly a century.\n\nCatto\u2019s statue is officially titled A Quest for Parity and is the work of Branley Cadet, a black artist based out of California.\n\nCadet recognizes that the site on which the monument will be erected was \u201ctransformed\u201d by Catto\u2019s work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey fought to desegregate the trolley cars,\u201d Cadet told Philly.com about the civil rights leader and his contemporaries. \u201cThey fought to ratify the 15th Amendment. So the world I live in is very different from the world Octavius Catto lived in.\u201d\n\n\n\nPhiladelphia Mayor Jim Kenney acknowledges that the lack of knowledge about black historical figures isn\u2019t accidental.\n\n\u201cI think Malcolm X was right when he was quoted as saying, I\u2019m paraphrasing, that the deeds of black people in this country have been systematically removed, the pages have been ripped out of the history books on purpose,\u201d Kenney told Philly.com, adding that respect between different groups isn\u2019t possible without first respecting everybody\u2019s efforts to improve American society.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t know \u2026 about the African-American contribution to Philadelphia or the United States, then you can\u2019t mutually appreciate how everybody contributed,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nRead more at philly.com.", "keywords": ["phillycom", "philadelphia", "pay", "hero", "black", "civil", "city", "american", "monument", "desegregate", "fought", "tribute", "forgotten", "rights", "catto"], "polarity": 0.07960431381484015, "subjectivity": 0.3706981468823574},

OK\u2014given the price tag, it was a big \u201cI love me\u201d present, but I budget at cost-per-wear, so there\u2019s that (that\u2019s another post, for later).\n\nAnyway, I fell in love at first sight with a wool boucle collarless cocoon coat in a gorgeous burnished marigold shade from the Olsen twins\u2019 fashion line Elizabeth and James (a low-key favorite label) and have been rocking it all winter long. Not only has it brought a bright touch to otherwise gray days\u2014I also get compliments on it everywhere I go. Like, people literally stop me in the street to remark on the color, y\u2019all. Every. Single. Day.\n\nSo it was no big surprise to me when folks started calling marigold one of the colors of 2018. It\u2019s long been a personal fave of mine, evoking exotic spices, hazy summer days and just all-around saturated goodness. But imagine my delight when I discovered that Grown-ish star and perennial fave Yara Shahidi and I\u2014albeit separated by a couple of letters, generation-wise\u2014share the same great taste in outerwear (that\u2019s my coat, y\u2019all!).\n\nBut what I loved most about Yara\u2019s ensemble is that she didn\u2019t just stop at one shade of yellow; she gave us a full monochromatic spectrum, from daffodil to mustard (believe it or not, she\u2019s also wearing yellow kicks). And as one who can personally attest to yellow being my very first favorite color (seriously\u2014before I could pronounce it properly, I called it \u201clellow\u201d), it got me inspired to incorporate more sunshine shades into my wardrobe this spring and summer when my beloved wool topper is relegated to the closet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut who are we kidding? Spring starts tomorrow, so now is the time! My colleague Corey Townsend often says, \u201cBlack women invented the color yellow\u201d; I\u2019d say that if it wasn\u2019t invented by us, it was, at the very least, invented for us. I mean, who else pulls off yellow\u2014all shades\u2014better than brown-skinned ladies?\n\nScreenshot: YouTube\n\nAnd yes, I do mean all shades of brown-skinned ladies; I promise there\u2019s a yellow just right for you. Hint: Lighter-skinned ladies tend to look better in saturated hues and orange- or green-tinted yellows like saffron and olive than buttery shades. But the more melanin, the more options\u2014which is why Viola Davis, Lupita Nyong\u2019o and Danai Gurira look amazing in any color they wear.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut if you\u2019re still hesitant to consider yellow a go-to when it comes to your sartorial choices, we\u2019ve provided a little celebrity inspiration to get you going. Yellow will be at all your fast-fashion retailers this spring; maybe it\u2019s time to reconsider what this hue can do for you!", "keywords": ["sunshine", "spring", "images", "yellow", "shades", "invented", "hello", "love", "color", "tis", "winter", "wool", "serve", "season", "getty"], "polarity": 0.20554684309401292, "subjectivity": 0.4315951972555746},

Hmmm...\n\nOf course, this wouldn\u2019t be entirely new territory for the producer, composer and erstwhile crooner-rapper; his collaboration with Adidas Originals has been going strong for years now, albeit running into some controversial territory with his latest collection, inspired by the color-saturated Indian celebration Holi.

Many. Hats.\n\nI mean, hats are kind of Pharrell\u2019s ministry, no? And while the \u00fcber-producer is well-known for creating bangers (and we may or may not still be banging N.E.R.D.\u2019s first album), like his contemporary, Kanye, his fashion choices have sometimes left us feeling ... challenged, to say the least.

Forgive the lazy pun, but the word is that the first of the Ball(er)s to make it to the league and put out a shoe is making enough money to look smart for spurning potential shoe deals from Nike, Adidas, etc. According to the co-owners of the agency handling marketing and fulfillment (I really hope they\u2019re fulfilled on the inside as well as the outside), Big Baller Brand\u2019s ZO2 basketball shoes basically move rhymes like weight.\n\nFrom USA Today:\n\nIn the latest episode of \u201cDeeClassified,\u201d Dee Murthy, who co-founded FiveFour Club and Young & Reckless, sat down with Chris Ngo and Lee Ramirez, the co-owners of the Leverage Showroom agency, who partnered with Zo and LaVar Ball to handle marketing and fulfillment for the Triple Bs\u2019 ZO2 Collection. During their chat, the participants touched on the terms that the Crown Prince of Chino Hills turned down in order to support his family business. Ngo pegged the potential value of Lonzo\u2019s offers from the established apparel companies at $2-4 million per year. That falls right in line with previous estimates from ESPN\u2019s Nick DePaula, who suggested that Ball left as much as $15 million over five years on the table to be the face of the Big Baller Brand. According to Ngo, who wants to help make the Big Baller Brand \u201cthe new And1,\u201d Lonzo has \u201cmade more than that already with Big Baller Brand.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the ancient words of Ice-T, \u201cGet your money, man.\u201d\n\nNow, I have to admit: I have no idea who is buying Big Baller Brand clothing. I love purchasing and rocking black-business apparel. My closet is full of clothing items from folks in Washington, D.C. (I love shopping locally) who have started their own lines. And none of that stuff is ever cheap.\n\nAt the same time, LaVar Ball managed to turn me off of BBB entirely, and that $495 price tag for a pair of shoes had me like, #NawBruh, even though I absolutely have more than one pair of shoes that cost more than that. I don\u2019t particularly like the ZO2s, either, but that wasn\u2019t my main reason for not copping. Luckily, they don\u2019t need me to fill out their bottom line since they\u2019re out here winning and Lonzo \u2019nem are getting it how they live.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo date, I\u2019ve only seen one person ever in life wearing a Big Baller Brand hoodie, and that was at the Atlanta airport\u2014they could have been Ball cousins. Obviously, people have purchased the apparel, and somebody had to order the shoes; I\u2019ve watched a few videos on YouTube of folks unboxing them. And considering their public profile\u2014patriarch LaVar Ball actually got into it with an actual sitting U.S. president\u2014it\u2019s entirely possible that whole communities in places I\u2019ve never been to are walking around geared up on that newest BBB \u2019nalia. If this happened in Iowa or in communities who shoot for proximity to blackness without actual blackness, I would not be surprised. But I really wonder who is doing all of the copping.\n\nIf I think about it, there is one community that I\u2019m entirely sure would be purchasing and wearing BBB clothing. These folks basically just need to know two things: 1) They\u2019re black owned, and 2) where to get it. These are the folks like my father who are actually rooting for everybody black\u2014the same folks who would have voted for Obama no matter what happened short of seeing him snorting a line of cocaine off the ass of a white woman, and even then\u2014if he didn\u2019t shout out his social security number\u2014might still grant him benefit of the doubt.\n\n\n\nOlder black folks are ALWAYS rooting for everybody black. They weren\u2019t voting for anybody BUT Obama, and they keep Tyler Perry in business because he\u2019s black. I remember once I needed to get the airport to fly back to D.C. one Sunday many moons ago. And do you know neither of my parents volunteered to take me? They live in Madison, Ala., a suburb of Huntsville, and there aren\u2019t exactly cabs anywhere, and this was before Uber, which I\u2019m also not sure is even there now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy didn\u2019t they want to take me? Because Tiger Woods was playing. Or Venus or Serena was playing. At this point I honestly don\u2019t remember, but watching black people beat white people at shit is what they live for. If there were a world-champion pingpong player from Detroit making it to television on Sunday afternoons, that\u2019s where they\u2019d be, their son\u2019s need to get home be damned.\n\nIn fact, I\u2019m surprised my father doesn\u2019t have anything from BBB right now, and I\u2019m really only guessing that he doesn\u2019t since you have to order it online and he\u2019d much rather walk into a store and walk out with something in hand than order it and wait. My father is an impatient man when it comes to his support of your blackness. But I\u2019m pretty positive that he\u2019s like so many other folks in our community who are actively supporting any and every cause as long as you tell them it\u2019s black and isn\u2019t anti-Jesus.\n\nOnce you add that to people who will support JUST because it exists, sneakerheads who believe the shoes are an investment of sorts and relationships built with schools or organizations and little white kids who like having that cool new black shit because their parents don\u2019t spend enough time with them and try to make up for it with money, the Balls are ballin\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo maybe LaVar and Lonzo were right in spurning those deals from the bigger companies. Doing it their way seems to be working for Lonzo, at least; how LiAngelo and LaMelo fare is yet to be seen. But there\u2019s more than one way to skin a cat, apparently.\n\nAnd apparently, WAY more of you all have BBB clothing than social media indicates.", "keywords": ["im", "baller", "bbb", "order", "folks", "black", "big", "exactly", "buying", "brand", "ball", "shoes", "lonzo", "products"], "polarity": 0.1099376217094664, "subjectivity": 0.44297832695890943},

Kennedy Library and Museum in Boston held a special exhibit celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Jacqueline Bouvier and John F. Kennedy nuptials. Visitors got to see various mementos from the 1953 wedding, considered the social event of the season at the time. A highlight of the exhibit was Bouvier\u2019s ivory silk-taffeta bridal dress, which received a lot of media attention for its exquisite design. It also sparked renewed interest in the woman who made it: Ann Lowe, a little-known African-American designer who specialized in formal wear for wealthy socialites.\n\n\n\nPhoto: AP Images\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI first learned about Ann Lowe years ago when I went up to what was then the Black Fashion Museum in Harlem,\u201d recalls Valerie Steele, fashion historian and director of the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City, where several of Lowe\u2019s dresses are housed. \u201cWhat struck me was that she was a custom dressmaker to elite, white society, which was a significant genre,\u201d says Steele.\n\n\n\n\u201cI love my clothes and I\u2019m particular about who wears them,\u201d Lowe famously told Ebony magazine. \u201cI am not interested in sewing for caf\u00e9 society or social climbers. I do not cater to Mary and Sue. I sew for families of the Social Register.\u201d The story of how she became one of their most sought-after designers is quite remarkable.\n\nDelaware Public Media/YouTube\n\nBorn in 1898 in Clayton, Ala., Lowe came from a family of dressmakers. Her grandmother Georgia Cole made clothes for her plantation mistress before becoming a free woman in 1860, and her mother, Jane Lowe, was an expert seamstress and embroiderer. Learning from both women, Lowe became skilled at creating intricate fabric flower adornments that would later become one of her signatures. The women eventually moved to Montgomery, Ala., where they ran a successful dressmaking business. When her mother died suddenly while making gowns for the governor\u2019s wife and daughters, Lowe, then 16, completed the project and subsequently headed the family business.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA wealthy Floridian impressed with Lowe\u2019s skills invited her to move to Tampa and become her family\u2019s seamstress. As word of her talent spread, her clientele increased.\n\n\u201cThere have always been black women who were dressmakers,\u201d says Audrey Smaltz, former Ebony Fashion Fair commentator and founder of the Ground Crew backstage management company. \u201cIf they had a dressmaking job in a white lady\u2019s house and that lady was looking good, she would also subcontract the dressmaker out to others. That\u2019s how black women got to be seamstresses. They\u2019d work for one family and maybe that family would help her [become established].\u201d\n\nWith her employer\u2019s support and encouragement, Lowe enrolled at the S.T. Taylor School of Design in New York. She studied alone in a separate classroom because white students did not want to attend class with a \u201cNegro.\u201d Ironically, her designs were often upheld as examples in the same classes she was forbidden to attend, and she successfully completed her two-year design program in half the time. Lowe returned to Tampa, opened a shop, and hired 18 seamstresses to help her keep pace with requests for balls, cotillions and other formal affairs. Business was good, but Lowe was eager to fulfill her dream of working in New York City. Taking $20,000 in savings, she closed shop and headed north.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Great Depression hit soon after she arrived in the city. To make ends meet, she took work designing and sewing for prestige labels like A.F. Chantilly and Sonia Gowns. Those jobs were her introduction to New York society\u2014and its introduction to her\u2014though its members wouldn\u2019t immediately know it, because the labels on her creations bore the company\u2019s name.\n\n\n\nLowe\u2019s career really took off during the prosperous postwar years when wealthy women flocked to the opera, theater and galas and needed the appropriate attire. Debutante balls were growing in popularity as well, so there was a new generation of socialites to design for. \u201cThe girls were coming out in those days, and she was so good at making cotillion dresses,\u201d Smaltz says. \u201cShe had lots of upper-echelon clients\u201d\u2014du Ponts, Roosevelts, Rockefellers, Whitneys, Posts, Bouviers and Auchinclosses among them.\n\nLowe opened Ann Lowe\u2019s Gowns in Harlem in 1950, and Ann Lowe\u2019s Originals on Manhattan\u2019s Madison Avenue in 1968, making her the first African American to have a business on the high-end retail strip.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA 1966 Saturday Evening Post article called Lowe \u201cSociety\u2019s Best Kept Secret,\u201d a description that Steele says could be a double-edged sword. \u201cOn the one hand, people really liked her work. On the other hand, they weren\u2019t exactly boasting that this beautiful dress they had was made by an African-American designer,\u201d Steele says. \u201cThey probably would have been just as happy to have people think, \u2018Oh, maybe she\u2019s wearing Dior.\u2019 It didn\u2019t help her business that people weren\u2019t talking her up.\u201d\n\nAnother detriment to business was that Lowe, succumbing to pressure from clients, often sold dresses for much less than they were worth. Mounting business debts and back taxes forced her to declare bankruptcy and shutter her first store in the early 1960s. Thanks to an anonymous benefactor who paid off her debts, Lowe rebounded and continued to work at her Madison Avenue store until her retirement in 1972.\n\nThanks to some recent efforts, Lowe is having another fashion moment. An exhibit of her dresses at the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C., is exposing thousands of visitors to her legacy and artistry. Julia Faye Smith\u2019s 2016 biography, Something to Prove: A Biography of Ann Lowe, America\u2019s Forgotten Designer, filled with archival pictures, puts Lowe\u2019s life and career in historical context. And there is even a children\u2019s book, Fancy Party Gowns: The Story of Fashion Designer Ann Cole Lowe, by Deborah Blumenthal and Laura Freeman, which introduces little ones to this American great. May she never fall into obscurity again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFive Fab Facts About Ann Lowe", "keywords": ["lowe", "secret", "societys", "stylish", "ann", "gowns", "knew", "fashion", "designer", "women", "lowes", "york", "work", "museum", "force", "business"], "polarity": 0.24201031652330354, "subjectivity": 0.4269803789284308},

One of Suckabee\u2019s few jobs is to translate for the devil, who, for years, has been losing some of his pigment, and instead of being red is just Cheetos-dust-colored.\n\n\n\nSo it makes sense that Suckabee is out here doing the non-Lord\u2019s work.

Cool. You\u2019re trying to make friends with black people, but you\u2019ve never really made friends with black people. I mean, you\u2019ve known some black people throughout your life, but never enough to really call them \u201cfriends.\u201d\n\nBut these black people, they\u2019re different. You feel a kinship, a connection, a bond. You feel like you want to really get to know them, have them be a part of your life and truly open up to them.\n\nHow do you do it?\n\n\n\nHow do you cross the uncomfortable divide of race and culture and make a genuine connection with your new black friend (hopefully) without it getting weird?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWorry not, because we\u2019re here to help.

If you are black, you can print this out for your new white friends as a quick read to help cultivate your burgeoning friendship.\n\nI wonder if they know the other black person that I know; should I ask them?\n\nProbably not, for two reasons. The first being that it\u2019s a dead giveaway that you do not know many black people, if any, and that you have no idea just how many black people there are (hint: There are 47 million of us in America). Second, it\u2019s a weak way to start up a conversation, and it lets us know you assume that we don\u2019t have any other mutual interests beyond, well, beyond the fact that we both know some black people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSurprisingly, you\u2019ve got a lot more in common with the black folks around you than you think. We all eat food, we all got families and we all watch Game of Thrones (yo, black people love some Thrones, y\u2019all). So start there instead of dragging Sheila from accounts payable at your old job into this relationship.\n\n(Sidenote: We think we know Sheila, though. I mean, we probably do.

It\u2019s not cool.)\n\n\n\nShould I tell them about the black person I dated briefly in college?\n\nPlease don\u2019t.\n\nDo we have to talk about race all the time?\n\nIf it makes you uncomfortable, yes. Yes, we do, for that reason.\n\nDid you watch that O.J. Simpson 30 for 30 documentary?\n\nHell yeah! That shit was great. Man, there hasn\u2019t been an exploration into the intersections of race, class, celebrity and the fault lines of the criminal-justice system like that in the history of television.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI mean, white people who like The Wire get props in our book, but if you actually watched that O.J. doc and really and genuinely walked away from it with some informed understanding of how African Americans view the police and our historic relationship with law enforcement, then more power to you. That\u2019s worth a solid fist bump with a lower lip bite, homey.\n\nSee, THAT\u2019S how you let us know where you stand on things.

How do I talk about this with my new black friend?\n\nNah.\n\nDon\u2019t.\n\nYou\u2019re probably not ready for a black friend right now. Just back away from black people and deal with your own shit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo everyone who voted for Trump is a racist?\n\nIf you aren\u2019t, then you\u2019re OK with racism.

In fact, you should plan the meal in anticipation of some bomb-ass macaroni and work from there. If your new black friend makes shitty macaroni, chances are they don\u2019t have many black friends, either, and y\u2019all were never gonna work out anyway.\n\nThey\u2019ve invited me over to a barbecue. What should I bring?\n\nThis one\u2019s dicey because, in your mind, you\u2019re probably thinking that you should answer their call as if it\u2019s some kind of cultural exchange where you\u2019ll have some of their native dishes and you\u2019ll bring one of yours in kind.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t do that.\n\nWhen it comes to how the food is seasoned, prepared, cooked and presented, you gotta really have a thorough understanding of the black folks you\u2019re dealing with before you just start showing up with random shit. Is this a pork house or a nonpork house? Are they cool with coleslaw? Is this a Hennessy or a Remy family? Too many variables, man. Don\u2019t chance it. Besides, they\u2019re going to ask you to bring a nonperishable item to keep it simple for you, so chances are you\u2019re getting plates anyway.\n\n\n\nBut if you do start feeling inspired and want to make your Oma\u2019s special-recipe green-bean-and-wheat salad, stop. Don\u2019t bring that shit.

Just bring cups and napkins. Black folks love napkins. You can never go wrong with napkins \u2026 or ice, \u2019cause we know Marvin an\u2019nem always forget that shit.\n\nWhen do I get to use the n-word?\n\nNever. The answer is never. Not even if you stay friends for the next 55 years and find yourselves sitting next to each other in the home whilst Wu-Tang plays in the background of your bingo game. It\u2019s \u201cShame on a nuh\u201d for you forever.

Anybody who cops the \u201cI don\u2019t see race\u201d plea is immediately suspect to all black people. Saying that you don\u2019t see race is essentially admitting that you\u2019re so willing to deny your own biases that you\u2019ll revoke part of someone else\u2019s identity to make you feel better about your inadequacies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t believe me?

Forgive the lazy pun, but the word is that the first of the Ball(er)s to make it to the league and put out a shoe is making enough money to look smart for spurning potential shoe deals from Nike, Adidas, etc. According to the co-owners of the agency handling marketing and fulfillment (I really hope they\u2019re fulfilled on the inside as well as the outside), Big Baller Brand\u2019s ZO2 basketball shoes basically move rhymes like weight.\n\nFrom USA Today:\n\nIn the latest episode of \u201cDeeClassified,\u201d Dee Murthy, who co-founded FiveFour Club and Young & Reckless, sat down with Chris Ngo and Lee Ramirez, the co-owners of the Leverage Showroom agency, who partnered with Zo and LaVar Ball to handle marketing and fulfillment for the Triple Bs\u2019 ZO2 Collection. During their chat, the participants touched on the terms that the Crown Prince of Chino Hills turned down in order to support his family business. Ngo pegged the potential value of Lonzo\u2019s offers from the established apparel companies at $2-4 million per year. That falls right in line with previous estimates from ESPN\u2019s Nick DePaula, who suggested that Ball left as much as $15 million over five years on the table to be the face of the Big Baller Brand. According to Ngo, who wants to help make the Big Baller Brand \u201cthe new And1,\u201d Lonzo has \u201cmade more than that already with Big Baller Brand.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the ancient words of Ice-T, \u201cGet your money, man.\u201d\n\nNow, I have to admit: I have no idea who is buying Big Baller Brand clothing. I love purchasing and rocking black-business apparel. My closet is full of clothing items from folks in Washington, D.C. (I love shopping locally) who have started their own lines. And none of that stuff is ever cheap.\n\nAt the same time, LaVar Ball managed to turn me off of BBB entirely, and that $495 price tag for a pair of shoes had me like, #NawBruh, even though I absolutely have more than one pair of shoes that cost more than that. I don\u2019t particularly like the ZO2s, either, but that wasn\u2019t my main reason for not copping. Luckily, they don\u2019t need me to fill out their bottom line since they\u2019re out here winning and Lonzo \u2019nem are getting it how they live.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo date, I\u2019ve only seen one person ever in life wearing a Big Baller Brand hoodie, and that was at the Atlanta airport\u2014they could have been Ball cousins. Obviously, people have purchased the apparel, and somebody had to order the shoes; I\u2019ve watched a few videos on YouTube of folks unboxing them. And considering their public profile\u2014patriarch LaVar Ball actually got into it with an actual sitting U.S. president\u2014it\u2019s entirely possible that whole communities in places I\u2019ve never been to are walking around geared up on that newest BBB \u2019nalia. If this happened in Iowa or in communities who shoot for proximity to blackness without actual blackness, I would not be surprised. But I really wonder who is doing all of the copping.\n\nIf I think about it, there is one community that I\u2019m entirely sure would be purchasing and wearing BBB clothing. These folks basically just need to know two things: 1) They\u2019re black owned, and 2) where to get it. These are the folks like my father who are actually rooting for everybody black\u2014the same folks who would have voted for Obama no matter what happened short of seeing him snorting a line of cocaine off the ass of a white woman, and even then\u2014if he didn\u2019t shout out his social security number\u2014might still grant him benefit of the doubt.\n\n\n\nOlder black folks are ALWAYS rooting for everybody black. They weren\u2019t voting for anybody BUT Obama, and they keep Tyler Perry in business because he\u2019s black. I remember once I needed to get the airport to fly back to D.C. one Sunday many moons ago. And do you know neither of my parents volunteered to take me? They live in Madison, Ala., a suburb of Huntsville, and there aren\u2019t exactly cabs anywhere, and this was before Uber, which I\u2019m also not sure is even there now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy didn\u2019t they want to take me? Because Tiger Woods was playing. Or Venus or Serena was playing. At this point I honestly don\u2019t remember, but watching black people beat white people at shit is what they live for. If there were a world-champion pingpong player from Detroit making it to television on Sunday afternoons, that\u2019s where they\u2019d be, their son\u2019s need to get home be damned.\n\nIn fact, I\u2019m surprised my father doesn\u2019t have anything from BBB right now, and I\u2019m really only guessing that he doesn\u2019t since you have to order it online and he\u2019d much rather walk into a store and walk out with something in hand than order it and wait. My father is an impatient man when it comes to his support of your blackness. But I\u2019m pretty positive that he\u2019s like so many other folks in our community who are actively supporting any and every cause as long as you tell them it\u2019s black and isn\u2019t anti-Jesus.\n\nOnce you add that to people who will support JUST because it exists, sneakerheads who believe the shoes are an investment of sorts and relationships built with schools or organizations and little white kids who like having that cool new black shit because their parents don\u2019t spend enough time with them and try to make up for it with money, the Balls are ballin\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo maybe LaVar and Lonzo were right in spurning those deals from the bigger companies. Doing it their way seems to be working for Lonzo, at least; how LiAngelo and LaMelo fare is yet to be seen. But there\u2019s more than one way to skin a cat, apparently.\n\nAnd apparently, WAY more of you all have BBB clothing than social media indicates.", "keywords": ["im", "baller", "bbb", "order", "folks", "black", "big", "exactly", "buying", "brand", "ball", "shoes", "lonzo", "products"], "polarity": 0.1099376217094664, "subjectivity": 0.44297832695890943},

Savenok (Getty Images for New York & Company), Charley Gallay (Getty Images for Christian Siriano), Vittorio Zunino Celotto (Getty Images), Matt Winkelmeyer (Getty Images)\n\nLast Christmas, to fight the winter blahs and celebrate our first successful month at The Glow Up, I indulged in a little \u201cI love me\u201d present. OK\u2014given the price tag, it was a big \u201cI love me\u201d present, but I budget at cost-per-wear, so there\u2019s that (that\u2019s another post, for later).\n\nAnyway, I fell in love at first sight with a wool boucle collarless cocoon coat in a gorgeous burnished marigold shade from the Olsen twins\u2019 fashion line Elizabeth and James (a low-key favorite label) and have been rocking it all winter long. Not only has it brought a bright touch to otherwise gray days\u2014I also get compliments on it everywhere I go. Like, people literally stop me in the street to remark on the color, y\u2019all. Every. Single. Day.\n\nSo it was no big surprise to me when folks started calling marigold one of the colors of 2018. It\u2019s long been a personal fave of mine, evoking exotic spices, hazy summer days and just all-around saturated goodness. But imagine my delight when I discovered that Grown-ish star and perennial fave Yara Shahidi and I\u2014albeit separated by a couple of letters, generation-wise\u2014share the same great taste in outerwear (that\u2019s my coat, y\u2019all!).\n\nBut what I loved most about Yara\u2019s ensemble is that she didn\u2019t just stop at one shade of yellow; she gave us a full monochromatic spectrum, from daffodil to mustard (believe it or not, she\u2019s also wearing yellow kicks). And as one who can personally attest to yellow being my very first favorite color (seriously\u2014before I could pronounce it properly, I called it \u201clellow\u201d), it got me inspired to incorporate more sunshine shades into my wardrobe this spring and summer when my beloved wool topper is relegated to the closet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut who are we kidding? Spring starts tomorrow, so now is the time! My colleague Corey Townsend often says, \u201cBlack women invented the color yellow\u201d; I\u2019d say that if it wasn\u2019t invented by us, it was, at the very least, invented for us. I mean, who else pulls off yellow\u2014all shades\u2014better than brown-skinned ladies?\n\nScreenshot: YouTube\n\nAnd yes, I do mean all shades of brown-skinned ladies; I promise there\u2019s a yellow just right for you. Hint: Lighter-skinned ladies tend to look better in saturated hues and orange- or green-tinted yellows like saffron and olive than buttery shades. But the more melanin, the more options\u2014which is why Viola Davis, Lupita Nyong\u2019o and Danai Gurira look amazing in any color they wear.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut if you\u2019re still hesitant to consider yellow a go-to when it comes to your sartorial choices, we\u2019ve provided a little celebrity inspiration to get you going.

As Diddy rhymes in the remix to Wal\u00e9\u2019s song \u201cSlight Work\u201d: \u201cHow could you not admire me? Jocking my men entirely, chop the top off the drop and tell \u2019em Basquiat inspired me.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLikewise, in one of his many references to the painter, Jay-Z, who reportedly dropped $4.5 million on a single Basquiat canvas, let it flow on the song \u201cPicasso Baby\u201d: \u201cIt ain\u2019t hard to tell, I\u2019m the new Jean-Michel.\u201d\n\nBasquiat, who died in 1988 at the age of 27, illustrated what it meant to be a successful artist for his generation. Blessed with great talent, the artist lived out a strangely fairy-tale existence. Born a middle-class kid in Brooklyn, N.Y., he went from a loving home to living in a cardboard box in New York City\u2019s West Village, where he made his way to becoming an art-world darling in the roaring market of the 1980s, quickly recognized and handsomely rewarded by collectors, institutions and artists alike for his graffiti-inspired art dealing with themes of black identity and personal obsessions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBasquiat\u2019s works have sold for record-shattering prices, most recently in May 2017, when his work Untitled was bought at Christie\u2019s auction house by the richest man in Japan, billionaire Yusaku Maezawa, for a reported $110.5 million. To date, it is the highest price ever paid for a work by an American artist, a record previously held by Silver Car Crash (Double Disaster), by Basquiat\u2019s mentor, pop art icon artist Andy Warhol, which sold for $105.4 million in 2013.\n\nBut not all fairy tales have happy endings. Basquiat\u2019s golden-boy status and meteoric rise were chronicled in the 1996 film Basquiat, made by his friend, painter and Oscar-nominated director Julian Schnabel. It was the Hollywood version of how Basquiat magically lit up the art world, only to sadly flame out in ruins from a heroin overdose.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring his short life, Basquiat ran in the rock-star world of painters, with Warhol as his champion and mentor. Warhol reportedly never took a drink or drug\u2014and begged Basquiat to get clean, to no avail. The two even collaborated on paintings; Basquiat\u2014who went by the graffiti tag \u201cSAMO\u201d\u2014painted on top of Warhol\u2019s work. It was a version of sampling, marrying one side of pop culture to another.\n\nSean John (SeanJohn.com) Sean John (SeanJohn.com) Sean John (SeanJohn.com) Sean John (SeanJohn.com) 1 / 4\n\nWhat made Basquiat such a fascinating character to many was his uncanny ability to capture his own mysterious inner life, as well as the imaginations driving the market in the seemingly impenetrable art world. Kim Heirston, the black female owner and founder of Kim Heirston Art Advisory, explains Basquiat\u2019s enduring appeal: \u201cLike Leonardo da Vinci or Pablo Picasso, Basquiat inspires each and every one of us to tap into our own artistic genius .... and our own inner wild child.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBasquiat is admired as much for his in-your-face art, exploring ongoing themes of skeletons (symbolizing death); crowns (symbols of money, power and respect); and paint dripping and oozing like blood (a visual metaphor for passion and struggle), shot through with text from hip-hop music, where black men\u2019s real and raw speaking voices were being heard for the first time in pop culture.\n\nLike a true graffiti artist, Basquiat painted on canvases, plates, doors, notebook paper, even his girlfriend\u2019s dress, you name it\u2014he painted on whatever was at hand when inspiration seized him. Basquiat rose to the top of the art-world game crowned with natty dreads, open to using questions of his black identity as a way to call into question perceptions of race. He often called his art \u201cignorant art\u201d as an attention-grabbing marketing tactic, then turned around and fought the moniker of being called a \u201cblack painter\u201d as a qualifier.\n\nJean-Michel Basquiat: The Radiant Child, a documentary directed by his friend Tamra Davis, is a real and touching portrait of the artist as he most probably saw his own life and work:\n\nLuckily for us, we\u2019ve arrived at an era where important black painters are becoming the norm. Kehinde Wiley and Amy Sherald\u2019s portraits of Barack and Michelle Obama, respectively, hang in the National Gallery, and more are sure to come. There\u2019s also a long list of important black artists who paved the way for us to go and buy a Sean John x Basquiat T-shirt at Macy\u2019s, on sale this week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the collection, the jean jacket, adorned with a marauding T. rex with Basquiat\u2019s iconic gold crown floating above its head like a halo, is particularly poignant. The image is probably most famous from the children\u2019s book Life Doesn\u2019t Frighten Me, published five years after Basquiat\u2019s death in collaboration with poet laureate Maya Angelou.

Forgive the lazy pun, but the word is that the first of the Ball(er)s to make it to the league and put out a shoe is making enough money to look smart for spurning potential shoe deals from Nike, Adidas, etc. According to the co-owners of the agency handling marketing and fulfillment (I really hope they\u2019re fulfilled on the inside as well as the outside), Big Baller Brand\u2019s ZO2 basketball shoes basically move rhymes like weight.\n\nFrom USA Today:\n\nIn the latest episode of \u201cDeeClassified,\u201d Dee Murthy, who co-founded FiveFour Club and Young & Reckless, sat down with Chris Ngo and Lee Ramirez, the co-owners of the Leverage Showroom agency, who partnered with Zo and LaVar Ball to handle marketing and fulfillment for the Triple Bs\u2019 ZO2 Collection. During their chat, the participants touched on the terms that the Crown Prince of Chino Hills turned down in order to support his family business. Ngo pegged the potential value of Lonzo\u2019s offers from the established apparel companies at $2-4 million per year. That falls right in line with previous estimates from ESPN\u2019s Nick DePaula, who suggested that Ball left as much as $15 million over five years on the table to be the face of the Big Baller Brand. According to Ngo, who wants to help make the Big Baller Brand \u201cthe new And1,\u201d Lonzo has \u201cmade more than that already with Big Baller Brand.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the ancient words of Ice-T, \u201cGet your money, man.\u201d\n\nNow, I have to admit: I have no idea who is buying Big Baller Brand clothing. I love purchasing and rocking black-business apparel. My closet is full of clothing items from folks in Washington, D.C. (I love shopping locally) who have started their own lines. And none of that stuff is ever cheap.\n\nAt the same time, LaVar Ball managed to turn me off of BBB entirely, and that $495 price tag for a pair of shoes had me like, #NawBruh, even though I absolutely have more than one pair of shoes that cost more than that. I don\u2019t particularly like the ZO2s, either, but that wasn\u2019t my main reason for not copping. Luckily, they don\u2019t need me to fill out their bottom line since they\u2019re out here winning and Lonzo \u2019nem are getting it how they live.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo date, I\u2019ve only seen one person ever in life wearing a Big Baller Brand hoodie, and that was at the Atlanta airport\u2014they could have been Ball cousins. Obviously, people have purchased the apparel, and somebody had to order the shoes; I\u2019ve watched a few videos on YouTube of folks unboxing them. And considering their public profile\u2014patriarch LaVar Ball actually got into it with an actual sitting U.S. president\u2014it\u2019s entirely possible that whole communities in places I\u2019ve never been to are walking around geared up on that newest BBB \u2019nalia. If this happened in Iowa or in communities who shoot for proximity to blackness without actual blackness, I would not be surprised. But I really wonder who is doing all of the copping.\n\nIf I think about it, there is one community that I\u2019m entirely sure would be purchasing and wearing BBB clothing. These folks basically just need to know two things: 1) They\u2019re black owned, and 2) where to get it. These are the folks like my father who are actually rooting for everybody black\u2014the same folks who would have voted for Obama no matter what happened short of seeing him snorting a line of cocaine off the ass of a white woman, and even then\u2014if he didn\u2019t shout out his social security number\u2014might still grant him benefit of the doubt.\n\n\n\nOlder black folks are ALWAYS rooting for everybody black. They weren\u2019t voting for anybody BUT Obama, and they keep Tyler Perry in business because he\u2019s black. I remember once I needed to get the airport to fly back to D.C. one Sunday many moons ago. And do you know neither of my parents volunteered to take me? They live in Madison, Ala., a suburb of Huntsville, and there aren\u2019t exactly cabs anywhere, and this was before Uber, which I\u2019m also not sure is even there now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy didn\u2019t they want to take me? Because Tiger Woods was playing. Or Venus or Serena was playing. At this point I honestly don\u2019t remember, but watching black people beat white people at shit is what they live for. If there were a world-champion pingpong player from Detroit making it to television on Sunday afternoons, that\u2019s where they\u2019d be, their son\u2019s need to get home be damned.\n\nIn fact, I\u2019m surprised my father doesn\u2019t have anything from BBB right now, and I\u2019m really only guessing that he doesn\u2019t since you have to order it online and he\u2019d much rather walk into a store and walk out with something in hand than order it and wait. My father is an impatient man when it comes to his support of your blackness. But I\u2019m pretty positive that he\u2019s like so many other folks in our community who are actively supporting any and every cause as long as you tell them it\u2019s black and isn\u2019t anti-Jesus.\n\nOnce you add that to people who will support JUST because it exists, sneakerheads who believe the shoes are an investment of sorts and relationships built with schools or organizations and little white kids who like having that cool new black shit because their parents don\u2019t spend enough time with them and try to make up for it with money, the Balls are ballin\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo maybe LaVar and Lonzo were right in spurning those deals from the bigger companies. Doing it their way seems to be working for Lonzo, at least; how LiAngelo and LaMelo fare is yet to be seen. But there\u2019s more than one way to skin a cat, apparently.\n\nAnd apparently, WAY more of you all have BBB clothing than social media indicates.", "keywords": ["im", "baller", "bbb", "order", "folks", "black", "big", "exactly", "buying", "brand", "ball", "shoes", "lonzo", "products"], "polarity": 0.1099376217094664, "subjectivity": 0.44297832695890943},

OK\u2014given the price tag, it was a big \u201cI love me\u201d present, but I budget at cost-per-wear, so there\u2019s that (that\u2019s another post, for later).\n\nAnyway, I fell in love at first sight with a wool boucle collarless cocoon coat in a gorgeous burnished marigold shade from the Olsen twins\u2019 fashion line Elizabeth and James (a low-key favorite label) and have been rocking it all winter long. Not only has it brought a bright touch to otherwise gray days\u2014I also get compliments on it everywhere I go. Like, people literally stop me in the street to remark on the color, y\u2019all. Every. Single. Day.\n\nSo it was no big surprise to me when folks started calling marigold one of the colors of 2018. It\u2019s long been a personal fave of mine, evoking exotic spices, hazy summer days and just all-around saturated goodness. But imagine my delight when I discovered that Grown-ish star and perennial fave Yara Shahidi and I\u2014albeit separated by a couple of letters, generation-wise\u2014share the same great taste in outerwear (that\u2019s my coat, y\u2019all!).\n\nBut what I loved most about Yara\u2019s ensemble is that she didn\u2019t just stop at one shade of yellow; she gave us a full monochromatic spectrum, from daffodil to mustard (believe it or not, she\u2019s also wearing yellow kicks). And as one who can personally attest to yellow being my very first favorite color (seriously\u2014before I could pronounce it properly, I called it \u201clellow\u201d), it got me inspired to incorporate more sunshine shades into my wardrobe this spring and summer when my beloved wool topper is relegated to the closet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut who are we kidding? Spring starts tomorrow, so now is the time! My colleague Corey Townsend often says, \u201cBlack women invented the color yellow\u201d; I\u2019d say that if it wasn\u2019t invented by us, it was, at the very least, invented for us. I mean, who else pulls off yellow\u2014all shades\u2014better than brown-skinned ladies?\n\nScreenshot: YouTube\n\nAnd yes, I do mean all shades of brown-skinned ladies; I promise there\u2019s a yellow just right for you. Hint: Lighter-skinned ladies tend to look better in saturated hues and orange- or green-tinted yellows like saffron and ochre than buttery shades. But the more melanin, the more options\u2014which is why Viola Davis, Lupita Nyong\u2019o and Danai Gurira look amazing in any color they wear.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut if you\u2019re still hesitant to consider yellow a go-to when it comes to your sartorial choices, we\u2019ve provided a little celebrity inspiration to get you going.

When it was revealed that both the FBI and White House officials knew about the allegations against both men, it raised questions as to why they were allowed to keep their jobs and whether or not this administration enables abusers.\n\nIn a White House press briefing Monday afternoon, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders asserted that the White House takes the allegations \u201cvery seriously\u201d and believes that they should be \u201cinvestigated thoroughly.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe president and the entire administration take domestic violence very seriously and believe all allegations need to be investigated thoroughly. Above all, the president supports victims of domestic violence and believes everyone should be treated fairly and with due process. We\u2019ve addressed this situation extensively, and we have nothing more to add at this time on that topic,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nWhen asked why we haven\u2019t heard the president himself say that he supports victims, Sanders said, \u201cI spoke with the president. Those are actually directly his words that he gave me.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen pressed on the issue as to why Donald Trump hasn\u2019t said that when he\u2019s had the opportunity to do so, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s my job to speak on behalf of the president. I spoke to him, and he relayed that message directly to me, and I\u2019m relaying it directly to you.\u201d\n\nOh, really?\n\nI seem to recall last summer, when asked why the president was allowed to tweet things about special counsel Robert Mueller, Sanders specifically said that it was not her job to speak for the president.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, is it \u201cOochie Wally\u201d or is it \u201cOne Mic,\u201d Suckabee?\n\nFurthermore, it\u2019s interesting that this is the spin we are being given considering that the president has tweeted on his own about the situation, and what he said is the complete antithesis of what Sanders is saying to the American people now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Saturday, the president wrote on Twitter: \u201cPeoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation. Some are true and some are false. Some are old and some are new. There is no recovery for someone falsely accused\u2014life and career are gone. Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process?\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t sound like a man who supports victims of domestic violence. That sounds like a man who wants to gaslight victims in favor of the men accused.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen asked about the Rob Porter situation Friday, Trump defended Porter publicly and said, \u201cHe says he innocent, and I think you have to remember that.\u201d\n\nThat is the same defense he lobbed for then-Senate candidate Roy Moore back in December when allegations of inappropriate sexual contact with minors emerged about Moore.\n\nAt the time, Trump said, \u201cWell, he denies it. He says it didn\u2019t happen. And you have to listen to him also.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFurthermore, the president himself has been accused 19 times of sexual harassment and sexual abuse\u2014claims that he and the White House have labeled \u201cfake news.\u201d His administration\u2019s policies do not show any amount of care for women who are victims, either. In fact, before he even took office, his team proposed eliminating the Justice Department\u2019s violence-against-women grant programs that allocate funds to organizations that deal with sexual assault and domestic abuse.\n\nAs a woman, I\u2019m not sure how Suckabee reconciles her staunch defense of the president and his bullshit in the wake of the #MeToo movement. That she could stand at that podium and give that bullshit-ass statement is sickening. She knows what her boss has said publicly (more than once!) when it comes to accused abusers, and she continues to defend him anyway. It\u2019s gross.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s obvious the president doesn\u2019t care about victims of domestic violence.

According to Donatas Urbonas, a basketball journalist from Lithuania, Ball has a whole plan about how to make sure all the Ball kids end up playing together:\n\nAssuming that Ball is being serious and not just doing his black-dad-as-WWE-wrestling thing, that means Lonzo would not re-sign with the Lakers at the end of his rookie contract but would in turn sign only with a team willing to take the more mediocre Balls, LaMelo and LiAngelo.\n\nHe also said that if the Lakers don\u2019t want to sign LaMelo\u2014and who are we kidding? The Lakers don\u2019t want to sign LaMelo\u2014then he would bring him back to Lithuania to stash until Lonzo was done with his rookie contract, Sports Illustrated reports.\n\nHe even went so far as to note that an NBA team doesn\u2019t have to draft LaMelo or LiAngelo, and added that LiAngelo, arguably the worst of the Ball offspring, could be signed for $1 million, because he\u2019s going to be making so much money off the court that he won\u2019t need the NBA money.

On- and off-camera, her boundary-pushing, bourgeois-bohemian style was the stuff teenage fashion dreams were made of.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThirty years later, the actress\u2014while sadly no longer a regular on our TV screens\u2014is more of a muse than ever, and not only to handsome husband (and Aquaman star) Jason Momoa (or ex Lenny Kravitz). Now 50, in addition to a yogi\u2019s body and some seriously chiseled cheekbones, Bonet still possesses that mysterious aura, which she\u2019s passed down to daughter and second-generation style icon Zo\u00eb Kravitz (who also got considerable charisma from her rock-star dad, too).\n\nSo when Net-a-Porter\u2019s Porter Edit gained access to our forever muse on the remote California ranch she shares with Momoa, their younger children and several animals (including wolves and a donkey), we were all in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the resulting article featured a long-awaited comment on those Bill Cosby allegations, the accompanying editorial gave us a glimpse into the idyllic all-natural life we\u2019ve imagined Bonet living for the past couple of decades (you can read the entire article here). But it wouldn\u2019t have been complete without the perfect earth-mother-meets-haute-hippie wardrobe, which looks flawless on Bonet, and which we\u2019ll be emulating as soon as temps allow.\n\nOf course, Net-a-Porter provides easy-to-buy links to the wardrobe used in Bonet\u2019s shoot, full of gauzy fabrics, full sleeves, flowing skirts and simple jewelry. Prices range from $45 for gold-plated earrings to $995 for a ruffled silk georgette dress. But since our budgets are bit more\u2014cough\u2014modest, we did a little sourcing of our own, hoping to put our perfect summer wardrobe in place before the mercury rises.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScouring fast-fashion faves like Anthropologie and ASOS, we found an array of Bonet-worthy dresses and separates, in a decent range of sizes. Our faves? From ASOS, a plunging Grecian-styled maxi dress ($42) and corsetlike denim top with a puffed sleeve detail ($60).\n\nAnthropologie also had some easy, breezy options, albeit at a higher price point. But there were definitely a few pieces we could see wearing all summer long, bringing our cost per wear to pennies on the dollar. Think a fit-and-flare dress with a drawstring waist ($289) or a gauzy, off-the shoulder jumpsuit ($199).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the real winner in our search for Lisa Bonet-levels of bohemian chic? Festival-favorite retailer Free People, which had more options than we could possibly begin to list here. But a few dresses went straight to the top of our shopping lists, including a backless, ruffled midi dress in a canyonlike hue ($98), a slubbed-cotton midi with a plunging neckline and tied sides ($108), and a seriously sexy ribbed-knit maxi gown with full sleeves ($98) that looks as comfortable as it is current.\n\nBut while dresses may be our summer go-to for easy, effortless fashion, Free People comes through with the separates, too.

A spectrum of vibrant fabrics are stacked to the ceiling, while dress forms stand half-draped in fabric, soon to join the rack of garments hanging along one full wall. In a corner beneath dozens of spools of thread, two industrial sewing machines sit lit and ready to turn out more of designer Whitney Mero\u2019s coveted creations.\n\n\n\nMero created the label over two decades ago; when asked for the origin story, she tossed back her trademark halo of tangled golden curls in laughter: \u201cThere\u2019s a respectable version, and there\u2019s a messy version. Which would you like to hear?\u201d Of course, The Glow Up wanted to hear both.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been shapely\u2014even as a child, I had a shape that was challenging for my parents to shop for,\u201d she shared. \u201cAnd as a result of that challenge, they put me in very ugly clothes. ... How do you dress a 12-year-old shaped like a grown person?\u201d\n\nAn adolescent Mero took matters into her own hands, getting an after-school job to fund her own clothing budget, shopping at thrift stores and then redesigning her finds into fresh styles. By her junior year in high school, she was making prom dresses for classmates when an older boyfriend suggested that she turn her talent into a business. The prospect was daunting but exciting:\n\nI remember taking a trip to Buffalo to visit a friend. I was talking to her mom about my idea and what I wanted to do, but having no clue how to do any of it. And she\u2019s like, \u201cWell, with all that ass you need to call it \u2018Onion.\u2019\u201d That\u2019s the messy version. The respectable version is I\u2019m answering the question, \u201cHow to dress for different kinds of women\u2014different sizes, different shapes, different needs, all while being stylish and comfortable.\u201d And for me that answer\u2014[from] that time onto this time\u2014is Onion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Mero tells it, despite any more lascivious overtones, the term \u201cOnion\u201d originated as a Southern euphemism for shapely figures. Forgoing fashion school in favor of Spelman College in her native Atlanta, she majored in sociology while continuing to hone her craft.\n\nAfter graduation and a stint in China, she based herself and her burgeoning business in New York City, where she began hosting trunk shows for her growing clientele. That\u2019s how Mero, an introvert who admits to being leery of the social aspects of retail, likes it:\n\n\n\nGrowing up, the idea of having a store where somebody would just have access to me was just not going to happen\u2014me having a place where you could just walk in? Fuck that. So I started at an early age, very early in the business, having these trunk sales. And then you can invite the people. You can set the tone, you get to control the setting ... it never occurred to me to have brick-and-mortar\u2014not just for that reason; the overhead is murder.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer lack of overhead, coupled with the growth of online retail, provided a model that perfectly suited both Mero\u2019s personality and the growth of Onion Cut & Sewn. Her line is a rarity in the retail sector: There are no manufacturers, and everything is truly cut and sewn by hand from whole cloth in the workshop that Mero also staffs and owns. Orders are as made-to-measure as possible and take 12-14 days to produce.\n\nMero describes it as \u201cpret-a-porter meets couture,\u201d yet amazingly, every item in her extensive line of dresses, separates and jumpsuits retails for under $200. It\u2019s a point of pride for the designer, all due to the strength of her online business:\n\nOnion should not be here; it\u2019s a beautiful accident. It should have been a lot harder for me. Having a store online and being able to take payments from damn near anywhere from anyone is really what grew the business.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut while technology makes it infinitely easier to sell, it\u2019s Mero\u2019s technical skill that developed her faithful following. She loves draping and primarily cuts on the bias; in her words: \u201cI love it when fabric moves with you, as opposed to you trying to make fabric do something that it doesn\u2019t do.\u201d\n\nAs a result, her designs\u2014some with names like \u201ctrap dress\u201d and \u201cfast lady\u201d\u2014naturally flatter a variety of figures. While undeniably feminine, they are never fussy, and remarkably feel as good as they are fashionable, thanks to Onion\u2019s signature fabric: jersey. Mero stumbled upon her favorite fabric almost by accident, but it\u2019s since become instrumental in creating the comfortable couture Onion is known for:\n\nI got really sick about 10 years ago, and I needed comfortable clothes. My skin was really jacked up, and I needed something that actually was soft and comforting. I started working with jersey, and then I just fell in love with it. ... I mean, I\u2019ve seen dresses fit a size 2, put that dress down and [get] picked up by a size 16, and it worked. You know, Miss Celie\u2019s pants. But I\u2019m a huge fan of jersey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlong with her love for the stretchy, travel-friendly cottons and rayons she uses in most of her designs, Mero is seemingly also her own muse. Her enviably compact and curvy frame is an ideal and relatable mannequin for her array of body-conscious but very forgiving silhouettes, and visitors to Onion Cut & Sewn\u2019s site will find the designer herself modeling most of her collection.\n\nIt could be argued that Mero represents the type of aspirational yet accessible allure her customers are seeking with every Onion purchase. But in her studio, she is refreshingly frank and unassuming, dressed down in a hoodie with her incredible hair in orbit around a bare face, while her impeccable cobalt manicure makes one wonder how she so effectively maneuvers a sewing machine. It\u2019s all part of Mero\u2019s personal credo, which extends to Onion Cut & Sewn\u2019s philosophy:\n\nYou put something on, and you feel great. I need it to feel like pajamas. ... But you know, the goal is, at the most, fundamental: Put one thing on and be able to leave the house and feel completely comfortable and confident in what you\u2019re wearing ... I want to design a star for people\u2014something that shines on you, without you necessarily having to shine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd women truly do shine in Mero\u2019s designs. Just ask good friend and #MeToo founder Tarana Burke, who wore a sequined black dress designed by Mero to grace this year\u2019s Golden Globes carpet. As Burke told The Glow Up:\n\nWhitney is a friend, but I have a very separate obsession with Onion Cut & Sewn. There was no question that I was going to wear one of her amazing creations on the red carpet at the Golden Globes. All of the women that night shied away from questions about who they were wearing, but I couldn\u2019t wait. I was proud to wear a black designer and proud to be wearing my girl\u2019s design. She makes impeccably tailored, comfortable, beautifully designed dresses, and the world should know about them.\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison (Getty Images)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut while Mero finds Burke\u2019s choice to wear her design to the Golden Globes deeply meaningful, she says she couldn\u2019t care less about courting celebrity:\n\nYou know, people are celebrity-obsessed\u2014actually starstruck in a way that makes no sense. And I get that question: Well, what celebrities do you dress? And I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat the fuck [do] I need to dress celebrities for? I dress you. And unless you\u2019re telling me that you\u2019re not good enough\u2014which is not something I\u2019m ready to accept\u2014then stop asking me about celebrities. I don\u2019t care about a celebrity; ask them.\u201d I think that for Tarana to have basically lived a life of service without expectation, to be on the red carpet ... I love that version of it better than a model or an actor trying to be an activist, as opposed to a fashionable activist. I\u2019m not denigrating anyone, but you know the work has meaning. ... I\u2019d rather those people than celebrities, frankly, because celebrities have access to everything.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou likely also won\u2019t see Mero showing at New York Fashion Week, since she also doesn\u2019t do seasonal collections, telling us: \u201cThat means nothing to me. Whenever I want to introduce something new, I just introduce it.\u201d\n\nWhitney Mero is a woman who plays by her own rules. Similarly, her clothes represent a woman who has found both herself and her style, caring more about looking good than any fashion trend. Ironically, that\u2019s exactly what keeps an Onion Cut & Sewn design\u2014and its enchantingly irreverent designer\u2014always in fashion:", "keywords": ["im", "mero", "fabric", "dress", "dressing", "having", "whitney", "cut", "couture", "meros", "comfortable", "know", "sewn", "onion", "version"], "polarity": 0.27471558186159956, "subjectivity": 0.5654813303707109},

As part of those investigations, attorneys for Donald Trump Jr., the president\u2019s eldest son, were required to turn over to congressional investigators secret direct messages that were passed back and forth on Twitter between him and WikiLeaks.\n\nThe Atlantic obtained a copy of the messages, and writer Julia Ioffe reported that WikiLeaks asked Trump Jr. for his cooperation in sharing its work, in contesting the results of the U.S. election and in arranging for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange to be Australia\u2019s ambassador to the United States.\n\nAccording to the report, the first message was sent to Trump Jr. by WikiLeaks at midnight on Sept. 20, 2016\u2014at the height of the presidential campaign\u2014and it read: \u201cA PAC run anti-Trump site putintrump.org is about to launch. The PAC is a recycled pro-Iraq war PAC. We have guessed the password. It is \u2018putintrump.\u2019 See \u2018About\u2019 for who is behind it. Any comments?\u201d\n\nTrump Jr. responded 12 hours later and said, \u201cOff the record I don\u2019t know who that is, but I\u2019ll ask around. Thanks.\u201d\n\nThe site was an election-season blog launched by Rob Glaser, founder of RealNetworks and an early employee at Microsoft. It was funded by the Progress for USA Political Action Committee and has since moved to Mother Jones, where it now functions as a new project to report on the Trump-Russia ties and foreign influence in U.S. politics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeyond the inquiries about Putin-Trump, WikiLeaks continued to solicit Trump Jr.\u2019s cooperation until at least July 2017 with requests that included asking for Donald Trump\u2019s tax returns, urging the Trump campaign on Election Day to reject the results of the election as rigged, and requesting that the then president-elect tell Australia to appoint Assange ambassador to the United States.\n\nAlan Futerfas, an attorney for Trump Jr., told The Atlantic: \u201cOver the last several months, we have worked cooperatively with each of the committees and have voluntarily turned over thousands of documents in response to their requests. Putting aside the question as to why or by whom such documents, provided to Congress under promises of confidentiality, have been selectively leaked, we can say with confidence that we have no concerns about these documents and any questions raised about them have been easily answered in the appropriate forum.\u201d\n\nWikiLeaks did not respond to The Atlantic\u2019s requests for comment.\n\nOn Monday evening, Assange publicly tweeted that he could not confirm the DMs that The Atlantic reports to have because WikiLeaks doesn\u2019t keep those records, and The Atlantic\u2019s \u201cpresentation is edited.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA little more than an hour later, Trump Jr. tweeted copies of the DMs reported in The Atlantic\u2019s story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd for the frosting on this cake of disbelief, the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Byron Tau found this juicy little gem:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt appears that Trump Jr. colluded, and his daddy (it appears) knew it.\n\nMessy, messy, messy.\n\nThere\u2019s so much more to the story. Even after Trump won the election, WikiLeaks continued to reach out to Junior to get him to cooperate with various things, including asking him to let them leak copies of emails between himself and publicist Rob Goldstone, who had set up a meeting between Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya\u2014who has connections to Russia\u2019s powerful prosecutor general. The New York Times had broken the story three days prior.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump Jr. did not respond to the request from WikiLeaks, but hours later, he leaked the emails himself on his own Twitter feed.\n\nRead more at The Atlantic.", "keywords": ["pac", "wikileaks", "later", "requests", "deception", "election", "documents", "lies", "trump", "jr", "atlantic", "drama", "donald", "continued"], "polarity": 0.05765151515151516, "subjectivity": 0.36085227272727277},

Savenok (Getty Images for New York & Company), Charley Gallay (Getty Images for Christian Siriano), Vittorio Zunino Celotto (Getty Images), Matt Winkelmeyer (Getty Images)\n\nLast Christmas, to fight the winter blahs and celebrate our first successful month at The Glow Up, I indulged in a little \u201cI love me\u201d present. OK\u2014given the price tag, it was a big \u201cI love me\u201d present, but I budget at cost-per-wear, so there\u2019s that (that\u2019s another post, for later).\n\nAnyway, I fell in love at first sight with a wool boucle collarless cocoon coat in a gorgeous burnished marigold shade from the Olsen twins\u2019 fashion line Elizabeth and James (a low-key favorite label) and have been rocking it all winter long. Not only has it brought a bright touch to otherwise gray days\u2014I also get compliments on it everywhere I go. Like, people literally stop me in the street to remark on the color, y\u2019all. Every. Single. Day.\n\nSo it was no big surprise to me when folks started calling marigold one of the colors of 2018. It\u2019s long been a personal fave of mine, evoking exotic spices, hazy summer days and just all-around saturated goodness. But imagine my delight when I discovered that Grown-ish star and perennial fave Yara Shahidi and I\u2014albeit separated by a couple of letters, generation-wise\u2014share the same great taste in outerwear (that\u2019s my coat, y\u2019all!).\n\nBut what I loved most about Yara\u2019s ensemble is that she didn\u2019t just stop at one shade of yellow; she gave us a full monochromatic spectrum, from daffodil to mustard (believe it or not, she\u2019s also wearing yellow kicks). And as one who can personally attest to yellow being my very first favorite color (seriously\u2014before I could pronounce it properly, I called it \u201clellow\u201d), it got me inspired to incorporate more sunshine shades into my wardrobe this spring and summer when my beloved wool topper is relegated to the closet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut who are we kidding? Spring starts tomorrow, so now is the time! My colleague Corey Townsend often says, \u201cBlack women invented the color yellow\u201d; I\u2019d say that if it wasn\u2019t invented by us, it was, at the very least, invented for us. I mean, who else pulls off yellow\u2014all shades\u2014better than brown-skinned ladies?\n\nScreenshot: YouTube\n\nAnd yes, I do mean all shades of brown-skinned ladies; I promise there\u2019s a yellow just right for you. Hint: Lighter-skinned ladies tend to look better in saturated hues and orange- or green-tinted yellows like saffron and ochre than buttery shades.

Because the patriarch of the Ball clan has branded their lifestyle as big baller, then I guess the car seems fitting.\n\nLonzo took to Twitter to post video of his father dropping the top.\n\nYahoo! Sports notes that the car, a Rolls-Royce Dawn, costs some $350,000. Lonzo Ball already got himself a Rolls-Royce, and arguably the least talented of the Ball family and most likely to steal some designer shades in China, LiAngelo Ball, has gotten a Ferrari.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s over a million dollars in cars.

Dad LaVar Ball is arguably one dumbass comment away from his 15 minutes of fame being over, and word on the street is that Lithuania ain\u2019t even that excited to have the services of the other Balls.\n\nThe Balls aren\u2019t really balling like that, and I know that all of this can be pulled from them in a moment. Their shoes are a joke, and the funniest part is that they don\u2019t get that their brand is a punchline.\n\nI was initially supportive of an independent black man challenging sneaker giants like Nike and Adidas by recognizing the value-add that his sons bring.

Did you know African-American women are 3 times as likely as other ethnic groups to experience bunions, hammer or overlapping toes and flat feet ? High heels, hard shoes and even sandals can cause or exacerbate all these symptoms and conditions, so as a woman\u2014with a size 10 foot\u2014who is passionate about shoes, I\u2019m always on the hunt for shoes that are good for my feet and look good too, especially with spring now just around the corner.\n\nWhenever possible, I make it a habit to buy my shoes a half-size up, and then add a premium-quality foam insole to make even a pair of heels feel like a pair of sneakers. Good insoles don\u2019t come cheap though; they can be priced anywhere from $15.00 to $50.00 for a top-of-the-line insole that fits into a dress shoe. The good thing is you only need one pair of insoles for dress shoes and one for sneakers. It\u2019s a small investment, but one that can payoff big, as it\u2019s a way to double to your shoe wardrobe: first by extending the life of your sneakers indefinitely and also by making the rest of your shoe wardrobe a lot more comfortable, so you\u2019ll wear them all more often.\n\nThe Insole Store is one of the absolute best sources to find an insole to comfort and soothe your particular foot type or condition with insoles tailored to fit everything from sneakers to stilettos. To identify the best corrective insert for your foot, call their customer service line to describe your specific needs, from where you feel pain in your feet to the residual pain it can cause in your back. Set aside a good twenty minutes for the call, because you\u2019ll probably only need to do it once, so you\u2019ll want to get it right.\n\nFor me, sandals are always where it gets tricky. You think you\u2019re doing yourself a favor by wearing flats, but when there\u2019s no cushioning or arch support, the tips of your toes and the may be on holiday, but the rest of your foot is working overtime. Your back\u2014not to mention your pedicure\u2014pay the price. The friction of feet sliding against flip flops and sandals when you walk causes calluses on the heels and balls and of the feet. Can you say pedicure killer?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnless you\u2019re walking on sand or grass for the majority of the day (I\u2019m about that life, even though I only live it on vacation), the impact of shoes without cushioning can be a stressor for the body. One my quick remedies for relieving tension in my feet is rolling a golf ball under the soles of my feet for a quick reflexology massage. I keep one in my desk, for quick and easy relief. Try it\u2014it does wonders, I promise.\n\nI\u2019m a sneaker-head for sure, so whenever I come across shoes that feel like sneakers, I\u2019m in on the protective style tip. As we move toward Spring, Nalho sandals are my new obsession. Inspired by traditional styles like Spanish espadrilles and Indian slides, these sandals feature lush cushy soles modeled after yoga mats, with memory foam padding and soft comfortable cotton uppers. Nahlo sandals are designed to support the arch of the foot, absorb impact on the heels and cushion the ball of the foot; taking care of the three major points that can lead to issues if left unprotected.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBottom line: I love a cute shoe that\u2019s protective, but not clunky. Sexy doesn\u2019t always have to mean stiletto\u2014although trust me, if I could get away with wearing stilettos 24/7 and a diet of champagne and French fries, I would. But until we get to that point in our evolutionary\u2014or devolutionary scale\u2014I\u2019ll be tackling the ups and downs of the shoe world by doing my best to balance protecting the health of my feet with my wicked desire for style.", "keywords": ["foot", "sandals", "shoe", "spring", "protective", "good", "step", "heels", "sneakers", "feet", "forward", "styles", "shoes", "youll", "insole", "best"], "polarity": 0.2637127338070735, "subjectivity": 0.549496515015383},

Case in point: For the first time since Naomi Campbell\u2019s opening strut back in 1997, Prada tapped a black model to open its fashion show (Jourdan Dunn is the only other black model to be booked by this global powerhouse brand since 2008). The coveted career-making position went to 19-year-old Sudanese model of the moment, Anok Yai.\n\nPrada\n\nYai, who was raised in Egypt, was discovered when photographer Steven Hall\u2019s Afrocentric street-style blog The Sunk posted a photo of her at Howard\u2019s 2017 homecoming that went viral last fall. Now exploding with over 144,000 Instagram followers, she\u2019s poised to blow all the way up.\n\nLuckily, Yai happens to be represented by Kyle Hagler, president of Next Models. Hagler, one of the most powerful agents in the business, also happens to be black. Booking Prada is a triumph for model and agent alike, and though, in my opinion, the brand has a very long way to go before I would support it with my dollars or clicks, it is clearly evolving.\n\nBut overall, Milan showed a lot of beautiful black women on its fall runways. Natural hair and glowing skin were the order of the day, from Versace to Fendi.\n\nAt Versace, \u201990s neon brights mixed with punk and ska-inspired plaid and black-and-white checks were the theme. Mixed patterns and bright colors are classic vintage Versace\u2014an exuberant kind of youth riot that fashion insiders and consumers can\u2019t seem to get enough of, judging by the FX hit miniseries American Crime Story: The Assassination of Gianni Versace, not to mention the number of Versace heritage prints I once again see people wearing on the streets of New York.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProving that the trend is catching, Prada was also full of neon brights and industrial-inspired designs that reminded me a bit of designer Virgil Abloh\u2019s aesthetic at Off-White.\n\nVersace Fall/Winter 2018 (Catwalking/Getty Images) Versace Fall/Winter 2018 (Catwalking/Getty Images) Versace Fall/Winter 2018 (Catwalking/Getty Images) Versace Fall/Winter 2018 (Catwalking/Getty Images) Versace Fall/Winter 2018 (Catwalking/Getty Images) 1 / 5\n\nFendi never disappoints. With furs and leather goods designed for the last 50 years by Karl Lagerfeld in collaboration with the Fendi sisters, it\u2019s fashions oldest and longest-lasting collaboration, but the point of view is always fashion-forward and fresh.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFall/Winter 2018 at Fendi felt like streetwear cool meets a socialite from Wakanda\u2019s Jabari tribe on a Swiss ski holiday in Gstaad. Fendi captured exactly the way I want to look when it\u2019s frosty outside: Fabulous mink capes with appliqu\u00e9d florals and mink logo-printed sweatshirts came swishing down the runway, carried on perfectly padded shoulders that looked just right for the moment.

But the collection never quite seems to get its props, likely because the label lacks the flash of a star designer or the power derived from dressing celebrities necessary for a fashion house to capture a place in pop culture.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I do like its take on dressing women\u2014it\u2019s sensible and sexy in the same breath\u2014with wonderful choices for women who wear the hijab. Too often, this crucial segment of designers\u2019 clientele is not acknowledged on American or European runways.\n\nConservative Muslim women account for $266 billion (yes, BILLION) of the global clothing and footwear business. As a model, I worked very closely with designers who, in the \u201990s, did private showings after the main press presentations, offering to lengthen skirts and create matching hijabs for distribution to conservative Muslim clients. Never would you have seen a hijab-wearing model on the runways, until Dolce & Gabbana broke that barrier back in 2016. Now beautiful models with conservative beliefs are taking their turn and their respect as they walk the runways.\n\nMax Mara Fall/Winter 2018 (Catwalking/Getty Images) Max Mara Fall/Winter 2018 (Catwalking/Getty Images) Max Mara Fall/Winter 2018 (Catwalking/Getty Images) Max Mara Fall/Winter 2018 (Catwalking/Getty Images) Max Mara Fall/Winter 2018 (Catwalking/Getty Images) 1 / 5\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs I said, I like the moment we\u2019re in right now: a movement toward inclusion, and celebrating power on the runways.

Because the patriarch of the Ball clan has branded their lifestyle as big baller, then I guess the car seems fitting.\n\nLonzo took to Twitter to post video of his father dropping the top.\n\nYahoo! Sports notes that the car, a Rolls-Royce Dawn, costs some $350,000. Lonzo Ball already got himself a Rolls-Royce, and arguably the least talented of the Ball family and most likely to steal some designer shades in China, LiAngelo Ball, has gotten a Ferrari.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s over a million dollars in cars. I don\u2019t know what the Ball family is doing, but at this point, two kids are dropouts and one, the only one who\u2019s actually in the NBA, isn\u2019t having the best rookie year.\n\nBut there is a bigger point, one that I think is interwoven into the fabric of blacks and conspicuous consumption and egregious spending: This feels over the top even for this family.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. I\u2019m very familiar with the celebrity-lease game that many professionals run to appear to be living well beyond their means, but something tells me that \u201cbig ballers\u201d ain\u2019t out here leasing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m also a bit concerned that they are cashing out on their celebrity cachet. Dad LaVar Ball is arguably one dumbass comment away from his 15 minutes of fame being over, and word on the street is that Lithuania ain\u2019t even that excited to have the services of the other Balls.\n\nThe Balls aren\u2019t really balling like that, and I know that all of this can be pulled from them in a moment. Their shoes are a joke, and the funniest part is that they don\u2019t get that their brand is a punchline.\n\nI was initially supportive of an independent black man challenging sneaker giants like Nike and Adidas by recognizing the value-add that his sons bring.

Soulful\u2019s most popular single was \u201cSorry 2004.\u201d Which was a fucking genius song in both conception and execution.\n\nWhy? Well, first, the audacity of a pre-emptive nonapology. In the song, he acknowledges fucking up so much in 2003 that he has used up his apology quota, and since he\u2019s going to do better next year, here\u2019s his apology for the entire year.

According to the synopsis, \u201che\u2019s summoned to a maximum-security prison by a notorious murderer seeking clemency [played by Eric Bana]. Inside the brutal prison walls, Tutu is drawn into a dangerous, life-changing battle with the cunning criminal.\u201d\n\nRecently, The Root had a chance to speak with Mpho Tutu, Desmond Tutu\u2019s daughter and spokesperson.\n\nWhile neither Mpho nor Desmond Tutu himself played a role in the film getting made, Mpho was approached by the filmmakers to see if her father would give his blessing to the making of the film.\n\nDesmond Tutu stated that he understood it to be an artistic work, and as such was the work of the artist, whether or not he gave his blessing. He was grateful, however, to be asked for his blessing, Mpho says.

Still, for Mpho, there are pieces of the story that are very familiar: \u201cThe Truth and Reconciliation Commission was a large part of the life of South Africa, so that piece of the story was very recognizable.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMpho also believes that the film does her father\u2019s legacy justice.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that is striking about my father\u2019s legacy is that he was able to bring the stories of courage of so many South Africans into public view. What is most potent about his legacy is that he got to be a spokesperson for so many heroes and heroines. That comes through in the film,\u201d she said.\n\nAlthough the film puts her father at the forefront, Mpho says it\u2019s important to remember that there are many people with important stories that don\u2019t get told.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAlthough my father\u2019s role in this film looms large, it soon becomes evident that the real heroes and heroines of this story are those who are often called the little people\u2014people who are so often forgotten and whose names we don\u2019t know. The people whose stories we may sometimes ignore\u2014they have a crucial lesson to teach all of us about real courage, about genuine generosity and about true forgiveness,\u201d she said.\n\nMpho hopes that many people will get a chance to view this film and allow it to touch their lives.\n\nWe here at The Root hope for the same.", "keywords": ["fathers", "film", "legacy", "told", "speaks", "role", "desmond", "means", "work", "forgiven", "mpho", "father", "tutu", "south", "root"], "polarity": 0.23137566137566137, "subjectivity": 0.5533068783068783},

Just a year ago, (white) America was seduced by an affable and funny and demonstrative and bombastic man who also seemed very sure of the things he was saying. It didn\u2019t\u2014and still doesn\u2019t\u2014matter that he\u2019s full of shit. He had (and has) big-sounding ideas, easy answers to impossible questions and an uncanny ability to shift to the next pitch when the details of the current sale are asked to be provided. Donald Trump, like LaVar Ball, isn\u2019t just a salesman. He\u2019s a confidence man.\n\nWhere Ball\u2019s blackness matters, however, is when adding the context of this black man challenging the predominantly white power structures of amateur and professional sports\u2014the NCAA and the shoe companies specifically. So even if you don\u2019t particularly fuck with him (and I don\u2019t), it\u2019s hard not to root even a little bit for a man who takes those half-baked barbershop arguments and applies them on a national level.\n\nAnd also, even if he comes to them the wrong way, some of his ideas aren\u2019t exactly wrong. Pulling his youngest son, LaMelo, out of high school and then having him sign a contract with a Lithuanian pro team wasn\u2019t some sort of master plan. It was a culmination of LaVar practically getting banned from his son\u2019s school, having a fit and deciding to homeschool him, and also realizing that LaMelo would likely be ineligible to play college ball anyway because he has his own Big Baller Brand shoe. Essentially, this is a party invitation being rescinded and then you saying, \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t want to go to your wack-ass party anyway.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut if the ultimate goal is to prepare LaMelo for a career in the NBA, playing in a professional league in Europe with grown men will do that better than playing against 16- and 17-year-olds in California would. And what he\u2019s doing isn\u2019t much different from what the affluent parents of tennis prodigies have been doing for decades.\n\nThe Big Baller Brand shoe\u2014whose existence is both a dog whistle to every black man who\u2019s ever sat in a barber\u2019s chair and participated in an argument about starting \u201cour own\u201d shoe companies and a shameless cash grab by LaVar\u2014is also not a terrible idea. Why rely on them to outfit your son\u2014and make millions off of his name\u2014when you can keep the product and the money in the family?\n\nOf course, the money generated from Big Baller Brand pales in comparison with the money Lonzo Ball could have received from a shoe deal. But that\u2019s just considering the money today, in 2017, not the potential revenue in 2027. Do I think Big Baller Brand will ever be able to rival a Nike or an Adidas? No. Hell fucking no. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if, this time next year, it didn\u2019t even exist anymore. But that doesn\u2019t and wouldn\u2019t make LaVar Ball wrong. Just the wrong guy with the right idea.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd this brings us to his latest idea: a basketball league for highly ranked high school graduates who don\u2019t want to play college basketball. Out of all the half-baked sports-related arguments I\u2019ve heard in the 30-plus years I\u2019ve been in those barbershops, at those happy hours, barbecues and spades tables and on the bleachers of those midget-league football games, this is the most popular one: We (black people) should just start our own leagues.\n\nLike most half-baked ideas, it initially makes sense in a way that provides an immediate high. \u201cHmm. That might not be the worst idea,\u201d you begin to think. \u201cAll of the star NFL and NBA players are black, so what would happen if someone were somehow able to convince them to play in this new, FUBU-ass league?\u201d\n\nAnd with LaVar Ball\u2019s idea, a league like this would also address the legitimately hypocritical dynamic where highly touted athletes in predominantly white sports (baseball, tennis, golf, hockey) can skip college and start making millions as teens, while the top athletes in the \u201cblack\u201d sports (football and basketball) are forced to attend school until they\u2019re eligible to be drafted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut ... where would the money necessary to pay the proposed $100,000 salaries\u2014and the coaches and the referees and the athletic trainers and the support staff and the league administration and the specific team administrations and all the rest of the people who need to get paid for an athletic league to function\u2014come from? And where are they playing these games? He stated he wants to play at NBA arenas, but those arenas are owned by the owners of the NBA teams who play there. What owner would allow an openly competing product to rent out their venue? And who is footing the bill for the tens of millions of dollars of insurance\u2014health, legal, property, etc.\u2014necessary for any of this to happen?\n\nAnd\u2014most importantly, the league LaVar Ball wants to start already actually exists. Any high school graduate can play in the NBA G League. And get paid. And get NBA-level coaching and access to NBA-level resources and facilities.\n\nLaVar Ball isn\u2019t a stupid man, so I\u2019m sure he\u2019s aware of all of this and is already stewing up the next big idea for when he needs to provide some receipts for this one. And it, like every other idea he\u2019s had, will be pitched with his penchant for persuasion, will exist as if there\u2019s no memory of the other half-baked ideas he\u2019s had and will have enough compelling truth in it to convince you to believe in it (and him).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd that\u2019s when I\u2019ll know it\u2019s time to leave the barbershop and go home.", "keywords": ["right", "lavar", "hes", "wrong", "ideas", "black", "nba", "league", "money", "ball", "school", "play", "idea", "guy"], "polarity": 0.10404818272005771, "subjectivity": 0.5558872955747955},

Ahhh, yes! The White House press briefing. And what a show of fecal spray it was today.\n\n\n\nOn a day when Donald Trump\u2019s former campaign manager Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, Manafort\u2019s right-hand man, surrendered to authorities after a federal grand jury indicted the pair on 12 counts, White House spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders put on one of her most dazzling displays of truth bending to date.\n\nSanders executed her usual routine of evading questions by saying that she hadn\u2019t \u201cspoken to the president about it\u201d (then bish, why are you here?) and dragging Hillary Clinton\u2019s name into business that has nothing to do with her. But because this administration\u2019s motto is \u201c(Lie) faster, (cheat) higher, (bullshit) stronger,\u201d Sanders also added in a three-minute-long word problem and her best Mariah Carey impersonation.\n\nSanders wore Pepto Bismol pink to lie-apalooza the press conference, maybe because all the lies she was about to spew forth on the taxpayer dime were giving her a bad case of the bubble guts.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s a quick rundown:\n\nLOL, Sarah, Quit Playing\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSanders, who shares genes with a man who easily cracks the top three least-funny men on the planet, opted to begin the briefing with a joke.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to start the briefing today by addressing a topic I know all of you are preparing to ask me about,\u201d Sanders said to a room full of stressed-out political reporters who did not have time for this. \u201cTax reform.\u201d\n\nOhohohohoh Sarah! You got jokes!\n\n[Exhales.]\n\n\n\nMoving on.\n\n10 Reporters Walk Into a ... Wait, Where Were We?\n\nSanders, in her spiel touting tax reform, tried to draw an analogy explaining why rich people get tax breaks. To do so, she constructed what may actually be the stupidest word problem ever created\u2014one that hinged on reporters and beer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s not a word problem worth repeating because it\u2019s extremely convoluted and hinges on several factual errors: that drunk reporters know how to do math (most sober ones don\u2019t), that a reporter would have enough energy after settling the bill that she would start arguing over her savings in comparison with her colleagues (what kind of assholes are these reporters?), or that 10 reporters living and working in Washington, D.C., would only spend $100 at a bar.\n\n\n\nDid Someone Say Clinton?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd now for the moment we\u2019ve all been waiting for: when Sanders has to address the charges special counsel Robert Mueller brought against former Trump aides Manafort and Gates, as well as former Trump junior foreign policy advisor George Papadopoulos\u2019 guilty plea.\n\nFrankly, I think this is Sanders\u2019 favorite part. Watch as she proverbially clutches her faux pearls in faux-righteous anger and asks, But why aren\u2019t we talking about Hillary, though?\n\n\u201cThe real collusion scandal, as we\u2019ve said several times before, has everything to do with the Clinton campaign, Fusion GPS and Russia,\u201d Sanders said, evoking notable criminal investigator O.J. Simpson (emphasis mine).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s clear evidence of the Clinton campaign colluding with Russian intelligence to spread disinformation and smear the president to influence [the election],\u201d Sanders continued.\n\n\n\nHuh. Let me shuffle through my papers a bit here\u2014and by papers I mean these stacks of credit card offers that I hold on to as if they were my damn dowry.\n\nOh yes, funny how nann one member of the Clinton campaign has been charged by a federal prosecutor with conspiracy against the United States.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI Don\u2019t Know Her\n\nGet ready\u2014the White House is basically turning into one big Mariah Carey IDontKnowHer.gif.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen asked directly about Papadopoulos\u2019 specific relationship to Trump and his campaign, Sanders tried to distance him from the administration.\n\n\u201cIt was a volunteer position,\u201d Sanders said, making the former policy adviser sound like a teen doing a Habitat for Humanity project on spring break.\n\n\u201cNo activity was ever done in an official capacity on behalf of the campaign,\u201d Sanders continued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nManafort has pleaded guilty to making a false statement but has entered pleas of not guilty for the higher charges, including, once again, conspiracy against the whole-ass country. But as the Washington Post notes, even though Papadopoulos is a smaller fish than Manafort, his plea deal is the game changer here because it means he\u2019s actively cooperating with Mueller\u2019s investigation.\n\nAs much as Sanders wants to play down the former Trump campaign policy adviser as though he were some transfer student who showed up for one group project meeting and dipped, that plea deal indicates otherwise.

The New York Times was first to report that a senior Trump administration official said that the Secret Service stopped protecting Trump Jr. last week because he is seeking a level of privacy that he can\u2019t expect with a trail of agents following behind him.\n\nSecret Service spokeswoman Catherine Milhoan declined to comment to the Times as to whether or not Secret Service will still be protecting Trump Jr.\u2019s wife, Vanessa, and their five children.\n\n\u201cTo ensure the safety and security of our protectees and their families, we will not confirm who is currently receiving Secret Service protection,\u201d Milhoan said.\n\nThe younger Trump\u2019s decision is bringing up more questions than answers.

After federal agents served a search warrant on Manafort\u2019s home in early July, prosecutors working for special counsel Robert Mueller reportedly threatened Manafort with an impending indictment.\n\nIs it possible that Trump Jr. is dumping his Secret Service protection because he has something to hide? After all, Secret Service agents are considered to be law enforcement, and they could be called to testify about things they may have heard.\n\nIt\u2019s all very intriguing, and just the latest episode in the shit show that is this presidential administration that, at this point, could be considered a criminal enterprise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTune in tomorrow for the next episode of White House Apprentice.", "keywords": ["russia", "secret", "intensifies", "agents", "gives", "muellers", "trump", "younger", "presidents", "jrs", "jr", "york", "service", "investigation", "protection"], "polarity": -0.012259056732740947, "subjectivity": 0.4474760765550239},

The Big Baller Brand CEO isn\u2019t just telling his kids to skip college\u2014he\u2019ll soon be offering top high school prospects a paid alternative to the National Collegiate Athletic Association.\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, Ball announced that he\u2019s starting the Junior Basketball Association, a paid basketball league for top high school prospects that would serve as an alternative to college. I can already hear the NCAA gearing up to shut all this down.\n\nBall shared news of the league with Slam magazine in this statement:\n\n\n\nWe have officially launched our own pro basketball league called the \u201cJunior Basketball Association,\u201d sponsored by Big Baller Brand. The JBA is the very first junior pro basketball league of its kind. The JBA will cater to the top ranked high school basketball prospects in America. All nationally ranked high school seniors, whose main goal are to reach the NBA, will be offered an opportunity to join the JBA, turning pro straight out of high school and bypassing the usual college pit stop. The participating players will be paid up to $10,000 per month, as they prepare to enter the NBA Draft the following year. The JBA league is for basketball players who intend to pursue the sport professionally. With the introduction of the JBA, allowing the NCAA to regulate and control the eligibility status of top basketball prospects will no longer be an issue. There is no need to partake in an institution that claims its purpose is not to help you prepare for your professional career. The recent statement from the President of the NCAA Mark Emmert when commenting on the recent withdrawal of LiAngelo Ball from UCLA sums it up: \u201cIs this a part of someone being part of your university as a student-athlete or is it about using college athletics to prepare yourself to be a pro? If it\u2019s the latter, you shouldn\u2019t be there in the first place.\u201d -Mark Emmert And we agree! For decades, the NCAA has run a business that has exploited thousands of teens, while college institutions, coaches, media conglomerates, and corporate sponsors have all profited from the model. The JBA is a long-awaited solution to this ongoing problem. Stay tuned for more information in the coming weeks. For updates visit jbaleague.com\n\nThis idea is genius!\n\nFor years the NCAA has had a stranglehold on collegiate talent. That talent has brought in tons of money for schools while leaving the players high and dry. NCAA players are not paid for their services, most are not allowed to work during their time with the school, and they don\u2019t see a penny of the money the NCAA makes off of their abilities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere have been tons of arguments written about why college athletes deserve to be paid, including this one that I like. Not to mention, the myth of the \u201cstudent-athlete\u201d was really created so that schools wouldn\u2019t have to consider students as employees and therefore would never have to pay students who play sports for them.\n\nAn alternative junior varsity league would appeal to students who are going to college solely to major in sports\u2014a game that the athletic prospect, the colleges and universities, and the NBA are all in on.\n\nIn the 2000s, there was a mad dash by high school prospects declaring for the NBA draft, weakening the NCAA product. To circumvent that, in 2006, the NBA instituted a rule that each player had to be at least 19 years old or have at least one year of college under his belt before declaring for the draft. This wasn\u2019t done accidentally; it was done purposefully so that schools could continue to benefit from top talent attending their programs. The creation of said rule also spawned the notoriously abused one-and-done aspect of college basketball in which a player plays just one year to become eligible for the draft and then sends his old school the deuces.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NBA is now considering changing the age of NBA draft entry to 20.\n\nLaVar Ball is a black man, and owning a league that will now bypass the NCAA makes him a dangerous black man. It\u2019s one thing for him to make decisions for his own money: Currently, Ball has pulled two of his sons\u2014LaMelo from Chino Hills High School, and LiAngelo from UCLA\u2014and has them both signed up to play for a Lithuanian team. But it\u2019s another to mess with the NCAA\u2019s money. And we are talking about potentially millions of dollars in loss for schools should this actually become a viable alternative. That makes Ball a target.\n\nThis is different from Ball\u2019s boisterous claims of how he could beat Michael Jordan, or his beef with Charles Barkley. This is even bigger than his son\u2019s international incident in China and his war of words with the president. This is another league\u2014controlled by a black man\u2014and there is nothing scarier in this world than a white man losing his power. Should this league become a success, for the first time ever, the NCAA won\u2019t have a firm grab on young basketball talent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the end, I want to see LaVar Ball win. Anyone bucking up against the system and changing the status quo, especially where it favors black men, is a hero to me.\n\nBut I\u2019m worried that this time, the loudmouth may have barked up the wrong tree.\n\nRead more at Slam magazine.", "keywords": ["prospects", "war", "lavar", "declared", "high", "going", "college", "jba", "isnt", "end", "league", "ball", "tells", "ncaa", "basketball", "nba", "school"], "polarity": 0.07274117991509295, "subjectivity": 0.4297840726101594},

Just this afternoon, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the president\u2019s primary propagandist and agent of misinformation, declared today to be too soon to talk gun control before pivoting, midbreath, to blow a Chicago dog whistle.

It\u2019s there because we know exactly how many black people would have to die in a mass shooting before America decided to give a shit about gun control.

Then, of course, the NRA\u2019s need to be a source of white identification\u2014and the aggressively white affinity to possess the ability to stockpile killing machines\u2014would no longer exist.

On Monday the senior-most Ball announced that he was pulling his middle son, LiAngelo, from UCLA. Big Ball was upset that the school had placed his son and two other students\u2014Cody Riley and Jalen Hill\u2014on indefinite suspension after the three student-athletes were caught shoplifting in China.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sitting back and waiting,\u201d LaVar Ball told ESPN. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t punished this bad in China.\n\n\u201cWe get back over here and the consequences were even stiffer than China,\u201d he continued. \u201cSo basically they\u2019re in jail here.\u201d\n\nSo Daddy Ball is pulling his son out of college. In October he pulled his youngest son, LaMelo, then a junior at Chino Hills high school, out of school after a disagreement about the system the coach planned to implement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo far, the lone Ball success has been the progression of Lonzo, who was a one-and-done player at UCLA before being drafted No. 2 by the Los Angeles Lakers in the 2016 NBA draft. While the jury is still out on Lonzo, his rookie season is about what many expected: flashes of dominance marred by a really ugly jump shot and stretches where he disappears on the court. Which is hard to do when your dad might be the loudest person in Staples Center, drawing so much attention to the first-year player that the team has reportedly implemented the \u201cLaVar Ball rule.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s how ESPN breaks down the rule:\n\n[T]he Los Angeles Lakers are enforcing a policy that no longer allows members of the media to congregate in a section of the arena among family and associates of players after games. Family, friends and agents wait for players in the seats behind the basket closest to the visiting team\u2019s locker room at the end of games. Interviews conducted in that designated area and near the tunnel leading to the arena corridors are now forbidden. In prior years, media socialized and, at times, interviewed individuals in that sector without interference. If a media member is recognized in that area now, arena security or Lakers staffers direct that he or she leave the area.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow that LiAngelo is no longer a student at UCLA, the biggest Ball can get back to what seems to drive all his decision-making: money. Even LaVar Ball\u2019s well-publicized feud with President Donald Trump has been a moneymaking exploit that includes Ball sending the president three pairs of red-white-and-blue Big Ball Brand sneakers to show that the Ball family is patriotic.\n\nNow the NCAA doesn\u2019t have to look through its phonebook-sized rulebook to see if a student with his own signature shoe playing in college violates any regulations, because Daddy Ball took care of that. Instead of pulling the sneaker, he pulled his son from school, and ESPN is already announcing that there are plans for the release of the Gelo 3.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd now the senior Ball is reportedly looking to ship both LiAngelo and LaMelo overseas, thus ending their collegiate careers before they began. And until they succeed, which I hope they do, they are effectively high school and college dropouts.\n\nI never thought I\u2019d have to say this in print, but LaVar Ball is out of his damn LaMind.\n\nNot because he pulled his middle son out of college, but because he pulled his middle son who isn\u2019t nearly as talented as his first child, Lonzo. His middle child also does not have the upside of his youngest son, LaMelo. In truth, LiAngelo shoplifted before\u2014when he stole a scholarship from UCLA. Had he stayed in college and earned his degree, that wouldn\u2019t have been a robbery; it would have been a fair exchange: a decent degree for what was most likely going to be a decent career.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Daddy Ball has gone full cheerleader mom by pulling his son out of college. So LiAngelo gets caught stealing, and the university puts him and the other two students who were caught with him on indefinite suspension. This was an opportunity for LiAngelo to grow up and show that he\u2019d learned his lesson. Does it matter if he actually learns anything? Hell no. But coaches and organizations like to be able to look at how players handle adversity, and they don\u2019t have that now because Daddy Ball took him out of school.\n\nSo unless your cable network gets basketball games in Jakarta, Indonesia, or unless LiAngelo can team up with two washed-up NBA veterans and join the Big3, we may never get to see him play ball. LaVar is a big talker and even bigger gambler, and while his \u201cbit\u201d as a loudmouth know-it-all worked alongside Lonzo\u2019s quiet demeanor and unique basketball abilities, LiAngelo is not Lonzo.\n\nHere\u2019s what NBA senior analyst Adrian Wojnarowski had to say about LiAngelo\u2019s prospects for playing at the next level.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI don\u2019t see an NBA team taking a chance on a middle-of-the-road player who they didn\u2019t see compete against top college talent because his daddy, whom they know they\u2019re going to have to deal with, pulled him out of school. LaVar Ball really burned LiAngelo with this move, and I think NBA execs, coaches and staff are getting a little tired of the Big Baller Brand and all that comes with it.", "keywords": ["career", "pulled", "lavar", "hes", "son", "liangelo", "ruined", "ucla", "college", "trump", "sneakers", "sent", "ball", "school", "daddy", "nba", "mind", "liangelos"], "polarity": 0.06887222222222224, "subjectivity": 0.3920444444444444},

They usually start out gently: a meeting with someone or some people who appear to be harmless whose assignment is mostly trying to engage the level of interest or culpability of the westerner.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cA meeting in New York between a woman who has ties to the Kremlin with Donald Trump Jr. and a few other people, for example.\n\n\u201c2.

If for example, the object says \u2018I love it\u2019 [as did Trump Jr.], the Russians know they have snagged a Big Fish.\n\n\u201c3. Once the Russians gauge success, they develop a plan for reeling the fish in, eventually splitting him (or her) in half and having a good lunch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo, in my view, the below Washington Post article is spot on.\u201d\n\nLee, who worked for the Post in Moscow and elsewhere as a foreign correspondent and then as a travel writer, now is co-owner and general manager of Las Canteras, a Peruvian restaurant in Washington.\n\nHis concluding reference was to a Washington Post opinion piece by Rolf Mowatt-Larssen, director of the Intelligence and Defense Project at Harvard University\u2019s Belfer Center. He served for three years as director of intelligence and counterintelligence at the Department of Energy and for 23 years as a CIA intelligence officer in domestic and international posts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the essay, posted Friday, Mowatt-Larssen said, \u201cWe should be cautious about overestimating the significance of this episode in isolation. Russia may have extended other feelers to other Trump associates at other points in time. Indeed, the Steele dossier suggests that the Kremlin was trying to cultivate the Trumps as far back as 2011. But, based on the publicly available information, the June 2016 overture seems to have been a win for Russia.\n\n\u201cIt helped set the stage for the possibility of subsequent contacts between Trump associates and witting agents of the Russian government. (Some of these contacts are now known; others, perhaps not.) And it would have allowed Russian intelligence to be comfortable initiating the next phase of its operation \u2014 systematically leaking information on Clinton and trying to penetrate the U.S. voting process \u2014 with the knowledge that the Trump campaign was interested in such Russian government assistance.\n\n\u201cAlthough the Kremlin could have meddled without active or tacit approval from the campaign, having the campaign on board would have made the meddling more effective. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLee is among only a handful of African Americans who have covered Russia for mainstream U.S. outlets.

We accept her apology.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe contrition followed 48 hours in which White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the \u201cSportsCenter\u201d co-host should be fired, the National Association of Black Journalists stood by Hill\u2019s free-speech rights, and others debated the role of ESPN in the media universe, Trump\u2019s stance toward African Americans, particularly black women, the meaning of \u201cwhite supremacy\u201d and how the reaction to Hill compared with that accorded others who made controversial statements.\n\nAs reproduced Wednesday by David Mack of BuzzFeed, Hill\u2019s since-deleted Monday night tweets included, \u201cDonald Trump is a white supremacist who has largely surrounded himself w/ other white supremacists\u201d and \u201cTrump is the most ignorant, offensive president of my lifetime. His rise is a direct result of white supremacy. Period.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsked about that in the White House briefing room Wednesday, Sanders said, \u201cI think that\u2019s one of the more outrageous comments that anyone could make, and certainly something that I think is a fireable offense by ESPN.\u201d\n\nSanders\u2019 comments were immediately denounced by journalists, who said Sanders had crossed a line. The White House publicly calling for the firing of a private citizen for expressing her views? Other presidents have complained about reporters in private, but not at a news conference.\n\nIt became yet another threshold crossed by the Trump presidency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Pete Vernon wrote Thursday in his Columbia Journalism Review newsletter, \u201cThough questions about what journalists can and should say on their personal social media feeds didn\u2019t begin with Trump, his rise \u2014 and the politicization of nearly all aspects of American culture \u2014 have forced the issue. Politico\u2019s managing editor recently waded into this larger controversy when he told staffers that the company discards \u2018dozens\u2019 of job applications over inappropriate or partisan tweets.\n\nVernon added, \u201cHill is hardly the first media figure to associate Trump with white supremacy. Last month, both The New Yorker and The Economist featured covers depicting the president and the white hood of the Ku Klux Klan. Ta-Nehisi Coates wrote that Trump\u2019s \u2018ideology is white supremacy\u2019 in last week\u2019s widely read Atlantic story.\n\n\u201cSo why did Hill\u2019s comments become an issue worthy of an official response from the lectern? In part, because conservative media figures like sentient hot-take Clay Travis and perpetually confused Tucker Carlson made it one. Some journalists suggested Sanders\u2019s response was a deliberate attempt by the administration to distract from bigger issues. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat Hill is a black woman did not escape Brittney Cooper, associate professor of women\u2019s and gender studies and Africana Studies at Rutgers University. Cooper noted on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cAll In With Chris Hayes\u201d Wednesday that the Trump White House has also disparaged reporter April Ryan and Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., other black women.\n\nHas Trump embraced white supremacy? \u201cThere is something Donald Trump did to get into office that we haven\u2019t seen in 150 years,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cWhere did she lie?\u201d Jason Johnson, theRoot.com\u2019s political editor who joined Cooper in the segment, asked about Hill.\n\nThe accuracy of Hill\u2019s statements and the fear that racism is being even more normalized were enough for many African Americans to support Hill.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOur society abounds with white people who are more likely to be disturbed at being called racist than they are to be disturbed by racism,\u201d Jarvis DeBerry wrote for NOLA.com | the Times-Picayune. \u201cConsequently, people will condemn Hill without even pausing to consider the accuracy of her allegation.\u201d\n\nMoreover, some don\u2019t view the meaning of the words \u201cwhite supremacy\u201d as static. Washington journalist John McQuaid argued on Facebook that \u201cThe commonly-accepted meaning used to refer to people espousing an explicit \u2018whites are superior\u2019 ideology \u2013David Duke, et al. But thanks in part to Ta-Nehisi Coates, a broader definition has gained currency \u2013 the structure of white privilege embedded (often non-explicitly or unconsciously) in institutions and attitudes.\n\n\n\n\u201cIs Trump promoting this type of white supremacy? Arguably, yes. But the term is still charged and many/most white people (in particular) are going to equate it saying \u2018you are another David Duke.\u2019\u201d\n\nAndy Borowitz, satirist for the New Yorker magazine, said Trump wouldn\u2019t qualify in any case. \u201cUpbraiding the ESPN anchor Jemele Hill for calling Donald Trump a \u2018white supremacist,\u2019 the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said on Wednesday that \u201cno one has done more than President Trump to prove that white people are not superior,\u2019 \u201d Borowitz wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, Hill\u2019s tweets were red meat for right-wingers who love to hate on ESPN \u2014 and Hill.\n\nOn blacksportsonline.com Tuesday, Robert Littal compiled \u201cA Collection of Tweets Just From Today of Trump Supporters Calling Jemele Hill a Nigger.\u201d\n\nHill is a former columnist at the Orlando Sentinel. \u201cSportsCenter\u201d is an opinion show. In the debate over Hill\u2019s tweets, some confused the obligations of straight-news reporters with those of commentators, even though they correctly noted that comments on social media and on the air might be subject to different standards.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKevin Draper wrote Wednesday in the New York Times, \u201cThe network has reoriented its programming more toward opinion and debate, encouraging some hosts to veer away from sports. Hill\u2019s \u2018SportsCenter\u2019 often mixes sports with social and cultural topics. Hill, who is black, and her co-host, Michael Smith, who is also black, frequently discuss black culture \u2014 uncommon for an ESPN show.\n\n\u201cESPN is hardly without conservative representation. Hill\u2019s tweets were posted about an hour before the second broadcast of ESPN\u2019s \u2018Monday Night Football\u2019 doubleheader. The analyst for that game was Rex Ryan, who introduced President Trump at a rally last year. The show\u2019s anthem was sung by Hank Williams Jr., a conservative who was once dropped by ESPN for comparing President Obama to Hitler. . . .\u201dESPN\u2019s mixing of sports and politics is not going to change anytime soon, Jim Brady, ESPN\u2019s public editor, wrote in April.\n\n\u201cThere is no denying that culture, sports and politics are fused together more today than at any time in recent memory, and there\u2019s an argument to be made that ESPN is rightfully taking advantage of that trend. But there\u2019s also no denying the presence of a fervent fan base that prefers the ESPN of old, meaning these worlds will continue to collide,\u201d Brady wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOne thing is clear: Those of you who have not held your tongue about ESPN\u2019s move away from an all-sports-all-the-time mantra also should not hold your breath waiting for a change.\n\n\u201cESPN has made it clear: It\u2019s not sticking to sports.\u201d\n\nAaron Blake, Washington Post: White House says Jemele Hill calling Trump a racist is a \u2018fireable offense.\u2019 Trump once called Obama a racist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJim Brady, ESPN: New ESPN guidelines recognize connection between sports, politics (April 4)\n\nPhilip Bump, Washington Post: Trump\u2019s press secretary offers suggested punishments for two Trump critics\n\nBryan Curtis, theringer.com: Deep Six: Jemele Hill and the Fight for the Future of ESPN\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJarvis DeBerry: NOLA.com | Times-Picayune: ESPN\u2019s Jemele Hill was spot-on when she called Donald Trump a white supremacist\n\nRichard Deitsch, Sports Illustrated: ESPN Employees Respond to Jemele Hill Controversy over Trump Comments\n\nKevin Draper, New York Times: Comments by Jemele Hill of ESPN a \u2018Fireable Offense,\u2019 White House Says\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavid Mack, BuzzFeed: The White House Says ESPN Should Fire Jemele Hill For Calling Trump An Ignorant White Supremacist\n\nNational Association of Black Journalists: Statement from the National Association of Black Journalists on Jemele Hill\n\nNicholas Parco, Daily News, New York: Colin Kaepernick shows support for Jemele Hill and her tweet calling President Trump a \u2018white supremacist\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCarron J.

The selflessness and deference to the man of the hour, they said, was the power of Vance.\n\n\u201cEvery single one had something to share about their love for this guy,\u201d said Harris, a recent arrival at Vance\u2019s shop from rival WJLA-TV.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt says so much about this guy. I\u2019m now shaking in my shoes, \u2018cause I realize what this man meant to this town. It\u2019s humbling to walk down the same hallways.\u201d And Vance did it \u201cjust by being himself,\u201d Harris said.\n\nEight hundred people were at Washington\u2019s National Cathedral Tuesday morning for an invitation-only memorial service for Vance, which was televised on NBC\u2019s owned-and-operated WRC-TV.\n\nVance had become such a local icon that in June his image was unveiled on the outdoor wall of Ben\u2019s Chili Bowl, a favorite tourist spot. He spent 48 years at WRC before succumbing to lung cancer July 22 at age 75.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe two-hour service at Washington National Cathedral was as close to a party as you could have in such grandiose surroundings,\u201d Roxanne Roberts wrote Tuesday in the Washington Post.\n\n\u201cThere was lots of music, laughter and a guest list of Washington\u2019s broadcasting and political elite: the entire Channel 4 family, of course, plus Gordon Peterson, Paul Berry, Arch Campbell, Chris Matthews, Katie Couric, Willard Scott, Mayor Muriel Bowser, former attorney general Eric Holder and Redskins quarterback Sonny Jurgensen. . . .\u201d\n\nVance was proud of his Philadelphia roots even as he and the nation\u2019s capital embraced each other, but he had more than local significance. An inductee into the National Association of Black Journalists Hall of Fame, Vance became an example of the importance of local news anchors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know of anything definitive recently that\u2019s been written about the importance of local anchors,\u201d Mike Cavender, then executive director of the Radio Television Digital News Association, told Journal-isms after Vance\u2019s passing.\n\n\u201cNews research, generally, shows they are among the most trusted components of TV News in terms of trustworthiness and believability\u2026.and are a major reason why local TV news is among the most trusted news sources of them all in the United States. Jim Vance is certainly a classic example of that on so many levels\u2026and his tenure at WRC-TV is a major reason why that station for so long has been at the top of the ratings in DC.\u201d\n\nBowser told the crowd, Vance \u201cdidn\u2019t just deliver the news, he engaged in a conversation with us.\u201d His co-anchor Doreen Gentzler reminded the audience that for all Vance\u2019s comfort in his own skin and other personal attributes, he was a skilled reporter who could edit adeptly on the fly as the Teleprompter rolled.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome said afterward that they were surprised that the service was \u201cunapologetically black,\u201d as NBC\u2019s Craig Melvin, the master of ceremonies, described Vance himself. That was no small feat in a town once known as \u201cChocolate City\u201d but where gentrification has eroded that sobriquet. A recent book has rechristened D.C. \u201cCappuccino City.\u201d Yet, as the Undefeated writer Mike Wise said of Vance when the service ended, \u201cHe was a hero to all of Washington.\u201d\n\nThe program featured several of Vance\u2019s red-coated Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity brothers from Cheyney State College in the early 1960s. Led by Kenneth \u201cQP\u201d Hamilton, who first met Vance in 1960, they sang the Kappa anthem. They recalled that the late Ed Bradley, who went on to become the noted \u201c60 Minutes\u201d correspondent, was Vance\u2019s roommate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Moonlighters, a doo-wop group all sporting royal blue ties and dark suits, underscored Vance\u2019s love of that genre \u2014 he and his Cheyney football teammates would sing on the bus ride home after inevitably losing away games. The Moonlighters\u2019 song of choice for this occasion was, \u201cYou Gave Me Peace of Mind.\u201d\n\nThe Howard University Gospel Choir represented the black religious tradition, singing \u201cGoin\u2019 Up Yonder\u201d early in the service.\n\nAnd in a voice reminiscent of Paul Robeson, one listener said, Pastor Wintley Phipps, an education activist and founder of the U.S. Dream Academy, which runs an after-school mentoring program, sang \u201cWe Shall Overcome.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, Cheney alum Wendell Whitlock noted, Vance and his buddies could also sing challenging operatic passages.\n\nAs befit the occasion, the speakers told anecdotes. Melvin recalled that on arriving to town, Vance invited him to partake of the best steaks in Washington. The establishment turned out to be a strip club. \u201cHe wanted to see what kind of a guy I was,\u201d Melvin related. \u201cWould I freak out?\u201d Melvin said he didn\u2019t.\n\nLongtime radio and television host Donnie Simpson told of the friendship he and Vance developed, with Vance taking the younger man under his wing. At first Simpson was surprised to find that \u201ctheir anchor desk was as black as the Pittsburgh Steelers defensive line. So this is the Chocolate City I\u2019ve heard so much about?\u201d he mused.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThough Vance never knew Simpson\u2019s father, when the anchor heard of his passing, he flew to Detroit to attend the funeral, returning to D.C. in time for his 6 p.m. news broadcast. \u201cThat\u2019s how you tell a brother you love him,\u201d Simpson said.\n\nLater, Simpson told of turning down a radio contract because \u201csometimes when you grab the money on the table, you leave your dignity on the floor.\u201d Vance signaled his approval during his newscast that night.\n\nJohnny Allen alluded to Vance\u2019s public battles with cocaine addiction, declaring, \u201cyou have to find joy in who you are.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaya Angelou once said, \u201cI\u2019ve learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.\u201d\n\nVance\u2019s stepson, Brendon Pinkard, echoed that. Of what he gleaned from anecdotes about his father, Pinkard said, what most came through was \u201chow he made them feel when they were around him. He made them feel as though they were the most important person in the room.\u201d\n\nHamilton, Vance\u2019s Kappa comrade, approved of the service. \u201cEven though he said he didn\u2019t want anything like this, he would have been pleased,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cI know. I was his buddy. All he said was \u2018have a big party and drink some tequila.\u2019 \u201c\n\nAdvertisement\n\nESPN\u2019s Michael Wilbon, seated behind former attorney general Holder and his wife, Sharon Malone, also was pleased. \u201cIt was uplifting,\u201d Wilbon said after the service. \u201cI\u2019m not in awe of many people,\u201d as he is constantly around celebrities, Wilbon said, \u201cbut Vance is one.\u201d He cited the hometown hero\u2019s charisma and authenticity.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have many heroes. I was always in awe of him \u2018til the day he died.\u201d\n\nMike Wise, the Undefeated: Television anchor Jim Vance was a hero in black Washington (July 24)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWRC-TV, Washington: Celebrating the Life of Jim Vance (videos and text)\n\n\n\nOmarosa Reportedly Isolated in White House\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOmarosa Manigault made her name as one of reality TV\u2019s most notorious and hated personalities: the breakout star on season one of Donald Trump\u2019s NBC series The Apprentice,\u201d Lachlan Markay and Asawin Suebsaeng reported Tuesday for the Daily Beast.\n\n\n\n\u201cThirteen-years later, she is in the White House, not on a makeshift television set. But she\u2019s still trying to win Trump\u2019s favor and she still has the same villainous image she earned on NBC.\n\n\u201cAccording to four sources in and outside the West Wing, the longtime Trump confidant is isolated inside 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue as she quietly plots against her fellow senior officials.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cColleagues regularly complain about Manigault\u2019s behavior and work ethic. She frequently derails internal meetings with irrelevant or counterproductive interjections and she\u2019s earned a reputation for attempting to micromanage White House communications operations.\n\n\u201cWhite House chief of staff John Kelly has tried to curtail Manigault\u2019s direct access to the president, as The Daily Beast reported earlier this month. But her continued proximity to Trump \u2014 he speaks with her over the phone, even in the middle of the night \u2014 underscores just how thorny her tenure has been for those tasked with managing the administration. . . . .\u201d\n\nMarkay and Suebsaeng also wrote, \u201cWhite House officials say that during meetings that include Manigault, aides will often take out their smartphones and start messaging each other saying they wished she would stop talking or leave the room entirely. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOmarosa Newman, her married name, was also mentioned in a Friday story by Maggie Haberman and Glenn Thrush in the New York Times.\n\n\u201cAt a staff meeting on Wednesday, Mr. Trump\u2019s new chief of staff, John F. Kelly, announced a number of seemingly quotidian internal moves, capped by the appointment of Kirstjen Nielsen \u2014 his brusque, no-nonsense longtime aide \u2014 as an assistant to the president and his principal deputy,\u201d they wrote.\u201dShe is also responsible for keeping Mr. Kelly\u2019s no-fly list of aides he deems to be unfit to attend serious meetings, the most prominent of whom is Omarosa Manigault, the former \u2018Apprentice\u2019 star with an ill-defined job and a penchant for dropping into meetings where she was not invited. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhotographers of Color Let Editors Know They Exist\n\nBrent Lewis, 27, has created a website with a searchable database of some 340 experienced photographers of color with details and contacts exclusively for photo editors, James Estrin and David Gonzalez reported Wednesday for the \u201cLens\u201d blog of the New York Times.\n\n\u201cThe move is part of Diversify Photo, a new organization devoted to \u2018creating a place where people can come and see photographers of color, to know they are out there and they exist, and to provide editors with the ability to find people not in their circles.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEarlier this year, Mr. Lewis and Andrea Wise, a freelance photo editor, put out an open call on social media to photographers who identify as \u2018being of color.\u2019 One thousand five hundred people replied and filled out the questionnaire.\n\n\u201cWith the assistance of a team of editors including Elijah Sinclair Walker, Jennifer [Samuel] and Jehan Jillani of National Geographic; Jessie Wender and Elizabeth Krist, formerly of National Geographic; Dudley Brooks of The Washington Post; and Michael Wichita of AARP. They winnowed the list to about 340 who they had confidence would be consistent in fulfilling freelance assignment work.\n\n\u201cDiversify Photo . . . whose website is sponsored by Visura, which itself was founded by Adriana Teresa Letorney, a Puerto Rican media entrepreneur \u2014 will create educational, career development and mentorship programs for photographers of color including college students, Mr. Lewis said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe also plans to work with like-minded groups like Women Photograph and Reclaim to push for more diverse perspectives in visual storytelling. Broadening perspectives on race, class and gender is a much-needed challenge to traditional approaches that reinforce \u2018a monolithic point of view,\u2019 said Rhea Combs, curator of film and photography at the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture. . . .\u201d\n\nThe piece includes this passage about this column\u2019s perspective:\n\n\u201cThe desire to have their voices heard \u2014 and the issues that mattered covered \u2014 has long been of concern in the African-American community, said Richard Prince, the editor of Journal-isms, a website devoted to diversity in journalism. He dates it to the country\u2019s first black newspaper, Freedom\u2019s Journal, whose editors declared in 1827: \u2018We wish to plead our own cause. Too long have others spoken for us.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhile a similar impulse led to the creation of influential, black-owned newspapers like The Chicago Defender, it was not enough to influence mainstream media. Indeed, among the sobering findings of the Kerner Commission report after urban unrest in the 1960s was a call for more diversity in mainstream media. [PDF, go to Chapter 15]\n\n\u201c \u2018The industry began to stir itself out of complacency in 1978, when the American Society of News Editors started a staff census of newspapers around the country. When the group found that the percentage of minority journalists in American newsrooms was just 3.95 percent in 1978, it set an industry goal to match the percentage of journalists to the percentage of people of color in the general population by the year 2000.\n\n\u201cThe goal was not met, with the percentage of minorities in newsrooms hovering at between 12 to 17 percent for the last decade. Instead, 2025 was set as the new target. This does not surprise Mr. Prince, who had been an editor at The Washington Post. Despite improvements in some newsrooms during the 1980s and 1990s, progress has stalled as the industry faced economic and structural upheaval.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c \u2018The rise of the internet, and the precariousness of the financial condition of newspapers, caused a lot of the owners to forget all about diversity and say, \u201cWe have to worry about own bottom line and survival,\u201d not realizing that what also was happening at the same time were demographic changes in the population that made diversity even more important because the consumer base was changing,\u2019 he said. \u2018It\u2019s supposed to be a majority minority country by 2050, I believe.\u2019\n\n\u201cIn addition to bringing about a cultural shift within companies, there needs to be accountability, too. Mr. Prince echoed the sentiment of many when he said that hiring needs to reflect diversity goals, which may come only through the recognition of the power of one particular color: green. \u2018If you don\u2019t produce diversity among the section that you are responsible for, then your salary is affected,\u2019 Mr. Prince said. \u2018That gets people\u2019s attention.\u2019 . . . \u201c\n\nPablo Manriquez, HuffPost: Award-Winning Latina Photojournalist Chronicles Houston\u2019s Undocumented Hurricane Victims\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNina Garcia Named Editor of Elle Magazine\n\n\u201cNina Garcia will be the next editor of Elle magazine, Hearst announced Tuesday morning,\u201d Matthew Schneier reported Tuesday for the New York Times.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cUntil now the creative director of Marie Claire magazine, Ms. Garcia has a name and a tart take on style known to millions in her capacity as a longtime judge on \u2018Project Runway.\u2019 She is also the author of four books on fashion.\n\n\u201c \u2018Look at the issue of empowerment around young working women and the obsession with fashion and beauty.

My son stirred some deeper thoughts. It\u2019s not that I hate the game; it\u2019s that my distrust of its stewards is at an all-time high, and the NFL leads the way with its clumsy, reckless and self-serving leadership. The problem isn\u2019t one thing. It\u2019s the whole buffet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI dread the start of another NFL season. I dread it because obsession is about to drown out concern again. I dread that my work is about to help fuel this obsession. Every sport has issues, but the attention the NFL receives and the money it makes allow for blind arrogance to take over every fall and winter. The NFL has suffered some dings to its popularity, but the damage is minor thus far, barely noticeable, which means the league will go on abusing responsibility and creating an awful example for how to maintain the game.\n\n\u201cThe issues are vast and diverse. They include the NFL\u2019s ongoing failure to commit to a more responsible way to do objective research and protect its players from the effects of concussions and brain injuries caused by playing football. And the limited resources and lack of compassion given to retired athletes who wrecked their bodies to provide entertainment.\n\n\u201cAnd the blackballing of Colin Kaepernick and the overall NFL ambivalence toward its players\u2019 legitimate concerns about equality and social justice. And the confusing and contradictory way that the league disciplines its players, from Tom Brady to Ezekiel Elliott, which consistently shows that it is more concerned about perception than fairness or rehabilitation. And the culture of fighting the players over every dime, which leads to contentious contract negotiations even for stars such as Le\u2019Veon Bell and Aaron Donald.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAll of these grievances fall under one huge, disheartening umbrella: The NFL doesn\u2019t respect humanity.

And, surely, the NCAA will have something to say about this, which, of course, must trouble the outlandish patriarch of the Ball clan. Doesn\u2019t it?\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll worry about it when we get there,\u201d dad LaVar Ball told ESPN concerning whether his son will be able to play in the NCAA. \u201cWho cares? If he can\u2019t play, then he can\u2019t play. It doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019ll stop working out and getting better.\u201d\n\nAnd, thus, you have LaVar Ball in a nutshell. Since bursting onto the scene, father Ball has been nothing if not a magnet for controversy, and his attitude has been so brash that it led him to a damn WWE appearance.\n\nWhile I admire Ball\u2019s moxie and marketing strategy (since part of this villainous persona, I think, is really just grassroots marketing at its finest), I question this latest move. LaMelo, for all his high school talent, is not his brother Lonzo, the Los Angeles Lakers first-round draft pick. For all the court vision that led Lonzo to being a one-and-done college player, I think LaMelo could benefit from a couple of years in college. But that might be in jeopardy now that he\u2019s got his own signature shoe and some sort of commercial\u2014since I don\u2019t really know what this is that Slam magazine posted to Twitter:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NCAA didn\u2019t return ESPN\u2019s request for comment, probably because its officials don\u2019t even know what to say. The NCAA has never seen a beast like LaVar Ball, and let this sink in: A 16-year-old high school junior has his own shoe\u2014the MB1\u2014which became available Thursday for preorder through Big Baller Brand\u2019s website for $395, $100 less than his brother Lonzo\u2019s sneaker, which debuted at $495, ESPN reports.\n\n\n\nWhile LaMelo, who still attends Chino Hill High School in California, has already committed to UCLA, the school where his brother Lonzo played his freshman year before declaring for the NBA draft, and where his middle brother, LiAngelo \u201cGelo\u201d Ball, has just started his freshman year, ESPN notes that LaMelo is not under NCAA rules until he signs a letter of intent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMaybe in two years, they\u2019ll change the rule, and he\u2019ll be able to go to the NBA straight out of high school,\u201d LaVar Ball said.\n\n\n\nLaVar Ball added that because Gelo is already at UCLA, he can\u2019t endorse Big Baller Brand until he leaves.\n\n\u201cGelo will be next, but right now, he\u2019s handcuffed by UCLA,\u201d LaVar Ball told ESPN. \u201cHe\u2019d be ineligible if we put out a shoe with him.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLaVar Ball has already noted that all of his sons will only play a year of college ball before heading to the NBA, so he plans to put Gelo in BBB once his freshman year is done.\n\n\u201cHe won\u2019t be ineligible in April,\u201d he said of Gelo. \u201cThat\u2019s when he\u2019ll have his own shoe.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s be clear about this: If Lonzo is the Beyonc\u00e9 of this group, then LaMelo is the Kelly Rowland, and by default, Gelo is the other rotating third member whose name no one remembers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat sucks because it doesn\u2019t mean that Gelo couldn\u2019t turn out to be a decent player, but he won\u2019t be a high-round draft pick like his older brother; nor is he the anomaly his younger brother is.\n\nHe\u2019s a solid basketball player who won\u2019t wow you over with anything fantastic, but he does the little things, like rebound and make solid decisions well. His father will be hurting his career by taking him out of college early, but he will learn that the hard way.\n\nLaVar Ball knows what\u2019s best for his family. He\u2019s already done a good job of getting them this far, and when Jay-Z is buying your shoes and talking about your hustle, then maybe you\u2019re doing something right.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot to mention, father Ball reportedly turned down an offer from NBC for his family to star in a reality show in order to have the 10-episode weekly series, Ball in the Family, debut on Facebook.\n\n\u201cWe had an offer from NBC, but we turned it down,\u201d Ball told ESPN. \u201cWho\u2019s watching TV these days?

The portraits, by Kehinde Wiley and Amy Sherald respectively\u2014both black painters\u2014are such sharp departures from any previous depictions of a president and first lady that reviews were understandably mixed, even among our own crew here at The Root (including yours truly).\n\nEspecially in considering Michelle Obama\u2019s portrait, it took a moment to reconcile her portrayal with our expectations. Where was the warmth we\u2019d become so accustomed to during the Obama era? The radiant smile? The glorious brown skin?\n\nWhile Wiley\u2019s portrait of our 44th president\u2019s portrait seemed lush and even playful\u2014if whimsically unconventional for a leader of the free world\u2014Sherald\u2019s portrait of his wife, posed similarly to Rodin\u2019s The Thinker, seemed to almost recede by comparison, like a cherished photograph that had already faded much too soon for our comfort. To some of us, it seemed more like a suggestion of our favorite first lady, rather than a portrait of the lady herself.\n\nAnd yet, in the days since\u2014for this writer, at least\u2014it has been difficult not to return to look at it again and again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Doreen St. Felix wrote in a wonderful analysis for the New Yorker:\n\nThe racializing schema of Sherald\u2019s work is to \u201cexclude the idea of color as race,\u201d she has said, in her artist\u2019s statement. To Sherald, the photorealistic depiction of race\u2014a quality determined by others\u2019 eyes, externally\u2014is a dead end. Applied to Michelle Obama, the lack of brown in the skin feels first like a loss, and then like a real gain. This is a different Michelle, a woman evacuated of celebrity, who appears provisionally dreamlike, nearly a shadow. The mouth and the eyes and the strong arms that we know are present, but fainter. From some distance, I can imagine, the figure might not be immediately recognizable.\n\nOf the many things that have been written about Michelle Obama\u2019s portrait since its unveiling just over a week ago, several articles have focused on the dress she chose to be immortalized in, one made by American (semi-)affordable luxury label Milly, designed by Michelle Smith. Indeed, it is the most visually striking element of the portrait, featuring graphic-patterned patches in black, red, yellow, pink and beige, scattered across the white foreground of the skirt. It drapes across Obama\u2019s lap in much the same way I remember quilts draping across my Mississippian great-grandmother\u2019s lap decades ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany have been quick to make the same comparison, especially noting similarities between Obama\u2019s dress and the famously graphic geometric quilts created for over a century in Gee\u2019s Bend, Ala. At the unveiling, artist Amy Sherald spoke to the similarities herself, saying:\n\nThe dress chosen for this painting was designed by Milly. It has an abstract pattern that reminded me of the Dutch artist Piet Mondrian\u2019s geometric paintings. But Milly\u2019s design also resembles the inspired quilt masterpieces made by the women of Gee\u2019s Bend, a small remote black community in Alabama where they compose quilts in geometries that transform clothes and fabric remnants into masterpieces.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut designer Smith apparently had no such correlation in mind when she created the print. She spoke to Vogue about the dress, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s made of a stretch cotton poplin print in a clean, minimal, geometric print without a reference to anything past or nostalgic, which gives the dress a very forward-thinking sensibility\u2014this is very Michelle Obama.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut while Smith may not have read a metaphor for quilting in her own work, is it safe for her to assume that a woman as aware and astute as Michelle Obama\u2014well known for her strategic sartorial statements\u2014didn\u2019t? Aside from evoking the great Southern tradition of quilting\u2014as well as the Stars and Stripes famously hand-sewn for this country\u2014is it so outlandish to consider that her gown might also evoke the racial patchwork that makes up the country her husband so recently led?\n\nTo glean more insight, The Glow Up spoke with textile artist, clothing designer, children\u2019s book author and illustrator, and master quilter Cozbi Cabrera, a 2017 Lincoln Center artist-in-residence whose own quilts have been shown at the Myrtle Beach Art Museum, concurrent with an exhibit on the quilters of Gee\u2019s Bend. Like many others, she isn\u2019t so quick to discredit the correlation between the white American designer dress and the black American South:\n\nWell, I think for starters that designers have to be aware that they are influenced greatly, and that fashion overall is derivative. So, whether we are doing it consciously or subconsciously, there is something about putting all of these elements together that\u2019s going to strike a chord or trigger a memory or something. So, I think that she\u2019s probably not being\u2014I wouldn\u2019t even use the word \u201ctruthful\u201d\u2014I think that she\u2019s probably not being aware of this idea that fashion is derivative. So, it comes from somewhere. And I think that rightfully so, [Amy Sherald\u2019s] notion of her choice is very telling as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCabrera is also quick to note the very \u201cAmerican story\u201d of Gee\u2019s Bend, an isolated peninsula about 35 miles southwest of Selma, Ala., with a population of less than 300, according to the 2010 census. In 1965, Martin Luther King Jr. visited the enclave\u2014primarily African American and reachable almost exclusively by ferry\u2014three weeks before Selma\u2019s \u201cBloody Sunday\u201d to encourage voter registration. However, three years before, Alabama\u2019s government had shut down ferry service to nearby Camden, further isolating the community from basic necessities like medical attention, employment and participation in the democratic process.\n\nAnd yet, even in isolation, their traditions continued. In 2002, the Whitney Museum in New York City mounted a show of the quilts of Gee\u2019s Bend, to rave reviews. The New York Times\u2019 art critic called them \u201ceye-poppingly gorgeous,\u201d while others marveled at the fact that these modernist creations could have generated within a place seemingly cut off from inspiration, as Cabrera notes:\n\n[T]heir quilts showed up at the Whitney Museum in New York, and the reviews came back that what they were doing rivaled anything that you\u2019d find in 20th-century art. ... how could it be? How could they have these sophisticated influences if they were in isolation? And it\u2019s almost like an assumption that the Creator\u2014or what I would call the Divine\u2014sort of sprinkles sophistication and aesthetic instincts only on a particular group of people, in only a particular geographic location, you know?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimilarly, Cabrera believes it may be shortsighted to underestimate the deep significance and skill in Sherald\u2019s portrait of Michelle Obama\u2014or to assume the former first lady\u2019s intentions in choosing her for the commission. Because, ultimately, isn\u2019t art\u2014like beauty\u2014in the eye of the beholder? Said Cabrera:\n\nI think that in a less masterful hand, most people have a tendency to kind of throw in the kitchen sink, and in my mind, [Sherald] made some very deliberate choices as to what to leave out, and what was left was the likeness of Michelle Obama. So we got that it was her\u2014you know it was quite a bit of fluidity of line, and then these elements of patch. All that\u2019s left in my mind visually were the essentials to kind of like, tell the story. How [Milly designer Michelle Smith] might feel about that, I think it\u2019s almost not even relevant because I think that the larger community got what was being communicated. And so, I think that\u2019s why you keep hearing, again and again, this notion of [the] quilt. I think that there\u2019s a language that we all understand, and that\u2019s what you get with people groups; like the things that don\u2019t have to be spoken but are understood. ... It\u2019s not uncanny that the community is saying similar things along a similar vein, because we do have this common understanding.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd for those of us who, at first glance, might have wanted something more colorful and dramatic for our first black first lady, perhaps it\u2019s worth taking a beat, and considering who Michelle Obama really is, as Cabrera\u2019s deft analysis reminds us: \u201cTo me, it\u2019s the visual equivalent of a stage whisper, which draws more attention to itself.\u201d", "keywords": ["gees", "included", "dress", "obama", "lady", "black", "portrait", "think", "bend", "michelle", "picture", "quilts"], "polarity": 0.14501168400422132, "subjectivity": 0.4232492838836122},

The father of three extremely talented basketball players, including the newly drafted Los Angeles Lakers guard Lonzo Ball, recently made a guest appearance on WWE\u2019s Monday Night Raw.\n\nThe eldest Ball has molded himself from overly concerned father into a businessman and, in the process, has become a loudmouth villain, which actually seems perfect for the WWE\u2014except that he took his shirt off. And that\u2019s when LaVar Ball\u2019s shooting star to infamy came crashing back down to earth.\n\n\n\nWith sons Lonzo and LeMelo looking on, LaVar Ball got into a weird conversation with former Real World house guest-turned-WWE Intercontinental star the Miz. At one point, Ball tells his son LeMelo to handle this \u201clightweight\u201d (referring to the Miz), to which the Miz replies, \u201cAre you going to unleash all the Balls on me?\u201d\n\nLaVar Ball then walks over to the ropes and starts hopping up and down.

I want you to prove it,\u201d the Miz says.\n\n\u201cBoy, you better stay in your lane,\u201d Ball responds.

Two months later, on New Year\u2019s Eve, Donald Trump Jr. was born. LaBelle\u2019s eponymous debut was released to critical acclaim; the spawn of that Sith Lord sitting in the White House, hollering at cable news all the time\u2014eh, not so much.\n\nThe two creations do have one thing in common, though: They\u2019re both much closer to AARP-magazine subscriptions than they are to Sesame Street\u2019s key demo.\n\nNeedless to say, it was frustrating as hell to hear y\u2019all\u2019s president say, while speaking to reporters on board Air Force One, \u201cDon is, as many of you know, Don; he\u2019s a good boy. He\u2019s a good kid.\u201d\n\nOf course, to a parent, a child, no matter his or her age, is always going to be viewed a certain way. In theory, a dad rushing to defend his son is sweet. However, when I learned that Sweet Potato Saddam referred to Sweet Potato Saddam Jr. as a \u201cgood boy\u201d and a \u201cgood kid,\u201d all I could hear was Michael Evans from Good Times saying, \u201c\u2018Boy\u2019 is a white racist word.\u201d\n\n\n\nFor black men, to be called \u201cboy\u201d is nothing less than an attempt to demean us by stripping us of our manhood and making us feel smaller by comparison. Just ask boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr., who was told, \u201cDance, boy,\u201d by the very Irish Conor McGregor during their deplorable press tour. In the case of Trump Jr., it\u2019s an obvious ploy by his father to project innocence and naivete as a means of absolving a son who has opened himself up to potentially serious legal drama. To wit, a friend of Jr. reportedly told the Washington Post, \u201cThe kid is an honest kid.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis \u201ckid\u201d has multiple kids and is old enough to remember Atari. I only know what an Atari is because of an older sibling and Throwback Thursday on Instagram. Even so, I\u2019m not a boy anymore, either. Meanwhile, actual black children are never afforded the luxury of being just kids. There have been various studies conducted through the years showing that black girls and black boys are viewed as older and less innocent than their white counterparts.\n\nAnd yet a 39-year-old man is a \u201ckid\u201d after his hand was caught in the Kremlin grab bag of collusion. No black person is surprised by this line of defense, but there is something so frustrating about it given that Trump Jr. so clearly wants to be taken seriously. He not only wants to impress his father but also very much wants to be his own man.\n\n\n\nDonald Trump Jr. is the same person who has floated the idea of running for mayor of New York City or governor of New York. \u201cThe politics bug bit me,\u201d he claimed last year. More recently he told the Associated Press that he would, in fact, not be running (because he would surely lose). \u201cMaybe someday,\u201d Lil\u2019 Minute Maid Mao II said. \u201cIt\u2019s not something I\u2019m doing now. But you never know; it\u2019s fascinating stuff.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, clearly he is interested in politics and, depending on what a certain special prosecutor eventually concludes, perhaps too serious. In the meantime, Republicans will continue to cover for him and make up as many lies in his defense as possible.\n\nThis weekend, the Daily Beast\u2019s Betsy Woodruff reported on an email blast that the Republican National Committee\u2019s communications team sends out \u201cto friendly TV and radio commentators\u201d to provide new talking points in defense of Trump Jr.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of those talking points included the following claims:\n\nDon Jr. has been transparent about the logistics and substance of the meeting. He has released emails pertaining to the matter without being asked, and he has stated that he will happily cooperate with Congressional Committees should they need to investigate the matter further.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t make an ounce of sense. He has not been transparent about the logistics and substance of the meeting. He only released the emails because the New York Times had already planned to. He will \u201chappily cooperate\u201d with congressional committees because they were going to very likely make good use of their subpoena power.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNevertheless, I\u2019d rather deal with a big-ass lie than wrestle with the notion that a man who is mere months away from 40 is just some precocious youth who got carried away over an email that directly states that a hostile foreign power wants to help elect his daddy. Speaking of that terrible monster, last fall Melania Trump employed this same line of defense to address her husband\u2019s boast of grabbing women by their pussies, telling CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper, \u201cThey were kind of a boy talk, and he was [led] on, like, egg[ed] on, by the host to say dirty and bad stuff.\u201d\n\nShe compared the exchange between her husband and Billy Bush to that between \u201ctwo teenage boys\u201d before adding, \u201cThey should behave better, right?\u201d\n\nWhatever comes next remains unseen, but in the interim, one thing is for certain: Donald Trump Jr. is exactly like the man he\u2019s named after. He is confident in his ignorance; he is smug and condescending; he is constantly huffing and puffing on social media, berating people at every turn in false showings of toughness; and he thinks he can get away with anything.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut just like Daddy Orange, whenever caught in scandal, he spews lie after lie while cowering under others who speak on his behalf and whose best offense is some pathetic little cry that we ought to leave him alone because he was just kidding around.\n\n", "keywords": ["solo", "good", "kid", "album", "patti", "black", "trump", "old", "beloved", "boy", "jr", "wants", "defense", "labelles", "york", "donald", "released"], "polarity": 0.11151847327589902, "subjectivity": 0.493974040261169},

First, of course, is the fact that he's the very involved Black dad of three star athletes, which contradicts both a stereotype about Black men and a stereotype about Black athletes. He's challenging the major shoe companies; choosing to create and promote his own family's brand instead of pushing his son to sign a standard sponsorship deal. He possesses the type of outspokenness and brashness and bombast that certain types of people often mistake for savvy and sagacity. (Because, they believe, if he's talking so loudly, he must know what he's talking about.) He's an extremely large man, both in person and presence. The type who doesn't just fill out the rooms he enters. He consumes them. And he's unafraid to tell White people about themselves. And by \"White people\" I mean \"White women who work for Fox and the low-hanging punching bag filled with strip club buffet guacamole called 'Jason Whitlock.\"\n\nCombined, these characteristics create a profile of the perfect iconoclast; someone particularly equipped to disrupt the unseemly relationship between (mostly Black) athletes and the entities \u2014 the NCAA, the shoe companies, and the NBA and NFL specifically \u2014 taking advantage of their labor. Rooting for him \u2014 this big and bad-ass Black father \u2014 to succeed isn't just easy, it's practically mandated. The idea of him and what he's doing is so seductive, and feels so right, that it even compels (some of) us to attribute his boasts about beating Michael Jordan and Lebron and Steph Curry to some sort of marketing wizardry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nComplicating things, however, is LaVar Ball himself. And the fact that he's a piece of shit.\n\nThe most notable characteristic about shit is that, well, it stinks. Some shit stinks worse than others, but even the sweetest smelling shit still smells like shit. The smell is so pungent and the content so toxic that we created labyrinthic plumbing systems specifically devised to get expelled shit out of our homes as quickly as possible. And when something's odor is that aggressive, there's not much to be done to mask it. If you dropped a gallon of Febreeze on a single log of shit sitting on a carpet, it would just smell like someone dropped a gallon of Febreeze on a log of shit.\n\nThe aintshitness of LaVar Ball has been perceptible since he's been a public figure. Some of us have ignored it, of course, because of what we believe he stands for. And some of us are so desperate to see someone stick it to the man and tell White people about themselves that it could literally be a bucket of shit doing it and we'd still say \"That three gallon bucket of shit has a great point!\" And, well, there are some people who don't see anything wrong at all about what Ball is doing. Because just how game recognizes game, pieces of shit recognize other pieces of shit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt became harder to ignore two months ago, when USA Today published a feature on the Chino Hills high school basketball team Ball's two youngest sons attend. In it, Ball was revealed to be the worst type of sports parent \u2014 a bully who sabotaged the team's season with his toxicity. The stench came through again when on Fox Sports last week. Regardless of how you feel about Whitlock and Kristine Leahy, that shit just wasn't cool.\n\nAnd then, last week the shit peaked with a back-and-forth with Cleveland Cavaliers point guard Kyrie Irving. It began when Irving appeared as a guest on Uninterrupted's \"Road Trippin'\" podcast, and spoke on LaVar and Lonzo.\n\n\n\n\"I\u2019m sorry, LaVar, you\u2019re not going to be in every hotel room that Lonzo is going to be in. You\u2019re not going to be everywhere and part of his life as he continues to grow up. You got to let go. He\u2019s 19-years old. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I don\u2019t want it to bypass him being a father, but he\u2019s got to let Lonzo be Lonzo for the long haul.\" \"I had to have a talk with my dad, and I was just like, 'Man, Dad, I love you, but I\u2019m going to make my own decisions. And he told me, when I turn 18, I\u2019m responsible enough for myself to make my own decisions, and he\u2019s going to be there to help along the way. But when I turned 18, like, I got my first tattoo. I got my ear pierced. I just started doing my own thing.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKyrie, who has walked the path that Lonzo will soon be on \u2014 and also has a dad who's very involved with his life \u2014 offers practical and considerate advice. There's nothing here even remotely shady.\n\nA few days later, while on Fox's Undisputed, LaVar responded.\n\n\n\n\"Maybe he don't have the relationship that me and Zo got. And I don't think he did. First of all, your mom wasn't there, so something's got to change right there. It's not the same. Lonzo can come home and see his mom and dad all the time. We've been together.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLaVar is right. Kyrie's mom wasn't there. Because she died of Sepsis Syndrome when he was four.\n\nThis is something most people who follow the league know. In fact, her name (Elizabeth) is inscribed on each of Kyrie's signature shoes. And LaVar used this as a comeback. Essentially, in response to Kyrie saying \"What you're doing is cool, but maybe you need to fall back a bit\" Lavar basically said \"That's why your momma's dead.\"\n\nThink about how much of a piece of shit someone has to be to do that. A dead momma comeback is bad enough as a response to an insult. This was just him responding to a practical and sober piece of advice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI'm not going to call for any type of boycott of his shoes or muzzle of his platform. He can do and say whatever the hell he wants. And, if the idea of what he's doing is important enough to you to ignore who he actually is, fine. Buy his shoes, watch his interviews, and defend him on the internet and in the barbershop. Just know that you're supporting a piece of shit.

Let me leak the fucking thing and see if I can cock-block these people the way I cock-blocked Scaramucci for six months.\u2019\u201d (Priebus did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nI wouldn\u2019t say I liked Scaramucci, but I did find him entertaining. He also seemed like someone that, too, enjoys Deion Sanders\u2019 underappreciated bop, \u201cMust Be the Money.\u201d (Beyonc\u00e9 likes it, too.)\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy favorite part of the New Yorker interview:\n\nScaramucci also told me that, unlike other senior officials, he had no interest in media attention. \u201cI\u2019m not Steve Bannon, I\u2019m not trying to suck my own cock,\u201d he said, speaking of Trump\u2019s chief strategist. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to build my own brand off the fucking strength of the President. I\u2019m here to serve the country.\u201d (Bannon declined to comment.)\n\nSteve Bannon doesn\u2019t appear to be that limber, but I believe Scaramucci. Not long after this interview ran, chief of staff Reince Priebus resigned, only to be replaced by John Kelly, who immediately decided to fire Scaramucci over the New Yorker interview. That\u2019s what they\u2019re saying, anyway.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe can say the choice to can Scaramucci was rooted in the vulgarity displayed in this now iconic interview, but it likely has more to do with Scaramucci getting too much attention. Lord knows 45 is more like Diana Ross and the Supremes than Destiny\u2019s Child after LeToya Luckett and LaTavia Roberson left and the group made sure every single member got a solo on her songs.\n\nNo. 45 is the only soloist, and all his doo-wop pop pop chicks best not get too loud on the mic. Look what happened to the Mooch: He got too loud and was promptly escorted off the White House premises.\n\n\n\nWhile all of this is happening, we find out that Scaramucci\u2019s wife, Deidre Scaramucci, filed for divorce while she was nine months pregnant. A source told Page Six, \u201cWhen [the baby] James was born, he sent her a text saying, \u2018Congratulations, I\u2019ll pray for our child.\u2019\u201d This same source added, \u201cShe\u2019s mad. They aren\u2019t really speaking right now. The [pain] runs deep. [Anthony] tells her she\u2019s not that smart, that he\u2019s out of her league.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo while Scaramucci was out here praising 45 as if he\u2019d nursed him at birth, he put down his pregnant wife while berating his new co-workers. Now he is single, sold his company for naught and has bragging rights as the shortest-serving incoming White House communications director in U.S. history.\n\nThere have been a few saying they feel bad for Scaramucci. Why? He\u2019s a soulless person who forfeited his beliefs, his marriage and his business in order to attain power. His pursuits led him to bend the knee to a con man who behaved exactly as expected.\n\n\n\nCongratulations, fool. You got exactly what you deserved.\n\n\n\nSean Spicer\n\nThat leads me to now-former White House press secretary and communications director Sean Spicer, who resigned in protest over Scaramucci\u2019s hiring. There are some folks asking whether Spicer will rescind his resignation in light of Scaramucci\u2019s dismissal. Lyin\u2019 Spice knows that when you start singing freedom\u2019s song, you don\u2019t suddenly turn mute.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019d rather not see the likes of Spicer on Dancing With the Stars, but him dancing off the beat in a poorly fitting suit sounds a lot less humiliating than continuing to watch Lyin\u2019 Spice go on national television and yell at the press for not believing lies we all know even he doesn\u2019t believe. But if Spicer did take the job, that means Kellyanne Conway would seek a similar slot on a future season, so never mind. I\u2019m not sure what Spicer does next, but he would best serve what\u2019s left of his sanity if he left the White House while he still can.\n\n\n\nSpicer used to be an annoying Republican who toed the party line on the Sunday news shows like every other political hack. Maybe he even believed some of the nonsense he used to spew on TV, but as press secretary, he treated the truth as if it were the finest brand of toilet paper he had ever known, and all he got in return was his boss telling him he looked bad in his suits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe man got so stressed about daily briefings that he turned the cameras off to avoid further roasting from 45. The man made Spicer\u2019s job a living hell, but what\u2019s truly something is that Spicer resigned over Scaramucci\u2019s hiring and ended up being right about him, yet both of them are on the outs. Insert laugh track.\n\n\n\nFarewall, Lyin\u2019 Spice. You got what you deserved, too.\n\nReince Priebus\n\nAnd then there is former chief of staff Reince Priebus, who, even after his humiliation, continues to whisper sweet nothings about that orange bag of stupid.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom The Atlantic\u2019s \u201cThe Final Humiliation of Reince Priebus\u201d:\n\nBut the White House is mired in chaos, and all that Republican power has yet to result in a single major policy achievement. Priebus\u2019s critics view him as the man who sold his party out to Donald Trump. Was it really worth it, I asked? \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely worth it,\u201d Priebus said, pointing to the appointment of a conservative Supreme Court justice, regulatory reform, and a healthy economy, though he acknowledged health care remained \u201can obstacle.\u201d \u201cThe president has accomplished an incredible amount of things in the last six months,\u201d he added. \u201cThe future can be great, and the past has been pretty good.\u201d Even in exile, he was still committed to spinning the Trump line.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat\u2019s the political equivalent of \u201cdick too bomb\u201d? That\u2019s Priebus in this interview. I thought about saying more about Priebus, but if 45 decided to treat him like a \u201cnon-motherfucking-factor bitch\u201d for six months, why rock the boat (work the middle)? Next.\n\nJohn Kelly\n\nInitially, I was a little fearful of a retired general taking the reins of this White House as chief of staff. After all, the only bright side of this ongoing shit show is that as evil and vile as their political ideologies are, they\u2019ve yet to bring as much havoc to the masses because they\u2019re so bad at governing. In theory, the discipline of a military man might whip these suckers into shape. However, 45 is not going to change.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSaddle Tan Nixon is going to continue being the same messy bitch who lives for drama that he\u2019s always been. As fate would have it, on the new chief of staff\u2019s day one of duty, the Washington Post reported that it was 45 who dictated his son\u2019s misleading statement about his meeting with the Russian lawyer last year.\n\nSo the characters on The Real Housewives of White Supremacy may change, but 45 is still the NeNe Leakes of the bunch, which means that it won\u2019t be long now before Kelly finds the nearest exit or is told that his services are no longer needed. It\u2019s also just as likely that Boy Wonder Kushner and the Favorite Trump Child will bypass Kelly\u2019s authority every chance they get to offer 45 either bad advice or advice like, \u201cDon\u2019t ban trans soldiers, Daddy,\u201d that\u2019ll only get ignored.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso: Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Steve Bannon\n\nIf I were current press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, I\u2019d soon be worried about my sweaters, which are always wrinkled on television, or something else superficial. I wouldn\u2019t be shocked if 45 decided to eventually treat her the way her brother did that family pet of theirs (since she wants to talk about morality). She may be confidently condescending when speaking to reports, but all she does is stand there and essentially say, \u201cI haven\u2019t talked to the president about that.\u201d That\u2019s going to get old fast for 45, who prefers his lies with remixes (real remixes like you heard in the 1990s, not the bullshit these children get now).\n\n\n\nLastly, if I were chief strategist Steve Bannon, I wouldn\u2019t get too comfortable sitting in my chair (and, I don\u2019t know, sucking my own cock?). Yes, you\u2019re the key to his base, Grand Wizard, but haven\u2019t you already been threatened with firing before? No. 45 gon\u2019 get rid of you in due time, too. He\u2019ll just snuggle next to Sinclair Broadcasting soon after.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the meantime, I will keep laughing at all of them because it\u2019s the only way to deal with the reality that we\u2019re having to suffer with this incredibly terrible American remake of King Ralph solely because white folks wanted to feel good about being white again. #MAGA.\n\n", "keywords": ["white", "im", "president", "supremacy", "scaramucci", "real", "chief", "yalls", "housewives", "turned", "45", "scaramuccis", "priebus", "house", "man", "spicer"], "polarity": 0.05056435958221671, "subjectivity": 0.4611590393733249},

It was a status due to a combination of the reputation I already earned from playing with the Homewood YMCA in the Ammons League on the Hill and from my exploits during recess and gym class. Unfortunately, none of this impressed Mr. Simons, Sterrett's basketball coach, who wasn't going to allow me to try out for the team because I submitted the mandatory physical and doctor's waivers three days late. (To his credit, he hadn't seen me play yet, and undoubtedly would have been more lenient if he had. Still, this was an unnecessarily harsh standard. He was being a dick just for dick's sake. Also, he looked like Alf, which is relevant because he looked like Alf.)\n\nI went home and told my dad. He shook his head, said \"ok,\" and continued reading the Post-Gazette. The next day, he showed up to the school during lunch time, pulled me out of the cafeteria, and requested a meeting with Mr. Simons (who was also the 7th grade social studies teacher). We met in the gym.\n\nCalmly, my dad apologized for the lateness of the physical, and requested that Simons allow me to try out. He appreciated the apology, but said something about the rule being the rule, and denied the request. My dad had another idea:\n\n\"How about this? You play my son one-on-one right now. If he beats you \u2014 and he will \u2014 he's allowed to try out. If not, you'll never hear from me again.\"\n\nThe Alf-ish Simons turned beet red and started to stammer.\n\n\"Sir, that's not really necessary.\"\n\nMy dad was steadfast.\n\n\"Oh, yes it is.\"\n\nSensing that this was a no-win situation \u2014 and also likely intuiting that if my dad was this confident about my abilities, a bending of the rule would be worth it \u2014 he relented. By the end of the day I was on the team. I didn't even have to try out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeveral months later, while I was playing in a spring AAU tournament at Reizenstein Middle School, my dad noticed a team with preternaturally skilled and disciplined 11-year-olds running through a bevy of complex, college-level plays and zone presses. He learned that these kids were from St. Barts, and that they played a Diocese schedule during the season and an AAU schedule in the spring and summer that had them playing up to 100 meaningful games a year.\n\nLater that week, he convinced my mom that they should A) take me out of Sterrett and enroll me into St. Barts the following school year and B) allow me to repeat 6th grade because I was young for my grade (since my birthday falls a day before New Years\u2019 Eve, I was always the youngest person in every class I was in) and repeating the year would give me an advantage athletically and socially.\n\nI have countless stories like this about my dad. The 200 shots a day we'd take at on the courts behind Peabody High School the summer of '89 to upgrade my shot from a slow-release, 10-year-old appropriate set shot, to a full jumpshot released over my head and at the peak of my jump. The basketball magazines and almanacs he'd buy me when I professed at interest in devouring as much about the game and its history as I could. The mornings I'd watch him play in the Sunday Morning Warriors basketball league at the Y, where I'd sneak on the court at halftime to shoot foul shots.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven today, his Facebook page is home to dozens of snapshots of those moments. Usually me receiving some award from some camp or league or game, and him behind the lens, making sure my trophy was facing the camera.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd, of course, sometimes it would just be us.\n\nIt is difficult not to see some of my dad in LaVar Ball, the polarizing father of basketball phenoms Lonzo Ball (a projected top-three NBA draft pick), LiAngelo Ball (a high school senior committed to play at UCLA), and LaMelo Ball (a 10th grader who might already be the most popular athlete in high school sports). And not just my dad, but the countless other Black basketball dads found on bleachers at AAU tournaments and modeling perfect triple threat stances on concrete blacktops in the hood. Shepherding their sons (and sometimes daughters) from court to court and neighborhood to neighborhood. And, if they're good enough, from city to city, state to state, and school to school. Simultaneously serving as their kid's drill master, coach, instructor, one-on-one opponent, hype man, financier, adviser, protector, bouncer, dietitian, jitney, critic, visionboard, sponsor, and parent. Willing to challenge each and every entity, real or imagined, standing between them and their ultimate goal. Which could be a college scholarship. Or an NBA contract. Sometimes, they're the only other Black face in the gym (or the league) besides their kid on the court; their presence ensuring that \"these White people\" don't try any mess with their boy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know that if you sat Lonzo, LiAngelo, and LaMelo down, they'd each have stories about their dad that would mirror mine. And if you glanced through their social media accounts and family photo albums, they'd each have just as many pictures and videos either taken by their dad or with them posing next to him. And I have no doubt they treasure those pics and those memories and those moments as much as I do.\n\nThis context both constructs and complicates my feelings about LaVar Ball. Like my dad and the countless other Black basketball dads out there, he wants whats best for his sons. This is undeniable. My dad's goal was for me to receive a college basketball scholarship. And I did. Mission accomplished. LaVar Ball's sons are each better basketball players than I was, and his athletic goals for them are understandably and appropriately greater.\n\nAlso, I'd be remiss if I didn't admit to the strain of schadenfreude I experience when a Black person challenges and perhaps even upsets the status quo the way LaVar Ball currently is attempting to. I'm compelled to root for him even if I don't agree with his methods (I don't) or even like him very much (I also don't).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, those years in those gyms and those courts and on those teams and in those leagues also taught me how to recognize a blowhard and a bully. Which is exactly what LaVar Ball is. And my distaste and disdain for men like him equals the affinity I have for the Black basketball dad. I knew men like him, and they are the worst coaches to play for, the worst parents to sit in the stands with, and they very often produce the worst kids to play with and root for. You do not want to be a kid on the same team as the kid of that type of dad. Even if the team is good, they and their parents can be so insufferable and make the team so joyless that you'd rather quit it than win with it.\n\nEven his attempts to promote his family's brand are met with similar ambivalence. He's not actually wrong to attempt to get in front of the major shoe companies and pursue a lucrative partnership instead of a run-of-the-mill shoe contract. But his Big Baller Brand is GeoCities-level terrible; the only thing worse than the name is the logo, which looks like an actual belt buckle sold at Buckle. Also, while Lonzo is a phenom, he's not the type of transcendent, Lebron-ish talent who could carry a brand by himself. He's good, but not that good.\n\nCombined, this collection of conflicting feelings has left me not knowing how to feel about him. I appreciate what he's done for his kids, and I get what he's trying to do, but I don't fuck with dude at all. I want him to succeed, in theory, but I don't want him to be him. And while it's true that his diligence has helped each of his boys reach this level of prominence \u2014 and receive full athletic scholarships \u2014 his efforts and actions now are more than likely hurting them. Lonzo Ball has already been publicly rebuked by each of the major shoe companies; an act which, when considering the abject terribleness of the just released Big Baller Brand shoes, might cost them tens of millions of dollars. And I'm certain De'Aaron Fox isn't going to be the last guard to put a little extra effort into washing Lonzo on the court just because of his dad's bombast.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA month or so ago, I asked my dad how he felt about LaVar Ball. Knowing that he shares my feelings for blowhards and bullies, his answer (\"He needs to sit down and shut up\") was predictable. I then reminded him of parents like Earl Woods and Richard Williams, who each faced similar criticisms when they first become national figures, but (obviously) were proven to be right. I also reminded him of that time he challenged Mr. Simons to play me.\n\n\"Yeah, but that was different.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"I challenged him to play you, not me.\"", "keywords": ["dads", "lavar", "feel", "team", "hes", "knowing", "dad", "black", "try", "simons", "ball", "basketball", "play", "school"], "polarity": 0.08895268933575379, "subjectivity": 0.4596487920681469},

Keep in mind that this was the first time in weeks that the White House had allowed the press briefing to be televised. I\u2019m not sure when the press became such wimps, but one reporter, Brian Karem, a correspondent for Playboy, had enough.\n\n\n\nSuckabee was pushing as proof of fake news the resignation of three CNN employees over their work on a Russia-Trump investigative piece. Now, CNN stated in announcing the resignations that the story didn\u2019t meet its journalistic standards, but there has been no proof that the story itself was false. But in any case, Karem had heard enough, and in a room full of media, he interrupted Suckabee to accuse her of making inflammatory remarks. Watch the heated exchange below:\n\nIn that moment, Karem stood up not only for CNN but for all the journalists who have been dying for someone to push back against this fake-news narrative the White House \u201ctrumpets\u201d whenever stories are written of which President Vladimir Trumpelstiltskin doesn\u2019t approve.\n\nOn Wednesday, Karem told MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe co-hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski that the confrontation was a long time coming.\n\n\u201cWe are bullied and browbeaten every day, and I pretty much have had enough of it,\u201d Karem said. \u201cThere\u2019s really only two ways to deal with a bully: turn them into your friend, [but] I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a possibility, or let them know exactly what\u2019s up, and you\u2019re not going to take the bullying anymore. We can\u2019t take the bullying anymore. It\u2019s undermining the Fourth Estate, it\u2019s undermining the First Amendment.\u201d\n\nKarem added that the president\u2019s relentless pursuit of the fake-news narrative was, at its core, an assault on democracy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe reporters I know in that room\u2014even Breitbart, those people are responsible; for the government to sit there and undermine, essentially, what is an essential checks and balances in the system, it\u2019s a bit disheartening,\u201d Karem said, Raw Story reports. \u201cIt\u2019s unnerving. I can\u2019t take it anymore, it\u2019s nuts.\u201d\n\nKarem is right. Since Russia handed Trumpelstiltskin the election, the president has bullied the media, and his tactics have proved to be effective. When it was announced that press briefings wouldn\u2019t be televised, the media did not protest the decision; instead they complied with the White House\u2019s request and bitched about it on social media.\n\n\u201cWhat it speaks to is dissolving the independent media, and that\u2019s what\u2014it\u2019s trying to co-opt the media, make us, if we don\u2019t print what they want or broadcast what they like, we\u2019re automatically fake media,\u201d Karem said on Morning Joe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKarem added that the fake-news narrative is arguably one of the only strategies the White House has, and it\u2019s been consistent.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the few strategies i\u2019ve seen from this White House, and it has been ongoing,\u201d Karem said. \u201cLook, I don\u2019t lump everybody in with that.

So, of course, when New York Fashion Week and Black Panther premiere week collided Monday night, there was a presentation inspired by Oscar winner Ruth E. Carter\u2019s costumes from the film.\n\n\n\nThe \u201cWelcome to Wakanda\u201d fashion presentation had guests lined up around West 12th Street in New York City dressed in their most regal Ankara couture to get inside Industria Studios, the fashion-centric studio space and event venue where designs from Chromat, Cushnie et Ochs, Fear of God, Ikir\u00e9 Jones, LaQuan Smith, Sophie Theallet and Tome were on display.\n\nThe immersion into Wakanda began with the walls, covered in leaves that branched out like ivy. At the entrance into the concrete jungle sat the blue Lexus LC 500 used during the film, with slashes from the Black Panther across its hood. Inside the purple-lit studio, seven stunning models posed in bespoke couture designs while standing on a moss-covered stage. Golden thrones were positioned on the stage like arrows on a compass, giving guests the hottest backdrop to flex on the \u2019gram.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Industria really transformed into Wakanda when the stars of Black Panther\u2014Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong\u2019o, Danai Gurira and Winston Duke\u2014held court on the black carpet. Mingling with guests and posing with the models inspired by their characters, the stars lit up the venue, taking laps around the stage and selfies with guests who dined on Wakanda Patties, made of chickpea and roast yam, and Cricket Tarts, made of chocolate-roasted crickets. Guests sipped signature drinks as artist and DJ Heron Preston kept the crowd\u2014and singer Elle Varner\u2014dancing till long past last call. Clearly, it\u2019s lit in Wakanda.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen the bar closed, even after the lights came up and janitors began sweeping up the floor, the crowds still didn\u2019t disperse, wanting to stay in the safe haven of black excellence just a little while longer. But with gift bags from event sponsor Redken in hand, the guests eventually shuffled off into the night, counting down the days till they can get back to the affirming space carved into existence by Black Panther.\n\n\n\nFortunately, the joy of the evening will continue on, as the seven bespoke pieces will be auctioned off by CharityBuzz to benefit the international humanitarian organization Save the Children. And the film-inspired capsule collections that were on display by shoe-and-accessories designer Brother Vellies, Black Panther jewelry and armor designer and official jeweler Douriean, and knitwear designer Josh Bennett are on sale today, Tuesday, for all the fans who want to keep the magic alive. #WakandaForever, indeed!", "keywords": ["guests", "wakanda", "panther", "black", "designer", "bnyfw", "york", "week", "stage", "welcome", "venue", "till"], "polarity": 0.10379182449494952, "subjectivity": 0.4061868686868687},

The movie, from Saban Films, stars Forest Whitaker as Archbishop Desmond Tutu.\n\nThe plot, a blend of fact and fiction, focuses on what happens after Tutu is appointed head of a nationwide investigation as part of the postapartheid Truth and Reconciliation Commission. According to the synopsis, \u201che\u2019s summoned to a maximum-security prison by a notorious murderer seeking clemency [played by Eric Bana]. Inside the brutal prison walls, Tutu is drawn into a dangerous, life-changing battle with the cunning criminal.\u201d\n\nRecently, The Root had a chance to speak with Mpho Tutu, Desmond Tutu\u2019s daughter and spokesperson.\n\nWhile neither Mpho nor Desmond Tutu himself played a role in the film getting made, Mpho was approached by the filmmakers to see if her father would give his blessing to the making of the film.\n\nDesmond Tutu stated that he understood it to be an artistic work, and as such was the work of the artist, whether or not he gave his blessing. He was grateful, however, to be asked for his blessing, Mpho says. Desmond Tutu did see the film and was really pleased with the story, his daughter says, and ultimately endorsed it as a story well told.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMpho also feels that the story was very well told.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a work that is a mixture of fact and fiction,\u201d she told The Root. \u201cThe people who are portrayed in the film are made up of many strands of South African stories. My father is recognizable as my father because he played such a pivotal role in the commission, and Mr. Whitaker portrayed him quite masterfully. I thought it was a really beautiful film and it told a really important story.\u201d\n\nBecause the tale told in The Forgiven is made up of the strands of several stories, most of the people portrayed in the film are amalgams of several people. Still, for Mpho, there are pieces of the story that are very familiar: \u201cThe Truth and Reconciliation Commission was a large part of the life of South Africa, so that piece of the story was very recognizable.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMpho also believes that the film does her father\u2019s legacy justice.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that is striking about my father\u2019s legacy is that he was able to bring the stories of courage of so many South Africans into public view. What is most potent about his legacy is that he got to be a spokesperson for so many heroes and heroines. That comes through in the film,\u201d she said.\n\nAlthough the film puts her father at the forefront, Mpho says it\u2019s important to remember that there are many people with important stories that don\u2019t get told.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAlthough my father\u2019s role in this film looms large, it soon becomes evident that the real heroes and heroines of this story are those who are often called the little people\u2014people who are so often forgotten and whose names we don\u2019t know. The people whose stories we may sometimes ignore\u2014they have a crucial lesson to teach all of us about real courage, about genuine generosity and about true forgiveness,\u201d she said.\n\nMpho hopes that many people will get a chance to view this film and allow it to touch their lives.\n\nWe here at The Root hope for the same.", "keywords": ["fathers", "film", "legacy", "told", "speaks", "role", "desmond", "means", "work", "forgiven", "mpho", "father", "tutu", "south", "root"], "polarity": 0.23137566137566137, "subjectivity": 0.5533068783068783},

Yes, you read that correctly.\n\nThe Washington Post reports that Trump made his comments after the reasons he gave for firing FBI Director James Comey during an NBC interview Thursday were directly contradicted by statements made by others in the White House, including Vice President Mike Pence, meaning that the various explanations were at best misleading and, at worst, flat out lies.\n\nTrump sent out two tweets Friday suggesting that he would cancel White House press briefings and instead hand out written statements to communicate with the public.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDifferent explanations have been given for Comey\u2019s firing, and the stories coming out of the Trump White House have changed each day since it happened. As the Post notes, this calls into question the credibility of not only press secretary Sean Spicer but also Pence, principal deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway.\n\nSpicer told reporters Friday that the president was \u201cdismayed\u201d that the focus was on the accuracy of the statements delivered by his spokesmen.\n\n\u201cThe president is an active president.

Rosenstein, but by Wednesday the word was that Trump had been considering firing Comey for a long time, and made the final determination after hearing from Sessions and Rosenstein.\n\nAll along, his spokesmen have maintained that Trump\u2019s decision had nothing to do with the ongoing Russia investigation that Comey was overseeing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring a Thursday interview with NBC\u2019s Lester Holt, Trump said that he made the decision to fire Comey on his own and that he would have done it regardless of what Rosenstein recommended, adding that he had been thinking of \u201cthis Russia thing with Trump\u201d when he came to his decision to fire Comey.\n\n\u201cIn fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said, \u2018You know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story; it\u2019s an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election th they should have won,\u201d Trump said.\n\nRead more at the Washington Post.", "keywords": ["white", "threatens", "cant", "president", "russia", "statements", "trump", "straight", "end", "press", "briefings", "comey", "house", "thing", "staff", "firing"], "polarity": 0.10148809523809524, "subjectivity": 0.4449404761904762},

Is it Eric and his constant justification of the war against all them illegal Messicans? Is it Ivanka, who has managed to be so offensive that Marshalls (whose slogan might as well be, \u201cI can\u2019t believe I spilled this on my dress; wait, there\u2019s a Marshalls on the way\u201d) dropped her product line? Is it Tiffany Trump, the Judy Winslow of the family? Or is it endangered-species-killing, history-warping Trump Jr., whose own fiancee actually thought he might be descended from retarded people (her words, not mine)?\n\nToday we have definitive proof that Trump Jr. has leaped ahead of the pack. He\u2019s become the Fredo of the family, through sheer incompetence and by engaging in an act so brazenly stupid that it transcends betrayal and rests upon the hilltop of political suicide.\n\nThis past weekend, the New York Times reached out to Trump Jr. about an upcoming exclusive story about a meeting he attended on June 9, 2016. Trump Jr. claimed that the meeting was a big nothing burger; that he, Kushner and then-Donald Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort met with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya at the request of a mutual friend to possibly discuss \u201cRussian-to-American adoption policy\u201d\u2014which is auto correct for \u201cU.S. sanctions on Russia.\u201d\n\nThen, Monday night, the Times dropped another bombshell, reporting that not only had the Russian-lawyer meeting been about sharing information gathered by Russia to harm Hillary Clinton, but the Russians also wanted to share it with the Trump campaign, and Donnie Jr. knew that before taking the meeting. Just to clarify, taking aid, either financial or material, from a foreign power during a presidential campaign is totes illegal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMind you, the Times story was from sources in the White House who claimed knowledge of the email exchanges that set up this meeting. These are sources, not proof. Fredo Trump Jr. could have simply lawyered up (which he did) and shut up (which he didn\u2019t), and the whole thing might have blown over until the next time his father tweeted something crazy. Instead, what does the namesake Trump do?\n\nHe releases the entire email chain on Twitter. The whole DAMN thing.\n\nAll.

Featuring such exchanges as:\n\nThe documents \u201cwould incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father,\u201d read the email, written by a trusted intermediary, who added, \u201cThis is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government\u2019s support for Mr. Trump.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo which Donald Trump Jr. responded minutes later:\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s what you say I love it especially later in the summer.\u201d\n\nEven independent journalist Jared Yates Sexton, whose work has appeared in the New York Times, couldn\u2019t believe it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe had never seen these emails with his own eyes; investigators had been looking for them for over a year; Fredo Trump Jr. could\u2019ve just denied the whole thing and called it #FakeNews (which is what he had been saying about Russian collusion all year). Instead he just blurts out all the damning information like he won something.\n\nFredo Jr. is the guy whose girlfriend says, \u201cI hear you\u2019ve been texting other women on your phone,\u201d and he responds by saying, \u201cWrong! I can\u2019t believe you\u2019d say that!

Jared Kushner, who lied about the meeting on security clearance forms, which is against the law? Put more pressure on Paul Manafort, who, as a campaign manager, knew full well that financial or material aid from a foreign nation is against the law? Fredo Trump Jr., for being so blisteringly incompetent? Or, even better, Donald Trump, whose tweets after this meeting, in his building, suggest that more was exchanged with the Russian lawyer than just recipes and adoption gift certificates?

These sanctions led the Kremlin to ban the adoption of Russian children by Americans at the end of 2012.\u201d\n\nPart of the information she\u2019d collected noted that a company run by a former U.S. citizen didn\u2019t pay taxes in the U.S. or Russia and may have also donated to the Democratic National Committee.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is this portion that Veselnitskaya said she believes piqued Trump Jr.\u2019s interest. In fact, she said that he asked only one question during their meeting.\n\n\u201cThe question that I was asked was as follows: whether I had any financial records which might prove that the funds used to sponsor the DNC were coming from inappropriate sources,\u201d she said, NBC News reports.\n\n\n\nVeselnitskaya claims that she never asked for a meeting with Trump Jr., and only sought to spread word on \u201cthe real circumstances behind the Magnitsky Act,\u201d NBC News reports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVeselnitskaya also added that the past few days since the initial story broke haven\u2019t been the best days of her life.\n\n\u201cImagine yourself in my shoes. One morning you wake up, and all of a sudden you are the focus of all the high-ranking, upstream media of the world,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cTo summarize, those were not the happiest days of my life, I have to say. I have to break up my holiday,\u201d she said. \u201cI have to take a trip back to Moscow, because I just wanted to be able to answer the questions myself.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at NBC News.", "keywords": ["information", "russian", "info", "clinton", "lawyer", "didnt", "wanted", "trump", "claims", "meeting", "jrs", "contradicts", "jr", "trapped", "nbc", "days", "veselnitskaya"], "polarity": -0.020731707317073172, "subjectivity": 0.34004065040650405},

When confronted with any statistic that shows widespread inequality, Fox News watchers, people who own \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d paraphernalia and even Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders supporters who \u201cdon\u2019t see color\u201d all propose the same theory:\n\nIf \u201cthe blacks\u201d concentrated on family, hard work and education, they could eliminate income disparities. America doesn\u2019t have a race problem; we have a class problem.\n\nThe New York Times reports that a new study by Harvard and Stanford economists disproves those arguments. Research from the Equality of Opportunity Project (pdf) shows that black boys raised in good neighborhoods by wealthy, two-parent families still don\u2019t have the economic potential of low-income white boys.\n\nThe research nullifies the conservative argument, placing the whitesplained dismissal of white supremacy in a category defined by a rarely used, neoclassical academic term:\n\nBullshit.\n\nFor black boys in America, upward mobility has nothing to do with education, class or work ethic. They will likely earn less money than white kids who grew up in worse neighborhoods. They will probably earn less than white boys from poorer families. They will be locked out from every access point to the American dream, and the data proves it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProfessor Ibram Kendi, director of the Antiracist Research and Policy Center at American University, told the Times, \u201cOne of the most popular liberal post-racial ideas is the idea that the fundamental problem is class and not race, and clearly this study explodes that idea.\u201d Kendi added, \u201cBut for whatever reason, we\u2019re unwilling to stare racism in the face.\u201d\n\nUsing demographics and income numbers from virtually all Americans in their 30s, the study cited in the Times takes data from the U.S. Census Bureau and \u201cde-identified longitudinal data covering nearly the entire U.S. population from 1989-2015\u201d to reach conclusions that dispel three myths about upward mobility in America.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMyth No. 1: It\u2019s not racism. It\u2019s a class issue.\n\nIt is true that Asians, Hispanics and white children all achieve upward mobility as defined by income. Black children ... not so much.\n\nFor instance, black children born in the bottom fifth of income earners have about a 2.5 percent chance of reaching the top fifth of the income bracket. White children, by contrast, have a 10.6 percent chance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven black children who grow up in high-income households fare no better. African Americans with parents in the top money-making category are as likely to fall to the bottom as they are to remain on top. White children whose parents are in the top quintile, however, are five times more likely to stay on top as they are to fall to the bottom.\n\nBlack males are still more likely to be incarcerated across every economic stratum. According to the demographic data, black men raised by millionaires are as likely to be incarcerated as white men raised by families earning $36,000 per year.\n\nMyth No. 2: Black people need to concentrate on family, education and work ethic.\n\nSome hypothesize that the disparity in standardized test scores may explain the income gap. But the study shows that black men don\u2019t have access to upward mobility even when factors such as marriage rates, educational attainment and parents\u2019 income are figured in. The research shows that the income gap exists mainly because of the low incomes of black males.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor example, there is little difference in standardized test results between black men and black women, but black men still have a substantially higher income gap than black women.\n\nYet when comparing children who grow up in two-parent homes, black men fare worse economically. When looking at the wealth of parents, black men still do worse. In fact, the only indicator in which black men seem to outpace their white counterparts is incarceration rates.\n\nMyth No. 3: It\u2019s probably because they grew up in the ghetto.\n\nOf course, poor neighborhoods don\u2019t have as many \u201cresources\u201d as wealthier neighborhoods, which might lead to income disparities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNah, b. You can\u2019t blame this one on \u201cthe hood.\u201d\n\nThe research shows that black males whose parents have the same income and grew up in the same neighborhoods as white families still suffer from higher incarceration rates and wage inequality\u2014even if they grew up on the same block.\n\nAccording to the study, white boys who grew up in the worst areas for economic mobility do better than black boys who grew up in some of the best neighborhoods. In fact, for 99 percent of the neighborhoods in the U.S., black males earn less as adults than white men who grew up in comparable neighborhoods with comparable families.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe study notes that black boys seem to benefit from moving to better neighborhoods, although not as much as white boys.\n\nBut what about black girls?\n\nThere are some who have read the Times\u2019 article and addressed the notion that the research seemed to omit data about black women:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe New York Times piece doesn\u2019t specifically address the data on black girls, but the full study does.\n\nIt notes that black women attend college at higher rates than white men and earn slightly more than white women when parental income is factored in. The study details the findings that the wage gap is much starker for black men but adds:\n\nIt is important to note, however, that this finding does not imply that the black-white gap in women\u2019s individual incomes will vanish with time. This is because black women continue to have substantially lower levels of household income than white women, both because they are less likely to be married and because black men earn less than white men (Online Appendix Figure IV). As a result, black girls grow up in lower-income households than white girls in each generation, creating a persistent racial disparity in individual income for women even in the absence of an intergenerational gap in their individual incomes. ... We therefore focus on understanding the determinants of intergenerational gaps between black and white men in the rest of the paper.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe results of the study highlight the fact that America cannot address economic inequality and the wage gap without discussing race. While it is impossible to quantify success, income disparity is key in understanding the disparities embedded in American society.\n\n\n\nWhile black America has pointed out these disparities for a long time, this study shows that even when black children begin at the same starting point as their white counterparts, they don\u2019t have equal access to the rungs on the ladder leading to the American dream.\n\nAs this research proves, addressing segregation, community resources and the education system is necessary. But there is only one thing that explains the fact that every factor of our social structure is tilted against black children:\n\nWhite supremacy.", "keywords": ["things", "white", "income", "neighborhoods", "proves", "boys", "research", "black", "grew", "study", "children", "gap", "men", "equal"], "polarity": 0.040120167189132645, "subjectivity": 0.3860135841170321},

According to the synopsis, \u201che\u2019s summoned to a maximum-security prison by a notorious murderer seeking clemency [played by Eric Bana]. Inside the brutal prison walls, Tutu is drawn into a dangerous, life-changing battle with the cunning criminal.\u201d\n\nRecently, The Root had a chance to speak with Mpho Tutu, Desmond Tutu\u2019s daughter and spokesperson.\n\nWhile neither Mpho nor Desmond Tutu himself played a role in the film getting made, Mpho was approached by the filmmakers to see if her father would give his blessing to the making of the film.\n\nDesmond Tutu stated that he understood it to be an artistic work, and as such was the work of the artist, whether or not he gave his blessing. He was grateful, however, to be asked for his blessing, Mpho says. Desmond Tutu did see the film and was really pleased with the story, his daughter says, and ultimately endorsed it as a story well told.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMpho also feels that the story was very well told.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a work that is a mixture of fact and fiction,\u201d she told The Root. \u201cThe people who are portrayed in the film are made up of many strands of South African stories. My father is recognizable as my father because he played such a pivotal role in the commission, and Mr. Whitaker portrayed him quite masterfully. I thought it was a really beautiful film and it told a really important story.\u201d\n\nBecause the tale told in The Forgiven is made up of the strands of several stories, most of the people portrayed in the film are amalgams of several people. Still, for Mpho, there are pieces of the story that are very familiar: \u201cThe Truth and Reconciliation Commission was a large part of the life of South Africa, so that piece of the story was very recognizable.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMpho also believes that the film does her father\u2019s legacy justice.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that is striking about my father\u2019s legacy is that he was able to bring the stories of courage of so many South Africans into public view. What is most potent about his legacy is that he got to be a spokesperson for so many heroes and heroines. That comes through in the film,\u201d she said.\n\nAlthough the film puts her father at the forefront, Mpho says it\u2019s important to remember that there are many people with important stories that don\u2019t get told.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAlthough my father\u2019s role in this film looms large, it soon becomes evident that the real heroes and heroines of this story are those who are often called the little people\u2014people who are so often forgotten and whose names we don\u2019t know. The people whose stories we may sometimes ignore\u2014they have a crucial lesson to teach all of us about real courage, about genuine generosity and about true forgiveness,\u201d she said.\n\nMpho hopes that many people will get a chance to view this film and allow it to touch their lives.\n\nWe here at The Root hope for the same.", "keywords": ["fathers", "film", "legacy", "told", "speaks", "role", "desmond", "means", "work", "forgiven", "mpho", "father", "tutu", "south", "root"], "polarity": 0.23137566137566137, "subjectivity": 0.5533068783068783},

To figure out the boundaries of three virtual Twitter communities \u2014 Asian Americans, African Americans, and feminists \u2014 his team pored over the hashtags used by community leaders and scraped news coverage mentioning both those groups and also containing a hashtag. Freelon then turned those terms into a cloud of affiliated hashtags that provided a rough map of the community. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe study follows up on one that Freelon co-authored in 2016. It concluded that the advent of social media has meant that the Black Lives Matter movement and other protesters have generally been \u201cable to circulate their own narratives without relying on mainstream news outlets,\u201d making more critical the need for mainstream media to staff their newsrooms with journalists whom protesters can trust if the news outlets want the story.\n\nOlivier Kamanda added for the Knight Foundation, \u201cOn March 8 Knight Foundation will host a Twitter chat at noon E.T. to answer questions about the report and connect with people around ways to strengthen the relationship between journalists and these communities.

The report calls for a commitment by political leaders to large-scale social spending at a time when the administration of President Trump and a Republican-controlled Congress are preparing for drastic cuts to programs for low-income families and individuals.\n\n\n\n\u201c \u2018Healing our Divided Society,\u2019 a report to be released Tuesday by the Eisenhower Foundation, acknowledges strides in closing the economic, social and political gaps between racial groups in America. The African American and Hispanic middle classes have grown significantly, and the United States elected and reelected a black man as president.\n\n\u201cBut since the late 1960s, the percentage of American children living in poverty has increased, income inequality and the wealth gap have widened, and segregation has crept back into schools and neighborhoods.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c \u2018Racial and ethnic inequality is still with us. It\u2019s a real problem and it is worsening,\u2019 said Fred Harris, a former senator and member of the panel that came to be known as the Kerner Commission, named for its chairman, Otto Kerner Jr., a Democrat who was then governor of Illinois. . . .\u201d\n\nJared Ball, imixwhatilike.org: Race, Rebellion, Reporting and Research: Baltimore and The Kerner Commission at 50\n\nC-SPAN: 1968: America in Turmoil TV Schedule\n\n\n\nWill Kane, UC Berkeley: Kerner@50 speakers find progress scant \u2013 and the fight against racism in peril\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKatie Pearce, Johns Hopkins University: 50 years ago, a landmark report laid bare the racial inequality fueling urban unrest across the nation\n\n\n\nAt 3:15, Farrakhan calls Jews \u2018the mother and father of apartheid, the Jews.\u201dhttps://t.co/WE5ys7It8R\u2014 Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) February 28, 2018\n\nTapper Blasts Politicians Who Meet With Farrakhan\n\n\u201cCNN\u2019s Jake Tapper was incensed when Reverend Louis Farrakhan gave a blatantly anti-Semitic speech for Saviours\u2019 Day, a national convention organized by the Nation of Islam, and it was attended by thousands, including Womens\u2019 March co-chair Tamika Mallory.

When confronted with any statistic that shows widespread inequality, Fox News watchers, people who own \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d paraphernalia and even Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders supporters who \u201cdon\u2019t see color\u201d all propose the same theory:\n\nIf \u201cthe blacks\u201d concentrated on family, hard work and education, they could eliminate income disparities. America doesn\u2019t have a race problem; we have a class problem.\n\nThe New York Times reports that a new study by Harvard and Stanford economists disproves those arguments. Research from the Equality of Opportunity Project (pdf) shows that black boys raised in good neighborhoods by wealthy, two-parent families still don\u2019t have the economic potential of low-income white boys.\n\nThe research nullifies the conservative argument, placing the whitesplained dismissal of white supremacy in a category defined by a rarely used, neoclassical academic term:\n\nBullshit.\n\nFor black boys in America, upward mobility has nothing to do with education, class or work ethic. They will likely earn less money than white kids who grew up in worse neighborhoods. They will probably earn less than white boys from poorer families. They will be locked out from every access point to the American dream, and the data proves it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProfessor Ibram Kendi, director of the Antiracist Research and Policy Center at American University, told the Times, \u201cOne of the most popular liberal post-racial ideas is the idea that the fundamental problem is class and not race, and clearly this study explodes that idea.\u201d Kendi added, \u201cBut for whatever reason, we\u2019re unwilling to stare racism in the face.\u201d\n\nUsing demographics and income numbers from virtually all Americans in their 30s, the study cited in the Times takes data from the U.S. Census Bureau and \u201cde-identified longitudinal data covering nearly the entire U.S. population from 1989-2015\u201d to reach conclusions that dispel three myths about upward mobility in America.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMyth No. 1: It\u2019s not racism. It\u2019s a class issue.\n\nIt is true that Asians, Hispanics and white children all achieve upward mobility as defined by income. Black children ... not so much.\n\nFor instance, black children born in the bottom fifth of income earners have about a 2.5 percent chance of reaching the top fifth of the income bracket. White children, by contrast, have a 10.6 percent chance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven black children who grow up in high-income households fare no better. African Americans with parents in the top money-making category are as likely to fall to the bottom as they are to remain on top. White children whose parents are in the top quintile, however, are five times more likely to stay on top as they are to fall to the bottom.\n\nBlack males are still more likely to be incarcerated across every economic stratum. According to the demographic data, black men raised by millionaires are as likely to be incarcerated as white men raised by families earning $36,000 per year.\n\nMyth No. 2: Black people need to concentrate on family, education and work ethic.\n\nSome hypothesize that the disparity in standardized test scores may explain the income gap. But the study shows that black men don\u2019t have access to upward mobility even when factors such as marriage rates, educational attainment and parents\u2019 income are figured in. The research shows that the income gap exists mainly because of the low incomes of black males.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor example, there is little difference in standardized test results between black men and black women, but black men still have a substantially higher income gap than black women.\n\nYet when comparing children who grow up in two-parent homes, black men fare worse economically. When looking at the wealth of parents, black men still do worse. In fact, the only indicator in which black men seem to outpace their white counterparts is incarceration rates.\n\nMyth No. 3: It\u2019s probably because they grew up in the ghetto.\n\nOf course, poor neighborhoods don\u2019t have as many \u201cresources\u201d as wealthier neighborhoods, which might lead to income disparities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNah, b. You can\u2019t blame this one on \u201cthe hood.\u201d\n\nThe research shows that black males whose parents have the same income and grew up in the same neighborhoods as white families still suffer from higher incarceration rates and wage inequality\u2014even if they grew up on the same block.\n\nAccording to the study, white boys who grew up in the worst areas for economic mobility do better than black boys who grew up in some of the best neighborhoods. In fact, for 99 percent of the neighborhoods in the U.S., black males earn less as adults than white men who grew up in comparable neighborhoods with comparable families.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe study notes that black boys seem to benefit from moving to better neighborhoods, although not as much as white boys.\n\nBut what about black girls?\n\nThere are some who have read the Times\u2019 article and addressed the notion that the research seemed to omit data about black women:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe New York Times piece doesn\u2019t specifically address the data on black girls, but the full study does.\n\nIt notes that black women attend college at higher rates than white men and earn slightly more than white women when parental income is factored in. The study details the findings that the wage gap is much starker for black men but adds:\n\nIt is important to note, however, that this finding does not imply that the black-white gap in women\u2019s individual incomes will vanish with time. This is because black women continue to have substantially lower levels of household income than white women, both because they are less likely to be married and because black men earn less than white men (Online Appendix Figure IV). As a result, black girls grow up in lower-income households than white girls in each generation, creating a persistent racial disparity in individual income for women even in the absence of an intergenerational gap in their individual incomes. ... We therefore focus on understanding the determinants of intergenerational gaps between black and white men in the rest of the paper.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe results of the study highlight the fact that America cannot address economic inequality and the wage gap without discussing race. While it is impossible to quantify success, income disparity is key in understanding the disparities embedded in American society.\n\n\n\nWhile black America has pointed out these disparities for a long time, this study shows that even when black children begin at the same starting point as their white counterparts, they don\u2019t have equal access to the rungs on the ladder leading to the American dream.\n\nAs this research proves, addressing segregation, community resources and the education system is necessary.

The movie, from Saban Films, stars Forest Whitaker as Archbishop Desmond Tutu.\n\nThe plot, a blend of fact and fiction, focuses on what happens after Tutu is appointed head of a nationwide investigation as part of the postapartheid Truth and Reconciliation Commission. According to the synopsis, \u201che\u2019s summoned to a maximum-security prison by a notorious murderer seeking clemency [played by Eric Bana]. Inside the brutal prison walls, Tutu is drawn into a dangerous, life-changing battle with the cunning criminal.\u201d\n\nRecently, The Root had a chance to speak with Mpho Tutu, Desmond Tutu\u2019s daughter and spokesperson.\n\nWhile neither Mpho nor Desmond Tutu himself played a role in the film getting made, Mpho was approached by the filmmakers to see if her father would give his blessing to the making of the film.\n\nDesmond Tutu stated that he understood it to be an artistic work, and as such was the work of the artist, whether or not he gave his blessing. He was grateful, however, to be asked for his blessing, Mpho says. Desmond Tutu did see the film and was really pleased with the story, his daughter says, and ultimately endorsed it as a story well told.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMpho also feels that the story was very well told.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a work that is a mixture of fact and fiction,\u201d she told The Root. \u201cThe people who are portrayed in the film are made up of many strands of South African stories. My father is recognizable as my father because he played such a pivotal role in the commission, and Mr. Whitaker portrayed him quite masterfully. I thought it was a really beautiful film and it told a really important story.\u201d\n\nBecause the tale told in The Forgiven is made up of the strands of several stories, most of the people portrayed in the film are amalgams of several people. Still, for Mpho, there are pieces of the story that are very familiar: \u201cThe Truth and Reconciliation Commission was a large part of the life of South Africa, so that piece of the story was very recognizable.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMpho also believes that the film does her father\u2019s legacy justice.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that is striking about my father\u2019s legacy is that he was able to bring the stories of courage of so many South Africans into public view. What is most potent about his legacy is that he got to be a spokesperson for so many heroes and heroines. That comes through in the film,\u201d she said.\n\nAlthough the film puts her father at the forefront, Mpho says it\u2019s important to remember that there are many people with important stories that don\u2019t get told.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAlthough my father\u2019s role in this film looms large, it soon becomes evident that the real heroes and heroines of this story are those who are often called the little people\u2014people who are so often forgotten and whose names we don\u2019t know. The people whose stories we may sometimes ignore\u2014they have a crucial lesson to teach all of us about real courage, about genuine generosity and about true forgiveness,\u201d she said.\n\nMpho hopes that many people will get a chance to view this film and allow it to touch their lives.\n\nWe here at The Root hope for the same.", "keywords": ["fathers", "film", "legacy", "told", "speaks", "role", "desmond", "means", "work", "forgiven", "mpho", "father", "tutu", "south", "root"], "polarity": 0.23137566137566137, "subjectivity": 0.5533068783068783},

Hyacinthe is one of the hardest-hustling creatives in New York City, crafting a hybrid career out of her two greatest passions: music and fashion. By day, the stylist and CEO of Immaculate Wardrobe dresses Fortune 500 female power brokers; by night, she\u2019s DJ Soda Pop, spinning hip-hop and house at Manhattan venues like the Museum of Sex\u2014where she launches a weekly residency tonight.\n\nThe Glow Up recently caught up with the busy Bronx-born beauty to discuss her parallel creative careers and her future as a fashion DJ. The product of what she describes as a traditional Haitian-American family, Hyacinthe grew up on a steady diet of hip-hop and haute couture, influenced by three older brothers and a style-obsessed stepsister. Her own obsession with fashion began so early, she recalls cutting out and stashing Vogue spreads under her pillowcase, just so she could wear the outfits in her dreams:\n\nI remember being in school\u2014we had to list our skills, what we were good at. And the only thing I [could] think of was that I can put clothes together nicely. ... And I remember picking up\u2014it was Vibe magazine\u2014and they used to have the fashion editorials, and I saw [celebrity fashion stylist] June Ambrose. And they had this article, and I remember it led with \u201cstyle architect,\u201d and I was just like, \u201cThat\u2019s what I want to do!\u201d She was a major inspiration. ... I just saw her, and I was like, \u201cThis is what I aspire to be.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUltimately, it was a mentoring program led by image activist Michaela angela Davis that would be the conduit for bringing Hyacinthe\u2019s aspirations to fruition\u2014and would teach her a powerful lesson in asking for what you want:\n\nIt all starts with Michaela; she was running something called Salon du Shine at her house, where there\u2019d be a group of, like, 10 of us girls [getting] together in her loft in Brooklyn. And we would just talk about stuff, you know. And I remember going up to Michaela, like, \u201cCan you introduce me to June Ambrose?\u201d And she was just like, \u201cI don\u2019t know ... June is super-busy.\u201d I kid you not: A couple of days later, Michaela calls me and she says, \u201cJune is looking for an intern.\u201d... So I went to the interview\u2014June\u2019s two assistants at the time, they tore me to pieces\u2014but I wound up getting the internship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile interning for Ambrose, Hyacinthe also worked full time to put herself through the Fashion Merchandising Management program at New York City\u2019s Berkeley College. It was the beginning of a career path that her Haitian parents, unfortunately, didn\u2019t understand:\n\nMy parents\u2014although they were very loving\u2014they didn\u2019t understand the concept of me wanting to be a stylist and me being in a creative field; it was foreign to them. ... They didn\u2019t have the opportunity to dream as we do, and I think because of that, they\u2019re unable to\u2014they\u2019re in a sense blind to that. ... So I wound up having to put myself through college; I worked full time [in retail] and I did this internship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWorking for Ambrose taught Hyacinthe how the editorials she once obsessed over were created, but it was working in retail that helped her find her niche: helping busy professional women build their wardrobes.\n\nI would work with clients, and they\u2019d be like, \u201cSophia, I love working with you; you style me so well. I wish you could come dress me at home.\u201d And one day I actually got the courage to say, \u201cWell, I can.\u201d ... So this one client took me up on it, and I went to her house and started with her closet. But then she had me speak with her career coach, and that\u2019s when it really clicked: This is on another level. Like, you know, female executives really need this. And I really found the value that I could add.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIdentifying her core clientele and their unique need to possess a high-end wardrobe without having the time to curate or shop for it, Hyacinthe launched her company, Immaculate Wardrobe. The self-described \u201cwardrobe whisperer\u201d currently dresses about 20 clients, all of whom are powerful women who inspire her daily, as she explained:\n\n\n\nI work primarily with female boss bitches. These are women that are working [as] CEOs of companies, and they\u2019re also moms. ... I feel like it\u2019s really important for me to surround myself with these powerful women. And I feel like since they\u2019re at the top of their companies, not only am I empowering them, but also the women that come [into their companies] that\u2019ve just graduated from college ... to see that someone at the top of their career is not only killing it, but also killing it with style.\n\nBut while helping other women fulfill their potential, Hyacinthe also realized an opportunity to further fulfill her own. A longtime avid lover of music, she was often critical of DJs on the New York City nightclub scene. Challenged by an exasperated friend to learn for herself, she accepted his gift of a DJ class at New York\u2019s famed Rock & Soul record store. Instantly, another passion was born, along with an alter ego: DJ Soda Pop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike her styling career, Hyacinthe\u2019s growth as a DJ has been simultaneously organic and self-driven. She initially asked more-established DJs for opening slots and cultivated her own contacts and connections. It\u2019s a path that called into conflict the hip-hop-loving girl from New York\u2019s Bronx borough and the cultured style expert whom elite businesswomen entrust with their wardrobes:\n\n\n\nGrowing up in my family, I grew up listening to Reasonable Doubt, to Onyx, to Nas\u2014like, really hard music. Like, I\u2019m very feminine and girly now, but I grew up liking really hard-core rap. I\u2019ve always known that I\u2019ve had this love and passion for music, but it was, \u201cOK, Sophia, either you can pursue fashion styling or you can be a DJ.\u201d I didn\u2019t think in my mind\u2014I couldn\u2019t fathom the idea of me flourishing in both fields ... [But] to be honest with you, I can\u2019t exist with one without the other. ... I feel like they feed into each other so much, especially the route that I want to go. ... I want to be New York\u2019s new fashion DJ, and there\u2019s not enough of us brown girls up there that are actually doing it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile her dual careers may seem to be a study in contrasts, Hyacinthe approaches both spinning and styling instinctively, using unexpected textural combinations to evoke new feelings. And in the process of embracing her dual passions, her own identity fell into place.\n\nI feel like deejaying has really helped me fully come into my skin. ... Even with race: It\u2019s like before, I thought that I needed to kind of neglect my own identity to be accepted. And I know I\u2019m not the only one that feels that way; as a black woman in the fashion industry, which is predominantly white. I thought that I needed to strip some of my identity\u2014the fact that I listened to hip-hop, the fact that I loved it, the fact that I came from the Bronx\u2014I thought that I almost needed to move away from that in order for me to be seen in society as being this elegant person in fashion ... [but] I feel like once you accept yourself, they have no choice but to accept you for who you are. And I feel like deejaying has really allowed me to accept myself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up tip: If you\u2019re in the New York City area, you can catch DJ Soda Pop every Thursday night at the Museum of Sex at 233 Fifth Ave. She launches her weekly residency Thursday night with a viewing party for RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race.", "keywords": ["wardrobe", "career", "hyacinthe", "feel", "dressed", "life", "fashion", "women", "dj", "york", "think", "night", "really", "inside", "sophia", "double", "dope"], "polarity": 0.16347579051383396, "subjectivity": 0.5693305335968378},

Not-Ivanka claims that he didn\u2019t know the name of the person with whom he would be meeting before it took place, but CNN has confirmed that the Russian lawyer he met with was Natalia Veselnitskaya.\n\nBecause the then-TrumPutin campaign, now TrumPutin administration, had a not-love affair with Clinton, Not-Ivanka invited Got Dem Visas and disgraced Manafort along for the meeting. Not-Ivanka claims that the other two had no idea of the substance of the meeting but agreed to attend anyway.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAfter pleasantries were exchanged, the woman stated that she had information that individuals connected to Russia were funding the Democratic National Committee and supporting Ms. Clinton,\u201d Trump Jr. said in the statement, CNN reports. \u201cHer statements were vague, ambiguous and made no sense. No details or supporting information was provided or even offered. It quickly became clear that she had no meaningful information.\u201d\n\nNot-Ivanka claims that the subject of the meeting quickly switched to the adoption of Russian children and a U.S. law known as the Magnitsky Act, \u201cwhich allows the U.S. to withhold visas and freeze the assets of Russians thought to have violated human rights,\u201d CNN reports.\n\nNot-Ivanka claims that the meeting became pointless for those in attendance who hate Hillary Clinton, since it appeared that Veselnitskaya had pulled a bait-and-switch on the group, bringing them in under the pretense of providing damaging information about their rival, only to push her true agenda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt became clear to me that this was the true agenda all along and that the claims of potentially helpful information were a pretext for the meeting. I interrupted and advised her that my father was not an elected official, but rather a private citizen, and that her comments and concerns were better addressed if and when he held public office,\u201d Not-Ivanka\u2019s statement read, according to CNN.\n\nNot-Ivanka claims that the meeting lasted only 20-30 minutes.\n\n\u201cAs it ended, my acquaintance apologized for taking up our time. That was the end of it, and there was no further contact or follow-up of any kind. My father knew nothing of the meeting or these events,\u201d Not-Ivanka said.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the Times, the meeting took place at Trump Tower on June 9, 2016, two weeks after TrumPutin had secured the Republican presidential nomination. The disclosure marks the first time TrumPutin\u2019s administration has acknowledged that a senior member of TrumPutin\u2019s Cabinet met with a Russian national during the campaign.\n\nVeselnitskaya\u2019s account of events from that day conflict with Not-Ivanka\u2019s claims. She told the New York Times, \u201cNothing at all was discussed about the presidential campaign.\u201d She added, \u201cI have never acted on behalf of the Russian government and have never discussed any of these matters with any representative of the Russian government.\u201d\n\n\n\nHere is where all of this gets amusing: In March, Not-Ivanka told the Times that he\u2019d never met with any Russians while working in a campaign capacity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDid I meet with people that were Russian? I\u2019m sure, I\u2019m sure I did,\u201d he said. \u201cBut none that were set up. None that I can think of at the moment. And certainly none that I was representing the campaign in any way, shape or form.\u201d\n\nIn fact, TrumPutin, Vice President Mike Pence and resident dunce (which is a hard title to get in this administration) Kellyanne Conway confirmed that there had been no contact between Russians and TrumPutin\u2019s campaign before the election, the Washington Post reports.\n\nAnd Not-Ivanka has blown all of that out of the water. Now the spin by this New York Knicks administration is to claim that the meeting was only about Russian adoptions and nothing else.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet\u2019s see how this all shakes out, but I won\u2019t be holding my breath.

Designer Brandon Maxwell\u2019s newly launched Spring/Summer 2018 advertising campaign, starring British model Jourdan Dunn and her surprise date, is a follow-up to his two previous and equally stunning campaign videos featuring models Riley Montana and Joan Smalls.\n\nGorgeous clothes, perfect bodies and pretty faces are the least of what we\u2019re treated to in Maxwell\u2019s videos, written and directed by the designer himself in collaboration with his longtime creative partner, Jessy Price. Each is striking in its intimacy as Maxwell unzips the model mystique, allowing us to peer into the souls of the women he loves to dress.\n\nFashion has a fairy-tale quality to it, and it\u2019s an element illustrated by Maxwell\u2019s clothes juxtaposed against the backdrop of his models\u2019 everyday lives. In his most recent campaign, Dunn gets confessional about her own transformative journey into modeling and motherhood, both while she was still a teenager. Dunn\u2019s life as a mother lies at the center of her video, filmed with her own tiny Prince Charming, 8-year-old son Riley.\n\nIt\u2019s a pure fantasy of a mother-son scenario, but nonetheless one that speaks to the dream of how we all like to think of those magical days of childhood, a time when seeing your mother happy, dressed up and looking lovely\u2014along with an extra ride on the carousel and a second ice cream\u2014was, in fact, real magic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up caught up with Maxwell via Instagram while he was burning the midnight oil, creating his next collection\u2014only two weeks away from being presented at New York Fashion Week. For him, Dunn\u2019s campaign video expresses something very special:\n\nIt\u2019s not about who you are, nor how much you can provide for your child; it\u2019s about the relationship, the act of doing something together, the love of a mother and the safety you feel when she says to you through action, \u201cYou matter, I see you, and I love you, right where you are.\u201d\n\nIn Maxwell\u2019s Fall/Winter 2017 campaign video, superstrong Puerto Rican model Joan Smalls celebrated her career and craft. She tells us not so much about herself, but reminds us that we should not forget the humanity of people, no matter the package in which they come\u2014glamorous or otherwise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDrenched in sunlight, wearing a cocktail dress, Smalls displays the discipline of a soldier as a team of tailors pins the little black dress to fit Smalls\u2019 tight curves while she stands stock-still.

When confronted with any statistic that shows widespread inequality, Fox News watchers, people who own \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d paraphernalia and even Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders supporters who \u201cdon\u2019t see color\u201d all propose the same theory:\n\nIf \u201cthe blacks\u201d concentrated on family, hard work and education, they could eliminate income disparities. America doesn\u2019t have a race problem; we have a class problem.\n\nThe New York Times reports that a new study by Harvard and Stanford economists disproves those arguments. Research from the Equality of Opportunity Project (pdf) shows that black boys raised in good neighborhoods by wealthy, two-parent families still don\u2019t have the economic potential of low-income white boys.\n\nThe research nullifies the conservative argument, placing the whitesplained dismissal of white supremacy in a category defined by a rarely used, neoclassical academic term:\n\nBullshit.\n\nFor black boys in America, upward mobility has nothing to do with education, class or work ethic. They will likely earn less money than white kids who grew up in worse neighborhoods. They will probably earn less than white boys from poorer families. They will be locked out from every access point to the American dream, and the data proves it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProfessor Ibram Kendi, director of the Antiracist Research and Policy Center at American University, told the Times, \u201cOne of the most popular liberal post-racial ideas is the idea that the fundamental problem is class and not race, and clearly this study explodes that idea.\u201d Kendi added, \u201cBut for whatever reason, we\u2019re unwilling to stare racism in the face.\u201d\n\nUsing demographics and income numbers from virtually all Americans in their 30s, the study cited in the Times takes data from the U.S. Census Bureau and \u201cde-identified longitudinal data covering nearly the entire U.S. population from 1989-2015\u201d to reach conclusions that dispel three myths about upward mobility in America.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMyth No. 1: It\u2019s not racism. It\u2019s a class issue.\n\nIt is true that Asians, Hispanics and white children all achieve upward mobility as defined by income. Black children ... not so much.\n\nFor instance, black children born in the bottom fifth of income earners have about a 2.5 percent chance of reaching the top fifth of the income bracket. White children, by contrast, have a 10.6 percent chance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven black children who grow up in high-income households fare no better. African Americans with parents in the top money-making category are as likely to fall to the bottom as they are to remain on top. White children whose parents are in the top quintile, however, are five times more likely to stay on top as they are to fall to the bottom.\n\nBlack males are still more likely to be incarcerated across every economic stratum. According to the demographic data, black men raised by millionaires are as likely to be incarcerated as white men raised by families earning $36,000 per year.\n\nMyth No. 2: Black people need to concentrate on family, education and work ethic.\n\nSome hypothesize that the disparity in standardized test scores may explain the income gap. But the study shows that black men don\u2019t have access to upward mobility even when factors such as marriage rates, educational attainment and parents\u2019 income are figured in. The research shows that the income gap exists mainly because of the low incomes of black males.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor example, there is little difference in standardized test results between black men and black women, but black men still have a substantially higher income gap than black women.\n\nYet when comparing children who grow up in two-parent homes, black men fare worse economically. When looking at the wealth of parents, black men still do worse. In fact, the only indicator in which black men seem to outpace their white counterparts is incarceration rates.\n\nMyth No. 3: It\u2019s probably because they grew up in the ghetto.\n\nOf course, poor neighborhoods don\u2019t have as many \u201cresources\u201d as wealthier neighborhoods, which might lead to income disparities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNah, b. You can\u2019t blame this one on \u201cthe hood.\u201d\n\nThe research shows that black males whose parents have the same income and grew up in the same neighborhoods as white families still suffer from higher incarceration rates and wage inequality\u2014even if they grew up on the same block.\n\nAccording to the study, white boys who grew up in the worst areas for economic mobility do better than black boys who grew up in some of the best neighborhoods. In fact, for 99 percent of the neighborhoods in the U.S., black males earn less as adults than white men who grew up in comparable neighborhoods with comparable families.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe study notes that black boys seem to benefit from moving to better neighborhoods, although not as much as white boys.\n\nBut what about black girls?\n\nThere are some who have read the Times\u2019 article and addressed the notion that the research seemed to omit data about black women:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe New York Times piece doesn\u2019t specifically address the data on black girls, but the full study does.\n\nIt notes that black women attend college at higher rates than white men and earn slightly more than white women when parental income is factored in. The study details the findings that the wage gap is much starker for black men but adds:\n\nIt is important to note, however, that this finding does not imply that the black-white gap in women\u2019s individual incomes will vanish with time. This is because black women continue to have substantially lower levels of household income than white women, both because they are less likely to be married and because black men earn less than white men (Online Appendix Figure IV). As a result, black girls grow up in lower-income households than white girls in each generation, creating a persistent racial disparity in individual income for women even in the absence of an intergenerational gap in their individual incomes. ... We therefore focus on understanding the determinants of intergenerational gaps between black and white men in the rest of the paper.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe results of the study highlight the fact that America cannot address economic inequality and the wage gap without discussing race. While it is impossible to quantify success, income disparity is key in understanding the disparities embedded in American society.\n\n\n\nWhile black America has pointed out these disparities for a long time, this study shows that even when black children begin at the same starting point as their white counterparts, they don\u2019t have equal access to the rungs on the ladder leading to the American dream.\n\nAs this research proves, addressing segregation, community resources and the education system is necessary. But there is only one thing that explains the fact that every factor of our social structure is tilted against black children:\n\nWhite supremacy.", "keywords": ["things", "white", "income", "neighborhoods", "proves", "boys", "research", "black", "grew", "study", "children", "gap", "men", "equal"], "polarity": 0.040120167189132645, "subjectivity": 0.3860135841170321},

Why do you call it a myth?\n\nBecause giving to the top and waiting for what was given to trickle down to the poor has never worked in the history of mankind. Most corporations use loopholes and trickery to never pay the effective tax rate. This is their right because the main goal of any business is to make as much profit as possible. But even when their taxes are lowered, corporations don\u2019t suddenly morph from being free-market capitalists to well-meaning Marxists and redistribute their newfound wealth among workers. They pocket it.\n\nLet me ask you a question: If you received a raise tomorrow, would you go to the grocery store and tell the cashier that you\u2019re willing to pay more for milk and bread?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHell no! But what does this have to do with the tax bill?\n\nBecause that is what this tax bill does. The biggest tax breaks go to the wealthy and to corporations. The people living below the poverty line barely get a break at all, while those making between $500,000 and $1 million get the biggest break of all. Republicans call it \u201cinvesting in the economy.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhere will the money come from?\n\nThe poor and middle class. According to the Pew Research Center\u2019s 2015 numbers, people making under $500,000 pay 61 percent of the income taxes in America. The Republicans plan to borrow the \u201cinvestment money\u201d from you, flip it and give it right back ... they promise.\n\nBut you said trickle-down economics doesn\u2019t work. What if they don\u2019t give it back?\n\nWhy are you always bringing up old shit?\n\nSure, this giveaway to corporate interests will add $1.4 trillion to the deficit, but haven\u2019t you ever heard the saying: \u201cIt takes money to make money\u201d? Whenever anyone tells you that, they\u2019re always referring to your money.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I thought they were concerned about the deficit.\n\nRepublicans are like the husband who complains about how the light bill is keeping him in the poor house, but who goes to the strip club every Friday night and makes it rain. Conservatives fancy themselves as \u201cdeficit hawks\u201d when it comes to Social Security, welfare, Medicare and health care, but will make it rain on the big-booty donors and lobbyists willing to shake their titties in their campaign-collection Champagne rooms.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut how will this affect me?\n\nTrust me, if you are poor or middle-class, here\u2019s what will happen:\n\nIt will kill health care. Rather than repeal the Affordable Care Act, the bill removes the individual mandate to buy health insurance, which is the mechanism the ACA used to keep health care premiums low. Premiums will rise, making the individual market too expensive for the poor, unemployed or entrepreneurs. The Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program already ran out of funding, and Republicans say they will attack health care next.\n\n\n\nRather than repeal the Affordable Care Act, the bill removes the individual mandate to buy health insurance, which is the mechanism the ACA used to keep health care premiums low.

But I didn\u2019t realize it then, because I never talked money with my co-workers. I chose to operate within the siloed American work culture that silences discussions about pay.\n\nAs a freelance writer, I\u2019ve struggled with owning my worth and demanding commensurate financial compensation.

Meals at most lunch spots, once you include tax, will run higher than that (a Shake Shack double costs $8.09, for example).\n\n\n\nBut that amount\u2014a measly $8\u2014is making the rounds thanks to a Boston Globe spotlight investigation that delves into the city\u2019s history of racism.\n\nCiting a study from 2015, \u201cThe Color of Wealth,\u201d the Boston Globe listed the median wealth of a series of Bostonians based on their racial and ethnic backgrounds. The median net worth for white households in Boston, for example, was $247,500. For Caribbean-born black people, it was $12,000.\n\nBut for blacks native to the U.S., the median net worth of an entire household was just $8. Some readers thought it was a typo, prompting the Globe to publish another article explaining that it wasn\u2019t.\n\nPut another way, that means the median white household in Boston is worth nearly 31,000 times more than a black American household.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNet worth was even lower for Dominicans living in the Boston area. The median net worth of their households was $0.\n\nSo how does this happen? It\u2019s important to separate net worth (or wealth) from income. Wealth measures the total number of assets\u2014both financial (your income, your 401[k], your life insurance) and tangible (your house, your car)\u2014minus your total debt (your student loans, your mortgage, your credit card balances).\n\n\n\nIn 2015, the difference between black American Bostonians owning more than what they owed was one meal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe reasons that black American households would have fewer assets and more debt are myriad and historical: Black Americans have been systematically denied access to assets (housing discrimination, job discrimination and the carceral state are but a few factors), while being uniquely vulnerable to debt. Even now, a relatively new phenomenon\u2014the student loan crisis\u2014disproportionately affects black grads.\n\nBoston isn\u2019t exactly atypical when it comes to racial wealth disparities, either. The gap is certainly starker, but study after study makes clear that the overall picture for black American wealth is bleak. One recent study found that black middle-class households nationwide were losing wealth\u2014and if such trends continued, they were only a few decades away from having zero net worth.\n\nIn Boston, as with the rest of the country, the wealth gap isn\u2019t accidental: Racially restrictive housing covenants were intentional. Redlining was intentional. Predatory loans were\u2014and remain\u2014intentional.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe worth of black American households in Boston isn\u2019t a typo\u2014nor is it a mistake.\n\nRead more at the Boston Globe.", "keywords": ["worth", "lunch", "cost", "households", "bostonians", "lower", "black", "median", "isnt", "study", "boston", "wealth", "american", "net"], "polarity": 0.0432747113997114, "subjectivity": 0.30418290043290047},

It\u2019s a class issue.\n\nIt is true that Asians, Hispanics and white children all achieve upward mobility as defined by income.

White children, by contrast, have a 10.6 percent chance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven black children who grow up in high-income households fare no better. African Americans with parents in the top money-making category are as likely to fall to the bottom as they are to remain on top. White children whose parents are in the top quintile, however, are five times more likely to stay on top as they are to fall to the bottom.\n\nBlack males are still more likely to be incarcerated across every economic stratum. According to the demographic data, black men raised by millionaires are as likely to be incarcerated as white men raised by families earning $36,000 per year.\n\nMyth No. 2: Black people need to concentrate on family, education and work ethic.\n\nSome hypothesize that the disparity in standardized test scores may explain the income gap. But the study shows that black men don\u2019t have access to upward mobility even when factors such as marriage rates, educational attainment and parents\u2019 income are figured in. The research shows that the income gap exists mainly because of the low incomes of black males.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor example, there is little difference in standardized test results between black men and black women, but black men still have a substantially higher income gap than black women.\n\nYet when comparing children who grow up in two-parent homes, black men fare worse economically. When looking at the wealth of parents, black men still do worse. In fact, the only indicator in which black men seem to outpace their white counterparts is incarceration rates.\n\nMyth No. 3: It\u2019s probably because they grew up in the ghetto.\n\nOf course, poor neighborhoods don\u2019t have as many \u201cresources\u201d as wealthier neighborhoods, which might lead to income disparities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNah, b. You can\u2019t blame this one on \u201cthe hood.\u201d\n\nThe research shows that black males whose parents have the same income and grew up in the same neighborhoods as white families still suffer from higher incarceration rates and wage inequality\u2014even if they grew up on the same block.\n\nAccording to the study, white boys who grew up in the worst areas for economic mobility do better than black boys who grew up in some of the best neighborhoods. In fact, for 99 percent of the neighborhoods in the U.S., black males earn less as adults than white men who grew up in comparable neighborhoods with comparable families.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe study notes that black boys seem to benefit from moving to better neighborhoods, although not as much as white boys.\n\nBut what about black girls?\n\nThere are some who have read the Times\u2019 article and addressed the notion that the research seemed to omit data about black women:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe New York Times piece doesn\u2019t specifically address the data on black girls, but the full study does.\n\nIt notes that black women attend college at higher rates than white men and earn slightly more than white women when parental income is factored in. The study details the findings that the wage gap is much starker for black men but adds:\n\nIt is important to note, however, that this finding does not imply that the black-white gap in women\u2019s individual incomes will vanish with time. This is because black women continue to have substantially lower levels of household income than white women, both because they are less likely to be married and because black men earn less than white men (Online Appendix Figure IV). As a result, black girls grow up in lower-income households than white girls in each generation, creating a persistent racial disparity in individual income for women even in the absence of an intergenerational gap in their individual incomes. ... We therefore focus on understanding the determinants of intergenerational gaps between black and white men in the rest of the paper.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe results of the study highlight the fact that America cannot address economic inequality and the wage gap without discussing race.

Thirty-three years after the South lost the Civil War, gangs of white men took to the streets in the port city of Wilmington. In a single day, they murdered as many as 60 black people, drove untold others from their homes, burned black businesses to the ground and overthrew the mixed-race government that had been elected two days prior. Before Nov. 10, 1898, Wilmington was a majority-black city.\n\nIt hasn\u2019t been ever since. And the names of the white supremacists who assumed power after the massacre remain emblazoned on street signs, government buildings and college auditoriums.\n\n\ufeffBlack wealth, stifled at the root and then stamped on subsequently, in each following generation, in myriad cruel, deliberate ways.\n\nOne of the businesses burned down was the Daily Record, a black newspaper at the center of the riot.

What untold millions has this country given up\u2014willingly\u2014to keep black bodies in their place?\n\nBlack wealth, stifled at the root and then stamped on subsequently, in each following generation, in myriad cruel, deliberate ways.\n\nTo look at the wealth gap as it is in 2017 is to look at the evidence of an accumulated, and ongoing, economic massacre.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(Not) Understanding the Racial Wealth Gap\n\nThe statistics are consistent, and they are overwhelming. For every $100 in wealth a white family has, black families hold just $5.04. The average white family is worth an astonishing $600,000 more than the average black family. Black middle-class families may have zero wealth in less than 40 years. One study found that, without the family car, black wealth would \u201cbarely exist.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe black middle class is shrinking, but despite the abundance of research that illuminates this, there is no urgency. In fact, one recent study found that both white and black Americans vastly underestimate how big the wealth gap really is.\n\nThe problem? Americans don\u2019t seem to understand what wealth means.\n\nIncome, the amount of money you earn every year, is frequently confused with wealth, which is the sum total of all your assets\u2014minus your debt. It\u2019s a basic financial concept, but at least one study has shown that Americans may not really grasp the difference.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichael Kraus, one of the Yale researchers who conducted a study that looked at how black and white Americans perceive the racial wealth gap, explained: \u201cThe estimates looked the same for wealth and income, which suggests that people are not differentiating.\u201d This, even though respondents were given explicit definitions of wealth vs. income.\n\nKnowing Your History\n\nThe causes of the racial wealth gap are well-documented. For hundreds of years, black Americans were either denied the ability to purchase land or start businesses\u2014or run the ones they had built. In the 1950s, when the U.S. government made owning a home the cornerstone of the so-called American dream, racist housing policies locked black people out of the market. That history alone is difficult ground to make up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut add to that the impact of mass incarceration. Anti-black job discrimination hasn\u2019t improved in over 25 years. Tax policies continue to privilege the very wealthy (who are disproportionately white). Bank of America and Wells Fargo are still being accused of predatory lending by targeting minority home buyers. And the student loan debt crisis\u2014fueled by the exploitative practices of for-profit institutions\u2014disproportionately affects black graduates.\n\nYet all too often, the gap in prosperity is treated as though it\u2019s some moral failing on the part of black Americans, that it\u2019s a lack of personal responsibility. That is, if it\u2019s talked about at all. \ufeffIt\u2019s how people like Amanda Seales can continue, in 2017, to chastise people for buying \u201cJordans and Nike suits,\u201d as if poor consumer choices are what drives black America\u2019s wealth crisis.\n\nThe United States of Amnesia\n\n\u201cPeople either forget about it or look for reasons to explain it away.\u201d \u2014Jennifer Richeson, Yale Psychology Professor\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s hard to assess wealth at face value. Two people can have the same job, wear the same clothes, drive the same car and have two very different wealth profiles. And because we can\u2019t immediately perceive the wealth gap, it may be tempting to forget it\u2019s there\u2014even though we\u2019ve seen the headlines repeatedly.\n\n\n\nAs Yale psychology professor Jennifer Richeson\u2014a co-author of the racial-wealth-gap study\u2014told me, some cognitive dissonance is at play. No matter how many times people encounter the data on the wealth gap, many are still shocked.\n\n\u201cPeople are surprised because we have this clear ... narrative of racial progress and these clear examples, like Barack Obama. Surely we must have made some progress,\u201d said Richeson, who received a MacArthur \u201cgenius\u201d grant. The persistence and expansion of the racial wealth gap goes against everything some people believe to be true about \u201cequal-opportunity America,\u201d she added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult and challenging, and either people forget about it or ... look for reasons to explain it away,\u201d Richeson said.\n\nA belief in meritocracy also primes people to believe that the racial wealth gap isn\u2019t that bad\u2014and both black Americans and white Americans are susceptible.\n\nPeople like Amanda Seales continue, in 2017, to chastise people for buying \u201cJordans and Nike suits,\u201d as if poor consumer choices are what drives black America\u2019s wealth crisis.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRicheson and Kraus found that a belief in societal fairness led Americans to overestimate racial economic equality. This, they say, is because people generally like to believe that their wealth is earned through their hard work and talent. But this myopia can and does blind us to the reality of how wealth actually works.\n\nSolutions\n\nThe wealth gap is measurable. The stats are dizzying. The causes are clear. It is not accidental. If there is any good news, it\u2019s that there are a number of policy fixes\u2014clear, specific proposals that would target the yawning gap between white families and families of color.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause so many people have analyzed the racial wealth gap in this country, there is no shortage of targeted, specific solutions. In casual conversations, I often hear friends and acquaintances talk about addressing economic problems on personal terms: We need more financial literacy, they\u2019ll say. Or we need to support black businesses.\n\nWhile those initiatives are important, the racial wealth gap is so dire\u2014and draws from so many causes\u2014that policy solutions are not just necessary, they\u2019re overdue.\n\n\n\nIn Fortune magazine, Josh Hoxie, director of the Project on Opportunity and Taxation and co-editor of Inequality.org, listed several such policies. They include expanding mortgage interest deductions, which promote homeownership by offering tax breaks; government-subsidized children\u2019s savings accounts; and a federal jobs guarantee\u2014an idea championed by none other than Martin Luther King Jr.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTackling the student debt crisis is also imperative. Despite what many Americans believe, education alone cannot close the wealth gap\u2014a fact made soberingly clear by the fact that black families with a college graduate still have less wealth than a white family with a high school diploma. For-profit colleges need to be taken to task for defrauding graduates\u2014a solution that is frustratingly unlikely with Betsy DeVos helming the Department of Education.\n\nThis is important to consider as we head into another election year when economic issues continue to dominate the political landscape.\n\n\u201cSolving [the racial-inequality problem] would solve the class-inequality problem more broadly.\u201d \u2014Michael kraus, professor at yale school of management\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUntil Americans take the racial wealth gap seriously, addressing racial and economic equality is simply impossible. At the heart of it all is accepting the notion, once and for all, that class and race are inextricable.\n\n\n\nWhen I asked Richeson what she thought of the phrase \u201cIt\u2019s not race, it\u2019s class,\u201d she said that Americans can\u2019t talk about one as if the other doesn\u2019t exist or matter: \u201cDenying the significance of race is really not going to solve this problem or any number of other problems.\u201d\n\nKraus, meanwhile, thought the phrase ought to be reversed.\n\n\u201cThe race-based economic-inequality problem that we observed is historical. The economic wealth of our country is built on it,\u201d Kraus pointed out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe racial-inequality problem, solving it would solve the class-inequality problem more broadly,\u201d he added. \u201cOur data suggests that.\u201d", "keywords": ["class", "white", "cant", "addresses", "america", "black", "gap", "wealth", "problem", "forward", "racial", "economic", "americans", "family", "race", "look"], "polarity": -0.00657348618459728, "subjectivity": 0.3881287477954145},

That comes through in the film,\u201d she said.\n\nAlthough the film puts her father at the forefront, Mpho says it\u2019s important to remember that there are many people with important stories that don\u2019t get told.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAlthough my father\u2019s role in this film looms large, it soon becomes evident that the real heroes and heroines of this story are those who are often called the little people\u2014people who are so often forgotten and whose names we don\u2019t know.

Black women were paid 63 percent of that amount.\n\nDamn.\n\nThese statistics are proof that we need a circle of sistah-friends like Wanda to confirm when we\u2019re being lowballed and to teach us how to proceed when we\u2019re offered paltry pay.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThankfully, today\u2019s Hollywood is filled with examples of sistah-friends who are making BOSS money moves and helping each other do the same. We know many of them\u2014well, at least we think we do\u2014since we follow them on social media:\n\nShonda and Viola\n\nMega TV producer Shonda Rhimes is intent on helping women garner the jobs and money they\u2019re due. When Rhimes courted actress Viola Davis to play Annalise Keating in How to Get Away With Murder\u2014a role that has secured her both Emmy and SAG Award wins\u2014Rhimes is credited with asking Davis \u201cWhat do you need to be happy?\u201d Apparently, $250,000 an episode (the salary Davis now reportedly receives) was enough.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRhimes is no stranger to asking for what she needs to be happy. According to Forbes, the writer-producer makes more than $10 million a year in her deal with ABC, not including lucrative back-end fees from syndication or licensing.\n\nOprah and Ava\n\nOprah Winfrey and Ava DuVernay are another sistah squad where each member uses her individual clout to support and uplift the other. Now, granted, Oprah doesn\u2019t need anybody to uplift her\u2014she\u2019s richer than Black Jesus. But still, their dynamic partnership\u2014Oprah starring in Selma and DuVernay\u2019s upcoming film, A Wrinkle In Time, and Ava creating Queen Sugar for the Oprah Winfrey Network\u2014is #SquadGoals. Let\u2019s also remember that Oprah is famous for advising up-and-coming black entertainers about how to manage their coins: \u201cSign your own checks.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWanda Sykes is only one of a few heavy hitters who are publicly disclosing their \u201cpaltry\u201d paychecks. In a recently leaked meeting, Tracee Ellis Ross revealed that she makes \u201csignificantly less\u201d than Black-ish co-star Anthony Anderson.\n\nAs actress Jada Pinkett Smith recently tweeted:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf Hollywood\u2019s black leading ladies are being shafted, then how much more are we being undervalued and underpaid overall?\n\nTime\u2019s truly up on us being lowballed or, worse\u2014lowballing ourselves.\n\nAfter I left my full-time job three years ago, I learned a disturbing fact: As a director, I had been paid the same salary as a colleague who was a manager. I was two promotions ahead of her, a few years her senior; heck\u2014I had helped train her when she was an intern. Yet we made the same amount.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuddenly I realized that I should have ignored my boss\u2019s encouragement to keep my salary a secret. Every time I received a slight pay raise, she made it seem as if she had advocated for me, and advised me not to discuss it with my colleagues, for fear that they would become jealous.\n\nToday I recognize that my pay increases were minuscule compared with what I could have received. But I didn\u2019t realize it then, because I never talked money with my co-workers. I chose to operate within the siloed American work culture that silences discussions about pay.\n\nAs a freelance writer, I\u2019ve struggled with owning my worth and demanding commensurate financial compensation. Two years ago, a publication invited me to become a regular contributor. I asked my community of women writers what to charge. They suggested rates, standard industry rates, but the rates felt too high to me. I quoted the editor 55 percent less than what my peers suggested.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen he responded with, \u201cThat\u2019s very doable,\u201d I immediately knew that I had lowballed myself. For whatever reason, I didn\u2019t think that my work warranted the higher rate. In other words, I didn\u2019t believe in myself.\n\nArguably more than any other group, we as black women must fearlessly advocate for our paychecks, and it begins with the belief in our worth.\n\nAfter Viola Davis received her best actress Oscar, she surprisingly admitted to struggling with self-doubt. \u201cI still have the imposter syndrome,\u201d she told ABC News. \u201cSome days, I wake up and think, \u2018Everybody\u2019s gonna see me for the hack that I am \u2026 until I realize that I do know what I\u2019m doing.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe does know what she\u2019s doing.\n\nWe do, too.\n\nTo become the staunch advocates that our paychecks need us to be, we must do three things:\n\nNetwork\n\nWe need to connect with other black women\u2014inside and outside our industries. We must reach ahead and behind with the recognition that it feels as good to give as it does to receive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo do this, ask your colleagues which professional groups they belong to. Ask your friends if they have friends in your industry they can connect you to. Join online industry groups. I belong to about a dozen professional groups on Facebook, which have resulted in new contracts and increased confidence. My favorite group is a community of seven black women writers whom I connect with almost daily. We discuss our challenges, encourage one another and talk money. Each one is my Wanda Sykes.\n\nAsk\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to ask your sistah-friends what they make. Now, I know that can be a bit awkward, but you can simply say something like, \u201cI have a personal question for you: Do you mind sharing with me how much you made on project X?\u201d Or you can pose a more general question: \u201cDo you mind telling me the pay range for someone in your position? I want to ensure that I\u2019m not short-changing myself.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTell\n\nIf a sistah-friend asks about your paycheck, tell her! The longer we\u2019re all hush-hush about our pay, the longer we can all be lowballed. We must abandon the toxic, individualistic cultural mores that say that talking about money is taboo. We must relinquish long-held cultural norms that discourage us from \u201ctellin\u2019 our business\u201d\u2014because they no longer serve us. If we take a collective approach to owning our worth and demanding that worth, we will all rise, together.", "keywords": ["worth", "wanda", "pay", "black", "women", "know", "sykes", "money", "lowballed", "paid", "sistahfriend", "davis", "need"], "polarity": 0.06734326018808777, "subjectivity": 0.36487456987457},

The findings, published Tuesday, reveal that the wage gap has widened over the last 37 years.\n\nAccording to the report, the wage gap has widened more among women, but it is still larger among men. Black men\u2019s average hourly wages were 22.2 percent lower than those of white men in 1979 but were 31 percent lower by 2015. Black women were nearly equal with white women, with a wage gap of 6 percent in 1979, but by 2015 that gap had grown to 19 percent, and young black women (those with 0 to 10 years of experience) have been hardest hit since 2000.\n\nThe report goes on to state that education levels and other observable factors are not the primary reason for gaps growing. In fact, black people's completion of a bachelor\u2019s degree or more will not reduce the black-white wage gap. Black male college graduates entering the workforce with a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher were still at an 18 percent deficit relative to their white counterparts.\n\nWage gaps are growing primarily because of discrimination (or racial differences in skills or worker characteristics that are unobserved or unmeasured in the data) and growing earnings inequality in general. Thus, closing and eliminating the gaps will require intentional and direct action.\n\nThe EPI outlined steps that could be taken to close and eliminate the wage gaps, including the following:\n\n\n\nConsistently enforce antidiscrimination laws in the hiring, promotion, and pay of women and minority workers.\n\nConvene a high-level summit to address why black college graduates start their careers with a sizeable earnings disadvantage.\n\nUnder the leadership of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, identify the \u201cunobservable measures\u201d that impact the black-white wage gap and devise ways to include them in national surveys.\n\nUrge the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to work with experts to develop metropolitan area measures of discrimination that could be linked to individual records in the federal surveys so that researchers could directly assess the role that local area discrimination plays in the wage setting of African Americans and whites.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead the full report at the Economic Policy Institute.", "keywords": ["white", "report", "wage", "black", "women", "gap", "gaps", "growing", "wider", "1979", "discrimination", "americans"], "polarity": 0.05200077700077702, "subjectivity": 0.2947746697746698},

Brown (Getty Images)\n\nAt this point, it would probably be easier to start keeping a list of the men in entertainment who are not trash, but the trash list gets longer by the minute. The latest addition to the list is none other than R&B singer Trey Songz.\n\nLos Angeles Police Lt. Chris Ramirez told the Los Angeles Times that Tremaine Aldon Neverson, 33, was arrested early Monday morning by officers from the Los Angeles Police Department\u2019s Hollywood Division on charges stemming from an incident last month in which the singer was accused of punching and choking a female friend at a Hollywood Hills party.\n\nSongz was booked on felony assault charges and released on $50,000 bail, according to the Los Angeles County sheriff\u2019s inmate-locator system. He has a court date scheduled for April 9.\n\nSongz posted on Twitter that he is \u201cbeing lied on and falsely accused for someone else\u2019s personal gain.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast week, Andrea Buera\u2014who is a friend of Songz\u2019\u2014told reporters that on Feb. 18, while attending a party, she was physically attacked by him.\n\nBuera, who is represented by attorney Lisa Bloom, said that Songz began yelling at her, choking her and punching her before ultimately knocking her down on the ground.\n\nSongz allegedly continued to punch Buera while she was on the ground and did not relent until his security guard pulled him off of her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBuera was granted a temporary restraining order against Songz, and there is a hearing scheduled for March 27 to make that permanent.\n\nSongz denies all of the allegations. It is hard to fathom why someone would make up a story like that, much less go to the trouble of filing a police report, especially since knowingly filing a fake police report is a crime in California. She could face up to six months in the county jail for doing so, and trust me\u2014no one wants to spend six months in the county, especially a woman.\n\nBut, of course, these are just allegations at this point. Songz is innocent until proven guilty, but it is worth noting that he was already on probation in the state of Michigan after pleading guilty to charges of aggravated assault and punching a police officer six months ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo maybe, just maybe, he already has anger-management issues and a history of violence.\n\nWe should consider that when looking at this story.\n\nWhat do you think?

I don\u2019t have any disdain for her; she\u2019s just not my brand of bourbon, if you catch my drift. If I got free tickets to see a show in person, I may go depending on what else I had going on that particular evening. I have enjoyed some of her work\u2014I liked her in Almost Christmas, for instance\u2014but I\u2019m not typically going to check out anything specifically because of Mo\u2019Nique.\n\nOne quick scroll through my Facebook timeline over the past few days indicates that many people feel the same at the very least and absolutely hate her at worst. So much so that somehow, a black woman reasonably decrying unfair wage practices at the hands of a company (in this case, Netflix) is being met with the kind of opposition that Cardi B raps about so much.\n\nWhile I agree that calling for a boycott of Netflix is probably too high a hurdle for most of us, people are questioning her worth\u2014her ability to command $500, much less the $500,000 she was offered\u2014and whether she has a legit team around her. Apparently, wage discrimination isn\u2019t a thing for Mo\u2019Nique; it just turns out that she is neither marketable nor profitable. Glad that\u2019s been cleared up.\n\nLook, I can understand not liking her. You like who you like, but her words are being twisted. She never once said that she should be making as much as Chris Rock or Dave Chappelle or even Amy Schumer\u2014and you\u2019d think that she personally slapped each and every one of our mothers in the black community, causing folks to do the white man\u2019s work of attempting to prove to Netflix that they\u2019re right not to have offered her more.\n\nFor the record, I think she was lowballed. Absolutely I do. I think she deserves more than $500,000. How much more? I don\u2019t know; I\u2019m not a professional comedian financial analyst. But to hear that this professional comedian who has been in the game for well over 20 years and is well-known was offered $500,000 and that Wanda Sykes, a woman who is on a prime-time network hit show, Black-ish, was offered $250,000, which she turned down to take her talents elsewhere, is astounding to me. Especially in the midst of huge sums of money being offered to others. Is a Mo\u2019Nique special worth an Amy Schumer one? No. Worth more than 4 percent of her take? Absolutely.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnybody who has ever ventured into the world of creativity is aware that there\u2019s a tug-of-war for proper compensation. Contracts are often kept on the hush so that nobody knows what everybody else is making unless people are talking. What we have found out over the past, I don\u2019t know, 20-plus years is that women are paid less money than men for the same jobs. This is a fact. We know that the wage gap is a real thing.\n\nIn a world like comedy, pay is way more subjective than a simple one-to-one comparison of analysts at Booz Allen Hamilton. The thing is, the only way to make sure that companies ARE held to the fire is to put those things out there publicly. Mo\u2019Nique could have taken her loss and kept it moving. But she saw an injustice and spoke up about it. And what happened?\n\n\n\nApparently, Mo\u2019Nique is the wrong person to speak on it. Other comedians have come out mocking her. She\u2019s been dragged for thinking she\u2019s \u201cworth\u201d more than $500,000. How dare this black woman think she\u2019s got the right to ask for more?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe tone and tenor of most of the conversations seem to hover soundly on the fact that people don\u2019t like her that much. Maybe she\u2019s burned bridges or talked too much shit about folks. Yes, she\u2019s feuded with Lee Daniels, Tyler Perry and Oprah. Perhaps she was notoriously hard to work with. Does that mean that she\u2019s wrong? No. Is it possible that Netflix is intentionally lowballing their comedians who are black women? Yes.\n\nShit, do you care? It seems like while most of us are on the Colin Kaepernick-speaking-on-social-injustice bandwagon\u2014at least until the playoffs started\u2014Mo\u2019Nique asking for fair treatment in wages is a bridge too far. If you don\u2019t like her, she\u2019s full of shit. And that\u2019s trash. We can\u2019t let personal feelings, especially for somebody most of us don\u2019t actually know, get in the way of a real problem that exists and negatively impacts our community.\n\nIf you know her and she stole money from you or insulted your mother? Fine. I can understand that. But if you just don\u2019t like her or don\u2019t fuck with her comedy, why are you treating her like a black woman asking for too much, as if she\u2019s some person undeserving of the very same compensation you\u2019d want if you didn\u2019t get a raise to do the job you were already doing?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow many of us personally know people who have found out they were making less than somebody they were doing more than? While most of us don\u2019t have enough data points to lob the institutional-racism bomb at our employers, that doesn\u2019t make it untrue. But we\u2019ll never have the ammo if, when something seems awry, we shoot the messenger because we don\u2019t like them, going so far as to accuse them of thinking they\u2019re more valuable than they are, even if most of us really have nothing more than conjecture and assumptions.\n\nMaybe it turns out she\u2019s wrong. Maybe. Maybe whatever comedy market exists where the numbers shake out determines that Netflix properly assessed her \u201cvalue\u201d and she just needs to come to terms with it. Or maybe Netflix is doing EXACTLY what Hollywood and every other industry has done to black people and women since forever, which all of the black community agrees is a problem that needs to be addressed: unfairly compensating because of a lack of a perceived market because of race.

And I think a lot of times we don\u2019t do that. We spend our time pleasing, satisfying, looking out into the world to define who we are\u2014listening to the messages, the images, the limited definitions that people have of who we are. And that\u2019s true for women of color for sure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"There is a limited box that we are put in, and if we live by that limited definition, we miss out on a lot of who we are. But it takes taking the time to know who you are to be able to deal with the onslaught of negative messages that you\u2019re bound to get. So for me, I came into this with a pretty clear sense of myself. And some of that comes with age. Some of that comes with experience,\u201d the first lady concluded.\n\nThe United State of Women summit was a comprehensive gathering on women\u2019s issues in Washington featuring top leaders in business, technology and women\u2019s advocacy. The summit focused on pay equity, higher education, health issues, self-esteem and career advancement.\n\nWinfrey, Vice President Joe Biden and, of course, the first lady\u2019s husband, President Barack Obama, addressed the daylong event, which was packed with data and information on the current state of women in American society.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOur country isn\u2019t just all about the Benjamins\u2014it\u2019s about the Tubmans, too,\u201d the president said amusingly during his address.\n\n\u201cThe year I was born, in 1961, women made up less than 40 percent of college students. Today, you earn almost 60 percent of college degrees, make up roughly half of the workforce. \u2026 In the old days, women actually needed a husband to open a credit card. Today, more women are choosing to be single,\u201d President Obama added.\n\nDespite making up 47 percent of the U.S. workforce, women, on average, still only earn 77 cents for every dollar earned by a man. African-American women are paid 64 cents for each dollar white men are paid, and Hispanic women only make 54 cents for every dollar paid to white men.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast week the National Center For Education Statistics revealed that black women are No. 1 among all other groups in America in terms of overall college enrollment.\n\n\"As the great Shirley Chisholm once said, \u2018The emotional, sexual and psychological stereotyping of females begin[s] when the doctor says, \u201cIt\u2019s a girl.\u201d\u2019 That has consequences for all of us, whether we\u2019re men or women,\" President Obama said pointedly during the summit.\n\n\"We need to keep changing the attitude that raises our girls to be demure, and our boys to be assertive; that criticizes our daughters for speaking out, and our sons for shedding a tear,\" the president said, echoing some of the themes spoken throughout the day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nParticipants at the summit included Melanie Campbell, president of the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation; Anne Marie Chavez, CEO of Girl Scouts USA; Rep. Donna Edwards (D-Md.); Beth Williams, CEO of Roxbury Technology; and Debra Lee, CEO of Black Entertainment Television.\n\nOn June 23 the White House will host a summit around issues facing working families.

This also holds true for the Servicemen\u2019s Readjustment Act (GI Bill of Rights) of 1944, the affirmative action program created primarily for the benefit of white male veterans.\n\nThese programs and their ramifications have exposed how a flat economic analysis does not get to the core of the racial discrimination and animus running through this country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFor centuries, white households enjoyed wealth-building opportunities that were systematically denied to people of color. Today our policies continue to impede efforts by African-American and Latino households to obtain equal access to economic security,\u201d explains Amy Traub, associate director of policy and research at Demos and co-author of the report.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen research shows that racial privilege now outweighs a fundamental key to economic mobility, like higher education, we must demand our policymakers acknowledge this problem and create policies that address structural inequity,\u201d Traub continues.\n\n\n\nA few key points from the \u201cAsset Value of Whiteness\u201d:\n\nAttending College Does Not Close the Racial Wealth Gap\n\nThe median white adult who attended college has 7.2 times more wealth than the median black adult who attended college and 3.9 times more wealth than the median Latino adult who attended college.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRaising Kids in a Two-Parent Household Does Not Close the Racial Wealth Gap\n\nThe median white single parent has 2.2 times more wealth than the median black two-parent household and 1.9 times more wealth than the median Latino two-parent household.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWorking Full Time Does Not Close the Racial Wealth Gap\n\nThe median white household that includes a full-time worker has 7.6 times more wealth than the median black household with a full-time worker.

According to the report:\n\n\n\nOn average, white households spent $13,700 per quarter, compared to $8,400 for black households. Even after accounting for factors such as family structure, income, occupation, and geography, as well as wealth and homeownership, white households at all income levels continued to spend more than comparable black households, with low-income white households spending $1,200 more per quarter than low-income black households and high-income white households spending $1,400 more than their black counterparts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEqual achievements in key economic indicators, such as employment and education, do not lead to equal levels of wealth and financial security for households of color,\u201d notes Thomas Shapiro, director of the Institute on Assets and Social Policy.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhite households have a leg up, while households of color face systematic barriers to growing wealth, reproducing our long-standing racial wealth gap over generations,\u201d Shapiro continues. \u201cWithout policies that combat ingrained wealth inequalities, the racial wealth gap that we see today will continue to persist.\u201d\n\n\u201cAsset Value of Whiteness\u201d is the most recent in a series of studies from the Institute on Assets and Social Policy and Demos analyzing policy solutions to close the racial wealth gap and ensure that all Americans have an equal opportunity to participate in our economy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is clear is that a rising tide does not lift all boats if some of the boats have holes in them.

When confronted with any statistic that shows widespread inequality, Fox News watchers, people who own \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d paraphernalia and even Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders supporters who \u201cdon\u2019t see color\u201d all propose the same theory:\n\nIf \u201cthe blacks\u201d concentrated on family, hard work and education, they could eliminate income disparities. America doesn\u2019t have a race problem; we have a class problem.\n\nThe New York Times reports that a new study by Harvard and Stanford economists disproves those arguments. Research from the Equality of Opportunity Project (pdf) shows that black boys raised in good neighborhoods by wealthy, two-parent families still don\u2019t have the economic potential of low-income white boys.\n\nThe research nullifies the conservative argument, placing the whitesplained dismissal of white supremacy in a category defined by a rarely used, neoclassical academic term:\n\nBullshit.\n\nFor black boys in America, upward mobility has nothing to do with education, class or work ethic. They will likely earn less money than white kids who grew up in worse neighborhoods. They will probably earn less than white boys from poorer families. They will be locked out from every access point to the American dream, and the data proves it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProfessor Ibram Kendi, director of the Antiracist Research and Policy Center at American University, told the Times, \u201cOne of the most popular liberal post-racial ideas is the idea that the fundamental problem is class and not race, and clearly this study explodes that idea.\u201d Kendi added, \u201cBut for whatever reason, we\u2019re unwilling to stare racism in the face.\u201d\n\nUsing demographics and income numbers from virtually all Americans in their 30s, the study cited in the Times takes data from the U.S. Census Bureau and \u201cde-identified longitudinal data covering nearly the entire U.S. population from 1989-2015\u201d to reach conclusions that dispel three myths about upward mobility in America.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMyth No. 1: It\u2019s not racism. It\u2019s a class issue.\n\nIt is true that Asians, Hispanics and white children all achieve upward mobility as defined by income. Black children ... not so much.\n\nFor instance, black children born in the bottom fifth of income earners have about a 2.5 percent chance of reaching the top fifth of the income bracket. White children, by contrast, have a 10.6 percent chance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven black children who grow up in high-income households fare no better. African Americans with parents in the top money-making category are as likely to fall to the bottom as they are to remain on top. White children whose parents are in the top quintile, however, are five times more likely to stay on top as they are to fall to the bottom.\n\nBlack males are still more likely to be incarcerated across every economic stratum. According to the demographic data, black men raised by millionaires are as likely to be incarcerated as white men raised by families earning $36,000 per year.\n\nMyth No. 2: Black people need to concentrate on family, education and work ethic.\n\nSome hypothesize that the disparity in standardized test scores may explain the income gap. But the study shows that black men don\u2019t have access to upward mobility even when factors such as marriage rates, educational attainment and parents\u2019 income are figured in. The research shows that the income gap exists mainly because of the low incomes of black males.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor example, there is little difference in standardized test results between black men and black women, but black men still have a substantially higher income gap than black women.\n\nYet when comparing children who grow up in two-parent homes, black men fare worse economically. When looking at the wealth of parents, black men still do worse. In fact, the only indicator in which black men seem to outpace their white counterparts is incarceration rates.\n\nMyth No. 3: It\u2019s probably because they grew up in the ghetto.\n\nOf course, poor neighborhoods don\u2019t have as many \u201cresources\u201d as wealthier neighborhoods, which might lead to income disparities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNah, b. You can\u2019t blame this one on \u201cthe hood.\u201d\n\nThe research shows that black males whose parents have the same income and grew up in the same neighborhoods as white families still suffer from higher incarceration rates and wage inequality\u2014even if they grew up on the same block.\n\nAccording to the study, white boys who grew up in the worst areas for economic mobility do better than black boys who grew up in some of the best neighborhoods. In fact, for 99 percent of the neighborhoods in the U.S., black males earn less as adults than white men who grew up in comparable neighborhoods with comparable families.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe study notes that black boys seem to benefit from moving to better neighborhoods, although not as much as white boys.\n\nBut what about black girls?\n\nThere are some who have read the Times\u2019 article and addressed the notion that the research seemed to omit data about black women:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe New York Times piece doesn\u2019t specifically address the data on black girls, but the full study does.\n\nIt notes that black women attend college at higher rates than white men and earn slightly more than white women when parental income is factored in. The study details the findings that the wage gap is much starker for black men but adds:\n\nIt is important to note, however, that this finding does not imply that the black-white gap in women\u2019s individual incomes will vanish with time. This is because black women continue to have substantially lower levels of household income than white women, both because they are less likely to be married and because black men earn less than white men (Online Appendix Figure IV). As a result, black girls grow up in lower-income households than white girls in each generation, creating a persistent racial disparity in individual income for women even in the absence of an intergenerational gap in their individual incomes. ... We therefore focus on understanding the determinants of intergenerational gaps between black and white men in the rest of the paper.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe results of the study highlight the fact that America cannot address economic inequality and the wage gap without discussing race. While it is impossible to quantify success, income disparity is key in understanding the disparities embedded in American society.\n\n\n\nWhile black America has pointed out these disparities for a long time, this study shows that even when black children begin at the same starting point as their white counterparts, they don\u2019t have equal access to the rungs on the ladder leading to the American dream.\n\nAs this research proves, addressing segregation, community resources and the education system is necessary. But there is only one thing that explains the fact that every factor of our social structure is tilted against black children:\n\nWhite supremacy.", "keywords": ["things", "white", "income", "neighborhoods", "proves", "boys", "research", "black", "grew", "study", "children", "gap", "men", "equal"], "polarity": 0.040120167189132645, "subjectivity": 0.3860135841170321},

Struggling with his emotions and resentment toward his mother, Wilson turned to the martial arts.\n\nToday he\u2019s turned his childhood struggles and his passion for martial arts into an acclaimed academy for young boys, incorporating mentorship into martial arts training.\n\n\n\nWilson\u2019s teachings and mission are well-documented through his YouTube channel and have caught the eye of people around the world. A video of Wilson\u2019s \u201cSon-up\u201d ceremony, which was widely circulated online last year, landed him appearances on The Dr. Oz Show, Steve Harvey and Ellen: The Ellen Degeneres Show.\n\n\n\nHis teachings even caught the attention of Hollywood writers when NBC\u2019s This Is Us used a training method called \u201cthe Son-up,\u201d albeit initially without permission, in an episode titled \u201cThe Trip.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe characters Jack and his adopted son, Randall, enroll in a similar martial arts program in order to bond and give Randall some black male role models in his life. Near the end of the episode, we see Randall on his father\u2019s back as Jack does a series of pushups, just like those shown in Wilson\u2019s video.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter public and legal pressure, 20th Century Fox, the production company for This Is Us, eventually acknowledged in a tweet that the idea came from one of Wilson\u2019s viral videos. Wilson says that the producers of the show \u201cmade it right,\u201d and he got a chance to speak with them about the significance of his program.\n\n\n\n\u201c[The Son-up] is symbolic to the father saying publicly that he will support his son throughout this journey. That\u2019s what the producers of This Is Us liked so much,\u201d Wilson says. \u201cThe fathers are really engaged, and the boys who don\u2019t have fathers, the fathers that are here become their fathers.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe video, which has received more than 1.5 million views on YouTube, begins with a student breaking down in tears when completing a wood-breaking exercise, following which Wilson promptly coaches him by saying, \u201cIt\u2019s OK to cry.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI dropped to my knees to let him know he\u2019s the most important thing going on right now and help him navigate through his emotions,\u201d Wilson says. \u201cPeople of other ethnicities were commenting, \u2018Why don\u2019t we see more in the media about black boys being humans instead of being violent?\u2019 And I realized I just shattered this misperception of black boys in this one video because you don\u2019t usually see black boys crying.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilson\u2019s work at the Cave of Adullam Transformational Training Academy, started in 2008, is more than a martial arts program but, rather, a rite of passage into manhood. The boys engage in a combination of mentorship and jiujitsu, combat boxing and other martial arts, taking anywhere from three to five years to finish.\n\nOne of the focuses of the program is allowing the boys to identify the roots of their anger and emotions. Wilson pulls a lot of what he teaches from emotions he experienced growing up without his father.\n\n\n\n\u201cGrowing up, I started resenting my mother, and this happens over and over with boys,\u201d Wilson says.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe wanted to ensure that the boys in his program had a space where they could express their emotions.\n\n\n\n\u201cSociety as a whole tells our males to \u2018be a man,\u2019 but no one is teaching them how,\u201d Wilson says. \u201cAt the end of the day, they sit down and look at their chart of emotions.

Brown (Getty Images)\n\nAt this point, it would probably be easier to start keeping a list of the men in entertainment who are not trash, but the trash list gets longer by the minute. The latest addition to the list is none other than R&B singer Trey Songz.\n\nLos Angeles Police Lt. Chris Ramirez told the Los Angeles Times that Tremaine Aldon Neverson, 33, was arrested early Monday morning by officers from the Los Angeles Police Department\u2019s Hollywood Division on charges stemming from an incident last month in which the singer was accused of punching and choking a female friend at a Hollywood Hills party.\n\nSongz was booked on felony assault charges and released on $50,000 bail, according to the Los Angeles County sheriff\u2019s inmate-locator system. He has a court date scheduled for April 9.\n\nSongz posted on Twitter that he is \u201cbeing lied on and falsely accused for someone else\u2019s personal gain.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast week, Andrea Buera\u2014who is a friend of Songz\u2019\u2014told reporters that on Feb. 18, while attending a party, she was physically attacked by him.\n\nBuera, who is represented by attorney Lisa Bloom, said that Songz began yelling at her, choking her and punching her before ultimately knocking her down on the ground.\n\nSongz allegedly continued to punch Buera while she was on the ground and did not relent until his security guard pulled him off of her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBuera was granted a temporary restraining order against Songz, and there is a hearing scheduled for March 27 to make that permanent.\n\nSongz denies all of the allegations. It is hard to fathom why someone would make up a story like that, much less go to the trouble of filing a police report, especially since knowingly filing a fake police report is a crime in California. She could face up to six months in the county jail for doing so, and trust me\u2014no one wants to spend six months in the county, especially a woman.\n\nBut, of course, these are just allegations at this point. Songz is innocent until proven guilty, but it is worth noting that he was already on probation in the state of Michigan after pleading guilty to charges of aggravated assault and punching a police officer six months ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo maybe, just maybe, he already has anger-management issues and a history of violence.\n\nWe should consider that when looking at this story.\n\nWhat do you think?

That\u2019s what Steve Perry, Steve Harvey and the U.S. Army seem to be arguing. Recently, they teamed up to disseminate pearls for success to an audience of 200 young men of color.\n\nAccording to a tweet by Perry, the team had succeeded: \u201cI witnessed 200 boys VOLUNTARILY cut dreads, braids & unkept frosh bc @IAmSteveHarvey @USArmy connected aesthetics to success. Powerful.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs a dreadlocked neuroscientist, the first black tenured professor in the sciences, the first black chair of the department of psychology at Columbia University and the father of three black sons, I find this line of reasoning deplorably ignorant and deeply disturbing. Indeed, a tremendous amount of advice given to black boys by proselytizers confuses cause and effect, such that it blames things like hairstyles or saggy pants for high unemployment rates and poverty, among other negative outcomes.\n\nIn other words, this faulty logic suggests that these boys aren\u2019t hired for jobs because they have dreadlocks, or that they are shot and killed because they were wearing a hoodie. One of the most fundamental lessons of science is that a correlation or link between factors does not necessarily mean that one factor is the cause of another.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor example, there is a strong correlation between the number of nursing home admissions and the number of deaths. Some might conclude that nursing homes are killing people. This would, of course, be inaccurate. It simply means that people in the late stage of life are the ones admitted to nursing homes, where many have come to live before dying.\n\nIt is unfortunate and sad that Perry, the so-called most trusted educator in America, doesn\u2019t seem to understand the difference between correlation and causation, but it is far more pernicious when this type of ignorance leads to policies that regulate the behavior of black young people.\n\nIn his book, The Price of the Ticket, Fredrick Harris detailed the pervasiveness of this phenomenon (also known as respectability politics) at HBCUs. For instance, Hampton University\u2019s business school instituted a policy that prohibits male students from wearing \u201cdreadlocks, braids and other unusual hairstyles.\u201d Presumably, nondreadlocked students are viewed as \u201crespectable.\u201d Of course, this is not necessarily the case. For argument\u2019s sake, though, suppose they were seen as more proper. But they certainly aren\u2019t any smarter or any more prepared to compete in the workplace or for graduate school admission simply because of a haircut. Look, you don\u2019t have to be a brain scientist to know that one\u2019s choice of hairstyle has nothing to do with one\u2019s ability to compete academically or in the marketplace. Ultimately, it\u2019s about putting in the work to obtain the necessary skill set.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I was studying for my Ph.D., I decided to grow dreads after a lengthy conversation with a machine technician at a DC Metro station. I had complimented him on his dreads, thinking that he was a Rastafarian. For years I had considered growing locks myself but was reluctant because I believed that it was disrespectful if you weren\u2019t part of that religion. I also did not want to be seen as faddish or simply following the crowd: that\u2019s not me.\n\nBut this brotha said that for him, wearing dreads was a way of paying homage and respect, even though he wasn\u2019t religious. That resonated with me because listening to the music of Bob Marley\u2014undoubtedly the most iconic dreadlock\u2014first prompted me to really examine this society. Lines like \u201cstolen from Africa,\u201d in Marley\u2019s \u201cBuffalo Soldier,\u201d and \u201cbrainwash education to make us the fools,\u201d in his \u201cCrazy Baldheads,\u201d got me thinking about the heinous crime at the root of America\u2019s relationship with its black people. And I decided right then to grow dreads. My hair reminds me that I could be myself and a conscious spirit, no matter what other people might think a scientist should look like. It connects me both to my heritage and my children. It marks when I began the process of learning how to think. And 21 years later with sprinkles of gray, it still feels right.\n\nPeddlers of respectability politics should place more emphasis on teaching how to think, rather than on how to wear your hair, since this is irrelevant when it comes to acquiring any skills, especially academic and intellectual. Respectability politics has no place in education\u2014which means that those who only have it to offer don\u2019t, either.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso on The Root: \u201cBlack Aesthetic, White Supremacy: Steve Perry\u2019s Tweet Needs Cutting More Than Black Boys\u2019 Hair\u201d\n\nCarl Hart, Ph.D., is the first black tenured professor and the first black chair in the sciences at Columbia University.

I have deliberated Miguel\u2019s stance and potential to do a tribute to the Artist Formerly Known As The Artist and Now Currently Known As Prince. As an entertainer, Miguel is there. As a musician\u2026eh. As a songwriter, YES! As a sly shady motherfucker\u2026hmmm. But it takes a God-given talent to be an excellent entertainer, songwriter, guitar shredder and a master of shade. Who else can almost knock the shit out of James Brown fans and still look cool doing it? NO ONE. It\u2019ll be another lifetime before we get another PRINCE NELSON ROGERS. \u2026but we\u2019ll settle for the next Lenny Kravitz.\n\nKeep Alicia Keys in her vocal range\n\nWe all remember when Alicia Keys had the gumption to sing Prince\u2019s \u201cAdore\u201d at the highest of heights from her shallow lungs. Sure, she did an admiral cover of \u201cHow Come U Don\u2019t Call Me?\u201d But this isn\u2019t the same Alicia Keys of 2001. Maybe she\u2019s been on vocal rest for the past four years. Yet, I still don\u2019t trust her falsetto. Give her something simple to sing like, \u201cSometimes It Snows In April.\u201d Place her ass behind the keyboard and tell her to keep still physically and vocally. There are only a few with the vocal dexterity of Prince, and Alicia isn\u2019t one of them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nD\u2019Angelo, Maxwell and/or Bilal are mandatory\n\nSpeaking of vocal dexterity you absolutely have to include at least one of these singers. If you don\u2019t include D\u2019Angelo, Maxwell and/or Bilal, I\u2019ll reduce my cable package to just one channel. And that one channel would be TV One.\n\nMichael Eugene Archer on the guitar is a must. A funky number like \u201cBaby I\u2019m A Star,\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s Gonna B A Beautiful Night,\u201d \u201cControversy,\u201d \u201cThe Most Beautiful Girl In The World,\u201d \u201cAlphabet St.\u201d or his favorite \u201cMovie Star\u201d fits his musical narrative perfectly. Hell, let him do all six of these songs. Maxwell, of course, has to do a slow-burner. Songs like \u201cAdore,\u201d \u201cCall My Name,\u201d and \u201cDo Me Baby\u201d were written for his vocals. And Bilal. What other singer can capture the sadistic, quirky style of Prince? He would be perfect for \u201cThe Beautiful Ones\u201d or \u201cDarling Nikki.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA duet from Erykah Badu and Andre 3000\n\nHear me out.

Thank you!\n\nInclude the Wonderland squad\n\nEveryone knows Janelle Monae\u2019s musical aptitude and prolific performance capabilities as an entertainer. But it\u2019s her entire movement that resonates and reflects the legacy of Prince. The many talented people Prince put on spans from Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis to Tevin Campbell. Hell, even Janet Jackson owes Prince credit for the Minneapolis sound on Control and Rhythm Nation. Janelle Monae falls into the same category with her Wonderland crew, particularly Roman GianArthur. I had the pleasure of seeing him live twice. He embodies Prince in both style and musicianship, which is a rarity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInclude the OGs\n\nI\u2019ve listed all of the new schoolers, but we have to mention the old school. It is mandatory that you include Morris Day & The Time, Shelia E. and Wendy and Lisa. These artists worked with him during his prime and literally played an instrumental role in developing the Prince sound of the 80s. It\u2019s blasphemous and disrespectful not to mention their contributions to the Minneapolis sound. Besides, I really want to see Jerome get Morris\u2019 mirror one good time before he lives this earth. Stay strong Jerome\u2026stay strong!\n\nWho should sing Purple Rain?\n\nThis one is complicated. It\u2019s a classic. It really shouldn\u2019t be touched. Yet, it really isn\u2019t a Prince tribute without \u201cPurple Rain.\u201d I mean, no one can really do this song any justice. Not even Patti LaYelle. No disrespect. (Shout out to PattiLaHelle for the reference.) Sure Fanatasia and Jennifer Hudson have the vocal fortitude to carry it. But will they overdo it? And what about the guitar solo? This is why I say choose either one of these singers. Let Lenny Kravitz start it. Add Fantasia or J Hud (not both) to sing the second part. Finally, let Lenny rip the guitar to shreds. It\u2019s the only way our ears can survive a non-karaoke/karaoke version of \u201cPurple Rain.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know this sounds more like a concert instead of a 20 to 30-minute tribute. And you\u2019re right. This is how much of an impact the musical genius that is Prince has had. So, if the BET Awards starts to look more like a concert in honor of Prince, we wouldn\u2019t mind\u2026at all\n\n(Also, here's another take on a dream tribute guest list that would have been much better than the tribute we shall never speak of again.)\n\nCypress Moss is what peak Negritude looks like.

Perry built a career on \u201cfixing\u201d black boys. As the title of one of his books, Man Up! Nobody Is Coming to Save Us, suggests, Perry asserts that black folks' salvation is primarily an internal matter. Accordingly, schools (and boot camps) provide close quarters for Perry to recondition youths to have the skills, values and mindsets necessary not to join gangs, leave school early or stay on their mama\u2019s couch.\n\nAccording to Perry\u2019s pull-your-pants-up logic, white achievement should be credited to things that black people \u201cfail\u201d in doing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: Belt wearing isn\u2019t the reason white children are educated in wealthier schools. Haircuts and etiquette classes don\u2019t lead to the technological innovations of Silicon Valley. Lower incarceration rates aren\u2019t because whites use drugs less often. The wage gap isn\u2019t caused by white men\u2019s hard work ethic.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with black children that ending racism can\u2019t solve. In over the 60 years that the National Center for Education Statistics has been collecting data, belt-tightening, haircutting and gangbanging haven\u2019t been remotely cited as causing the categorical educational disparities that currently exist. Prior achievement (low-achieving schools), income and wealth (poverty), along with neighborhood and numerous other factors that have roots in racism continue to plague our communities.\n\nCutting black boys\u2019 hair amounts to nothing powerful, but the animus toward Perry goes far beyond hair. Black folks have grown tired of Perry\u2019s shtick of explaining underachievement by locating the problem within the students, their families and communities\u2014classic cultural-deficit modeling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo clear that there is no recognition of how similar processes have historically been used to force assimilation, dehumanize and devalue culture,\u201d wrote Christopher Emdin, associate professor at Teachers College, Columbia University, on a Facebook post. Bootstrapping is as old as racism itself. Convincing black folks that they are to blame for their existence sustains the legacy of white supremacy.\n\nEven Perry\u2019s response to substantive criticism resorts to blaming.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI often quote Thich Nhat Hanh, who wrote, \u201cWhen you plant lettuce, if it does not grow well, you don\u2019t blame the lettuce. You look into reasons it is not doing well. It may need fertilizer, or more water, or less sun. You never blame the lettuce.\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t cut black boys\u2019 hair to make them more acceptable and nonthreatening to white people, either.\n\nPerry\u2019s tweet, which also referenced the U.S. Army, came eight days after Muhammad Ali\u2019s death. Ali refused Army induction because of his principles and blackness. His life proved that true greatness has nothing to do with conforming to racist structures, and Black Lives Matter is more aligned with his radical, black tradition than Steve Harvey or Steve Perry ever could be.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nActions stemming from blaming never lead to the systemic changes that black folks need; demanding justice does. And throwing shade on the black cultural aesthetic rather than on the actual systems that put black folks in peril is telling.\n\nAs a former charter school executive whose dreads flowed over my doctoral robe, I can tell you that my hair was a problem only for police and black people who felt it wasn\u2019t respectable. I also learned that education reform demanded the kind of conformity that Perry espouses. Firing teachers, suspending kids and blaming parents deems you an effective leader for whom applause and resources follow.\n\nThe outpouring of anger toward Perry\u2019s tweet marks a positive turn in history. For years we\u2019ve allowed school leaders to make our children walk on white lines to prove their worth. From speech to clothes to hair, if they failed to assimilate, any challenges that they faced were because they weren't \"raised right.\" Now we expect our leaders to generate jobs, deconstruct jails, train teachers and provide college scholarship, not place their failure to do so on a lack of haircuts and belts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe notion that traditionally black hairstyles are synonymous with being unsuccessful speaks directly to the pathologizing of blackness that this country is known to do\u2014and our \"leaders\" are too often the ones elevated to do it.\n\nLuckily, black people are smarter than what Perry thinks.\n\nAlso on The Root: \u201c\u2018Crazy Baldheads\u2019 Seek to Eliminate Dreads\u201d", "keywords": ["white", "cutting", "supremacy", "perry", "boys", "aesthetic", "black", "folks", "perrys", "needs", "hair", "teachers", "school", "schools", "steve"], "polarity": -0.014963233113918046, "subjectivity": 0.40185909980430534},

I\u2019m here and your future lucky.\u201d*\n\n-poet Angel Nafis, \u201cGravity\u201d\n\nPart I: Motherhood Changes Everything\n\nOur son, Maze, is a miracle, born to us on May 27 of last year. In 2012, I lost two pregnancies, back to back, one in early January and the other in early April. The first was an ectopic pregnancy. I almost bled to death when the pregnancy ruptured one of my tubes, and if not for an emergency laparoscopy to save my life, I would have. The surgical team removed one liter of blood from my body. The second pregnancy was not ectopic; I just bled and bled until there was no longer any sign of a life in my uterus. Months later, I wrote poems about my experience at the annual Cave Canem poetry retreat where I had just gotten a fellowship. I wrote to heal what felt like an endless wound in my core that was as large as the universe and just as open. I hoped and believed I would have a healthy pregnancy and baby, but the faith was a great risk. To believe was to face the possibility that it could happen again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaze was pulled from me almost a year ago after 32 hours of mostly natural labor that ended in a Cesarean section. He weighed eight pounds and twelve ounces and was 22 inches long. His spindly, toned legs resembled a tiny marathon runner\u2019s more than a newborn infant\u2019s. My husband, David, is 6\u20192\u201d and my father, of whom our son bears a striking resemblance, is 6\u20193\u201d. Maze will be taller than both of them. Our pediatrician recently asked what we were feeding him after he informed us Maze is in the 100th percentile for length among children his age. If you could see him now, you might guess he was at least two years old, not 11 months. He is bigger than most babies I have ever seen, with firm muscle beneath his chubby limbs. He is so strong that recently, while visiting a friend\u2019s house, he picked up a barstool as I picked him up. He is powerful in a way that surprises his father and me. His nose is magnificently flared, and I have plans to write an ode to it. His complexion is the creamy magnificence of the cup of coffee I just drank, and people stop, smile, stare and say how beautiful he is. I have heard, \u201cHe is the cutest baby I have ever seen,\u201d since he was born, and I know people are not lying. Yet he is also inquisitive and so smart that he misses nothing. He sees what we see and what we do not, to the extent that confirms to me the existence of angels. His father and I see greatness in him, as do our friends and family. Though our son cannot yet say this to us and may not even understand it completely, I believe he sees greatness in himself. Even now. Each day, he is affirmed by our love for him, by the community that welcomed him with an overflow of love and expectation.\n\nIf it is true that I had to endure the horrible, ripping-out trauma of two miscarriages within three months of each other as part of my journey to have Maze, I would do it again. I love him like breath, but more than that. I love him enough that I would die if it meant saving his life.\n\nI believe these mothers would, too, along with each mother not listed here who has lost their children due to police brutality and unmerited violence:\n\nSybrina Fulton.\n\nSamaria Rice.\n\nLesley McSpadden.\n\nGloria Darden.\n\nAndrea Irwin.\n\nI have met none of these women. But I do not have to meet them to know they want their sons Trayvon, Tamir, Mike, Freddie, and Tony alive. They want them thriving, successful and to be able to do something sweet for them, to watch them grow at every stage. They want to marvel and remember them as babies, then toddlers. Yet they are mothers without their sons. Senselessly. In the words of Tonya from August Wilson\u2019s King Hedley II, \u201cWho turned the world around like that? What sense that make?\u201d In the monologue, Tonya attempts to make her husband, King, see why she does not want the baby she is carrying. \u201cI\u2019m through with babies\u2026I ain\u2019t raising no kid to have somebody shoot him. To have his friends shoot him. To have police shot him\u2026I don\u2019t want to raise no more babies when you got to fight to keep them alive.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am the mother of a Black baby who will grow into a tall, large Black man\u2014the kind of man the police fear and profile. And sometimes\u2014too often\u2014murder. This is painful to write, acknowledge, consider. It haunts me so much that I have thought more than once about leaving America, the only home I know, the home that does not seem to understand itself unless the blood of young Black men stain the streets and pavement, unless a Black male body breaks in the back of a van, unless a gang of cops strangle a Black man to death. But this is not new. It is a crisis as old as slavery, rooted in its institution. The American flag is stained with Black male blood, over centuries and centuries. If we could see the flag as it is, there would be no white. Only red. Blood red. And soiled, unholy blue.\n\nPart II: Freddie Gray Died on One of the Greatest Days of My Artistic Life\n\nOn Saturday, April 18, David, Maze, and I drove four hours to Washington, DC. The next day, Sunday, April 19, \u201cRise,\u201d my collaboration with brilliant composer and friend Judah Adashi, premiered at the resplendent, historical Metropolitan AME Church in Washington, DC, just a short walk from the White House. \u201cRise\u201d examines fifty years of the Civil Rights movement, from Selma to Ferguson, and includes the great triumphs and pains of freedom fighters, from Martin Luther King, Jr. to Congressman John Lewis and their hope for socio-political freedom and equality for every person breathing in America. Yet the work also tells the story of Black men who have fallen to soon, like seeds that will never sprout, killed by a cop\u2019s bullet. I wrote the poems that Judah composed from the time Maze was sixteen days old until he was six months old. They are my love-song for him, as well as my hope for the nation. After the performance I told Judah that if I were a composer, I would have done exactly what he did with the music, which was beautifully sang by the Cantate Chamber Singers and the exquisite jazz ensemble Afro Blue of Howard University.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe premiere was one of the most powerful events of my career as an artist-writer. There was a positive review of the collaboration and praise for the poems I\u2019d written in The Washington Post, and I\u2019d read the poems with Gwen Ifill, brilliant journalist, newscaster, and author who, as a member of Metropolitan AME, had secured the venue. I was honored to meet her, but any moment to be star struck was struck down when she greeted me with a warm, sincere smile and a comment that we were both wearing blue. Later, we would read the poems together. I felt like the hard work I had put in over the years as a writer was paying off. The \u201cnational platform\u201d I had been striving to hit with every step was being realized, and my words seemed to have meant something to each person who occupied the church that night.\n\nI felt like someone hit me with a car when Judah informed me days later that Freddie Gray died on the same day \u201cRise\u201d premiered. I could see my heart inside my chest, and it was overwhelmed. It was red and swelling with pain and burden. While we were remembering Trayvon, Mike Brown, Amadou and so many others, yet another young Black man lost his heart, lungs, muscles, everything, everything, everything that made him human and therefore worthy of life because cops decided his breath did not mean anything and his beating heart did not mean anything and did not care that he was loved and as such, was someone\u2019s baby. I\u2019d written poems but another Black man was dead.\n\nInstantly, I felt a two-ness. On one hand, why write poems and words about justice, fairness, equality? What difference does it make? On the other: This is exactly why you write and must continue to write poems about the value of Black men, women, children, and families. In her article, \u201cNo Room for Self-Pity, No Room for Fear,\u201d Noble Prize-winning author Toni Morrison asserts, \u201cThis is precisely the time when artists go to work. There is no time for despair, no place for self-pity, no need for silence, no room for fear. We speak, we write, we do language. That is how civilizations heal.\u201d I use my pen and my work to remember, to call forth hope, to call out for change and social transformation. If words are a sword, I want mine to cut deep into that part of America that believes the loss of Black male life is okay; just fine; happens all the time; or is to be expected because that\u2019s what they do. \u201cThey die, don\u2019t they?\u201d And as a writer and mother, my job is to say, NO. NO. NO. They don\u2019t die because we are fighting for them. They are beautiful, brilliant and deserve their breath to stay in their bodies for a long, long time, until they are old men ready to turn to dust or go to heaven or live again as a child, flower, breeze, morning tide, or tree.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPart III. The White House Tulips are Redder than Blood\n\nWhen we arrived in Washington, I did not realize how close we were to the White House until my husband told me. We decided to walk there\u2014to be tourists and take it all in. I wondered if the President and First Lady were inside.\n\nSoon after our feet hit the South Lawn, I caught sight of the gorgeous tulips, put on my red Ray Bans, and took selfies with Maze. I had never seen more beautiful tulips in my life. I was sure these were special tulips. White House tulips. Presidential tulips. Who planted them and made sure they stayed that red? How\u2019d they get that red? Redder than blood? Their stems were straight and long. They were elegant in their precision. Their backs were straight. Their blooms reached high as heaven, like a noble head on the shoulders of a teenaged boy who has all his life before him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn America, we think our greatness is built on our wealth, industry, and military. But I say we are what we are in this country because Black people have not crumbled under the burden of oppression, police brutality, and socio-political disempowerment. I say America is what it is, in part, because we remain. We did not perish. We remain.\n\n1. My Baby Has a Future\n\nSometimes, my husband and I have nightmares of something terrible happening to Maze. It\u2019s every parents\u2018 worst nightmare, isn\u2019t it? Something happening. That\u2019s why we tell them: \u201cLook twice before you cross the street. Hold my hand. Be home before dark. I don\u2019t know them, so you can\u2019t go over to their house.\u201d If you are Black and male, your parents will probably tell you or have already told you, \u201cIf you are stopped by the police, do this, don\u2019t do that.\u201d We want our children safe and alive. We don\u2019t want to bury our children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFaith tells me our son will become an old man and live a deeply satisfied life. Faith keeps me on my feet. Faith is what makes me trust change is coming. (And it helps that Marilyn Mosby\u2014the Maryland state\u2019s attorney for Baltimore City who is razor-sharp, smart, and fearless\u2014charged the six police officers who killed Freddie Gray with murder two days ago and said to the young people rising up in protest, \u201cOur time is now.\u201d) As a Black woman and mother, I need hope to breathe. And I need to write words that perhaps my son will read one day and know how much he has always mattered to me, how very precious his life is.\n\n***\n\n*I love this poem by my friend Angel Nafis, who I met at the Cave Canem poetry retreat in 2012.

He\u2019s so good that although Oklahoma\u2019s Trae Young has a bigger name, Sexton will probably be picked ahead of him in the NBA draft. And while Alabama had an up-and-down season this year, that they even made it to the NCAA tournament was largely due to Sexton\u2019s play in the SEC Tournament.\n\n\n\nAnyway, they lost Saturday to Villanova, a team that\u2019s just much better than them. In a weekend full of upsets, Villanova handling Alabama was one of the few outcomes that most people rightly predicted. During the game, while Alabama was down 26 points, Sexton was called for a technical foul for taunting Villanova\u2019s Mikal Bridges. Obviously, this was not a good look, but 19-year-olds do dumb shit sometimes, and this was far from an unforgivable act.\n\nIt was also last weekend that I learned that 1) Joseph Goodman exists, 2) Joseph Goodman writes things that can be read on the internet and 3) Joseph Goodman is a living icon. If Earth is around for another 10,000 years or so, and if people are still writing about sports on the internet then, you still won\u2019t find another take worse than the one Joseph Goodman wrote on Collin Sexton.\n\nLike, remember that scene from The Matrix when Neo gets shot in the hallway and comes back to life and finally realizes he\u2019s the One and sees everything in code and stops the bullets in midair and Agent Smith rushes him and Neo starts doing some no-look, one-handed kung fu shit while making a face like \u201cThese hoes won\u2019t hold me back!\u201d and then dives into Agent Smith\u2019s chest? Well, this piece is Joesph Goodman diving into the internet\u2019s chest.\n\nIt starts with something fact-ish and smarmy, a narrative device to let everyone know that Goodman is coming from a rational and sober place. JOSEPH GOODMAN IS A MOTHERFUCKING ADULT:\n\nCollin Sexton\u2019s final action as a college basketball player was getting hit with a technical foul for taunting a superior opponent while trailing by 26 points.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen he begins his descent into full dog-whistling schoolmarm:\n\nNot exactly the last impression someone wants to make before turning pro, and probably not the type of image the University of Alabama wants to project to the rest of the country after making it back to the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2012.\n\nI\u2019m sure the state of Alabama has some bigger concerns about the image they wish to project to the rest of the country, but maybe that\u2019s just me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, Alabama made it back to the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2012 BECAUSE OF COLLIN SEXTON, THE STAR FRESHMAN POINT GUARD YOU\u2019RE ABOUT TO PLAY MAGA YAHTZEE WITH IN THIS FUCKING \u201cCOLUMN,\u201d YOU DICKWAD! Goodman goes on:\n\nClassless. Clueless. Unacceptable.\n\nHoly shit! Goodman brought out the big guns. Whenever you compose entire paragraphs with just one word, you mean business. Someone call the manager because some serious white business is about to go down. Joseph Goodman is here to write shitty takes and chew bubble gum, and he\u2019s out of bubble gum:\n\nSo, Alabama\u2019s one-and-done point guard took a seat on the bench and watched the final few minutes of his brief college career from the sidelines. Credit to Alabama coach Avery Johnson for at least getting that right on Saturday in Pittsburgh. From the bench, Sexton got a good look at what it must feel like to watch Alabama pummel, say, Coastal Carolina inside Bryant-Denny Stadium on a Saturday in the fall. Only worse. At least Nick Saban is nice enough not to run up the score on the sacrificial lambs of college football. Villanova isn\u2019t wiring $1.5 million into Alabama\u2019s bank account on Monday morning, either.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou probably have to be a seasoned reader of shitty sports takes to see what\u2019s happening here. Although the athletes in power-conference football and basketball are predominately black, basketball is generally regarded as a blacker sport. One of the reasons for this distinction is that basketball generally allows for more individual freedom and improvisation than football does. And by creating this useless juxtaposition of Collin Sexton and the University of Alabama\u2019s football team, Goodman is reminding the readers that football in general and Nick Saban (Alabama\u2019s football coach) specifically wouldn\u2019t allow such indecency.\n\nJoseph Goodman is a pillowcase filled with blueberries.\n\nGoodman follows with some more bullshit and then (finally) gets to the climax. From this point on, we should probably just start calling \u201cexcessive foreplay\u201d \u201cpulling a Joseph Goodman\u201d:\n\nOne, Alabama should be better this time next year. Yes, Sexton will be gone, but that doesn\u2019t seem like such a bad thing after watching him against a truly special team. Alabama wants to win a national championship in basketball. That doesn\u2019t happen with a 6-foot-2 point guard who wants to play isolation basketball when things get tough. Sexton wouldn\u2019t say definitively that he was going pro after Alabama\u2019s loss, but his body language screamed it at the end of regulation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAh yes. We all know that you can\u2019t win national championships with a player talented and driven and confident enough to score 38 points in a game where his team only had three players. Nope. A college basketball team with national-championship aspirations can\u2019t use players like that. Maybe if Collin Sexton wants to help the team, he\u2019d be better served selling hot sausages in the tailgate instead of playing on the court.\n\nThe rest of the piece is dumb and stupid and shitty and full of dog whistles and just reiterates what Goodman said already. The irony here is that as wrong as Goodman is, he might be right about Alabama. Next year, when Collin Sexton is in the NBA, they might be even better. But they\u2019ll be better because the returning players will be better, with another year to grow and gel. Not because their best player is gone.\n\nAnyway, Joseph Goodman is a columnist for Alabama Media Group. He\u2019s on Twitter @JoeGoodmanJr. And I know all of this because it\u2019s attached to the end of the piece, and it\u2019s the only part that makes any sense.

He\u2019s so good that although Oklahoma\u2019s Trae Young has a bigger name, Sexton will probably be picked ahead of him in the NBA draft. And while Alabama had an up-and-down season this year, that they even made it to the NCAA tournament was largely due to Sexton\u2019s play in the SEC Tournament.\n\n\n\nAnyway, they lost Saturday to Villanova, a team that\u2019s just much better than them. In a weekend full of upsets, Villanova handling Alabama was one of the few outcomes that most people rightly predicted. During the game, while Alabama was down 26 points, Sexton was called for a technical foul for taunting Villanova\u2019s Mikal Bridges. Obviously, this was not a good look, but 19-year-olds do dumb shit sometimes, and this was far from an unforgivable act.\n\nIt was also last weekend that I learned that 1) Joseph Goodman exists, 2) Joseph Goodman writes things that can be read on the internet and 3) Joseph Goodman is a living icon. If Earth is around for another 10,000 years or so, and if people are still writing about sports on the internet then, you still won\u2019t find another take worse than the one Joseph Goodman wrote on Collin Sexton.\n\nLike, remember that scene from The Matrix when Neo gets shot in the hallway and comes back to life and finally realizes he\u2019s the One and sees everything in code and stops the bullets in midair and Agent Smith rushes him and Neo starts doing some no-look, one-handed kung fu shit while making a face like \u201cThese hoes won\u2019t hold me back!\u201d and then dives into Agent Smith\u2019s chest? Well, this piece is Joesph Goodman diving into the internet\u2019s chest.\n\nIt starts with something fact-ish and smarmy, a narrative device to let everyone know that Goodman is coming from a rational and sober place. JOSEPH GOODMAN IS A MOTHERFUCKING ADULT:\n\nCollin Sexton\u2019s final action as a college basketball player was getting hit with a technical foul for taunting a superior opponent while trailing by 26 points.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen he begins his descent into full dog-whistling schoolmarm:\n\nNot exactly the last impression someone wants to make before turning pro, and probably not the type of image the University of Alabama wants to project to the rest of the country after making it back to the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2012.\n\nI\u2019m sure the state of Alabama has some bigger concerns about the image they wish to project to the rest of the country, but maybe that\u2019s just me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, Alabama made it back to the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2012 BECAUSE OF COLLIN SEXTON, THE STAR FRESHMAN POINT GUARD YOU\u2019RE ABOUT TO PLAY MAGA YAHTZEE WITH IN THIS FUCKING \u201cCOLUMN,\u201d YOU DICKWAD! Goodman goes on:\n\nClassless. Clueless. Unacceptable.\n\nHoly shit! Goodman brought out the big guns. Whenever you compose entire paragraphs with just one word, you mean business. Someone call the manager because some serious white business is about to go down. Joseph Goodman is here to write shitty takes and chew bubble gum, and he\u2019s out of bubble gum:\n\nSo, Alabama\u2019s one-and-done point guard took a seat on the bench and watched the final few minutes of his brief college career from the sidelines. Credit to Alabama coach Avery Johnson for at least getting that right on Saturday in Pittsburgh. From the bench, Sexton got a good look at what it must feel like to watch Alabama pummel, say, Coastal Carolina inside Bryant-Denny Stadium on a Saturday in the fall. Only worse. At least Nick Saban is nice enough not to run up the score on the sacrificial lambs of college football. Villanova isn\u2019t wiring $1.5 million into Alabama\u2019s bank account on Monday morning, either.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou probably have to be a seasoned reader of shitty sports takes to see what\u2019s happening here. Although the athletes in power-conference football and basketball are predominately black, basketball is generally regarded as a blacker sport. One of the reasons for this distinction is that basketball generally allows for more individual freedom and improvisation than football does. And by creating this useless juxtaposition of Collin Sexton and the University of Alabama\u2019s football team, Goodman is reminding the readers that football in general and Nick Saban (Alabama\u2019s football coach) specifically wouldn\u2019t allow such indecency.\n\nJoseph Goodman is a pillowcase filled with blueberries.\n\nGoodman follows with some more bullshit and then (finally) gets to the climax. From this point on, we should probably just start calling \u201cexcessive foreplay\u201d \u201cpulling a Joseph Goodman\u201d:\n\nOne, Alabama should be better this time next year. Yes, Sexton will be gone, but that doesn\u2019t seem like such a bad thing after watching him against a truly special team. Alabama wants to win a national championship in basketball. That doesn\u2019t happen with a 6-foot-2 point guard who wants to play isolation basketball when things get tough. Sexton wouldn\u2019t say definitively that he was going pro after Alabama\u2019s loss, but his body language screamed it at the end of regulation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAh yes. We all know that you can\u2019t win national championships with a player talented and driven and confident enough to score 38 points in a game where his team only had three players. Nope. A college basketball team with national-championship aspirations can\u2019t use players like that. Maybe if Collin Sexton wants to help the team, he\u2019d be better served selling hot sausages in the tailgate instead of playing on the court.\n\nThe rest of the piece is dumb and stupid and shitty and full of dog whistles and just reiterates what Goodman said already. The irony here is that as wrong as Goodman is, he might be right about Alabama. Next year, when Collin Sexton is in the NBA, they might be even better. But they\u2019ll be better because the returning players will be better, with another year to grow and gel. Not because their best player is gone.\n\nAnyway, Joseph Goodman is a columnist for Alabama Media Group. He\u2019s on Twitter @JoeGoodmanJr. And I know all of this because it\u2019s attached to the end of the piece, and it\u2019s the only part that makes any sense.

The discussion had all of us analyzing our stances on various things, including who pays for dates, who should be the breadwinner in the relationship, and whether or not it is OK for a woman to propose marriage to her male partner.\n\nThese may all seem like simple questions to answer, but there are variables that go along with them\u2014variables that can make people\u2019s answers differ based on who they are in a relationship with, how long the relationship has been going on, and whether or not they can see a long-term future with the person involved.\n\nWho pays on a date?\n\nWhen you go out on a date, who pays\u2014the man or the woman?\n\nI will admit that I am a traditionalist on this one. In casual dating, I generally expect that if I am going out with a man, he is going to pay for the date. I always have my own money when I go out, as a rule, but when the check comes, I sit still and allow him to take it. How he handles the check situation will likely play a big role in determining whether or not I will go out with him again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf he attempts to avoid looking at the check, waits to see if I will grab it first or even suggests that we split, he gets the side eye from me. That\u2019s just how it is. If you ask me to go out with you, I am assuming that you are paying, or else why ask?\n\nThere are folks who say the exception to this rule is if the woman asks for the date, and on that I can agree\u2014so I don\u2019t ask men out on dates, because I don\u2019t want to be in the position of paying in a casual dating situation.\n\nI feel differently if I am in a long-term situation with someone.\n\nIn those types of scenarios, I am more inclined to offer to split the bill or just pay the bill outright sometimes because we have a bigger involvement than just casually seeing each other. I am more invested in the relationship, and therefore more invested in the person, so splitting the check or taking turns paying makes more sense to me\u2014especially in cases where I make more money than my partner.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs it acceptable for a woman to be the breadwinner in the relationship?\n\nMen are traditionally seen as being providers and therefore the breadwinners in a relationship, but what happens when that is not the case? Are we comfortable with the idea of a woman making the most money? Can relationships work when a woman is the provider?\n\nI have had this scenario happen more than once in my adult life, and it was always uncomfortable, for a number of reasons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMen have a sense of pride that is unrivaled by anything else, really. Their egos can often drive them toward behavior that is harmful and even destructive.\n\nI found this to be the case in a previous relationship in which I made more money. Not being able to afford the things that I liked made him feel some type of way. Having his \u201cgirl\u201d pay for things that he felt he should have been paying for made him feel some type of way. My not necessarily needing him for financial or material things made him feel some type of way. It was exhausting.\n\nThe other side of the game is complacency. There are some men who are already generally unmotivated, and having a woman who has her own money and can afford to do things not just for herself but for them as a couple can lead to him never wanting more for himself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy should he, when she can do everything anyway? It\u2019s crazy, but it happens.\n\nWhat this has shown me is that in long-term situations, I need a man who is evenly yoked with me. It just creates less complications and less confusion.\n\nCould there be exceptions to this? Absolutely, and when I run across them, I will tell you. Until then, if it comes down to a choice of me being the breadwinner or me being by myself, I\u2019m going to choose self each and every time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs it OK for a woman to propose?\n\nThe idea that only a man should propose marriage is heavily steeped in patriarchy and the romantic ideals we have been sold by the capitalist spending program known as the wedding industry.\n\nIf a woman loves her man and wants to ask him to marry her, why shouldn\u2019t she be able to? It doesn\u2019t take anything away from him if she does.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe worst he can do is say no, and it\u2019s the same risk a man takes in asking a woman.\n\nOf the three topics we discussed, this is the one I couldn\u2019t really wrap my head around, because I didn\u2019t understand what the big deal was. Why can\u2019t a woman propose? If there is a valid argument for why she shouldn\u2019t, I have yet to hear it.\n\nMy stance on this is that it doesn\u2019t matter who pops the question if both people are in love and want to move forward with the relationship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsk, answer and do what you will with it.\n\nEven in the 21st century, gender roles play a big part in how we deal with our romantic relationships.

Cox (Getty Images)\n\nI probably watched less college basketball this year than I ever have. Actually, \u201cprobably\u201d is unnecessary. That is definitely true. For someone as obsessed with basketball as I am, this might seem odd. But I have a few perfectly rational reasons for this lack of viewership:\n\nThe second draft of my book is due soon, which means that some days I\u2019m working from 9:30 a.m.-ish to 5 p.m.-ish (on VSB stuff) and then from 9 p.m.-ish to 2 a.m.-ish (on book stuff).\n\nThe team that\u2019s usually my favorite to watch (the University of Pittsburgh) might have been the worst team in major Division I basketball this year.\n\nI\u2019m playing basketball three times a week now.\n\nMy nephew is the starting point guard for his high school team, and I\u2019ve been to several of his games.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyway, I\u2019ve watched enough to have a general idea of who is good, and I know enough to know who the top NBA prospects are. So when I filled out my bracket this year, I went with Arizona\u2014the team that has the best NBA prospect (DeAndre Ayton) and three other players (Rawle Alkins, Dusan Ristic and maybe Allonzo Trier) who might be in the league.\n\nAnd then Arizona got blown the fuck out.\n\nUsually, when a lower seed beats a high seed that\u2019s thought to be a title contender, it\u2019s because the lower-seeded team shot the lights out. Or the higher-seeded team couldn\u2019t hit shit. Or maybe the game showed that the teams were actually a bit more equal than the seeds would suggest. But Buffalo beat Arizona like they were a No. 1 seed and Arizona was a 16. They didn\u2019t just beat them. They punked them. In the last five minutes of the game, Arizona just gave up. It was such a display that even though it ruined my bracket, I was rooting for Buffalo to run up the score.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd now, the day after that\u2014and the day after Trae Young was knocked out, too\u2014I want everyone\u2019s brackets to be as fucked as mine is. I want UMBC to beat Virginia and Bucknell to spank Michigan State. I want Charleston to do the Charleston on y\u2019all\u2019s brackets\u2019 grills. I want to see Texas Southern and Trae Jefferson (my new favorite player in college basketball) in the championship game.\n\n(Also, if you have a minute, watch these clips of Jefferson in high school. You won\u2019t be disappointed.)\n\nBefore Arizona lost, I was normal and well-adjusted Damon. I was Damon with dreams and goals and a savings account. I was Damon who intentionally ate some kale yesterday because I knew I needed something green in my system.

No one gets any work done anyway, he said, so why not just give everyone those two days off? This was not the first and will not be the last time I'll hear someone make a similar joke. March Madness will have such a grip on our country in the next couple of weeks that, while it'll never, ever, ever happen, it's not completely illogical to give everyone a few days off of work. The joke is also accidentally apropos. What better, more American way to honor this annual celebration of athletes working for free than to not work and still get paid?\n\nAh yes. You knew it was coming. Just as the NCAA tournament receives our national focus, this is also the time of the year where the discussion about student-athletes getting paid reaches a critical mass. It often goes the same way. A smart take on the NCAA will publish on The Atlantic or Grantland or Deadspin. The ridiculous amount of money made from the NCAA tournament (not sure of the exact amount, but I think it's roughly $17 trillion an hour) will get cited, as well as all the people making millions (the schools, the coaches, the school administrations, etc) off of the labor of the athletes who see none of that cash. Sure, the piece will also note, athletes get a free college education. But then it'll also include the fact that saying \"Hey, we gave you something that's worth $40,000 for free!\" while cashing a $17 trillion dollar check is like, I don't know, someone saying \"A tsunami is about to hit our island. Can you help?\" and someone else saying \"Well, here's an umbrella.\" Also, the piece will cite the numerous academic scandals at high profile universities as more proof that many of these trillion dollar check cashing schools have no interest in making sure their athletes actually receive an education. It might even mention that \"four year scholarships\" are actually one year renewable. Meaning that an athlete's scholarship can get revoked after one year for any reason. And, if it mentions that, it might cite example of athletes dropped from their scholarships because of injury or because the coach just needed an extra scholarship to give to someone else.\n\nSome people will listen to this conversation and agree that this is an injustice. They'll concede that student-athletes are being exploited and should be allowed to receive some sort of compensation for their work. We'll call these people Group A. Today, as these types of conversations about the NCAA seem to be more prevalent, Group A seems to be growing. I don't have any numbers in front of me, but it feels like there are more people in 2015 in favor of student-athletes receiving compensation than there would have been in 1995.\n\nHowever, three groups still remain strong.\n\nGroup B: The people who agree that student-athletes are being exploited, but just don't give a fuck.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGroup C: The people who do not agree that student-athletes are being exploited, and believe that a free college education is acceptable compensation. They also don't give a fuck, but their don't-give-a-fuckness is principle-driven.\n\nGroup D: The people who stand to profit from the NCAA's current economic model, and do not want any change.\n\nOf these, Group D is both the most hypocritical and the most understandable. If your income is directly tied to other's lack of income, it makes perfect sense why you'd be invested in the status quo. Group B and Group C, however, make less sense. Especially when considering that these are often otherwise intelligent and thoughtful people who recognize inequality and injustice in other ways but, for whatever reason, have a blind spot when it comes to college athletes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, it makes less logical sense. Emotional sense, however, is different. And this is where the blind spot comes from.\n\nAlthough there are dozens of NCAA sports, football and men's basketball are the ones at the center of this conversation. NCAA football and men's basketball teams are filled with 18 to 22 year old young men. Many of whom are Black, some of whom would not be anywhere close to a college campus if not for sports, and all of whom were stars in high school and are likely among the preferred class of students in college. Being part of the preferred class of college students means they receive lots of perks; some social (women, automatic elevated social status, etc) and some academic (free books, better meal plans, first dibs with class and dorm selections, etc). And, on top of that, they go to school for free! Basically, their lives seem to be much better than the lives of 99% of college students. And, because their lives seem to be much better than the lives of 99% of college students, some people \u2014 often people who were part of that 99% \u2014 have a very difficult time conjuring much sympathy for any type of \"injustice\" they might be facing.\n\nWhen you think about this, it makes sense why some of these same people could refuse to buy Nikes or shop at Walmart because of how they treat their workforce, but have no fucks left to give about college athletes getting exploited. It's the exact same concept, the only difference being that the Walmart workers and the people in the Nike sweatshops are presumed to be poor and powerless while supporting NCAA reform means you're basically saying that you're in favor of this 6'3, 220 pound superstar athlete with free classes, free tutors, free food, free pussy, and free social status also getting paid. But, that only difference is a huge fucking difference. Maybe not logically. But emotionally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the bright side, March is already halfway over. Which means we're all a couple weeks away from giving absolutely no fucks about this conversation for another 11 months. In the mean time, fill out those brackets.

Defensive back Marlon Humphrey was there allegedly visiting the University of Alabama (nice alibi), where he played football until he was drafted in the first round by the Ravens. Despite his $11 million football contract, Humphrey needed more, and that\u2019s when he put his criminal plan into action.\n\nAl.com reports that around 2 a.m., Humphrey used his phone to request an Uber. When the car arrived, Humphrey entered the car with two women and went to a local hotel. Reports do not indicate whether the women were used as accomplices to distract the \u201cmark\u201d while Humphrey\u2019s devious plan unfurled, but I\u2019ve seen Ocean\u2019s Eleven at least two or three times, so I know how these things work.\n\nThe football player asked his driver for a cellphone charger, and the driver complied. When they arrived at the destination, that\u2019s when Humphrey struck. (And by \u201cstruck\u201d I mean he simply exited the car with the cellphone charger.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe detailed police report indicates that the driver tried to get the charger back, but that\u2019s when the professional athlete attacked the hapless, unwitting 30-year-old driver and unleashed the fire and fury of a million beasts. The driver was assaulted with an unrelenting barrage until he finally escaped, reporting absolutely no injuries. (Slightly pushing someone away with your elbow can be described as an \u201cunrelenting barrage,\u201d right?) The driver did say that Humphrey balled up his fist but didn\u2019t hit or swing at him ... like a savage!\n\nThe Uber driver, now with no cellphone charger to call his own, went to the Tuscaloosa Police Department and filed charges. Humphrey was on the lam for days, evading capture until he was apprehended by eagle-eyed officers who spotted him inside the police station trying to turn himself in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe was booked in the Tuscaloosa County Jail on a $2,500 bond. The star is charged with third-degree robbery and harassment.\n\n\u201cMarlon is saddened by this because he knows it\u2019s an honest mistake,\u201d Humphrey\u2019s attorney, Paul Patterson, said. \u201cHe\u2019s confused and perplexed as to how an Uber driver could go down and be able to secure a warrant for his arrest over something so simple and innocent. He realizes there are individuals out there who will not believe his side of the story, but fortunately, we have eyewitnesses that will support our position 100 percent.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m just glad we can keep these kinds of thugs off the streets. Police officers are probably still searching for Humphrey\u2019s contact on the cellphone-charger black market. If law enforcement officers let this go, then none of our cellphone chargers are safe.

There\u2019s no excuse. I did something really bad,\u201d she said.\n\nYes, Harley. You did something really stupid and bad. The internet is forever. Good luck finding a job in the future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUpdated Wednesday, Jan. 17, 2018, 3:05 p.m. EST: It appears that there are some consequences for white racists after all.\n\nHarley Barber has been kicked out of Alpha Phi sorority after her racist Instagram rant went viral Tuesday.\n\nLinda Kahangi\u2014who is the executive director of Alpha Phi International Women\u2019s Fraternity\u2014said the following in a statement Tuesday evening:\n\nAlpha Phi is a diverse, values-based organization and condemns the language and opinions in these videos. They are offensive and hateful to both our own members and to other members of the Greek and campus community. The Beta Mu chapter leadership and supporting alumnae moved quickly to address the offense, and Ms. Barber is no longer a member of Alpha Phi.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes. Diverse. Someone in the comments drew my attention to the fact that the University of Alabama Alpha Phi chapter is the same sorority that was guilty of this video a few years ago:\n\nThat totally looks very diverse. Some of them are even brunettes.\n\nAnyway, waiting for the U of A to send Harley back to Marlton, N.J., on the fastest thing smoking. Hit me up when that happens.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarlier:\n\nDid you know that if you are from New Jersey but go to college down South\u2014say, in Alabama\u2014you can use the n-word as much as you want? Even if it\u2019s Martin Luther King Jr. Day? I had no idea, but thankfully, a University of Alabama sorority girl was here to educate me.\n\nAccording to her Facebook page (and her inflammatory and racist Instagram video), Harley Barber is from Marlton, N.J. She is a student at the University of Alabama, where she is also a member of Alpha Phi sorority. She has always wanted to be a member of that sorority, ever since she was in high school.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom what I can gather from her Instagram video, someone told Barber\u2019s sorority that she might be a little bit racist. It is possible that the sorority pulled Barber to the side about it, because the result is a 56-second Instagram video in which she rants about someone trying to snitch on her to her sorority and about how, since she was now down South, she could say the word \u201cnigger\u201d as much as she wanted.\n\nTwo videos from Barber\u2019s alleged \u201cFinstagram\u201d (fake Instagram) were posted to Twitter by Twitter user @TabisBack.\n\nIn the first video, Barber encounters a faucet running, wasting water. She turns off the water and says, \u201cWe don\u2019t waste water because of people in Syria.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe then says, \u201cI love how I act like I love black people because I fucking hate niggers, so that\u2019s really interesting. I fucking hate niggers, but I just saved the fucking niggers by shutting that water off.\u201d\n\nShe then sings, \u201cJump on it. Jump on this. Jump on this\u201d and adds, \u201cImma probably jump on your man with my \u2026 \u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the second video, she says:\n\nI\u2019ve wanted to be an Alpha Phi since I was fucking in high school and nobody fucking understands how much I love Alpha Phi. And now someone wants to say I\u2019m offensive because I said \u201cnigger\u201d? You know what? Nigger, nigger, nigger. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s Martin Luther King Day. Nigger, nigger, nigger. I\u2019m in the South now, bitch. So everyone can fuck off. I\u2019m from New Jersey, so I can say \u201cnigger\u201d as much as I want. Nigger, nigger, nigger. And if anyone else wants to fucking snake me on my fucking Finsta for saying nigger?\n\nHer rant was supported by a crowd of seemingly drunken white sorority girls who laugh and appear to be cheering her on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the University of Alabama was tagged on the tweet, it responded with a tweet of its own disavowing Barber\u2019s rant.\n\n\u201cThese remarks are ignorant and disturbing and in no way reflect the values of The University of Alabama. This unfortunate behavior has been reported to the Office of Student Conduct as it does not align with the community expectations of students at the Capstone,\u201d the university wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlpha Phi, a sorority that touts itself as \u201ca sisterhood of outstanding women supporting one another in lifelong achievement,\u201d has yet to make a statement on its member\u2019s actions.\n\nIf the Donald Trump presidency has done anything for this country, it has emboldened racists and made them feel as though they don\u2019t have to hide anymore. So now we get these racist videos with people showing their faces and their real attitudes.\n\nWe\u2019ll see if either the University of Alabama or Alpha Phi does anything about this.", "keywords": ["white", "video", "alpha", "fucking", "girl", "university", "nigger", "racist", "instagram", "phi", "sorority", "kicked", "rant", "alabama", "videos", "barber"], "polarity": -0.03328886610465555, "subjectivity": 0.49571937419305834},

That\u2019s the question some have pondered since the election of Jared Hunter as student president at the University of Alabama.\n\n\n\nWhile many praised his victory as a symbol of progress\u2014the 21-year-old junior being only the third black student to win the student government presidency in 54 years since the school began admitting black students\u2014many other students, especially black students, were skeptical.\n\nParticularly because Hunter had the backing of \u201cthe Machine.\u201d\n\nA secret society that has long dominated campus politics and social life, the Machine has an infamous history when it comes to race relations.\n\nOfficially named Theta Nu Epsilon, the Machine is a 100-year-old secret society made up of a select group of traditionally white fraternities and sororities that has long pulled the strings of campus politics, at times with allegedly coercive tactics. Not only is it a powerful force on the university campus, but it has historically served as a training ground for local and national politicians. Just a few years ago, the elite group was accused of rigging a local school board election to benefit a UA alum.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThus, while the president of UA\u2019s National Pan-Hellenic Council (the governing body of black fraternities and sororities) endorsed Hunter in a campaign video, black Greeks have generally been quiet about his victory.\n\nShelby Norman, a senior and member of the largest black sorority on campus, Alpha Kappa Alpha, said that student elections are just not a priority for Alabama\u2019s black Greek-letter organizations, which are more focused on community involvement off campus.\n\nClearly, though, that wasn\u2019t the only reason she and her friends weren\u2019t out celebrating.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe Machine candidate doesn\u2019t make progress. It just shows the Machine continually manipulating,\u201d added Norman, who didn\u2019t support Hunter because she felt he downplayed the Machine\u2019s racist past. \u201cIt was very saddening for the minority community. I was let down.\u201d\n\nHunter has done little press since his election, and declined my numerous requests for an interview. But he went public about the Machine\u2019s endorsement a week before the election and promised to act independently: \u201cThe Machine\u2019s stigma casts a shadow on the history of this university to this day. I wrestled with the dilemma\u2014and eventually realized I had an incredible opportunity. I knew my campaign and my ideas were my own. No matter who chose to support me, I would run on my own terms,\u201d he wrote in the school paper, the Crimson White.\n\nThat didn\u2019t do much to assuage those skeptical of the hoopla around his win. Within the responses of the many Alabama students with whom I spoke, were the echoes of black Americans\u2019 reactions to political firsts on the national stage: How many times has the election of a black official been heralded as a signal of change\u2014regardless of whether the institution behind the win has shown any intention of tackling the systemic discrimination many African Americans still face?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo paraphrase the title of The Root contributor Michael Arceneaux\u2019s essay back in 2014 following the election of Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) and Rep. Mia Love (R-Utah): Black wins may be historic, but they\u2019re not (necessarily) progress.\n\nArceneaux maintained that Love and Scott could succeed precisely \u201cbecause they are black faces to political views typically associated with white men.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat may not be the case with Hunter. The first African-American member of UA\u2019s chapter of Theta Chi, he carried 54 percent of the vote in the three-candidate race and vowed to foster inclusion and promote transparency in student elections. But in helping elect him, the Machine seems to have continued to employ the tactics that often prevent independent students from succeeding in campus politics by rallying Greek students to support one of their own instead. According to a recent expos\u00e9 by the Crimson White, the Machine threatens to jeopardize the social life of fraternities, sororities and their members if they don\u2019t follow the secret society\u2019s wishes.\n\n\n\nFitzgerald Mosley is a UA senior and student organizer for the campus civil rights group BamaSits. He was disappointed by the Machine\u2019s imprint on the new president\u2019s campaign, describing Hunter\u2019s decision to run with the Machine\u2019s support as \u201ca question mark,\u201d adding, \u201cIt didn\u2019t sit right with the community.\u201d\n\nAnd he had a more concrete bone to pick with Hunter\u2019s election: allegations about campaign violations (not infrequently made against the Machine\u2019s candidate), which, in Mosley\u2019s eyes, should have disqualified Hunter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarly this year, the UA\u2019s Elections Board (pdf) found that Hunter\u2019s campaign went over the spending limit and paid a $500 tab for students at a kickoff party. On its website, the board also urged students to come forward and give information about the Machine.\n\nThe Office of Student Conduct said it is currently investigating Hunter and additional allegations concerning several groups and individuals who may have \u201ctampered or interfered with the SGA election process.\u201d The university\u2019s Elections Board has cited the Machine\u2019s endorsement and Hunter\u2019s failure to complete community service as possible campaign violations, and has urged the Office of Student Conduct to consider all sanctions, including Hunter losing his right to serve.\n\nIn a Crimson White article, Hunter\u2019s campaign manager, Caitlin Cobb, said that the UA\u2019s Elections Board unfairly targeted her candidate. \u201cThe number of emails we received from the Elections Board, some totally frivolous, combined with the many times our team was called to appear before them was unlike any [investigation] the University has seen before,\u201d she wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA university spokesperson told me that Hunter\u2019s term has not yet ended and the university cannot speculate \u201con the potential outcomes of future decisions that will be based on future findings.\u201d\n\nBlack students on campus aren\u2019t the only ones wondering how much the election reflects any real change in the Machine\u2019s philosophy. For many students, the election was less about Hunter as a candidate than about the Machine\u2019s effort to keep up with changing social and political dynamics on campus.\n\n\u201cThe fact that even the Machine has to run an African American for president speaks about the progress the university has made in the last couple of years,\u201d said Josh Shumate, a white student who helps lead a campus watchdog organization that monitors UA elections called the United Alabama Project.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs I helped report in Fusion TV\u2019s investigative documentary The Naked Truth: Frat Power, the Machine has a dismal record when it comes to its relations with black Alabama students: from burning crosses, to protesting the election of the first black student government president in the 1970s, to viciously threatening candidates, to fighting student efforts to integrate UA\u2019s Greek system as recently as 2014.\n\nThe Machine has adapted over the years, especially when its power has been under threat. In 2013, allegations surfaced that traditionally white sororities were blocking black women from joining. Sorority women were first allowed to join the secret society in the 1970s right after they voted against the Machine candidate and helped to elect the first black student government president. In 2016, the group reportedly supported a white sorority woman for executive office, which students say is very rare, after the Machine candidate lost the presidency once again to an independent African-American student.\n\nIn response to years of allegations about discrimination, since 2013, Alabama has developed an action plan, with the assistance of the U.S. Department of Justice, to increase diversity in traditionally white Greek-letter organizations. By fall of 2016, there were 104 black students in white fraternities and sororities. That\u2019s less than 1 percent of the total membership, but more than 16 times the number of black members five years ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe change reflects calls for more diversity within the Greek system at other big Greek schools like Vanderbilt (pdf) and Stanford universities. According to University of Connecticut Associate Professor Matthew Hughey, who has studied race relations in America for more than two decades, people of color make up only about 4 percent or 5 percent of Greek organizations\u2019 membership nationwide.\n\nHughey is also wary of reading too much social change into Hunter\u2019s win. \u201cI don\u2019t know how an elite, secret anti-democratic white power organization backing a black candidate is a sign of progress,\u201d he told me. \u201cThey were the elite of the already elite, and they were used as vehicles to retain power and prestige. They are functioning as they were designed to function.\u201d\n\nHughey said that Americans have a tendency to focus on the exceptions, citing the election of the country\u2019s first black U.S. senator, Hiram Revels, in the 1800s. \u201cAt the time, people claimed that his election to Congress represented the end of racism,\u201d he said. \u201c[White] people were arguing the same with the election of President Obama, and they are going to do the same with Hunter. You have these black faces in high places without any actual changes in the system.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimilar prognostics about broader change were made when Michael Steele became the first African-American chairman of the Republican Party in 2009.\n\nThe discussions around inclusion that Hunter\u2019s election has sparked go beyond race. While Greek students represent less than 40 percent of UA\u2019s undergraduate student body, fraternity and sorority members hold most of the executive and senatorial positions in student government\u2014many thanks to the Machine\u2019s support.\n\n\u201cThey have an automatic voting bloc that preclude [non-Greek] students from participating,\u201d Jordan LaPorta, news editor of the Crimson White, who says that Greek power also excludes people from student government on the basis of socioeconomic status.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is undeniable power in Hunter\u2019s election, in seeing a black face at the helm of the student body at an institution like Alabama. The Root contributor Andre Perry has written about how having a black president of the United States showed his 5-year-old son that \u201che, too, could become POTUS.\u201d Sometimes one person can make a big difference. Obama had the most diverse Cabinet in recent history, and issues like criminal-justice reform and racial disparity became central topics for his administration.\n\nAnd yet, as the oft-cited Zora Neale Hurston quote goes, \u201cAll my skinfolk ain\u2019t kinfolk.\u201d\n\nAmanda Bennett, an African-American graduate student who organized anti-discrimination protests in 2015, said she is willing to give Hunter the benefit of the doubt. She agrees that his election is a symbol of change, adding: \u201cOnly time will tell if it\u2019s a symbol of progress, and if the Greek system is really adapting to modern times.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConnie Fossi is an Emmy-nominated and award-winning investigative producer at Fusion with special skills in politics, criminal justice and immigration.", "keywords": ["white", "students", "face", "count", "university", "progress", "election", "black", "hunters", "machine", "student", "machines", "does", "ala", "hunter", "place"], "polarity": 0.048210222317365124, "subjectivity": 0.38042310863739426},

I absolutely get that jobs are scarce and nice checks for those who truly \u201cstarted from the bottom, now we\u2019re here\u201d are extremely rare. But sometimes, wanting to stay out of the unemployment line can go too far. Just think about how many people you know who have checked out at their jobs because it\u2019s just easier to go along to get along.\n\n\n\nSo when I attended the Atlanta Hawks\u2019 diversity-inclusion symposium, MOSAIC (Model of Shaping Atlanta Through Inclusive Conversations), last week, I really expected Hill to continue walking the \u201cjust trying to keep my job\u201d tone of her statement. In my experience, many companies do these events just to look like they\u2019re doing something. Rarely are real issues even touched. The conversation usually reinforces what companies want to hear and not what employees of color\u2014black employees especially\u2014really experience, which is everything but diverse and inclusive. Plus, given MOSAIC\u2019s origins, I just didn\u2019t expect to hear anything out of the norm.\n\n\n\nMOSAIC, which you\u2019ve probably never heard of before now, is one of the initiatives the Atlanta Hawks created in response to their own racist mini scandal back in 2014, when racially disparaging comments from Danny Ferry\u2014the former Duke standout (enough said)\u2014and emails from then-Hawks co-owner Bruce Levenson surfaced. Ferry\u2019s comments centered on NBA forward Luol Deng\u2019s African heritage, while Levenson\u2019s emails basically argued that Hawks fans were too black and \u201cthat the black crowd scared away the whites and there are simply not enough affluent black fans to build a sign[i]ficant season ticket base.\u201d\n\n\n\nToday there\u2019s a new ownership group with former Duke and NBA player Grant Hill as a partner. Plus they hired Nzinga \u201cZing\u201d Shaw, as the NBA\u2019s first-ever chief diversity and inclusion officer. They\u2019ve also put on MOSAIC annually since 2016, and for this third year they tapped Hill to give the keynote address with \u201cDisruption\u201d as its theme.\n\nKicking off her address, Hill joked about spending time in Belize and zip-lining for the first time before easing into the White House calling her \u201cDonald Trump is a white supremacist\u201d tweet \u201ca fireable offense\u201d during a press briefing, backed by the man himself on Twitter, of course.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd in case there is anyone who thinks that no one is still riding for Trump, Hill made it clear that they are by sharing details of the snail mail of hate she received along with the social media abuse. \u201cI got called the n-word so much that I thought it was my middle name,\u201d she candidly revealed.\n\n\n\nAll of this happened as Hill was still warming her seat at ESPN\u2019s iconic SportsCenter, dubbed SC6 when she and her longtime co-host, Michael Smith, from the successful His & Hers show, took over in February 2017. ESPN didn\u2019t fire Hill or suspend her for those Trump tweets; rather, the sports network suspended her for another series of tweets in October 2017 that alluded to boycotting Dallas Cowboys advertisers in response to team owner Jerry Jones\u2019 promise to bench players who \u201cdisrespect the flag.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn Atlanta, Hill reiterated that the suspension was justified, noting that \u201cESPN is in the business of sports\u201d and \u201cnot in the business necessarily of being construed as a political organization and I put them firmly in those crosshairs.\u201d She also insisted that it was her decision to leave SC6 and join ESPN microsite The Undefeated to resume her writing career, with hosting TV specials and even creating her own video content as part of the deal.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI never intended to be a disruptor,\u201d she told the crowd. \u201cI never intended to be thrust into a role of activism,\u201d she added, noting that \u201cI didn\u2019t choose the moment; the moment chose me.\u201d\n\nMy worst fears about Hill giving up the fight like so many others whose outspokenness resulted in hard consequences seemed confirmed until she switched it up. As she took on the topics of disruption, diversity and inclusion, she spoke directly to those in hiring positions, who are still overwhelmingly white and male, informing them that people of color and women are experiencing this new old America in ways they can\u2019t even begin to imagine.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn whatever business that you\u2019re in, especially if you\u2019re a woman and you\u2019re a person of color, there\u2019s a level of vulnerability that you feel right now that may be hard for everybody to relate to. You feel a little scared and under attack right now under some of the current policies and tone that our country has taken,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGetting even more real, Hill confessed that, in the current Trump climate and after Charlottesville, Va., especially, there were days she didn\u2019t even want to come to work. \u201cFor the first time in my career,\u201d she admitted, \u201cit kind of put my dual role of person and journalist in conflict with one another.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI never intended to be a disruptor. I never intended to be thrust into a role of activism. I didn\u2019t choose the moment; the moment chose me.\u201d\n\nShe also let those in power know that the solution to diversity and inclusion issues didn\u2019t rest with those of us who didn\u2019t create the problem in the first place, and that hiring some of us was only the first step. \u201cGetting through the door is just one of the problems that needs to be addressed,\u201d she explained. \u201cWe all know there are definitely structures that need to change from a tangible standpoint. We need more women, we need more people of color, you need more LGBTQ people. We know that, but once they make it through the door, then what happens?\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSugarcoating was not on the menu as Hill shared that, in her 20-year career, she knew what it meant to just be a quota. \u201cI\u2019ve had the experience of being wanted for what I represent but not really wanted for what I represent,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what I mean about the difference about once you\u2019re actually through that door.\u201d She added:\n\n\n\nBecause you can talk a lot about wanting us at the table, but will you listen to us once we\u2019re actually in the room?

He\u2019s so good that although Oklahoma\u2019s Trae Young has a bigger name, Sexton will probably be picked ahead of him in the NBA draft. And while Alabama had an up-and-down season this year, that they even made it to the NCAA tournament was largely due to Sexton\u2019s play in the SEC Tournament.\n\n\n\nAnyway, they lost Saturday to Villanova, a team that\u2019s just much better than them. In a weekend full of upsets, Villanova handling Alabama was one of the few outcomes that most people rightly predicted. During the game, while Alabama was down 26 points, Sexton was called for a technical foul for taunting Villanova\u2019s Mikal Bridges. Obviously, this was not a good look, but 19-year-olds do dumb shit sometimes, and this was far from an unforgivable act.\n\nIt was also last weekend that I learned that 1) Joseph Goodman exists, 2) Joseph Goodman writes things that can be read on the internet and 3) Joseph Goodman is a living icon. If Earth is around for another 10,000 years or so, and if people are still writing about sports on the internet then, you still won\u2019t find another take worse than the one Joseph Goodman wrote on Collin Sexton.\n\nLike, remember that scene from The Matrix when Neo gets shot in the hallway and comes back to life and finally realizes he\u2019s the One and sees everything in code and stops the bullets in midair and Agent Smith rushes him and Neo starts doing some no-look, one-handed kung fu shit while making a face like \u201cThese hoes won\u2019t hold me back!\u201d and then dives into Agent Smith\u2019s chest? Well, this piece is Joesph Goodman diving into the internet\u2019s chest.\n\nIt starts with something fact-ish and smarmy, a narrative device to let everyone know that Goodman is coming from a rational and sober place. JOSEPH GOODMAN IS A MOTHERFUCKING ADULT:\n\nCollin Sexton\u2019s final action as a college basketball player was getting hit with a technical foul for taunting a superior opponent while trailing by 26 points.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen he begins his descent into full dog-whistling schoolmarm:\n\nNot exactly the last impression someone wants to make before turning pro, and probably not the type of image the University of Alabama wants to project to the rest of the country after making it back to the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2012.\n\nI\u2019m sure the state of Alabama has some bigger concerns about the image they wish to project to the rest of the country, but maybe that\u2019s just me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, Alabama made it back to the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2012 BECAUSE OF COLLIN SEXTON, THE STAR FRESHMAN POINT GUARD YOU\u2019RE ABOUT TO PLAY MAGA YAHTZEE WITH IN THIS FUCKING \u201cCOLUMN,\u201d YOU DICKWAD! Goodman goes on:\n\nClassless. Clueless. Unacceptable.\n\nHoly shit! Goodman brought out the big guns. Whenever you compose entire paragraphs with just one word, you mean business. Someone call the manager because some serious white business is about to go down. Joseph Goodman is here to write shitty takes and chew bubble gum, and he\u2019s out of bubble gum:\n\nSo, Alabama\u2019s one-and-done point guard took a seat on the bench and watched the final few minutes of his brief college career from the sidelines. Credit to Alabama coach Avery Johnson for at least getting that right on Saturday in Pittsburgh. From the bench, Sexton got a good look at what it must feel like to watch Alabama pummel, say, Coastal Carolina inside Bryant-Denny Stadium on a Saturday in the fall. Only worse. At least Nick Saban is nice enough not to run up the score on the sacrificial lambs of college football. Villanova isn\u2019t wiring $1.5 million into Alabama\u2019s bank account on Monday morning, either.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou probably have to be a seasoned reader of shitty sports takes to see what\u2019s happening here. Although the athletes in power-conference football and basketball are predominately black, basketball is generally regarded as a blacker sport. One of the reasons for this distinction is that basketball generally allows for more individual freedom and improvisation than football does. And by creating this useless juxtaposition of Collin Sexton and the University of Alabama\u2019s football team, Goodman is reminding the readers that football in general and Nick Saban (Alabama\u2019s football coach) specifically wouldn\u2019t allow such indecency.\n\nJoseph Goodman is a pillowcase filled with blueberries.\n\nGoodman follows with some more bullshit and then (finally) gets to the climax. From this point on, we should probably just start calling \u201cexcessive foreplay\u201d \u201cpulling a Joseph Goodman\u201d:\n\nOne, Alabama should be better this time next year. Yes, Sexton will be gone, but that doesn\u2019t seem like such a bad thing after watching him against a truly special team. Alabama wants to win a national championship in basketball. That doesn\u2019t happen with a 6-foot-2 point guard who wants to play isolation basketball when things get tough. Sexton wouldn\u2019t say definitively that he was going pro after Alabama\u2019s loss, but his body language screamed it at the end of regulation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAh yes. We all know that you can\u2019t win national championships with a player talented and driven and confident enough to score 38 points in a game where his team only had three players. Nope. A college basketball team with national-championship aspirations can\u2019t use players like that. Maybe if Collin Sexton wants to help the team, he\u2019d be better served selling hot sausages in the tailgate instead of playing on the court.\n\nThe rest of the piece is dumb and stupid and shitty and full of dog whistles and just reiterates what Goodman said already. The irony here is that as wrong as Goodman is, he might be right about Alabama. Next year, when Collin Sexton is in the NBA, they might be even better. But they\u2019ll be better because the returning players will be better, with another year to grow and gel. Not because their best player is gone.\n\nAnyway, Joseph Goodman is a columnist for Alabama Media Group. He\u2019s on Twitter @JoeGoodmanJr. And I know all of this because it\u2019s attached to the end of the piece, and it\u2019s the only part that makes any sense.

Neither did accomplished authors Sylvia Plath or Charlotte Bront\u00eb, or photographer Diane Arbus. They are among the women highlighted in a new series called \u2018Overlooked\u2019 that will publish obituaries for women who were not singled out for the honor at the time.\n\n\u201cThe first set of obituaries were rolled out March 8 \u2014 International Women\u2019s Day. New York Times national reporter Caitlin Dickerson, who wrote Wells\u2019 obituary, told CBSN\u2019s Elaine Quijano the paper is \u2018acknowledging now that the New York Times was, quite honestly, part of the problem.\u2019\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c \u2018The New York Times is the paper of record \u2014 it always, to a certain extent, reflected the culture of the moment,\u2019 Dickerson said. \u2018When we talk about Ida B. Wells, for example, born in the 1860s, we\u2019re talking about a moment when we, as a general culture, didn\u2019t pay attention to African Americans \u2014 especially African American women.\u2019\n\n\u201cDickerson said \u2018everybody in the building\u2019 was eager to be involved. \u2018I think this is going to be a rolling project,\u2019 Dickerson said.\n\n\u201cThe interest, Dickerson noted, reflects how important the issues of gender and inequality are even in a time of fast-breaking news.

I think we all ought to stop and think this through.\u201d (video)\n\nTime to Recast World of Decision-Making Machines\n\nFirst, the futurist Amy Webb told the audience of journalists, librarians and foundation managers that they could easily be duped by the ever-growing purveyors of artificial intelligence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImages of their faces could be affixed to others\u2019 bodies, their voices to impostors. Media people have acknowledged to pollsters that they are so focused on the present that they don\u2019t pay close attention to what might be in store for them in five, 10 or 20 years.\n\nLater in her talk Wednesday before the Knight Media Forum in Miami, Webb told people of color that they weren\u2019t thought about when the creators of self-driving cars, GPS navigators, robotics and other such technologies were being developed.\n\n\u201cMy question is, what does all this mean for communities of color?\u201d (video) asked Sara Lomax-Reese, president and CEO of black talk-formatted WURD radio in Philadelphia. She was one of about 500 at the sold-out conference sponsored by the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not good,\u201d replied Webb.\n\n\u201cAny person of color who\u2019s ever felt invisible, you\u2019re totally invisible to the networks. Right?\u201d said the author of the 2016 book \u201cThe Signals Are Talking: Why Today\u2019s Fringe Is Tomorrow\u2019s Mainstream: Forecast and Take Action on Tomorrow\u2019s Trends, Today.\u201d\n\n\u201cI could spend an entire day showing you examples of all kinds of places in which machine-learning algorithms don\u2019t recognize darker faces, where if you . . . are a non-Native English speaker, it\u2019s difficult for you to be understood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOne of the primary data sets that was used to train a lot of the voice recognition systems came from Philadelphia from the 1990s; there was a series of I think 700 recoded phone calls. If you think of some of these systems as sort of layered, and each new set of experiments and tools builds on what came before, some of the foundations of some of our modern spoken interfaces come from Philadelphia, but it didn\u2019t come from people \u2014 it came from like, white people in Philly. . . . \u201c\n\nMartin G. Reynolds, co-executive director of the Maynard Institute for Journalism Education, followed up. \u201cAll this work around having a greater pipeline so that there\u2019s more diversity in news organizations so that the work that is done better reflects society. How does this come into play in this new world you\u2019re speaking of?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cSo the answer that I\u2019m going to give to you is the same answer that I\u2019m going to give to you,\u201d Webb said, looking at Lomax-Reese, \u201cabout diversification in technology. We all have to decide that it\u2019s OK for things to be different going forward, and if part of how we got to now is the \u2014 . . .I\u2019m not going to apologize for saying it \u2014 old white boys club . . . we\u2019re talking about machines making decisions for us. I don\u2019t know if I want such a small group of people making decisions for us all. . . . I think we all ought to stop and think this through.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019ve all decided that we\u2019re heading in a direction that we\u2019re uncomfortable with, then there are some easy changes to make. Hire more, create a situation . . . where a person of color can become an executive. Anybody know off the top of their head how many female editors-in-chief of newspapers we currently have? No. Any idea of how many male . . . how many black . . . or Asian or Hispanic editors in chief? . . .\n\n\u201cWe can turn on the diversity tap, we just have to decide that we want to do that, and create the mechanisms for people to actually move up the ladder. But that\u2019s a decision we\u2019ve got to get comfortable with. . . . We\u2019ve got to get more comfortable being around people with different ideas. If we don\u2019t get comfortable with that, we end up in these catastrophic places, and I don\u2019t want to live in that world.\u201d\n\nOutside of the news business, some have recognized the danger that lack of diversity can cause in our brave new world of artificial intelligence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cData for Black Lives is a group of activists, organizers, and mathematicians committed to the mission of using data science to create concrete and measurable change in the lives of Black people,\u201d begins one group\u2019s statement of principles.\n\n\u201cSince the advent of computing, big data and algorithms have penetrated virtually every aspect of our social and economic lives. These new data systems have tremendous potential to empower communities of color. Tools like statistical modeling, data visualization, and crowd-sourcing, in the right hands, are powerful instruments for fighting bias, building progressive movements, and promoting civic engagement.\n\n\u201cBut history tells a different story, one in which data is too often wielded as an instrument of oppression, reinforcing inequality and perpetuating injustice. Redlining was a data-driven enterprise that resulted in the systematic exclusion of Black communities from key financial services. More recent trends like predictive policing, risk-based sentencing, and predatory lending are troubling variations on the same theme. Today, discrimination is a high-tech enterprise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cData for Black Lives seeks to mobilize scientists around racial justice issues. . . .\u201d\n\nPhoto: Angel Valentin/Knight Foundation\n\nAttention to Diversity: One Remedy for Lack of Trust\n\nIn the United States alone, foundations spent $140 million to support journalism in 2015, according to Media Impact Funders, a Philadelphia-based organization that tracks such things.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGlobally, the figure was $153.5 million. The providers of those funds are increasingly worried that the institutions they are supporting aren\u2019t trusted.\n\nCould more attention to diversity help close that gap? Some at this week\u2019s Knight Media Forum were saying yes.\n\nAlberto Ibarguen, president of the Knight Foundation, said Tuesday in his opening remarks, \u201cAs local and regional news has weakened, trust has declined. Based on a Knight Foundation survey of 20,000 respondents:\n\n\u201c45% see a great deal of bias in media coverage today, compared to 25% in 1989\n\n\u201c66% say media doesn\u2019t do a good job separating fact from opinion, compared to 58% who thought the media DID do a good job of that in 1984\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cLess than half of Americans can name an objective news source\n\n\u201cAnd yet 84% see the media as key to our democracy\n\nPhoto: George Dalton Tolbert IV\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI believe people are saying, \u2018News and information are important, but we don\u2019t think you are doing it well.\u2019 This is a place where I believe foundations of all sizes can make a difference. . . .\u201d\n\n\n\nAt one of the breakout sessions, \u201cCommunity-Focused Journalism: Inspiration and How-to for Funders,\u201d Paul Waters of the Democracy Fund and Molly de Agular of the News Integrity Initiative outlined the role foundations can play in shaping community conversations and how funders can influence news operations. No. 4 on Waters\u2019 list was \u201cDemand More Diversity.\u201d\n\nMartina Guzman, a Detroit-based freelancer, urged more support for freelancers who want to cover their communities in ways that newsroom staffers are not permitted. The $200 that a public radio network might pay for a long-form piece isn\u2019t sufficient. \u201cJournalists of color feel so isolated,\u201d she said at another point.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCollaborations of all kinds \u2014 with other news organizations and with community groups \u2014 were encouraged. One of the most prominent was launched in the San Francisco Bay Area last summer. News organizations collectively tackled the housing crisis.\n\n\u201cThe Bay Area Media Collaborative will strive to stimulate more intensive and ongoing collaboration among news organizations, most of which are hamstrung by small news staffs and reporting budgets,\u201d Jon Funabiki, executive director of Renaissance Journalism, wrote in August. \u201cIn that sense, BAMC will more closely resemble an earlier Renaissance Journalism initiative called the Detroit Journalism Cooperative (DJC), which brought together nine news outlets. As in our other initiatives, the DJC news partners produced award-winning stories about Detroit\u2019s financial crisis, segregation, policing, the schools and other important issues. Through collaboration, the journalists had more impact because they discovered new stories and reached new audiences. . . .\u201d\n\nJason Alcorn, MediaShift: Knight Media Forum Focuses on Non-Profit News, Impact and Danger of Algorithms\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMiranda Bogen, medium.com: Artificial intelligence will force us to confront our values (Sept. 22, 2016)\n\nEditorial, Hartford Courant: The State Of Journalism Today\n\nFuture Today Institute: 2018 Tech Trends For Journalism and Media\n\nLogan Koepke, medium.com: Pre-trial algorithms deserve a fresh look, study suggests (March 30, 2017)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJeff Larson, Julia Angwin and Terry Parris Jr., ProPublica: How Machines Learn to Be Racist (Oct. 19, 2016)\n\nSandi Miller, MIT News: Calculating the cost of tech-fueled discrimination (Dec. 13, 2017)\n\nAnna Orso, billypenn.com: Can Philly\u2019s new technology predict recidivism without being racist?

Journal apologized Thursday after being widely criticized for running a cartoon equating the young, undocumented immigrants known as \u201cDreamers\u201d with members of the criminal Latino gang MS-13.\n\n\u201cIt was a mistake,\u201d Karen Moses told Journal-isms by telephone on Friday. \u201cGoing forward, there definitely will be\u201d closer scrutiny of the cartoons selected for the newspaper.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t talk about how we make our decisions,\u201d Moses said, declining to disclose who made the decision to green-light the offending cartoon. However, Moses added that as the editor of the newspaper, with jurisdiction over its editorial pages, she takes responsibility.\n\nSimon Romero reported for the New York Times that the cartoon was \u201cprompting outrage from prominent Democrats and Republicans in the state.\u201d The illustration, by Sean Delonas, \u201cdepicts a white couple being accosted in a back alley by three men. One is holding the couple at gunpoint and taking the woman\u2019s purse. Another is wearing a jacket emblazoned with \u2018MS-13,\u2019 the name of a gang that President Trump and others have repeatedly invoked to denounce illegal immigration. The third has on a ski mask and a suicide vest of smoking explosives.\n\n\u201cThe male victim tells the woman, \u2018Now, honey ... I believe they prefer to be called \u201cDreamers,\u201d \u2018 a reference to young undocumented immigrants predominantly from Latin America, and adds, \u2018Or future Democrats.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe cartoon, which was published on Wednesday, quickly elicited criticism around New Mexico, where about 48.5 percent of the population is Hispanic, the highest percentage of any state in the country. Tensions have simmered in the state, which Mr. Trump lost in the 2016 election, over the federal government\u2019s immigration policies. . . . \u201c\n\nRomero also noted Moses\u2019 written apology, in which she said \u201cthat the cartoon \u2018appeared to us to be poking at President Trump\u2019s rhetoric by portraying a quaking Republican couple who were painting Dreamers with a broad, totally false, brush.\u2019\n\n\u201cBut Mr. Delonas, the cartoonist, said that while he sympathized with Ms. Moses, he disagreed with her assessment of the illustration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c \u2018That\u2019s not the way I read it,\u2019 said Mr. Delonas, 56, a former cartoonist at The New York Post. \u2018I\u2019ve learned that MS-13 is purposely sending minors over here to commit crimes. I\u2019m pretty sure that the cartels are using minors for a lot of their drug dealing.\u2019 . . .\u201d\n\nMoses told Journal-isms that she was not aware of previous controversies involving Delonas\u2019 cartoons, but \u201cI am now.\u201d\n\nAfter 23 years at the paper, Delonas took a buyout from the New York Post in 2013, during the Barack Obama administration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDuring a long career at the Post, Mr. Delonas was definitely un-PC,\u201d Kara Bloomgarden-Smoke wrote then for the New York Observer. \u201cHis cartoons for the tabloid at times attracted controversy \u2014 like his 2009 cartoon of a [cop] shooting a monkey, while [another cop quips] that they will need to find someone else to write the stimulus bill (prompting cries of racism since Mr. Delonas seemed to be equating a chimp with the president). . . .\u201d\n\nIn a rare move, the Post responded to the outcry by apologizing \u201cto those who were offended by the image.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, after the Associated Press reported on the New York Police Department\u2019s clandestine spying on Muslim communities, for which the AP won a Pulitzer Prize, Delonas depicted three Muslims making bombs in an apartment. Looking out the window at the police, one says, \u201cHello, AP Press? I\u2019d like to register a complaint against the N.Y.P.D. for spying on us.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Thursday, May Ortega, president of the New Mexico chapter of the National Association of Hispanic Journalists, wrote that she was dissatisfied with Moses\u2019 printed apology. \u201cThrough publishing this image, you have failed your community and your staff \u2014 some of whom we represent. We demand a proper apology for publishing this racist image and a retraction of it. And we ask that you implement a better internal system to avoid these kinds of regrettable actions.\u201d\n\nNationally, NAHJ issued a statement Friday saying, \u201cThis morning, NAHJ is able to report a meeting that occurred over the phone with Karen Moses, Editor-in-Chief of the Albuquerque Journal. This critical and sincere conversation included the EIC taking responsibility for the grave error, identified the issue allowing this to happen and laying out the preventative measures the Journal will be putting in place moving forward. . . .\u201d\n\nHowever, Moses told Journal-isms that the telephone call lasted 30 seconds \u2014 \u201cmaybe two minutes\u201d \u2014 and that she did not specify what preventative measures would be taken.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Journal did not participate in the 2017 newsroom diversity survey of the American Society of News Editors.

Their story was produced in collaboration with Univision Chicago, and made available in English and Spanish.\n\n\u201cIn 2017, the police department hired whites and Latinos at rates more than double that of African-Americans, who made up just 17 percent of the total 1,126 new hires,\u201d Stark and Litttle continued. For Univision, the angle for the story, written by Adriana Cardona Maguigad, was, \u201cMore Hispanics make it through the CPD hiring process but African Americans are falling behind.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStark and Little wrote, \u201cIt\u2019s not that blacks shy away from seeking police jobs. A Chicago Reporter examination of police hiring data going back to 2013 \u2014 the most complete recruitment records available \u2014 shows that many African-Americans have applied to the force in recent years. They just haven\u2019t been hired, hurting efforts to further diversify the department as it struggles to improve its relationship with black communities.\n\n\u201cOf more than 8,000 black applicants, nearly 30 percent didn\u2019t show up for the written entrance exam, the first step in the recruitment process, while 17 percent failed the test, according to data analyzed by the Reporter. Many applicants who passed the test later dropped out of the process, which includes an extensive background check and physical, psychological and drug tests.\n\n\u201cIn some policing circles, the prevailing sentiment has been that few African-Americans were interested in joining the force. But the five-year data indicate a different story: When it comes to cultivating black candidates, the issue may be retention, not recruitment, in a multistep process that can take years. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow a Police Department Institutionalizes Racism\n\nFrom 2013 to 2017, members of the Columbus, Ohio, Division of Police \u201cfatally shot 28 people, according to Mapping Police Violence. Twenty-one of them were black . . ., \u201c Alli Maloney reported Wednesday for Pacific Standard.\n\n\u201cEvery time a Columbus police officer kills a citizen, two sides to the story exist. But aggressive behavior by officers often goes unchecked by the department \u2014 which is backed by a powerful police union \u2014 and decades of non-indictments from the prosecutor\u2019s office for those who kill shows how, in Ohio\u2019s [capital], the victim\u2019s families are often silenced and officers\u2019 perspective becomes the main narrative.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe CPD has operated this way for decades \u2014 a narrative not dissimilar to other police departments across the country. But how does that sort of aggression, that deep-seated racism, become institutionalized into an organization?

Donald Trump\u2019s Tumultuous First Year in Office\n\nDonald Trump made it his business to dominate the news cycle as much as possible in 2017, and there is no sign of a change in strategy for 2018.\n\nHis comments on race and religion led journalists of color to confront his press representatives at briefings and to question whether to flat-out call the president a white supremacist. In one of many outrageous examples, from May, then-Press Secretary Sean Spicer demonized Hispanic immigrant teens accused of rape, using the accusation as justification for the president\u2019s campaign against immigrants who are in the country illegally.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt turned out that the charges against the teens were dropped. The defense maintained all along that the sex was consensual. The White House was questioned sharply and justifiably about its rush to judgment. CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta was often front and center.\n\nThere was the feud between April Ryan, Washington correspondent for American Urban Radio Networks, and Omarosa Manigault Newman, who, after rumors that her time was limited, was ousted in December as a White House adviser, effective in 2018. Omarosa\u2019s appearance at the National Association of Black Journalists convention in August proved to be a \u201chot mess\u201d as she clashed with panel moderator Ed Gordon.\n\nRyan was not invited to the White House Christmas Party for the first time in 20 years. \u201cI don\u2019t think I was overlooked,\u201d Ryan told the Washington Post. \u201cI think they don\u2019t like me. For whatever reason, they have disdain for me.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome news organizations, among them the Post and the New York Times, produced a dizzying series of scoops in May about Trump and his associates\u2019 ties to Russia. But black and brown reporters were not on the teams unearthing them.\n\nDean Baquet, executive editor of the Times, attributed the low representation to an industry-wide problem.\n\n\u201cThere are not enough investigative reporters who happen to be African American or Latino,\u201d Baquet said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump\u2019s demonization of the news media \u2014 calling members \u201cenemies of the people\u201d \u2014 had worldwide consequences. His insistence on dominating news cycles was not only crowding out other news, but emboldening autocrats elsewhere. The Trump administration was delivering a message, said Joel Simon of the Committee to Protect Journalists, that \u201cJournalists are contemptible, and governments that crack down on the media face no consequences in terms of their relationship with the US. . . .\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s appeals to white nationalists gave a boost to best-selling author Ta-Nehisi Coates of the Atlantic, whose public profile rose higher with publication of \u201cThe First White President,\u201d an article excerpted from his book about the Obama era, \u201cWe Were Eight Years in Power.\u201d\n\nNews media efforts to report more on Trump supporters met with pushback from some journalists of color, who argued that news involving voters of color was being sacrificed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe spend an inordinate amount of time looking at angry white voters,\u201d Nikole Hannah-Jones, a writer for the New York Times Magazine who specializes in racial issues, said at the Online News Association convention in October. \u201cThis is the first election after the [weakening of the] Voting Rights Act and voter suppression. Lots of votes were probably suppressed.\u201d\n\nA study from the battleground state of Wisconsin \u201cestimates 16,800 or more people in Dane and Milwaukee counties were deterred from casting ballots in November because of Wisconsin\u2019s voter ID law,\u201d Patrick Marley and Jason Stein reported Sept. 26 for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. The study found the ID law disproportionately affected African Americans and low-income people.\n\nIn the aftermath of Democrat Doug Jones\u2019 upset victory over Republican Roy Moore in Alabama\u2019s special December election for the U.S. Senate seat vacated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, African American voters \u2014 especially African American women \u2014 were credited with saving the day for Jones. Many were surprised.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSheila Tyson, a member of the Birmingham City Council who is Alabama convener of the nonpartisan National Coalition on Black Civic Participation, told Journal-isms, \u201cno one covered us and what we were doing.\u201d\n\n2. Sexual Harassment Charges Bring Down Powerful\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe \u201csilence breakers\u201d \u2014 women and men who came forward with accusations of sexual harassment \u2014 were Time magazine\u2019s \u201cPerson of the Year,\u201d and it was appropriate that Tarana Burke, a black woman, was among them. A social activist, Burke first used the hashtag #MeToo more than a decade ago as part of her work building solidarity among young survivors of harassment and assault.\n\n\n\nAs with the Trump investigations, black and brown journalists were not prominent among the reporters uncovering misdeeds, but were among the accusers and the accused.\n\nThe accused included talk-show host Tavis Smiley; Stephen Henderson, editorial page editor of the Detroit Free Press; BuzzFeed White House correspondent Adrian Carrasquillo; longtime Fox Business anchor Charles Payne; and Francisco Cort\u00e9s, vice president of Fox News for the English-language Fox News Latino website, now stripped of original content. In the Cort\u00e9s case, 21st Century Fox reached an agreement with Fox worth more than $2.5 million in late February, Emily Steel reported for the New York Times in March.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost of these men denied the charges or said they were overblown. A rape charge against Payne is in court. Writing in New York magazine on Dec. 1, Suki Kim disclosed problems that John Hockenberry, host of New York Public Radio\u2019s \u201cThe Takeaway,\u201d who is white, had with black female co-hosts on a show designed to spotlight diversity.\n\nSeparately, veteran Chicago rock critic Jim DeRogatis reported for months on a stunning story about R&B singer R. Kelly and young women said to be under his psychological and sexual control, held as if in a cult. \u201cThree separate media organizations were interested but got cold feet at the last minute, DeRogatis said,\u201d according to Margaret Sullivan of the Washington Post.\n\nFinally, Gawker published it. Kelly has insisted that there\u2019s no truth that he runs a cult or anything like it, Sullivan said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWriting in October for splinternews.com, Michael Arceneaux asked, \u201cWhat will it take to get more of us to give a damn about R. Kelly\u2019s alleged crimes?\n\nThe answer may lie in who his victims are. \u201cThe difference between Kelly and other powerful men like [Hollywood mogul Harvey] Weinstein and [the late Fox News founder Roger] Ailes is that Kelly\u2019s accusers are primarily black girls and women. Black girls and women who are young or underage. Black girls and women who are poor or working class. . . .\u201d\n\nIn October, four female journalists, including former Detroit Free Press photographer Regina Boone, filed a federal lawsuit against the Free Press and its parent company, Gannett, alleging pay discrimination.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n3. \u2018Suspension\u2019 of Roland Martin\u2019s \u2018NewsOne Now\u2019\n\nAfter four years, the black-owned TV One cable network pulled \u201cNewsOne Now With Roland Martin,\u201d the only black-oriented daily television news program, saying in a December announcement that it is \u201cworking to restructure NewsOne Now in 2018 under a new format that will better serve its audience and advertisers.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe decision baffled many, especially since the program was expanded from one hour to two in the year\u2019s third quarter. TV One had proclaimed that the show had experienced \u201csix consecutive quarters of growth.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe staff wrap party for the last episode of NewsOne Now with Roland Martin was not supposed to feel like it did,\u201d Jason Johnson wrote for The Root.\n\n\u201cI walked into the staff kitchen and saw Martin in all of his fuchsia glory, smiling, ascot crisp, happily chopping it up. \u2018What\u2019s up, baby?\u2019 he said, then hit me with a hug like we were at Essence Fest or the Republican convention, not the last day of an award-winning TV show. . . . The more people I talked to, the more obvious it\u2019s became that nobody knew for sure why NewsOne Now was going off the air, but the one thing on which they did agree was that black folks were going to be the worse for it. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. FCC Aligns Itself With Big Media\n\nIn \u201can awful new low\u201d that elicited warnings about \u201ca new wave of media consolidation,\u201d the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rolled back media ownership regulations under the guise of trying \u201cto modernize its broadcast ownership rules & to help promote ownership diversity,\u201d Jessica Corbett wrote Nov. 16 for Common Dreams.\n\n\u201c \u2018Any pretense that this vote will help journalism or increase ownership diversity is cynical and offensive,\u2019 said Free Press president and CEO Craig Aaron, warning that the move will \u2018lead to more mergers, more layoffs, and more communities that have no news outlets in place to cover important stories and hold officials accountable.\u2019 . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe approved order:\n\n\u201cEliminates newspaper/broadcast and radio/television cross-ownership rules, which imposed restrictions on owning multiple media outlets in the same market;\n\n\u201cRelaxes rules about local television ownership \u2014 including joint sales agreements, which allow a company to control news operations at several stations in one market, where stations would typically compete against each other; and [formally] requests \u2018comment on how to design and implement\u2019 an FCC diversity incubator program. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe order comes as local news becomes more precious. \u201cAs local newspapers have closed across the country, more and more communities are left with no daily local news outlet at all,\u201d Yemile Bucay, Vittoria Elliott, Jennie Kamin and Andrea Park wrote for the spring 2017 issue of Columbia Journalism Review.\n\nIn December, the FCC scrapped so-called \u201cnet neutrality\u201d regulations that prohibited broadband providers from blocking websites or charging for higher-quality service or certain content.\n\nStanding with other progressive organizations, the NAACP said it \u201cis staunchly opposed to any attempt to censor or manipulate information on the internet, especially if it creates a barrier to entry for people of color.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJournalists of color associations have long opposed media consolidation. In 2014, the National Association of Black Journalists and the National Association of Hispanic Journalists joined others in a letter opposing joint sales agreements, saying, \u201cThese arrangements have harmed communities of color by leading to the elimination of local newscasts and employment opportunities for journalists of color. Furthermore, they have reduced the opportunities for people of color to own broadcast stations. . . . \u201c\n\nProponents say the arrangements actually save jobs by allowing for financially healthier broadcast companies. Armstrong Williams, the conservative commentator who has benefited from such agreements as owner of Howard Stirk Holdings, wrote in Broadcasting & Cable in December, \u201cbroadcast ownership has permitted Howard Stirk Holdings to create an incubator for African American journalism students by providing tuition scholarships, while providing field experience outside of the classroom.

The Numbers\n\nThe news industry enters 2018 approaching the 50th anniversary March 1 of the Kerner Commission report, officially the report of the presidentially appointed National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders.\n\nThe examination of the causes of the 1967 urban uprisings said that \u201cfewer than 5 percent of the people employed by the news business in the United States today are Negroes\u201d and that \u201cthe journalistic profession has been shockingly backward in seeking out, hiring, training and promoting Negroes.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2017, the American Society of News Editors\u2019 annual diversity survey of newspapers and online outlets (but not broadcasters) found that journalists of color comprised 16.6 percent of the workforce in responding U.S. newsrooms.\n\nIn local television news, the workforce rose to 24.4 percent people of color, Bob Papper reported in his annual survey for the Radio Television Digital News Association and Hofstra University.\n\n\u201cStill, as far as minorities are concerned, the bigger picture remains unchanged,\u201d Papper wrote. \u201cIn the last 27 years, the minority population in the U.S. has risen 12.1 points; but the minority workforce in TV news is up just over half that at 6.6. And the minority workforce in radio is less than 1 point higher. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMizell Stewart III, then president of the American Society of News Editors, wrote members in May, \u201cThe lack of progress is palpable because the continuing transformation of media business models has led to dramatic reductions in newsroom employment, particularly at local newspapers.\n\n\u201cIn many legacy news organizations, moving the needle on staff diversity took a back seat to the survival of the enterprise. . . .\u201d ASNE is emphasizing diversity at the leadership level with its \u201cEmerging Leaders Institutes.\u201d\n\nStill, there were initiatives as well as setbacks.\n\nNew America Media, which described itself as \u201cthe nation\u2019s first and largest collaboration of and advocate for ethnic, community, minority, and bilingual media sources,\u201d closed Nov. 30 after 45 years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, the City University of New York Graduate School of Journalism said it hopes to fill the gap.\n\nThe Gizmodo Media Group announced that 50 percent of its workforce is of color, and the Association of Alternative Newsmedia, representing the overwhelmingly white alternative press, said it would conduct a demographic survey of newspaper staff. However, African American columnists Barry Saunders of the News & Observer in Raleigh, N.C., and Shaun King of the Daily News in New York, parted company with their employers. (King is now with the Intercept.)\n\nA study from the National Association of Hispanic Journalists excoriated coverage of Latinos on the evening news shows, but the hurricane disaster in Puerto Rico put Latino journalists front and center.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication added a new professional program called Cronkite Noticias, a newscast featuring six bilingual journalists who write and broadcast for the Spanish-speaking community in Arizona,\u201d as Alexa Buechler wrote in February for the State Press, the student newspaper at Arizona State University..\n\nWilliam C. Rhoden, former New York Times sports columnist, joined The Undefeated, which began the \u201cRhoden Fellows,\u201d a sports journalism internship program focused on identifying and training aspiring African American journalists from historically black colleges and universities.\n\nIn Silicon Valley, Google partnered with Howard University to launch a school branch on the company\u2019s campus, where undergraduate students will learn from Google engineers in addition to the university\u2019s own faculty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe New York-based Theatre Communications Group began a theater criticism and journalism track in Rising Leaders of Color, \u201cdesigned to deepen the pool of voices documenting, reflecting, and challenging the field.\u201d\n\nA post-mortem from the Michigan Civil Rights Commission on the Flint water crisis harkened back to the language of Kerner, saying that historic and systemic racism played a role in the public health catastrophe.\n\n\u201cThe limited coverage begs the same question of the media that we ask of decision makers: Would things have been covered differently if it wasn\u2019t Flint? Might the story have led the news, would stories have been more extensive? Most critical, would reporters have pushed government officials to provide acceptable answers? Those who made decisions on what stories to cover and how to do so will doubtlessly insist that race played no part in their decision making, that such factors were not considered at all.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. Jemele Hill Saga Prompts Warnings About Twitter\n\n\u201cOn Monday, Jemele Hill returns to The Six after a two-week suspension for violating ESPN\u2019s social media policy,\u201d Bryan Curtis wrote on Oct. 22 for theringer.com.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut a key meeting happened Sunday, when Hill sat down with ESPN president John Skipper. According to two sources, the meeting occurred away from the Bristol campus; Hill and Skipper were alone. . . . It was the first time the two met since September 13, two days after Hill called President Donald Trump a white supremacist on Twitter and the day that the Trump White House called for her to be fired. As Hill wrote in The Undefeated, she cried during that meeting.\n\n\u201cHill\u2019s suspension is both ESPN bureaucratic intrigue and a national political cause that has been joined by everyone from J.R. Smith to the ACLU. . . .\u201d\n\nOn Nov. 2, Jeremy Barr wrote for the Hollywood Reporter that, \u201cthe network publicly released a new set of social media guidelines that deal with social and political issues. The effort was led by Kevin Merida, the former Washington Post managing editor who runs the ESPN property The Undefeated. . . .\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cA section of the guidelines deal specifically with commentaries. ESPN employees are told: \u2018Commentaries on relevant sports-related issues are appropriate, but we should refrain from overt partisanship or endorsement of particular candidates, politicians or political parties. ... We should offer balance or recognize opposing views, as warranted. We should avoid personal attacks and inflammatory rhetoric.\u2019\n\n\u201cWhile Skipper told Sports Business Daily that the guidelines were not released in response to Hill\u2019s case, Hill initially got in trouble for writing on Twitter that Donald Trump is a \u2018white supremacist,\u2019 which would likely be considered \u2018inflammatory rhetoric\u2019 under the new guidelines. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. Ebony\u2019s New Ownership Disappoints\n\nPerhaps no development created more disappointment among black journalists than the unrealized promise of Ebony magazine under its new owner, Clear View Group, a black-owned Texas company.\n\nAlong with Fox News, Ebony was awarded this year\u2019s Thumbs Down Award from the National Association of Black Journalists. NABJ said the magazine \u201chas made headlines this year because of staff cuts; the relocation of its headquarters from its founding base in Chicago to Los Angeles [actually, only editorial offices were relocated there]; and, its very public and sometimes offensive responses to reports of late or non-payment for work already performed by staff or freelance journalists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c \u2018Many of the decisions being made by Ebony\u2019s new owners seem counter to the vision of founder John H. Johnson,\u2019 said NABJ Vice President of Print Marlon A. Walker. \u2018Ebony and its sister publication Jet are near and dear to us. To hear writers whose words bring us much joy aren\u2019t being paid for those words is sad, unconscionable, unacceptable.\u2019 . . .\u201d\n\nEbony received a constant stream of negative publicity almost since Clear View purchased the magazine in 2016 from the Johnson Publishing Co., headed by Linda Johnson Rice, daughter of the founders. Writers filed suit over nonpayment and personnel have frequently changed.\n\nTracey M. Ferguson, who in February was named editor-in-chief of a revived Jet magazine, then in May was also given the editorship of Ebony, left the company, Ferguson confirmed in October.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe National Writers Union said in December it is in court representing 48 freelancers who are owed more than $80,000 by Ebony, and says its next court date is Friday.\n\n8. Investigative Reporting Gets a Boost\n\nIn June, the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation awarded $150,000 to the new Ida B. Wells Society for Investigative Reporting to expand its training programs aimed at supporting journalists of color interested in that crucial specialty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c \u2018There are a lot of journalists of color who want to be doing [investigative] reporting, but don\u2019t see a path for themselves and have never seen other journalists of color doing this job,\u2019 New York Times Magazine reporter Nikole Hannah-Jones, one of the Ida B. Wells Society\u2019s co-founders, told my colleague Ricardo Bilton earlier this year,\u201d Joseph Lichterman wrote then for Nieman Report.\n\n\n\n\u201c \u2018When you learn about journalism heroes in college, they are white \u2014 usually white men. It\u2019s important that journalists of color see themselves in these positions and get to be trained by people whose experiences are similar to theirs.\u2019 \u201d\n\nUncovering wrongdoing is one of the basic missions of journalistic organizations, one that can best be fulfilled by media with the resources, commitment and experience to give consumers more than opinion pieces and rewriting of others\u2019 work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen the Kerner Commission took the news media to task 50 years ago, insisting that \u201cthey must make a reality of integration \u2014 in both their product and personnel,\u201d it also said, \u201cthey must report the travail of our cities with compassion and in depth\u201d [PDF \u2014 Go to Chapter 15].\n\nIn too many cases, the investigative reporting listed below \u2014 just a few examples \u2014 did not involve journalists of color. But in most cases, it did make life better for people of color, or strive to.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, the Boston Globe and the Atlanta Journal-Constitution all undertook series examining race relations in their cities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn March, the Marshall Project and the Washington Post \u201crevealed that 19 state juvenile-justice agencies regularly or sometimes require parents to pay for the cost of their children\u2019s incarcerations. Counties in another 28 states also routinely engage in the practice,\u201d Bill Keller, editor-in-chief of the Marshall Project, wrote to email subscribers. \u201cThe City of Philadelphia, where the story was focused, announced a few hours after our story was published that it would end the practice of charging parents who have kids in detention. . . .\u201d\n\nIn October, the Miami Herald reported on \u201cFight Club,\u201d a multimedia investigative series that focused on Florida\u2019s Department of Juvenile Justice. \u201cThe Herald investigation revealed a system rife with problems: Staffers organized and bet on fights between kids; workers were hired despite their criminal backgrounds; 12 juvenile detainees died in state care since 2000,\u201d Deirdra Funcheon noted in Columbia Journalism Review.\n\nThe Charlotte Observer wrote about prison corruption in North Carolina, prompting a state review.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn March, Jodi S. Cohen and Jennifer Smith Richards reported for the Chicago Tribune that \u201cChicago officers found at fault for misconduct have escaped punishment for years because authorities lost track of their cases, a Tribune investigation has found.\u201d\n\nThe Commercial Appeal in Memphis looked at Memphis\u2019 broadening epidemic of gun assaults, in which 7,000 people had been murdered on Memphis streets since 1960.\n\nThe investigations extended overseas. In November, Nima Elbagir, Raja Razek, Alex Platt and Bryony Jones verified for CNN the existence of slave auctions in Libya.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn April, following a Washington Post investigation, \u201cApple said it has temporarily stopped buying cobalt mined by hand in Congo while it continues to deal with problems with child labor and harsh work conditions,\u201d the Post\u2019s Todd C. Frankel reported.\n\n9. A Transition in Indian Country\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndian Country Today Media Network, the most comprehensive source of original reporting about Native Americans, \u201cis taking a hiatus to consider alternative business models,\u201d Publisher Ray Halbritter of the Oneida Indian Nation announced on Sept. 4.\n\n\n\nThe National Congress of American Indians announced the next month that is assuming control of the assets of Indian Country Today Media Network, the result of a donation to the organization by the Oneida nation.\n\nNo one can debate the need for strong reporting from Indian Country. \u201cThere is no doubt that Standing Rock changed the way national media outlets think about Indian Country,\u201d Graham Lee Brewer wrote in November for High Country News.\u201dMore than a year after thousands of people gathered to stop the construction of an oil pipeline over Sioux protests, the desire to tell the stories of Indigenous communities is stronger than ever. Unfortunately there aren\u2019t enough publications that know how to tell those stories accurately. Yes, many of these accounts are technically factual, but media have a hard time, even today, properly representing Native communities across the country. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Atlantic magazine\u2019s acclaimed January/February cover story \u201cMy President Was Black\u201d by Ta-Nehisi Coates mistakenly reported that \u201cAfrican Americans rank at the bottom of nearly every major socioeconomic measure in the country.\u201d According to the U.S. Census Bureau, that dubious distinction belongs to Native Americans. Their omission is \u201cfairly common,\u201d Bryan Pollard, Cherokee, president of the Native American Journalists Association, told Journal-isms.\n\nIn good news for Native people, \u201cThe Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde joined an increasing number of other Native American Tribes nationwide in adopting an Independent Press Ordinance that will codify that the Tribal news publication has the independence to report Grand Ronde news objectively and free from undue political influence by Tribal elected officials,\u201d the Native American Journalists Association announced last January from Grand Ronde, Ore.\n\nThe news is significant because \u201ca free press is the exception and not the rule\u201d in Indian Country, Pollard said then.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10.

Aside from being one of the longest-running fashion magazines around (79 years and counting, to be exact), it\u2019s also one of the more inclusive, featuring women of various colors, sizes and ages long before its competitors caught on.\n\n\n\nMatter of fact, we were pleased to see that its judging committee featured several of our faves on the beauty and style scene, including Felicia Walker Benson, Lacy Redway, Patrice Grell Yursik and Sai de Silva. We were equally thrilled to see a few of our favorite products validated by Glamour\u2019s list, which covered both designer and drugstore finds in skin care, hair care, and makeup\u2014even organic offerings.\n\nAnd because we love a bargain, let\u2019s start where we get the most bang for our buck: at the drugstore. While we love a good designer splurge, there are some low-cost products folks are simply sleeping on, and these are the ones both Glamour and The Glow Up agreed on:\n\nSimple Water Boost Micellar Water, $9: You want to get super clean in a few swipes? This is the product. Micellar water made big waves in 2017, but Simple\u2019s ... simple formula is among our favorites for all types of skin, containing no fragrances, color or harsh chemicals.\n\n\n\nOlay Eyes Deep Hydrating Eye Gel, $30: This pick may seem equally old-school and expensive for the drugstore, but for tired eyes (am I the only one who has those? should it be called \u201ceditor\u2019s eyes\u201d?), this is an instant fix, and just a dab will do ya. Trust, it\u2019s worth it.\n\nDove Invisible Dry Spray Antiperspirant, $5: Yeah, yeah, we know ... Dove messed up big time in 2017. But we\u2019re not ones to throw out the baby with the bath wash, so to speak, and the good this brand has done and continues to do\u2014including inclusive advertising, hiring and ongoing self-esteem workshops for underprivileged black and brown girls\u2014should not be overshadowed by an admittedly really stupid mistake.\n\nThat said, their Invisible Dry Spray is one of the best antiperspirants around, and literally keeps us looking (and smelling) clean in our white tees ... and black tees ... and red tees ...\n\nThat said, their Invisible Dry Spray is one of the best antiperspirants around, and literally keeps us looking (and smelling) clean in our white tees ... and black tees ... and red tees ... L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris Brow Stylist Definer, $9: So yeah, this is my daily go-to for my brows, which never quite grew in any glamorous fashion even before I plucked them into En Vogue-level submission in my high school and college years. Aside from the brush at one end, the dense angled retractable product at the other is never too red, too gray, too waxy, or too creamy. It goes on realistically, and stays all day. Enough said.\n\nCoverGirl LashBlast Volume, $9: LashBlast has eclipsed GreatLash as our go-to drugstore brand, and for good reason: Every variation in this line gives us the big, lush lashes we\u2019ve been looking for (or at least, me, who has absolutely anemic lashes). Two non-clumpy coats, and we\u2019re good to go!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnto the organics. As much as we hate the price point, one product line Glamour really got right was Tata Harper, who started her skin care in her own garden. This is a bite-the-bullet purchase, but I\u2019ve personally been known to hoard samples to give myself mini facials on the road.\n\nTata Harper Clarifying Moisturizer, $105: Damn it, I wish this stuff wasn\u2019t so good, but for my now confused, middle-aged, \u201cI want to dry up and break out\u201d skin, this stuff has worked wonders. Sorry, not sorry.\n\nTata Harper Clarifying Mask, $68: Also, and as well.\n\nFor curly and textured hair (first of all, can we give Glamour big ups for realizing this deserved its own category?) there were a couple of picks that hit the high and low of our budgets, but did equally amazing things for our curls:\n\nAlterna Caviar Infinite Color Hold Shampoo & Conditioner, $34 each: Yep, not cheap, but great\u2014especially for aging or overworked hair. Somehow, this miracle potion tricks my follicles into believing they\u2019re at least a decade younger. And who doesn\u2019t want that?\n\nDark and Lovely Au Naturale Anti-Shrinkage Clumping Curl Clay Cleanser, $10: Look, shrinkage is a real issue, people (take that however you want to take it), and we\u2019re grateful that someone on Dark and Lovely\u2019s chemistry team saw this problem and sought to solve it. This product truly puts the coils in curls, and gives definition where frizz wants to flourish. We\u2019re here for it.\n\nDove Refresh+Care Unscented Dry Shampoo, $4: Yep, Dove came so nice, they made it twice, and we promise you, if you\u2019re don\u2019t already, dry shampoo is the one product you should include in your arsenal. Workout hair? Dry shampoo. Need volume at the roots? Dry shampoo. Too much product weighing you down? Dry shampoo. And for $4, can you really afford not to experiment a bit?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor makeup, we only found two that found us completely in agreement with Glamour, at both ends of our price range:\n\nGiorgio Armani Power Fabric Foundation, $64: Nope, there are aren\u2019t 40 shades, there are 20. But this range was formulated by a black woman, makeup genius Pat McGrath, and eight of those 20 shades are definitively for brown-skinned girls\u2014even those with very deep hues (McGrath herself is a healthy chocolate). But the finish? Absolutely sublime. This is truly fashion for your face.\n\nMaybelline New York Fit Me! Matte + Poreless, $8: But if you want 40 shades at one eighth of the price, this should be your jam. Simple, silky, and easily accessible, this foundation is perfect for every day, and gets oil immediately under control. And there truly is a shade for everybody.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, there you have it: the faves that The Glow Up and Glamour agree should be in your beauty arsenal. That said, trust that we have a few faves of our own, so stay tuned for The Glow Up Beauty Awards later this year.

Hot on the heels of H&M\u2019s absolutely irresponsible and boycott-inducing use of a black boy to market a sweatshirt proclaiming him the \u201cCoolest Monkey in the Jungle,\u201d Italian beauty brand Wycon Cosmetics decided to up the ante.\n\nThe Milan-based beauty company, which touts over 200,000 Instagram followers, apparently thought it\u2019d be a great idea to name its new line of gel polishes after well-known R&B and hip-hop songs, including \u201cDrop It Like It\u2019s Hot,\u201d \u201cCandy Shop\u201d and \u201cBootylicious.\u201d But the company saved the most provocative for last, with its darkest nail color: a true black named \u201cThick as a Nigga.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYeah. For real, for real.\n\nAccording to writer Declan Eytan for Forbes magazine, the polish name was purportedly inspired by the song \u201cThick Nigga\u201d from artist DBangz\u2014an artist with far less popularity than Wycon, but nevertheless deemed an ideal inspirational choice for the brand.\n\n\n\nOK, sure.\n\nWycon\u2019s indelicate choice understandably\u2014and, likely, expectedly\u2014caused an uproar after a now-deleted Instagram post caught the attention of Afro-Italian entertainer and YouTube personality Loretta Grace, who rightly called out the brand on social media. In response to the torrent of criticism unleashed, the company was at first dismissive, telling one commenter, \u201cThey\u2019re made-up names that are a bit crazy\u201d (ahem, they\u2019re not \u201cmade-up\u201d if you use actual song names). But as outrage mounted, the company offered the type of tepid and tone-deaf response we\u2019ve now become all too accustomed to:\n\nWe\u2019re sorry that this post has triggered these types of reactions: every color from our Gel On collection is inspired, with a cheerful attitude and a pinch of naivety, by famous song titles, many of which derive from the landscape of hip hop . . . Wycon is the brand for everybody #nobodyexcluded is our motto and we didn\u2019t mean to offend anybody!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWycon has since scrubbed all Gel On nail polish names from its website, after undoubtedly getting the attention it wanted\u2014attention we\u2019re admittedly reluctant to add to. But in light of the well-publicized series of similar transgressions by major brands that have preceded this one, we highly doubt that the brand didn\u2019t mean to offend. In fact, we don\u2019t think Wycon cared at all, as evidenced by the response Loretta Grace received from the Italian beauty community, as told to Allure magazine:\n\nMy community was shocked about it . . . But most of the Italian beauty community said that I am exaggerating and that a lot of American rappers and singers like Nicki Minaj and Beyonc\u00e9 say the N* word on their songs so we cannot complain about it. SMDH.\n\nClearly, our shock and awe has become as marketable as our culture (we\u2019d personally love to see the brand get slapped with licensing suits for using those song names). Because in 2018, there is absolutely no excuse for this type of racial insensitivity from a cosmetics brand (or any other), other than a sheer lack of\u2014well, you know. So it\u2019s another day, another insult\u2014and ultimately, we just have one less brand to check for. Because one thing obviously hasn\u2019t hit the Italian beauty market yet, and that\u2019s the importance of the black dollar.

In 1999 she developed designer Giorgio Armani\u2019s makeup line\u2014in my opinion, still one of the top three foundation formulations and shade ranges on the market. In 2004 she was named creative director of Procter & Gamble cosmetics, which includes lines like SK-II, Dolce & Gabbana and CoverGirl. In 2013 Queen Elizabeth II named McGrath an MBE, or Member of the Order of the British Empire, for services to the fashion and beauty industries.\n\nMcGrath finally founded her own eponymous collection in 2015 based around highly pigmented lipsticks and eye shadows. Without fail, lines around the block accompany each new limited edition launch at her freestanding New York City store, and within hours, her website sells out of her flawlessly curated $125 eye shadow palettes and $38 lipsticks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI worked with McGrath and her team a month ago for the British Fashion Awards and still missed my chance to score the last two offerings of her Matte Trance lipstick and new Lip Fetish lip balm.

She has sat on the bench for almost 30 years, before that spending eight years as an assistant U.S. attorney prosecuting criminal cases in the Superior Court and the U.S. District Court.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRobinson has presided over both political and high-profile cases in Washington, D.C.\n\nIn 2005, Robinson oversaw a case that resulted in a guilty plea from former President Bill Clinton\u2019s former national security adviser Sandy Berger.

Rihanna came\u2014ferociously\u2014for all of our coins with the launch of Fenty Beauty. Flat-tummy teas were the rage of the year for Instagram celebrities. And we could not get enough of banana powder.\n\n\n\nHowever, there are a few beauty trends in 2017 that should stay right where they are. In fact, we should tar and feather them. I would even be willing to leave them at the gates of hell if this would ensure that I\u2019d never see them again. I\u2019m counting down to a new year hopefully free of these trends:\n\n5. Brazilian Butt Lifts on Spaghetti Legs\n\nWe\u2019ve all seen those perfectly round, plump backsides on our favorite A- through D-list celebrities. No need to name names; we know who they are. They perfectly fill out all of their dresses, but in a bikini or jeans, it\u2019s a different\u2014and bleak\u2014story. We bore witness to spaghetti legs damn near snapping in half under the weight of these plentiful posteriors.\n\nMy prayer for 2018 is to bring balance and a proper ass-to-thigh ratio back to the game. Amen.\n\n4. Baby Hairs\n\nWhether they\u2019re on a lace front or from your own glorious mane (insert hand claps), RETIRE THE BABY HAIRS. It\u2019s called \u201cbaby hair\u201d for a reason, baby. If you are over the age of 5, there\u2019s no reason you should be channeling your inner Ginuwine with a toothbrush and edge control.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but if you have \u201cbaby hair,\u201d your edges are probably struggling.\n\n3. Unnatural-Looking Brows\n\nBrows are natural frames for the face. I\u2019ve had a difficult time this year trying to figure out why sisters keep doing the most with their cejas. If it wasn\u2019t the \u201combre eyebrow\u201d\u2014or \u201chombre eyebrows,\u201d as I like to call them\u2014that faded at the inside of the bridge of the nose, it was a whole-ass lace front for your brows. Bruh. Ma\u2019am. Chile. Huh?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAre we really putting somebody else\u2019s hair on top of our brows? I absolutely understand; not everyone is blessed with a well-grown brow, but we have to do better. Microblade them or something. Ugh.\n\n2. The Goofy Gold Highlight on the Tip of the Nose\n\nI L-O-V-E a good ole glistening highlight! Cheeks that serve glowing, dewy realness give me the feels every time. I partake in a lively glowfest when I apply makeup. But what I\u2019m not finna do\u2014yes, finna\u2014is do that ill-placed gold dot on the tip of my nose made popular by Instagram makeup artists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMakeup should look natural\u2014or at least try. There is NOTHING NATURAL about a gold polka dot on your face that\u2019s not blended into the skin. It literally sits atop the nose like luminescent doo-doo.\n\nHighlighters, when used correctly, should cast a radiant shine onto the high points of the face when hit by natural light. Anything else is uncivilized. You cannot slay this way. I\u2019m sorry to say.\n\nAnd finally ... (Drumroll.)\n\n1. The Odd-Color-Lipstick Phase\n\nWe were bombarded by lips wearing teal, navy, green, gray, yellow, royal blue, aqua and a plethora of other Crayola colors [Editor\u2019s note: See Fenty\u2019s recent Mattemoiselle release]. Usually it was super-matchy and not very well executed. While I did see some some sisters rocking the hell out of these audacious/atrocious color palettes, for the most part, chicks just looked like they were ready to enjoy the finest Krabby Patty at the Krusty Krab in Bikini Bottom.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust, NO.\n\nWith 2018 quickly approaching, we need to start the year off right. So, until next time, remember: Friends don\u2019t let friends leave the house looking crazy.\n\n*Besos.*", "keywords": ["gold", "face", "im", "leave", "spaghetti", "natural", "nose", "baby", "black", "women", "2017", "beauty", "trends", "hair", "tip"], "polarity": 0.0801012876012876, "subjectivity": 0.5002537740037739},

Aside from being one of the longest-running fashion magazines around (79 years and counting, to be exact), it\u2019s also one of the more inclusive, featuring women of various colors, sizes and ages long before its competitors caught on.\n\n\n\nMatter of fact, we were pleased to see that its judging committee featured several of our faves on the beauty and style scene, including Felicia Walker Benson, Lacy Redway, Patrice Grell Yursik and Sai de Silva. We were equally thrilled to see a few of our favorite products validated by Glamour\u2019s list, which covered both designer and drugstore finds in skin care, hair care, and makeup\u2014even organic offerings.\n\nAnd because we love a bargain, let\u2019s start where we get the most bang for our buck: at the drugstore. While we love a good designer splurge, there are some low-cost products folks are simply sleeping on, and these are the ones both Glamour and The Glow Up agreed on:\n\nSimple Water Boost Micellar Water, $9: You want to get super clean in a few swipes? This is the product. Micellar water made big waves in 2017, but Simple\u2019s ... simple formula is among our favorites for all types of skin, containing no fragrances, color or harsh chemicals.\n\n\n\nOlay Eyes Deep Hydrating Eye Gel, $30: This pick may seem equally old-school and expensive for the drugstore, but for tired eyes (am I the only one who has those? should it be called \u201ceditor\u2019s eyes\u201d?), this is an instant fix, and just a dab will do ya. Trust, it\u2019s worth it.\n\nDove Invisible Dry Spray Antiperspirant, $5: Yeah, yeah, we know ... Dove messed up big time in 2017. But we\u2019re not ones to throw out the baby with the bath wash, so to speak, and the good this brand has done and continues to do\u2014including inclusive advertising, hiring and ongoing self-esteem workshops for underprivileged black and brown girls\u2014should not be overshadowed by an admittedly really stupid mistake.\n\nThat said, their Invisible Dry Spray is one of the best antiperspirants around, and literally keeps us looking (and smelling) clean in our white tees ... and black tees ... and red tees ...\n\nThat said, their Invisible Dry Spray is one of the best antiperspirants around, and literally keeps us looking (and smelling) clean in our white tees ... and black tees ... and red tees ... L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris Brow Stylist Definer, $9: So yeah, this is my daily go-to for my brows, which never quite grew in any glamorous fashion even before I plucked them into En Vogue-level submission in my high school and college years. Aside from the brush at one end, the dense angled retractable product at the other is never too red, too gray, too waxy, or too creamy. It goes on realistically, and stays all day. Enough said.\n\nCoverGirl LashBlast Volume, $9: LashBlast has eclipsed GreatLash as our go-to drugstore brand, and for good reason: Every variation in this line gives us the big, lush lashes we\u2019ve been looking for (or at least, me, who has absolutely anemic lashes). Two non-clumpy coats, and we\u2019re good to go!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnto the organics. As much as we hate the price point, one product line Glamour really got right was Tata Harper, who started her skin care in her own garden. This is a bite-the-bullet purchase, but I\u2019ve personally been known to hoard samples to give myself mini facials on the road.\n\nTata Harper Clarifying Moisturizer, $105: Damn it, I wish this stuff wasn\u2019t so good, but for my now confused, middle-aged, \u201cI want to dry up and break out\u201d skin, this stuff has worked wonders. Sorry, not sorry.\n\nTata Harper Clarifying Mask, $68: Also, and as well.\n\nFor curly and textured hair (first of all, can we give Glamour big ups for realizing this deserved its own category?) there were a couple of picks that hit the high and low of our budgets, but did equally amazing things for our curls:\n\nAlterna Caviar Infinite Color Hold Shampoo & Conditioner, $34 each: Yep, not cheap, but great\u2014especially for aging or overworked hair. Somehow, this miracle potion tricks my follicles into believing they\u2019re at least a decade younger. And who doesn\u2019t want that?\n\nDark and Lovely Au Naturale Anti-Shrinkage Clumping Curl Clay Cleanser, $10: Look, shrinkage is a real issue, people (take that however you want to take it), and we\u2019re grateful that someone on Dark and Lovely\u2019s chemistry team saw this problem and sought to solve it. This product truly puts the coils in curls, and gives definition where frizz wants to flourish. We\u2019re here for it.\n\nDove Refresh+Care Unscented Dry Shampoo, $4: Yep, Dove came so nice, they made it twice, and we promise you, if you\u2019re don\u2019t already, dry shampoo is the one product you should include in your arsenal. Workout hair? Dry shampoo. Need volume at the roots? Dry shampoo. Too much product weighing you down? Dry shampoo. And for $4, can you really afford not to experiment a bit?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor makeup, we only found two that found us completely in agreement with Glamour, at both ends of our price range:\n\nGiorgio Armani Power Fabric Foundation, $64: Nope, there are aren\u2019t 40 shades, there are 20. But this range was formulated by a black woman, makeup genius Pat McGrath, and eight of those 20 shades are definitively for brown-skinned girls\u2014even those with very deep hues (McGrath herself is a healthy chocolate). But the finish? Absolutely sublime. This is truly fashion for your face.\n\nMaybelline New York Fit Me! Matte + Poreless, $8: But if you want 40 shades at one eighth of the price, this should be your jam. Simple, silky, and easily accessible, this foundation is perfect for every day, and gets oil immediately under control.

Before you object to my use of the word \u201cslave,\u201d let us be clear: I do not mean \u201cslave\u201d in the way you are thinking.\n\nI am not trying to invoke the pain and trauma of our ancestors in a hyperbolic comparison. When I write \u201cslave,\u201d I am not using it in the narrow sense of the mid-Atlantic holocaust perpetrated against African people. I\u2019m using it in the correct sense. I\u2019m using it according to the definition of the word. I\u2019m using it according to every definition of the word.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Oxford Dictionary defines a slave as:\n\nA person who is the legal property of another and is forced to obey them. 1.1 A person who works very hard without proper remuneration or appreciation. 1.2 A person who is excessively dependent upon or controlled by something. 1.3 A device, or part of one, directly controlled by another.\n\nAccording to ESPN, which is keeping a week-by-week tally of which professional football players protest this season during the playing of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner,\u201d this past Sunday only 10 NFL players participated in protesting racial inequality by kneeling or refusing to stand during the national anthem\u2014the fewest this season. Other players protested by raising fists during the song, staying in the tunnel or demonstrating before the anthem.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday at 6 p.m., ESPN will air another version of Sportscenter, the network\u2019s most popular version of its flagship program, without anchor Jemele Hill. Hill is serving a two-week suspension for tweets that the company said violates its social media policy.\n\nWhen Sportscenter hits the air, one of the lead stories will probably be about the University of Louisville\u2019s decision on whether it will fire head coach Rick Pitino. Pitino has been implicated in a FBI investigation that alleges that he and a number of officials at other NCAA colleges paid third parties hundreds of thousands of dollars to secure recruits to their individual university athletics programs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are some who will counter that the decrees of these organizations are no different from the rules and contractual obligations of any other employer for any other company. They are correct. But here is the difference between the NFL, ESPN and NCAA and other organizations:\n\nThe NFL\u2019s black players are not being disciplined because of infractions. The NCAA is not cherry-picking which coaches to target for violating NCAA rules. Hill is not being censured for breaking ESPN\u2019s policy. Each of these entities knows that it cannot profit without the absolute control of the livestock whose talent and toiling line the pockets of the overseers. The suspensions, fines and proposed benchings are not a play for order and fairness. They are meant to assert control. They are proclamations of ownership.\n\nA person who is the legal property of another and is forced to obey them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSlavery has absolutely nothing to do with pay. It is about ownership. It is about control.\n\nOn Tuesday, Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said: \u201cThe policy and my actions are going to be if you don\u2019t honor and stand for the flag in a way that a lot of our fans feel that you should, if that\u2019s not the case, then you won\u2019t play.\u201d Jones is within his rights to do so because of a quiet change in NFL policy that allows the league and individual owners to discipline players for not standing for the anthem.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRoughly 80 percent of the NFL\u2019s players are black. One hundred percent of the NFL\u2019s majority owners are white. But this issue is not about color; nor does it have anything to do with the flag or the anthem. It is about a group of billionaires knowing that they cannot allow the bodies they ostensibly \u201cown\u201d to coalesce into a united, vocal force. It is about stamping out rebellion and resistance.\n\nIt is about forcing their legal property to obey.\n\nThis is the same with ESPN and Jemele Hill. ESPN claims that Hill violated its social media policy by tweeting her opinions from her personal social media account. ESPN\u2019s policy states:\n\nWriters, reporters, producers and editors directly involved in \u201chard\u201d news reporting, investigative or enterprise assignments and related coverage should refrain in any public-facing forum from taking positions on political or social issues, candidates or office holders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile it is debatable whether Hill is considered a \u201creporter,\u201d ESPN\u2019s rules also say:\n\nOutside of \u201chard\u201d news reporting, commentary related to political or social issues, candidates or office holders is appropriate on ESPN platforms consistent with these guidelines.\u201d The topic should be related to a current issue impacting sports.\n\nESPN pays Hill, in part, because she is black and outspoken. The network monetized her unapologetic blackness in the same way the NFL capitalizes on its mostly black workforce. According to AdAge, since ESPN moved Hill and co-host Michael Smith to their flagship program, the show\u2019s audience is 12 years younger and has increased its Hispanic and African-American audience by 39 percent, attracting better and higher-paying advertisers. Never forget how the network chose to promote the new, hip SC6 when it named Hill and Smith as anchors:\n\nESPN wants the unapologetic blackness without the unapologetic part. Or the black part. To ensure that, the network twisted its rules and contorted itself into a bullwhip to make sure Hill knows what not to say. How not to act. If she is to be the network\u2019s legal property, it wants to make sure she knows that she should obey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCollege athletes are no different. The FBI investigation that claimed Pitino\u2019s inviolability arbitrarily focused on a group of schools where boosters were funneling money between coaches, sports agents and shoe companies to get top recruits to commit to certain colleges. You know who wasn\u2019t making any money?\n\nCollege players.\n\nAlmost every analyst and expert who covers college sports says that these kinds of deals take place at almost every high-profile university athletic program. The NCAA, like the NFL and ESPN, selectively enforces its rules to ensure the steady flow of free labor that enriches the institution without compensating the players\u2014or, as the definition of slavery says, \u201cwithout proper remuneration or appreciation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen an investigation exposed the University of North Carolina\u2019s sham African-American-studies program that gave athletes fake grades for 18 years, absolutely nothing happened. When poor black students complete four years of eligibility without a degree after making millions for their colleges, absolutely nothing happens. College athletes can\u2019t obtain outside employment without permission. They can\u2019t leave the plantation schools if their current college won\u2019t allow it. They are \u201cexcessively dependent\u201d on their universities.\n\nWhen Donald Trump suggested that ESPN should terminate Jemele Hill or that NFL owners should fire \u201cthat son of a bitch\u201d who \u201cdisrespects our flag,\u201d he knew what he was doing. It wasn\u2019t simply a call to white supremacists who wrap themselves in patriotism because it is the \u201clast refuge of the scoundrel.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a dog whistle to his base.\n\nIt was a plea to make America great again. It was a not-so-subtle reminder that no matter how rich, successful, talented or accomplished a black person in America may be ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\n... that black person can still be a slave.", "keywords": ["rules", "espn", "hill", "nfl", "jerry", "jones", "players", "black", "jemele", "system", "ncaa", "slave", "person", "social", "policy"], "polarity": 0.040663910831436605, "subjectivity": 0.43705389684771123},

They want everyone else in America to see us as a threat so that when we are killed with impunity, no one bats an eyelash. This is already happening anyway.\n\nIn a country that was founded on the principles of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, it appears that you can fully reap those benefits only if you are not black, and if you are black and want those benefits, then you need to keep your mouth closed so that you can have the illusion of getting them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe new buzz phrase is \u201cblack identity extremists,\u201d and since it has been coined by the FBI, we can accurately assume that this is COINTELPRO 2.0. It will not stop here. They are painting us with a wide brush and making us the enemy because we dare demand equal treatment and justice. They are already finding multiple ways to create punitive damages for black people who speak out against injustice.\n\nThey want to silence black resistance, so they label it something big and scary that serves as a dog whistle to a certain base. They do this while simultaneously normalizing white supremacist and white nationalist ideology.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack people wanting justice and equality is considered \u201cextreme,\u201d while a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., complete with torches, Nazi insignia and an innocent woman being killed, is normal.\n\nAs someone said on Twitter, all we have asked is for the repeated killing of unarmed black men and women by police to stop and for justice in those cases where it does happen. This, it seems, has caused white America to lose its collective mind.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeing unapologetically black, asserting that black lives matter (the \u201ctoo\u201d is silent) and fighting for our basic human rights isn\u2019t extremism; it is the foundation this country was founded on, and these are the principles that the flag they claim is under attack represents.\n\nBut apparently that is only OK when it\u2019s white people exercising those rights.\n\nThe new plantation system is fully engaged. Instead of a whip, they attack our character and our livelihoods. Consider the case of Jemele Hill.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nESPN suspended her earlier this week because she said in a tweet that the best way to respond to Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones\u2019 demand that all of the team\u2019s players stand during the national anthem was to go after his advertisers. Nothing gets white people\u2014especially white people in positions of extreme power\u2014angrier than going after their bag, so they went after hers.\n\nThe president of the United States found time in his busy schedule to directly attack her\u2014a black woman and a journalist who operates under the presumption of freedom of speech\u2014on Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe is not the first, and she won\u2019t be the last.\n\nThey already iced Colin Kaepernick out and took his bag, making it impossible for him to play in a league he worked so hard to get into, and he didn\u2019t even say a gotdamn thing. He simply knelt during the national anthem and explained to those who asked why he was kneeling. He wanted justice. He wanted black lives to matter.\n\nApparently that is too much to ask.\n\nThey want your Colins and your Jemeles to stop talking so loud with all their uppity learning, getting all the other darkies riled up. There\u2019s no place for that here. Just be glad you are being allowed to earn a living and stay in your place. There\u2019s no need for you to be going around causing all this trouble.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExcept we aren\u2019t the ones causing the trouble; we are simply seeking an end to it.\n\nThe shaky premise of the entire \u201cblack identity extremists\u201d narrative is that in response to the unending cycle of black lives being cut down by police who are never punished, black people will react with violence against police. This is a false-flag attack. There is data that directly contradicts this narrative. The fact is, the number of police officers killed on the job (pdf) is far lower than the number of civilians killed by police, and when police are killed by citizens, statistics suggest that it is more often by white perpetrators than black.\n\nBlack Lives Matter demonstrations are not violent. There are no torches. No one is being attacked except, usually, the demonstrators themselves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe can\u2019t talk about justice. We can\u2019t march for justice. We can\u2019t kneel for justice and we can\u2019t tweet for justice.\n\nAll of these things are being treated as extreme, when, in fact, they are not.\n\nWhat is extreme is the narrative being crafted to make black people appear as though they are somehow in the wrong for wanting the same rights and treatment as everyone else: freedom of speech, freedom of the press and equal protection under the law.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd because the internet exists, those presenting this narrative are able to get this propaganda out faster and spread it far and wide in a way they weren\u2019t able to do in the days of Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X and the original Black Panther Party.\n\nThe base they are appealing to and using this dog whistle for exists in a media vacuum. As this message gets repeated over and over again by the FBI, the alt-Reich \u201calt-right\u201d media and the president himself, it becomes a call to action for them.\n\nAnd because their ideology is being normalized, no one will be shocked or surprised when they act out in racially motivated attacks against us. Hell, no one is surprised when it happens now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey want us to appear to be the enemy on our own soil because doing so allows their white supremacist system to continue to exist. All of these acts against black people and the Movement for Black Lives are the real extremism.\n\nBut because the voices speaking out against it are largely black, no one is listening.\n\n(Shoutout to Feminista Jones by way of @N7IRL for inspiring this headline with her Twitter display name.)", "keywords": ["bie", "human", "white", "basic", "killed", "cant", "felicia", "black", "isnt", "extremism", "lives", "narrative", "attack", "way", "justice", "extreme", "rights", "fighting"], "polarity": -0.009294426747256933, "subjectivity": 0.4409625228021452},

Cosmetics brand Prescriptives, founded in 1979, rose to prominence in the 1990s with its custom-blended foundations, allowing customers to incorporate their chosen finish and coverage into their custom-matched foundation shade, blended specifically for them.\n\nIt was, at the time, a novel concept and, seemingly, an excellent business concept, too. But it proved not to be a sustainable one; the brand was temporarily shuttered by parent company Est\u00e9e Lauder in 2010, only to be revived as an online-only offering a year later, solely in response to the demand from its still-devoted following.\n\nOf course, the makeup game has changed considerably in the years since, with full-spectrum foundation lines increasingly becoming the expectation rather than the exception. Lines like Make Up Forever, MAC and Color Fx, and even drugstore faves L\u2019Oreal and Maybelline, have increasing expanded their foundation lines to be more inclusive.\n\nBut a month before Fenty Beauty wowed us with a much-lauded 40-color foundation launch, L\u2019Oreal-owned Lanc\u00f4me upped the inclusion ante with Le Teint Particulier, a customizable foundation available in 8,000 shades and 72,000 unique coverage- and moisture-level formulations. It is currently available exclusively at select Nordstrom stores in the U.S.\n\nThe cosmetics behemoth wisely took its show on the road this year to South by Southwest, bringing the customizable experience to the crowds at the annual conference and festival that merges technology, film, music and interactive media. It\u2019s a fitting setting for this tech-forward offering from Lanc\u00f4me, and here\u2019s how it works: A Lanc\u00f4me beauty specialist uses a handheld device called a color spectrometer to scan the client\u2019s bare face in three places. The device bounces light off the skin, \u201creading\u201d the skin tone. The specialist enters those results into a tablet app, coupled with finish preferences, and a custom formula is mixed within minutes\u2014not unlike having paint mixed at your local hardware store.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor an extra-personalized touch, each bottle is labeled with the client\u2019s name and specific shade ID for easy reordering. (L\u2019Oreal says that all identifiable client data is scrubbed after point of purchase, and the resulting anonymous data is used to further product development.)\n\nGuive Balooch, global vice president of L\u2019Oreal\u2019s technology incubator, told AdWeek: \u201cWhen you look at all these companies talking about making more shades, the reality is that there\u2019s way more skin tones than there could ever be in a supply chain. My team, working with engineering firms, created what could only be made in a lab or factory setting right at the point-of-sale.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nL\u2019Oreal\u2019s SkinCeuticals brand is also in on the SXSW action; its Custom DOSE (Diagnostic Optimization Serum Experience) will launch a line of customized face serums, created for dermatologists to use, in June. This process relies on a questionnaire to determine the skin\u2019s specific needs. The answers are again entered into a tablet app, and using 2,000 algorithms, the serum is custom-mixed and labeled for each client.\n\nNow, of course, this level of personalized attention doesn\u2019t come cheap; a 1- ounce bottle of Lanc\u00f4me\u2019s Le Teint Particulier retails for $88, while SkinCeuticals serums currently retail for almost twice that price, on average. So while our curiosity is definitely piqued about the possibility of a couture cosmetic experience, perhaps the real question is, what\u2019s it worth to find your perfect match?", "keywords": ["sxsw", "skills", "makeup", "tablet", "customfoundation", "skin", "lines", "brand", "experience", "color", "foundation", "technology", "lanc\u00f4me", "teint", "shows", "madetomeasure"], "polarity": 0.22110119047619045, "subjectivity": 0.4642261904761905},

It\u2019s my favorite sport to watch. Of all the professional sports leagues, I was most invested in the NFL, and while you could find me in the trap, you could also find me sitting in front of my television religiously every Sunday watching whatever football games were on.\n\nI seem to have lost that loving feeling. Temporarily, at least. And those six downs I\u2019ve seen? I recently flew down to New Orleans, and the Thursday-night game was on in the airport.\n\nSo why am I less invested? Is it because I\u2019m tired of the players taking a stand and invoking politics in football? Of course not. I\u2019m all for that shit. Hell, I both have a Colin Kaepernick jersey AND copped one of the #IMWITHKAP T-shirts from his website. Fight all the powers. I want them to keep doing it. In fact, I want them to ENTIRELY and collectively all kneel JUST to stick it to Roger Goodell, who thinks that now is the time for everybody to stand for the anthem.

If you are truly distracted and incensed by a bunch of black men giving a fuck about something OTHER than football utilizing the only platform you people\u2014yes, you people\u2014respect, then I feel sorry for your mothers.

Y\u2019all give more of a fuck about \u201cSweet Caroline\u201d than singing the national anthem.\n\nSure, everybody stands up and either takes a hat off or places their hand over their heart, but that\u2019s probably because you were taught to do that in elementary school and it\u2019s a force of habit. But I find it hard to believe that everybody really gives THIS much of a fuck about the flag or the national anthem. Some do. But this many? Please. This is like those moments where you don\u2019t really care about shit until somebody else doesn\u2019t fuck with it, then you decide you fuck with it hardbody ONLY because they don\u2019t fuck with it, like Kid Rock or kale.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhite people: Seriously, y\u2019all spend so much time acting like this ain\u2019t black folks\u2019 country\u2014how can you be mad when we don\u2019t give a shit about the symbols of it?

Tubman, please. But somehow, again, black men giving a shit about themselves distracts you all from the truly important reason for the gathering\u2014 patriotism football.\n\nShit, so yeah, I entirely lost my point. But that\u2019s kind of the point. It\u2019s been hard for me to get excited for the football season because of everything surrounding it and just how fucking white the country has gone over football. Obviously, football is a white-consumer sport\u2014those white dollars drive the television contracts. But everybody from the owners to the commissioner to the president to ESPN to all of these folks butt-hurt over a respectful, PEACEFUL, nonviolent protest are what\u2019s ruining football (such that it\u2019s ruined), not the players.\n\nThis whole country was founded on white people\u2019s lack of respect for others (rape, pillage and murder of indigenous peoples) and their fucking protest and conquest for religious freedom.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFreedom.\n\nHow come when groups that have been historically persecuted by the very fuckers who took their religious freedom into their own hands just say, \u201cHey man, shit still sucks \u2019round here\u2014we\u2019re going to quietly address this,\u201d it\u2019s time to call up Bull Connor\u2019s corpse and get the dogs out again? Over a fucking sideline peaceful protest. White people were throwing Lipton into the waters of Lake Minnetonka Boston Harbor. Tea, fam. Throwing away perfectly good nonperishable items. How come white people forget their own history when it comes time for others to, ya know, get some of that freedom shit?\n\nBut again, this is my point. All of this has nothing to do with football. When I think football now, I think of bullshit and bullshit people and white folks white-folkin\u2019 like they\u2019ve never white-folked before. And it just makes me not feel like paying attention. Also, my team is the Washington Racists. So there\u2019s that ball of wax, too. I honestly have no idea what their record is or their standing in the NFC East.

Aside from being one of the longest-running fashion magazines around (79 years and counting, to be exact), it\u2019s also one of the more inclusive, featuring women of various colors, sizes and ages long before its competitors caught on.\n\n\n\nMatter of fact, we were pleased to see that its judging committee featured several of our faves on the beauty and style scene, including Felicia Walker Benson, Lacy Redway, Patrice Grell Yursik and Sai de Silva. We were equally thrilled to see a few of our favorite products validated by Glamour\u2019s list, which covered both designer and drugstore finds in skin care, hair care, and makeup\u2014even organic offerings.\n\nAnd because we love a bargain, let\u2019s start where we get the most bang for our buck: at the drugstore. While we love a good designer splurge, there are some low-cost products folks are simply sleeping on, and these are the ones both Glamour and The Glow Up agreed on:\n\nSimple Water Boost Micellar Water, $9: You want to get super clean in a few swipes? This is the product. Micellar water made big waves in 2017, but Simple\u2019s ... simple formula is among our favorites for all types of skin, containing no fragrances, color or harsh chemicals.\n\n\n\nOlay Eyes Deep Hydrating Eye Gel, $30: This pick may seem equally old-school and expensive for the drugstore, but for tired eyes (am I the only one who has those? should it be called \u201ceditor\u2019s eyes\u201d?), this is an instant fix, and just a dab will do ya. Trust, it\u2019s worth it.\n\nDove Invisible Dry Spray Antiperspirant, $5: Yeah, yeah, we know ... Dove messed up big time in 2017. But we\u2019re not ones to throw out the baby with the bath wash, so to speak, and the good this brand has done and continues to do\u2014including inclusive advertising, hiring and ongoing self-esteem workshops for underprivileged black and brown girls\u2014should not be overshadowed by an admittedly really stupid mistake.\n\nThat said, their Invisible Dry Spray is one of the best antiperspirants around, and literally keeps us looking (and smelling) clean in our white tees ... and black tees ... and red tees ...\n\nThat said, their Invisible Dry Spray is one of the best antiperspirants around, and literally keeps us looking (and smelling) clean in our white tees ... and black tees ... and red tees ... L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris Brow Stylist Definer, $9: So yeah, this is my daily go-to for my brows, which never quite grew in any glamorous fashion even before I plucked them into En Vogue-level submission in my high school and college years. Aside from the brush at one end, the dense angled retractable product at the other is never too red, too gray, too waxy, or too creamy. It goes on realistically, and stays all day. Enough said.\n\nCoverGirl LashBlast Volume, $9: LashBlast has eclipsed GreatLash as our go-to drugstore brand, and for good reason: Every variation in this line gives us the big, lush lashes we\u2019ve been looking for (or at least, me, who has absolutely anemic lashes). Two non-clumpy coats, and we\u2019re good to go!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnto the organics. As much as we hate the price point, one product line Glamour really got right was Tata Harper, who started her skin care in her own garden. This is a bite-the-bullet purchase, but I\u2019ve personally been known to hoard samples to give myself mini facials on the road.\n\nTata Harper Clarifying Moisturizer, $105: Damn it, I wish this stuff wasn\u2019t so good, but for my now confused, middle-aged, \u201cI want to dry up and break out\u201d skin, this stuff has worked wonders. Sorry, not sorry.\n\nTata Harper Clarifying Mask, $68: Also, and as well.\n\nFor curly and textured hair (first of all, can we give Glamour big ups for realizing this deserved its own category?) there were a couple of picks that hit the high and low of our budgets, but did equally amazing things for our curls:\n\nAlterna Caviar Infinite Color Hold Shampoo & Conditioner, $34 each: Yep, not cheap, but great\u2014especially for aging or overworked hair. Somehow, this miracle potion tricks my follicles into believing they\u2019re at least a decade younger. And who doesn\u2019t want that?\n\nDark and Lovely Au Naturale Anti-Shrinkage Clumping Curl Clay Cleanser, $10: Look, shrinkage is a real issue, people (take that however you want to take it), and we\u2019re grateful that someone on Dark and Lovely\u2019s chemistry team saw this problem and sought to solve it. This product truly puts the coils in curls, and gives definition where frizz wants to flourish. We\u2019re here for it.\n\nDove Refresh+Care Unscented Dry Shampoo, $4: Yep, Dove came so nice, they made it twice, and we promise you, if you\u2019re don\u2019t already, dry shampoo is the one product you should include in your arsenal. Workout hair? Dry shampoo. Need volume at the roots? Dry shampoo. Too much product weighing you down? Dry shampoo. And for $4, can you really afford not to experiment a bit?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor makeup, we only found two that found us completely in agreement with Glamour, at both ends of our price range:\n\nGiorgio Armani Power Fabric Foundation, $64: Nope, there are aren\u2019t 40 shades, there are 20. But this range was formulated by a black woman, makeup genius Pat McGrath, and eight of those 20 shades are definitively for brown-skinned girls\u2014even those with very deep hues (McGrath herself is a healthy chocolate). But the finish? Absolutely sublime. This is truly fashion for your face.\n\nMaybelline New York Fit Me! Matte + Poreless, $8: But if you want 40 shades at one eighth of the price, this should be your jam. Simple, silky, and easily accessible, this foundation is perfect for every day, and gets oil immediately under control. And there truly is a shade for everybody.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, there you have it: the faves that The Glow Up and Glamour agree should be in your beauty arsenal. That said, trust that we have a few faves of our own, so stay tuned for The Glow Up Beauty Awards later this year.

She had previously filed a trademark for Aneres in 2003, but that was just for a clothing line.\n\nNow U.S. Patent and Trademark Office docs reveal that she\u2019ll be offering a wide range of beauty products, from skin care, cosmetics and makeup kits to perfumes, lotions and bath soaps. She even filed a trademark for hair-care products, including normal and dry shampoos, hair sprays and hair gels.\n\nPhoto: Pascal Le Segretain (Getty Images)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliams already has a successful clothing line with HSN, which offers a wide-ranging array of looks from fringed cardigans to sports leggings. In fact, if there\u2019s one thing Williams has, it\u2019s range: She\u2019s never shied away from crop tops and bright colors, but also features stunning looks like simple, elegant sleeveless dresses with high necks and flared, pleated skirts.\n\nWith that in mind, it\u2019s no surprise that her beauty trademarks are similarly wide-ranging. And she\u2019s no slouch when it comes to business\u2014the champ is also currently Forbes\u2019 highest-paid female athlete, raking in an incredible $84 million last year [Editor\u2019s note: That\u2019s right, even while pregnant].\n\nPhoto: Elsa (Getty Images)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo how will Williams separate herself from the rest of the celeb-beauty-brand pack? Rihanna\u2019s Fenty Beauty caused a huge initial splash with its focus on inclusivity via 40 shades of foundation, overshadowing the likes of Kylie Jenner (a true Fenty 220) and her older sister Kim Kardashian (a 260 striving to be a 390).\n\nWill Williams\u2014as Fashionista speculates\u2014focus on athleisure beauty for active women?

Lots of votes were probably suppressed.\u201d It has not been a priority in mainstream post-election media coverage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe paucity of journalists of color on the campaign trail probably had something to do with that, she said. Hannah-Jones recalled being the darkest journalist in the room when she covered Hillary Clinton at a black church in North Carolina.\n\nHannah-Jones was not the only journalist of color to push back during the conference, which attracted 3,008 on its opening day, or at the 2017 News Leadership conference, which opened this week in the same Washington hotel with 350 registrants. The latter was convened jointly by the American Society of News Editors, Associated Press Media Editors and Associated Press Photo Managers.\n\nMadhulika Sikka, newly named public editor at PBS, concluded her turn on an NPR ethics panel at ONA by saying, \u201cI care less about conversations about ideology, because conversations about race and gender are not being had. . . . A lot of people of color and women feel shut down\u201d because of that lack of dialogue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the News Leadership conference on Monday, syndicated Miami Herald columnist Leonard Pitts Jr., a journalist of color like Hannah-Jones and Sikka, delivered a keynote luncheon speech urging editors to maintain their standards in the face of attacks from some that their accurate coverage is unfair to Donald Trump. (Read his speech here).\n\nThat message was seconded by international journalists who said that Trump\u2019s attacks on the U.S. media were emboldening authoritarian rulers overseas. At an ASNE panel Monday titled \u201cHow the world sees US: Press freedom in Trump era,\u201d Mahfuz Anam, editor of the Daily Star in Bangladesh, urged more introspection by the American news media. John Yearwood, chair of the International Press Institute, and Marty Steffens, IPI board member and a professor at the University of Missouri School of Journalism, said press-freedom advocates plan to visit the interior of the United States, where authorities in a city such as St. Louis have been elevated internationally as threats to a free press.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnam also said that U.S. media support for the Iraq war under George W. Bush had cost it credibility overseas.\n\nHannah-Jones\u2019 point about voter suppression is backed up by recent reports from Wisconsin and nationally.\n\nA study from the battleground state of Wisconsin \u201cestimates 16,800 or more people in Dane and Milwaukee counties were deterred from casting ballots in November because of Wisconsin\u2019s voter ID law,\u201d Patrick Marley and Jason Stein reported Sept. 26 for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe study by University of Wisconsin-Madison political scientist Ken Mayer concluded 16,800 to 23,250 voters in the two counties \u2014 the Democratic strongholds of Wisconsin \u2014 did not vote because of the voter ID law,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThe $55,000 survey was paid for with property tax money by Dane County Clerk Scott McDonell, a Democratic opponent of the law.\n\n\u201cKey portions of those surveyed said they did not vote because they did not have ID that would allow them to or did not believe the IDs they had could be used under the voting law. The study found the ID law disproportionately affected African-Americans and low-income people.\n\n\u201c \u2018As the clerk who serves the largest population of African-Americans in the state, I was shocked by the numbers and am furious to see that Jim Crow laws are alive and well,\u2019 Milwaukee County Clerk George Christenson said in a news release. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDemocrat Hillary Clinton lost to Republican Trump in Wisconsin by fewer than 23,000 votes.\n\nReporting on Clinton\u2019s new book about the campaign, \u201cWhat Happened,\u201d the Journal Sentinel\u2019s Bill Glauber wrote Sept. 12, \u201cIn discussing what she calls \u2018voter suppression,\u2019 Clinton references studies and discusses the impact the state voter ID law may have had on the result.\n\n\u201c \u2018States with harsh new voting laws, such as Wisconsin, saw turnout dip 1.7 points, compared with a 1.3-point increase in states where the law didn\u2019t change,\u2019 she writes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cShe adds that a Priorities USA study estimated \u2018that the new voter ID law helped reduce turnout by 200,000 votes (in Wisconsin), primarily from low-income and minority areas. We know for sure that turnout in the city of Milwaukee fell by 13 percent.\u2019\n\n\u201cPolitiFact Wisconsin said experts questioned the methodology of the Priorities USA study.\u201d\n\nThe voter suppression story is ongoing, media attention or not.\n\nWhile at the Nation, Ari Berman, who has written a book on the subject, told readers on May 11, \u201cTwo days after firing FBI director James Comey and creating a full-blown constitutional crisis, Donald Trump signed an executive order today creating a presidential commission on \u2018election integrity,\u2019 based on his debunked claims that millions voted illegally in 2016.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cVice President Mike Pence will be the chair and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach will be the vice chair\u2014two men with very long histories of making it harder to vote, especially Kobach. Given the lack of evidence of voter fraud, the commission seems designed for one purpose: to perpetuate the myth of fraud in order to lay the groundwork for enacting policies that suppress the vote.\n\n\u201cIf you want to know what such voter intimidation looks like, take a look at Pence\u2019s home state of Indiana, where state police in October 2016 raided the offices of a group working to register African-American and low-income voters. They seized thousands of voter-registration applications, even though only 10 were suspected to be fraudulent and no one has been charged. . . .\u201d\n\nThe Kansas City Star has frequently ridiculed Kobach\u2019s quest, editorializing in July that his \u201cquixotic search for virtually nonexistent voter fraud has alternately frustrated and amused Kansans for years.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJournalism students have been among the debunkers of the idea of voter fraud. In 2012, students at the News21 project at the University of Arizona found, \u201cA News21 analysis of 2,068 alleged election-fraud cases since 2000 shows that while fraud has occurred, the rate is infinitesimal, and in-person voter impersonation on Election Day, which prompted 37 state legislatures to enact or consider tough voter ID laws, is virtually non-existent.\u201d\n\nIn August, Emily L. Mahoney wrote for the project, \u201cWith the presidential election less than three months away, millions of Americans will be navigating new requirements for voting \u2013 if they can vote at all \u2013 as state leaders implement dozens of new restrictions that could make it more difficult to cast a ballot.\n\n\u201cSince the last presidential election in 2012, politicians in 20 states passed 37 different new voting requirements that they said were needed to prevent voter fraud, a News21 analysis found. More than a third of those changes require voters to show specified government-issued photo IDs at the polls or reduce the number of acceptable IDs required by pre-existing laws. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, the Online News Association announced winners of the 2017 Challenge Fund for Innovation in Journalism Education. \u201cEach project will receive $35,000 to support local news experiments.

OK\u2014given the price tag, it was a big \u201cI love me\u201d present, but I budget at cost-per-wear, so there\u2019s that (that\u2019s another post, for later).\n\nAnyway, I fell in love at first sight with a wool boucle collarless cocoon coat in a gorgeous burnished marigold shade from the Olsen twins\u2019 fashion line Elizabeth and James (a low-key favorite label) and have been rocking it all winter long. Not only has it brought a bright touch to otherwise gray days\u2014I also get compliments on it everywhere I go. Like, people literally stop me in the street to remark on the color, y\u2019all. Every. Single. Day.\n\nSo it was no big surprise to me when folks started calling marigold one of the colors of 2018. It\u2019s long been a personal fave of mine, evoking exotic spices, hazy summer days and just all-around saturated goodness. But imagine my delight when I discovered that Grown-ish star and perennial fave Yara Shahidi and I\u2014albeit separated by a couple of letters, generation-wise\u2014share the same great taste in outerwear (that\u2019s my coat, y\u2019all!).\n\nBut what I loved most about Yara\u2019s ensemble is that she didn\u2019t just stop at one shade of yellow; she gave us a full monochromatic spectrum, from daffodil to mustard (believe it or not, she\u2019s also wearing yellow kicks). And as one who can personally attest to yellow being my very first favorite color (seriously\u2014before I could pronounce it properly, I called it \u201clellow\u201d), it got me inspired to incorporate more sunshine shades into my wardrobe this spring and summer when my beloved wool topper is relegated to the closet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut who are we kidding? Spring starts tomorrow, so now is the time! My colleague Corey Townsend often says, \u201cBlack women invented the color yellow\u201d; I\u2019d say that if it wasn\u2019t invented by us, it was, at the very least, invented for us. I mean, who else pulls off yellow\u2014all shades\u2014better than brown-skinned ladies?\n\nScreenshot: YouTube\n\nAnd yes, I do mean all shades of brown-skinned ladies; I promise there\u2019s a yellow just right for you. Hint: Lighter-skinned ladies tend to look better in saturated hues and orange- or green-tinted yellows like saffron and ochre than buttery shades. But the more melanin, the more options\u2014which is why Viola Davis, Lupita Nyong\u2019o and Danai Gurira look amazing in any color they wear.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut if you\u2019re still hesitant to consider yellow a go-to when it comes to your sartorial choices, we\u2019ve provided a little celebrity inspiration to get you going. Yellow will be at all your fast-fashion retailers this spring; maybe it\u2019s time to reconsider what this hue can do for you!", "keywords": ["sunshine", "spring", "images", "yellow", "shades", "invented", "hello", "love", "color", "tis", "winter", "wool", "serve", "season", "getty"], "polarity": 0.20554684309401292, "subjectivity": 0.4315951972555746},

Since 2011, The Root has proudly honored the best and brightest African Americans between the ages of 15 and 22, the brilliant and inspirational leaders who are already charting their own paths in the worlds of business, science and tech, the arts, social justice and the environment. At a time when there is a void in leadership in Washington, D.C., and beyond, these Young Futurists are stepping up to show the world that, regardless of their age, they are ready and willing to lead the way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmong this year\u2019s honorees: photographers Myles Loftin and Quil Lemons, who are using their creativity to rewrite the prevailing narrative around masculinity and black boys, who are often tossed aside by a society that labels them thugs and criminals.\n\n\n\nThere is Essynce Moore, who at 15 years old, has already written three books (that are required reading in several school districts), launched a fashion and beauty line, opened a spa and spoken to thousands around the country. It bears repeating that she is only 15.\n\n\n\nGeorge Hofstetter is using technology to help black children avoid brutal confrontations with the police, with his app CopStop. The app allows users to record their interactions with police\u2014providing a different perspective than that of police bodycams or a recording when there are no bodycams at all\u2014as well as teaches young people how to interact with police.\n\n\n\nAt 9 years old, Zandra Cunningham started her own natural skin-care line called Zandra Beauty.

Thankfully, one of her earliest instructors quickly realized that and told her she should try speedskating.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the time, Maame had just moved to the United States from Accra, Ghana, to live with her dad, Kweku. Then, in January 2017, she won a bronze medal in the 500-meter short-track race at the World Junior Championships in Austria. Fast-forward to just three months ago, and Maame made history by becoming the first black woman to qualify for a U.S. Olympic speedskating team. And she\u2019s only 18 years old.\n\n\u201cBeing the first African-American girl on this Olympic team is really awesome because then that means that young African-American girls\u2014or any race for that matter\u2014could go out there, find an ice rink, and just skate and try it out because you never know, you could be the next Olympian, which is an awesome thing to be,\u201d she told CNN.\n\nWith a smile that lights up a room and a belly-aching laugh that is filled with joy, Maame quickly became a fan fave to watch at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. She competed in the 500-meter and the 1,500-meter races. Maame finished fourth in the quarterfinals for the 500-meter race, and last place in her 1,500-meter heat. But those losses didn\u2019t slow her down at all. She\u2019s already looking forward to Beijing 2022.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarlier this month, she won gold in the 500-meter event at the World Junior Short Track Championships in Poland, becoming the first American woman to win a junior championship and the first American to win a junior title in short-track speedskating since J.R. Celski in 2009.\n\nAside from skating, Maame hopes to one day become a chemical engineer, according to Team USA\u2019s website. And no matter what life throws at her, she\u2019s always ready with a smile across her face.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI love having people smile and laugh because if you\u2019re smiling and laughing, then that means you\u2019re happy, and being happy ... is the best present you can ever give to anyone every single day, so I love doing that,\u201d she told CNN.\n\nGraphic: GMG, Photo: Myles Loftin\n\nQUIL LEMONS\n\nCategory: Arts and Culture\n\nAge: 20\n\nHometown: Philadelphia\n\nEducation: The New School\n\nSocial Media: Twitter, Facebook, Instagram\n\nQuil Lemons is breaking the so-called \u201crules\u201d of masculinity. The 20-year-old photographer started a photo series in 2016 called Glitterboy, inspired by Frank Ocean\u2019s music video for \u201cNikes.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShortly after the video\u2019s release, Quil was at a Milk Makeup launch party and wanted to \u201cshine and shine and shine\u201d just like Ocean, a real glitterboy. After posting a selfie to Instagram, with the caption that \u201creal\u201d men wear makeup, he decided to start a portrait/interview series with black men about masculinity. Every boy or man in the project, whether straight or gay, wears makeup in their shot, in front of a pink background.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important to have a broader lens of the definition of masculinity because no two people are the same,\u201d Quil told The Root. \u201cAnd there is so much beauty in being black; there is so much beauty in being a black man.\u201d\n\nPeople are already taking notice of his work. He ran into SZA in 2017, and she immediately recognized him as Glitterboy. He documented New York City\u2019s Pride Festival for Vogue and will soon begin work with the Conde Nast publication Them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQuil has received mixed reactions from people on social media\u2014and offline\u2014but he knows how important it is to change the narrative around black men and masculinity.\n\n\u201cI remember I was wearing the glitter and a group of older black men saw my face,\u201d he told The Root. \u201cAt first, these men couldn\u2019t make sense of the glitter but immediately said, \u2018Man, I wish I could\u2019ve done something like this when I was your age.\u2019 I think this was the moment I realized that my art has a more substantial voice that is longing to be heard.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis year has already been busy for Quil. He walked New York Fashion Week for ASOS, which made its debut this season, and he also took Polaroid shots of the showcase. Quil also spoke on a panel with legendary Harlem designer Dapper Dan about Afrofuturism and what it means to be a black creative. Quil, who is a student at the New School, is doing more photo shoots in his hometown, Philadelphia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI just want to keep grounding myself in my creativity, just keep elevating my art and perfecting my craft.\u201d\n\nGraphic: GMG, Photo: Gabriel Rivera\n\nMYLES LOFTIN\n\nCategory: Arts and Culture\n\nAge: 19\n\nHometown: Accokeek, Md.\n\nEducation: Parsons School of Design\n\nSocial Media: Twitter, Facebook, Instagram\n\nIt all started with a viral tweet. Myles Loftin was inspired to launch his Hooded photo series after seeing tweets about a simple Google search. Type in \u201cfour black teens\u201d and stereotypical\u2014and damaging\u2014images of black teens pop up; mug shots, wanted posters and teens in police custody dominate the results.\n\nMyles was determined to change the narrative.\n\n\u201cFor as long as the United States has been a country, black men have been painted as savages, criminals,\u201d Myles told the New School. \u201cThese inaccurate depictions trickle down and become ingrained in the minds of the people who see them.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, in 2017, he launched Hooded, a photo and video project that shows black men and boys smiling and hugging each other, in front of bright backgrounds and in hoodies.\n\n\u201cThe video and photographs show black boys who are happy, emotional and positive rather than the traditional stereotype, which paints black males in hoodies as being hardened, intimidating criminals,\u201d he told Vice. \u201cIt\u2019s important that black people, and people of color in general, are accurately represented.\u201d\n\nIn the short film included in the project, he cut together audio from Hillary Clinton\u2019s infamous \u201csuper predator\u201d speech and the 911 call made by George Zimmerman before he fatally shot 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, highlighting the language people too often use to describe young black people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 19-year-old student at Parsons has received widespread acclaim for his work, traveling to the Netherlands to speak about his art and giving a presentation at Yale. Myles has also created several photo projects on his personal website, including Here and Genderqueer, with his frequent collaborator, genderqueer artist Chella Man, and \u201980s Prom Portraits, a series of photos of local artists in Washington, D.C., Maryland and Virginia.\n\n\u201cMe being a successful black photographer is one way of rebellion against the media, which is trying to portray a different image of what black boys are,\u201d he said, the Huffington Post reported.\n\nGraphic: GMG, Photo: Juliet Lubwama\n\nJULIET LUBWAMA\n\nCategory: Arts and Culture\n\nAge: 17\n\nHometown: Downingtown, Pa.\n\nEducation: Downingtown STEM Academy\n\nSocial Media: Instagram\n\nJuliet Lubwama started writing poetry in the fourth grade after reading Maya Angelou\u2019s \u201cPhenomenal Woman.\u201d Fast-forward eight years and the 17-year-old poet has already earned national acclaim. In 2017, she was named one of five National Student Poets, as which she will serve as a literary ambassador for the Northeast region.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJuliet\u2019s poetry is centered on her identity as an African and a black American. Her parents are Ugandan immigrants, and she and her siblings were born in the United States. In \u201cTrying to Find Home,\u201d she explores the idea of belonging in these lines: \u201cmy kin arrived with textbooks swaying on their heads/ and shackles round their ankles/ still, in a land we have yet to call home.\u201d In \u201cGood Hair,\u201d Juliet eloquently unpacks the politics of hair with this: \u201cauntie tugs hot comb through hair as if tearing out heritage/ rests my head on her knee at a forty five degree angle/ as she turns unmanageable, imperfect, into adequate.\u201d\n\nAt Downingtown STEM Academy, she gets to explore her second love, neuroscience, and hopes to one day go to medical school. For now, the high school senior plans to host poetry workshops at local hospitals, she told The Root, helping to \u201cintroduce poetry as a form of emotional and mental healing.\u201d More than anything, she hopes she can spread her love for the written word as far as possible, and that other young people are inspired to speak out, too.\n\n\u201cI feel that too often, young people\u2019s voices are diminished and seen as [not valuable],\u201d Juliet told The Root. \u201cHowever, we form our world\u2019s future, and as a result, our voices and messages carry extraordinary weight, whether they be communicated through poetry, public speaking or any other form of the arts.\u201d\n\nGraphic: GMG, Photo: Rebecca Cabage (Invision/AP)\n\nSTORM REID\n\nCategory: Arts and Culture\n\nAge: 15 in July\n\nHometown: Atlanta\n\nSocial Media: Twitter, Facebook, Instagram\n\nThe message that representation matters cannot be overstated. Ava DuVernay\u2019s highly anticipated film A Wrinkle in Time, based on the 1962 fantasy novel by Madeleine L\u2019Engle, is the latest example. The book tells the story of Meg Murry, a teenage girl who travels on an adventure to rescue her father who is stuck in an alternate universe. Of course, the character in the book\u2014and the 2003 TV movie\u2014has always been portrayed as white.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUntil now. Storm Reid, who has appeared in 12 Years a Slave and Sleight, is remarkable in the film, which was released in theaters March 9. With Wrinkle, little girls everywhere get to see a black girl fly across galaxies in an adventure that also doubles as a coming-of-age story.\n\n\u201cI feel like we\u2019re making a movement and it\u2019s so powerful,\u201d Storm told Dazed magazine about A Wrinkle in Time. \u201cWe\u2019re all inspiring girls of color and African-American people to see that they\u2019re powerful, and to know they can be on-screen\u2014that they are not just a stereotype and they can be so much more powerful than they see and believe.\u201d\n\nStorm is set to have a busy 2018. She stars opposite David Oyelowo in the sci-fi thriller Only You in late 2018. In 2017, she appeared in Jay-Z\u2019s celebrity-filled music video for \u201cFamily Feud,\u201d which was also directed by DuVernay. Off-screen, she\u2019s obsessed with fashion\u2014just take a look at her Instagram page\u2014and is also outspoken about today\u2019s most pressing social-justice issues. At just 14 (she\u2019ll be 15 in July), she\u2019s already using her voice to speak up about the #TimesUp movement in Hollywood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI just feel like women should be treated equally, not only in this industry but in all industries, because unfortunately we\u2019re not,\u201d she told Teen Vogue. \u201cTo be a woman and to be using my voice for Time\u2019s Up and just showing the world and telling the world, \u2018We are here and we are valuable. And we can do good things and we can be just as great as men.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn working with powerhouse women like DuVernay and Oprah Winfrey\u2014who has hailed Storm as this generation\u2019s Judy Garland\u2014she\u2019s gained a ton of tools and knowledge to make big waves in Hollywood and beyond.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna take this world by storm,\u201d she said. \u201cPun unintended.\u201d\n\nGraphic: GMG, Photo: Enid Farber\n\nMATTHEW WHITAKER\n\nCategory: Arts and Culture\n\nAge: 16\n\nHometown: Hackensack, N.J.\n\nEducation: Manhattan School of Music, Emerson Junior-Senior High School\n\nSocial Media: Twitter, Facebook, Instagram\n\nIt\u2019s hard to not compare musical prodigy Matthew Whitaker to legendary musician Stevie Wonder. Matthew, who taught himself to play \u201cTwinkle, Twinkle Little Star\u201d at just 3 years old and plays the piano effortlessly and with so much soul, is also blind.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t let my blindness stop me,\u201d he told NorthJersey.com. \u201cI want to be a professional musician.

He has his own publishing company, has traveled to Europe, the Middle East and Asia on tour, and has earned sponsorship deals with Yamaha and Hammond. Matthew also shares his talent with his local community in Hackensack, N.J., by playing the organ at New Hope Baptist Church.\n\nThe musical prodigy has also played at the Apollo Theater multiple times\u2014to great success. He won the \u201cStars of Tomorrow\u201d competition at the Apollo when he was 9 years old, and a year later, he opened for Stevie Wonder, who gave him one of his harmonicas. In December 2016, he won Showtime at the Apollo. Matthew also plays the drums, bass and melodica and is learning to play the guitar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith so much natural musical talent, Matthew hopes to one day start his own band\u2014one in which he plays all of the instruments himself.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll call it the Matthew Whitaker One-Man Band,\u201d he told The Star-Ledger of New Jersey. \u201cI like to be the one in charge.\u201d\n\nGraphic: GMG, Photo: Mike Lewis (SwimSwam)\n\nREECE WHITLEY\n\nCategory: Arts and Culture\n\nAge: 18\n\nHometown: Lafayette Hill, Pa.\n\nEducation: William Penn Charter School\n\nSocial Media: Twitter, Instagram\n\nReece Whitley is making big waves.

Rowdy Gaines, the three-time Olympic gold medalist, told the New York Times that he\u2019s going to be the \u201cbest breaststroker in the world.\u201d\n\nAt the 2017 World Junior Championships, Reece won silver medals in the 100-meter and 200-meter breaststroke\u2014and in both races he hit a personal-best record. Reece also helped his team rally to win silver in the 400-mixed medley relay. When he was just 13, he was already smashing records in his age group, the Washington Post reports. In 2015, he was named Sports Kid of the Year by Sports Illustrated.\n\nBut Reece, who plans to attend the University of California, Berkeley, in the fall, is also very serious about his education. At the end of his junior year, he was focused on acing Advanced Placement exams and competing at the World Junior Championships.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBoth forced me to stay centered mentally in order to achieve success,\u201d he told The Root. \u201cStaying composed when the pressure is on is typically something that I need work on.\u201d\n\nAnd eyes are definitely on Reece. His name is bubbling up with Olympian swimmers like Simone Manuel, Cullen Jones and Lia Neal. Earlier in February, he broke two national high school records and lowered the national high school record in the 100-meter breaststroke. He\u2019s one of few black swimmers who have reached championship level in recent years. According to the USA Swimming Foundation, 64 percent of black children have low- to no swimming abilities. Reece recognizes that he can be an inspiration to young people just by excelling in the pool.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think as I get older ...

That, combined with her father\u2019s refusal to buy her some lip balm, inspired the start of her natural skin-care company, later named Zandra Beauty, which sells more than 40 products.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe started by selling lip balms and bath bombs at local farmers\u2019 markets. After making $82 on her first day, she declared herself the \u201crichest 9-year-old on the planet\u201d and knew that she had to keep building her business. Now, at 17, her company is worth almost $500,000. The line is sold online and in stores across the country, including Paper Source and Whole Foods.\n\nIn early March, she appeared on Good Morning America as part of its \u201cDeals and Steals\u201d segment that featured businesses owned by women.

He currently sells hoodies, track shorts, hats and T-shirts. His interest in fashion all started with his love of sneakers.\n\n\u201cThroughout high school, I noticed my classmates were always talking about shoes,\u201d Victor told The Root. \u201cIt eventually led me to learn about fashionable streetwear, which I began to purchase and collect. Streetwear and sneakers went hand in hand in my high school years and nothing has changed since.\u201d\n\nWithin a year of the launch of For the Leaux, the site had more than 100,000 visits and thousands of orders. The Houston native also gives back to his community. After Hurricane Harvey, he gave $1,000 in sales to victims of the hurricane\u2014and he told The Root, it\u2019s \u201conly just the beginning of being able to give back on a larger scale.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVictor, who is a student at the University of Texas at San Antonio, is hoping to soon give an academic scholarship through the site and is preparing to release his spring collection very soon. Starting and maintaining a business hasn\u2019t been easy, but he knows it\u2019s worth it when he sees the support from clients on social media. And though he is just 21 years old, he already has wise advice for other young people who may want to start their own business.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to be influenced and inspired nowadays just based on social media,\u201d he told The Root. \u201cMake sure you\u2019re genuinely passionate about all of your endeavors because that passion should fuel you through the tough times.\u201d\n\nGraphic: GMG, Photo: Essynce Moore\n\nESSYNCE MOORE\n\nCategory: Enterprise & Corporate Innovation\n\nAge: 15\n\nHometown: Hillside, N.J.\n\nSocial Media: Twitter, Instagram\n\nEssynce Moore is only 15 and has already appeared on a billboard in the middle of Times Square in New York City.

In June, she created Black Butterfly Box, a monthly subscription service that encourages reading and learning black history, while also promoting self-confidence in young black girls.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI feel my box is helping better represent people of color by the products we provide, but I also think it helps young girls to see me as a teenage entrepreneur and African-American woman that isn\u2019t doing something typical,\u201d she told Forbes. \u201cI think it\u2019s important for young girls to see other women of color give back to their community and build other people up.\u201d\n\nThe box includes books, toys and other accessories designed to inspire black girls and remind them that they can do and be anything they desire. In August, at the request of her little brother, she created bimonthly Black Dragonfly boxes for boys. Journi told The Root that she\u2019s received several requests for a nonbinary box and plans to begin releasing those boxes\u2014called the Black Firefly Box\u2014later this year. She also plans to launch a subscription box for college students, too.\n\nSo far, Black Butterfly Box has more than 250 subscribers. The boxes have a range of themes month to month, from black superheroes and black female activists to \u201cblack to school\u201d and \u201cnappy holidays.\u201d Within each box, at least one product is from a black-owned business. Journi\u2019s company\u2014which she started on her 17th birthday\u2014is already having an impact on kids.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe biggest lessons I have learned from my work with Black Butterfly Beautiful is that something small can make a large impact,\u201d she told The Root. \u201cI\u2019ve had so many girls tell me how my product has changed them in some way.\u201d\n\nGraphic: GMG, Photo: Victoria Barrett\n\nVICTORIA BARRETT\n\nCategory: Green Innovation\n\nAge: 18\n\nHometown: White Plains, N.Y.\n\nEducation: University of Wisconsin at Madison\n\nSocial Media: Twitter, Facebook\n\nVictoria Barrett hopes more young people start speaking up about climate change. The 18-year-old college freshman has taken her passion about the environment to the next level.

In Juliana v. the United States, Victoria mentions Superstorm Sandy, which forced her school to temporarily shut down after it flooded. New York City and its summer heat waves have made her allergies worsen. Victoria first signed on as a plaintiff in the case after participating in Global Kids, an after-school program that focuses on youth development, while she was in high school in New York City.\n\nHer work with Global Kids led her to the Alliance for Climate Education, where she was an action fellow for two years. Since then, Victoria has participated in climate marches, spoken at conferences on climate change and met with high-level officials to talk about sustainable solutions for the environment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cLetting other young people all over the country know that you don\u2019t have to be able to vote to make political change,\u201d she told The Root. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of actions that you can take, and there\u2019s a lot of power that you have as a young person, that shouldn\u2019t be wasted.\u201d\n\nGraphic: GMG, Photo: Tamera Jacobs\n\nTAMERA JACOBS\n\nCategory: Green Innovation\n\nAge: 20\n\nHometown: New York City\n\nEducation: City College of New York\n\nTamera Jacobs is doing everything she can to green her neighborhood of Far Rockaway, Queens, in New York City.

I am an organizer through the means of fundraising.\u201d\n\nThe Guyana native had a successful year of fundraising in 2017. She helped the organization raise nearly $40,000 to build out two new community gardens on a New York City Housing Authority campus. Those gardens serve more than 100 people, with 55 family-gardening plots that include rainwater-harvest systems and compost operations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Tamera first started at Rockaway Youth Task Force, she helped run its community garden, which is one of the largest youth-run gardens in New York City. It opened after Hurricane Sandy ravaged much of the Rockaway peninsula; the urban farm and community garden is on a half-acre lot and also serves as an event space, where local community members can learn about composting, pollination, environmental science and healthy eating, she said.\n\nThis year, Tamera is looking forward to becoming an official member of Queens Community Board 14. She hopes to keep fighting for economic justice in underserved communities like Far Rockaway.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe are not just leaders of the future but we are also leaders of the present,\u201d she told The Root. \u201cWe have the power to be changemakers of today and tomorrow.\u201d\n\nGraphic: GMG, Photo: La\u2019Taijah Powell\n\nLA\u2019TAIJAH POWELL\n\nCategory: Green Innovation\n\nAge: 21\n\nHometown: Minneapolis\n\nEducation: Minneapolis Community and Technology College\n\nSocial Media: Facebook\n\nYou see a food desert\n\nWe see progress\n\nAnd we strive for more\n\nPutting healthy foods in every corner store\n\nFor mines and yours\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose were just a few words from La\u2019Taijah Powell, who was one of 14 Good Food advocates who traveled to the White House to talk with policy advisers about nutrition and food equity in 2015.\n\nFor La\u2019Taijah, who is born and raised in North Minneapolis, she got tired of seeing unhealthy food options all around her. She says there were 38 fast-food restaurants within an area of 7 square miles in her neighborhood\u2014yet hardly any fresh options. (North Minneapolis is a federally designated food desert.) For the past several years, she\u2019s been the youth leader and program facilitator for Appetite for Change, a food-justice organization that was co-founded by her mother, La\u2019Tasha.

But Tamir knows we can do better\u2014and that black children deserve better.\n\n\u201cI know from my own experiences the impact of having a strong black male educator in your life, and I want to be that for someone else,\u201d he told Teach for America\u2019s One Day Magazine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor years, he\u2019d told his parents that he wanted to be a doctor\u2014but all of that changed because of the Black Male Educators for Social Justice program. He now hopes to one day teach secondary English in the Philadelphia school district.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know I wanted to be a teacher until I engaged with these black men in the fellowship who are principals, CEOs\u2014just people who exude black excellence,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce I\u2019d seen what was possible, I really wanted it for myself.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd at just 18 years old, he\u2019s already doing the work to make it happen. He\u2019s been a member of the School District of Philadelphia Superintendent\u2019s Student Advisory Council for the last three years and serves as a national student officer for Educators Rising.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUpon graduating high school this year, he plans to attend American University and major in secondary education.

I flew toward those words on Lit Cosmetics\u2019 Lit Metals Metallic Pigment Kit liquid metallic eye shadow box like a moth to a flame\u2014especially after learning that this was the same makeup used to create Oprah\u2019s look for her turn as Mrs. Which in the big-screen fantasy A Wrinkle in Time.\n\nThis water-based formulation makes it easy to use with contacts and safe for lash extensions; it\u2019s also paraben-, glycol- and alcohol-free, and its lightweight but easily buildable coverage makes it perfect for everyday wear (if you dare).\n\nApplication is an easy two-step process. First, dip the brush into the liquid adhesive and apply it to your eyelid, allowing about 30-60 seconds to dry. While it\u2019s still wet, dip the same brush into the pot of glitter\u2014which is ground so fine it looks like a powder\u2014and brush the glitter onto your lids.\n\nVoil\u00e0! The effect is instant, and the gold pigment is likely what you\u2019ve been looking for in a dry or cream shadow but could never find.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPersonally, I felt the liquid adhesive drying and tightening a little for about 15 minutes afterward, and was aware of feeling something on my lids for about a half hour before I got used to the feeling. A few tricks: Avoid the crease of your eye\u2014unless you have ample time to sit with your eyes closed, it\u2019s very difficult for the adhesive to dry in the fold in the lid, and it will feel sticky for long time. If it happens, just moisten a cotton swab with water and wipe it away. Also, make sure to comb your lashes out immediately afterward in case a stray sparkle goes rogue and lands in the base of your lashes.\n\nFor a more dimensional look, you can layer the adhesive and Lit Kit glitter over regular eye shadow. Another easy and quick day-to-night makeup transformation is to use the glitter as a liquid eyeliner\u2014it takes five minutes. For golden lids, Addicted is now my go-to color, and I used Smolder for a sleek and shimmering eyeliner. Lit Kits give you glittery glamour for $28.

Well, the NFL got that shit canceled because it didn\u2019t like how the show depicted the NFL, even though it was completely fictional and didn\u2019t even mention the NFL. That\u2019s how much power the NFL has over the sports network.\n\nHill reportedly violated ESPN\u2019s social media regulations when she suggested on Twitter that if people were upset about Jerry Jones\u2019 mandate that all Dallas Cowboys players must stand for the national anthem or be benched, they should boycott the Cowboys\u2019 advertisers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHill\u2019s tweet came weeks after she caused quite a stir for tweeting that the president of the United States is, in fact, a white supremacist. Nevertheless, ESPN decided that this second time was enough. But anyone with eyes and decent vision can tell you that Hill is being punished for her first tweet.\n\nHill is a sportscaster who was tweeting on her own free time, and her job decided to suspend her. It\u2019s happened before, and it\u2019s subjective and feels really petty even for ESPN. That should\u2019ve been it, but not when the president of the United States has the sensibilities of a petty-ass bitch.

Aside from being one of the longest-running fashion magazines around (79 years and counting, to be exact), it\u2019s also one of the more inclusive, featuring women of various colors, sizes and ages long before its competitors caught on.\n\n\n\nMatter of fact, we were pleased to see that its judging committee featured several of our faves on the beauty and style scene, including Felicia Walker Benson, Lacy Redway, Patrice Grell Yursik and Sai de Silva. We were equally thrilled to see a few of our favorite products validated by Glamour\u2019s list, which covered both designer and drugstore finds in skin care, hair care, and makeup\u2014even organic offerings.\n\nAnd because we love a bargain, let\u2019s start where we get the most bang for our buck: at the drugstore. While we love a good designer splurge, there are some low-cost products folks are simply sleeping on, and these are the ones both Glamour and The Glow Up agreed on:\n\nSimple Water Boost Micellar Water, $9: You want to get super clean in a few swipes? This is the product. Micellar water made big waves in 2017, but Simple\u2019s ... simple formula is among our favorites for all types of skin, containing no fragrances, color or harsh chemicals.\n\n\n\nOlay Eyes Deep Hydrating Eye Gel, $30: This pick may seem equally old-school and expensive for the drugstore, but for tired eyes (am I the only one who has those? should it be called \u201ceditor\u2019s eyes\u201d?), this is an instant fix, and just a dab will do ya. Trust, it\u2019s worth it.\n\nDove Invisible Dry Spray Antiperspirant, $5: Yeah, yeah, we know ... Dove messed up big time in 2017. But we\u2019re not ones to throw out the baby with the bath wash, so to speak, and the good this brand has done and continues to do\u2014including inclusive advertising, hiring and ongoing self-esteem workshops for underprivileged black and brown girls\u2014should not be overshadowed by an admittedly really stupid mistake.\n\nThat said, their Invisible Dry Spray is one of the best antiperspirants around, and literally keeps us looking (and smelling) clean in our white tees ... and black tees ... and red tees ...\n\nThat said, their Invisible Dry Spray is one of the best antiperspirants around, and literally keeps us looking (and smelling) clean in our white tees ... and black tees ... and red tees ... L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris Brow Stylist Definer, $9: So yeah, this is my daily go-to for my brows, which never quite grew in any glamorous fashion even before I plucked them into En Vogue-level submission in my high school and college years. Aside from the brush at one end, the dense angled retractable product at the other is never too red, too gray, too waxy, or too creamy. It goes on realistically, and stays all day. Enough said.\n\nCoverGirl LashBlast Volume, $9: LashBlast has eclipsed GreatLash as our go-to drugstore brand, and for good reason: Every variation in this line gives us the big, lush lashes we\u2019ve been looking for (or at least, me, who has absolutely anemic lashes). Two non-clumpy coats, and we\u2019re good to go!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnto the organics. As much as we hate the price point, one product line Glamour really got right was Tata Harper, who started her skin care in her own garden. This is a bite-the-bullet purchase, but I\u2019ve personally been known to hoard samples to give myself mini facials on the road.\n\nTata Harper Clarifying Moisturizer, $105: Damn it, I wish this stuff wasn\u2019t so good, but for my now confused, middle-aged, \u201cI want to dry up and break out\u201d skin, this stuff has worked wonders. Sorry, not sorry.\n\nTata Harper Clarifying Mask, $68: Also, and as well.\n\nFor curly and textured hair (first of all, can we give Glamour big ups for realizing this deserved its own category?) there were a couple of picks that hit the high and low of our budgets, but did equally amazing things for our curls:\n\nAlterna Caviar Infinite Color Hold Shampoo & Conditioner, $34 each: Yep, not cheap, but great\u2014especially for aging or overworked hair. Somehow, this miracle potion tricks my follicles into believing they\u2019re at least a decade younger. And who doesn\u2019t want that?\n\nDark and Lovely Au Naturale Anti-Shrinkage Clumping Curl Clay Cleanser, $10: Look, shrinkage is a real issue, people (take that however you want to take it), and we\u2019re grateful that someone on Dark and Lovely\u2019s chemistry team saw this problem and sought to solve it. This product truly puts the coils in curls, and gives definition where frizz wants to flourish. We\u2019re here for it.\n\nDove Refresh+Care Unscented Dry Shampoo, $4: Yep, Dove came so nice, they made it twice, and we promise you, if you\u2019re don\u2019t already, dry shampoo is the one product you should include in your arsenal. Workout hair? Dry shampoo. Need volume at the roots? Dry shampoo. Too much product weighing you down? Dry shampoo. And for $4, can you really afford not to experiment a bit?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor makeup, we only found two that found us completely in agreement with Glamour, at both ends of our price range:\n\nGiorgio Armani Power Fabric Foundation, $64: Nope, there are aren\u2019t 40 shades, there are 20. But this range was formulated by a black woman, makeup genius Pat McGrath, and eight of those 20 shades are definitively for brown-skinned girls\u2014even those with very deep hues (McGrath herself is a healthy chocolate). But the finish? Absolutely sublime. This is truly fashion for your face.\n\nMaybelline New York Fit Me! Matte + Poreless, $8: But if you want 40 shades at one eighth of the price, this should be your jam. Simple, silky, and easily accessible, this foundation is perfect for every day, and gets oil immediately under control. And there truly is a shade for everybody.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, there you have it: the faves that The Glow Up and Glamour agree should be in your beauty arsenal. That said, trust that we have a few faves of our own, so stay tuned for The Glow Up Beauty Awards later this year.

And she\u2019s no slouch when it comes to business\u2014the champ is also currently Forbes\u2019 highest-paid female athlete, raking in an incredible $84 million last year [Editor\u2019s note: That\u2019s right, even while pregnant].\n\nPhoto: Elsa (Getty Images)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo how will Williams separate herself from the rest of the celeb-beauty-brand pack?

Some great moments deserve a sequel, and we\u2019ve therefore done some deep investigative journalism to get the details on our favorite look of Grammy night 2018.\n\nAs previously posted, Eve was our hands-down winner of this year\u2019s awards ceremony, despite not being nominated this year (sorry, Beyonc\u00e9). Thanks to our intrepid, talented and well-connected Gizmodo Media Group family (we\u2019re talking about you, Victor Amos!), we were able to get the scoop on Eve\u2019s incredible Grammys style\u2014and, most important, how to imitate it.\n\nLet\u2019s start with that gorgeous face: Makeup artist Ernesto Casillas has been working with Eve since the promotional tour for Barbershop and counts her among his favorite clients. For her Grammys look, he rose to the occasion while not even knowing what the star would be wearing, as he tells The Glow Up:\n\nFor the look, I knew right away that I wanted to keep it pretty and somewhat classic. We didn\u2019t know exactly what outfit she was going to wear up until right before she went on, so I wanted to keep the colors neutral and paint her in a way that she would feel confident and pretty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe multihyphenate added \u201cred-carpet host\u201d to her title this year, co-hosting the evening\u2019s Grammy Red Carpet Live with Entertainment Tonight\u2019s Nancy O\u2019Dell, Kevin Frazier and Keltie Knight. To make sure the star stayed stellar-looking throughout the day, Casillas had a strategy:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCasillas also wanted to make sure the focus stayed where it belonged while his star was speaking on the red carpet:\n\nEve usually likes to opt for a nude pink lip, but I knew I wanted a midtone lip, since she was wearing a suit and would be interviewing people. I wanted the mouth to also be a focus, but not too dark, either. I lined the lips with a deep berry color and filled in with a lighter, peachier shade. I used Kat Von D\u2019s \u201cLolita\u201d lipstick and some nude gloss over that.\n\nAnd lest we forget that Eve opted to wear not one, but two d\u00e9colletage-baring blazers during the evening, Casillas certainly didn\u2019t, using Gleam Body Bronzing Lotion in shade Deep Gold on her chest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd as for that mane of perfectly tousled waves Eve was rocking over her shoulder? You can thank hairstylist Angela Christine, who\u2019s been working with Eve for over seven years and also styles her for The Talk. Christine tells The Glow Up:\n\nShe\u2019s an amazing person to work with, [and] really makes the job easy. Eve loves strong and effortless, so once she chose the suit, she wanted something that felt relaxed and beautiful at the same time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that deciding on Eve\u2019s style was effortless; Christine was ready for a big chop, but the star felt otherwise. \u201cWe actually went back and forth about the hair. ... I wanted to do a shorter, edgy cut, but she was serious about keeping it long,\u201d Christine says.\n\nAnd as for that color?

He has made this plain repeatedly and unambiguously with his words, his actions, his policies and his appointments, since his only political agenda is to retain the value of whiteness (white maleness, particularly) and reverse everything his black predecessor did.\n\nRecently, he specifically targeted his ire at the predominantly black athletes of the NFL (and NBA), calling on his friends (the white owners) and his base (the mostly white fans) to put these men in their place. And they have responded to the call from their leader. Boos, beer and even death threats rain down from the stands on those who\u2019ve decided to use the anthem to bring attention to racial injustice, and owners have ordered their employees to behave or else.\n\n\n\nOne of these edicts came from Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, who declared that any player who disrespects the flag won\u2019t play\u2014a clear line drawn in the sand and a message communicating to his fanbase and his owner (the president) that they shouldn\u2019t worry because he\u2019s getting his niggers in line.\n\nJemele Hill is perhaps, after her truth-telling tweets about Donald Trump last month, the most famous sports-media personality in the country\u2014a status that combines with her talent and her blackness to place her in a unique position to articulate exactly what\u2019s wrong with what Jerry Jones is doing and exactly how to combat it.

He\u2019s so good that although Oklahoma\u2019s Trae Young has a bigger name, Sexton will probably be picked ahead of him in the NBA draft. And while Alabama had an up-and-down season this year, that they even made it to the NCAA tournament was largely due to Sexton\u2019s play in the SEC Tournament.\n\n\n\nAnyway, they lost Saturday to Villanova, a team that\u2019s just much better than them. In a weekend full of upsets, Villanova handling Alabama was one of the few outcomes that most people rightly predicted. During the game, while Alabama was down 26 points, Sexton was called for a technical foul for taunting Villanova\u2019s Mikal Bridges. Obviously, this was not a good look, but 19-year-olds do dumb shit sometimes, and this was far from an unforgivable act.\n\nIt was also last weekend that I learned that 1) Joseph Goodman exists, 2) Joseph Goodman writes things that can be read on the internet and 3) Joseph Goodman is a living icon. If Earth is around for another 10,000 years or so, and if people are still writing about sports on the internet then, you still won\u2019t find another take worse than the one Joseph Goodman wrote on Collin Sexton.\n\nLike, remember that scene from The Matrix when Neo gets shot in the hallway and comes back to life and finally realizes he\u2019s the One and sees everything in code and stops the bullets in midair and Agent Smith rushes him and Neo starts doing some no-look, one-handed kung fu shit while making a face like \u201cThese hoes won\u2019t hold me back!\u201d and then dives into Agent Smith\u2019s chest? Well, this piece is Joesph Goodman diving into the internet\u2019s chest.\n\nIt starts with something fact-ish and smarmy, a narrative device to let everyone know that Goodman is coming from a rational and sober place. JOSEPH GOODMAN IS A MOTHERFUCKING ADULT:\n\nCollin Sexton\u2019s final action as a college basketball player was getting hit with a technical foul for taunting a superior opponent while trailing by 26 points.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen he begins his descent into full dog-whistling schoolmarm:\n\nNot exactly the last impression someone wants to make before turning pro, and probably not the type of image the University of Alabama wants to project to the rest of the country after making it back to the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2012.\n\nI\u2019m sure the state of Alabama has some bigger concerns about the image they wish to project to the rest of the country, but maybe that\u2019s just me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, Alabama made it back to the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2012 BECAUSE OF COLLIN SEXTON, THE STAR FRESHMAN POINT GUARD YOU\u2019RE ABOUT TO PLAY MAGA YAHTZEE WITH IN THIS FUCKING \u201cCOLUMN,\u201d YOU DICKWAD! Goodman goes on:\n\nClassless. Clueless. Unacceptable.\n\nHoly shit! Goodman brought out the big guns. Whenever you compose entire paragraphs with just one word, you mean business. Someone call the manager because some serious white business is about to go down. Joseph Goodman is here to write shitty takes and chew bubble gum, and he\u2019s out of bubble gum:\n\nSo, Alabama\u2019s one-and-done point guard took a seat on the bench and watched the final few minutes of his brief college career from the sidelines. Credit to Alabama coach Avery Johnson for at least getting that right on Saturday in Pittsburgh. From the bench, Sexton got a good look at what it must feel like to watch Alabama pummel, say, Coastal Carolina inside Bryant-Denny Stadium on a Saturday in the fall. Only worse. At least Nick Saban is nice enough not to run up the score on the sacrificial lambs of college football. Villanova isn\u2019t wiring $1.5 million into Alabama\u2019s bank account on Monday morning, either.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou probably have to be a seasoned reader of shitty sports takes to see what\u2019s happening here. Although the athletes in power-conference football and basketball are predominately black, basketball is generally regarded as a blacker sport. One of the reasons for this distinction is that basketball generally allows for more individual freedom and improvisation than football does. And by creating this useless juxtaposition of Collin Sexton and the University of Alabama\u2019s football team, Goodman is reminding the readers that football in general and Nick Saban (Alabama\u2019s football coach) specifically wouldn\u2019t allow such indecency.\n\nJoseph Goodman is a pillowcase filled with blueberries.\n\nGoodman follows with some more bullshit and then (finally) gets to the climax. From this point on, we should probably just start calling \u201cexcessive foreplay\u201d \u201cpulling a Joseph Goodman\u201d:\n\nOne, Alabama should be better this time next year. Yes, Sexton will be gone, but that doesn\u2019t seem like such a bad thing after watching him against a truly special team. Alabama wants to win a national championship in basketball. That doesn\u2019t happen with a 6-foot-2 point guard who wants to play isolation basketball when things get tough. Sexton wouldn\u2019t say definitively that he was going pro after Alabama\u2019s loss, but his body language screamed it at the end of regulation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAh yes. We all know that you can\u2019t win national championships with a player talented and driven and confident enough to score 38 points in a game where his team only had three players. Nope. A college basketball team with national-championship aspirations can\u2019t use players like that. Maybe if Collin Sexton wants to help the team, he\u2019d be better served selling hot sausages in the tailgate instead of playing on the court.\n\nThe rest of the piece is dumb and stupid and shitty and full of dog whistles and just reiterates what Goodman said already. The irony here is that as wrong as Goodman is, he might be right about Alabama. Next year, when Collin Sexton is in the NBA, they might be even better. But they\u2019ll be better because the returning players will be better, with another year to grow and gel. Not because their best player is gone.\n\nAnyway, Joseph Goodman is a columnist for Alabama Media Group. He\u2019s on Twitter @JoeGoodmanJr. And I know all of this because it\u2019s attached to the end of the piece, and it\u2019s the only part that makes any sense.

Paris Fashion Week ended with natural hair trending strongly on the runways, and Louis Vuitton\u2019s show was no exception. Along with showcasing natural hair, designer Nicholas Ghesqui\u00e8re returned to the house of Louis Vuitton this season after a long absence from the runways and showed his own variation of the primary colors in patchwork patterns that appeared in designer collections on almost every Fall/Winter 2018-2019 catwalk. Ghesqui\u00e8re\u2019s interpretation showed up on corset belts that are a sexy and simple-to-wear update for a fall wardrobe.\n\nBlack against primary or neon colors is also a directional color theme for fall. Vuitton illustrated a prevailing mood in fashion that sexy has its place, but only if it also somehow says power. For instance, notice a flounce of details on one side of the shirt tucked into a high-waisted belt, so as not to be over-the-top (no pun intended) sexy. And elements of menswear like tweed were feminized with beaded trims and ruffles, creating a capelet effect as a pretty version of padded power shoulders.\n\nOpera-length gloves for both day and night were another fixture in the accessories category this season. Whether in satin, leather or neoprene, they quickly elevate an outfit to fashionista status with the snap of the wrist.\n\nMeanwhile, athleisure is fading away from the fashion footrace, with sneakers being outpaced by chunky-but-elegant heels. Take note, fashion lovers: Bold straps also pick up the patchwork theme on shoes and boots. At Vuitton, other microtrends that added up to a big new look for fall were stripes, lariats and shoulder-duster earrings with statement pearls on delicate chains.\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images 1 / 10\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can check out the full Louis Vuitton presentation below and let The Glow Up know which looks you love.

Thankfully, one of her earliest instructors quickly realized that and told her she should try speedskating.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the time, Maame had just moved to the United States from Accra, Ghana, to live with her dad, Kweku.

Myles Loftin was inspired to launch his Hooded photo series after seeing tweets about a simple Google search. Type in \u201cfour black teens\u201d and stereotypical\u2014and damaging\u2014images of black teens pop up; mug shots, wanted posters and teens in police custody dominate the results.\n\nMyles was determined to change the narrative.\n\n\u201cFor as long as the United States has been a country, black men have been painted as savages, criminals,\u201d Myles told the New School. \u201cThese inaccurate depictions trickle down and become ingrained in the minds of the people who see them.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, in 2017, he launched Hooded, a photo and video project that shows black men and boys smiling and hugging each other, in front of bright backgrounds and in hoodies.\n\n\u201cThe video and photographs show black boys who are happy, emotional and positive rather than the traditional stereotype, which paints black males in hoodies as being hardened, intimidating criminals,\u201d he told Vice. \u201cIt\u2019s important that black people, and people of color in general, are accurately represented.\u201d\n\nIn the short film included in the project, he cut together audio from Hillary Clinton\u2019s infamous \u201csuper predator\u201d speech and the 911 call made by George Zimmerman before he fatally shot 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, highlighting the language people too often use to describe young black people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 19-year-old student at Parsons has received widespread acclaim for his work, traveling to the Netherlands to speak about his art and giving a presentation at Yale. Myles has also created several photo projects on his personal website, including Here and Genderqueer, with his frequent collaborator, genderqueer artist Chella Man, and \u201980s Prom Portraits, a series of photos of local artists in Washington, D.C., Maryland and Virginia.\n\n\u201cMe being a successful black photographer is one way of rebellion against the media, which is trying to portray a different image of what black boys are,\u201d he said, the Huffington Post reported.\n\nGraphic: GMG, Photo: Juliet Lubwama\n\nJULIET LUBWAMA\n\nCategory: Arts and Culture\n\nAge: 17\n\nHometown: Downingtown, Pa.\n\nEducation: Downingtown STEM Academy\n\nSocial Media: Instagram\n\nJuliet Lubwama started writing poetry in the fourth grade after reading Maya Angelou\u2019s \u201cPhenomenal Woman.\u201d Fast-forward eight years and the 17-year-old poet has already earned national acclaim.

For now, the high school senior plans to host poetry workshops at local hospitals, she told The Root, helping to \u201cintroduce poetry as a form of emotional and mental healing.\u201d More than anything, she hopes she can spread her love for the written word as far as possible, and that other young people are inspired to speak out, too.\n\n\u201cI feel that too often, young people\u2019s voices are diminished and seen as [not valuable],\u201d Juliet told The Root. \u201cHowever, we form our world\u2019s future, and as a result, our voices and messages carry extraordinary weight, whether they be communicated through poetry, public speaking or any other form of the arts.\u201d\n\nGraphic: GMG, Photo: Rebecca Cabage (Invision/AP)\n\nSTORM REID\n\nCategory: Arts and Culture\n\nAge: 15 in July\n\nHometown: Atlanta\n\nSocial Media: Twitter, Facebook, Instagram\n\nThe message that representation matters cannot be overstated. Ava DuVernay\u2019s highly anticipated film A Wrinkle in Time, based on the 1962 fantasy novel by Madeleine L\u2019Engle, is the latest example. The book tells the story of Meg Murry, a teenage girl who travels on an adventure to rescue her father who is stuck in an alternate universe.

In 2015, he was named Sports Kid of the Year by Sports Illustrated.\n\nBut Reece, who plans to attend the University of California, Berkeley, in the fall, is also very serious about his education. At the end of his junior year, he was focused on acing Advanced Placement exams and competing at the World Junior Championships.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBoth forced me to stay centered mentally in order to achieve success,\u201d he told The Root. \u201cStaying composed when the pressure is on is typically something that I need work on.\u201d\n\nAnd eyes are definitely on Reece. His name is bubbling up with Olympian swimmers like Simone Manuel, Cullen Jones and Lia Neal. Earlier in February, he broke two national high school records and lowered the national high school record in the 100-meter breaststroke. He\u2019s one of few black swimmers who have reached championship level in recent years. According to the USA Swimming Foundation, 64 percent of black children have low- to no swimming abilities.

She and her intern cohorts created a gaming app, and she finally got the real-life work experience that launched her into the start of her tech career.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince then, Sasha has had eight internships that blend technology and business. Now, as a student at Pace University studying information systems and marketing, she\u2019s already on a mission to help the next generation of students get excited about science and technology.\n\n\u201cMy desire to change the face of STEM [science, technology, engineering and math] keeps me motivated, especially when I see my efforts, as well as others, are making a difference in increasing interest among young people,\u201d Sasha told The Root.\n\nTo that end, she launched a Kickstarter campaign to raise money to publish her first book, Sasha Savvy Loves to Code, a children\u2019s book about a 10-year-old girl who wants to code. She met her goal in four days and raised more than $17,000. The book was released in June 2017.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSasha and her friends attend coding camp just like I did,\u201d Sasha said on the Kickstarter page. \u201cSasha gets frustrated when her code doesn\u2019t work just like I did and still do.

George, who is a senior at Alameda Community Learning Center, with hopes of going to the University of California at Los Angeles, knows that the work he is doing could have a great impact on marginalized communities.\n\nGeorge has been intrigued by technology for several years. At his first hackathon\u2014when he was 13\u2014he created \u201cConnect the Dots,\u201d a platform to help black students at predominantly white private schools navigate racism on their campuses. That experience is what launched him on a quest to learn more about coding and programming languages. For the past two summers, he\u2019s worked as a tech intern in the Oakland Mayor\u2019s Office.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen he was 16, George created his own tech company, George Hofstetter Technologies Inc., with a mission to \u201cchange the world\u2019s perspective on race by using technology,\u201d and he is hopeful that he can help change the demographics of Silicon Valley. George\u2019s latest venture is Up to Code, a mobile-learning technology, designed for middle schoolers, to help bridge the digital divide.\n\n\u201cThese big tech companies are creating the future and they\u2019re not including everyone,\u201d he told The Root. \u201cHow can you create a future for everyone without including everyone?

Ohio doesn\u2019t have strict standards, so each district and its superintendent can decide on its own rules. For Ose, that won\u2019t cut it, especially when it comes to educating LGBTQ youth, who are often left out of the sexual-education conversation. Everyone should have access to proper reproductive-rights education\u2014and Ose is ready to keep pressing elected officials to make it happen.\n\n\u201cWhen my conservative, anti-LGBT legislators in Ohio think about their constituency, that includes queer black youth like myself,\u201d they told The Root. \u201cI want them to know that young people like me are watching their actions and are more than ready to vote them out of office and replace them in the years to come.\u201d\n\nOse, who is set to graduate high school this spring, accepted a full-ride scholarship to Ohio State University, where they will study international relations and sexuality studies.

I can see my daughter in these kids, and I\u2019m as proud of and protective of them as I would be with her.\n\nToday is also a goddamn fucking disgrace.\n\nPerhaps, in time, #NationalWalkoutDay will be remembered as a prominent act in a series of acts that forced America to reconsider and change its relationship with guns. But right now, today, all I can think about is how these kids should have been in school. And how the schools they\u2019re in should be safe. But they were not in school because the schools aren\u2019t as safe as they should be. And the schools are not as safe as they should be because America considers its freedom-wrapped fears more important than the well-being of these young people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd because of this, American schoolchildren can now place themselves on the ever expanding list of people forced to live in and clean up the messes white American men continue to make. A list that, of course, includes black people, all women, Mexicans and too many other groups to name.\n\nAs a dad, I can\u2019t wait for my daughter to continue to surprise me.

Blige\u2019s glow up this awards season; in fact, we\u2019re not sure we\u2019ve stanned this hard for her since What\u2019s the 411? The singer and actress has been nominated for Golden Globe, Critics Choice and Screen Actors Guild awards, and now a history-making two Oscar nods for both her performance and original song in Dee Rees\u2019 Mudbound. And she has stunned us on every single red carpet.\n\nBut those stunning looks have a secret weapon in a longtime member of Blige\u2019s team: celebrity makeup artist D\u2019Andre Michael. Knowing how much we wanted the 411 on Blige\u2019s super-fly SAG Awards look, Michael let The Glow Up in on a surprisingly low-priced secret: He exclusively used products from Black Opal.\n\nYes, THAT Black Opal (its Instagram is kind of poppin\u2019, by the way). In Michael\u2019s words:\n\nI\u2019ve been working with Mary J. Blige for years, and I love trying new looks on her. I wanted to create a showstopping look using Black Opal for her first-time appearance at the SAG Awards. Once I saw her gown, I knew I wanted to transform her into an elegant smoked goddess.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe was smokin\u2019 indeed, styled by fashion fave Law Roach in a one-shouldered black-and-white gown with a dramatic wing motif by designer Jean-Louis Sabaji.\n\nMichael, who\u2019s been on Blige\u2019s team for over a decade, complemented her dress and sleek modern hairstyle with a perfect smoky eye atop glowing skin, using Black Opal all the way. He shared with The Glow Up why, after years of working with the superstar, this awards season is such a special one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up: As a longtime member of Mary J. Blige\u2019s team, what\u2019s it like to work with her during this groundbreaking phase of her career?\n\nD\u2019Andre Michael: Having been with Mary J. Blige now for 11 years, we are more like family. I am so proud and honored to be a part of this moment with her. I\u2019m happy and overjoyed with her continued success, but this is like the stepping-stone to something I know she has been passionate [about]. It\u2019s amazing to see the acknowledgment and praise she is receiving for her work as an actress. I\u2019m like a proud brother.\n\nTGU: Mary\u2019s looks have been phenomenal at every event. How are you able to keep her looks so fresh?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDM: I have been with her every step of the way: Every award show, every red carpet, press junket, television show, etc. It\u2019s always been my thing to make her look good every time.\n\nMaybe because she\u2019s on a different platform now, a broader audience is taking note, but nothing has changed much with what we do. It\u2019s being there as a support for her in all that she\u2019s going through personally, making sure her spirits are up and she feels good about herself and comfortable with how she looks, what she\u2019s wearing, etc. So I think what shines through mostly is her \u201chappy\u201d\u2014and when you feel good internally, it shows externally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: You used exclusively Black Opal for Mary\u2019s SAG Awards look. Tell us why we should be checking for drugstore brands, and why Black Opal works so well for our tones?\n\nDM: I have never been one to follow trends or fads, mainly because trends come and go, and fads fade away. However, staying true to myself as an artist and finding things that work for me to use on my clients is most important. That\u2019s above any brand\u2014whether it is department store, drugstore or specialty store.\n\nI have learned just because something has a name brand on it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s suitable for what I need to use it for. Therefore, it is all about the quality of a product, and sometimes the most expensive product isn\u2019t necessarily the best. A lot of my favorite go-to products are drugstore brands.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy friend Sam Fine worked with Black Opal years ago and helped them with their colors and palettes. Even then, I realized It was a brand that I could trust, because he\u2019s an amazing artist that I respect and call a friend. So if Sam trusts them, I know I can.\n\nDM: Black Opal has always been a staple for having a great color range for women of color; from the fairest of women to the darkest, you could trust you are in good hands with the Black Opal brand, and the formula is great. It gives great coverage that you could work with, whether you need a light coverage to a complete coverage. The Black Opal True Color Skin Perfecting Stick Foundation is amazing! It is great to see they are still around and providing women of color and us professionals with great colors and a great formula.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: At 47, Mary looks incredible. Can you talk about how makeup differs for women in her age group?\n\nDM: The only difference is probably the fads and trends you may want to stay away from with a more mature woman. In terms of looks, you definitely want to use less powder and more products that enhance a dewier look.\n\nFor eyes, most to all women can carry a smoky eye. Many think \u201csmoky eye,\u201d and they think black or dark. But you can smoke your eyes with almost any color.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn terms of skin, I like to do my concealer, then apply my foundation, next set with a powder, and maybe spritz your face with a mister or the Evian mist spray to infuse the powder and foundation. Next, let it air-dry to take away the powdered look so you have more of a dewy skin appearance.\n\nIlluminators work as well, but know that sometimes these can come across drab and chalky looking if you use the wrong color. For women of color, I recommend an illuminator in the flesh-tone range (bronzy or mauve, etc.), and stay away from pearl color or yellows or orange-based colors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, even after all that great advice, we couldn\u2019t let Michael go without getting his step-by-step for creating Blige\u2019s SAG look, and all the products he used. How else are we going to plan for our next shopping trip?\n\nFor the Face\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the Eyes\n\nTo sculpt and define Blige\u2019s eyes, Michael used the Black Opal Aurora Eyeshadow Palette. First, he used the Brazen Copper shade on her entire eyelid. Next, he added Brazen Bronze on her crease, adding the Bordeaux Beige shade along the brow bone as a highlight.\n\n\n\nMichael then finished the eye look with Black Opal Color Splurge Automatic Eye Lining Pencil in Licorice, adding it along the lash line and inner lid and smudging to create a smoky look. Note: This eye pencil is formulated with aloe vera and chamomile extracts that help to soothe the delicate eye area as you define it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Lasting Lip\n\nFor the finishing touches to Blige\u2019s look, Michael used Black Opal Lip Color Splurge Stick Lip in Purr, a soft, pale-pink color enriched with emollient butters and vitamins C&E. This lipstick provides a bright, pigment-rich color that provides a smooth, creamy, nondrying finish.\n\nNo word yet on what Blige\u2019s look will be for the 90th Academy Awards on March 4. But even after Michael works his magic, we know the finishing touch will really be Mary J. Blige\u2019s happiness. The Glow Up gang will be watching on our live Facebook group thread and rooting for her\u2014and everybody black!", "keywords": ["bliges", "price", "limit", "great", "eye", "black", "looks", "js", "love", "color", "look", "opal", "mary", "michael", "awards", "sag"], "polarity": 0.24930036777381906, "subjectivity": 0.5446655237584439},

Those answers also reflected anxiety about the administration,\u201d Tara Bahrampour reported Tuesday in the Washington Post.\n\n\u201cIt is striking that this new poll finds such large shares of black Americans saying it is a bad time to be a black man or woman in the U.S. today, while our earlier polls found much larger shares saying it was a good time to belong to one of these groups,\u201d said Liz Hamel, director of public opinion and survey research at the Kaiser Family Foundation, Bahrampour reported.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, a new poll released Monday by Latino Victory Project, Latino Decisions and America\u2019s Voice found that \u201can overwhelming majority of Latinos \u2014 76 percent \u2014 disapprove of President Donald Trump\u2019s performance and 7 out [of] 10 believe the Republican Party doesn\u2019t care about or is hostile toward Latinos.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, for the first time in polling Latinos, racism and race relations rated as one of the most important issues facing our country,\u201d Latino Decisions reported.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThough Latinos may have had low expectations of Trump given he launched his campaign by saying Mexico sends rapists and criminals to the U.S, the poll found that 59 percent of the respondents think Trump is doing even worse than they expected,\u201d Stephen A. Nu\u00f1o wrote Monday for NBC Latino.\n\nThe PerryUndem poll found African Americans looking back to the Obama administration for trustworthy voices. Asked, \u201cdo you personally trust any of these people or groups to work on issues important to you?\u201d the highest ratings went to former first lady Michelle Obama, former president Barack Obama, the NAACP, Black Lives Matter and the YMCA/YWCA.\n\nWhile black voters are the racial demographic group with the strongest disapproval of Trump, they are by no means alone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere are deep party, gender and racial divisions on whether President Trump is fit to serve,\u201d the Quinnipiac University Poll found.\n\n\u201cTrump is not fit, Democrats say 94 - 5 percent and independent voters say 57 - 40 percent. Republicans say 84 - 14 percent that he is fit.\n\n\u201cMen are divided 49 - 49 percent, as women say 63 - 35 percent he is not fit.\n\n\u201cWhite voters are divided as 50 percent say he is fit and 48 percent say he is not fit. Trump is not fit, black voters say 94 - 4 percent and Hispanic voters say 60 - 40 percent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAmerican voters disapprove 62 - 32 percent of the way President Trump is handling race relations. Disapproval is 55 - 39 percent among white voters, 95 - 3 percent among black voters and 66 - 28 percent among Hispanic voters.

Newspaper editorials helped push it there.\n\n\u201cReporting from Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria has been one of the toughest assignments for journalists, as the island is grappling with damaged infrastructure, limited commercial flights and spotty electricity and cell service,\u201d Hadas Gold reported Wednesday for CNNMoney. \u201cAnd yet, nearly every major American English and Spanish-language broadcast, cable network and national newspaper [has] correspondents on the ground.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe networks have not necessarily deployed their big name anchors as they did for Hurricanes Harvey and Irma and the storm and its aftermath [are] not attracting the same wall-to-wall coverage. Nonetheless, intrepid journalists are still getting to the story, and sometimes become the first outsiders to reach remote areas on the island.\n\n\u201cSome reporters were in place before the hurricane hit last Wednesday. But many more have just started arriving in the past few days on the few commercial flights available, or tagging along with rescue missions and military transports. Reporters on the island are resorting to filing stories using satellite phones by dictation, relying on the few places with generators, whatever cell service and WiFi they can find (especially in the capital San Juan) and other broadcasting services like LiveU and FlyAway to get their stories online and on air.\n\n\u201c \u2018Most of the team is staying at hotels without electricity and water. They have relied on the local station for water and power. Needless to say, gas, food and cash are hard to get,\u2019 said Telemundo spokesperson Camilo Pino.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSpanish language networks have gone all in on the coverage to cater to their Spanish-speaking viewers, many of whom may have family ties with those on the island. Telemundo sent three correspondents and one host, in addition to dozens of producers, cameramen and fixers who are working closely with the local affiliate, Pino said.\n\n\u201cUnivision has 35 people on the ground and a remote FlyAway studio for transmission, a network spokesperson said. . . .\u201d\n\nJarvis DeBerry, NOLA.com | Times-Picayune: Donald Trump\u2019s too busy tweeting to express concern for Puerto Rico\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEditorial, Chicago Sun-Times: Ignore the dumber Trump tweets and rescue Puerto Rico\n\nEditorial, Miami Herald: Puerto Rico needs more U.S. assistance \u2014 now\n\nEditorial, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette: Citizens in crisis: The devastation in Puerto Rico cries for response\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEditorial, St. Louis Post-Dispatch: Hurricane-ravaged U.S. Caribbean territories require urgent help\n\nTom Embury-Dennis, the Independent, London: Donald Trump accused of \u2018owing\u2019 Puerto Rico $33m after golf club bankruptcy\n\nSeth Fiegerman, CNNMoney: Trump\u2019s FCC criticized for hurricane response\n\nJuan Gonz\u00e1lez and Amy Goodman with Nelson Denis, Democracy Now!: Profits vs. Puerto Rican Lives: Trump Admin Blocks Aid from Reaching Devastated Island\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDana Milbank, Washington Post: The sad suspicion about Trump\u2019s shameful treatment of Puerto Rico\n\nMary Mitchell, Chicago Sun-Times: Hurricane Maria is Trump\u2019s Hurricane Katrina\n\nAndr\u00e9s Oppenheimer, Miami Herald: Trump\u2019s response to Puerto Rico\u2019s Hurricane Maria: slow, unenthusiastic and mean\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmy Davidson Sorkin, New Yorker: The Distance Between Donald Trump and Puerto Rico\n\nHelen Ubi\u00f1as, Philadelphia Daily News: New Jersey mom frantic to reach loved ones in Puerto Rico\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLauren Williams Named Editor-in-Chief at Vox.com\n\nLauren Williams, a veteran of TheRoot.com, Mother Jones and AOL Black Voices, has been named editor-in-chief of vox.com, where she was executive editor, co-founder Ezra Klein, the previous editor-in-chief, announced on Tuesday.\n\n\n\nThe promotion stands in contrast with the start-up\u2019s image when it launched in 2014, when it was a lightning rod for complaints that Internet startups were devoid of racial diversity.\u201d Effective immediately, Lauren Williams will be Vox\u2019s new editor-in-chief.

I didn\u2019t cry because Skipper was mean or rude to me. I cried because I felt I had let him and my colleagues down.\n\n\u201cSince my tweets criticizing President Donald Trump exploded into a national story, the most difficult part for me has been watching ESPN become a punching bag and seeing a dumb narrative kept alive about the company\u2019s political leanings. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHill also wrote, \u201cStill, Twitter wasn\u2019t the place to vent my frustrations because, fair or not, people can\u2019t or won\u2019t separate who I am on Twitter from the person who co-hosts the 6 p.m. SportsCenter. Twitter also isn\u2019t a great place to have nuanced, complicated discussions, especially when it involves race. Warriors player Kevin Durant and I probably need to take some classes about how to exercise better self-control on Twitter. Lesson learned.\n\n\u201cAlso, let me be clear about something else: My criticisms of the president were never about politics. In my eyes, they were about right and wrong. I love this country.

Other players, such as 49ers teammate Eric Reid, Philadelphia Eagles safety Malcolm Jenkins, Denver Broncos linebacker Brandon Marshall and Miami Dolphins receiver Kenny Stills, joined him in either kneeling or raising a fist during the anthem.\n\n\u201cNow some of those players are concerned that Trump\u2019s comments, including those made on Wednesday when he said the NFL business would \u2018go to hell\u2019 if the league didn\u2019t change its rules regarding protests during the anthem, have obscured the meaning of the protests.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c \u2018We can\u2019t get lost in what Trump\u2019s said,\u2019 Marshall told USA TODAY Sports on Wednesday. \u2018We have to try to change the narrative back to what the original message was about.\u2019\n\n\u201cOthers agree. . . .\u201d\n\nBecket Adams, Washington Examiner: Journalism magazine says it\u2019s time to label Trump\u2019s words \u2018racist.\u2019 Good.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlejandro Danois, Shadow League: A White Player\u2019s NFL Guide To Taking A Knee During The National Anthem\n\nEditorial, Daily News, New York: Trump\u2019s personal foul against the NFL and America\n\nEditorial, Dallas Morning News: Trump\u2019s NFL comments served only to coddle the ugliest elements of his base\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEditorial, Miami Herald: In America, we all get to say what we think\n\nRen\u00e9e Graham, Boston Globe: Why aren\u2019t we talking about racism?\n\nIndira A.R.

He will also oversee the editorial direction of the ESPN app.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBoth King and Williamson will continue to report to ESPN content chief Connor Schell. . . .\u201d\n\nFirst-Time TV Directors of Color Double\n\n\u201cThe pipeline of new episodic television directors grew larger than ever before and became markedly more inclusive in the 2016/17 television season \u2014 with the percentage of ethnic minority first-time TV directors more than doubling since 2009/10 and the percentage of women nearly tripling \u2014 according to a report published today by the Directors Guild of America,\u201d the guild reported Wednesday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c \u2018Finally, after years of our efforts to educate the industry, hold employers accountable through our contracts, and push them to do better, we\u2019re seeing signs of meaningful improvement,\u2019 said DGA President Thomas Schlamme.\n\n\u201cThe move toward inclusion \u2014 after years of glacial progress \u2014 suggests that qualified people who have previously been overlooked because of their race or gender are beginning to get recognition and opportunities commensurate with their talent. . . .\u201d\n\nLynn Elber added for the Associated Press, \u201cThe expanding world of TV has brought more opportunity overall, with streaming services such as Netflix and Hulu joining broadcast and cable platforms to push the combined number of TV series to 400-plus and counting. An all-time high of 225 first-time directors were hired last season by studios, networks and executive producers, a 42 percent increase over the previous season, the study found. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlacks Less Likely to Find Relief From Bankruptcy\n\n\u201cBlack people struggling with debts are far less likely than their white peers to gain lasting relief from bankruptcy, according to a ProPublica analysis,\u201d a ProPublica headline said Wednesday in introducing a report by Paul Kiel with Hannah Fresques, co-published with the Atlantic. \u201cPrimarily to blame is a style of bankruptcy practiced by lawyers in the South.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a piece accompanying \u201cToo Broke for Bankruptcy,\u201d Kiel and Fresques wrote, \u201cIn this analysis, using a national dataset of bankruptcy filings, we document the scope of racial disparities in bankruptcy filings and outcomes. These disparities are large, pervasive and remain even when considering a host of factors, including income, assets, and the court districts where debtors lived.\n\n\n\n\u201cSpecifically, we found that for people residing in majority black zip codes who file for bankruptcy, the odds of having their cases dismissed (and failing to attain lasting relief) were more than twice as high as those of debtors living in mostly white zip codes.\n\n\u201cThe main driver of this disparity is chapter choice. Black people struggling with debts are choosing to file under Chapter 13, as opposed to Chapter 7, at much higher rates. Unlike Chapter 7, which in almost all cases provides permanent debt relief within a matter of months, Chapter 13 is a particularly risky choice for these debtors, because Chapter 13 usually requires five years of payments before any debt is wiped out, and black Americans are much less likely to have the resources to run this gauntlet. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJared Kushner\u2019s Md. Tenants File Class Action Suit\n\n\u201cBaltimore-area tenants of the apartment company owned by Jared Kushner, son-in-law and adviser to President Donald J. Trump, filed a lawsuit Wednesday alleging the firm has been charging improper fees and threatening eviction to force payment,\u201d Doug Donovan reported Wednesday for the Baltimore Sun.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe two tenants who filed the lawsuit in Baltimore Circuit Court Wednesday morning are Tenae Smith, who lives in the Dutch Village apartments in Northeast Baltimore, and Howard Smith, who lives in the Carroll Park apartments in Middle River.\n\n\u201cThe tenants are asking the court to certify the lawsuit as a class action on behalf of all tenants living in the 17 apartment complexes in Maryland owned by the Kushner Cos. and managed by its affiliate, Westminster Management.\n\n\u201cWestminster Management manages nearly 8,800 units in Maryland. . . .\u201d\n\nIn May, ProPublica\u2019s Alec MacGillis reported that Kushner quietly bought-up thousands of modest and run-down apartment units in Essex and other Baltimore suburbs, whose tenants complain of poor maintenance, harsh rent collection techniques, and relentless pursuit of old and sometimes dubious debts generated after tenants moved out.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy email, MacGillis then gave Journal-isms his \u201crough sense\u201d of the racial breakdown of the affected tenants:\u201cFour of the 15 complexes are virtually all black.\u201c9 or 10 of them are mixed white and black, in varying degrees. Most of those are probably still majority black.\u201c1 or 2 have quite a few Hispanic residents mixed in as well.\u201d\n\nMacron, at U.N., Backs Journalist Protections\n\n\u201cIn his first address to the United Nations General Assembly\u201d on Sept. 19, \u201cFrench President Emmanuel Macron backed a call by Reporters Without Borders (RSF) and a coalition of more than 130 NGOs and media outlets for the creation of a concrete mechanism to enforce international law regarding the protection of journalists,\u201d the press freedom group reported.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cRSF has been calling for the creation of this mechanism for the past two years as part of the #ProtectJournalists campaign.\n\n\u201cAfter defending press freedom in his address, President Macron said: \u2018I call for the appointment of a special representative of the United Nations secretary-general for the protection of journalists throughout the world, because the fight against terrorism and the harsher world we are living in should under no circumstances justify any reduction in this freedom.\u2019 . . .\u201d\n\nReporters Without Borders also wrote, \u201cAt least 780 journalists and media workers have been killed in connection with their work in the past ten years, despite strong resolutions adopted by the UN Security Council, General Assembly, and Human Rights Council. No fewer than 78 journalists were killed worldwide in 2016 alone. At least 35 journalists and media workers have been killed since the start of 2017. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupport Journal-isms Go Fund Me page\n\nJoin the list of supporters.\n\nRichard Prince\u2019s Journal-isms originates from Washington.

In the process, she has interviewed witnesses, pundits and firsthand participants, acting as both cultural anthropologist and, later, griot in retelling the tales.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDeavere Smith\u2019s first foray into \u201cdocumentary theater\u201d was 1992\u2019s Fires in the Mirror, a critically acclaimed one-woman show of 29 monologues, gleaned from interviews of activists, participants and spectators of the 1991 Crown Heights riots in Brooklyn, N.Y. The riots were sparked by the accidental vehicular homicide of a young black child by an Orthodox Jewish man. During the riots, a visiting Australian Orthodox man was stabbed and killed in retaliation.\n\nThat groundbreaking piece of work\u2014in which Deavere Smith performed each of the 29 people she\u2019d interviewed\u2014was followed by 1994\u2019s Tony-nominated Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992, in which Deavere Smith re-enacted interviews she\u2019d recorded of people in relation to the Los Angeles riots, including Rep. Maxine Waters, opera singer Jessye Norman and riot victim Reginald Denny.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow the groundbreaking playwright and actress has turned her gaze to the school-to-prison pipeline with Notes From the Field, a study of the epidemic of mass incarceration and villainization of black children in America. As Deavere Smith told The Glow Up, it\u2019s an issue that was initially brought to her attention by Ann Beeson, then head of George Soros\u2019 Open Society:\n\nShe said come over, and I want you to learn about it. So I went over to the foundation, where about 15 people from around the country together were doing work on the school-to-prison pipeline, and I heard story after story. And the story that changed my life for the next six years was a story about a kid in Baltimore who had peed in a watercooler, and they were going to take him to jail. Well, now, if somebody told me that now, I would go, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s what would happen.\u201d But at the time, I was flabbergasted. And it was like, \u201cMan, this has to be my coming-home project because I grew up Baltimore;\u201d my mother was a teacher, and her sisters were teachers, all my father\u2019s sisters were teachers. I grew up around teachers, and they change lives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the time, Deavere Smith was appearing on Showtime\u2019s Nurse Jackie and recalled recounting the watercooler incident in a casual conversation with British co-star Emily Best:\n\nAnd I said [to Best], \u201cYou know, I can\u2019t believe what I just heard. I heard about this kid who peed in a watercooler, and they were going to take him to jail.\u201d And [Best] said in that fantastic, Oxford-trained, British accent, she said, \u201cOh well, whatever happened to mischief?\u201d And it was just, \u201cMan ... rich kids get mischief; poor kids go to jail and get pathologized.\u201d And I was in it from that minute on.\n\nDeavere Smith hails from a family of female educators\u2014including her own mother, an elementary school principal who expected her award-winning eldest daughter to follow in her academic footsteps. Instead, Deavere Smith became both an actress and cultural anthropologist of sorts, interviewing people at the intersection of pivotal moments in contemporary American history. In the process, she became an educator after all, teaching at both New York University and Stanford.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut current events still serve as her inspiration, drawing her back to the stage at another pivotal moment in American race relations. It was while staying on Native American reservations, studying the abject poverty of our indigenous people, that Deavere Smith said she got the inspiration for Notes From the Field:\n\nYou know, I was just going to do sort of town halls in the areas where I did interviews, and I just would do staged readings. And then Michael Brown was shot in 2014, and I thought, \u201cWell, here\u2019s one of those rare moments that America is paying attention to race, and I need to fix it into a real play and get myself on stage and get out there.\u201d So, that\u2019s what I ended up doing. ... And as an African American, I\u2019m coming from a history of struggle. And so, the only thing I can possibly do about that\u2014and I don\u2019t know the hymn\u2014is to carry \u201cthe bloodstained banner\u201d of struggle. And so, I think that is a very exciting thing to do. And that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been doing with my adult life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd what is it like to bear witness to some of the most painful moments in people\u2019s lives\u2014moments that are potentially pivotal in how we discuss race in America? Those tensions and traumas are exactly the moments Deavere Smith is most interested in:\n\nWell , number one, you know, I like catastrophe because I\u2019m a dramatist. And most plays\u2014serious plays\u2014are tackling some kind of problem ... and the writer, through the characters, is trying to make it right. And while they\u2019re trying to make it right, they go through a kind of a storm, and I\u2019m very interested in that storm ... So I\u2019m interested in what it takes to go through the storm, and if I can suggest anything at the end of that storm by putting myself through the pseudo storm, that is by embodying the people who tell me the story\u2014and particularly the people who are most caught up in it. And you know, my whole experiment on the research of American character is about the power of language. And so, when I sit with someone, I\u2019m waiting for them to tell me of the catastrophe from their point of view, and while I\u2019m with them, I watch them make sense of it. And that\u2019s a very gratifying experience.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDeavere Smith\u2019s process is one of observation and recording, followed by extensive hours of study on rarely more than five minutes of monologue from the person she\u2019s studying. She then rehearses with a dialect coach and a former Alvin Ailey dancer to re-enact the cadence and movement as accurately as possible. As she told The Glow Up, she considers the process a loving one:\n\nI think that the kind of attention we pay to the people that are going to become what I call \u201cportraits\u201d in my work is a form of love. And I don\u2019t know if the people trust me. I think if I\u2019ve done well, if I\u2019ve succeeded at paying as much attention as I ought to, then what the audience is really observing is me loving those people.\n\nBut even as Deavere Smith\u2019s lens is currently focused on the school-to-prison pipeline, she is quick to point out that even those conversations are limited in their scope. She notes that even while identifying the inequities that create the crisis, one crucial aspect tends to be ignored:\n\nIn the school-to-prison pipeline, most of what you are going to [find]\u2014if you research it\u2014is about boys. ... I didn\u2019t have to look very far to watch and see the ways in which girls and women are intersected by this system in different ways than boys. What was interesting to me ... there\u2019s a girl in Texas [Dajerria Becton] who [was] thrown around in her bathing suit by a cop. It\u2019s, like, unbelievable ... we watched that over and over again. Before that cop throws her on the ground, she\u2019s with her friends, who are indignant about the cop\u2019s behavior\u2014very strong, you know, sassy 14-year-olds, confident, standing there in their bathing suits. And he walks over to them and he says, \u201cY\u2019all better stop running your mouths.\u201d Cut to when \u201cShakara\u201d gets thrown across the room in South Carolina, young Niya Kenny gets taken to jail for getting up and saying, \u201cAin\u2019t anybody to do anything about this?\u201d while her classmates are still looking in their computers. And she says, \u201cWhat the fuck? What the fuck?\u201d And she\u2019s taken off to jail. And so, I think, there is this way\u2014and you know, Angela Davis, every photograph of her, her mouth is open. There is this way that we as black women aren\u2019t supposed to run our mouths.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Notes From the Field, the last person portrayed is activist and filmmaker Bree Newsome, whom Deavere Smith interviewed after Newsome climbed a flagpole in 2015, risking her life to remove the Confederate flag from the South Carolina Statehouse grounds. For Deavere Smith, Newsome is an example of the way that hope can consistently inspire heroism:\n\nYou know, personally, it is an amazing experience to be able to go through these catastrophes. And they are not depressing, and it is not hopeless. It is hopeful. I know I can quote Cornel West for you, and you will understand that when he differentiated between hope and optimism, he says, you know optimism looks at the evidence and says, \u201cOh, things are gonna be better.\u201d But hope looks at the evidence and says, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look good, it doesn\u2019t look good at all.\u201d But I\u2019m going to make a leap of faith, go beyond the evidence to try to create new possibilities based on visions that become contagious and allow people to engage in heroic actions, always against the odds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up tip: Notes From the Field premieres on HBO Saturday, Feb. 24, at 8 p.m. EST.", "keywords": ["im", "americas", "dramas", "going", "jail", "notes", "smith", "deavere", "biggest", "know", "storm", "moments", "american", "taking", "racial", "field", "anna"], "polarity": 0.17359655880842317, "subjectivity": 0.44786759850319185},

Aside from being one of the longest-running fashion magazines around (79 years and counting, to be exact), it\u2019s also one of the more inclusive, featuring women of various colors, sizes and ages long before its competitors caught on.\n\n\n\nMatter of fact, we were pleased to see that its judging committee featured several of our faves on the beauty and style scene, including Felicia Walker Benson, Lacy Redway, Patrice Grell Yursik and Sai de Silva. We were equally thrilled to see a few of our favorite products validated by Glamour\u2019s list, which covered both designer and drugstore finds in skin care, hair care, and makeup\u2014even organic offerings.\n\nAnd because we love a bargain, let\u2019s start where we get the most bang for our buck: at the drugstore. While we love a good designer splurge, there are some low-cost products folks are simply sleeping on, and these are the ones both Glamour and The Glow Up agreed on:\n\nSimple Water Boost Micellar Water, $9: You want to get super clean in a few swipes? This is the product. Micellar water made big waves in 2017, but Simple\u2019s ... simple formula is among our favorites for all types of skin, containing no fragrances, color or harsh chemicals.\n\n\n\nOlay Eyes Deep Hydrating Eye Gel, $30: This pick may seem equally old-school and expensive for the drugstore, but for tired eyes (am I the only one who has those? should it be called \u201ceditor\u2019s eyes\u201d?), this is an instant fix, and just a dab will do ya. Trust, it\u2019s worth it.\n\nDove Invisible Dry Spray Antiperspirant, $5: Yeah, yeah, we know ... Dove messed up big time in 2017. But we\u2019re not ones to throw out the baby with the bath wash, so to speak, and the good this brand has done and continues to do\u2014including inclusive advertising, hiring and ongoing self-esteem workshops for underprivileged black and brown girls\u2014should not be overshadowed by an admittedly really stupid mistake.\n\nThat said, their Invisible Dry Spray is one of the best antiperspirants around, and literally keeps us looking (and smelling) clean in our white tees ... and black tees ... and red tees ...\n\nThat said, their Invisible Dry Spray is one of the best antiperspirants around, and literally keeps us looking (and smelling) clean in our white tees ... and black tees ... and red tees ... L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris Brow Stylist Definer, $9: So yeah, this is my daily go-to for my brows, which never quite grew in any glamorous fashion even before I plucked them into En Vogue-level submission in my high school and college years. Aside from the brush at one end, the dense angled retractable product at the other is never too red, too gray, too waxy, or too creamy. It goes on realistically, and stays all day. Enough said.\n\nCoverGirl LashBlast Volume, $9: LashBlast has eclipsed GreatLash as our go-to drugstore brand, and for good reason: Every variation in this line gives us the big, lush lashes we\u2019ve been looking for (or at least, me, who has absolutely anemic lashes). Two non-clumpy coats, and we\u2019re good to go!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnto the organics. As much as we hate the price point, one product line Glamour really got right was Tata Harper, who started her skin care in her own garden. This is a bite-the-bullet purchase, but I\u2019ve personally been known to hoard samples to give myself mini facials on the road.\n\nTata Harper Clarifying Moisturizer, $105: Damn it, I wish this stuff wasn\u2019t so good, but for my now confused, middle-aged, \u201cI want to dry up and break out\u201d skin, this stuff has worked wonders. Sorry, not sorry.\n\nTata Harper Clarifying Mask, $68: Also, and as well.\n\nFor curly and textured hair (first of all, can we give Glamour big ups for realizing this deserved its own category?) there were a couple of picks that hit the high and low of our budgets, but did equally amazing things for our curls:\n\nAlterna Caviar Infinite Color Hold Shampoo & Conditioner, $34 each: Yep, not cheap, but great\u2014especially for aging or overworked hair. Somehow, this miracle potion tricks my follicles into believing they\u2019re at least a decade younger. And who doesn\u2019t want that?\n\nDark and Lovely Au Naturale Anti-Shrinkage Clumping Curl Clay Cleanser, $10: Look, shrinkage is a real issue, people (take that however you want to take it), and we\u2019re grateful that someone on Dark and Lovely\u2019s chemistry team saw this problem and sought to solve it. This product truly puts the coils in curls, and gives definition where frizz wants to flourish. We\u2019re here for it.\n\nDove Refresh+Care Unscented Dry Shampoo, $4: Yep, Dove came so nice, they made it twice, and we promise you, if you\u2019re don\u2019t already, dry shampoo is the one product you should include in your arsenal. Workout hair? Dry shampoo. Need volume at the roots? Dry shampoo. Too much product weighing you down? Dry shampoo. And for $4, can you really afford not to experiment a bit?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor makeup, we only found two that found us completely in agreement with Glamour, at both ends of our price range:\n\nGiorgio Armani Power Fabric Foundation, $64: Nope, there are aren\u2019t 40 shades, there are 20. But this range was formulated by a black woman, makeup genius Pat McGrath, and eight of those 20 shades are definitively for brown-skinned girls\u2014even those with very deep hues (McGrath herself is a healthy chocolate). But the finish? Absolutely sublime. This is truly fashion for your face.\n\nMaybelline New York Fit Me! Matte + Poreless, $8: But if you want 40 shades at one eighth of the price, this should be your jam. Simple, silky, and easily accessible, this foundation is perfect for every day, and gets oil immediately under control. And there truly is a shade for everybody.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, there you have it: the faves that The Glow Up and Glamour agree should be in your beauty arsenal. That said, trust that we have a few faves of our own, so stay tuned for The Glow Up Beauty Awards later this year.

Since 2011, The Root has proudly honored the best and brightest African Americans between the ages of 15 and 22, the brilliant and inspirational leaders who are already charting their own paths in the worlds of business, science and tech, the arts, social justice and the environment. At a time when there is a void in leadership in Washington, D.C., and beyond, these Young Futurists are stepping up to show the world that, regardless of their age, they are ready and willing to lead the way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmong this year\u2019s honorees: photographers Myles Loftin and Quil Lemons, who are using their creativity to rewrite the prevailing narrative around masculinity and black boys, who are often tossed aside by a society that labels them thugs and criminals.\n\n\n\nThere is Essynce Moore, who at 15 years old, has already written three books (that are required reading in several school districts), launched a fashion and beauty line, opened a spa and spoken to thousands around the country. It bears repeating that she is only 15.\n\n\n\nGeorge Hofstetter is using technology to help black children avoid brutal confrontations with the police, with his app CopStop. The app allows users to record their interactions with police\u2014providing a different perspective than that of police bodycams or a recording when there are no bodycams at all\u2014as well as teaches young people how to interact with police.\n\n\n\nAt 9 years old, Zandra Cunningham started her own natural skin-care line called Zandra Beauty.

Thankfully, one of her earliest instructors quickly realized that and told her she should try speedskating.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the time, Maame had just moved to the United States from Accra, Ghana, to live with her dad, Kweku. Then, in January 2017, she won a bronze medal in the 500-meter short-track race at the World Junior Championships in Austria. Fast-forward to just three months ago, and Maame made history by becoming the first black woman to qualify for a U.S. Olympic speedskating team. And she\u2019s only 18 years old.\n\n\u201cBeing the first African-American girl on this Olympic team is really awesome because then that means that young African-American girls\u2014or any race for that matter\u2014could go out there, find an ice rink, and just skate and try it out because you never know, you could be the next Olympian, which is an awesome thing to be,\u201d she told CNN.\n\nWith a smile that lights up a room and a belly-aching laugh that is filled with joy, Maame quickly became a fan fave to watch at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. She competed in the 500-meter and the 1,500-meter races. Maame finished fourth in the quarterfinals for the 500-meter race, and last place in her 1,500-meter heat.

The 20-year-old photographer started a photo series in 2016 called Glitterboy, inspired by Frank Ocean\u2019s music video for \u201cNikes.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShortly after the video\u2019s release, Quil was at a Milk Makeup launch party and wanted to \u201cshine and shine and shine\u201d just like Ocean, a real glitterboy. After posting a selfie to Instagram, with the caption that \u201creal\u201d men wear makeup, he decided to start a portrait/interview series with black men about masculinity. Every boy or man in the project, whether straight or gay, wears makeup in their shot, in front of a pink background.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important to have a broader lens of the definition of masculinity because no two people are the same,\u201d Quil told The Root. \u201cAnd there is so much beauty in being black; there is so much beauty in being a black man.\u201d\n\nPeople are already taking notice of his work. He ran into SZA in 2017, and she immediately recognized him as Glitterboy. He documented New York City\u2019s Pride Festival for Vogue and will soon begin work with the Conde Nast publication Them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQuil has received mixed reactions from people on social media\u2014and offline\u2014but he knows how important it is to change the narrative around black men and masculinity.\n\n\u201cI remember I was wearing the glitter and a group of older black men saw my face,\u201d he told The Root. \u201cAt first, these men couldn\u2019t make sense of the glitter but immediately said, \u2018Man, I wish I could\u2019ve done something like this when I was your age.\u2019 I think this was the moment I realized that my art has a more substantial voice that is longing to be heard.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis year has already been busy for Quil. He walked New York Fashion Week for ASOS, which made its debut this season, and he also took Polaroid shots of the showcase. Quil also spoke on a panel with legendary Harlem designer Dapper Dan about Afrofuturism and what it means to be a black creative. Quil, who is a student at the New School, is doing more photo shoots in his hometown, Philadelphia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI just want to keep grounding myself in my creativity, just keep elevating my art and perfecting my craft.\u201d\n\nGraphic: GMG, Photo: Gabriel Rivera\n\nMYLES LOFTIN\n\nCategory: Arts and Culture\n\nAge: 19\n\nHometown: Accokeek, Md.\n\nEducation: Parsons School of Design\n\nSocial Media: Twitter, Facebook, Instagram\n\nIt all started with a viral tweet. Myles Loftin was inspired to launch his Hooded photo series after seeing tweets about a simple Google search. Type in \u201cfour black teens\u201d and stereotypical\u2014and damaging\u2014images of black teens pop up; mug shots, wanted posters and teens in police custody dominate the results.\n\nMyles was determined to change the narrative.\n\n\u201cFor as long as the United States has been a country, black men have been painted as savages, criminals,\u201d Myles told the New School. \u201cThese inaccurate depictions trickle down and become ingrained in the minds of the people who see them.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, in 2017, he launched Hooded, a photo and video project that shows black men and boys smiling and hugging each other, in front of bright backgrounds and in hoodies.\n\n\u201cThe video and photographs show black boys who are happy, emotional and positive rather than the traditional stereotype, which paints black males in hoodies as being hardened, intimidating criminals,\u201d he told Vice. \u201cIt\u2019s important that black people, and people of color in general, are accurately represented.\u201d\n\nIn the short film included in the project, he cut together audio from Hillary Clinton\u2019s infamous \u201csuper predator\u201d speech and the 911 call made by George Zimmerman before he fatally shot 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, highlighting the language people too often use to describe young black people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 19-year-old student at Parsons has received widespread acclaim for his work, traveling to the Netherlands to speak about his art and giving a presentation at Yale. Myles has also created several photo projects on his personal website, including Here and Genderqueer, with his frequent collaborator, genderqueer artist Chella Man, and \u201980s Prom Portraits, a series of photos of local artists in Washington, D.C., Maryland and Virginia.\n\n\u201cMe being a successful black photographer is one way of rebellion against the media, which is trying to portray a different image of what black boys are,\u201d he said, the Huffington Post reported.\n\nGraphic: GMG, Photo: Juliet Lubwama\n\nJULIET LUBWAMA\n\nCategory: Arts and Culture\n\nAge: 17\n\nHometown: Downingtown, Pa.\n\nEducation: Downingtown STEM Academy\n\nSocial Media: Instagram\n\nJuliet Lubwama started writing poetry in the fourth grade after reading Maya Angelou\u2019s \u201cPhenomenal Woman.\u201d Fast-forward eight years and the 17-year-old poet has already earned national acclaim.

Her parents are Ugandan immigrants, and she and her siblings were born in the United States. In \u201cTrying to Find Home,\u201d she explores the idea of belonging in these lines: \u201cmy kin arrived with textbooks swaying on their heads/ and shackles round their ankles/ still, in a land we have yet to call home.\u201d In \u201cGood Hair,\u201d Juliet eloquently unpacks the politics of hair with this: \u201cauntie tugs hot comb through hair as if tearing out heritage/ rests my head on her knee at a forty five degree angle/ as she turns unmanageable, imperfect, into adequate.\u201d\n\nAt Downingtown STEM Academy, she gets to explore her second love, neuroscience, and hopes to one day go to medical school. For now, the high school senior plans to host poetry workshops at local hospitals, she told The Root, helping to \u201cintroduce poetry as a form of emotional and mental healing.\u201d More than anything, she hopes she can spread her love for the written word as far as possible, and that other young people are inspired to speak out, too.\n\n\u201cI feel that too often, young people\u2019s voices are diminished and seen as [not valuable],\u201d Juliet told The Root. \u201cHowever, we form our world\u2019s future, and as a result, our voices and messages carry extraordinary weight, whether they be communicated through poetry, public speaking or any other form of the arts.\u201d\n\nGraphic: GMG, Photo: Rebecca Cabage (Invision/AP)\n\nSTORM REID\n\nCategory: Arts and Culture\n\nAge: 15 in July\n\nHometown: Atlanta\n\nSocial Media: Twitter, Facebook, Instagram\n\nThe message that representation matters cannot be overstated. Ava DuVernay\u2019s highly anticipated film A Wrinkle in Time, based on the 1962 fantasy novel by Madeleine L\u2019Engle, is the latest example. The book tells the story of Meg Murry, a teenage girl who travels on an adventure to rescue her father who is stuck in an alternate universe. Of course, the character in the book\u2014and the 2003 TV movie\u2014has always been portrayed as white.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUntil now. Storm Reid, who has appeared in 12 Years a Slave and Sleight, is remarkable in the film, which was released in theaters March 9.

She stars opposite David Oyelowo in the sci-fi thriller Only You in late 2018. In 2017, she appeared in Jay-Z\u2019s celebrity-filled music video for \u201cFamily Feud,\u201d which was also directed by DuVernay.

In 2015, he was named Sports Kid of the Year by Sports Illustrated.\n\nBut Reece, who plans to attend the University of California, Berkeley, in the fall, is also very serious about his education. At the end of his junior year, he was focused on acing Advanced Placement exams and competing at the World Junior Championships.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBoth forced me to stay centered mentally in order to achieve success,\u201d he told The Root. \u201cStaying composed when the pressure is on is typically something that I need work on.\u201d\n\nAnd eyes are definitely on Reece. His name is bubbling up with Olympian swimmers like Simone Manuel, Cullen Jones and Lia Neal. Earlier in February, he broke two national high school records and lowered the national high school record in the 100-meter breaststroke. He\u2019s one of few black swimmers who have reached championship level in recent years. According to the USA Swimming Foundation, 64 percent of black children have low- to no swimming abilities.

His interest in fashion all started with his love of sneakers.\n\n\u201cThroughout high school, I noticed my classmates were always talking about shoes,\u201d Victor told The Root. \u201cIt eventually led me to learn about fashionable streetwear, which I began to purchase and collect. Streetwear and sneakers went hand in hand in my high school years and nothing has changed since.\u201d\n\nWithin a year of the launch of For the Leaux, the site had more than 100,000 visits and thousands of orders. The Houston native also gives back to his community.

For the past several years, she\u2019s been the youth leader and program facilitator for Appetite for Change, a food-justice organization that was co-founded by her mother, La\u2019Tasha. The nonprofit trains community members to learn about fresh foods.\n\n\u201cI want my community to focus their energy into becoming better,\u201d La\u2019Taijah told The Root. \u201cI want us to stop channeling our energy into things that negatively impact us.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith Appetite for Change, she\u2019s been instrumental in getting young people in her community involved with the organization. The group put together a music video, \u201cGrow Food,\u201d which has more than 400,000 views on YouTube.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to make music and use it in a positive way to really get this message out: You could grow your own food,\u201d La\u2019Taijah told the Minneapolis Star Tribune. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to go to a grocery store. Plant your seed and watch it grow.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLa\u2019Taijah helped kick-start the campaign to open Breaking Bread Cafe & Catering, which is not only a sit-down cafe, but it also helps \u201ctrain and employ youth from the community,\u201d according to its website. Most recently, the 21-year-old and other young people involved with Appetite for Change attended the Super Bowl, where the Minneapolis host committee and its legacy fund granted the organization $50,000.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLa\u2019Taijah has no doubt that the work she\u2019s doing with Appetite for Change is helping to change her neighborhood for the better.\n\n\u201cMy community is really important to me, and to see them grow and help them grow is something I\u2019ve always wanted to do,\u201d she told The Star-Tribune.\n\nGraphic: GMG, Photo: Sasha Ariel Alston\n\n\n\n\n\nSASHA ARIEL ALSTON\n\nCategory: Science and Tech\n\nAge: 20\n\nHometown: Washington, D.C.\n\nEducation: Pace University\n\nSocial Media: Twitter, Facebook, Instagram\n\nCall her the \u201cSTEM Queen.\u201d Sasha Ariel Alston first became truly interested in technology during an internship at Microsoft during her senior year of high school.

George, who is a senior at Alameda Community Learning Center, with hopes of going to the University of California at Los Angeles, knows that the work he is doing could have a great impact on marginalized communities.\n\nGeorge has been intrigued by technology for several years. At his first hackathon\u2014when he was 13\u2014he created \u201cConnect the Dots,\u201d a platform to help black students at predominantly white private schools navigate racism on their campuses.

For Ose, that won\u2019t cut it, especially when it comes to educating LGBTQ youth, who are often left out of the sexual-education conversation. Everyone should have access to proper reproductive-rights education\u2014and Ose is ready to keep pressing elected officials to make it happen.\n\n\u201cWhen my conservative, anti-LGBT legislators in Ohio think about their constituency, that includes queer black youth like myself,\u201d they told The Root. \u201cI want them to know that young people like me are watching their actions and are more than ready to vote them out of office and replace them in the years to come.\u201d\n\nOse, who is set to graduate high school this spring, accepted a full-ride scholarship to Ohio State University, where they will study international relations and sexuality studies.

But after reading through some of these notes, \u201cWe\u2019re stopping this book because this guy is advocating sexual assault\u201d could\u2019ve just been an easy alibi for \u201cOMFG THIS DUDE IS AN IDIOT AND HE CAN\u2019T WRITE AND HOW THE FUCK CAN WE GET OUT OF THIS DEAL BEFORE IT\u2019S TOO LATE?\u201d\n\nFrom The Guardian:\n\nThe tone is set in notes on the prologue to the manuscript. Ivers writes to Yiannopoulos: \u201cThroughout the book, your best points seem to be lost in a sea of self-aggrandizement and scattershot thinking,\u201d and adds: \u201cCareful that the egotistical boasting \u2026 doesn\u2019t make you seem juvenile.\u201d \u201cAdd something like this \u2013 only less self-serving\u201d reads another comment early in the manuscript. Ivers frequently calls on Yiannopoulos to back up his assertions in the text. In the first nine pages of chapter one, notes include: \u201cCitations needed\u201d, \u201cDo you have proof of this?\u201d, \u201cUnsupportable charge\u201d and \u201cCite examples\u201d. Yiannopoulos is repeatedly warned his choice of words is undermining any argument he is attempting to make. \u201cThe use of phrases like \u2018two-faced backstabbing bitches\u2019 diminishes your overall point,\u201d reads one comment. \u201cToo important a point to end in a crude quip\u201d is another. \u201cUnclear, unfunny, delete,\u201d reads another. The early sections of a chapter on feminism prompt the note: \u201cDon\u2019t start chapter with accusation that feminists = fat. It destroys any seriousness of purpose.\u201d Yiannopoulos goes on to criticise contemporary feminism as \u201cmerely a capitalist con-job \u2013 a money-grab designed to sell T-shirts to Taylor Swift and Beyonc\u00e9 fans with asinine slogans\u201d. \u201cUm \u2026 like your MILO SWAG?\u201d the editor responds. Ivers\u2019s evident exasperation becomes clear by page 84, where Yiannopoulos\u2019s call for lesbians to be thrown out of academia altogether simply elicits the all-upper-case comment: \u201cDELETE UGH.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBook editing is a hard and deliberate and (occasionally) cruel process for the writer, where words and ideas and themes you\u2019ve poured your entire self into are dissected and prodded and sometimes ripped to shreds. For instance, one of my friends shared with me that her editor asked her to scrap 40,000 words from her 100,000-word-long manuscript and write 40,000 more to replace them.\n\nMost (good) editors are aware of how sensitive this back-and-forth can be, and while they don\u2019t hold back on their criticisms, they do choose language that\u2019s meant to be constructive instead of insulting. So an editor saying something like \u201cDELETE UGH\u201d\u2014which Yiannopoulos\u2019 editor does when addressing his thoughts about feminism\u2014is basically him saying, \u201cFUCK YOU, YO MAMA AND THE HORSE Y\u2019ALL RODE IN ON!\u201d\n\nBut while reading through this was and will continue to be entertaining\u2014my quota for Milo-induced schadenfreude is unlimited\u2014I remembered that Roxane Gay pulled a book from Simon & Schuster because of Yiannopoulos\u2019 deal. She couldn\u2019t, in good conscience, work with a house that would publish a person like him and give him such a generous advance. And then I thought about all of the talented writers I know\u2014particularly people of color\u2014who continue to get passed over while fuckwads like Yiannopoulos get cash thrown at them. And how this dynamic exists in other industries. Shit, in pretty much every industry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a Fast Company piece from May, Bari Williams writes on how black women have to move mountains to get funding while white male inventors get red carpets:\n\nWomen start companies at twice the rate of men, yet women comprise only 16% of tech founders. According to a study by First Round Capital, founding teams including a woman outperform their all-male peers by 63%, but female CEOs get only 2.7% of all venture funding, while women of color get virtually none: 0.2%. The fact that black women are educated and entrepreneurial yet so underfunded is a confluence of broadening thoughts of diversity, use of technology, and economic policy. The Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 increased limits for tax write-offs for startups, such as the ability to deduct cell phone bills and depreciation, and health care costs. This was great news for black women, who tend to be younger when they found their companies, have more debt, and less access to capital. Black women have greater difficulty receiving funding from investors and creditors, and difficulty securing lending due to racial bias. But tax write-offs don\u2019t make up for the funding gap. When black women are funded, they get the short end of the stick, with the average raise round totaling just $36,000. Compare that figure to the composite of the average white male startup founder, who banks an average of $1.3 million in funding. The secondary problem with not receiving mainstream large VC funding? Scaling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen there\u2019s such a discrepancy in support, a self-sustaining loop is created in which white men continue to get the money because investors/publishing houses/networks trust them more than anyone else because white dudes\u2019 successes are more spectacular because white dudes get more chances to be spectacular because white dudes get the money because investors/publishing houses/networks trust them more than anyone else. In Milo Yiannopoulos\u2019 case, this is especially apparent\u2014and especially disheartening\u2014because nothing about him is particularly interesting or compelling. He\u2019s (bleached) blond and gay and a troll and a bigot ... and that\u2019s it. There\u2019s nothing else there. The only there there is a scarf.

Hot on the heels of H&M\u2019s absolutely irresponsible and boycott-inducing use of a black boy to market a sweatshirt proclaiming him the \u201cCoolest Monkey in the Jungle,\u201d Italian beauty brand Wycon Cosmetics decided to up the ante.\n\nThe Milan-based beauty company, which touts over 200,000 Instagram followers, apparently thought it\u2019d be a great idea to name its new line of gel polishes after well-known R&B and hip-hop songs, including \u201cDrop It Like It\u2019s Hot,\u201d \u201cCandy Shop\u201d and \u201cBootylicious.\u201d But the company saved the most provocative for last, with its darkest nail color: a true black named \u201cThick as a Nigga.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYeah. For real, for real.\n\nAccording to writer Declan Eytan for Forbes magazine, the polish name was purportedly inspired by the song \u201cThick Nigga\u201d from artist DBangz\u2014an artist with far less popularity than Wycon, but nevertheless deemed an ideal inspirational choice for the brand.\n\n\n\nOK, sure.\n\nWycon\u2019s indelicate choice understandably\u2014and, likely, expectedly\u2014caused an uproar after a now-deleted Instagram post caught the attention of Afro-Italian entertainer and YouTube personality Loretta Grace, who rightly called out the brand on social media. In response to the torrent of criticism unleashed, the company was at first dismissive, telling one commenter, \u201cThey\u2019re made-up names that are a bit crazy\u201d (ahem, they\u2019re not \u201cmade-up\u201d if you use actual song names). But as outrage mounted, the company offered the type of tepid and tone-deaf response we\u2019ve now become all too accustomed to:\n\nWe\u2019re sorry that this post has triggered these types of reactions: every color from our Gel On collection is inspired, with a cheerful attitude and a pinch of naivety, by famous song titles, many of which derive from the landscape of hip hop . . . Wycon is the brand for everybody #nobodyexcluded is our motto and we didn\u2019t mean to offend anybody!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWycon has since scrubbed all Gel On nail polish names from its website, after undoubtedly getting the attention it wanted\u2014attention we\u2019re admittedly reluctant to add to. But in light of the well-publicized series of similar transgressions by major brands that have preceded this one, we highly doubt that the brand didn\u2019t mean to offend. In fact, we don\u2019t think Wycon cared at all, as evidenced by the response Loretta Grace received from the Italian beauty community, as told to Allure magazine:\n\nMy community was shocked about it . . . But most of the Italian beauty community said that I am exaggerating and that a lot of American rappers and singers like Nicki Minaj and Beyonc\u00e9 say the N* word on their songs so we cannot complain about it. SMDH.\n\nClearly, our shock and awe has become as marketable as our culture (we\u2019d personally love to see the brand get slapped with licensing suits for using those song names). Because in 2018, there is absolutely no excuse for this type of racial insensitivity from a cosmetics brand (or any other), other than a sheer lack of\u2014well, you know. So it\u2019s another day, another insult\u2014and ultimately, we just have one less brand to check for. Because one thing obviously hasn\u2019t hit the Italian beauty market yet, and that\u2019s the importance of the black dollar.

Everything is about to change\u2014or so it seems\u2014as designers present fashion shows featuring clothes generally intended to break the rules. But one thing rarely, if ever, seems to change, and that\u2019s the absence of black designers occupying top spots in the fashion industry.\n\nFreelance designer and journalist Kibwe Chase-Marshall recently published an op-ed in Business of Fashion\u2014one of the most respected media outlets for fashion-industry reporting\u2014titled, \u201cWhy Aren\u2019t There More Black Designers?\u201d It\u2019s a question I\u2019ve asked myself nearly every time I\u2019ve gone into work over my 30-year career in fashion. Why?\n\nAll too often, I\u2019m the only person of color on set doing any job. The rare exception is on the catwalk, where the sheer number of people required to produce a fashion show calls for hiring more than one black person, simply by default. But when the final bow is taken, it is almost never a black designer who has the chance to receive either kudos or a career-ending critique from the press.\n\nChase-Marshall\u2014who worked in high-level but never top-tier jobs, such as vice president or head designer, for firms like Michael Kors, Isaac Mizrahi and Oscar de la Renta\u2014found himself repeatedly slamming up against a glass ceiling. And now he\u2019s breaking that glass ceiling by breaking the silence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Jan. 3, an action-oriented social media campaign, #BreakSilenceBreakCeilings, went live. The campaign was conceived by Chase-Marshall and aimed at breaking the unwritten and unspoken rule of discriminatory hiring practices in fashion, an industry that Chase-Marshall says does not have a \u201cdiversity problem\u201d but, rather, a \u201cblack-people problem.\u201d\n\nHimself a talented technical draftsman, stylist and cutter, Chase-Marshall is not content to simply illustrate the talent of black designers as a solution to the problem. In February, I was on a steering committee for the Black Designers Exhibition and Symposium at the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology, which shed light on the fierce beauty of too-little-seen talent and started the conversation as to why\u2014but did not offer us a plan to advance the battle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChase-Marshall has tailored a solution to fit the problem, noting in his op-ed, \u201cFed up with watching this most blatant form of discrimination thrive, while the broader industry capitalizes on Black celebrity associations and the recent uptick in Black casting, I decided to do something.\u201d\n\nChase-Marshall, who stopped working full time in design studios in 2010 after 13 years, now makes a living as a freelance designer and writer for publications like Elle. He has devised a plan of action for the Council of Fashion Designers of America and Vogue, which collaborate on the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund, the most powerful entity in the American\u2014if not global\u2014luxury-garment industry, which has promoted some of the most successful black designers in recent memory, such as Tracy Reese and Cushnie and Ochs.\n\nChase-Marshall would like to see CFDA/Vogue adopt a program with greater oversight of its design-industry members, such as offering immersive training for hiring managers in elimination of bias, along with CFDA/Vogue\u2019s annual disclosure and endorsement of participating brands, along with annual statistics regarding the racial composition of their design teams.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s what the industry can do, but to consumers who want to take a stand against inequality and appropriation, Chase-Marshall posted:\n\nLet\u2019s do something: If you agree that it\u2019s time for the community of fashion design professionals to be taken to task regarding employment/advancement discrimination against qualified black candidates, along with liking this post, comment #breaksilencebreakceilings and tag @CFDA, @Voguemagazine, @Bof, @nytimes, and @wwd below. In addition, forward this post to 5 friends (or more) that you feel care to affect overdue change.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBlackness, until very recently, was seen as an unmarketable quality,\u201d says Chase-Marshall, who hails from Trinidad, was raised in Washington, D.C., and was a classmate of the Clinton and Gore children. But despite having the clubby connections to wealth and power that headhunters prize for their potential to move the needle when it comes to selling expensive designer clothing, he was discounted, simply because of the color of his skin.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if someone is racist,\u201d Chase-Marshall says. \u201cI care if people use discriminatory hiring practices.\u201d His is neither a call for affirmative action nor a call for quotas\u2014which can undercut recognition of real talent\u2014but, rather, a call for education transparency and accountability that can create lasting change within the fashion industry.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019m proud of Chase-Marshall for pushing us beyond merely saying that we have the right to more than just exist and be seen in the fashion industry. It\u2019s our responsibility to demand, not only of fashion but also of our trendsetting selves, that our spending be reflected in the identities of the images marketed to us, as well as that our dollars come back into our communities through the black talent being paid and promoted according to their true worth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInspired by Muhammad Ali and Colin Kaepernick, Chase-Marshall, who currently engages in every type of freelance work, from designing pull-up diapers to diamond rings, wants to be the kind of person who \u201cprioritizes their integrity over their paycheck.\u201d He broke his silence \u201cbecause you can\u2019t continue to play a losing game.\u201d Now it\u2019s time for the powerful consumers black women are to suit up and make the fashion industry play ball.", "keywords": ["missing", "simply", "fashion", "black", "chasemarshall", "industry", "designer", "problem", "hiring", "talent", "designers", "action"], "polarity": 0.12858133650387174, "subjectivity": 0.4944134503993659},

I wanted to get a workout and a sweat in before the reading (which started at 8:15 p.m.), so I went to LA Fitness at 6 to hoop for an hour or so. Both the LA Fitness I frequent and the Brillobox are in Pittsburgh\u2019s East End. I live on the Northside, which meant I just wouldn\u2019t have time to leave the gym and drive home and shower before the reading. Which meant I\u2019d have to shower at LA Fitness\u2014the first time I\u2019d ever taken a shower in a public locker room.\n\n\n\n\u201cWait,\u201d I imagine some of you thinking. \u201cDidn\u2019t you play basketball in high school and college? How is this the first time you\u2019ve showered in a locker room?\u201d\n\nThis (the basketball thing) is true. And I did take showers in college. But that was in a private space with my teammates. A shower in a public space with dozens of strangers is an entirely different dynamic.\n\nBut before we dive into that, let\u2019s talk a little bit about the difference between showering as a high school athlete in your team\u2019s locker room and showering as a college athlete in your team\u2019s locker room. (Also, I must note that this experience may be men\u2019s-basketball-specific.)\n\nNo one showered in high school. You practiced or played in a game, you put your school clothes back on and then you went to Burger King. Showers happened at home, and I\u2019m not sure if the showers in my school\u2019s locker room even worked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, this showering dynamic has one major caveat: race. None of the guys I knew who went to predominantly black high schools or high schools with an even distribution of black and white kids showered in their locker rooms. It was more of a mixed bag, however, with the kids from predominantly white high schools. You still didn\u2019t have many locker room showerers, but you had some. Either way, if you happen to be out somewhere this winter and you happen to see a group of high school basketball players having a postgame meal at Applebee\u2019s, please know that they all probably smell like horse stables sprayed with Axe.\n\nThis dynamic changed in college. Now, not only did you shower\u2014you were commanded to. I remember an actual almost fight one of my teammates (\u201cRick\u201d) got into with an assistant coach over showering. He didn\u2019t get off the bench during the game, was pissed about it and got dressed after the game without showering. The coach ordered him to shower, saying that he wouldn\u2019t be able to board the plane back to Buffalo, N.Y., without one. Rick (who I think was 22 at the time) replied, \u201cI\u2019m a grown-ass fucking man. I know how much I sweated tonight. You\u2019re not gonna make me take a fucking shower.\u201d\n\nThey had to be separated. Rick \u201cwon\u201d and didn\u2019t have to shower because the head coach heard the commotion and ordered us all to hurry up and get on the bus. And since Rick was a bit of an asshole, too, he wet a paper towel, wiped his face with it and said, \u201cYou happy now?\u201d to the assistant, who turned beet red. It was the funniest thing I\u2019d ever seen. He got kicked off the team two months later.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyway, at LA Fitness Wednesday night, from the time I entered the locker room to the time I left after showering and getting dressed, roughly a half hour passed, and I\u2019d say 75 different men entered (and left) the locker room at some point. Most didn\u2019t shower, choosing instead to just change and leave or go to the bathroom. But of the ones who did shower, I was the only black guy.\n\nAlthough this observation is obviously limited to that particular time and circumstance, it matches up to what I\u2019ve observed over 20 years of experience in locker rooms at LA Fitness and Bally and the YMCA. White guys are just more likely to shower at the gym than black guys are.\n\n\n\n(Also, the older and whiter the guy, the more likely he\u2019s going to be walking around the locker room butt-ass naked, too. While most other men seem to try to get dressed as quickly as possible, these dudes will brush their teeth, trim their beards, text their stockbrokers and do Bikram yoga with their dicks out. I\u2019d say that roughly 89 percent of the visible penises in public men\u2019s locker rooms belong to white men over 50.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAgain, this is all anecdotal. There\u2019s no science behind these observations. But an informal poll of like seven people (all black) that I took yesterday reinforced it! (The black women I asked shared that white women seem to shower at the gym more frequently than they do.)\n\nDoes anyone have any theories about why this might be? (I have my own, but they\u2019re mostly terrible and I don\u2019t want to print them.) Also, for those who work out frequently at gyms, do you shower there?

I remember being in a room with people three times my age and feeling a bit out of place. Not only did age play a factor, but being a black woman in the cosmetic industry was something that was very new at that time.\n\nWhen I launched my online store at SuperstarNailLacquer.com, I did not post photos of me on my site so that people would not judge my product by a skin color, but by quality. I would get major calls from other brands wanting to collaborate with Superstar on some pretty amazing projects. It was disappointing to find that once these brands met with me in person, the deal went south for what they called \u201ccreative differences.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter so many times of experiencing disappointing outcomes, I decided that I would not let this stop me, so I began to study my industry, educating myself so I would know more than many of those I was meeting with. Over time, my business gained such success online; big brands couldn\u2019t ignore me any longer. One thing I learned from this is that no matter how others treat you, there is no room for excuses.

Because not only the pageant world, but the beauty industry as a whole has been making some major progress toward diversity.\n\nGIF\n\nEarly last fall, mega-brand CoverGirl shed its classic \u201cEasy, breezy, beautiful\u201d slogan for a fiercer campaign: \u201cI am what I make up.\u201d The brand also ushered in six new badass ambassadors\u2014including Issa Rae\u2014who bring their new mission of inclusivity front and center. And no current beauty conversation would be complete without mentioning Rihanna\u2019s September launch of Fenty Beauty. The launch shook the beauty community to its core, not only breaking the internet but also dispelling some long-held myths surrounding black women and makeup.\n\nSo why, in this melanin-winning back-to-back, inclusivity-embracing, post-Fenty era, are major brands still launching half-assed, lame attempts at diversity?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast week, Tarte Cosmetics, a popular brand known for its cult favorite Shape Tape concealer, launched the highly anticipated Shape Tape foundation. For weeks, Tarte built up the hype for the release with teaser emails and clickbait posts. So imagine the disappointment when thousands of followers flocked to the site, credit card in hand, ready to purchase, only to discover 13 shades of beige and two shades formulated for \u201cricher skintones.\u201d Swatches pictured online were tweeted and retweeted relentlessly.\n\nThe dragging that ensued on Tarte\u2019s timeline was not only epic but truly entertaining. The company eventually had to disable both its Instagram and Twitter comments in an attempt to silence all the negative publicity. Days after throwing shade at Fenty, rationalizing, doubling down on its stance and ignoring its customer base didn\u2019t work, the brand finally relented by posting a response to the outrage on Popsugar, promising more shades to come in the near future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn interesting post from POPSUGAR Beauty. Check it out! Read more Read\n\nBut by then it was already too late. Beauty influencers like Jackie Aina, Makeupshayla and Alissa Ashley took to their social media accounts and promptly got to roasting. It was so delicious, I almost stopped the videos to go grab marshmallows from the kitchen (every good roast has marshmallows).\n\n\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it\u2019s sad, really. Women of color have long been conditioned by makeup brands to be OK with being an afterthought. These manufacturers put little to no effort into the formulation of our shades, or the inclusion of more-diverse models. Instead, we\u2019ve typically been told:\n\n\n\nWomen of color typically don\u2019t invest in luxury makeup brands, meaning those shades don\u2019t sell.\n\n\n\nDeeper shades are more difficult to formulate.\n\n\n\nRicher colors will come out in future launches. We want to see how the product tests in the market first.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd in the past, we\u2019ve accepted these excuses as fact \u2026 until Fenty proved that the rhetoric was wrong:\n\n\n\nWomen of color historically didn\u2019t buy expensive brands because the three shitty shades you offered didn\u2019t match or wear well. As one Twitter user stated, \u201cif you only offer red, red as hell and what the hell, I\u2019m going to opt out.\u201d I can get the same horrible look with drugstore brands. I\u2019ll keep my $40. THANKS.\n\n\n\nIf you can formulate deeper eye shadow, lipstick and bronzer shades, then it stands to reason that foundation shades are not that much different. You employ chemists. Why am I mixing shades in my bathroom to try to get a perfect match? I\u2019m not Walter White.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGIF\n\nWhy should we have to wait for a future launch when the Christian Grey-worthy 50 shades of beige you just released could have been cut in half, and replaced with five to 10 deeper shades with golden, olive and neutral undertones?\n\n\n\nIn the end, it basically all comes down to one thing: SHADE.\n\nUnfortunately, Tarte just so happens to be the company that took the dragging this go-round, but far too many brands continue to operate in this manner. I remember rushing out and purchasing the Laura Mercier Translucent Loose Setting Powder, after hearing dozens of girls rave about how it \u201cdoesn\u2019t add color,\u201d has zero flashback in pictures and sets your makeup to perfection. Lies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe powder is stark white. It not only adds a white cast, but if you\u2019re any darker than Denise Huxtable, it\u2019ll have you looking casket ready, if you\u2019re not careful. That was at least five years ago. The brand JUST came out with ONE chocolate-girl-friendly shade last year.\n\n\n\nWomen of color are no longer being silent about their discontent. The bar has been raised, and your three obligatory WOC-friendly shades\u2014chestnut, mahogany and espresso\u2014are no longer going to cut it. We\u2019re not only vocally speaking out, but we\u2019re also speaking with our dollars. We\u2019re supporting brands that support us, because companies will continue to think it\u2019s OK to underrepresent WOC until we show them otherwise. And we can show them otherwise.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n", "keywords": ["tarte", "fenty", "going", "shades", "makeup", "beauty", "excluding", "color", "50", "brand", "launch", "brands", "beige"], "polarity": 0.05741824031149873, "subjectivity": 0.5061870214679204},

She competed in the 500-meter and the 1,500-meter races. Maame finished fourth in the quarterfinals for the 500-meter race, and last place in her 1,500-meter heat.

Her parents are Ugandan immigrants, and she and her siblings were born in the United States.

For now, the high school senior plans to host poetry workshops at local hospitals, she told The Root, helping to \u201cintroduce poetry as a form of emotional and mental healing.\u201d More than anything, she hopes she can spread her love for the written word as far as possible, and that other young people are inspired to speak out, too.\n\n\u201cI feel that too often, young people\u2019s voices are diminished and seen as [not valuable],\u201d Juliet told The Root. \u201cHowever, we form our world\u2019s future, and as a result, our voices and messages carry extraordinary weight, whether they be communicated through poetry, public speaking or any other form of the arts.\u201d\n\nGraphic: GMG, Photo: Rebecca Cabage (Invision/AP)\n\nSTORM REID\n\nCategory: Arts and Culture\n\nAge: 15 in July\n\nHometown: Atlanta\n\nSocial Media: Twitter, Facebook, Instagram\n\nThe message that representation matters cannot be overstated. Ava DuVernay\u2019s highly anticipated film A Wrinkle in Time, based on the 1962 fantasy novel by Madeleine L\u2019Engle, is the latest example. The book tells the story of Meg Murry, a teenage girl who travels on an adventure to rescue her father who is stuck in an alternate universe. Of course, the character in the book\u2014and the 2003 TV movie\u2014has always been portrayed as white.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUntil now.

In 2015, he was named Sports Kid of the Year by Sports Illustrated.\n\nBut Reece, who plans to attend the University of California, Berkeley, in the fall, is also very serious about his education. At the end of his junior year, he was focused on acing Advanced Placement exams and competing at the World Junior Championships.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBoth forced me to stay centered mentally in order to achieve success,\u201d he told The Root. \u201cStaying composed when the pressure is on is typically something that I need work on.\u201d\n\nAnd eyes are definitely on Reece. His name is bubbling up with Olympian swimmers like Simone Manuel, Cullen Jones and Lia Neal. Earlier in February, he broke two national high school records and lowered the national high school record in the 100-meter breaststroke. He\u2019s one of few black swimmers who have reached championship level in recent years. According to the USA Swimming Foundation, 64 percent of black children have low- to no swimming abilities.

Now, at 17, her company is worth almost $500,000. The line is sold online and in stores across the country, including Paper Source and Whole Foods.\n\nIn early March, she appeared on Good Morning America as part of its \u201cDeals and Steals\u201d segment that featured businesses owned by women.

He currently sells hoodies, track shorts, hats and T-shirts. His interest in fashion all started with his love of sneakers.\n\n\u201cThroughout high school, I noticed my classmates were always talking about shoes,\u201d Victor told The Root. \u201cIt eventually led me to learn about fashionable streetwear, which I began to purchase and collect. Streetwear and sneakers went hand in hand in my high school years and nothing has changed since.\u201d\n\nWithin a year of the launch of For the Leaux, the site had more than 100,000 visits and thousands of orders. The Houston native also gives back to his community.

Her IQ? 199.\n\n\u201cIf I see opportunity to go forward, I would say, \u2018Why slow it down?\u2019\u201d Thessalonika told the Chicago Tribune. \u201cIt\u2019s best to go through it and take advantage of the opportunity, because it will help other people as a whole; it will help businesses and society.\u201d\n\nWhen she was 5 years old, she sat in a plane and an air-show instructor showed her how it worked. As a kid, Thessalonika spent a lot of time at airports; her father was a manager at Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare International Airport.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe accompanied her mother to psychology classes, and ultimately became her mom\u2019s study partner. Those lessons stuck with her, and she decided to pursue a career in aviation psychology.

Then at 9, she learned how to code after her dad gave her a book on coding languages and started taking classes on technology skills website W3Schools. Keila had her first big speaking gig\u2014in front of more than 4,000 people\u2014at the Southern California Linux Expo in 2013. Her speech, titled \u201cUndefinable Me,\u201d has more than 70,000 hits on YouTube.\n\nKeila has taught at schools across the country, and at tech conventions from here to Prague in the Czech Republic. But she doesn\u2019t let that distract her from her schoolwork. Keila makes straight A\u2019s and is on the track team, and balances that with editing videos and learning new coding technology.\n\n\u201cWhat excites me about the future of tech is that so many kids of this generation have so much advanced background knowledge than ever before,\u201d she told The Root. \u201cI\u2019m really excited for what this generation is going to produce because the future looks so bright.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2016, she was also hired to do some social media work for Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti.

The 17-year-old techie created CopStop, an app that helps kids avoid police brutality, at his second hackathon. For the app, which was inspired by the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin, George consulted with activists, civil rights attorneys and police chiefs to help build out the app.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat pushed me even further to create the application was the idea that my little brother at 16 or 15 would feel the same way that I did around police officers,\u201d he told The Root. \u201cI want him to grow up in a world where he doesn\u2019t have to worry about being on the news as an African-American child.\u201d\n\nCopStop allows users to record their interaction with the police, providing an alternative to body cameras, which officers often can control, and also educates teens about dealing with the police. George, who is a senior at Alameda Community Learning Center, with hopes of going to the University of California at Los Angeles, knows that the work he is doing could have a great impact on marginalized communities.\n\nGeorge has been intrigued by technology for several years. At his first hackathon\u2014when he was 13\u2014he created \u201cConnect the Dots,\u201d a platform to help black students at predominantly white private schools navigate racism on their campuses. That experience is what launched him on a quest to learn more about coding and programming languages. For the past two summers, he\u2019s worked as a tech intern in the Oakland Mayor\u2019s Office.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen he was 16, George created his own tech company, George Hofstetter Technologies Inc., with a mission to \u201cchange the world\u2019s perspective on race by using technology,\u201d and he is hopeful that he can help change the demographics of Silicon Valley. George\u2019s latest venture is Up to Code, a mobile-learning technology, designed for middle schoolers, to help bridge the digital divide.\n\n\u201cThese big tech companies are creating the future and they\u2019re not including everyone,\u201d he told The Root. \u201cHow can you create a future for everyone without including everyone?

The fundraiser notched $100,000, after Oprah Winfrey matched the $50,000 Taylor had already raised.\n\n\u201cI want all girls\u2014especially black girls\u2014to know we can be anything we set our minds to especially in STEM [science, technology, engineering and math] fields,\u201d Taylor told The Root. \u201cGiving girls of color the opportunity to see films like this just may produce the next Ava or Oprah or Shirley Chisholm.\u201d\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the first time that Taylor, who hopes to one day be an astronaut, scientist and engineer, raised money so that young black girls could see themselves represented on-screen. In December 2016, she launched a fundraiser for kids to see Hidden Figures, the film that introduced so many of us to the black women at NASA who helped John Glenn orbit in space.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Taylor\u2019s head isn\u2019t only in the stars. She has spearheaded book drives in her community called Taylor\u2019s Take Flight With a Book, where she has collected more than 3,000 books for kids in her hometown, Jacksonville, Fla. She\u2019s also grounded in the fact that young people take action to fight for the future of our country.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important we as the next generation learn how our government works, but also know that we have power as well to make change,\u201d she told The Root. \u201cWe are not voiceless.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis year will be a busy year for Taylor.

Ohio doesn\u2019t have strict standards, so each district and its superintendent can decide on its own rules. For Ose, that won\u2019t cut it, especially when it comes to educating LGBTQ youth, who are often left out of the sexual-education conversation. Everyone should have access to proper reproductive-rights education\u2014and Ose is ready to keep pressing elected officials to make it happen.\n\n\u201cWhen my conservative, anti-LGBT legislators in Ohio think about their constituency, that includes queer black youth like myself,\u201d they told The Root. \u201cI want them to know that young people like me are watching their actions and are more than ready to vote them out of office and replace them in the years to come.\u201d\n\nOse, who is set to graduate high school this spring, accepted a full-ride scholarship to Ohio State University, where they will study international relations and sexuality studies. Ose was named GLSEN National Student Advocate of the Year for 2017.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cProviding visibility for queer young folk, especially queer young people of color, shows the larger community that we are here to stay,\u201d they said in an acceptance speech. \u201cGiving our voices space to advocate can only make us all stronger.\u201d\n\nCurrently, Ose is working on a five-part mini-docuseries highlighting the stories of queer young people across the country. The series will explore gender and sexuality, the failures of sexual-health education policies, and activism in the community. Looking to trailblazing LGBTQ activists, Ose is determined to make sure the spirit of action among LGBTQ youth is alive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYoung people, especially young people of color\u2014especially queer and trans young people of color\u2014have a rich history of activism that\u2019s been widely erased from American history textbooks,\u201d Ose told The Root. \u201cWe stand on the shoulders of amazing people like Marsha P.

He was in elementary school, and the 2008 presidential election was in full swing. He overheard one of his white classmates tell another that the only way then-Sen. Barack Obama would become president was \u201cbecause all the niggers would vote for him,\u201d Seun told The Root. At the time, he \u201cfelt a sense to fiercely challenge that\u201d idea.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTen years later, Seun is still speaking up and fighting back. In September, after white supremacist posters appeared on his school\u2019s campus at Penn State University, he quickly organized a Change.org petition, asking the university to condemn white supremacy and denounce Identity Evropa, the group responsible for the posters. Within 48 hours, hundreds of students had signed the petition\u2014and soon after, the university\u2019s president responded.\n\n\n\n\u201cTo be crystal clear\u2014white supremacy, or any other doctrine that elevates one group above another, has no place at Penn State, and we strongly condemn language and actions that promote racism, anti-Semitism, homophobia, violence, discrimination and other forms of hate,\u201d President Eric Barron\u2019s statement said.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt showed the power that students have when we organize and come together,\u201d Seun told The Root.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut that\u2019s not all. In June, he gave a TEDxTalk on how to build better relationships between communities and police departments.

Philadelphia\u2019s school district is slightly above average when it comes to black male educators\u20144 percent of its teachers are black men, compared with the national average of 2 percent. But Tamir knows we can do better\u2014and that black children deserve better.\n\n\u201cI know from my own experiences the impact of having a strong black male educator in your life, and I want to be that for someone else,\u201d he told Teach for America\u2019s One Day Magazine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor years, he\u2019d told his parents that he wanted to be a doctor\u2014but all of that changed because of the Black Male Educators for Social Justice program.

Regardless of how you may feel about her, your hate and a Grammy snub won\u2019t stop her shine. She signed big deals, had one of the biggest hits of the year (my current theme song/anthem), got big props from the Queen herself\u2014and despite rumors of a potential breakup, her boo Offset proposed to her with an 8-carat diamond ring. Cardi did 2017 big as hell, and we can only expect that will continue in 2018.\n\nTerry Crews\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt takes a black man who is strong in will and mind to display restraint and not beat the shit out of a perverted white man who gropes his genitals in full view of everyone at a Hollywood party. It takes an even stronger black man to come forward during the #MeToo storm and admit that he, too, was sexually violated by a powerful white man in Hollywood. That strong black man was Terry Crews.\n\nWhile some questioned why he didn\u2019t just pummel Adam Venit when the Hollywood power broker allegedly grabbed his genitals at a party, Crews showed that it\u2019s a game of chess, not checkers, and in the end, the sound mind wins. He filed a police report, filed a lawsuit and spoke out against sexual assault in Hollywood, letting everyone know that he would not be a victim. He was named one of Time magazine\u2019s \u201csilence breakers.\u201d He dropped WME\u2014the agency Venit worked for that basically did nothing to protect Crews and everything to protect Venit\u2014and moved on to new representation, all without being the stereotypical angry black man that everyone wanted or expected him to be.\n\nThat is the very definition of winning. Kudos, Terry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBarack Obama\n\nBarack Obama won 2017 the day he left office as the president of the United States. I am very sure it was like when Scarface quit his job in Half Baked.\n\nOur president started wearing less and going out more. He sent his wife a cute Valentine\u2019s Day tweet. He got crowds and applause just for being a regular-ass dude. People wanted so much more of him, the bidding war over his memoirs reached $60 million. He received the 2017 JFK Profile in Courage Award. He even reported for jury duty in Chicago. He basically showed everyone that leaving the presidency hasn\u2019t stopped his shine or his charisma, and your orange-colored Oompa Loompa of a president could never. Come through, Barack. Come through.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nColin Kaepernick\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNFL ratings are down, and league officials don\u2019t know what to do about it. Good. The NFL deserves whatever \u201cL\u2019s\u201d it gets because the NFL turned its back on Colin Kaepernick. Meanwhile, Kaepernick continues to shine. When he started his silent protests during the national anthem last year, he was widely criticized by people who didn\u2019t understand his need and desire to fight for black lives or the recognition he got for it. None of that matters. Despite it all, Kaepernick is living his best life. He has gotten award after award, and he is even considering buying an NFL team. Take that, NFL. Long live Colin Kaepernick.\n\nBlack Women\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2017 was the year of the black woman. From your Auntie Maxine Waters to Serena Williams winning the Australian Open while pregnant to Karen Bass\u2019 hilarious takedown of Jeff Sessions to black women showing up to guarantee Roy Moore did not win in Alabama to Tarana Burke and the #MeToo movement, black women were here for you. Black women have always been here for you. Black women will continue to be here for you. Now black women need you to be here for us.

I flew toward those words on Lit Cosmetics\u2019 Lit Metals Metallic Pigment Kit liquid metallic eye shadow box like a moth to a flame\u2014especially after learning that this was the same makeup used to create Oprah\u2019s look for her turn as Mrs. Which in the big-screen fantasy A Wrinkle in Time.\n\nThis water-based formulation makes it easy to use with contacts and safe for lash extensions; it\u2019s also paraben-, glycol- and alcohol-free, and its lightweight but easily buildable coverage makes it perfect for everyday wear (if you dare).\n\nApplication is an easy two-step process. First, dip the brush into the liquid adhesive and apply it to your eyelid, allowing about 30-60 seconds to dry. While it\u2019s still wet, dip the same brush into the pot of glitter\u2014which is ground so fine it looks like a powder\u2014and brush the glitter onto your lids.\n\nVoil\u00e0! The effect is instant, and the gold pigment is likely what you\u2019ve been looking for in a dry or cream shadow but could never find.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPersonally, I felt the liquid adhesive drying and tightening a little for about 15 minutes afterward, and was aware of feeling something on my lids for about a half hour before I got used to the feeling. A few tricks: Avoid the crease of your eye\u2014unless you have ample time to sit with your eyes closed, it\u2019s very difficult for the adhesive to dry in the fold in the lid, and it will feel sticky for long time. If it happens, just moisten a cotton swab with water and wipe it away. Also, make sure to comb your lashes out immediately afterward in case a stray sparkle goes rogue and lands in the base of your lashes.\n\nFor a more dimensional look, you can layer the adhesive and Lit Kit glitter over regular eye shadow. Another easy and quick day-to-night makeup transformation is to use the glitter as a liquid eyeliner\u2014it takes five minutes. For golden lids, Addicted is now my go-to color, and I used Smolder for a sleek and shimmering eyeliner. Lit Kits give you glittery glamour for $28.

Year after year, our list of Young Futurists reminds us that age really ain\u2019t nothin\u2019 but a number. That group of 15- to 22-year-olds always impresses us with their tenacity, passion and ability to turn big dreams into reality. Here, we take a look at a few members of the Class of 2016 and see where their paths to success have taken them in the last year.\n\n\n\nJoye Nettles\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen: Joye Nettles was a techie. She was initially recognized as a Young Futurist for her budding entrepreneurship skills at the College of Charleston, where she developed SpotIt, an Android app to help citizens of Charleston, S.C., find places to park. As a recent graduate of C of C, she had started working as a junior associate consultant at Thoughtworks, a global software development firm. Her ultimate goal? To open a school in South Carolina to inspire kids to pursue careers in technology.\n\n\n\nNow: Nettles is already using her passion for technology to inspire the next generation. In April 2016, Nettles launched Joye to the World with the hope of diversifying the tech industry and encouraging young people to explore technology and entrepreneurship. She has started the Mini Hackathon Tour, which is a series of events held at schools in South Carolina and Georgia, introducing more young people to the world of tech. At Thoughtworks, she was promoted to a consultant developer, where she is leading junior members of the team.\n\nRyan Rucker\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen: Ryan Rucker wanted to \u201crevolutionize the way people make reviews about everything.\u201d His first step toward making that dream a reality was his app Charmer, which he described as a \u201cfun and easy way to describe your friends and experiences.\u201d The best part? The reviews were just three words. \u201cWe are trying to make reviews like you see on Yelp or TripAdvisor, and we\u2019re trying to make them shorter, more simple and more mobile,\u201d he told The Root. \u201cIt\u2019s important for millennials to be able to share things\u2014and do it quickly.\u201d\n\nNow: Since being named a Young Futurist in 2016, Rucker has launched his startup Charmer on three college campuses: Berkeley, Harvard and Columbia. Most recently, he began hosting conversations about dating and relationships in the San Francisco Bay Area. The next session will focus on dating in the digital age.\n\nThomasena Thomas\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen: Thomasena Thomas was baking up a storm when we first profiled her as a Young Futurist in 2016. With FairyCakesSC, she would bring tasty desserts to her classmates and teachers within the halls of her South Carolina high school. She told The Root that it\u2019s important for young people to find their passion and to \u201cpursue it at any age.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat excites me most about baking is being able to brighten someone\u2019s day with the confections I bake,\u201d she said. \u201cBeing a teenage entrepreneur is hard work, but I love it.\u201d\n\nNow: Thomas graduated high school in May 2016 and is now studying political science and communications at the College of Charleston in South Carolina. Since then, she has been crowned Miss South Carolina Pearls for her \u201cexemplary civic leadership and community service involvement,\u201d she told The Root.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Miss South Carolina Pearls, she has traveled to dozens of schools to implement the career and technology education program for students in seventh through 12th grades and has raised awareness around domestic violence and sexual assault, among several other initiatives. Thomas is also still baking\u2014she instructs baking classes for low-income students as a partner for Wings for Kids with Florence and Charleston County school districts.\n\nArielle De Souza\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen: Arielle De Souza was busy diving deep into some of today\u2019s challenges. In February 2016, De Souza was finishing up her senior year at the University of Rhode Island as a double major in ocean engineering and French studies. She\u2019d just returned from studying and interning in France to learn more about off-shore energy sources. Upon graduating, she was heading to Paris to complete her master\u2019s in maritime engineering.\n\n\n\nNow: Summer 2016 was full of big opportunities for Arielle. She won the French Consulate in Boston Excellence Award for being an outstanding student during her time studying and interning in Paris. She was also a lead engineering instructor for the Launch Math and Science Center in New York City, a STEM camp for fourth-graders through eighth-graders who were learning robotics, coding and engineering concepts. As promised, she began her master\u2019s program in France and is expected to graduate\u2014yes, within a year\u2014with a degree in engineering in December, and she hopes to continue her career in Paris. She and her sister, Annelle, launched a blog called The De Souza Effect, which chronicles their adventures as two Afro-Caribbean students who are studying abroad.\n\nYara Shahidi\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen: Yara Shahidi stole our hearts as the smart and sassy Zoey on ABC\u2019s Black-ish, which helped land her a spot on our Young Futurists list. But Shahidi proved time and time again that she wasn\u2019t just another young actress. She was outspoken about issues that affect the black community and wanted to make sure she cultivated her career as much as possible in the roles that she took on. \u201cBefore I auditioned for Black-ish, I received scripts that portrayed black people in a negative and stereotypical way,\u201d she told the New York Times. \u201cBut Black-ish is a more positive portrayal of what it\u2019s like to be black in America.\u201d\n\n\n\nNow: Shahidi is still warming our hearts every week as Zoey on ABC\u2019s Black-ish. On cable network Freeform, Shahidi will reprise her role as smart and witty Zoey on her own spinoff show, Grown-ish, where viewers will follow her through college life. The series is set to premiere in January.\n\nShe was recently named as one of Forbes\u2019 30 under 30 in Hollywood. She continues to speak out on race and social justice issues and was recently awarded the Young, Gifted and Black Award at the 2017 BET Awards. In 2018 Shahidi will join the incoming freshman class at Harvard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJewell Jones\n\nThen: Jewell Jones was simply hoping to make big changes for his city of Inkster, Mich., in February 2016. He had recently been elected as a City Council member and hoped to revamp parks, improve roads and start to change the culture of the Police Department. \u201cI will be out there with our youth to make sure I\u2019m bringing up the next generation of change,\u201d he told the City Council on his first day on the job.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow: Jewell Jones kept his promise to us. In February 2016, he vowed to \u201ckeep on running\u201d for elected office. Then, on Jan. 1, he became Michigan\u2019s youngest elected representative. Jones, who is now 22 years old, recently sponsored a bill that would withhold funds from schools that use racially insensitive mascots, logos or insignias.\n\nSimone Biles\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen: We included Simone Biles on our Young Futurists list just a few months before she dominated at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics. The then 19-year-old also had won 14 world-championship medals, 10 of those medals gold\u2014the most won by a female gymnast, according to the Associated Press.\n\n\n\nNow: As expected, Simone Biles killed it at the Rio de Janeiro Games. She was the all-around champion in the women\u2019s individual competition for gymnastics, becoming the second black woman to do so, after Gabby Douglas. Earlier in November, Biles returned to the mat for the first time in more than a year. She is also a spokeswoman for Girls on the Run, an organization that seeks to inspire girls to run and gain self-confidence.", "keywords": ["young", "recently", "2016", "told", "studying", "world", "black", "futurists", "shahidi", "school", "carolina", "south", "changing"], "polarity": 0.13964610389610388, "subjectivity": 0.39927869605142324},

Female drivers\n\nb. Black children\n\nc. White men\n\nThe correct answer is c.\n\nThat\u2019s not hyperbolic conjecture meant to incite a reactionary response. These are actual choices Facebook used to train the thousands of censors responsible for regulating hate speech on the site. In a new investigative report, ProPublica recently reviewed a trove of Facebook\u2019s internal documents that reveal how the company\u2019s policy protects the woefully oppressed white men but allows white supremacist groups and anti-Muslim speech.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor instance, after last month\u2019s terrorist attacks, Facebook didn\u2019t have a problem when Rep. Clay Higgins (R-La.) posted this status:\n\nOf course, some would say that a U.S. official publicly stating that it is OK to kill members of a certain religion is the definition of \u201cun-American,\u201d but others would argue that it is part of his God-given right to free expression, and Facebook has a responsibility to protect his First Amendment rights\u2014which is all true.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo why, then, did Facebook delete Black Lives Matter activist and poet DiDi Delgado\u2019s post when she posted the following:\n\nIn case you\u2019re wondering, the scratched-out word is \u201cracist.\u201d\n\nFacebook can explain it clearly. White people are what it calls a \u201cprotected category\u201d\u2014a large group of people whom it protects against hate speech. Facebook argued that Higgins\u2019 (must we still put the little \u201cR\u201d beside his name to designate that he is a Republican? Do you know of any Democrats named \u201cClay\u201d besides Clay Davis from The Wire?) post was only directed at radicalized Muslims, which is a subset of a protected class, like black children, anyone overweight, anti-racism protesters, old people or female drivers. Apparently Facebook is perfectly fine with people suggesting that those groups be killed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to ProPublica, Facebook also bans any \u201ccalls for exclusion,\u201d but apparently white men are excluded from this, too. Why do I say this?\n\nBecause the white supremacist rants of Jeremy Christian\u2014the man who went on a racist stabbing spree on a Portland, Ore., commuter train\u2014are still on the site even after he asked his followers to join him in physically attacking Hillary Clinton supporters;\n\nBecause Sean Urbanski\u2014who allegedly stabbed Army Officer Richard Collins III to death\u2014was a member of a neo-Nazi Facebook group called Alt Reich: Nation. The page is still up;\n\nBecause Facebook does not allow discrimination for any reason based on religion, but Mark Zuckerberg publicly exempted Donald Trump from this policy when the manila-envelope-colored dope announced his travel ban;\n\nBecause Facebook uses the State Department\u2019s list of terrorist organizations to ban certain groups, but a cursory search on Facebook returned more than 122 Ku Klux Klan groups (I actually stopped counting) and more Nazi groups than there were actual Nazis during World War II.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut these are white men, so it\u2019s OK if they call for white people to \u201chunt\u201d Muslims, as long as they don\u2019t call out white people for being racist. It\u2019s OK for violent hate groups to congregate on the site, as long as their terrorist activities are limited to knives slitting black throats. Facebook is perfectly OK with it. Facebook has written it down and trained 4,000-plus people to recognize it when they see it. Even Clay Higgins knows it.\n\nBut if you want to speak out against white men on Facebook, well, then, as the iconic, fictional Baltimore city councilman and philosopher Clay Davis once said:\n\n\u201cSheeeeeeiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit.\u201d", "keywords": ["white", "ban", "clay", "muslims", "black", "ok", "protected", "site", "children", "groups", "terrorist", "men", "talking", "facebook"], "polarity": 0.010840848965848967, "subjectivity": 0.3464381914381913},

The three-time Academy Award nominee, who won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for 2016\u2019s Fences\u201a is a regular on the awards circuit and is often called the \u201cblack Meryl Streep\u201d\u2014to which she rightly responds, \u201c[then] pay me what I\u2019m worth.\u201d\n\n\n\nIndeed, it\u2019s Davis\u2019 frank, fearless and unfailing honesty\u2014in her acting roles, her rising visibility as an advocate for equal rights and pay, and her willingness to talk about her own experiences of poverty and sexual abuse\u2014that has so endeared her to us.\n\nSo it\u2019s no surprise that Davis didn\u2019t hold back when speaking to digital magazine Porter Edit about the game-changing opportunity that came with playing Annalise Keating, the character that elevated her from supporting film roles into a leading\u2014and sexually liberated\u2014lady of television drama:\n\nI\u2019m 52 and darker than a paper bag. Women who look like me are relegated to the back of the bus, auditioning for crackheads and mammas and the person with a hand on her hip who is always described as \u2018sassy\u2019 or \u2018soulful\u2019. I\u2019ve had a 30-year career and I have rarely gotten roles that are fleshed out, even a little bit. I mean, you wouldn\u2019t think [these characters] have a vagina. Annalise Keating has changed the game. I don\u2019t even care if she doesn\u2019t make sense. I love that she\u2019s unrestricted, that every week I actually have to fight [showrunner] Peter Nowalk not to have another love scene. When does that ever happen?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat liberation has also been a revelation for Davis, who had to tap into a previously unexplored aspect of her tremendous talent to be free enough to play a woman in touch with her own sexuality and desire. Part of that process was realizing that sexiness doesn\u2019t only come in one package:\n\n... because very rarely in my career \u2013 and in my life \u2013 have I been allowed to explore that part of myself, to be given permission to know that is an aspect of my humanity, that I desire and am desired. I always felt in playing sexuality you have to look a certain way, to be a certain size, to walk a certain way. Until I realized that what makes people lean in is when they see themselves. There\u2019s no way I am going to believe that all women who are sexualized are size zero or two, all have straight hair, all look like sex kittens every time they go to bed and want sex from their man, all are heterosexual. I am mirroring women. I always say it is not my job to be sexy, it\u2019s my job to be sexual. That\u2019s the difference.\n\nDavis goes on to discuss the wage gap in Hollywood, referencing the recent move by actress Jessica Chastain to ensure that she and her Oscar-winning co-star Octavia Spencer would make equal pay on their next film together. Says Davis: \u201cCaucasian women have to stand in solidarity with us. And they have to understand we are not in the same boat.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd as both a Hollywood heavyweight and a survivor of sexual abuse, when asked if the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements would have gained momentum if brought forward by women of color, she is emphatically clear:\n\nNo. Recy Taylor came forward in 1944 when she was gang raped by six men in Alabama. Tarana Burke was the founder of the #MeToo movement in 2006. There are plenty of black women who have come forward. I don\u2019t think people feel we deserve the same empathy. Or investment. We are not as valued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavis has plenty more to say on the hypocrisy of Hollywood and how she navigates it as a black woman.

In 1999 she developed designer Giorgio Armani\u2019s makeup line\u2014in my opinion, still one of the top three foundation formulations and shade ranges on the market. In 2004 she was named creative director of Procter & Gamble cosmetics, which includes lines like SK-II, Dolce & Gabbana and CoverGirl. In 2013 Queen Elizabeth II named McGrath an MBE, or Member of the Order of the British Empire, for services to the fashion and beauty industries.\n\nMcGrath finally founded her own eponymous collection in 2015 based around highly pigmented lipsticks and eye shadows. Without fail, lines around the block accompany each new limited edition launch at her freestanding New York City store, and within hours, her website sells out of her flawlessly curated $125 eye shadow palettes and $38 lipsticks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI worked with McGrath and her team a month ago for the British Fashion Awards and still missed my chance to score the last two offerings of her Matte Trance lipstick and new Lip Fetish lip balm.

McGrath has timed the release of these shades so that her fans can use the same makeup she\u2019ll be using during February\u2019s Milan Fashion Week.

Admittedly, he\u2019s not a marching kind of guy, but he absolutely believes in the power of protest and making himself \u201cheard.\u201d His personal protest? Picking up his camera and hitting the streets of Washington, D.C.; Brooklyn, N.Y.; and Philadelphia with the goal of photographing 1,000 black men.\n\n\u201cI wanted to flood the internet with positive images of black men to counteract the negative imagery that we\u2019ve seen for years,\u201d Summers said during a phone interview with The Root.\n\nAlthough it began as a digital project (you can check out the portraits here), Summers\u2019 \u201cWe Love You\u201d project recently expanded into a physical art installation on the wall of Union Market, a popular destination in Northeast D.C. Passersby are greeted with the faces of about 30 portraits of black men dressed in black T-shirts. The collection of faces creates a striking display of unity and representation in a quickly gentrifying area.\n\n\u201cI want viewers to take away that black men are people in our communities,\u201d says Summers, who has photographed 425 black men so far. \u201cFirst and foremost, we are human beings and should be treated as such. I want people to get familiar with our faces, to know that we are not a threat.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Root: How did you come up with the idea for the \u201cWe Love You\u201d project?\n\nBryon Summers: There\u2019s a lot that came together to form this idea. It was around the time when the news was reporting the deaths of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile. That was around the same time the last cop in the Freddie Gray case had gotten off. The climate in the country is crazy, and I had a lot of built-up frustration. As a photographer, I wanted to use my skills to change the narrative about black men.\n\nTR: What do you hope to accomplish with this project?\n\nBS: I want to flood the internet with positive images of black men to counteract the negative imagery that we\u2019ve seen for years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI see all of these black men\u2014and black women\u2014being misrepresented in the news. Whether it\u2019s malicious for these channels to push out negative images, I don\u2019t know. But if you see that negative imagery over years, it has an effect on you. It can brainwash you so that when you\u2019re walking down the street in a hoodie, they cross the street or, worse, they follow you because they think you\u2019re a threat. Or they call the police because they think you\u2019re a suspicious person.\n\nTR: What are the criteria for men to participate?\n\nBS: We put out the invitation on social media that\u2019s the same for every city. We ask for black males of all ages, and we strongly suggest you bring a black T-shirt. That\u2019s all you need.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: What has the reaction been to the series so far?\n\nBS: Overall, people are grateful for the project. The people that have come out, almost all of them have said \u201cThank you\u201d or \u201cThis is very necessary.\u201d A lot of people don\u2019t feel comfortable going to march, putting themselves in harm\u2019s way. Or they\u2019re scared to get teargassed. They may feel more comfortable coming to a designated location and taking a portrait. This is a way that people can digitally march. You might take a picture by yourself, but when you put it together with other men, you can get to that point where it\u2019s a \u201cMillion Man Digital March.\u201d\n\nTR: What\u2019s been the best response so far?\n\nBS: My dad is about to be 61 and he\u2019s on the wall. He doesn\u2019t use social media. But his friends called to say, \u201cHey, your photo is down here on the wall on Sixth Street!\u201d That\u2019s a proud moment for him. Some kids from a nearby school walked over with their teacher. They pass the wall every day, and now they see familiar faces from their neighborhood. It\u2019s a reassuring feeling for them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTR: I shared a picture of the wall on social media when I passed it yesterday. My following is mostly women. The first reaction was, \u201cThat\u2019s so dope!\u201d and then they wanted to know, \u201cWill he do one for women, too?\u201d\n\nBS: Yes. The goal is to shoot 1,000 women once I get 1,000 black men. Black women have been very supportive. They bring the men out to the shoots. Before I take the portraits, I shake the guy\u2019s hand and ask what brought him out. He always laughs and says, \u201cMy mother(/wife/girlfriend/sister) told me to do this!\u201d I hope it\u2019s the same way when I focus on the women. I hope that dads and husbands and brothers and boyfriends and sons bring them out, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe \u201cWe Love You\u201d project is hosting an open call for black boys and men of all ages on Saturday, Oct. 15, 10 a.m.-5 p.m., at Union Market, Sixth Street entrance, in Washington, D.C.

Forbes repoorts that the NBA initiated a licensing partnership with Bridges, granting him the rights to manufacture his products with NBA logos and distribute them through the company\u2019s online store as well as retail outlets.\n\n\u201cMoziah\u2019s creativity and entrepreneurial spirit are an inspiration, and we are thrilled about the launch of the Mo\u2019s Bows NBA Collection,\u201d Lisa Piken Koper, NBA vice president of global partnerships, told Forbes. \u201cWe are always looking for ways to diversify our merchandise offerings and cater to our fashionable fan base, and couldn\u2019t be more excited that fans will have a fun and unique way to show support for their favorite NBA teams.\u201d\n\n\n\nAccording to Forbes, Moziah signed a deal worth seven figures with a league that is on track to make $6 billion in revenue this year\u2014and that is all thanks to a little bit of hustle.\n\nMoziah and his mother, Tramica, appeared on Shark Tank in 2014, and there they met entrepreneur and fashion mogul Daymond John, creator of FUBU, who invested in the teen\u2019s business. Moziah was only 12 years old at the time, but he made a big impression, and John used his own network and connections to help take him to the next level.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen I do deals in Shark Tank and in business, I always look at the person first,\u201d John told Forbes. \u201cAnd when I first met Mo and his mother in the Tank, it reminded me so much of my mother and me. Here was a young man with a great vision and a mother with a strong business sense that was able to keep him grounded. Having both sides of the business equation is always key.\u201d\n\n\n\nWith John\u2019s help, the Mo\u2019s Bows brand landed on the shelves of luxury retailers like Neiman Marcus and Bloomingdale\u2019s, and sales exploded. At the same time, people began to take notice of Moziah himself, and the young man was invited to the White House by then-President Barack Obama and named one of Time magazine\u2019s most influential teens of 2015. ESPN hired him to be a fashion correspondent for its 2015 NBA draft telecast, and his company made handmade bow ties for all the draft picks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf Moziah\u2019s deal with the NBA, John told Forbes: \u201cThis is the sort of partnership that is an absolute game changer. Mo is someone that continues to inspire me, because I remember I had to wait a number of years to get an NBA license for FUBU. Meanwhile, Mo is still a teen and has the opportunity to align with an international brand like the NBA. This sort of deal will allow Mo to reach a whole new demographic and continue pushing his brand in an amazing direction.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy goal has always been to make Mo\u2019s Bows a household name for kid entrepreneurship and men\u2019s accessories,\u201d Moziah told Forbes. \u201cPartnerships like this one will help me reach my goals of having a full clothing line by the time I graduate from college. It feels really good to know a major company like the NBA believes in me and my vision to shake up the world through fashion.\u201d\n\nOn top of all that, Moziah was also named earlier this year as one of The Root\u2019s Young Futurists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoziah Bridges At 15, Moziah Bridges is already the best dressed in the room, brightening up an event with his\u2026 Read more Read\n\nThe Young Futurists is an annual list composed of 25 of the best and brightest young people in the country, ages 15 to 22.

Wearing traditional head wraps, cloaked in clouds of Marabou feathers fresh off the couture runway of Saint Laurent, the two wonderful women\u2014both of whom I\u2019m lucky enough to call friends\u2014epitomize regal beauty.\n\n\n\nIman\u2014well, she\u2019s Iman. What more needs to be said? \u201cBaby Girl Imaan,\u201d as I call her; she\u2019s the model of the moment. She has already appeared on multiple Vogue covers and is slaying it one sexy step at a time on every designer runway from New York to Tokyo.\n\nIn his monthly letter, Vogue Arabia Editor-in-Chief Manuel Arnaut writes of his choice of this iconic issue\u2019s cover girls:\n\nI truly believe that a cover should also encapsulate a message of hope and go above and beyond just a pretty image. This is exactly what we tried to achieve when we invited two of the biggest models with strong ties to the Arab world to be our March cover stars.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRight now, fashion-philes are hoofing it all over the globe to get their hands on one of the special-edition issues, where Iman shares her thoughts on her lifelong career in fashion, from being discovered as a model in 1975 to her fight for equal pay as a black model. (It\u2019s a fight black models continue to wage every day; just last week, Naomi Campbell posted on Instagram that she contended with the same issue last December when she shot the Swarovski campaign.)\n\nIman also speaks openly to Vogue about reconciling her religion with her career. She says, \u201cIt is an oxymoron to have your foot in the modeling business and to call yourself a Muslim, but at the end of the day, you need to look in the mirror and feel good when you ask, \u2018Am I doing the right thing?\u2019\u201d\n\nHammam, like every other black model walking the runway and smiling for the camera today, praises Iman for paving the way for all black girls. Hamman tells Vogue that she is also fiercely proud of being at the forefront of the ongoing diversity movement. \u201cFashion is all about having a personality\u2014and nothing is as inspiring as the power of being you,\u201d she says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScreenshot: Patrick Demarchelier (Vogue.me)\n\nThe choice of head wraps for the cover at once inspires pride and curiosity about the history of the head wrap. Nnenna Stella, owner of Brooklyn, N.Y.-based the Wrap Life, created the cover look using a prototype for a forthcoming collection of traditional scarves, which will retail on her website for a reasonable $24-$27.\n\nLanding any cover, let alone a historic and collectible cover like the anniversary issue of Vogue Arabia, was literally the answer to this entrepreneur\u2019s prayers. \u201cI\u2019ve never wrapped that way before,\u201d Stella says of the Nefertiti-esque black-and-white silk-chiffon turbans created for the cover. \u201cMy fingers were just flowing, and that is essentially what I tell my clients to do.\u201d The Wrap Life\u2019s head wraps are 2 yards long and between 22 and 24 inches wide. \u201cA wrap is just a piece of fabric,\u201d she says. \u201cEverything else we wear, like pants, are precut for us so we know how to wear it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIronically, Stella did not grow up wearing head wraps. She tells The Glow Up that when she founded the Wrap Life five years ago, \u201cI was waitressing, and really sad about it; my photography career wasn\u2019t working out.\u201d After 30 days of an ad hoc self-discovery workshop\u2014which, among other things, included keeping a journal marked \u201cWild Things Can Happen\u201d\u2014she wanted to change up her look as part of the spiritual reboot.\n\n\u201cNormally, you\u2019d just get a lipstick or a haircut,\u201d Stella says. But she was looking for that \u201cone extra thing [she] could do.\u201d That extra form of expression turned out to be wearing a head wrap. The look quickly became her signature, and when she couldn\u2019t find head wraps she liked online, it became her business. In her words: \u201cIt\u2019s instantly transformative to have a beautiful piece of fabric on your head.\u201d\n\nScreenshot: Patrick Demarchelier (Vogue.me)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaster makeup artist Porsche Cooper\u2014a favorite of elite photographers; brands like Tiffany and Est\u00e9e Lauder; and stars like supermodel Joan Smalls and singer Andra Day\u2014told The Glow Up:\n\nDiversity and equal representation in the beauty and fashion industries is a hard-fought and necessary cause, so to be a part of pushing the cause and conversation along is a great honor. To have my iconic muse Iman, and new muse Imaan Hammam, on the anniversary Vogue Arabia cover at once is my wildest fantasy come true. Two melanin queens clad in couture on a total of three covers that will wrap the globe ... I could not be more thrilled.\n\nThe Glow Up couldn\u2019t agree more.\n\n", "keywords": ["vogue", "wraps", "imaan", "issue", "wrap", "arabias", "head", "black", "model", "iman", "cover", "look", "stella", "anniversary"], "polarity": 0.19964268535697108, "subjectivity": 0.5408283515426373},

I say that because, often, clothes can be pretty but puzzling at the same time. Now, under the direction of designer Maria Grazia Chiuri, Dior speaks to women loud and clear. What\u2019s Grazia Chiuri got to say? For one, \u201cWe Should All Be Feminists\u201d\u2014the theme of her breakout collection for the house of Dior for Spring 2017.\n\nThe theme was taken from the essay of the same name written by the Nigerian writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, a brilliant manifesto on womanhood and citizenship that reads like the Wakandan Bill of Rights. Most people who wear the now ubiquitous T-shirt don\u2019t know its origin, but they\u2019ve gotten the message that the future is female.\n\nChimamanda Ngozi Adichie (Ted Talks)\n\nWhich brings us to Wednesday\u2019s Dior Fall/Winter 2018/2019 presentation in Paris, where Dior\u2019s women were still on the march. The collection was inspired by Paris\u2019 \u201cyouthquake\u201d in the summer of 1968, when students literally took to the streets, ripping cobblestones from the ground and hurling them at police, demanding better employment opportunities and reform of the university system. Being ever fashion-minded, young women protested long hemlines in front of the Dior boutique, brandishing signs reading, \u201cSupport the Mini Skirt.\u201d\n\nGrazia Chiuri, who is Italian and the former designer of Valentino, stumbled upon the photo while searching Dior\u2019s archives, as she recounted to London\u2019s Guardian newspaper:\n\nAnd then I discovered that [Marc] Bohan\u2019s response, [who designed Dior at the time], to this was to introduce the Miss Dior line, to give these younger consumers what they wanted. I thought it was so interesting to see fashion listening to women. And there is something about now that is similar to 1968. This is another moment when everything is changing.\n\nYes, we are again in a moment when everything is changing regarding women in the workplace and shaping the perception of our own beauty and our bodies. With the advent of social media\u2014which in this writer\u2019s opinion has done as much for black women\u2019s beauty as hip-hop has done for black men\u2019s voices\u2014we are in an era of unparalleled agency on our own behalf. Grazia Chiuri is listening, and poised to provide us the uniform.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDior Fall 2018 Paris Runway (Dominique Charriau/Getty/WireImage) Dior Fall \u201918 Paris Runway (Dominique Charriau/Getty/WireImage) Dior Fall \u201918 Paris Runway (Dominique Charriau Getty/WireImage) Dior Fall \u201918 Paris Runway (Dominique Charriau Getty/WireImage) 1 / 4\n\nThe clothes at Dior this week were a throwback to a time when flower power and femininity were one and the same. Long, easy dresses in bright floral prints, patchwork coats and rose-colored glasses to no doubt help us get through dark times sailed down the runway with a youthful ease. Mixed in were sweaters emblazoned with slogans like \u201cC\u2019est non, non et non\u201d (\u201cIt\u2019s no, no and no\u201d), in a nod to the new-age rules of sexual consent.\n\nAnother strong theme shown at Dior and trending across runways from New York, London, Milan and now Paris this season were relaxed boxy blazers worn over kilts and pleated skirts. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s so much that designers want women to be schoolgirls, but it\u2019s a way to show that women are teaching the world right now\u2014and changing the rules for the better.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarch on, ladies. On this first day of Women\u2019s History Month, we owe our mothers a debt and our daughters a future of freedom and dignity for womanhood across the globe. But in order to get there, to paraphrase Adichie, \u201cWe all need to be feminists.\u201d", "keywords": ["fall", "runway", "theme", "grazia", "woman", "non", "dior", "hear", "week", "fashion", "women", "paris", "chiuri", "dominique"], "polarity": 0.19603805916305916, "subjectivity": 0.4551037157287158},

Needless to say, my brown-skin-color bra didn\u2019t really come out that great, and I was left with a mess in the dormitory bathroom.\n\nYears later, the quest for the perfect matching nude for women with tan or brown skin is still an issue. And in 2015, when Nubian Skin founder Ade Hassan launched her brand, it was because she decided it was time for \u201ca different kind of nude.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI came up with the idea in 2011. I was working and in consulting at the time, but I always wanted to do something entrepreneurial. A frequent problem that I had was ... when I wanted to wear hosiery that was my skin color. I think any black woman or woman of color usually crossed their fingers when they saw brown tights, but when they get them home, they were ashy,\u201d Hassan told The Root.\n\nIt was then that Hassan decided to take nude matters into her own hands, and in 2013 she started to trademark the company and flesh out a business plan.\n\n\u201cWe launched in 2014, and our campaign went viral in August that year. The reception over the last couple of years has been pretty amazing. Personally, I\u2019m grateful to black women who saw those images and reposted and retweeted and shouted about it so much that mainstream media finally picked it up,\u201d Hassan said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCurrently, Nubian Skin consists of lingerie and hosiery and, now, nude shoes that include heels and ballet flats. Not only can you find the products on the company\u2019s site, but Hassan\u2019s products are also at major retailers like Nordstrom and online at ASOS.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe shoes are online only, and it was just another thing where people went, like, \u2018OMG, I can finally have a nude for me,\u2019\u201d Hassan noted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe popularity of Nubian Skin has consistently risen over the last couple of years, but when it comes to other nude products that specifically cater to women of color, there\u2019s still a definite disconnect in the beauty and fashion industries. Sure, Christian Louboutin has a line of nude shoes, but can the average person randomly drop $875 for a pair of shoes, just to find the perfect brown? Of course not, but you don\u2019t have to with Nubian Skin around. With prices ranging from $94 to $124, you\u2019re not going to miss a car payment just to look fashionable.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say that Hassan, who could be considered a veteran in the nude game for women of color, has paved the way for other entrepreneurs looking to cater to those with brown skin. And in the world of cosmetics, where black women collectively spend an estimated $7.5 billion annually, you can\u2019t really say there are a lot of options out there if you want a nude look, especially when it comes to lipstick and nail polish. But that\u2019s where Mented Cosmetics hopes to fill the void.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMented Cosmetics is the brainchild of Harvard Business School graduates K.J. Miller and Amanda E. Johnson, and currently consists of nude lipsticks and nail polishes catering to women of color and our version of \u201cnude.\u201d\n\nMiller, who comes from a retail background, met Johnson at Harvard, from which they both graduated in 2014. Johnson, who has an investment banking background, said that the two women launched Mented last fall.\n\n\u201cWe knew we wanted to do a start-up together in business school. We just clicked,\u201d explains Johnson. \u201cAnd after school, we would meet up, and with my digital background and her retail background, we knew we were well suited for a company.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring a random conversation about makeup and beauty hacks, Johnson said they both realized that nudes for brown women were missing\u2014and that\u2019s how the idea came about.\n\n\u201cThere was something missing in the market for women of color when it came to nude lipsticks. It\u2019s something that should be a part of every woman\u2019s beauty routine, but it was missing,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nAfter heading to Sephora to try to see what it offered women of color in nude\u2014products that didn\u2019t include manipulating brown lip liner and pink lipstick to make it happen\u2014the women knew how important making a nude lipstick line was.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen it came to the research and development, Miller and Johnson were hands on.\n\n\u201cWe went to every makeup counter asking for nude lip, but they couldn\u2019t do it. So we said, \u2018OK, let\u2019s see if we can do it on our own,\u2019\u201d Miller said.\n\n\u201cWe then reached out to manufacturers all over the East Coast, explaining our concept and wanting to create nude shades for women of color, but they didn\u2019t get it. They wanted us to pick from their stock colors. But there were these pale pinks and super-dark browns. We taught ourselves how to make lipsticks with the aid of the internet. We crafted every single shade in our line,\u201d Miller said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd for those wondering, Mented lipsticks, which sell for $16.50, are vegan, paraben-free, nontoxic and cruelty free and proudly made in the USA.\n\nBy now you\u2019ve probably seen Mented posts on Facebook and Instagram, and the company has received praises for its products.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMiller, Johnson and Hassan didn\u2019t wait for someone else to make products that cater to them; they took matters into their own hands.\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to business, social media plays a huge role nowadays. Hassan noted that it\u2019s easier for people to launch their brands without spending a lot of money because you can easily develop a social media following.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really lucky in this day and age, because historically, it\u2019s been hard if you didn\u2019t have the money to advertise on TV or magazines, if you didn\u2019t have thousands or millions of dollars. Nowadays, with social media, you just need great images that are true to your brand,\u201d Hassan says. \u201cYou just need your phone and images; that\u2019s it. Be on social media and use it to your advantage. Use it to your advantage. You just need your phone.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMented used Instagram to their benefit by sending their products to influencers to garner feedback, which Miller says has been great.\n\n\u201cCustomers really enjoy feeling and being prioritized by a beauty brand,\u201d Miller said.\n\nCurrently, Mented has nine lipsticks and three nail polishes, but they plan on launching more products.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe feel Mented is a full-fledged beauty brand. This fall we\u2019ll be releasing lip gloss, and next year we\u2019ll move on to eyes and cheeks. We\u2019re going to introduce eye shadow palettes as well as blush and highlighter. From there, it\u2019ll be full face,\u201d Miller said.\n\nWith Nubian Skin and Mented Cosmetics giving women of color more options, you will probably see larger companies popping up with their own versions. But when you have companies that are for us and by us and are paving the way, I at least know who\u2019s going to get my coins.", "keywords": ["miller", "hassan", "browns", "fashion", "women", "nude", "didnt", "comes", "beauty", "nudes", "color", "brown", "mented", "johnson", "skin"], "polarity": 0.14523956496178714, "subjectivity": 0.4843601802861061},

Case in point: For the first time since Naomi Campbell\u2019s opening strut back in 1997, Prada tapped a black model to open its fashion show (Jourdan Dunn is the only other black model to be booked by this global powerhouse brand since 2008). The coveted career-making position went to 19-year-old Sudanese model of the moment, Anok Yai.\n\nPrada\n\nYai, who was raised in Egypt, was discovered when photographer Steven Hall\u2019s Afrocentric street-style blog The Sunk posted a photo of her at Howard\u2019s 2017 homecoming that went viral last fall. Now exploding with over 144,000 Instagram followers, she\u2019s poised to blow all the way up.\n\nLuckily, Yai happens to be represented by Kyle Hagler, president of Next Models. Hagler, one of the most powerful agents in the business, also happens to be black. Booking Prada is a triumph for model and agent alike, and though, in my opinion, the brand has a very long way to go before I would support it with my dollars or clicks, it is clearly evolving.\n\nBut overall, Milan showed a lot of beautiful black women on its fall runways. Natural hair and glowing skin were the order of the day, from Versace to Fendi.\n\nAt Versace, \u201990s neon brights mixed with punk and ska-inspired plaid and black-and-white checks were the theme. Mixed patterns and bright colors are classic vintage Versace\u2014an exuberant kind of youth riot that fashion insiders and consumers can\u2019t seem to get enough of, judging by the FX hit miniseries American Crime Story: The Assassination of Gianni Versace, not to mention the number of Versace heritage prints I once again see people wearing on the streets of New York.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProving that the trend is catching, Prada was also full of neon brights and industrial-inspired designs that reminded me a bit of designer Virgil Abloh\u2019s aesthetic at Off-White.\n\nVersace Fall/Winter 2018 (Catwalking/Getty Images) Versace Fall/Winter 2018 (Catwalking/Getty Images) Versace Fall/Winter 2018 (Catwalking/Getty Images) Versace Fall/Winter 2018 (Catwalking/Getty Images) Versace Fall/Winter 2018 (Catwalking/Getty Images) 1 / 5\n\nFendi never disappoints. With furs and leather goods designed for the last 50 years by Karl Lagerfeld in collaboration with the Fendi sisters, it\u2019s fashions oldest and longest-lasting collaboration, but the point of view is always fashion-forward and fresh.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFall/Winter 2018 at Fendi felt like streetwear cool meets a socialite from Wakanda\u2019s Jabari tribe on a Swiss ski holiday in Gstaad. Fendi captured exactly the way I want to look when it\u2019s frosty outside: Fabulous mink capes with appliqu\u00e9d florals and mink logo-printed sweatshirts came swishing down the runway, carried on perfectly padded shoulders that looked just right for the moment.

But the collection never quite seems to get its props, likely because the label lacks the flash of a star designer or the power derived from dressing celebrities necessary for a fashion house to capture a place in pop culture.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I do like its take on dressing women\u2014it\u2019s sensible and sexy in the same breath\u2014with wonderful choices for women who wear the hijab. Too often, this crucial segment of designers\u2019 clientele is not acknowledged on American or European runways.\n\nConservative Muslim women account for $266 billion (yes, BILLION) of the global clothing and footwear business. As a model, I worked very closely with designers who, in the \u201990s, did private showings after the main press presentations, offering to lengthen skirts and create matching hijabs for distribution to conservative Muslim clients. Never would you have seen a hijab-wearing model on the runways, until Dolce & Gabbana broke that barrier back in 2016. Now beautiful models with conservative beliefs are taking their turn and their respect as they walk the runways.\n\nMax Mara Fall/Winter 2018 (Catwalking/Getty Images) Max Mara Fall/Winter 2018 (Catwalking/Getty Images) Max Mara Fall/Winter 2018 (Catwalking/Getty Images) Max Mara Fall/Winter 2018 (Catwalking/Getty Images) Max Mara Fall/Winter 2018 (Catwalking/Getty Images) 1 / 5\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs I said, I like the moment we\u2019re in right now: a movement toward inclusion, and celebrating power on the runways.

Sitting there in the theater, gazing up at the gorgeous Dora Milaje, the thought occurred to you at least once: Could I pull off a bald head?\n\nPhoto: Marvel Studios/Disney\n\nMaybe your answer was an immediate and unequivocal \u201cNo,\u201d but if there was even a glimmer of curiosity, let\u2019s dig into it. While women have been rocking baldies and fades for centuries now, our hair is often still considered our \u201ccrowning glory.\u201d But is the crown really what\u2019s on your head, or what\u2019s in it?\n\nWith the ongoing popularity of Marvel\u2019s Black Panther, we got not only an eyeful of epic black excellence and battle scenes, but also a bevy of bald beauties, courtesy of Wakanda\u2019s royal guard, the Dora Milaje, led by General Okoye (played by Danai Gurira), who sports not only a clean-shaven head but a tattooed one.\n\nMuch to our delight, long after shooting wrapped, Gurira continued to have fun with the look in real life; even taking to having designs etched into her reverse bald fade, which she rocked to glamorous effect at the Black Panther European premiere.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Gareth Cattermole (Getty Images for Disney)\n\nBut for those of us who aren\u2019t starring in the latest Hollywood blockbuster, is this a look we can realistically pull off? To find out, we reached out to one of our favorite bald beauties, psychiatrist and occasional contributor to The Root, Dr. Imani J. Walker.\n\n\n\nWalker began shaving her head at about the age of 17 while an incoming freshman at Xavier University in New Orleans. Originally arriving at school with the popular \u201990s-era permed-and-cropped cut made famous by Halle Berry, Walker tells The Glow Up that she quickly found the need for a drastic change:\n\nSo, I got down to New Orleans, and it was like 90-something degrees and 120 percent humidity, and my hair was just\u2014I was like, \u201cThis isn\u2019t happening. I\u2019m not looking cute right now.\u201d And then, my roommate at the time, when we met, we had the exact same haircut. And I was like, OK; out of necessity and also because I just hate doing what everybody else is doing, I just cut it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat \u201cbig chop\u201d led to what has become Walker\u2019s trademark look for the past 25 years, a gleaming bald head she shaves every other day. A very active mom and wife on top of her duties as a doctor, she credits her choice of hairstyle\u2014or lack thereof\u2014with making her busy lifestyle simpler.\n\nI\u2019m fairly active\u2014I work out a good six, if not seven, days a week. So one of the things I really love about it is the fact that it\u2019s not, there\u2019s not anything that I have to really be concerned about ... but also on top of that, [if I\u2019m] jumping in the pool, or I\u2019m the middle of the street and the wind blows, it feels really just nice. It\u2019s just a really refreshing feeling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWalker also admits to us that her personal affinity for baldness is as psychological as it is physical:\n\n\n\nI guess, spiritually speaking, I\u2019ve always felt the need [for] my thoughts to be as close to the air as possible; I just need to feel like I have freedom of thought. And for me, that physically just means having the freedom to be able to have my scalp exposed to as many elements possible. But I think more than anything, I like the way it feels, and it just so happens to look good.\n\nBut Walker warns that while lower maintenance, choosing to go bald doesn\u2019t mean no maintenance. She indulges in a strict skin and scalp regimen to keep her look smooth and free of razor bumps, emphasizing that \u201cyou have to give it as much thought as you would give any type of hairstyle.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow does she keep her dome glowing? By taking extreme care with the tools and products she uses. \u201cYou can\u2019t just take Barbasol shaving cream or some plastic cheap razor and just go to your head; you\u2019ll destroy your scalp,\u201d she warns. \u201cYou\u2019ll have razor bumps forever, and it\u2019s not going to be cute.\u201d\n\nTo keep her close shave extra-cute, Walker has her routine down to a science:\n\nFirst, using a barber-grade Wahl trimmer, like the GroomsMan T-Pro, specially made to give a bump-free shave, Walker shaves her entire head.\n\n\n\nNext, she goes over her head with a set of clippers\u2014she likes Wahl\u2019s Ultra Close Cut Pro, crafted specifically for close shaves but less likely to cause razor bumps. While, technically, she has a very close shave, Walker says, \u201cTo the naked eye, it looks like my head is shining.\u201d\n\nAfter shaving, Walker oil cleanses her scalp, stressing that she treats her scalp the way she treats her face, first applying an oil cleanser that she wipes off with a hot washcloth, followed by a turmeric mask to her face and scalp, which helps to decrease inflammation, and does double duty against pimples and razor bumps. Walker\u2019s homemade mask includes turmeric powder, yogurt, rosewater and lemon juice.\n\nOnce out the shower, she applies a toner with salicylic acid, which she says is \u201cvery exciting in a tingling, like, \u2018Oh my God,\u2019 kind of a way\u2014but the tingle at least lets me know that it works!\u201d Afterward, she recommends using a hydrocortisone or steroid cream on the scalp to help nip any inflammation or razor bumps in the bud.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWalker follows this regimen religiously, shaving only every other day to cut down on irritation and get the best results.\n\nBut while Walker absolutely loves her look, she admits that she\u2019s used to getting stares from those who are unaccustomed to seeing a bald woman, which is why it was so refreshing to see the similarly styled Dora Milaje on-screen.\n\n\u201cI went to go see the movie with my son, and we talked a little bit about it after the movie, and he was like, \u2018Well, yeah, it\u2019s like an army of my mom. This is great ... it\u2019s like having my mom, but, like, 10 of them. This is amazing.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd for those who think a woman going bald compromises her femininity, the doctor has this to say:\n\nFemininity to a lot of people equates with being soft. Femininity to me is the ability to have the option to be soft\u2014the option to be whatever you want\u2014but more importantly, it\u2019s to be a woman and powerful. So I feel very feminine with my head shaved ... I\u2019d feel less feminine if I wore a wig or if my bald head were not on display every day. This is my head. I do what I want to do with it. And if they don\u2019t like it, that\u2019s not really my problem. ... But anybody who doesn\u2019t feel that this look is feminine, I think, needs to really re-evaluate what their insecurities are, and why they would feel the need to place their insecurities on someone else.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd because Walker isn\u2019t the only bald baddie in our midst, we did a little roundup of a few of our other favorite beauties who\u2019ve dared to go bare\u2014or, at least, almost there.\n\nFlorence Kasumba attends the European premiere of Black Panther in London Feb. 8, 2018.

In November, she launched her fashion line, Daya by Zendaya, which is available online, including at Nordstrom.com.\n\nAmid all her career success, Zendaya has made a name for herself in speaking up about race, body image and beauty standards. In 2015, she told Giuliana Rancic that black hair is \u201cgood enough.\u201d She clapped back against racist Twitter trolls who think Spider-Man\u2019s Mary Jane is only a red-headed, white girl. And it\u2019s not always just about clapping back, but also about paying it forward. In January, after an internet troll body-shamed a woman on Twitter, Zendaya offered the plus-size woman a modeling gig with her new line.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c[Acting] has been my passion,\u201d she told Glamour. \u201cBut as I\u2019ve started to understand the power and influence I have, I\u2019ve realized it\u2019s really this avenue for me to do bigger, more meaningful things.

But perhaps CoverGirl\u2019s latest ad, featuring model Amy Deanna, who has vitiligo, is the cosmetic company\u2019s freshest yet. In it, CoverGirl takes an unconventional turn by not trying to cover up Deanna\u2019s skin but, rather, enhancing its uniqueness.\n\nIn the 15-second spot, Deanna applies two shades of CoverGirl\u2019s truBlend foundation to match her contrasting skin tones. Choosing to cover some spots while matching others, she asks, \u201cWhy try to blend in when you can choose to stand out?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a refreshing take on a condition that reportedly affects about 1-2 percent of the population and has only in recent years begun to receive positive attention. In 2014, Canadian model Winnie Harlow was the first contestant with vitiligo to be featured on America\u2019s Next Top Model, in the show\u2019s 21st cycle. Harlow has since become a regular on the the fashion circuit, but only after years of bullying led to her dropping out of high school and contemplating suicide.\n\nCoverGirl isn\u2019t the first cosmetics brand to include a model with vitiligo; Dermablend also includes models with the condition in its tutorials, most notably in the 2014 \u201cCamo Confessions\u201d campaign. But truBlend is perhaps the first foundation line to keep the emphasis on enhancing the beauty that\u2019s already there, rather than covering up to conform. It\u2019s a pretty major move for a beauty brand, and CoverGirl deserves kudos for challenging us to continue to expand the definition of what beauty truly is.", "keywords": ["rare", "trublend", "harlow", "model", "covergirls", "newest", "deanna", "beauty", "highlights", "iamwhatimakeup", "foundation", "ad", "enhancing", "skin", "vitiligo"], "polarity": 0.22113636363636363, "subjectivity": 0.5413154960981048},

Averaging around 600,000 views per post, her funny and frank videos, like \u201cBougie and Bad on a Budget\u201d and \u201cEdges Slaughtered,\u201d bring the real on the makeup tip, touching on issues of race and money in ways that make viewers laugh as much as they learn.\n\nThe Glow Up caught up with Aina a few days after she made history as the first social media star to receive the coveted NAACP Image Award. She told us:\n\nTen years ago, when I started my YouTube channel, it was hard for me to find darker-skinned black women that did makeup the way I like to. I was used to hearing that things \u201cdon\u2019t look good on you\u201d or \u201cyou can\u2019t wear that kind of makeup.\u201d I struggled with being a woman who\u2014people see you with makeup on and dressed nicely, people assume \u201cshe doesn\u2019t work very hard because she doesn\u2019t have to\u201d; [it] made being taken seriously a struggle.\n\nObviously, as a member of the U.S. Army Reserve, Aina is no stranger to hard work. She said that \u201cwomen who enjoy makeup and feeling good, there\u2019s often a lot more to it,\u201d citing the example of women recovering from cancer learning to put their eyebrows back on, or women in uniform, like herself, who want to assert their individuality.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a double minority as a black woman, so I fight through a lot in that regard,\u201d she said. As a woman in the military, \u201cpeople think we\u2019re tomboys or slobs; they say, \u2018You\u2019re too pretty; how could you be in the Army? Whatever that means.\u201d\n\nDuring our conversation, the question Aina seemed to be wrestling with is why women\u2019s motives and values are in question when they want to be at their most presentable: \u201cThe message I want to get across is that whether you want to wear makeup or not, it\u2019s OK to go the extra mile to look your best.\u201d Passion mounted in her voice as she said that she never wants stereotypes about women in uniform \u201cto overshadow the fact that some of us are artistic and creative; we are multifaceted\u2014wearing lipstick and lashes doesn\u2019t make us any less hard workers.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Aina, being beautifully turned out represents \u201cbeing knowledgeable; people come to me for help, and I know I\u2019m good at it.\u201d She pointed to prejudices surrounding beauty, like the now defunct \u201cTake Her Swimming on the First Date\u201d memes, where men were urged to take their date for a dip in order to remove the mask of makeup and discover how truly attractive or unattractive she really is. Aina said:\n\nI don\u2019t think people realize that women genuinely enjoy it. I can go all up and down Instagram and see women with murals literally painted on their faces. Obviously, it\u2019s not ideal for work, but it\u2019s about the fact that we\u2019ve gone way beyond thinking of makeup as a way to hide or to cover up. It\u2019s a form of expression for not only me but a lot of people.\n\nBeing a black person pioneering in any business\u2014Aina has been a vlogger for more than a decade now\u2014has its perks. If you\u2019re good, being first to market can mean not only capturing market share but also defining the category, as she has done. But outliers like Aina also face challenges. In a post called \u201cI Don\u2019t See Color,\u201d she explores questions of race through the lens of the beauty business. She tells us:\n\nI\u2019m not ... just a black beauty blogger. I have dark skin and that shapes my experiences. Being that I\u2019m an African blogger who considers herself Nigerian first\u2014my mother is African American and my dad is Nigerian\u2014I never kind of feel African enough or Nigerian enough. I never know where I kind of fit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s a struggle that most blacks in this country feel on some level every day: that our black cards could be revoked by anyone for not achieving the impossible task of representing the entire black experience as just one person. Aina said:\n\nOne thing that I\u2019ve brought a lot of attention to on my YouTube channel, if you are racially ambiguous\u2014like you skew Asian\u2014it can be a lot easier. When people see more than black, they see mass-market appeal, [and] are more willing to give you a chance. People look at me, and they only see black. It means that people think my content isn\u2019t enjoyable to people who don\u2019t have the same color skin as I do. When it comes to buying foundation and cultural experiences, we want someone who we can relate to ... but I bet that people who won\u2019t give people who look like me a chance on YouTube have pretty homogeneous social and professional circles, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAina urges us \u201cto switch it up and be supportive of other people of color in our industry\u2014[they] can be Latin or Indian, and I enjoy their content.\u201d To this end, she actively seeks out other vloggers who are the polar opposite, not only of her skin color and skin type\u2014Aina has oily skin and can advise women of all skin types\u2014but also to learn what\u2019s on the market and to get further inspiration about what makes women feel beautiful.\n\nIn February 2018, Aina received an NAACP Image Award, the first social media star to hold the honor. She told us: \u201cYou know, I never thought that social change could come about through makeup. All I want to do is enrich the lives of other people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is an acknowledgment that this makeup artist\u2014whose collaborations include becoming a Global United Nations change ambassador in partnership with YouTube, and a line of makeup highlighters with Artists Couture Cosmetics\u2014counts as \u201cthe most important thing that\u2019s happened to me and honors all the creators out there that are often overlooked.\u201d\n\nIn her role as a U.N. change ambassador, Aina\u2019s mission is twofold: to close the gender pay gap and to reach out to people and make them feel seen \u201cso that the way they see themselves changes the world sees them.\u201d\n\nJackie Aina, we definitely see you.", "keywords": ["style", "youtube", "aina", "makeup", "black", "women", "warrior", "skin", "lot", "way", "look", "social", "jackie"], "polarity": 0.13574263038548753, "subjectivity": 0.4877267573696145},

When I quickly glanced into the serving tray to see if, perhaps, this single peppered breast was rogue, an anomaly that managed to escape from his appropriately seasoned brethren, I saw that the pepper-speck-to-breast ratio in the entire tray was perhaps 1.002 to 1.\n\nAnd just to make sure it wasn\u2019t a mistake\u2014maybe someone mixed up the labels and the \u201cseasoned breasts\u201d were really the \u201cplain breasts\u201d\u2014I looked in the plain chicken breast tray. And they were, in fact, so devoid of pepper that a pepper-based tumbleweed brisked past me. Disappointed and disgusted, I put the breast back and just filled my plate with Jello.\n\nJust two weeks ago, I saw two women in a coffee shop with identical bark-brown Patagonia pullovers standing in front of me in line. Apparently they\u2019d met each other that morning at a march, saw that they were wearing the exact same pullover, both thought it was the funniest thing ever, struck up a conversation, learned they lived on the same block and walked together to the coffee shop.

On the 19-level scale of caucasity, it scores a whopping 16! It puts an even whiter spin on the already aggressively white avocado toast, which is like Tomi Lahren using skin-bleaching cream. It somehow includes kale, which is both an insane and insanely obvious ingredient. It was even created in Boston by a person named \u201cRyan.\u201d\n\nThe only thing keeping it from the pinnacle is that nothing was colonized in its creation.

That led to meeting Eileen Ford, the legendary owner of Ford Models. At our first meeting, Eileen pinched my upper arm and said, \u201cLose 5 pounds,\u201d which I did!\n\nTGU: Did you get the sense that you were Ford\u2019s \u201cblack girl\u201d?\n\nDMR: In 1967, agents were trying to find models who were \u201cacceptable\u201d to clients who didn\u2019t really want to book black models. It was the light-skinned models, like Jolie [Jones, music producer Quincy Jones\u2019 eldest daughter] and I, who were considered acceptable. They said, \u201cOK, we can have a black girl because she\u2019s not too black!\u201d But, finally, we got Beverly Johnson, who was dark-skinned and beautiful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: You were a full-time model and a full-time student?\n\n\n\nDMR: Yes, sir! Right away, I was working for Glamour and Mademoiselle. I didn\u2019t know you couldn\u2019t do both!\n\n\n\nTGU: Tell me about becoming Northwestern University\u2019s first African-American homecoming queen.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDMR: It was uncomfortable. It was unexpected, and it was disrespected. At the time, I promised Northwestern they would never hear from me again.\n\nFour Caucasian sorority girls were elected to Homecoming Court, but not as the queen. One of them cried her little eyes out. When they called my name, the president of the university looked at me, held the crown over my head and said, \u201cI have to stand here while they take pictures,\u201d then turned and walked away.\n\nBackstage, while the court was introduced, one by one, the girls would go out and you would hear applause from the audience. Then \u201cDaphne\u201d was introduced \u2026 silence. So I hiked up my dress, walked across the stage, said, \u201cThank you,\u201d and went on about my business. At the homecoming football game, they gave me a little cup that didn\u2019t even have my name on it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, it was a blast. Jet magazine, Amsterdam News and press from all over the world had gotten hold of the story. My community\u2014the black community\u2014celebrated. I wasn\u2019t in the yearbook as homecoming queen because the administration told me it \u201cwasn\u2019t important.\u201d Forty years later, the Black Alumni Association gave me a Hall of Fame Award. The current university president apologized, asked me to crown the new homecoming queen and to join the advisory board.\n\nDaphne Maxwell is crowned homecoming queen of Northwestern University in 1967.

The photographer had me sit on a windowsill and smile. I was done in 15 minutes. A month-and-a-half later, I was walking by a newsstand and saw myself! No one told me that booking was for Glamour or I\u2019d made the cover. It\u2019s my most enduring photo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut there was another shoot that is my favorite.

When did you become so racist?\n\nIt was when I was 17: The Pittsburgh Zoo made this big stink about getting a polar bear\u2014press releases and parties and polar-bear-themed brunches and shit\u2014despite the fact that they already had perfectly fine (and strikingly handsome) black and brown bears. I saw that as a metaphor for America, and I pledged to never let this country black-and-brown-bear me.\n\nSo, again, why do you hate white people?\n\nI don\u2019t hate white people.\n\nBut you\u2019re a racist.\n\nIf black people could be racist, I would be. But we can\u2019t, so I\u2019m not.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t make any sense.\n\nIt does. It doesn\u2019t have to. But it does.\n\nMoving on ... so you live in Pittsburgh, right?\n\nYes.\n\nAnd you attended a mixed-race high school and a predominantly white college?\n\nCorrect.\n\nHow does one live that life and never have any white friends?\n\nOh, I\u2019ve definitely had white friends. I had a white kid at the birthday slumber party I had when I was 10, and (at least) two of my white teammates in college were friends. Just right now, in 2018, I don\u2019t happen to have any.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Courtesy of Damon Young\n\nSo you\u2019re not cool with any white people at all?\n\nI wouldn\u2019t say that either. There\u2019s a group of guys I\u2019ve been playing basketball with once a week for a decade. Most of them are white, and I\u2019m quite friendly with many of them. Some I\u2019d even call homies. As in, \u201cJohn\u2019s the white homie. He cool.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are also the dozens of white people I see on a regular basis in coffee shops and at the Ace Hotel (where I do much of my work) and in my neighborhood. These are people I speak to regularly. Some I like more than others, but that\u2019s true for everyone, I guess.\n\nThese sound like friends.\n\nMaybe they do to you. But there\u2019s a difference between a friend and someone you happen to like and happen to be very friendly with. For instance, there are maybe 20 people I interact with on a regular basis through text, email, Google Hangouts, Slack and Facebook. With many of these people, I have the types of private conversations and share the types of inside jokes that would either be too irrelevant or too inappropriate to share publicly. The insularity of these interactions is trusting, connecting and intentional.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese are some of the people I consider friends, and none of them are white. It\u2019s not that I\u2019ve intentionally barred white people from friendship\u2014just that, considering my friendship criteria, none right now would qualify.\n\nAnd just so you don\u2019t think it\u2019s just me\u2014that there are white people out there who consider me a friend but it\u2019s just not reciprocated\u2014I\u2019ve been invited to maybe 20 weddings in the last five years. Do you want to guess how many of those invitations were from white people?\n\nZero?\n\nActually, two. But these were from white people who happen to be friends with my wife.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, I will say that there is one white person who was at my wedding and has also been to my house within the last year to eat garlic-parm chicken wings and talk shit about white people\u2014a standard requirement of friendship for me. But while I do consider her a friend, she was my wife\u2019s friend first, and I\u2019m not a friend pirate, so I\u2019m not going to claim friend dibs on her.\n\nDon\u2019t you think there\u2019s something wrong with this?\n\nNot at all! And if you look at the statistics, this is perfectly normal. Less than 10 percent of the average black person\u2019s friends are white\u2014and I think that number is a little high\u2014and the average white person has exactly one black friend (which also happens to be the character Rashida Jones plays in every movie she\u2019s in).\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut shouldn\u2019t whites and blacks be friends with each other if we want to solve racism?\n\nEh. Racism is too ingrained and complex for a few wedding invitations and GroupMe conversations to solve it. We haven\u2019t even solved Tupac\u2019s murder yet, and he was killed in front of 34,374,984 witnesses. How the fuck are we gonna solve racism?\n\nOn an individual level, though, interracial friendship is great if it happens organically, but racial empathy and kindness are more important. And empathy and kindness can (and should) exist without friendship. I mean, I watched this Netflix documentary on humpback whales the other day, and I\u2019m very empathetic to their plight. But I ain\u2019t gonna invite one to game night.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnything else you wish to add?\n\n#AllBearsMatter.", "keywords": ["white", "dont", "im", "friend", "friends", "friendship", "black", "think", "happen", "explained", "hate"], "polarity": 0.005082810447978984, "subjectivity": 0.3468960159690496},

DeVos took only a handful of questions at a news conference afterward, not getting into specific details about the visit or what policy proposals she would consider to curb gun violence.\n\nThis sounds pretty damn useless.\n\nMany of the students, some of whom have become activists for gun control in the wake of the shooting, said on social media that DeVos didn\u2019t meet with many students and \u201cbarely\u201d responded to their questions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUseless AF.\n\nCarly Novell, an editor at the student newspaper, the Eagle Eye, said that even student publications were restricted from interacting with DeVos and that \u201cno one followed her.\u201d\n\nUseless infinity.\n\nAnna Fusco, Broward Teachers Union president, who was present during DeVos\u2019 visit, confirmed the students\u2019 accounts, telling HuffPost that \u201cthey didn\u2019t see the purpose of her being there.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThai-style fried rice with shrimp and useless.\n\nTo be fair, DeVos\u2019 entire steez is just one relentless spritz of uselessness.

I\u2019m almost 40 years old, which means that I grew up in the \u201980s and \u201990s listening to Common (n\u00e9e Lonnie Rashid Lynn Jr.) when he was rapping about watermelons and communism and asking to borrow a dollar. I still own a copy of his classic album Resurrection, which has his name listed as Common Sense\u2014you know, before the lawsuit that had him change his name to Common.\n\nThe Common I see today is a far cry from the rapper Common (Sense) that used to be part of hip-hop great debates; his GOAT potential was always on the table. His One Day It\u2019ll All Make Sense (my God, \u201cInvocation\u201d is perfect) and Like Water for Chocolate albums are indisputable classics. Be is a classic Kanye album (seriously, Kanye had the most memorable verse on the entire record, and the intro song \u201cBe\u201d is easily one of Kanye\u2019s best beats of all time\u2014fight me, bro).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Common from the \u201990s was still beefing with all comers\u2014remember, this is the nigga who beefed with Ice Cube in his prime and Louis Farrakhan intervened, and who also took shots at both Hype Williams AND Puffy at their height on the Roots\u2019 \u201cAct Too (Love of My Life)\u201d from 1999\u2019s Things Fall Apart album. Com Sense from the City of Wind was Chicago\u2019s answer to Nas, a street poet who participated in the culture he was helping to curate in real time. He was part of the Soulquarians collective, pushing the genre forward artistically.\n\nAnd then shit changed. Common went from being a rapper\u2019s rapper to \u201cGlory,\u201d a rap song for white people who read Ta-Nehisi Coates books. His albums weren\u2019t bad, per se, but his verses were less biting, less edgy, less memorable and more generally vague mixed with corny attempts at crossover success. Gone was the social commentary in favor of comments to Jon Stewart on The Daily Show in 2015 like this, via HuffPost:\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019ve been bullied, we\u2019ve been beat down and we don\u2019t want it anymore. We are not extending a fist and we are not saying, \u2018You did us wrong.\u2019 It\u2019s more like, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m extending my hand in love,\u2019\u201d he said to host Jon Stewart. \u201cLet\u2019s forget about the past as much as we can and let\u2019s move from where we are now. How can we help each other? Can you try to help us because we are going to try to help ourselves, too.\u201d \u201cMe as a black man, I\u2019m not sitting there like, \u2018Hey, white people, y\u2019all did us wrong.\u2019 We know that existed,\u201d Common said. \u201cI don\u2019t even have to keep bringing that up. It\u2019s like being in a relationship and continuing to bring up the person\u2019s issues. Now I\u2019m saying, \u2018Hey, I love you. Let\u2019s move past this. Come on, baby, let\u2019s get past this.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, one could say that Common somehow stumbled into the sunken place, but that\u2019s not accurate at all. Assuming that the sunken place has something to do with access to or dating white women, that\u2019s not Common\u2019s ministry, for the most part. He\u2019s been linked with Taraji P. Henson, Serena Williams, Kerry Washington and, of course, the original knit-pants-procurement specialist, Erykah Badu. So what the hell happened? How does one of the most aggressive rappers whose entire M.O. was keepin\u2019 it real become hip-hop for white people?\n\nSimple. He secured the bag. And he found out what rappers who make a transition ALL say: Rap checks ain\u2019t shit compared with movie, television, commercial and \u201cWhite people love me\u201d checks. Common made it into television and movies, and even as a struggle actor in Wanted and Smokin\u2019 Aces, and an entirely unbelievable role as an NBA superstar in Just Wright opposite Queen Latifah\u2014another ultimate bag securer\u2014he was likely clearing more per film than most of his album royalty checks.\n\nThis man went from \u201cCom, I make righteous bitches get low\u201d to performing poetry at the White House to doing NPR Tiny Desks to winning an Oscar and several Grammys. He was a Gap model. He\u2019s in Microsoft commercials as the damn voice of Microsoft. Common figured out how to secure the fuck out of the bag, and his rapping suffered for taking a backseat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be clear, I don\u2019t think any of this is negative. At least not for him. Common might not be a very good rapper at this point, but hell\u2014he used to be hungry. This nigga is eating now. A lot. When he wants to and where he wants. He went from British Knights to Balenciaga. When your drive as a rapper is largely tied to being underappreciated, lack of respect or anger at society, better circumstances and access to money and resources change shit. Then the angst subsides. It\u2019s hard to stay mad in Ferragamo slippers and sippin\u2019 Dom Perignon, or at least not that White Star!\n\nIn fact, I\u2019ll bet Common laughs to the bank (or more likely laughs when direct deposit hits) every time he thinks about where he started and where he is now. He has made the absolute most of the hip-hop game. Folks reach out to him to do songs for major motion pictures that end up nominated for Academy Awards for the most vapid, boring, black-music-for-white-people bullshit (like \u201cStand Up for Something,\u201d with Andra Day, which might as well have been called \u201cGlory-er\u201d), and they cut big checks.\n\nHell, I\u2019m wondering if he even tries anymore, and he still secures the bag every time. His latest album, Black America Again, even missed the mark despite its supreme timeliness. There were some familiar flashes of brilliance and very solid production. It just didn\u2019t have ... it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPretty much, he\u2019s dad rap now\u2014he is a father\u2014but he still has all the respect of the hip-hop community for past achievements in the inner-city hip-hop arts. White people can look at Common and say, \u201cI like that Common; \u2018Glory\u2019 was so moving and inspirational and really made me rethink that hippety-hop,\u201d and the rest of us just say, \u201cI mean, it\u2019s good to see him rich and shit, and at least we got Like Water for Chocolate.\u201d Common is out here being the change he wants to see.

There are dozens of contenders, but none that have ever truly stuck. Basically, the search for the perfect slur for white people has been like the search for a really good fast-food fish sandwich.\n\n\u201cCracker\u201d is perhaps the most famous one, as it\u2019s been around so long that there are popular modifications to it, most notably \u201ccracka\u201d and the sublime \u201ccracka-ass cracka.\u201d But these feel too retrograde, like one of those insults that seemed old even when it was young. It\u2019s the Morgan Freeman of slurs. \u201cHonky\u201d is corny and stupid, and \u201credneck\u201d and \u201cwhite trash\u201d are both classist and allow white people to be intraracially classist.\n\nRecently, quite a few punny attempts at finding the perfect insult have been created\u2014most notably, \u201cwypipo\u201d and \u201cDwight.\u201d But these might be too \u201cclever.\u201d Too\u2014dare I say it\u2014millennial. Plus, what\u2019s the point of a slur if the people you\u2019re slurring don\u2019t even realize it\u2019s a slur? That\u2019s a waste of a slur! Slur wasting is a sin!\n\nSearching for a slur for white people seemed, well, useless. But in the week following the release of Black Panther, a new contender emerged\u2014one that smashes historical reverence and contemporary snark and pith together into a tasty slur sangria: \u201ccolonizer\u201d!\n\nNow, \u201ccolonizer\u201d isn\u2019t a perfect slur. It doesn\u2019t quite roll off the tongue. Plus, it has four syllables, and all of the best slurs have two or fewer. And it requires at least a superficial understanding of world history to understand the context. The best slurs should work even if you slept through social studies, or if you\u2019re like me and you (mostly) stayed awake in class but didn\u2019t quite know what colonization meant until you read a very illuminating Twitter thread on it in 2011.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost importantly, slurs derive their power from power. The main reason slurs for white Americans don\u2019t quite stick or pack much of a punch is that they still wield most of the power here. Slurs are meant to shame and induce claustrophobia\u2014a sense of perpetual unwelcome. But how unwelcoming can a word be if your status exists as a boundless welcome mat? Colonizer, however, recognizes that dynamic and inverts it by laughing at it instead of lauding it. It\u2019s a Jedi slur trick.\n\nPerhaps \u201ccolonizer\u201d won\u2019t catch. But I think we should give it a test drive for the next three months to see how it rides. And if that doesn\u2019t work, we can always go back to the lab. And who knows? Maybe a new contender will emerge. Personally, I\u2019ve always thought \u201cmayonnaise boy\u201d had potential.

But as she tells Allure in its March issue, her own journey to choosing to wear her hair in its natural state was a very different one from the almost instantaneous success she enjoyed after being cast in her Oscar-winning role in 12 Years a Slave.\n\nAs a tween in Kenya, Nyong\u2019o was teased and felt \u201creally unpretty\u201d in comparison with her classmates\u2014who almost all wore their hair relaxed. Her mother wanted her to wait until near adulthood to relax her hair but eventually acquiesced to her daughter\u2019s pleas. Nyong\u2019o explains:\n\nShe took me to the salon in the middle of the school day, and I got my hair relaxed. I felt so much better because it was easier to tame. All the girls in my class had their hair relaxed. Very few had natural kink, so I felt a lot more acceptable. I had my hair relaxed for most of my teenage years, and that was a whole other world. The upkeep of relaxed hair is a commitment. It took styling it once a week and then having it retouched once a month. I remember doing crazy things, like sleeping with my head above the headboard so that my curls wouldn\u2019t get messed up for the next day. I\u2019d have these terrible neck aches because I was determined to keep my hair as pristine as possible. And it was super expensive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, Nyongo\u2019s conversion back to natural hair began in response to a joke from her father while she was asking him for money to support her relaxer habit: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just cut it all off?\u201d he said. She did, having her head shaved completely bald, a choice that she told Allure was \u201cliberating.\u201d\n\nBut the choice wasn\u2019t a cure-all; Nyong\u2019o struggled with managing her texture for years, especially after moving to the northeastern United States for college and graduate school:\n\nMoving to the U.S. was very difficult because I didn\u2019t have the same kind of support system. [Braiding] services were not readily available in Amherst, Massachusetts. For a long time I would braid my hair in Kenya and then spend months with the braids in when I got to the States so that I didn\u2019t have to worry about my hair. Also, my hair did something very different in freezing weather, which I didn\u2019t know how to handle. My hair needs moisture. It needs warmth. All of a sudden I was in this very cold environment, and my hair was bristly and dry and really hard to manage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd while it was Nyong\u2019o\u2019s work with famed stylist Ted Gibson that got many inspired about the versatility of natural hair, it was her current stylist, Vernon Franc\u0327ois, who helped her learn how to manage and care for her natural texture, thanks in large part to his eponymous line of products/ (Franc\u0327ois also provided some insight and tips on how he created the looks for Nyong\u2019o\u2019s Allure cover shoot.)\n\nNyong\u2019o says:\n\n\n\nOne thing I\u2019ve learned was the acronym LOC, and that\u2019s basically the rule for how to treat my hair: liquid, oil, and then cream. It\u2019s the idea that you wet your hair first, then you add oil so that it can trap the moisture in, then you put a moisturizer or a cream over it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNyong\u2019o says that this is the longest her hair has been in a decade. And while we\u2019re guessing that a few extras were added to create the cloudlike coifs she rocks in Allure\u2019s March issue, we\u2019re liking the look on her.

These are historical statements from yesteryear describing a despised race of people in America. They are indicative of the sentiment of white people throughout this country who thought a subhuman species good for nothing but work and servitude might ruin America with their crime, poverty and interbreeding with white women. They were not referring to Africans, Mexicans or Muslims.\n\nThey were talking about the Irish.\n\nFirst, we should get this out of the way: One of the favorite recurring themes of racists in America is the idea that the Irish came to America as slaves and had it as bad as, or worse than, Africans. According to these \u201cracialists,\u201d the European blood in the Irish made them pull themselves up by their bootstraps and integrate themselves into the opening arms of American liberty. They never bitched and moaned about their situation, so ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll of this is wrong. In fact, it is too stupid to give space, credence or words, so read where it is debunked here and here.\n\nBut as we celebrate the first St. Patrick\u2019s Day of the Trumpian era, we should remember when America passed laws against another group of immigrants. We should recall when this country tried to ban another group of people based on their religion. We should never forget that both \u201cAmerican\u201d and whiteness are sociopolitical constructs that have evolved over a long period of time, always seeking exclusion and supremacy, and it was not so long ago that Irish Americans were on the outside looking in.\n\nIn his book The Renegade History of the United States, Thaddeus Russell explains that the first large wave of Irish immigrants worked low-paying jobs\u2014mostly building the canals along the Canadian border\u2014that other Americans wouldn\u2019t do. Like finding out a song you thought was new is actually a 100-year-old remake, the Irish were simultaneously accused of stealing all the good jobs and branded as \u201clazy\u201d and \u201cshiftless.\u201d They were also thought to be the nonwhite \u201cmissing link\u201d between the superior European and the savage African based on stereotypes from the early American media, according to the Boston Globe:\n\nIn the popular press, the Irish were depicted as subhuman. They were carriers of disease. They were drawn as lazy, clannish, unclean, drunken brawlers who wallowed in crime and bred like rats. Most disturbingly, the Irish were Roman Catholics coming to an overwhelmingly Protestant nation and their devotion to the pope made their allegiance to the United States suspect.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1798, Congress passed three \u201cAlien Acts\u201d based mainly on fears of Irish-Catholic, anti-immigrant sentiment. These new laws gave the president the power to stop immigration from any country at war with the U.S. and the right to deport any immigrant, and made it harder for immigrants to vote. Then, again in the late 1840s, a nationalist political group called the Know-Nothings sprang from a populist movement of poor whites who were dissatisfied with the two-party system and started the American Party, intent on preserving America\u2019s culture by restricting immigration, especially from Catholic countries\u2014including by Irish Catholics. They managed to get candidates elected into the highest political offices in America, including a president.\n\nDoes this sound familiar to anyone?\n\nSo how did the Irish become white?\n\nRussell suggests they did it by coalescing their political power while simultaneously assimilating into the American mainstream, specifically with jobs in civil service (which is why most cities\u2019 St. Patrick Day parades are ostensibly celebrations of police and fire departments):\n\nIn 1840, at the beginning of the great wave of Irish immigration, there was only a handful of Irish police officers on the force. ... By the end of the year, Irish made up more than one-quarter of the New York City police, and by the end of the century, more than half the city\u2019s police and more than 75 percent of its firefighters were Irish Americans. In addition, Irish were disproportionately represented among prosecutors, judges and prison guards. Soon, the Irish cop was a stock figure in American culture. Once known as apelike barbarians, the Irish were now able to show themselves as the most selfless and patriotic civil servants.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn his book How the Irish Became White, author Noel Ignatiev notes, \u201cWhile the white skin made the Irish eligible for membership in the white race, it did not guarantee their admission; they had to earn it.\u201d Ignatiev and other scholars argue that the sons of Ireland gained their white status by joining the fight against abolition and uniting in the suppression of blacks\u2014embracing the oldest American tradition of them all: racism.\n\n\u201cWhile Irish American repealers maintained a pride and love for their homeland, they acted unabashedly American in the way they dealt with the slavery controversy.\u201d\u2014Angela F. Murphy in American Slavery, Irish Freedom: Abolition, Immigrant Citizenship, and the Transatlantic Movement for Irish Repeal\n\nBut there is a simpler, less complex explanation for how this country eventually came to view the Irish as regular, good, American white people:\n\nThey just did it.\n\n\u201cWhiteness\u201d isn\u2019t real. Ultimately, race is a social construct, and \u201cwhite\u201d is just some dumb shit that people made up a long time ago to build a fence around their idea of self-supremacy. The Irish didn\u2019t suddenly calm down, put down the Guinness, put their noses to the grindstone and work their way into an exclusive club. They had the same historical trajectory in America as the Polish, Italians and Jewish people. Their melanin-less skin just afforded them an opportunity to blend in that black people will never get.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe \u201cgreat white race\u201d is as real as a mermaid riding a unicorn on the back of a dragon while listening to dope lyrics from Lil Uzi, and that\u2019s why white supremacy is so stupid. People who perpetuate that bullshit should be paid the same attention as alt-right advocates, Hoteps, flat-earthers and anyone who owns an Iggy Azalea album.\n\nSo later tonight, as you\u2019re kneeling by the toilet blowing chunks of corned beef and green beer, if you start thinking about how poorly we treat immigrants and how we live in a new era of intolerance and hate, just remember how the Irish became white. Because just like St. Patrick\u2019s Day celebrations, whiteness and racism itself\u2014it\u2019s an American tradition that has existed for a long time.", "keywords": ["white", "country", "werent", "america", "race", "thought", "american", "immigrants", "way", "irish", "long"], "polarity": 0.020402938111271442, "subjectivity": 0.3099209625251292},

I was wrong. In the 150 miles between Pittsburgh and Cumberland, Md., we saw four.\n\nThe dearth of black people on the GAP trail should be no surprise to anyone who\u2019s driven through Pennsylvania. A popular joke about the state is that it\u2019s Pittsburgh on one side, Philadelphia on the other and Alabama in between. The \u201cjoke,\u201d of course, is that once you leave those metropolitan areas, you\u2019re surrounded by small towns and rural farmland. And \u201csurrounded by small towns and rural farmland\u201d is a euphemistic way of saying \u201csurrounded by whiteness.\u201d\n\nThing is, that dynamic isn\u2019t exactly unique to Pennsylvania. Regardless of where you are in the country, once you get 10-15 miles outside a city\u2019s greater metropolitan area, you\u2019re probably going to splash into a sea of white people. And that sea probably won\u2019t end until you\u2019re near another city. It\u2019s so stark that if you had no concept of America and you asked an American where the black people lived, they could just draw a small circle around the 30 largest cities, say \u201cthere\u201d and be mostly accurate. And then, if you asked where the white people lived, they could say, \u201cThere, too. And everywhere else.\u201d\n\nIn America, white people are everywhere, and this ubiquity connects to perhaps our greatest irony: We (black people) are vastly outnumbered by them. They also own more land, earn and possess more money, and have all the guns. Most of the people making laws are white, as are most of the people enforcing them. There are entire states you can drive through without seeing one of us, entire lives that can be led without ever having any meaningful interaction with us. We are surrounded, outnumbered, out-resourced and outgunned. Our entire existence here is a continual assault on our bodies.\n\nBut we are the ones perceived to be the threats. We are the ones they\u2019re scared of. We are the ones who tell our children how to dress and how to wear their hair so they\u2019re not thought of as threats to them. We are the ones who consciously and subconsciously modify our voices and our behavior when forced to interact with them. We\u2019re the ones whom trained officers with weapons and badges and handcuffs and legal justifications are so damn scared of that we\u2019ve created entire curricula based on that fear, teaching ourselves what to do to seem less frightening to them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis fear is why they\u2019re so obsessed with arming themselves with multiple human killing machines. It\u2019s why they fight against even the notion of incremental disarmament so vehemently. They are scared shitless of us. Of anyone who is not them. And this fear is why our shitty gun laws exist, and it\u2019s why they will continue to.\n\nPerhaps this fear is guilt-based, and they\u2019re scared the same way you were as a kid when you stole some cash from your teacher\u2019s purse. And you kept waiting for repercussions, but they just never came. But that fear\u2014that feeling that you\u2019d have to answer for your wrongs eventually\u2014never quite left. Or maybe this fear is karmic. A belief that once we \u201cget on top,\u201d we\u2019ll treat them the way they\u2019ve treated us. And that fear drives them to do whatever they can to maintain their position.\n\nEither way, I doubt we\u2019ll see any movement on guns until they acknowledge this pervasive and delusional and self-destructive collective fear and go to therapy.

Like, Cali Weekend in Atlanta used to have fliers for parties that said, 8pm-Black Folk Start Running Away. Running as a survival mechanism is a thing ingrained in our collective psyche. And sure, Black folks have been among the world\u2019s best sprinters and marathon runners and hurdlers and the like, but that\u2019s also running for a reason. You know, a medal and/or some money.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRunning for fun, however, totally white people shit.\n\nI mean, how you gonna tell Black folks to wake up at 6am on a Saturday, go outside, and run for no goddamn reason other than to get a commemorative t-shirt and maybe come hot chocolate, right? Wrong. Apparently we just got the memo late and now we out here forming groups like Black Girls Run and shit hitting these streets just running for the fuck of it.\n\nWe run now. It\u2019s a thing. For health. I dig it.\n\nRidiculousness with Rob Dyrdek\n\nWhite people don\u2019t know this, but Black folks love watching them get hurt doing shit we\u2019d probably get arrested (or killed) for doing.

One, the man is whiter than the driven snow. I mean, he doesn\u2019t even have lips. Even when Phil was the man, he looked like a chemistry teacher or what would happen if a Chrysler K-Car assumed human form. I also bring him up because the other night I was at a taco joint full of black people in an Irish neighborhood in Chicago (that, by itself, could be a punchline) when \u201cIn the Air Tonight\u201d came on the Pandora and, well, the drum part.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet\u2019s be clear, I don\u2019t care who you are, where you are, what you\u2019re doing, or who you\u2019re doing it with, when the drums kick in on \u201cIn the Air Tonight\u201d you better grab your invisible sticks and bang the fuck out.

And considering their public profile\u2014patriarch LaVar Ball actually got into it with an actual sitting U.S. president\u2014it\u2019s entirely possible that whole communities in places I\u2019ve never been to are walking around geared up on that newest BBB \u2019nalia. If this happened in Iowa or in communities who shoot for proximity to blackness without actual blackness, I would not be surprised. But I really wonder who is doing all of the copping.\n\nIf I think about it, there is one community that I\u2019m entirely sure would be purchasing and wearing BBB clothing. These folks basically just need to know two things: 1) They\u2019re black owned, and 2) where to get it. These are the folks like my father who are actually rooting for everybody black\u2014the same folks who would have voted for Obama no matter what happened short of seeing him snorting a line of cocaine off the ass of a white woman, and even then\u2014if he didn\u2019t shout out his social security number\u2014might still grant him benefit of the doubt.\n\n\n\nOlder black folks are ALWAYS rooting for everybody black. They weren\u2019t voting for anybody BUT Obama, and they keep Tyler Perry in business because he\u2019s black. I remember once I needed to get the airport to fly back to D.C. one Sunday many moons ago. And do you know neither of my parents volunteered to take me? They live in Madison, Ala., a suburb of Huntsville, and there aren\u2019t exactly cabs anywhere, and this was before Uber, which I\u2019m also not sure is even there now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy didn\u2019t they want to take me? Because Tiger Woods was playing. Or Venus or Serena was playing. At this point I honestly don\u2019t remember, but watching black people beat white people at shit is what they live for. If there were a world-champion pingpong player from Detroit making it to television on Sunday afternoons, that\u2019s where they\u2019d be, their son\u2019s need to get home be damned.\n\nIn fact, I\u2019m surprised my father doesn\u2019t have anything from BBB right now, and I\u2019m really only guessing that he doesn\u2019t since you have to order it online and he\u2019d much rather walk into a store and walk out with something in hand than order it and wait. My father is an impatient man when it comes to his support of your blackness. But I\u2019m pretty positive that he\u2019s like so many other folks in our community who are actively supporting any and every cause as long as you tell them it\u2019s black and isn\u2019t anti-Jesus.\n\nOnce you add that to people who will support JUST because it exists, sneakerheads who believe the shoes are an investment of sorts and relationships built with schools or organizations and little white kids who like having that cool new black shit because their parents don\u2019t spend enough time with them and try to make up for it with money, the Balls are ballin\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo maybe LaVar and Lonzo were right in spurning those deals from the bigger companies. Doing it their way seems to be working for Lonzo, at least; how LiAngelo and LaMelo fare is yet to be seen. But there\u2019s more than one way to skin a cat, apparently.\n\nAnd apparently, WAY more of you all have BBB clothing than social media indicates.", "keywords": ["im", "baller", "bbb", "order", "folks", "black", "big", "exactly", "buying", "brand", "ball", "shoes", "lonzo", "products"], "polarity": 0.1099376217094664, "subjectivity": 0.44297832695890943},

For most of my life my fear of failure was so strong, I would not even consider opportunities unless I was confident that I could achieve them.\n\n\n\nSo my time in college was largely defined by taking the safer route, especially avoiding anything that would put me in direct competition with my famous entrepreneurial father. I made choices that I thought were common sense but in retrospect were driven by risk aversion. These choices included not pursuing any student activities related to investing, not running for any leadership role (unless someone else nominated me), and choosing to major in history and literature instead of economics.\n\nFor example, I applied for a postgraduate fellowship for photojournalism instead of writing because I thought it made my application stronger, even though news photography had become less interesting to me.\n\nThey cut me in the final round. I was surprised, having chosen the safer route and expecting it to pay off for me. To think, if I had followed my instincts, my dream and my heart, I might have been able to pursue the writing opportunity I originally wanted, because that\u2019s where my true talent was.\n\n\n\nMy risk aversion even led me to give up on things I was good at. My junior year, I gave up my bimonthly opinion column in the school newspaper. For a year and a half, I had exhausted myself making every essay an original idea. I thought that was what I needed to do to be excellent.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe pressure burned me out. Also, my good friend wanted the slot. Never mind that the dean of the college had invited me to a regular lunch as a result of my column (my topics were campus life and issues of racial justice). Never mind that I had won the column fair and square through a campuswide contest.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou gave up a column?!\u201d said a prospective mentor, a noted female opinion writer, years later. \u201cThat\u2019s crazy.\u201d\n\nVoluntarily giving up a column was so unusual, the dean assumed that I had graduated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am here to tell you about a radical concept that changed my life for the better, and may help you with yours: celebrating failure. My organization, All Star Code, developed it as a foundational part of its curriculum and uses it to empower young men of color to be successful in tech. However, the practice of celebrating failure works for everyone.\n\nWhy Fear of Failure Runs Deep\n\nFor black and brown people, the world trains them to think that they should seem perfect. There is so much evidence of the ways that black students aren\u2019t allowed to fail. According to the 2017 Brown Center Report on Education, in 2015 the statewide African-American suspension rate in California was 17.8 percent, much higher than for other groups. For Latinos, the suspension rate was 5.2 percent; for whites, 4.4 percent; and for Asians, 1.2 percent. Minor infractions and mistakes get big punishments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nParents of black and brown boys often create a \u201cno mistakes\u201d culture. I am thinking of \u201cthe talk,\u201d the script of tightly controlled moves for how to behave around a police officer. It\u2019s tragic, because the freedom to express your emotions should be a basic human right. And while I don\u2019t endorse arguing with police officers, the truth is, that\u2019s the natural thing to do if you\u2019ve been wrongfully arrested; and quite frankly, white people do it all the time.\n\nThe pressure not to fail\u2014not just on the streets (or in a park); heck, to never make a mistake or relax\u2014also exists in school. Too often in our educational systems, the consequences of innocent mischief for our boys and girls can be too harsh.\n\nWhen you engage with a field such as tech, this can be problematic. The goal is to innovate\u2014that is, to have wild ideas and the willingness to try them. But the thing with trying to do something that has never been done before is that you are bound to make mistakes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMistakes are behaviors whose impact is the opposite of what you intended. In other words, things you did wrong (eek, gasp!). In The Lean Startup, Eric Ries describes the build-measure-learn feedback loop in innovation. First you build something, then you try it out, measure (aka, what is working and what isn\u2019t) and then learn from your mistakes (as well as your successes). Based on those assessments, you start building all over again.\n\nCelebrating Failure: How It Works\n\nIn 2014, I was in a circle with my team yelling as loud as we dared, \u201cI have failed!\u201d and then cheering and clapping wildly. It was at the behest of a 23-year-old computer-engineering graduate who had run the country\u2019s largest collegiate hackathon. His name was Jon and I had hired him to develop a curriculum that would expose our students foremost to how to think like an engineer. I picked him because he is one of the most freethinking, interesting people I have ever met.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy general directive was that I wanted the program to \u201copen the world\u201d to our students, who are primarily black and Latino and in high school. Jon told me that the key was to teach them to celebrate failure\u2014hence the exercise, \u201cI have failed.\u201d\n\nI remember doing it, and it felt like a huge release. I loved it. We loved it. And now it is a huge part of the success of my organization, All Star Code.\n\nI founded All Star Code in 2013. We teach computer science to young men of color with the goal of developing a new generation of entrepreneurs who have the tools to be successful in tech. \u201cCelebrating failure\u201d is one of the three pillars of our organization (pdf), and a tool we teach our students. We have even implemented a \u201cfail wall,\u201d where we share our failures and clap for one another in the classroom when a failure is shared. This practice is designed to lower inhibitions and helps counteract this fear of failure, allowing them to experiment and do more. Through this practice, we combat the desire to be perfect.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Freedom to Fail\n\nWhen we say \u201cWe celebrate failure here,\u201d it turbocharges the learning because students start to come forward with their mistakes. At the beginning of the summer, these 16-year-olds walk into the classroom tense and uncertain (the classrooms are inside some of the top companies and colleges in America). Often, they have their baseball hats on. They are reluctant to take off their backpacks, even wearing them while sitting down.\n\nDuring the exercise, it\u2019s important for someone to take the lead in embracing looking ridiculous. Big gestures and yelling loudly are very important: \u201cI HAVE FAILED!\u201d We stand on chairs. We might jump and pump our fists. Going around the circle, you see people calibrate how loud they feel they can allow themselves to be. But after this moment, the whole culture of the classroom transforms.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe \u201cI have failed\u201d exercise transforms their demeanor. Their posture shifts; they start looking each other in the eye. They smile more. They relax. The backpacks and hats come off. They feel freed.\n\nThe culture of tech does not trust anyone who is not comfortable with making mistakes. In planning All Star Code, I interviewed roughly 150 people, including people of color who were executives in tech or tech-enabled companies, and also people of color who were frustrated at their inability to break in.\n\nAnd yet based on my five years of developing a pipeline from high school into college and industry internships for young men of color, I think that one of the biggest obstacles to success for many African Americans and within other communities of color is the fear of failure that has been programmed into us by society. This has led to a reluctance within these communities to admit when you have made a mistake. But this covering up of problems is incompatible with tech\u2019s \u201cfail harder, fail fast\u201d culture and with the mentality that its job is to solve problems. You can\u2019t solve problems if you don\u2019t talk about them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe reason celebrating failure is such a powerful practice for lifelong learning is that it breaks the cycle. It provides the space for one to start talking about, reflecting on and learning from one\u2019s experience. What prevents people from actually learning from failure is the fear of failure itself.\n\nFor Each Failed Try, Clap for Yourself\n\nWith all due respect to Yoda, I think you have to try in order to do.\n\nThe next time you catch yourself obsessing over something that went wrong or worrying about something that could go wrong, try approaching it differently. Take a deep breath, mentally cheer for yourself and celebrate the fact that you are doing something difficult.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter you have felt your stress levels go down, smile, go and talk to someone, and share what you\u2019re struggling with. Believe it or not, that\u2019s the beginning of receiving the help you need.\n\nThe key is bringing yourself to a point where you risk failure. When you do that, you start truly daring greatly.\n\nCelebrating Failure: How It\u2019s Working\n\nAs proof, it\u2019s already working for our young men at All Star Code. Our students are 80 percent black or Latino, and 70 percent are eligible for free or reduced lunch. Yet virtually all of them matriculated to college, with 30 percent at top 100 national universities, and 85 percent majoring or minoring in computer science.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey are doing what so many others fail to do: getting hired (as software engineering interns) at Google, Facebook, JPMorgan Chase, NASA, Goldman Sachs and other top employers. They are not letting failure stop them, and they are not letting the fear of failure prevent them from trying.\n\nFollow our journey, and see the impact of celebrating failure by signing up for All Star Code\u2019s newsletter.\n\n", "keywords": ["students", "failure", "fear", "fail", "life", "try", "tech", "change", "star", "think", "color", "start", "celebrating"], "polarity": 0.022665721097398114, "subjectivity": 0.47767647811126024},

During a meeting between the two Republicans, Minor began asking Harold questions about her sexuality and her marital status, asking, \u201cAre you a lesbo?\u201d multiple times. The conversation reportedly turned heated when Minor \u201cused the full n-word.\u201d\n\nIn a letter to state Republicans, Illinois House leader Peter Breen wrote that Minor confirmed the details of the conversation and his use of the slurs to Breen. To be fair, though, Breen says that Minor claims he had a good reason:\n\nAt an in-person meeting that Mr. Minor requested with me, with a witness present, Mr. Minor confirmed that he had asked Ms. Harold if she was a lesbian and that he had used the full n-word in her and her assistant\u2019s presence. He explained this away by claiming that Ms. Harold \u201cwanted him to ask the question\u201d about her sexual orientation and claiming that Ms. Harold asked him to say the full n-word. Suffice it to say, this is not how the other participants to the meeting heard or understood the statements, nor how they reported those statements to others both immediately after the meeting occurred and consistently in the months since.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolitico confirmed the conversation with multiple sources, saying that Minor asked the questions so he could \u201cget it on the record,\u201d and while Minor would not comment to Politico, he earlier insisted that he did not use the \u201cfull n-word\u201d because he and Harold are friends.\n\nWhich brings up a great point:\n\nWhat the hell is \u201cthe full n-word\u201d? It is repeatedly mentioned by the people in this controversy, but I have no idea what it is. Did the town chairman simply emphasize the \u201cr\u201d at the end of the word, or it possible that there is a longer, more detestable version of \u201cnigger\u201d that white people have been keeping secret all these years?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDid Burt Minor call Erika Harold a \u201cniggerilla\u201d?\n\nIllinois Republicans are now rescinding their endorsements from Minor because, while Republicans have no problem passing racist, homophobic legislation and injecting it into their political agenda, they can\u2019t have a party member walking around using the full n-word.\n\nWhich brings up a greater point:\n\nIf you\u2019re a black Republican, shouldn\u2019t you expect to be called the n-word? It\u2019s like hiring Bill Cosby to bartend at a slumber party or asking R. Kelly to chaperone a junior high school dance\u2014you know what\u2019s going to happen.

And while I didn\u2019t see this happening during the movie, I\u2019m sure Wakanda has amazing bottomless brunches.\n\nUnfortunately, a present-day attempt to re-create Wakanda would be unrealistic. Mainly because we\u2019re roughly 20,000 years behind Wakandan tech. And mostly because we\u2019re too infected with colonization and its myriad residues and peripheral effects.

I love them so much that I have two pairs: the wine-and-navy-blue \u201cNew Heights\u201d colorway and the black \u201cMetallic Gold\u201d colorway. They go with everything, and the fit is comfortable enough (and they\u2019re light enough) that I don\u2019t actually feel like I\u2019m wearing basketball shoes.\n\nAnd I\u2019m not much of a basketball-shoe fan in general. I own two pairs of Jordans\u2014they\u2019re both Jordan 1s\u2014and the rest of my shoes are running shoes, casual shoes or boots. Even buying these LeBrons took a while, since, again, I\u2019m not big on basketball shoes and I\u2019ve always found his to look rather bulky on display in stores.\n\nBut one day I was in Foot Locker\u2019s House of Hoops section, and I saw the New Heights XVs sitting on display. I thought they looked interesting, but they also looked pretty unflattering. That day I kept it moving, but the shoes stayed in the back of my mind.\n\nThat\u2019s how I end up buying most of the shoes I like: They stay on my mind. I rarely buy shoes the first time I see them. But if I can\u2019t shake the idea that I want them, I\u2019ll typically go back. I returned to Foot Locker to check them out on every trip to the mall but was still unconvinced that they were shoes I needed to own.\n\nI follow LeBron on Instagram, and there are tons of pictures of his shoes on his feed. The vast majority of them didn\u2019t get me. But there was one picture I saw where he was standing against a car dressed in street clothes, wearing something similar enough to what I\u2019d wear, and he had on his shoes; they looked awesome.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt that point, I decided that I was going to go try them on. Even though I found them unremarkable on display, seeing them on his feet (even through the \u2019gram) rocketed my passing interest to coveting.\n\nSo I went to the store, tried them on and realized, \u201cOh, sweet Jesus\u2014these joints are beauuuutiful on my feet.\u201d Perhaps it\u2019s hyperbolic, but I loved how they looked. I plopped down my money with a smile on my face, feeling ecstatic to separate myself from my hard-earned $196.10 (including tax).\n\nAfter wearing them out, a funny thing started to happen: Several dudes told me that seeing them on somebody convinced them that the shoes were actually pretty fly. It seems that I wasn\u2019t the only one struggling with whether the XVs were dope or not. Some folks were going to buy them because they\u2019re LeBrons. Others are sneakerheads, and while I\u2019m a fringe sneakerhead, I have no idea if the XVs were a hype-beast shoe of choice. But many of us were looking at them in stores and just unconvinced of their potential. But seeing them on my feet changed the game for some people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s happened at least five times. The latest was at a baby shower I attended this past weekend. I threw on the black XVs, and while I was walking around snapping pictures of the event, a friend of mine stopped me and said, \u201cYou\u2019ve convinced me.\u201d I asked him what he was talking about, and he pointed at my feet and said he\u2019d been on the fence, but seeing them on my feet persuaded him that he should cop them.\n\nIt happened at a nightclub once as well. I was walking around minding my business when two dudes walked up to me and said something very similar\u2014that on display, the XVs just don\u2019t look that dope, so they hadn\u2019t even thought to try them on until they peeped them on my feet. Happened at brunch once and randomly at a restaurant bar while I was eating lunch\u2014on the street once, too. It seems that LeBron\u2019s XVs are the ultimate in deceptively fly.\n\nIf you\u2019re into shoes at all, you\u2019re going to pay attention to them. You may hate them, but you will notice them, and I even imagine it\u2019s hard to hate them because they\u2019re so distinctive. The shoes are made of \u201cBattleKnit,\u201d a Flyknit-weave take on the Flyknit material that so many running shoes are currently made of, with the very popular \u201csock\u201d styling that\u2019s all over the sneaker market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey have a look to them, but in stores they look oddly shaped at best. And even on LeBron\u2019s feet in the games\u2014there are tons of pictures featuring his shoes\u2014they didn\u2019t sway me one way or another.

For most of my life my fear of failure was so strong, I would not even consider opportunities unless I was confident that I could achieve them.\n\n\n\nSo my time in college was largely defined by taking the safer route, especially avoiding anything that would put me in direct competition with my famous entrepreneurial father. I made choices that I thought were common sense but in retrospect were driven by risk aversion. These choices included not pursuing any student activities related to investing, not running for any leadership role (unless someone else nominated me), and choosing to major in history and literature instead of economics.\n\nFor example, I applied for a postgraduate fellowship for photojournalism instead of writing because I thought it made my application stronger, even though news photography had become less interesting to me.\n\nThey cut me in the final round. I was surprised, having chosen the safer route and expecting it to pay off for me. To think, if I had followed my instincts, my dream and my heart, I might have been able to pursue the writing opportunity I originally wanted, because that\u2019s where my true talent was.\n\n\n\nMy risk aversion even led me to give up on things I was good at. My junior year, I gave up my bimonthly opinion column in the school newspaper. For a year and a half, I had exhausted myself making every essay an original idea. I thought that was what I needed to do to be excellent.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe pressure burned me out. Also, my good friend wanted the slot. Never mind that the dean of the college had invited me to a regular lunch as a result of my column (my topics were campus life and issues of racial justice). Never mind that I had won the column fair and square through a campuswide contest.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou gave up a column?!\u201d said a prospective mentor, a noted female opinion writer, years later. \u201cThat\u2019s crazy.\u201d\n\nVoluntarily giving up a column was so unusual, the dean assumed that I had graduated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am here to tell you about a radical concept that changed my life for the better, and may help you with yours: celebrating failure. My organization, All Star Code, developed it as a foundational part of its curriculum and uses it to empower young men of color to be successful in tech. However, the practice of celebrating failure works for everyone.\n\nWhy Fear of Failure Runs Deep\n\nFor black and brown people, the world trains them to think that they should seem perfect. There is so much evidence of the ways that black students aren\u2019t allowed to fail. According to the 2017 Brown Center Report on Education, in 2015 the statewide African-American suspension rate in California was 17.8 percent, much higher than for other groups. For Latinos, the suspension rate was 5.2 percent; for whites, 4.4 percent; and for Asians, 1.2 percent. Minor infractions and mistakes get big punishments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nParents of black and brown boys often create a \u201cno mistakes\u201d culture. I am thinking of \u201cthe talk,\u201d the script of tightly controlled moves for how to behave around a police officer. It\u2019s tragic, because the freedom to express your emotions should be a basic human right. And while I don\u2019t endorse arguing with police officers, the truth is, that\u2019s the natural thing to do if you\u2019ve been wrongfully arrested; and quite frankly, white people do it all the time.\n\nThe pressure not to fail\u2014not just on the streets (or in a park); heck, to never make a mistake or relax\u2014also exists in school. Too often in our educational systems, the consequences of innocent mischief for our boys and girls can be too harsh.\n\nWhen you engage with a field such as tech, this can be problematic. The goal is to innovate\u2014that is, to have wild ideas and the willingness to try them. But the thing with trying to do something that has never been done before is that you are bound to make mistakes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMistakes are behaviors whose impact is the opposite of what you intended. In other words, things you did wrong (eek, gasp!). In The Lean Startup, Eric Ries describes the build-measure-learn feedback loop in innovation. First you build something, then you try it out, measure (aka, what is working and what isn\u2019t) and then learn from your mistakes (as well as your successes). Based on those assessments, you start building all over again.\n\nCelebrating Failure: How It Works\n\nIn 2014, I was in a circle with my team yelling as loud as we dared, \u201cI have failed!\u201d and then cheering and clapping wildly. It was at the behest of a 23-year-old computer-engineering graduate who had run the country\u2019s largest collegiate hackathon. His name was Jon and I had hired him to develop a curriculum that would expose our students foremost to how to think like an engineer. I picked him because he is one of the most freethinking, interesting people I have ever met.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy general directive was that I wanted the program to \u201copen the world\u201d to our students, who are primarily black and Latino and in high school. Jon told me that the key was to teach them to celebrate failure\u2014hence the exercise, \u201cI have failed.\u201d\n\nI remember doing it, and it felt like a huge release. I loved it. We loved it. And now it is a huge part of the success of my organization, All Star Code.\n\nI founded All Star Code in 2013. We teach computer science to young men of color with the goal of developing a new generation of entrepreneurs who have the tools to be successful in tech. \u201cCelebrating failure\u201d is one of the three pillars of our organization (pdf), and a tool we teach our students. We have even implemented a \u201cfail wall,\u201d where we share our failures and clap for one another in the classroom when a failure is shared. This practice is designed to lower inhibitions and helps counteract this fear of failure, allowing them to experiment and do more. Through this practice, we combat the desire to be perfect.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Freedom to Fail\n\nWhen we say \u201cWe celebrate failure here,\u201d it turbocharges the learning because students start to come forward with their mistakes. At the beginning of the summer, these 16-year-olds walk into the classroom tense and uncertain (the classrooms are inside some of the top companies and colleges in America). Often, they have their baseball hats on. They are reluctant to take off their backpacks, even wearing them while sitting down.\n\nDuring the exercise, it\u2019s important for someone to take the lead in embracing looking ridiculous. Big gestures and yelling loudly are very important: \u201cI HAVE FAILED!\u201d We stand on chairs. We might jump and pump our fists. Going around the circle, you see people calibrate how loud they feel they can allow themselves to be. But after this moment, the whole culture of the classroom transforms.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe \u201cI have failed\u201d exercise transforms their demeanor. Their posture shifts; they start looking each other in the eye. They smile more. They relax. The backpacks and hats come off. They feel freed.\n\nThe culture of tech does not trust anyone who is not comfortable with making mistakes. In planning All Star Code, I interviewed roughly 150 people, including people of color who were executives in tech or tech-enabled companies, and also people of color who were frustrated at their inability to break in.\n\nAnd yet based on my five years of developing a pipeline from high school into college and industry internships for young men of color, I think that one of the biggest obstacles to success for many African Americans and within other communities of color is the fear of failure that has been programmed into us by society. This has led to a reluctance within these communities to admit when you have made a mistake. But this covering up of problems is incompatible with tech\u2019s \u201cfail harder, fail fast\u201d culture and with the mentality that its job is to solve problems. You can\u2019t solve problems if you don\u2019t talk about them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe reason celebrating failure is such a powerful practice for lifelong learning is that it breaks the cycle. It provides the space for one to start talking about, reflecting on and learning from one\u2019s experience. What prevents people from actually learning from failure is the fear of failure itself.\n\nFor Each Failed Try, Clap for Yourself\n\nWith all due respect to Yoda, I think you have to try in order to do.\n\nThe next time you catch yourself obsessing over something that went wrong or worrying about something that could go wrong, try approaching it differently. Take a deep breath, mentally cheer for yourself and celebrate the fact that you are doing something difficult.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter you have felt your stress levels go down, smile, go and talk to someone, and share what you\u2019re struggling with. Believe it or not, that\u2019s the beginning of receiving the help you need.\n\nThe key is bringing yourself to a point where you risk failure. When you do that, you start truly daring greatly.\n\nCelebrating Failure: How It\u2019s Working\n\nAs proof, it\u2019s already working for our young men at All Star Code. Our students are 80 percent black or Latino, and 70 percent are eligible for free or reduced lunch. Yet virtually all of them matriculated to college, with 30 percent at top 100 national universities, and 85 percent majoring or minoring in computer science.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey are doing what so many others fail to do: getting hired (as software engineering interns) at Google, Facebook, JPMorgan Chase, NASA, Goldman Sachs and other top employers. They are not letting failure stop them, and they are not letting the fear of failure prevent them from trying.\n\nFollow our journey, and see the impact of celebrating failure by signing up for All Star Code\u2019s newsletter.\n\n", "keywords": ["students", "failure", "fear", "fail", "life", "try", "tech", "change", "star", "think", "color", "start", "celebrating"], "polarity": 0.022665721097398114, "subjectivity": 0.47767647811126024},

One, because people are usually wrong about that stuff, and I enjoy not being wrong. It's fun. But also, remembering the past in an historical sense is necessary. The \"back and the day when things were better\" game, however, isn't just (usually) wrong. It's fucking boring. I agree with Tony Soprano. \"Remember when\" truly is the lowest form of conversation.\n\nAnd, as a self-appointed guardian of the present, if someone says something like \"Drake wouldn't have survived in the 90s\" within earshot, I feel duty bound to reply \"Um, Coolio sold a trillion records and won a damn Grammy in the 90s. Drake would have been fine.\"\n\nSame goes with sports (because if you watched and assessed 90's basketball with 35-year-old eyes instead of 15-year-old eyes, your feelings about those guys would probably be different), kids today, and even crime (because murder rates have actually dropped tremendously since the early 90s).\n\nThat said, there's one place where I will never not be convinced that things are totally, absolutely, 100% worse than they were back in the day. And that place is the display rack at Foot Locker or Champs or Finish Line or wherever the hell else sneakers are sold today. Now, compared to when I was in high school and college, sneakers themselves come in bolder colors. Kids today apparently love two things: Big Sean and color-blocking. But, aside from them maybe being a bit lighter, they haven't changed much structurally. High tops are still high. Low tops are low. And Adidas hoop sneakers will still tear your ACL. But, HOLY F*CKING SHIT!!! WHEN DID THEY GET SO GOTDAMN EXPENSIVE????? I remember when the only shoes consistently above $100 were Jordans, Foamposites, and maybe a random signature shoe like the Penny Hardaways or the Iversons.

I didn't even bother turning my head in the direction of the Jordan Brand section. I've never had an epiphytic shock seizure, and I don't want to start now. I eventually settled on the Kyrie All-Stars, which I copped for the (relatively) low price of $120.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, I'm aware inflation exists. Everything from electric bills to lapdances generally cost more now than they did 20, even 10 years ago. Because Obama. But sneaker inflation seems to be playing by a different set of rules.

Now, I'm not sure how much a 1995 Accord cost, but I'm sure the price has increased since then. I'm also certain the Honda people didn't have this conversation in 1995:\n\n\"What should our business plan be for the next 20 years?\"\n\n\"I think the Accord is fine as is.

For most of my life my fear of failure was so strong, I would not even consider opportunities unless I was confident that I could achieve them.\n\n\n\nSo my time in college was largely defined by taking the safer route, especially avoiding anything that would put me in direct competition with my famous entrepreneurial father. I made choices that I thought were common sense but in retrospect were driven by risk aversion. These choices included not pursuing any student activities related to investing, not running for any leadership role (unless someone else nominated me), and choosing to major in history and literature instead of economics.\n\nFor example, I applied for a postgraduate fellowship for photojournalism instead of writing because I thought it made my application stronger, even though news photography had become less interesting to me.\n\nThey cut me in the final round. I was surprised, having chosen the safer route and expecting it to pay off for me. To think, if I had followed my instincts, my dream and my heart, I might have been able to pursue the writing opportunity I originally wanted, because that\u2019s where my true talent was.\n\n\n\nMy risk aversion even led me to give up on things I was good at. My junior year, I gave up my bimonthly opinion column in the school newspaper. For a year and a half, I had exhausted myself making every essay an original idea. I thought that was what I needed to do to be excellent.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe pressure burned me out. Also, my good friend wanted the slot.

My organization, All Star Code, developed it as a foundational part of its curriculum and uses it to empower young men of color to be successful in tech. However, the practice of celebrating failure works for everyone.\n\nWhy Fear of Failure Runs Deep\n\nFor black and brown people, the world trains them to think that they should seem perfect. There is so much evidence of the ways that black students aren\u2019t allowed to fail. According to the 2017 Brown Center Report on Education, in 2015 the statewide African-American suspension rate in California was 17.8 percent, much higher than for other groups. For Latinos, the suspension rate was 5.2 percent; for whites, 4.4 percent; and for Asians, 1.2 percent. Minor infractions and mistakes get big punishments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nParents of black and brown boys often create a \u201cno mistakes\u201d culture. I am thinking of \u201cthe talk,\u201d the script of tightly controlled moves for how to behave around a police officer. It\u2019s tragic, because the freedom to express your emotions should be a basic human right. And while I don\u2019t endorse arguing with police officers, the truth is, that\u2019s the natural thing to do if you\u2019ve been wrongfully arrested; and quite frankly, white people do it all the time.\n\nThe pressure not to fail\u2014not just on the streets (or in a park); heck, to never make a mistake or relax\u2014also exists in school. Too often in our educational systems, the consequences of innocent mischief for our boys and girls can be too harsh.\n\nWhen you engage with a field such as tech, this can be problematic. The goal is to innovate\u2014that is, to have wild ideas and the willingness to try them. But the thing with trying to do something that has never been done before is that you are bound to make mistakes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMistakes are behaviors whose impact is the opposite of what you intended. In other words, things you did wrong (eek, gasp!). In The Lean Startup, Eric Ries describes the build-measure-learn feedback loop in innovation. First you build something, then you try it out, measure (aka, what is working and what isn\u2019t) and then learn from your mistakes (as well as your successes). Based on those assessments, you start building all over again.\n\nCelebrating Failure: How It Works\n\nIn 2014, I was in a circle with my team yelling as loud as we dared, \u201cI have failed!\u201d and then cheering and clapping wildly. It was at the behest of a 23-year-old computer-engineering graduate who had run the country\u2019s largest collegiate hackathon. His name was Jon and I had hired him to develop a curriculum that would expose our students foremost to how to think like an engineer. I picked him because he is one of the most freethinking, interesting people I have ever met.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy general directive was that I wanted the program to \u201copen the world\u201d to our students, who are primarily black and Latino and in high school. Jon told me that the key was to teach them to celebrate failure\u2014hence the exercise, \u201cI have failed.\u201d\n\nI remember doing it, and it felt like a huge release. I loved it. We loved it. And now it is a huge part of the success of my organization, All Star Code.\n\nI founded All Star Code in 2013. We teach computer science to young men of color with the goal of developing a new generation of entrepreneurs who have the tools to be successful in tech. \u201cCelebrating failure\u201d is one of the three pillars of our organization (pdf), and a tool we teach our students. We have even implemented a \u201cfail wall,\u201d where we share our failures and clap for one another in the classroom when a failure is shared. This practice is designed to lower inhibitions and helps counteract this fear of failure, allowing them to experiment and do more. Through this practice, we combat the desire to be perfect.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Freedom to Fail\n\nWhen we say \u201cWe celebrate failure here,\u201d it turbocharges the learning because students start to come forward with their mistakes. At the beginning of the summer, these 16-year-olds walk into the classroom tense and uncertain (the classrooms are inside some of the top companies and colleges in America). Often, they have their baseball hats on. They are reluctant to take off their backpacks, even wearing them while sitting down.\n\nDuring the exercise, it\u2019s important for someone to take the lead in embracing looking ridiculous. Big gestures and yelling loudly are very important: \u201cI HAVE FAILED!\u201d We stand on chairs. We might jump and pump our fists. Going around the circle, you see people calibrate how loud they feel they can allow themselves to be. But after this moment, the whole culture of the classroom transforms.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe \u201cI have failed\u201d exercise transforms their demeanor. Their posture shifts; they start looking each other in the eye. They smile more. They relax. The backpacks and hats come off. They feel freed.\n\nThe culture of tech does not trust anyone who is not comfortable with making mistakes. In planning All Star Code, I interviewed roughly 150 people, including people of color who were executives in tech or tech-enabled companies, and also people of color who were frustrated at their inability to break in.\n\nAnd yet based on my five years of developing a pipeline from high school into college and industry internships for young men of color, I think that one of the biggest obstacles to success for many African Americans and within other communities of color is the fear of failure that has been programmed into us by society. This has led to a reluctance within these communities to admit when you have made a mistake. But this covering up of problems is incompatible with tech\u2019s \u201cfail harder, fail fast\u201d culture and with the mentality that its job is to solve problems. You can\u2019t solve problems if you don\u2019t talk about them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe reason celebrating failure is such a powerful practice for lifelong learning is that it breaks the cycle. It provides the space for one to start talking about, reflecting on and learning from one\u2019s experience. What prevents people from actually learning from failure is the fear of failure itself.\n\nFor Each Failed Try, Clap for Yourself\n\nWith all due respect to Yoda, I think you have to try in order to do.\n\nThe next time you catch yourself obsessing over something that went wrong or worrying about something that could go wrong, try approaching it differently. Take a deep breath, mentally cheer for yourself and celebrate the fact that you are doing something difficult.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter you have felt your stress levels go down, smile, go and talk to someone, and share what you\u2019re struggling with. Believe it or not, that\u2019s the beginning of receiving the help you need.\n\nThe key is bringing yourself to a point where you risk failure. When you do that, you start truly daring greatly.\n\nCelebrating Failure: How It\u2019s Working\n\nAs proof, it\u2019s already working for our young men at All Star Code. Our students are 80 percent black or Latino, and 70 percent are eligible for free or reduced lunch. Yet virtually all of them matriculated to college, with 30 percent at top 100 national universities, and 85 percent majoring or minoring in computer science.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey are doing what so many others fail to do: getting hired (as software engineering interns) at Google, Facebook, JPMorgan Chase, NASA, Goldman Sachs and other top employers. They are not letting failure stop them, and they are not letting the fear of failure prevent them from trying.\n\nFollow our journey, and see the impact of celebrating failure by signing up for All Star Code\u2019s newsletter.\n\n", "keywords": ["students", "failure", "fear", "fail", "life", "try", "tech", "change", "star", "think", "color", "start", "celebrating"], "polarity": 0.022665721097398114, "subjectivity": 0.47767647811126024},

Mary goes online\u2014to a new kind of international gig economy website, a Fiverr for immigrants\u2014and applies to sponsor a migrant. She enters information about what she needs: someone with rudimentary English skills, no criminal record and an affection for animals. She offers a room in her basement, meals and $5 an hour. (Sponsors under this program would be exempt from paying minimum wage.) The website offers Mary some matches\u2014people living in foreign countries who would like to spend some time in the United States and earn some money. After some back and forth, Mary interviews a woman named Sofia who lives in Paraguay. Sofia, who grew up in a village, has endured hardships that few Americans can imagine. She is eager to earn some money so that she could move to her nation\u2019s capital city and get some vocational training. A few weeks later, Sofia arrives in Wheeling, after taking a one-week training course on American ways.

High School employee is facing the music after he was recorded on cellphone video playing a game of hangman that used the n-word.\n\nAs the Kokomo Tribune reports, the eight-second video shows a student and Greg Ostapa, a paraprofessional at the high school, playing the easily recognized game on a tablet. The tablet shows that the word \u201cnigger\u201d is almost spelled out. The student is seen smiling as the video is recorded, because of course.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat makes this case even more interesting is that the student who posted the video on Twitter, and caused it to blow up, was the one who was suspended from the school.\n\nSiciley Cannon said that at first she shared the video on Snapchat, with several people capturing it. Some of those individuals shared it with administrators, and by Wednesday, she says, she was called in to the office to discuss the video.\n\nShe was then informed that there was a handbook policy stating that students cannot film other students or staff without their consent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI did not think I was going to get in trouble,\u201d Cannon told the news site. \u201cI would have never thought, \u2018I\u2019m about to get in trouble for this.\u2019\u201d\n\nCannon said that Ostapa made it appear that it was OK for the student to write out the offensive slur, adding that he laughed it off.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen he saw that I didn\u2019t think it was funny, he hurried up and tried to erase it,\u201d she said. \u201cHe just didn\u2019t make it seem like what he was doing was wrong.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is a petition going around demanding that Cannon\u2019s suspension be lifted and expunged from her permanent record. That petition on Change.org has collected more than 600 signatures.\n\nThe Kokomo School Corp. told the Tribune that Cannon was disciplined because she violated the school handbook\u2019s policy. There is no word as to what form of discipline the student involved in the game may face, although the Kokomo School Corp. said that the student had been disciplined according to school guidelines. In addition, the paraprofessional is facing losing his job.\n\nHowever, some say that the school needs to come out with a stronger stance against such acts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey did say the matter has been taken care of,\u201d Tessa Vaughan, the parent of one of the students who started the petition on Cannon\u2019s behalf, told the news site. \u201cBut I did tell them that\u2019s not enough.

In Pittsburgh alone, there are at least 26 different grades of whiteness, including garden-variety Yinzer whiteness, Appalachian-adjacent whiteness, well-meaning Patagonia whiteness, Lululemon whiteness and Ben Roethlisberger.\n\nAnd sometimes, as in the story about Belen Aldecosea\u2014the Florida woman who, when allegedly told that she wasn\u2019t allowed to bring her emotional-support hamster on a plane, allegedly flushed said hamster down the toilet\u2014the levels of whiteness converge to form a whiteness souffl\u00e9. A whiteness manicotti. A whiteness Thai fried rice.\n\nAnyway, there are too many levels of whiteness in this story to list at one time, so I\u2019ll just name 10.\n\n1. The fact that she has an emotional-support animal. Because the only emotional 0-support animals black people get are lice in prison bunk beds.\n\n2. The fact that her emotional-support animal is a fucking hamster. Hamsters are cute and great and all, but there\u2019s nothing about a hamster that has ever made me think, \u201cI wish that hamster would give me a hug.\u201d This must have been a charismatic-ass hamster. The Mahershala Ali of hamsters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. The fact that she attempted to bring a gotdamn rodent on a plane. The bulk of my adult life has been spent intentionally avoiding enclosed places where rodents might be. I\u2019ve never, ever, ever, ever been in a place and thought, \u201cYou know what this space needs? More rodents.\u201d\n\n4. Again, the fact that she attempted to bring a gotdamn rodent on a plane. I\u2019m so wary of airport security that I practically fly naked now and my only carry-on is a ziplock bag, and she\u2019s trying to get gotdamn rats through the X-ray machine.\n\n5. The fact that, after being told, \u201cNo, you cannot bring this rat on the plane with you, you silly motherfucker,\u201d she reportedly flushed it down the toilet. Apparently, her rationale was that this was a humane way to get rid of it. But on my list of terrible ways to die, drowning to death in an airport toilet is pretty damn near the top. Also, why not just let him loose in a Chick-fil-A or something? Of course, he\u2019d probably get caught and killed, but at least he\u2019d die with a full stomach.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAND IF THIS ANIMAL IS SO IMPORTANT TO YOU, WHY DON\u2019T YOU JUST LEAVE THE AIRPORT AND CATCH A GOTDAMN MEGABUS?\n\n6. The fact that she has a gotdamn lawyer. Which means a lawsuit is a possibility.\n\n7. The fact that her gotdamn lawyer was quoted as saying, \u201cThis was a highly stressful situation, and people react in a lot of different ways. She\u2019s only 21 years old, a kid still,\u201d despite the fact that she\u2019s 21 FUCKING YEARS OLD, WHICH MEANS SHE IS NOT A KID STILL.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. The fact that she apparently already has a new hamster, one that I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll also murder when told she\u2019s not allowed to co-sign a loan for it.\n\n9. The fact that SOMEONE SOLD ANOTHER HAMSTER TO AN INFAMOUS HAMSTER MURDERER. Niggas go to prison for 50 years for stealing Snickers Ice Cream Bars, and this known hamster murderer gets help.\n\n10.

The greater news is that it\u2019s a black creation courtesy of first-generation Nigerian Americans Esosa Ighodaro and Abiodun \u201cA.J.\u201d Johnson.\n\nWhen Johnson complimented Ighodaro\u2019s outfit on a New York City subway platform years ago, they had no idea they would be here. At the time, neither one of them had even considered an app like CoSign. That is until Johnson saw a pair of red shoes in a car commercial that he needed in his life. But when he went to the all-knowing internet, he surprisingly struck out. When he noticed he wasn\u2019t the only one looking for those red shoes, an app was born.\n\nCoSign bills itself as an app that \u201chelps style-conscious millennials monetize their social media images.\u201d And CoSign makes it super easy. Just download the CoSign app. Once it\u2019s in place, \u201csnap or upload a picture of your favorite product. Tag the product info. Share it on your social media channels.\u201d Then wait for the ka-ching because, if they buy, you earn. Social commerce is what it\u2019s called. \u201cIt\u2019s peer-to-peer recommendation, and we\u2019re trying to amplify that,\u201d says Johnson.\n\nWhen the duo started out, they didn\u2019t have money per se. Luckily Johnson, a Dartmouth grad who grew up mainly in Memphis, Tenn., worked initially in the tech industry in project management and later in e-commerce. Ighodaro, a Temple grad who was born and raised in Brooklyn, N.Y., worked in finance and banking. But like anyone else, they had to start, even with full-time jobs.\n\n\u201cThe first step for us was kind of putting together sketches in regards to what we were looking to create from an app perspective and then just finding the right team to put a prototype together,\u201d explains Johnson.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe put our money into it to begin the initial prototype phase and then, after that, started raising money through friends and family to make the more valuable product,\u201d he says.\n\nBecause they were \u201cexploring untapped territory,\u201d says Ighodaro, they were \u201creally working with the tech team to create something that [didn\u2019t] exist.\u201d\n\nKickstarter showed them that they weren\u2019t the only ones interested in the outcome. In just 30 days, CoSign raised more than $41,000, which forced them to double down and make it work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat really changed the game for us,\u201d Ighodaro says, \u201cbecause it no longer became this thing that you\u2019re working on, on your own, in the basement. It\u2019s a concept that people actually got behind and put their own money in and said, \u2018Hey, we want you to build this concept.\u2019\u201d\n\nTheir supporters meant it, too. When the concept Johnson and Ighodaro conceived in 2013 finally entered the beta stage in 2015, they expected the input of a couple of hundred participants to make it better and received thousands instead.\n\nSo when CoSign became available for mass consumption, it wasn\u2019t really surprising how quickly it caught on with both consumers and retailers like Sephora and Neiman Marcus. A bonus is that right now, this lane is still almost exclusively theirs. \u201cWe don\u2019t really have a true competitor that\u2019s doing what we\u2019re doing,\u201d Ighodaro says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeing embraced by the tech community and having various publications, ranging from Delta Sky magazine to the Okay Africa website, feature them hasn\u2019t blinded Ighodaro or Johnson to the barriers that techpreneurs of color face.\n\n\u201cAs you know, minorities, typically, we\u2019re not getting funded at a high-enough rate as the other startups, so less funding [equals] less resources and less [mobility] for us,\u201d Johnson says. \u201cThere are a lot of minorities who are trying to create companies, but they are just not able to get money to last long enough to get revenue.\u201d\n\nThat is especially true when that techpreneur is a black woman, says Ighodaro.\n\n\u201c#ProjectDiane is this report that shows how many black women have actually raised money as a tech founder, and I think it\u2019s only been 14 total who have actually raised over a million dollars, which is unfortunate and incredibly abysmal,\u201d she schools. \u201cThe average black woman raises about $36,000 for her startup, compared to the average white guy, who raises about $1.4 million for that technology startup. You can last a little bit longer with $1.4 million. So, yes, we can be scrappy with what we have, but there\u2019s definitely a need to have more of that social capital to find those folks who can take a chance on smart, talented, scrappy people of color that are creating great businesses of value.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd even as Ighodaro and Johnson prioritize growing CoSign, they do their best to make themselves available to up-and-coming techpreneurs. \u201cYou fit it in when you can,\u201d says Ighodaro, who gladly pays it forward thanks to tech veterans \u201cway past me who help me with different challenges that I am facing.\u201d\n\nWhile Ighodaro encourages others to \u201ctake the risk,\u201d she keeps it 100. \u201cIt\u2019s really daunting,\u201d she warns. \u201cI\u2019m not going to try to pretend like it\u2019s a walk in the park by any means. Some of the other things that most people don\u2019t even talk about is the emotional trials entrepreneurship brings and the emotional stress what weighs on you with really trying to smooth this thing out.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo those determined to make a go of it, Ighodaro strongly recommends finding \u201ca strong community of people that are kind of going through the same things, because it\u2019s a lot harder to stick with it if you don\u2019t have examples or people encouraging you to do it, especially if it\u2019s something that nobody has ever done before.\u201d\n\nAdversity does have its upside, says Johnson. \u201cWe\u2019re used to working with less, so we\u2019re used to not having access to a lot of things, so we\u2019re able to be scrappy and really hustle hard to get to the next point.

Smith himself is worth about $2.5 billion, earning him a spot on the Forbes list as the second-richest African American in the U.S., second only, that is, to Oprah.\n\n\u201cLike all things, you have to decide if you take a risk or not, and I looked at it and said, \u2018Well, how am I gonna feel, you know, 15, 20 years from now, if I don\u2019t take this risk and go try this?\u2019\u201d Smith said in an interview with 9News. \u201cThere is that fear, that constant fear of, you know, stepping backwards; you go off the cliff.

Smith worked for Bell Labs in the years that followed, and it was there that he grew his love of science.\n\nAfter graduating from Cornell University, Smith took a position on Wall Street with Goldman Sachs, and then one day, he decided to start his own company and never looked back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSmith says his persistence has carried him this far, and it continues to do so.

From \u201cMake America great again\u201d to his petty preoccupation with reversing literally everything President Barack Obama did, no one in recent memory has been better at tailoring their actions and communications to convey a very specific point to a very specific group of people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo wit, take a look at his recent tweets admonishing Marshawn Lynch and LaVar Ball.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe existence of these tweets is a dog whistle in itself. A white person in power publicly admonishing uppity blacks is chum to Trump\u2019s base (and by \u201cTrump\u2019s base\u201d I mean \u201cAmerica\u201d), and these tweeting sprees are feeding sessions.\n\nThe language here matters, too\u2014specifically the idea of disrespect and the lack of proper reverence for Trump\u2019s big white benevolence. What he is saying is that these black people need to be grateful for what they have\u2014and what he\u2019s specifically given them\u2014but since they\u2019re very obviously not, they need to be reminded, publicly and vehemently, of their place and position. Basically, let\u2019s not forget\u2014and let\u2019s not allow them to forget\u2014that they\u2019re niggers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe \u201cdisrespectful black\u201d employed as a stand-in for \u201cnigger\u201d isn\u2019t new. It stretches back as far as the invention of the nigger does. The nigger was created to hierarchize and to justify subjugation. And when one of us dared step out of line or question this status, we were ungrateful niggers without the moral or intellectual acuity to recognize how appreciative we should be. Now, since \u201cnigger\u201d is no longer allowed in polite society, a reference to that damning lack of perpetual genuflection articulates that same point.\n\n\u201cThey already get so many things for free,\u201d they\u2019re wont to say, \u201cso why are they protesting and not on their knees in thanks?\u201d\n\nThis, of course, is just one of the many terms shoehorned into the American lexicon now to describe and communicate and distinguish the nigger without actually saying that word. Because of course saying that would be racist. And racism is wrong.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe all know about \u201cthug,\u201d which has been such an obvious dog whistle for so long that the word itself is (rightly) seen as a slur. It officially transcended the dog whistle. Which I guess would make it a ... ghost whistle?\n\nThen there\u2019s any out-of-context reference to Chicago, which is such an absurd \u201cnigger\u201d stand-in when you remember that it\u2019s a fucking city. A city where whites are still the largest racial demographic. Chicago as a nigger stand-in is like, I don\u2019t know, if white people started calling us \u201cKia Cadenzas.\u201d\n\nBut as odd as Chicago is, I\u2019m not quite sure if it beats the surreality of allusions to the government. The federal government particularly. I forgot exactly where I first read or heard it, but along with the fact that many whites believe that we (niggers) are disproportionally supported by the government\u2014an assistance we don\u2019t deserve\u2014a not-insignificant-at-all part of the white distaste for the federal government is that so many of us (niggers) have government jobs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo when they\u2019re pushing to limit the size and scope of Washington, D.C., and bureaucracies, they\u2019re ultimately pushing for niggers to have less (perceived) cushion and less income. Do they not realize that niggers/niggas hate the Man, too?\n\nOf course, there are more nigger stand-ins. Socialist. Muslim. In sports, undisciplined is a nigger stand-in fav.

These choices included not pursuing any student activities related to investing, not running for any leadership role (unless someone else nominated me), and choosing to major in history and literature instead of economics.\n\nFor example, I applied for a postgraduate fellowship for photojournalism instead of writing because I thought it made my application stronger, even though news photography had become less interesting to me.\n\nThey cut me in the final round. I was surprised, having chosen the safer route and expecting it to pay off for me. To think, if I had followed my instincts, my dream and my heart, I might have been able to pursue the writing opportunity I originally wanted, because that\u2019s where my true talent was.\n\n\n\nMy risk aversion even led me to give up on things I was good at. My junior year, I gave up my bimonthly opinion column in the school newspaper. For a year and a half, I had exhausted myself making every essay an original idea. I thought that was what I needed to do to be excellent.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe pressure burned me out. Also, my good friend wanted the slot. Never mind that the dean of the college had invited me to a regular lunch as a result of my column (my topics were campus life and issues of racial justice). Never mind that I had won the column fair and square through a campuswide contest.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou gave up a column?!\u201d said a prospective mentor, a noted female opinion writer, years later. \u201cThat\u2019s crazy.\u201d\n\nVoluntarily giving up a column was so unusual, the dean assumed that I had graduated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am here to tell you about a radical concept that changed my life for the better, and may help you with yours: celebrating failure. My organization, All Star Code, developed it as a foundational part of its curriculum and uses it to empower young men of color to be successful in tech. However, the practice of celebrating failure works for everyone.\n\nWhy Fear of Failure Runs Deep\n\nFor black and brown people, the world trains them to think that they should seem perfect. There is so much evidence of the ways that black students aren\u2019t allowed to fail. According to the 2017 Brown Center Report on Education, in 2015 the statewide African-American suspension rate in California was 17.8 percent, much higher than for other groups. For Latinos, the suspension rate was 5.2 percent; for whites, 4.4 percent; and for Asians, 1.2 percent. Minor infractions and mistakes get big punishments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nParents of black and brown boys often create a \u201cno mistakes\u201d culture. I am thinking of \u201cthe talk,\u201d the script of tightly controlled moves for how to behave around a police officer. It\u2019s tragic, because the freedom to express your emotions should be a basic human right. And while I don\u2019t endorse arguing with police officers, the truth is, that\u2019s the natural thing to do if you\u2019ve been wrongfully arrested; and quite frankly, white people do it all the time.\n\nThe pressure not to fail\u2014not just on the streets (or in a park); heck, to never make a mistake or relax\u2014also exists in school. Too often in our educational systems, the consequences of innocent mischief for our boys and girls can be too harsh.\n\nWhen you engage with a field such as tech, this can be problematic. The goal is to innovate\u2014that is, to have wild ideas and the willingness to try them. But the thing with trying to do something that has never been done before is that you are bound to make mistakes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMistakes are behaviors whose impact is the opposite of what you intended. In other words, things you did wrong (eek, gasp!). In The Lean Startup, Eric Ries describes the build-measure-learn feedback loop in innovation. First you build something, then you try it out, measure (aka, what is working and what isn\u2019t) and then learn from your mistakes (as well as your successes). Based on those assessments, you start building all over again.\n\nCelebrating Failure: How It Works\n\nIn 2014, I was in a circle with my team yelling as loud as we dared, \u201cI have failed!\u201d and then cheering and clapping wildly. It was at the behest of a 23-year-old computer-engineering graduate who had run the country\u2019s largest collegiate hackathon. His name was Jon and I had hired him to develop a curriculum that would expose our students foremost to how to think like an engineer. I picked him because he is one of the most freethinking, interesting people I have ever met.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy general directive was that I wanted the program to \u201copen the world\u201d to our students, who are primarily black and Latino and in high school. Jon told me that the key was to teach them to celebrate failure\u2014hence the exercise, \u201cI have failed.\u201d\n\nI remember doing it, and it felt like a huge release. I loved it. We loved it. And now it is a huge part of the success of my organization, All Star Code.\n\nI founded All Star Code in 2013. We teach computer science to young men of color with the goal of developing a new generation of entrepreneurs who have the tools to be successful in tech. \u201cCelebrating failure\u201d is one of the three pillars of our organization (pdf), and a tool we teach our students. We have even implemented a \u201cfail wall,\u201d where we share our failures and clap for one another in the classroom when a failure is shared. This practice is designed to lower inhibitions and helps counteract this fear of failure, allowing them to experiment and do more. Through this practice, we combat the desire to be perfect.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Freedom to Fail\n\nWhen we say \u201cWe celebrate failure here,\u201d it turbocharges the learning because students start to come forward with their mistakes. At the beginning of the summer, these 16-year-olds walk into the classroom tense and uncertain (the classrooms are inside some of the top companies and colleges in America). Often, they have their baseball hats on. They are reluctant to take off their backpacks, even wearing them while sitting down.\n\nDuring the exercise, it\u2019s important for someone to take the lead in embracing looking ridiculous. Big gestures and yelling loudly are very important: \u201cI HAVE FAILED!\u201d We stand on chairs. We might jump and pump our fists. Going around the circle, you see people calibrate how loud they feel they can allow themselves to be. But after this moment, the whole culture of the classroom transforms.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe \u201cI have failed\u201d exercise transforms their demeanor. Their posture shifts; they start looking each other in the eye. They smile more. They relax. The backpacks and hats come off. They feel freed.\n\nThe culture of tech does not trust anyone who is not comfortable with making mistakes. In planning All Star Code, I interviewed roughly 150 people, including people of color who were executives in tech or tech-enabled companies, and also people of color who were frustrated at their inability to break in.\n\nAnd yet based on my five years of developing a pipeline from high school into college and industry internships for young men of color, I think that one of the biggest obstacles to success for many African Americans and within other communities of color is the fear of failure that has been programmed into us by society. This has led to a reluctance within these communities to admit when you have made a mistake. But this covering up of problems is incompatible with tech\u2019s \u201cfail harder, fail fast\u201d culture and with the mentality that its job is to solve problems. You can\u2019t solve problems if you don\u2019t talk about them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe reason celebrating failure is such a powerful practice for lifelong learning is that it breaks the cycle. It provides the space for one to start talking about, reflecting on and learning from one\u2019s experience. What prevents people from actually learning from failure is the fear of failure itself.\n\nFor Each Failed Try, Clap for Yourself\n\nWith all due respect to Yoda, I think you have to try in order to do.\n\nThe next time you catch yourself obsessing over something that went wrong or worrying about something that could go wrong, try approaching it differently. Take a deep breath, mentally cheer for yourself and celebrate the fact that you are doing something difficult.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter you have felt your stress levels go down, smile, go and talk to someone, and share what you\u2019re struggling with. Believe it or not, that\u2019s the beginning of receiving the help you need.\n\nThe key is bringing yourself to a point where you risk failure. When you do that, you start truly daring greatly.\n\nCelebrating Failure: How It\u2019s Working\n\nAs proof, it\u2019s already working for our young men at All Star Code. Our students are 80 percent black or Latino, and 70 percent are eligible for free or reduced lunch. Yet virtually all of them matriculated to college, with 30 percent at top 100 national universities, and 85 percent majoring or minoring in computer science.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey are doing what so many others fail to do: getting hired (as software engineering interns) at Google, Facebook, JPMorgan Chase, NASA, Goldman Sachs and other top employers. They are not letting failure stop them, and they are not letting the fear of failure prevent them from trying.\n\nFollow our journey, and see the impact of celebrating failure by signing up for All Star Code\u2019s newsletter.\n\n", "keywords": ["students", "failure", "fear", "fail", "life", "try", "tech", "change", "star", "think", "color", "start", "celebrating"], "polarity": 0.022665721097398114, "subjectivity": 0.47767647811126024},

We have spent hours arguing about whether okra is a vegetable or a delivery system for Satan\u2019s backwashed phlegm. We are divided on the societal need for pumpkin spice. Some of the staff wrongly believe that \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d is a good song. In fact, there is only one topic on which we can all agree:\n\n\n\nN***** is stupid.\n\nI\u2019m not referring to the word \u201cnigger\u201d or even the colloquial spelling \u201cnigga.\u201d I\u2019m talking about the asterisked, redacted version that even a third-grader knows means \u201cnigger.\u201d Anyone who uses the star-spangled censored version of the word might as well scream it at the top of their lungs. They\u2019re not fooling anyone.\n\n\n\nPeter Vescey said \u201cnigger.\u201d\n\nDuring Monday night\u2019s game between the New York Knicks and the Cleveland Cavaliers, LeBron James and Knicks center Enes Kanter got into one of the many face-to-face mini-scuffles that happen in almost every NBA game. Veteran sports reporter Peter Vecsey thought it prudent to explain the incident by using a quote from the Notorious B.I.G.\u2019s \u201cNiggas Bleed\u201d in this tweet:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat the fuck is wrong with white people?\n\nLook, I have neither the time nor the inclination to explain why white people can\u2019t use the word, except to say that I know it\u2019s hard for them to accept that something is off-limits when they live in a world where everything belongs to them. We have all heard every Caucasiansplanation of why it is racist that white people can\u2019t say the word. Ta-Nehisi Coates explained it best last week:\n\nI firmly believe that white people\u2019s desire to use the word is buried deep in the empty hole where the soul is usually located, just waiting for the right time to manifest itself. And just as with the desire to burn a cross on a lawn or jump-start a race war, I do not believe that all white people want to say it. But I don\u2019t even care what the percentage is because I know that enough white people hold that sentiment deep in their heart cavity that we are still having this conversation in the two-thousand-seventeenth year of our Lord.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeter Vecsey is one of those white people.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: The use of \u201cwhite people\u201d is totally appropriate here. It is the only explanation as to why a high school student would have the same question as 74-year-old Peter Vecsey. It is the only thing that connects a liberal elitist like Bill Maher to a Donald Trump-supporting Mississippian: whiteness and a desire to say \u201cnigger.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVecsey is 74 years old and apparently is a fan of the Notorious B.I.G. He is also an old white man who seemingly longed to utter the word \u201cnigger,\u201d and a meaningless Monday-night game between two mediocre teams was his Caucasian Christmas.\n\nNo one thinks that Vecsey held a yearslong resentment against black people that festered inside him for seven-plus decades. I will even venture to say that Vecsey is not a racist. He probably doesn\u2019t hold an iota of hate in that heart that will soon stop ticking.\n\nPeter Vecsey is just white.\n\nThat\u2019s what white people do. They habitually line-step. They rape. They pillage. They take. Everything. There is no confusion about the word \u201cnigger.\u201d It belongs to one group of people and only one group of people. It is not complicated. Just. Don\u2019t. Say. It.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut white people cannot abide by that. They need a reason why they can\u2019t have it, too. Their privilege does not manifest itself in the fact that they want to use the word. It is in the fact that they believe they are owed an explanation for why they can\u2019t use it. That is the whitest part of the entire equation. As if \u201cBecause we said so\u201d is not enough of a reason.\n\nPeter Vecsey will probably apologize soon. He might delete the tweet and issue a mea culpa dripping with all of the appropriate white sincerity highlighted in the well-crafted retractions we have been inundated with lately. He will probably be suspended from his new job at NBA TV, and then he will retract his idiotic tweet, having fulfilled his internal, lifelong, unspoken nigger-spewing aspiration. America is nothing if not the land of second chances. Do not cry for Peter Vecsey because Peter Vecsey is white, and whiteness is a singular kind of power.\n\nIt is the same power and privilege that assumes a single black person would want to stand for the same flag that waved over the holocaust of the trans-Atlantic slave trade, the genocide of lynching and every single injustice that ever existed for black people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSlavery wasn\u2019t that bad; get over it. Jim Crow was 40 years ago. He just said \u201cnigger\u201d; what\u2019s wrong with that?\n\nThat kind of power is what deludes men like Peter Vecsey into thinking that they can take a word that doesn\u2019t belong to them and fling it around all willy-nilly. It can make a man think that he can grab a woman by the pussy. It will make the words of an alleged pedophile outweigh the accusations of five women and 30 corroborating sources. They believe all pussies belong to them. All things. All the time.\n\nIt is also the power that will make people eventually forgive Peter Vecsey for saying \u201cnigger\u201d ... because they will. It made people call bragging about sexual assault \u201clocker-room talk.\u201d It has Alabamians deliberating on whether or not they will send an accused child molester to represent them in the Senate chambers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVecsey didn\u2019t hurt a soul with his tweet. I doubt if anyone was genuinely offended. The reason people weren\u2019t upset by what he said is that Americans\u2014especially black people\u2014have grown accustomed to it. What Vecsey did is neither new nor surprising. We have grown to expect it from white people.\n\nAnd Peter Vecsey is white people.", "keywords": ["white", "cant", "nigger", "believe", "word", "black", "say", "vecsey", "peter", "probably"], "polarity": -0.018314425038562968, "subjectivity": 0.4087309051102154},

There is so much evidence of the ways that black students aren\u2019t allowed to fail. According to the 2017 Brown Center Report on Education, in 2015 the statewide African-American suspension rate in California was 17.8 percent, much higher than for other groups. For Latinos, the suspension rate was 5.2 percent; for whites, 4.4 percent; and for Asians, 1.2 percent. Minor infractions and mistakes get big punishments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nParents of black and brown boys often create a \u201cno mistakes\u201d culture. I am thinking of \u201cthe talk,\u201d the script of tightly controlled moves for how to behave around a police officer. It\u2019s tragic, because the freedom to express your emotions should be a basic human right. And while I don\u2019t endorse arguing with police officers, the truth is, that\u2019s the natural thing to do if you\u2019ve been wrongfully arrested; and quite frankly, white people do it all the time.\n\nThe pressure not to fail\u2014not just on the streets (or in a park); heck, to never make a mistake or relax\u2014also exists in school. Too often in our educational systems, the consequences of innocent mischief for our boys and girls can be too harsh.\n\nWhen you engage with a field such as tech, this can be problematic. The goal is to innovate\u2014that is, to have wild ideas and the willingness to try them. But the thing with trying to do something that has never been done before is that you are bound to make mistakes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMistakes are behaviors whose impact is the opposite of what you intended. In other words, things you did wrong (eek, gasp!). In The Lean Startup, Eric Ries describes the build-measure-learn feedback loop in innovation. First you build something, then you try it out, measure (aka, what is working and what isn\u2019t) and then learn from your mistakes (as well as your successes). Based on those assessments, you start building all over again.\n\nCelebrating Failure: How It Works\n\nIn 2014, I was in a circle with my team yelling as loud as we dared, \u201cI have failed!\u201d and then cheering and clapping wildly. It was at the behest of a 23-year-old computer-engineering graduate who had run the country\u2019s largest collegiate hackathon. His name was Jon and I had hired him to develop a curriculum that would expose our students foremost to how to think like an engineer. I picked him because he is one of the most freethinking, interesting people I have ever met.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy general directive was that I wanted the program to \u201copen the world\u201d to our students, who are primarily black and Latino and in high school. Jon told me that the key was to teach them to celebrate failure\u2014hence the exercise, \u201cI have failed.\u201d\n\nI remember doing it, and it felt like a huge release. I loved it. We loved it. And now it is a huge part of the success of my organization, All Star Code.\n\nI founded All Star Code in 2013. We teach computer science to young men of color with the goal of developing a new generation of entrepreneurs who have the tools to be successful in tech. \u201cCelebrating failure\u201d is one of the three pillars of our organization (pdf), and a tool we teach our students. We have even implemented a \u201cfail wall,\u201d where we share our failures and clap for one another in the classroom when a failure is shared. This practice is designed to lower inhibitions and helps counteract this fear of failure, allowing them to experiment and do more. Through this practice, we combat the desire to be perfect.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Freedom to Fail\n\nWhen we say \u201cWe celebrate failure here,\u201d it turbocharges the learning because students start to come forward with their mistakes. At the beginning of the summer, these 16-year-olds walk into the classroom tense and uncertain (the classrooms are inside some of the top companies and colleges in America). Often, they have their baseball hats on. They are reluctant to take off their backpacks, even wearing them while sitting down.\n\nDuring the exercise, it\u2019s important for someone to take the lead in embracing looking ridiculous. Big gestures and yelling loudly are very important: \u201cI HAVE FAILED!\u201d We stand on chairs. We might jump and pump our fists. Going around the circle, you see people calibrate how loud they feel they can allow themselves to be. But after this moment, the whole culture of the classroom transforms.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe \u201cI have failed\u201d exercise transforms their demeanor. Their posture shifts; they start looking each other in the eye. They smile more. They relax. The backpacks and hats come off. They feel freed.\n\nThe culture of tech does not trust anyone who is not comfortable with making mistakes. In planning All Star Code, I interviewed roughly 150 people, including people of color who were executives in tech or tech-enabled companies, and also people of color who were frustrated at their inability to break in.\n\nAnd yet based on my five years of developing a pipeline from high school into college and industry internships for young men of color, I think that one of the biggest obstacles to success for many African Americans and within other communities of color is the fear of failure that has been programmed into us by society. This has led to a reluctance within these communities to admit when you have made a mistake. But this covering up of problems is incompatible with tech\u2019s \u201cfail harder, fail fast\u201d culture and with the mentality that its job is to solve problems. You can\u2019t solve problems if you don\u2019t talk about them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe reason celebrating failure is such a powerful practice for lifelong learning is that it breaks the cycle. It provides the space for one to start talking about, reflecting on and learning from one\u2019s experience. What prevents people from actually learning from failure is the fear of failure itself.\n\nFor Each Failed Try, Clap for Yourself\n\nWith all due respect to Yoda, I think you have to try in order to do.\n\nThe next time you catch yourself obsessing over something that went wrong or worrying about something that could go wrong, try approaching it differently. Take a deep breath, mentally cheer for yourself and celebrate the fact that you are doing something difficult.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter you have felt your stress levels go down, smile, go and talk to someone, and share what you\u2019re struggling with. Believe it or not, that\u2019s the beginning of receiving the help you need.\n\nThe key is bringing yourself to a point where you risk failure. When you do that, you start truly daring greatly.\n\nCelebrating Failure: How It\u2019s Working\n\nAs proof, it\u2019s already working for our young men at All Star Code. Our students are 80 percent black or Latino, and 70 percent are eligible for free or reduced lunch. Yet virtually all of them matriculated to college, with 30 percent at top 100 national universities, and 85 percent majoring or minoring in computer science.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey are doing what so many others fail to do: getting hired (as software engineering interns) at Google, Facebook, JPMorgan Chase, NASA, Goldman Sachs and other top employers. They are not letting failure stop them, and they are not letting the fear of failure prevent them from trying.\n\nFollow our journey, and see the impact of celebrating failure by signing up for All Star Code\u2019s newsletter.\n\n", "keywords": ["students", "failure", "fear", "fail", "life", "try", "tech", "change", "star", "think", "color", "start", "celebrating"], "polarity": 0.022665721097398114, "subjectivity": 0.47767647811126024},

These things are $17.99 in Pittsburgh, but here it was 37 whole American dollars. Fuck that. I ended up just making a pillow out of an unopened pack of boxer briefs I brought with me. Yup, I\u2019m a grown-ass man, and I just slept on some drawers.)\n\nWhile I was in line, a 20-something white woman in front of me kept glancing back and smirking.

And I was just glad I turned my flash on.\n\nIn the last two weeks, I\u2019ve been in Miami, Baltimore, D.C. (twice) and now Birmingham. Along with the airports in those cities, I\u2019ve had layovers in Charlotte, N.C., and Atlanta. And in that 14-day span, I\u2019ve had five separate nonblack people (three white women, a white man and an Asian man) mention that I look like Khalid\u2014an artist I had to Google a few months ago after another white woman in Pittsburgh said I looked like him.

That they just see the similarities with our hair, our beards and our complexions, but what we actually look like just doesn\u2019t register. This would explain the other person white people frequently tell me I remind them of: Donald Glover. Which is even more perplexing for what I assume are very, very, very, very, very obvious reasons. (Also, it\u2019s interesting that both Khalid and Donald Glover are considerably smaller men than I am, which makes me wonder if white people just automatically assign an exaggerated physical size to black men. Which, again, makes me glad my phone has a flash function.)\n\nAnyway, most of the black people I\u2019ve shared this story with also have stories about white people stopping them to tell them they look like people.

But no one has quite come close to dragging him like actress Rose McGowan. McGowan was always vocal about sleazeballs like Weinstein, even prior to the New York Times and the New Yorker posting their explosive expos\u00e9s. But regarding this ordeal, she has emerged as a Katniss Everdeen of sorts, coming for every famous male actor who either dismissed her or did something trifling back in the day, too.\n\n\n\nObviously, I support this. Cis, straight, white male violence impacts us all, and I\u2019m all for that being dismantled and taken out. What I am not for is white women co-opting the struggles of black people\u2014black women specifically\u2014to do this. Which is why we are gathered here today.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite all the goodwill McGowan collected over the past couple of weeks, she managed to fuck that up in one week by tweeting out a now-deleted tweet that equated [white] women (because that\u2019s who she meant) with the premier slur for black people. This was her way of shaming James Corden for triflingly joking about the Harvey Weinstein scandal.\n\nShe, essentially, went full white feminist.\n\n\n\nOf course, this was expected. White women historically and embarrassingly continue to drop the intersectional ball. But even with that being the case, there are some other reasons that the fact that white feminism is rearing its basic-ass head this time around shouldn\u2019t be all that surprising:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. *That boycott* reinforced that solidarity really only is for white women.\n\nThis past week, before her horrendous tweet, McGowan was suspended from Twitter because of what some saw as her speaking out against the culture of silence that aggravated sexual violence in Hollywood\u2019s inner circle for decades. While she was reinstated later, cries to boycott the platform over her suspension rang out from a particular subset of Twitter (I\u2019ll let you guess who). The plan was for women to boycott Twitter for the day by not tweeting at all.\n\nI caught wind of this boycott Thursday evening (the night before) and briefly considered it when I thought: What sense does it make to protest being silenced ... by being silent? It sounds like some rhetorical circle jerk, but think about it: If the powers that be want you to shut the fuck up (especially in online spaces like Twitter), why would you do that? Why give them what they want?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo black femmes like me, it appeared to be counterintuitive, but also showed one thing:\n\n\n\nWhite women are often the only people who can afford to stay silent.\n\nThat silence was an option to begin with proved that point, but it also showed the immense cognitive dissonance white feminists display when they try to engage in matters of social justice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor black women, silence is often equatable to death. We go through enough silencing, suppression and harassment over our voices day in and day out (which I\u2019m about to get to). So who exactly thought it wise to tell us that we should totally volunteer to give up our voices for the day? Hmm?\n\nThankfully, our favorite social media superstar, April Reign, fixed that glaring oversight with an adjacent protest (#WOCAffirmation), but that still doesn\u2019t even begin to tackle the central issue many of us had with the boycott to begin with. Even if one were to excuse the method that was employed, there\u2019d still be one problem left:\n\nThe timing.\n\nIndeed. The whole reason I abstained from boycotting was the fact that I could not get behind the insulting transparency of taking up arms for Rose McGowan but leaving black women like Jemele Hill and Leslie Jones to be devoured by the wolves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth examples are painful reminders of what happens to black women who are loud and proud with their voices. Hill, a private citizen, was harassed by the White House\u2014by 45, the (unfortunate) president of the United States\u2014for correctly referring to him as a white supremacist. She was almost replaced at ESPN for her first \u201coffense\u201d and then unceremoniously suspended by the network for her \u201csecond\u201d offense.\n\nAnd while black women came out strong for her (as per usual), there were crickets from the same people who would have rioted for McGowan. No call for a Twitter boycott. No assistance from Twitter to stave off 45\u2019s attacks.\n\nBut that last part is unsurprising. Twitter has never cared about the harassment of black women on its platform. No, it would rather give us all 280 characters to waste and circular-profile pictures because why the fuck not?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd there\u2019s no greater example of this than Leslie Jones. After accepting what she thought was going to be a fun and harmless role in the Ghostbusters reboot, Jones endured harassment for months. This escalated and reached a fever pitch when Milo Yuckyanduntalented intentionally went after her.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m not gonna rehash everything she was called or likened to, but Twitter took no action until Jones herself retweeted and quoted-tweeted the harassment as a \u201cLOOK AT THIS SHIT\u201d tactic for someone to pay attention to.\n\nAfter days of the onslaught, Twitter finally (begrudgingly) banned Milo from Twitter. And even then, support didn\u2019t come for her until #LoveForLeslieJ was created by @MarsInCharge\u2014who is, wouldn\u2019t you know it, a black femme. And with that hashtag came the punctuation of an eternal point:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe only support that black women have in this world is the support that we give to one another and ourselves.\n\nAnd speaking of support for black women:\n\n2. McGowan\u2019s limp, disjointed, two-tweet \u201capology\u201d demonstrates a profound lack of intersectionality and proves that she cannot be bothered with either repentance or accountability.\n\nThere were some who held out hope (I was not one of them) that even with McGowan\u2019s fuck-ass tweet, she\u2019d own up to her gap in logic and apologize accordingly. This is not what happened. Instead, we got a painfully underdeveloped \u201capology\u201d split up in two pathetic tweets. One quite frankly blamed it on weed, and the other was her apologizing to \u201cany \u2018POC\u2019 that were offended.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQu\u00e9?\n\nI don\u2019t know this \u201cPOC\u201d to whom she is referring. I really don\u2019t. You know why? Because she didn\u2019t further marginalize, minimize or Columbus the struggle of \u201cPOC\u201d when she made her offending tweet. She further marginalized, minimized and Columbused the struggle of black people. Specifically black women ... who, for the last time, live at the intersection of both (hello, misogynoir).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRegarding McGowan\u2019s tweet, \u201cnigger\u201d is not a historical slur against \u201cPOC.\u201d It is a slur against black people. Black. People. Referring to white women as such is not only gross hyperbole but is fundamentally false. White women are not black and therefore will never know that struggle.\n\nEquating yourself to such because you have the misfortune of coming just below Chet Cheterson on the privilege pyramid does not a nigger make.\n\nPeriod.\n\nSo instead of co-opting the struggle of black people by making false equivalencies such as these, McGowan should have been preoccupied with putting in some damn work and finding some way to call out James Corden without throwing black women (and black people at large) under the bus. Again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut since that didn\u2019t happen, since she used the specific pain of black women to make that gross analogy, that same fucking specificity should have been employed to apologize to black women.\n\nNot \u201cPOC.\u201d Not \u201cWOC.\u201d Black women.\n\nIf McGowan can tweet that shit with her chest, she should be able to apologize with her chest, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd make no mistake.\n\nWhile I greatly empathize with McGowan\u2019s pain and the pain of any survivor (which was well-documented this past weekend with #MeToo), white feminists like her shouldn\u2019t let John Lennon and Yoko Ono get them fought.

It\u2019s a movie based on a story by Susan McMartin and the time she spent with her own real-life Mr. Church. It looked like a film where Eddie was playing a pantheon-level Magical Negro. I didn\u2019t see it back then and honestly forgot about its existence until Wednesday when I was perusing the Amazon Prime racks for something to watch.\n\nI saw Eddie Murphy\u2019s face on a movie and was like, \u201cHmm, I didn\u2019t realize he\u2019d released a movie so recently.\u201d I hit play and holy shit, bro, this is one of those movies where prospective Magical Negroes sit around and watch, take notes and then commiserate about how to up their Magical Negro-ness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike, right now, I could go outside, find me a white person, do the shit I saw in this movie, and I\u2019d bet a book would be written about how much of a better person I made them within six months. The lessons in Mr. Church have too much sauce. All shade aside, I actually enjoyed the movie; we all could use our own Mr. Church. Pretend that didn\u2019t sound slave-y.\n\nNot for nothing, but I\u2019d be really curious about the real Mr. Church\u2019s view of the movie and the story told of his life, though he passed on many years ago. Not that it\u2019s a bad one; it\u2019s just interesting. What makes Mr. Church a pantheon-level Magical Negro? A Magical Negro\u2019s Magical Negro? I\u2019m glad you asked. Here are 10 reasons:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. The entire premise of this movie is textbook Magical Negro-dom. A random black man shows up in the home of a white woman dying from breast cancer and her daughter to serve as their cook until the mother dies, projected to be in six months. I think the original title of the film was White Mom, Black Cook, but horny focus-group participants kept punching that into the search box on XVideos and it just got freaky.\n\nBack to the lecture at hand: Where does he come from? I haven\u2019t the foggiest. Some other person set the shit up. All we know is that he\u2019s there and the foods are going to get cooked come hell or high water. Also, he\u2019s been entreated with the responsibility of paying all of the bills from some mythical account for everything. Listen, while I\u2019d be leery if some random black man showed up to my house hovering over my not-quite-KitchenAid pots and pans, the minute he said, \u201cI got this, boo-boo\u201d as I looked at my Pepco bill, I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019d call him \u201cZaddy.\u201d\n\n2. When the mother lives an additional SIX YEARS, apparently, Mr. Magical Negro pays for all the bills out of his own pockets once that six-month fund runs low. How so? Well, in the FIRST place, he was offered a lifetime salary in exchange for cooking for six months, till the mother died. So, all that money he DID make when she lived? He poured right back into that household. Why for come? Because that\u2019s what a Magical Negro does; he fills a need where he sees one. Like reading to the mother nightly while she lay in bed searching for energy. Reading. Over and over. That\u2019s magic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. UPPING that ante, he goes to the supermarket one day and learns how much he saves by using coupons. Well, turns out he saves all of the savings over the course of the next, like, six or seven years, and when Charlie, the daughter, is all ready to go to college and gets into Boston University but can\u2019t afford it, there\u2019s Mr. Church right there with an envelope of all his coupon savings to cover her tuition. He gave her, like, $5,000. Do you know how much Hennessy he could have bought with $5,000? In 1977? But nope, he\u2019s here handing out magical envelopes. Of cash. To white teenagers. And cars.\n\n4. Here\u2019s part of his \u00fcber-magical nature: Charlie, the daughter who grows up and is who Mr. Church largely takes care of in life, hates reading books as a child. Especially books brought into her motherfucking establishment by some random black man who cooks delectable eats. Or, at least, she does at first. Over time, he introduces her to all the classics through his library system of having her check out books he brings over. She went from reading street signs to all of the classics. He gave her culture and depth. I salute you, Mr. Church.\n\n5. He always calls Charlie \u201cmy dear.\u201d It\u2019s reminiscent of The Princess Bride\u2019s Dread Pirate Roberts, aka Westley, and his constant refrain of \u201cas you wish\u201d to Princess Buttercup. Such a good movie. The Princess Bride, that is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. In true Magical Negro fashion, we never really learn much about Mr. Church\u2019s background until he dies. Turns out he was not only a great cook but also played the piano at a spot called Jelly\u2019s every weekend. In my mind, all Magical Negroes meet up at Jelly\u2019s on Sundays for brunch. His father was a horrible man and a mean cuss. But Mr. Church has always loved Charlie and her mother for giving him something he didn\u2019t have: a family. Which is Magical Negro parlance for, \u201cI\u2019ve never had one before.\u201d \u201cA room to yourself?\u201d \u201cA bed.\u201d [Half-smile.] Scene.\n\n7. Piggybacking on No. 6, Mr. Church has one rule: \u201cRespect his privacy.\u201d What does the white girl do? Charlie goes white girl and does not respect his privacy and digs and snoops through his shit and gets caught. And because Magical Negroes DO make mistakes on occasion\u2014he also often gets drunk when he\u2019s at Jelly\u2019s\u2014he puts her ass RIGHT out for snooping. But she\u2019s ALSO like hella pregnant and has nowhere to go, except to some store where some kid on a skateboard runs into her and her old friend from the neighborhood, Larson, happens to see her and gets her to the hospital, where Mr. Church magically shows up to claim her and bring her home.\n\n8. In what can only be described as a Magical Negro by Osmosis, it turns out that Larson was about to commit suicide with liquor and pills when Charlie got hit by the boy on a skateboard, and he had to help save her life, which, in turn, helped save his life. Mr. Church is out here saving white people by association.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. Charlie has her baby and then one of her former friends comes back into the picture and is now rich and snobby and Charlie wants to drop her as a friend. Mr. Church tells her not to get caught up in that shit. He\u2019s saving white relationships.\n\n10. Mr. Church ends up getting sick and dying and shit. Before he does that, though, he ends up teaching Charlie how to cook, play piano, garden, live, breathe, not die and ultimately be a good human. And he gave her the most important Magical Negro gift of all: She was able to write a story about him and became an author, thereby creating a job and livelihood by virtue of his very existence in her life.\n\nTo Mr. Church, a Magical Negro like no other.", "keywords": ["white", "magically", "negrod", "movie", "charlie", "church", "mother", "mr", "reasons", "negro", "does", "shit", "magical"], "polarity": 0.1633413283413283, "subjectivity": 0.5720266695266695},

I\u2019m one of those semi-road-warrior types who collects miles and points on my weekly trips in and around the United States to sit in meetings where I add marginal value, eat boxed lunches and internally critique PowerPoint font choices. I\u2019m TSA Precheck. I have airline status. I judge people\u2019s attire based on the ease with which they can pass through the security screening.\n\nLong story short, I spend a lot of time in airports. Honestly, I think airports are one of the truly fascinating places to people-watch because of the overall temporary nature of just about everyone there. Someone\u2019s leaving town, someone else is heading out on vacation. Another person just closed a deal, while the person beside them is hoping that they\u2019re gonna get that job. Interspersed in all of this are the people going to meet their grandkids for the first time and an occasional \u201cThis is my first time flying\u201d person.\n\nBut there we all are, together at the airport, traveling hither and yon, connected by a few minutes at the bar sipping our preferred form of preflight courage while checking smartphones and flight statuses and taking in the ever-ubiquitous presence of CNN on the airport TV screens.\n\nFor the most part, the conversations are benign:\n\n\u201cWhere ya headed?\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s home?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhaddya do?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow long ya going for?\u201d\n\n\n\nUsually it\u2019s brief, a chat with a few laughs, some minor discoveries about each other, and then someone hops off their stool, downs the rest of the IPA and hightails it off to the gate to make their flight to Phoenix or Tulsa, Okla., or Newark, N.J.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut as with any situation that involves booze, loose associations, acceptable generalizations, a somewhat diverse crowd and a TV screen showing a constant stream of CNN, sometimes the conversations can get a little contentious.\n\nA little while ago, I found myself in my usual spot at an airport bar after a long day of corporate tap dancing and professional mask-wearing, nursing a glass of Templeton Rye on the rocks and working my way through my usual grilled cheese sandwich with tomatoes, when I overheard two rather loud and somewhat intoxicated late-middle-aged white men accosting the TV screen and yammering on about that specific topic of the news and how that was specifically the thing that was destroying this country.\n\n\n\nI couldn\u2019t get the initial gist of their complaints, since I was kinda in my own world at the moment, but as I grasped what was on CNN and used context clues to put two and two together (shoutout to Ms. Pugh-Scott\u2019s second-grade class, y\u2019all), I realized that these men had been whipped into a frothy tirade over immigration. Namely, the fact that \u201ceveryone\u201d seemed so afraid to call these countries where all these immigrants and \u201cillegals\u201d (their words, not mine) came from the veritable \u201cshitholes\u201d that they are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSee, we used to call it the \u2018Third World,\u2019 and it was, you know, countries that might\u2019ve been poor or not as sophisticated as us, and so we wanted to reach out to them, maybe train some doctors from there, teach some of their folks how we do business here, and then they were supposed to go back home to build their own damn countries!\u201d\n\n\u201cYep. These people keep staying here because they know they don\u2019t want to go back to those Third World countries. But instead of going home and helping their own people, they wanna use chain migration and bring their brothers and sisters and all their kids, and eventually we got the whole damn village to support with OUR tax dollars. It\u2019s bullshit, if you ask me.\u201d\n\nAt that moment, I knew I should have just minded my own business, but the way my woke is set up, I couldn\u2019t let it pass without saying something. See, I come from an immigrant family myself, and as a Liberian, I know the Trump administration rescinded temporary protected status for many of my family and countrymen last May. My wife is an immigrant, as are her parents, and so our children are the only members of our family born in America. I work at a company full of immigrants. Hell, I had the self-awareness to see that the bartenders at the airport and the people running the food were also immigrants.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut here we were, with me now forced to speak up in the face of willful ignorance and Fox News talking points with facts, logic and reason that these men were too old, too drunk and too white to accept. The irony notwithstanding that, in their defense of their own bigotry and self-serving view of Americanness, they shamelessly referenced the corpses of their own immigrant ancestors as if they had arrived on these shores welcomed with open arms and personally ready to start the tech companies and hedge funds of their day.\n\n\n\nAs the conversation teetered dangerously close to me having to call them the nativist racists that they were, and as the bar staff was becoming visually uncomfortable with their characterizations of \u201cthose Latinos,\u201d God intervened with an announcement that the flight to Dallas (or Houston, or Little Rock, Ark., or just generically Dixieland) was boarding and they ambled off their stools, shook my hand, and we wished each other safe travels. I mean, fuck those guys, but I\u2019m pretty sure everyone on their flight wasn\u2019t racist, and I wouldn\u2019t want them to suffer the karmic repercussions of the dumbass opinions of those two assholes.\n\nBut somehow, it got worse.\n\nAfter those men left, a youngish white couple, male and female, dressed in their vacation clothes, who had been sitting there all along, decided to chime in. But to, like, thank me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, my God. We heard what was going on over there, and it\u2019s just so refreshing to see someone actually, like, you know, speak up against those kinds of people.\u201d\n\nYeah, I mean, thanks, I guess, but that actually pissed me off even more: the fact that I, as the aggrieved party, had to speak up for myself and by extension those similarly situated around me (who were in no position to say anything), while Tad and Becca sat on the sidelines and offered only silence as support. I\u2019m sure that in their minds and in the story they\u2019d tell about the incident, they were on the right side of the argument and would pat themselves on the back for not sharing the opinions of the other two men at that bar.\n\nWhite people who want to be \u201callies\u201d need to understand that their agreement isn\u2019t enough. It\u2019s not enough for you to nod while I defend myself, or to bristle when something offensive is said or done to a member of a minority or marginalized community. Nah. There\u2019s just not enough of us to fight this battle alone, and if white people want to prove their worth in the struggle, they\u2019re going to need to speak the fuck up at the exact moment of the offense.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOtherwise, it\u2019s just a different form of complicity. It\u2019s the decision to choose your own comfort over the discomfort of others. It\u2019s the purest form of privilege, and it needs to be treated with the same derision as abject and active racism. Otherwise, you\u2019re not an ally; you\u2019re just another enemy. You gotta pick a side and then you gotta actually work. Complicity is more dangerous than any outwardly racist act.\n\n\n\nOn the bright side, they did pay for my Templeton Rye on the rocks and my grilled cheese sandwich, so I guess they weren\u2019t all bad.", "keywords": ["white", "dont", "im", "airport", "going", "speak", "flight", "world", "work", "enemies", "know", "men", "allies", "need"], "polarity": 0.05962957875457874, "subjectivity": 0.4479105616605617},

You\u2019re a black woman. So, to do that, you\u2019ll have to work twice as hard to get half as far.\u201d\n\nHowever, the onus isn\u2019t just on us. There are two things tech must acknowledge and fix to make change:\n\n1. \u201cPipeline issues\u201d ignore the 6,000 black STEM graduates, from bachelor degrees to Ph.D.s, and 200,000 black college graduates annually.\n\nThe problem is tech\u2019s belief that it is a meritocratic industry. It is an oligarchy, rife with privilege, with heaping sides of favoritism and nepotism. It isn\u2019t about who you know, it\u2019s who knows you. Roughly 52 percent of tech employees are referred by employees. The average tech employee is a cookie-cutter version of the person who referred him or her, promoting homogeny of ethnic backgrounds, class, age and hobbies. This model ensures \u201cfit,\u201d which can be a candidate barrier in itself, even with stellar qualifications. You\u2019re a black engineer with Harvard and Stanford degrees? No matter, because you don\u2019t enjoy artisan candles, Burning Man, microbreweries and the DNCE album.\n\n\n\nThe black tech employee isn\u2019t immune. She or he is a Carlton Banks composite: usually a graduate of Stanford, Berkeley or an Ivy League school (including graduate degree), raised in a middle- to upper-class family, who wears the finest of J. Crew fashions. To be truly diverse, include diversity within the Diaspora.\n\n\n\nWhat tech can do: Tech companies must expand recruitment activities to schools outside their comfort zones. While Morehouse, Spelman, Howard, Hampton and Florida A&M have some name recognition in mainstream circles, what about North Carolina A&T? Your loss, tech. The school leads the nation in the number of undergraduate engineering degrees awarded to blacks, according to Diverse Issues in Higher Education magazine, and holds the No. 3 spot for doctoral degrees awarded to blacks in engineering. Other schools with great engineering programs include Tuskegee, Southern and Morgan State.\n\n\n\nTech companies must holistically assess candidates\u2019 qualifications. There\u2019s a story behind the r\u00e9sum\u00e9. A candidate with a slightly lower GPA than desired, but who worked while in college, demonstrates great work ethic and the ability to multitask. No computer science degree? Most black engineers receive mechanical or electrical engineering degrees, which are deemed not as marketable at tech companies. However, engineering is about how you learn, think and problem-solve. That is directly transferable. Because we\u2019re indoctrinated to work twice as hard for half as much, we\u2019ll often do more for less (though we shouldn\u2019t), can stretch thin resources and use that spirit to solve problems others haven\u2019t even identified yet.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLastly, fun fact: Fifty percent of tech company\u2019s jobs are not in the areas of science, technology, engineering or mathematics. Every company needs personnel in accounting, legal, policy, marketing, sales and partnerships. Think about the demographic that drives the culture forward\u2014from fashion and music to language and social movements\u2014and then really consider who\u2019ll you hire to create your ad campaigns, handle your public relations and social media accounts, and what partnerships are clutch to drive revenue. Remember who accounts for $1.25 trillion in spending power while setting the world on fire. What we do, the world follows. That all adds up. Get money or get left behind. Your move, tech industry.\n\n\n\nWhat you can do: Be seen. People, by nature, tend to self-segregate. When it comes to employment and investing opportunities, people will reach out to who they know to offer said opportunities. This means the onus is on us to broaden our circles. For tech circles, this means you need to attend meet-ups, join coding classes and attend conferences. SXSW is a huge tech conference that offers organic opportunities to meet people, learn about new opportunities, or create one of your own. Start small and attend a Startup Grind event in your city. Blavity puts on both the EmpowerHer conference in the summer and AfroTech in the fall, with a black tech crowd.\n\n\n\n2. If you build it, they won\u2019t necessarily come, or they will come reluctantly.\n\nSilicon Valley is not the most hospitable place. The cities for tech work in the area\u2014San Jose, Mountain View, Menlo Park and San Francisco\u2014are not diverse areas. A community will never feel like home if you can\u2019t find somewhere to get your haircut, some non-Neiman Marcus greens, a communal gathering place for your people or a dating pool.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat tech can do: In order to change this, tech first has to acknowledge that its main location isn\u2019t one where black folks want to live. To combat that, it needs to consider branching out to cities with larger, diverse populations\u2014Los Angeles and Oakland in California, Atlanta, New York City, Philadelphia, Houston, Washington, D.C., and Charlotte, N.C., are all good places to start.\n\nWhat you can do: Be open to moving. I know. The idea of living in San Francisco for the fabulous startup job of your dreams is daunting when you think about the city having a 5 percent black population and rent the equivalent of a Tesla payment. Just know that there are others doing the same, and they are building community through kinship with co-workers.\n\n\n\nFinally, let\u2019s talk about inclusion. Diversity is fine, but that\u2019s getting people the job and often underpaid and under-leveled. According to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, less than 1 percent of Silicon Valley management is black. We won\u2019t mention board members. People of color in tech leave the field at more than 3.5 times the rate of white men. We\u2019re promoted less quickly and paid less than white peers. If there isn\u2019t true inclusion\u2014opportunity for growth, prominent projects and leadership roles\u2014people leave. You can only pay someone for complacency for so long. Diversity gets people in the door; inclusion keeps them there.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nB\u00e4r\u00ed A. Williams, Esq., is the Head of Business Operations, North America at StubHub.

In Rosepine, they love Jesus, Trump, troops and flags (both the Confederate and star-spangled variety).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack people? Not so much.\n\nOn Friday, Sept. 29, the North Central Hurricanes of Lebeau, La., traveled 95 miles west to face the Rosepine Eagles football team. North Central is a small school whose student body is 74 percent black and 25 percent white, according to Public School Review\u2019s 2015 statistics (the latest available). By comparison, Rosepine High School is 86 percent white and only 6 percent black, Public School Review\u2019s 2015 stats show.\n\nAccording to a story in Pen Point News and The Root\u2019s reporting, when the mostly black North Central Eagles took the field against the majority-white Rosepine Eagles, at least one of North Central\u2019s African-American players had already decided to kneel during the playing of the national anthem to protest racial injustice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of North Central\u2019s students wrote on his Twitter account days before playing at Rosepine: \u201ceven myself being a young man i know about injustice that goes on in this country, which is why i # TakeTheKnee before every football game.\u201d\n\nThat student, away from home, playing against a majority-white town, watched the Rosepine players burst onto the field for homecoming carrying American flags, and as the Rosepine team played the national anthem, he stuck to his convictions and took a knee.\n\nThat did not sit well with the Rosepine crowd.\n\nMaybe I should mention how much the people of Rosepine love the flag, again. It\u2019s a little bit creepy. In researching this story, I checked out half the townspeople\u2019s social media and spoke to several people in Rosepine. I mean, it borders on pornographic. Is there such a thing as \u201cflagophiles\u201d? People who want to make sweet love to the Stars and Stripes? Seriously, y\u2019all, the way they talk about the flag, you\u2019d think it had titties or something.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring the second half of the game, the student who took a knee said a referee told him to \u201cnot come back, nigger.\u201d He said he immediately went to the sidelines and informed his coach. One of the North Central parents in attendance said that after the game, people in the Rosepine crowd followed the team to the bus, hurling racial slurs, including \u201cbitches\u201d and \u201cniggers,\u201d and throwing rocks at the bus as they drove off.\n\nAfter the game, one of the teenagers who knelt during the anthem wrote the following on Facebook:\n\n[I]n Rosepine, La i experienced racism first hand and it was from a referee, what i was told was to \u201cnot come back nigger\u201d only hearing about it, i never experienced that and didn\u2019t know what to even say, of course i informed my coach...but this right here is the reason why i kneel, because of this type of treatment to young African Americans, and what makes matters worst is that it\u2019s coming from someone who is supposed to \u201cofficiate\u201d the game we all love....and I\u2019ll continue to kneel\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, in the flag-crazy town of Rosepine, people seemed to be OK with how everything went. (Did I mention their love for the flag? I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve stressed how much they really love the flag. I bet when it rains on hot summer days, the guys in Rosepine take that warm, moist American flag, fold it and ... You know what? I\u2019ve probably said too much.)\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Root contacted the teams\u2019 league, the Louisiana High School Athletic Association, via email on its website to obtain the identity of the referee and to seek comment, but didn\u2019t hear back by time of publication.\n\nListen to Pen Point News interview one of the parents in attendance below:\n\nRead more at Pen Point News.", "keywords": ["flag", "high", "fans", "referee", "anthem", "game", "players", "black", "say", "north", "nword", "opposing", "kneeling", "school", "football", "love", "central", "rosepine"], "polarity": 0.01900067069081154, "subjectivity": 0.39481835457187564},

My wife and I drove to Washington, D.C., after biking from Pittsburgh to Cumberland, Md., on a four-day and 150-mile trek that I still plan to write about eventually, but remain too traumatized by to write about yet.\n\nWe arrived Saturday evening, went out and stayed the night with the friends we made the bike trip with, and had all of Sunday in D.C. before flying back to Pittsburgh Monday morning. We decided to try to visit \u201cthe Blacksonian\u201d since neither of us had been.\n\nBut, as we quickly learned, if you\u2019re not on any waiting lists (and we weren\u2019t), the only way to get same-day tickets is to get up at the butt crack of dawn and check online (which we didn\u2019t do). Plus, it was the Sunday before Labor Day, which meant the National Mall would be even busier than usual, and any chance of scoring walk-up tickets would be scarce.\n\nRunning out of options, I made a Facebook status about our predicament and asked if anyway knew of any other way. Luckily, one of my friends messaged me that veterans can get into Smithsonian museums whenever they want, and since her dad is a vet, he\u2019d meet us there and get us in.\n\nI connected with her dad and agreed to meet him in front of the museum at 3 p.m. When I asked how we\u2019d know it was him, he replied in a typical 75-year-old black-man way: \u201cYou won\u2019t miss me. I\u2019ll be the handsomest man there.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, he was right. We saw him near the entrance where we agreed to meet. Decked out in an exquisitely tailored charcoal-gray suit, black-and-gray oxfords and a burgundy bowtie, he immediately reminded me of Ossie Davis.\n\nWe introduced ourselves, shook his hand and thanked him, and he replied, \u201cNot a problem. It\u2019s my pleasure.\u201d\n\nWe spoke for a couple more minutes, and we learned that he\u2019d just left church and post-church brunch with his family\u2014which is probably why he was so extra-super sharp\u2014and that he fulfills this request for people frequently. When we apologized for interrupting his day, he corrected us: \u201cNo. I consider this a duty.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen you enter the Blacksonian, the guides suggest that you start at the basement (which is where the time spanning the trans-Atlantic slave trade is documented and displayed) and work your way back up to the top floor. The museum was packed, so we had to wait in line to get on an elevator that would take us down there. There were a few dozen people in front of us, but the line moved swiftly and efficiently, and we were on the elevator within 10 minutes.\n\nThe basement was everything you\u2019d expect an entire floor devoted to the hundreds of years that black people were in bondage in America would be. It was fucking heavy. And hard. And scary. And sad. Even now, six months after I was on that floor, the thought of it heats and wells my eyes. Some people were crying. Others just staring, silent and blank and sad and seething, at the exhibits. Some of those who brought young children were attempting to educate them while also visibly fighting the urge not to be overcome by emotion. And everyone was respectful of the weight and the temperature of that room.\n\n\n\nWell, mostly everyone.\n\nThe crowd was maybe 70 percent percent black. And those who didn\u2019t happen to be black appeared to be just as moved by what was being experienced. But there was one 40-something white man there who, on at least three separate occasions, bumped into other museumgoers while he was attempting to take pictures and text.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey weren\u2019t egregious or violent bumps; he didn\u2019t knock anyone off balance. But they were the type of bumps where you\u2019d look up after being bumped because you\u2019d expect that person to stop what he was doing and apologize. Which is exactly what each person did after being bumped.\n\nNo apology came, however, as this guy was too transfixed with his phone to even notice. In a different environment, this type of social faux pas around black people would have induced at least a couple of \u201cUm. Excuse you\u201ds. Instead, he was just met by head shakes and looks of disgust. They weren\u2019t going to let him ruin their experience.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, I joined my friend Deesha Philyaw onstage at the Summit Against Racism for a talk titled, \u201cHow Not to Be a Racist Shithead.\u201d For 45 minutes, we addressed the predominantly white audience of 300, and basically just spent our time finding different ways to say, \u201cWhite people, you need to do better.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToward the end of our talk, I brought up the idea that white people need to learn how to be guests. If you are in someone else\u2019s house and they ask you to take off your shoes before stepping onto their floor, you take off your shoes. And if you are the type of person who usually wears shoes without socks, do your research and put some fucking socks on before you leave your house.\n\nIt\u2019s a concept many white people seem to struggle with. That not all things are theirs. And that some things will never have owners because they cannot be owned. And some things belong to other people. And whether those things are dialects or music or histories or actual bodies, that a proper reverence for them must be possessed before engaging with them.\n\nWhen thinking about this, I can\u2019t help thinking about that day at the Blacksonian. And all of the things we had to do that day just to get tickets. And that beautiful man helping us out, as he\u2019s helped others, because he knows how important it is for that space to be witnessed and experienced. And the rows of (mostly black) people, waiting patiently and anxiously to be taken to a floor displaying the horrors our ancestors were forced through. And the faces of the people engaging with those exhibits. The sadness and the anger and the shock.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then this white guy, either oblivious to or just not giving a shit about his surroundings, bumping into people.

On Wednesday, after tens of thousands of students walked out of schools across the nation in solidarity with Douglas High students\u2014and to protest negligent and reckless gun laws that place their lives at risk every single day\u2014I sat in the parking lot of a Baskin-Robbins trying to teach my son, who is on spring break, how to survive an encounter with public servants who are sworn to keep him safe.\n\n\n\nSome of the white Douglas students have voiced similar, if not identical, thoughts: For the first time, they feel unsafe in supposedly safe places. For the first time, they realize that the U.S. government does not value their lives over guns. For the first time, they feel compelled to stand up, walk out and demand change, because they know their lives depend on it.\n\n\n\nNot for the first time, I wondered where in the world is safe for my sons.\n\n\n\nIt is not in schools where they can be beaten to death and rolled up in a gym mat, their assailants never brought to justice.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is not in schools where security officers can violently flip them over in their desks.\n\n\n\nIt is not in schools where white predators can sexually assault them in the locker room and hurl racist slurs at them in the classroom.\n\n\n\nIt is not in schools where white teens can lynch them and law enforcement protects their white supremacist attackers.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is not in schools where black students face discriminatory punitive action.\n\n\n\nThey are not safe in parks.\n\n\n\nThey aren\u2019t safe walking home.\n\n\n\nThey aren\u2019t safe swimming.\n\n\n\nThey aren\u2019t safe listening to music.\n\n\n\nThey aren\u2019t safe leaving a party.\n\nThey aren\u2019t safe sleeping in their homes.\n\nThey aren\u2019t safe asking for help.\n\nAnd as we witnessed with the peaceful protests in the wake of Baltimore police officers leaving Freddie Gray\u2019s neck nearly severed from his spine, without the canopy of whiteness, my sons aren\u2019t safe organizing walkouts to protest state-sanctioned violence and injustice, either.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll of the students around the country\u2014including the black and brown students in Broward County, Fla., who walked out Wednesday\u2014are doing something revolutionary. Despite allegedly being mocked and threatened by some so-called educators for walking out, they continued to stand their ground. They continued to demand that their safety be prioritized, and they have taken to the streets to do so.\n\n\n\nStill, many people have asked the question: Where was the outpouring of public support when black children were being teargassed in Ferguson, Mo.? We have wondered how Oprah Winfrey dared to call the Douglas students \u201cfreedom riders\u201d when she had nothing but criticism for Black Lives Matter. We listened as former President Barack Obama said that these students are whom the nation has been waiting for, that he had their backs. As if black youths have not been risking their lives to protest the state-sanctioned gun violence of police with no unequivocal support from the White House. As if some of the Douglas students have not credited the Black Lives Matter movement as the blueprint for their fight against injustice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is a reason that BLM can serve as the blueprint: because whiteness is the monster that stalks us, haunts us, kills us all\u2014just some more than others. Still, there has been no reckoning with white, male violence, slightly more emphasis placed on male. We know that with mass murder, particularly in public places, the shooters are overwhelmingly white, cisgender, heterosexual men, some with a history of intimate-partner and family violence. We know that they have been neurodiverse, meaning that neither mental illness nor mental disability has been a determining factor across the board, despite the ableist fearmongering that would warn us otherwise.\n\nAs for school shooters specifically, most have been white boys or white men\u2014approximately 90 percent\u2014so if we know one thing, it should be this: We cannot afford to divorce whiteness from any conversation around gun violence. We cannot erase police officers from conversations around school and gun violence.\n\nDeep down, we know that all children don\u2019t matter in this great, white nation of ours, even though our children matter to us. We know that when our children go to school, the violence is already lurking inside the walls.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet here we are, rightfully cheering on the beauty of this movement, marveling at the power of it, holding on to what feels like tide-shifting change. Hoping against hope that this time, unlike Sandy Hook, legislators might be so moved by the bodies of slain white children that they pass laws to keep all of our children safe when they walk through doors to learn\u2014doors where, almost 60 years ago, black children had to face white supremacist violence just to enter.\n\nI, as have many people, cried as I saw children of all races and ethnicities take to the streets without militarized police and dogs breathing down their necks.

That can\u2019t be right) examined a variety of studies on gun ownership, including a 2017 study by sociologists at Baylor University. Titled \u201cGun Culture in Action,\u201d the researchers created a \u201cgun-empowerment scale\u201d to study the habits and create a profile of the average gun owner.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat they found was startling. (And by \u201cstartling,\u201d I mean it reflected what people like Very Smart Brothas\u2019 Damon Young have been saying all along. So ... not startling.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter studying a representative cross section of gun owners, researchers found that the people who have an emotional attachment to their guns were 78 percent white and 65 percent male. It must be noted that the sample size was small because\u2014despite widespread American gun ownership\u2014just 3 percent of the population owns half the guns in the country.\n\nRacial anxiety was a big reason for the uptick in gun ownership, according to Angela Stroud, a Northland College sociologist. Stroud went through concealed-weapon applications in Texas and interviewed applicants. She found that many of them wanted to protect their loved ones during the impending race war.\n\nApparently, Barack Obama came to the secret black meeting and told black people to attack the whites. (Wait ... you missed the meeting? It was great. Especially the catering. Best watermelon and Kool-Aid I ever tasted.) According to the report:\n\n... Stroud also discovered another motivation: racial anxiety. \u201cA lot of people talked about how important Obama was to get a concealed-carry license: \u2018He\u2019s for free health care, he\u2019s for welfare.\u2019 They were asking, \u2018Whatever happened to hard work?\u201d Obama\u2019s presidency, they feared, would empower minorities to threaten their property and families.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere are some of the more notable characteristics of the typical, emotionally attached gun owner:\n\nThey are less educated: According to Pew Research, about 26 percent of white college graduates own guns, compared with 40 percent of high school graduates and 42 percent of people with some college education. There is no significant difference in the rate of gun ownership across educational attainment among nonwhites.\n\n\n\nAccording to Pew Research, about 26 percent of white college graduates own guns, compared with 40 percent of high school graduates and 42 percent of people with some college education.

Pew Research shows that a larger percentage of blacks have been threatened with a firearm or know someone who has been shot, but white men are more likely to say they need a gun for protection. And while most blacks find gun violence to be a problem in their community, most Republicans say more guns would lead to less crime.\n\nSo there you have it. White men need guns to pretect them from the evil Negro monsters roaming the country.

{"url": "https://verysmartbrothas.theroot.com/100-days-as-a-black-man-in-silicon-valley-1822522889", "title": "/100-days-as-a-black-man-in-silicon-valley-", "text": "My mother moved from Jamaica to America to start a new life. My deceased father was the first in his family to go to college, yet he became the first Black to get a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from Georgia Tech. He also has three patents for fiber optic cables. My younger brother started his own company. I, too, wanted to create something, so I quit at my law firm, sold my dream car, and moved to the land of creation: Silicon Valley.\n\nThe first thing I had to do was find a place to stay. I found it very difficult to schedule viewings from Atlanta, so I visited for a week in December to lock down a place. I didn\u2019t know much about the plethora of neighborhoods, so I decided to stay as close to public transportation as possible. After much sorting through Craigslist, I found a nice Jewish woman in Noe Valley who is renting her son\u2019s room while he\u2019s away at college. However, her room did not become available until Valentine\u2019s Day, so I had to book a room on Airbnb for the first six weeks.\n\nI arrived in San Francisco (I know it\u2019s not Silicon Valley, but it\u2019s my article and makes for a better title) on January 4, 2015 and immediately went into hustle mode. My objective was to attend one event per night. I\u2019ll never forget that on January 8, 2015, I attended a tech networking event, and when I went to check in, the woman said, \u201cYou know this is a tech event, right?\u201d Obviously, she hadn\u2019t met many Black people who were interested in tech. And she is not alone.\n\nSay what you want about the South, but at least people have been exposed to Blacks in all fields. For many in San Francisco, however, the only Blacks they are used to seeing hang around the Tenderloin. And if you\u2019ve never been to the Tenderloin, don\u2019t be fooled by the name \u2014 there\u2019s nothing tender about it. The Tenderloin, or the TL, is basically Hamsterdam from The Wire. I am convinced everything is legal there. And I mean everything.\n\nThe defining part about the Tenderloin is the homeless population. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it before in any city I\u2019ve ever visited or lived in. The only thing more gut-wrenching than the fact that many\u2014 dare I say most\u2014 of them are Black is the fact that so many rich people live here. The homeless problem is so bad that most have become desensitized to it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll that is to say, people in SF seem a little surprised to see a Black man who looks just like them?\u2014?full beard, hoodie, messenger bag, and Nike running shoes. I\u2019ve received those looks in other cities when I\u2019m wearing a suit, but no one has ever looked at me in amazement for wearing street clothes until I moved to SF.\n\nDressing the part isn\u2019t always enough to neutralize the \u201cthreat\u201d of being Black. I was walking through the Mission in broad daylight in my SF attire and saw an older White man and his wife leave a restaurant and walk up to their Tesla Model S. I asked him if he had a rare 40 kWh like the one I owned because I did not see a 60 or 85 decal on the back. I could tell he thought I was going to rob him. Needless to say, we didn\u2019t talk for long.\n\nHowever, the vast majority of people have been warm and welcoming because networking is key to survival. I know very few people who have lived in SF for more than five years, so everyone is trying to build their network. Also, people empathize with my story of quitting a job to move to San Francisco (could I have been any more cliche?). In addition to the traditional mediums, people here even network in a Lyft Line or UberPool. The ability to network is imperative because internal referrals make it easier to get hired and jobs for early-stage startups are essentially word-of-mouth only.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite many people only wanting to connect on a surface level, I have made some actual friends. I actually befriended a White guy at the same January 8 networking event who took me sailing and surfing for the first time. And I made two Black friends who are recruiters at tech companies while watching March Madness at a restaurant. Chance encounters like these happen all the time in SF.\n\nIn addition to it being easy to meet people because people like networking in SF, there\u2019s just more to do in this 7 x 7 mile city. There\u2019s always free events, such as movie screenings, art shows, app launch parties, and waffle giveaways going on. My favorite thing to do is attend concerts. Fortunately, SF is one of the few cities to have Jukely Unlimited, a service that provides unlimited concerts for $25/month.\n\nI\u2019ve seen everyone from Asgeir to Catfish and the Bottlemen to JMSN to Flight Facilities through the service. I didn\u2019t expect to see many Black people at any of those shows. I was, however, a little surprised that there were few Blacks when I went to see Just Blaze in SF or Prhyme in Oakland. I\u2019ve quickly learned there\u2019s no de facto critical mass of Black people in the Bay Area. If you\u2019re Black and want to meet people who look like you, you have to plan in advance because we are so spread out (see, Our Family Dinner, infra).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNotice that I italicized the phrase \u201cand want to meet people who look like you.\u201d There are two types of Black people in tech: Black people who\u2019d prefer to see more Blacks in tech and Black people who\u2019d prefer to remain a unicorn. It\u2019s really easy to spot the difference. As stated above, people love networking in SF, even people with poor social skills. So, if meet someone and invite them to coffee or lunch and they make no attempt to even put a date on a calendar, I leave them alone.\n\nOther than the crabs in a bucket, I have no problem with Black people in the Bay Area. Blacks in Oakland frequently question why I would live in SF with people who don\u2019t look like me. I\u2019m not concerned about the racial makeup of my community. I care more about living in the center of the action, especially while I am looking for a job. To me, SF is worth the premium price and colder weather.\n\nDespite the longstanding dissension between Black in the Bay \u2014 at least from what I gleaned from a visit the African American Museum and Library in Oakland \u2014 I believe the Black professional community is very strong here. Black professionals in Atlanta often take our numbers for granted. Here, however, I was placed on a Young Blacks in San Francisco listserv before I even moved here. And I was one of hundreds of people who paid nearly $50 to meet other Blacks in the Bay at the \u201cOur Family Dinner\u201d event on February 21. Some attended to find a significant other (I actually know a married couple who met at a prior OFD) while others went to network.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI do not care how connected you are, it is not easy to find a job in tech, especially if you do not know how to code. It\u2019s extremely competitive out here because you are competing with people from around the world. I moved here for legal or policy counsel positions with a tech company and/or startup. Positions with early-stage startups generate a lot of interest because of the possibility of equity in the next Facebook. Equity would be ideal, but I care more about using my legal and policy expertise to help grow a business, even if it is already public.\n\nThus far, I have had interviews for legal counsel with Skycatch, a drone startup, and the Wikimedia Foundation (nonprofit that runs Wikipedia). Words cannot express how grateful I am to even have made it to the interview process. I did not get either job, but I do not think it was because of my race. My gut feeling with Skycatch is that I wasn\u2019t hired because of my litigation background and they were looking for someone with more transactional experience. And I didn\u2019t feel good about the Wikipedia interview.\n\nI honestly feel like going to school in the South is a bigger strike against me than my race. People are aware that UNC-Chapel Hill is a great college, but few realize the University of Georgia is a Top 30 law school and Top 5 for my master\u2019s program. I even had to revise my resume to add the U.S. News rankings because I felt like I was getting overlooked by people who attended West Coast institutions. Unlike going to public institutions in the South, racial diversity can be seen as a good thing. Indeed, Apple just donated over $50 million to get more minorities and women into tech. Venture capitalist Ben Horowitz also has been actively working to increase the number of Black founders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI also know that working at boutique firm is a strike against me. When companies say they want someone who works at a \u201ctop\u201d law firm, they mean a large law firm. However, it\u2019s a known fact that associates at smaller firms have more autonomy and responsibility than people at large firms. In fact, my old firm only hired former federal law clerks for its litigation team. I don\u2019t know of any large firm whose standards are that high.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, there is a force to keep certain people out of tech, but I believe the problem is worse in private companies. In fact, at the Crunchies (think the Oscars for tech), a startup founder\u2019s wife told me that many investors will not invest in a company if there are too many non-Asian minorities and women at the company. I\u2019m sure Ellen Pao would agree with regard to discrimination against women. For Blacks in tech, we can only aspire to become Tristan Walker. And if you don\u2019t know who that is, you\u2019ve just proven my point (no hyperlink, google him for yourself).\n\nThe ironic thing is that despite meeting many people who fit the \u201cfounder profile\u201d (white and Asian men), I haven\u2019t met many people with truly disruptive business models. Rather, they just want to piggyback off something that has been done before (\u201cMy startup is like [insert successful company], but [insert meaningless distinction]\u201d). Not to toot my own horn, but I have good startup ideas. I just don\u2019t code well enough to build them by myself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s precisely why there\u2019s a premium for engineers out here. A guy who used to work for Lyft told me that there was a $1,000 finder\u2019s fee for new employees, but $10,000 if you were an engineer. Kind of makes me wish I did not go to law school \u2026 or college for that matter. Seriously, why pay all that money for college when you can go to coding school for a fraction of the price, make over six figures, and get equity in a company? I definitely feel like my high school guidance counselor dropped the ball on that one.\n\nCoding is a language that should be taught in every school. Sadly, coding courses are not available at many schools, including ones in SF. That\u2019s why I gladly accepted a position on the board of Mission Bit, a nonprofit that teaches coding to public high school students.\n\nOf course, when you take tech out of the equation SF, is just like any other city. The weather is much different from the South. People back East tend to think of California as a whole, but the weather in Northern California is much different from Southern California. In fact, with the microclimates in SF, the weather can be significantly different just one mile away. The weather is dramatically warmer if you go to East or South Bay.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe next thing to surprise me is the difference in how women look. It\u2019s not uncommon to see women in full club attire at the Lenox Mall in Atlanta. The other end of the spectrum is SF, where many women seem to wear fairly androgynous clothing. Of course, women in San Francisco dress up, but it\u2019s reserved for special occasions, Temple Nightclub, and the Marina District (still haven\u2019t been to verify).\n\nThe last thing to surprise me has been the Christian community. Growing up, I expected to find nothing but \u201cGodless heathens\u201d in SF. In the \u201cBible Belt,\u201d people often claim to be Christian because it is part of the culture. Here, however, being Christian isn\u2019t as ingrained in the culture, so you have to be more intentional with it.\n\nThe churches I\u2019ve been to here also seem to be very involved in the community, especially with helping the poor. In fact, the first civic organization I joined was a YWAM Tenderloin ministry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHomeless people need more than a meal or some money. They need people who are willing to make a long-term investment. And I intend on being here for the long haul. I\u2019ve had some life-changing experiences in SF, but nothing has been more transformative than walking around the Tenderloin at night and handing out hot chocolate to homeless people with YWAM. We engaged with people by learning their life stories, shaking hands, giving a hug of encouragement, and praying for them, if they requested it. That\u2019s what Christ requires of his followers, yet I had never even had an actual conversation with a homeless person until I ventured to the land of Godless heathens. Ironic, indeed.\n\nI visited Atlanta during Easter weekend and was angry for most of the time. I was angry that my mom lived so far from the city. I was angry that it was difficult to walk around Midtown. When I got to Midtown, I parked my car in a surface lot and was determined to walk as much as possible. After making a few stops to see friends, I eventually made it out as far as General Assembly at Ponce City Market (about 2.3 miles from where I parked). I then was angry that the tech networking event at General Assembly was overrun by people who were only there for the free beer.\n\nI get angry in SF, too. I saw a quote at the African American museum from Rep.

Prescott decision, The Root has decided to print the full decision as well as the minority opinion.\n\nStatement of Facts:\n\nOn July 4, 2016, at a family barbecue, Keisha Prescott was engaged in a spades match with her cousin James \u201cJ-Mac\u201d McDaniel. They were battling Keisha\u2019s aunt Margaret Parnell and her uncle Manuel Prescott (heretofore referred to by his more accepted moniker, \u201cMan Man.\u201d) Records show that \u201cAunt Margie\u201d is not a blood relative, but just a woman who lives across the street from Keisha\u2019s grandmother. (The court, however, allowed Parnell to ride with the \u201caunt\u201d designation because of the precedent set in the 1983 case of Aunt Wilma v. the State of Georgia)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Caucasian's Guide To Spades Whether it is played in the back of a college cafeteria, at a bachelor party, or during a Black\u2026 Read more Read\n\nThe contest, scheduled to end when one of the contestants reached a total of 350, was abruptly interrupted during the first hand. Holding the last card, after winning six of the seven books bid by her team, Keisha played the monochrome card with the word \u201cJoker\u201d emblazoned across the top. Man Man, in response, played the colorful version of the joker card and proceeded to rake the book (Rake\u2019em v. Take\u2019em; 1971), setting Keisha and James.\n\nA dispute emerged when both parties claimed to have won the book. Keisha noted that no one had stated which joker was the big joker, so she assumed hers was the bigger, because it had the word \u201cguarantee\u201d on it, while Man Man countered that his joker was obviously larger in size, meaning it was, by definition, the \u201cbig joker.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA lower-court decision by Uncle Lester declined to solve the debate when he ruled: \u201cMy name is Bennett, and I ain\u2019t in it.\u201d The group then appealed to the district court. That court\u2019s hearings were interrupted when the \u201cCha Cha\u201d Slide interrupted the proceedings, bringing the issue before this court.\n\nMajority Opinion:\n\nIt is the opinion of this court, by a 5-4 decision, that the black-and-white Joker is the supreme card in the game of spades.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the court recognizes that this opinion can be overridden by house rules, as stated in the 1953 decision, This Is My Damn House v. That Don\u2019t Make You Right, Luther, this specific case applies only in the rare instances that the big joker is not determined before the commencement of spades-related activities.\n\nThe majority of the bench agrees with Keisha\u2019s oral argument that \u201cif the biggest joker was always the big joker, there would be no need to mention it.\u201d Furthermore, the court found that Keisha\u2019s spades-playing abilities are impeccable.\n\nIn reviewing the score from the game in question, it was determined that Keisha had not overbid, even turning a \u201cpossible\u201d into a book when she led with a queen of hearts, holding the ace even though she only had two cards in said suit. The fact that she cut the king demonstrates a level of ability rarely seen by the bench.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause of this demonstrated ability, the court finds it highly unlikely that Keisha would have held her joker to be played last if she thought it was the little joker.\n\nMargie, on the other hand, was found to be deficient as an opponent and card player. She underbid by two books on this hand, and a subsequent investigation found her to have reneged on three previous occasions. Also, several witnesses testified, under penalty of perjury and not being allowed any more of Uncle Junior\u2019s ribs, that Margie referred to the clubs suit as \u201cpuppy toes\u201d more than once, indicating that she was a novice spades player at best.\n\nBecause Man-Man licked the card and affixed it to his forehead, we were able to order a DNA analysis. We discovered that\u2014although it is likely that he assumed his was the big joker\u2014Man Man\u2019s consumption of three Bud Lights and no less than three red Solo cups of brown liquor may have played a part in his lack of clarity in the matter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTherefore, based on the available evidence and Keisha\u2019s argument of \u201cNigga, what do you think \u2018Guarantee\u2019 means?\u201d We declare that the black-and-white joker\u2014despite the size of the drawing\u2014is definitely the big joker.\n\nDissenting Opinion\n\nIn this matter, we determined that Man Man and Margie\u2019s joker is the big joker based on one essential fact:\n\nIt. Is. Bigger.\n\nIf the card manufacturers had not intended for the card in question not to be identified as more important, would they have spent more time coloring it in? Furthermore, ignoring the size of the illustration belies the fact that it is, according to the laws of science, a bigger joker.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe also reject the premise that Man Man\u2019s seeming intoxication means his judgment may have been affected. In the 1964 case Johnson v. Everybody Else, the lower court\u2019s decision was overturned when the Supreme Court found that alcohol played no part in his renege accusations. Research shows that 82 percent of all spades games are played with one or more players under the influence of alcohol.\n\nThe court recognizes that a better decision could have been reached by replaying the hand. However, we recognize the house rules that being set in the first hand eliminates the opponents from contention.\n\nIt is the opinion of this court that, for reasons of clarity and by every metric of common sense, the big joker should be the bigger joker. We do, however, acknowledge the precedent of house rules.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur Ruling\n\nBy a 5-4 margin, the court rules in favor of the plaintiff.\n\nHowever, we also rule that J-Mac\u2019s slur that referred to his opponents as \u201ccheating motherfuckers\u201d no longer applies, as this was a legitimate dispute. As such, he must compensate Man Man with the fifth of Crown Royal that spilled when J-Mac knocked over the spades table.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe suggest that the person taking score write \u201cbig\u201d on the agreed-upon joker, and clarify whether or not the deuce of diamonds is a spade or not. (This ruling does not apply when playing \u201cace down\u201d or with a \u201ckitty.\u201d)\n\nIn conclusion, the court also reprimands both the plaintiffs and the defendants in that disputes of this sort will never be addressed by this judicial body without the appropriate future consideration:\n\nYou must bring us a plate.", "keywords": ["spades", "card", "black", "supreme", "court", "big", "ruling", "played", "v", "keisha", "man", "decision", "joker"], "polarity": 0.1113577097505669, "subjectivity": 0.4160997732426305},

So ... not startling.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter studying a representative cross section of gun owners, researchers found that the people who have an emotional attachment to their guns were 78 percent white and 65 percent male. It must be noted that the sample size was small because\u2014despite widespread American gun ownership\u2014just 3 percent of the population owns half the guns in the country.\n\nRacial anxiety was a big reason for the uptick in gun ownership, according to Angela Stroud, a Northland College sociologist. Stroud went through concealed-weapon applications in Texas and interviewed applicants. She found that many of them wanted to protect their loved ones during the impending race war.\n\nApparently, Barack Obama came to the secret black meeting and told black people to attack the whites. (Wait ... you missed the meeting? It was great. Especially the catering. Best watermelon and Kool-Aid I ever tasted.) According to the report:\n\n... Stroud also discovered another motivation: racial anxiety. \u201cA lot of people talked about how important Obama was to get a concealed-carry license: \u2018He\u2019s for free health care, he\u2019s for welfare.\u2019 They were asking, \u2018Whatever happened to hard work?\u201d Obama\u2019s presidency, they feared, would empower minorities to threaten their property and families.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere are some of the more notable characteristics of the typical, emotionally attached gun owner:\n\nThey are less educated: According to Pew Research, about 26 percent of white college graduates own guns, compared with 40 percent of high school graduates and 42 percent of people with some college education. There is no significant difference in the rate of gun ownership across educational attainment among nonwhites.\n\n\n\nAccording to Pew Research, about 26 percent of white college graduates own guns, compared with 40 percent of high school graduates and 42 percent of people with some college education.

Pew Research shows that a larger percentage of blacks have been threatened with a firearm or know someone who has been shot, but white men are more likely to say they need a gun for protection. And while most blacks find gun violence to be a problem in their community, most Republicans say more guns would lead to less crime.\n\nSo there you have it. White men need guns to pretect them from the evil Negro monsters roaming the country. They are stockpiling arms like the zombie apocalypse, despite the fact that white men are three times more likely than blacks to kill themselves with a firearm ...\n\nEven though white men are more likely to be shot by another white person ...\n\nRegardless of the studies that show a gun in the home is also more likely to kill someone in the home than an intruder ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd even though most children who die from gun injuries are killed by a parent, sibling relative or friend ...\n\nIt\u2019s the scary black people they worry about.\n\nThat\u2019s just science.", "keywords": ["white", "theyre", "gun", "report", "college", "black", "owners", "guns", "study", "science", "ownership", "researchers", "men", "afraid", "stockpile"], "polarity": 0.11358363042186571, "subjectivity": 0.4163055163790458},

She\u2019s a little over 2 years old now, and it seems like every week she does or says something new that I had no idea she knew how to do or say. Yesterday morning, for instance, she noticed me laughing at a text I received, and then said, \u201cYou\u2019re silly, Daddy.\u201d She\u2019s undoubtedly heard the word \u201csilly\u201d before, but knowing it well enough to use it in the proper context is something I wasn\u2019t aware she could do.\n\nMy Facebook timeline today is filled with pictures and videos of school-age children across the country walking out of their schools, leading protests and giving speeches.

And the schools are not as safe as they should be because America considers its freedom-wrapped fears more important than the well-being of these young people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd because of this, American schoolchildren can now place themselves on the ever expanding list of people forced to live in and clean up the messes white American men continue to make.

The nationwide demonstration is being hailed as a groundbreaking act of civil disobedience that seeks to protect the lives of America\u2019s most vulnerable citizens. There is no way anyone could object to something so necessary and relevant.\n\nUnless, of course, black people do it.\n\nThe National School Walkout is a 17-minute planned act of defiance, protest and solidarity meant to spark action and commemorate the lives of 17 students gunned down at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet there be no misunderstanding: Nikolas Cruz is a mass murderer, and the massacre in Parkland was a tragedy. Hopefully this walkout will prompt our elected officials to take a long look at the nation\u2019s gun laws because those students deserve better. Their lives are valuable.\n\nBut not more valuable.\n\nThe game-changing, totally unique idea of the National School Walkout that is gathering attention all around the world is a tactic that has been tried before, to much derision. The people who sought to inspire meaningful change and spark conversation were called disruptive and communists and even castigated as terrorists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen white people started doing it.\n\nIn February 2016, students at Mount Hebron High School in Ellicott City, Md., left campus to highlight racism at their school, to responses like: \u201cStart a conversation? How\u2019s this for an opening line? Stop being professional victims and get your selves back into the school.\u201d\n\nIn Madison, Wis., cops arrested and maced students who walked out of school in protest of the 2015 police killing of Tony Robinson.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, there are some who will say that this has nothing to do with race. The shooting in Parkland is a national story, and that is why people are paying attention to those kids. It\u2019s not because they are white. The stories I just pointed out are lesser-known incidents, proving that people don\u2019t care about the color of the students advocating for change, or even the skin tone of the victims. This is about all lives!\n\nThey are correct.\n\nBut I might be wrong. This may simply be a case of imbalanced media focus. Who\u2019s to say that the Parkland students are receiving more media attention for the walkout because the victims and the activists are mostly white?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is no one in America who doesn\u2019t know about the tragic deaths of those high school students. It is a big, talked-about national news incident. Maybe they are garnering attention and inspiring legislative change simply because they are young and conscious.\n\nOf course, that wouldn\u2019t explain why\u2014unlike with the recently passed gun legislation in Florida\u2014no one bothered to examine the \u201cStand your ground\u201d law after high schoolers all over Florida walked out in protest of Trayvon Martin\u2019s death, which was arguably more widely known. What about the students who walked out in protest of the Mike Brown nonverdict in St. Louis County? That was definitely a bigger story than Parkland.\n\nPerhaps I\u2019m ranting about nothing. You know me, always bringing up race. Or maybe I am cherry-picking isolated incidents. Maybe black kids protesting by walking out of schools was never really a thing and I\u2019m making up stories like these:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can be sure that some anally injured, weak-skinned troll will seek to dismiss this article by posing the ancient Caucasian riddle: \u201cBut what about black-on-black violence? (Which, according to my research, is different from \u201cbutt-hurt.\u201d Anal injuries are real.)\n\nBut anyone in a black community knows that stop-the-violence rallies greatly outnumber Black Lives Matter protests. However, the media refuses to cover those marches with the same rabid fervor. Why the hell would white people even hear about the Chicago elementary school kids who marched against gun violence in their communities in 2017? Or the black and Hispanic high school students in Los Angeles who walked out to protest gang and gun violence? Do they even know about the kids in Sandy Spring, Ga., who held a sit-in at school to protest gun violence? How about the kids at Chicago\u2019s Polaris Academy who organized a \u201cplay outside\u201d day in protest of gang and gun violence almost a year ago?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 17 lives ended in the halls of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High shouldn\u2019t matter any more than the countless ones snuffed out by the drug war, police brutality and\u2014yes, I\u2019ll say it this time\u2014black-on-black crime. You don\u2019t think black kids want to feel safe, too? Contrary to the belief of police officers and \u201cAll Lives Matter\u201d activists, black bodies are not bulletproof.\n\nThis criticism in no way disparages the actions of students across the country protesting gun laws. Ultimately, everyone hopes that the National Student Walkout inspires necessary change. Yet this is simply the latest example of the national double standard placed on the shoulders of black people.\n\nAfter all, black resistance is like rap music; Bo Derek braids cornrows; moving to a Brooklyn, N.Y., neighborhood; and relocating to this great, big land called America: No one ever gives a fuck about it ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUntil white people start doing it.", "keywords": ["gun", "students", "high", "forget", "walk", "save", "national", "black", "lets", "lives", "protest", "kids", "school", "happens", "walkout"], "polarity": 0.0754330065359477, "subjectivity": 0.4435912698412699},

Prescott decision, The Root has decided to print the full decision as well as the minority opinion.\n\nStatement of Facts:\n\nOn July 4, 2016, at a family barbecue, Keisha Prescott was engaged in a spades match with her cousin James \u201cJ-Mac\u201d McDaniel. They were battling Keisha\u2019s aunt Margaret Parnell and her uncle Manuel Prescott (heretofore referred to by his more accepted moniker, \u201cMan Man.\u201d) Records show that \u201cAunt Margie\u201d is not a blood relative, but just a woman who lives across the street from Keisha\u2019s grandmother. (The court, however, allowed Parnell to ride with the \u201caunt\u201d designation because of the precedent set in the 1983 case of Aunt Wilma v. the State of Georgia)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Caucasian's Guide To Spades Whether it is played in the back of a college cafeteria, at a bachelor party, or during a Black\u2026 Read more Read\n\nThe contest, scheduled to end when one of the contestants reached a total of 350, was abruptly interrupted during the first hand. Holding the last card, after winning six of the seven books bid by her team, Keisha played the monochrome card with the word \u201cJoker\u201d emblazoned across the top. Man Man, in response, played the colorful version of the joker card and proceeded to rake the book (Rake\u2019em v. Take\u2019em; 1971), setting Keisha and James.\n\nA dispute emerged when both parties claimed to have won the book. Keisha noted that no one had stated which joker was the big joker, so she assumed hers was the bigger, because it had the word \u201cguarantee\u201d on it, while Man Man countered that his joker was obviously larger in size, meaning it was, by definition, the \u201cbig joker.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA lower-court decision by Uncle Lester declined to solve the debate when he ruled: \u201cMy name is Bennett, and I ain\u2019t in it.\u201d The group then appealed to the district court. That court\u2019s hearings were interrupted when the \u201cCha Cha\u201d Slide interrupted the proceedings, bringing the issue before this court.\n\nMajority Opinion:\n\nIt is the opinion of this court, by a 5-4 decision, that the black-and-white Joker is the supreme card in the game of spades.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the court recognizes that this opinion can be overridden by house rules, as stated in the 1953 decision, This Is My Damn House v. That Don\u2019t Make You Right, Luther, this specific case applies only in the rare instances that the big joker is not determined before the commencement of spades-related activities.\n\nThe majority of the bench agrees with Keisha\u2019s oral argument that \u201cif the biggest joker was always the big joker, there would be no need to mention it.\u201d Furthermore, the court found that Keisha\u2019s spades-playing abilities are impeccable.\n\nIn reviewing the score from the game in question, it was determined that Keisha had not overbid, even turning a \u201cpossible\u201d into a book when she led with a queen of hearts, holding the ace even though she only had two cards in said suit. The fact that she cut the king demonstrates a level of ability rarely seen by the bench.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause of this demonstrated ability, the court finds it highly unlikely that Keisha would have held her joker to be played last if she thought it was the little joker.\n\nMargie, on the other hand, was found to be deficient as an opponent and card player. She underbid by two books on this hand, and a subsequent investigation found her to have reneged on three previous occasions. Also, several witnesses testified, under penalty of perjury and not being allowed any more of Uncle Junior\u2019s ribs, that Margie referred to the clubs suit as \u201cpuppy toes\u201d more than once, indicating that she was a novice spades player at best.\n\nBecause Man-Man licked the card and affixed it to his forehead, we were able to order a DNA analysis. We discovered that\u2014although it is likely that he assumed his was the big joker\u2014Man Man\u2019s consumption of three Bud Lights and no less than three red Solo cups of brown liquor may have played a part in his lack of clarity in the matter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTherefore, based on the available evidence and Keisha\u2019s argument of \u201cNigga, what do you think \u2018Guarantee\u2019 means?\u201d We declare that the black-and-white joker\u2014despite the size of the drawing\u2014is definitely the big joker.\n\nDissenting Opinion\n\nIn this matter, we determined that Man Man and Margie\u2019s joker is the big joker based on one essential fact:\n\nIt. Is. Bigger.\n\nIf the card manufacturers had not intended for the card in question not to be identified as more important, would they have spent more time coloring it in? Furthermore, ignoring the size of the illustration belies the fact that it is, according to the laws of science, a bigger joker.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe also reject the premise that Man Man\u2019s seeming intoxication means his judgment may have been affected. In the 1964 case Johnson v. Everybody Else, the lower court\u2019s decision was overturned when the Supreme Court found that alcohol played no part in his renege accusations. Research shows that 82 percent of all spades games are played with one or more players under the influence of alcohol.\n\nThe court recognizes that a better decision could have been reached by replaying the hand. However, we recognize the house rules that being set in the first hand eliminates the opponents from contention.\n\nIt is the opinion of this court that, for reasons of clarity and by every metric of common sense, the big joker should be the bigger joker. We do, however, acknowledge the precedent of house rules.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur Ruling\n\nBy a 5-4 margin, the court rules in favor of the plaintiff.\n\nHowever, we also rule that J-Mac\u2019s slur that referred to his opponents as \u201ccheating motherfuckers\u201d no longer applies, as this was a legitimate dispute.

Yesterday morning, for instance, she noticed me laughing at a text I received, and then said, \u201cYou\u2019re silly, Daddy.\u201d She\u2019s undoubtedly heard the word \u201csilly\u201d before, but knowing it well enough to use it in the proper context is something I wasn\u2019t aware she could do.\n\nMy Facebook timeline today is filled with pictures and videos of school-age children across the country walking out of their schools, leading protests and giving speeches. Some of these images were posted by the proud parents of children participating in #NationalWalkoutDay. And some of these parents expressed joyous surprise at how brave and passionate and articulate their children were.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s not that the parents had low expectations for them. They just have never had the opportunity to see their children like this. And while these are not my children, I felt (and still feel) that same parental pride when watching and reading about these amazing young people. I can see my daughter in these kids, and I\u2019m as proud of and protective of them as I would be with her.\n\nToday is also a goddamn fucking disgrace.\n\nPerhaps, in time, #NationalWalkoutDay will be remembered as a prominent act in a series of acts that forced America to reconsider and change its relationship with guns. But right now, today, all I can think about is how these kids should have been in school. And how the schools they\u2019re in should be safe. But they were not in school because the schools aren\u2019t as safe as they should be. And the schools are not as safe as they should be because America considers its freedom-wrapped fears more important than the well-being of these young people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd because of this, American schoolchildren can now place themselves on the ever expanding list of people forced to live in and clean up the messes white American men continue to make. A list that, of course, includes black people, all women, Mexicans and too many other groups to name.\n\nAs a dad, I can\u2019t wait for my daughter to continue to surprise me.

The incident occurred during a course about gun safety.\n\nAccording to KSBW-TV, Dennis Alexander was leading the Administration of Justice class at Seaside High School when his firearm went off at about 1:20 p.m. Alexander was pointing the weapon to the ceiling when it went off, causing pieces of the ceiling to fall to the floor.\n\nThe Seaside Police Department confirmed that while no one suffered \u201cserious injuries,\u201d one 17-year-old boy suffered \u201cmoderate\u201d injuries after fragments from the bullet ricocheted off the ceiling and hit his neck.\n\nAlexander had, in fact, told the class that he wanted to make sure the gun wasn\u2019t loaded when it went off, Fermin Gonzales, the father of the injured teen, told the news station.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the craziest thing. It could have been very bad,\u201d Gonzales said.\n\nWhat was really crazy was that after the gun went off, Alexander apparently apologized and went on doing what he was doing. No one at the school, according to Gonzales, checked to make sure that everyone was OK. So you can imagine how shocked the Gonzales family was when the teen returned home with blood on his shirt and bullet fragments in his neck. His parents had to rush him to the hospital to be examined.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s shaken up, but he\u2019s going to be OK,\u201d Gonzales told KSBW. \u201cI\u2019m just pretty upset that no one told us anything and we had to call the police ourselves to report it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlexander was placed on administrative leave from his teaching position at the high school as well as with the Sand City, Calif., Police Department.\n\n\u201cI have concerns about why he was displaying a loaded firearm in a classroom. We will be looking into that,\u201d Sand City Police Chief Brian Ferrante told KSBW.\n\nNot to mention that in California, teachers are not allowed to have firearms in classrooms, even if they do have a concealed carry permit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis all went on the day before the National Student Walkout, with students marching for their very lives, demanding new gun laws ... and while lawmakers are debating arming teachers and having more \u201ctrained\u201d individuals\u2014like Alexander, I bet\u2014to keep students ... safe?\n\n\n\nRight.\n\nOh, I should also mention that a similar incident occurred the same exact day on the East Coast at a Virginia school.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn this scenario, another \u201ctrained professional,\u201d a school resource officer, somehow accidentally fired his gun inside a middle school in Alexandria. The shot was fired as the officer, a five-year veteran of the Alexandria Police Department, was sitting down in his office, according to NBC Washington.\n\n\u201cI just think it was an accident that happened, and we\u2019re going to investigate it and find out, and we\u2019re going to move forward,\u201d Capt.

Prescott decision, The Root has decided to print the full decision as well as the minority opinion.\n\nStatement of Facts:\n\nOn July 4, 2016, at a family barbecue, Keisha Prescott was engaged in a spades match with her cousin James \u201cJ-Mac\u201d McDaniel. They were battling Keisha\u2019s aunt Margaret Parnell and her uncle Manuel Prescott (heretofore referred to by his more accepted moniker, \u201cMan Man.\u201d) Records show that \u201cAunt Margie\u201d is not a blood relative, but just a woman who lives across the street from Keisha\u2019s grandmother. (The court, however, allowed Parnell to ride with the \u201caunt\u201d designation because of the precedent set in the 1983 case of Aunt Wilma v. the State of Georgia)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Caucasian's Guide To Spades Whether it is played in the back of a college cafeteria, at a bachelor party, or during a Black\u2026 Read more Read\n\nThe contest, scheduled to end when one of the contestants reached a total of 350, was abruptly interrupted during the first hand. Holding the last card, after winning six of the seven books bid by her team, Keisha played the monochrome card with the word \u201cJoker\u201d emblazoned across the top. Man Man, in response, played the colorful version of the joker card and proceeded to rake the book (Rake\u2019em v. Take\u2019em; 1971), setting Keisha and James.\n\nA dispute emerged when both parties claimed to have won the book. Keisha noted that no one had stated which joker was the big joker, so she assumed hers was the bigger, because it had the word \u201cguarantee\u201d on it, while Man Man countered that his joker was obviously larger in size, meaning it was, by definition, the \u201cbig joker.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA lower-court decision by Uncle Lester declined to solve the debate when he ruled: \u201cMy name is Bennett, and I ain\u2019t in it.\u201d The group then appealed to the district court. That court\u2019s hearings were interrupted when the \u201cCha Cha\u201d Slide interrupted the proceedings, bringing the issue before this court.\n\nMajority Opinion:\n\nIt is the opinion of this court, by a 5-4 decision, that the black-and-white Joker is the supreme card in the game of spades.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the court recognizes that this opinion can be overridden by house rules, as stated in the 1953 decision, This Is My Damn House v. That Don\u2019t Make You Right, Luther, this specific case applies only in the rare instances that the big joker is not determined before the commencement of spades-related activities.\n\nThe majority of the bench agrees with Keisha\u2019s oral argument that \u201cif the biggest joker was always the big joker, there would be no need to mention it.\u201d Furthermore, the court found that Keisha\u2019s spades-playing abilities are impeccable.\n\nIn reviewing the score from the game in question, it was determined that Keisha had not overbid, even turning a \u201cpossible\u201d into a book when she led with a queen of hearts, holding the ace even though she only had two cards in said suit. The fact that she cut the king demonstrates a level of ability rarely seen by the bench.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause of this demonstrated ability, the court finds it highly unlikely that Keisha would have held her joker to be played last if she thought it was the little joker.\n\nMargie, on the other hand, was found to be deficient as an opponent and card player. She underbid by two books on this hand, and a subsequent investigation found her to have reneged on three previous occasions. Also, several witnesses testified, under penalty of perjury and not being allowed any more of Uncle Junior\u2019s ribs, that Margie referred to the clubs suit as \u201cpuppy toes\u201d more than once, indicating that she was a novice spades player at best.\n\nBecause Man-Man licked the card and affixed it to his forehead, we were able to order a DNA analysis. We discovered that\u2014although it is likely that he assumed his was the big joker\u2014Man Man\u2019s consumption of three Bud Lights and no less than three red Solo cups of brown liquor may have played a part in his lack of clarity in the matter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTherefore, based on the available evidence and Keisha\u2019s argument of \u201cNigga, what do you think \u2018Guarantee\u2019 means?\u201d We declare that the black-and-white joker\u2014despite the size of the drawing\u2014is definitely the big joker.\n\nDissenting Opinion\n\nIn this matter, we determined that Man Man and Margie\u2019s joker is the big joker based on one essential fact:\n\nIt. Is. Bigger.\n\nIf the card manufacturers had not intended for the card in question not to be identified as more important, would they have spent more time coloring it in? Furthermore, ignoring the size of the illustration belies the fact that it is, according to the laws of science, a bigger joker.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe also reject the premise that Man Man\u2019s seeming intoxication means his judgment may have been affected. In the 1964 case Johnson v. Everybody Else, the lower court\u2019s decision was overturned when the Supreme Court found that alcohol played no part in his renege accusations. Research shows that 82 percent of all spades games are played with one or more players under the influence of alcohol.\n\nThe court recognizes that a better decision could have been reached by replaying the hand. However, we recognize the house rules that being set in the first hand eliminates the opponents from contention.\n\nIt is the opinion of this court that, for reasons of clarity and by every metric of common sense, the big joker should be the bigger joker. We do, however, acknowledge the precedent of house rules.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur Ruling\n\nBy a 5-4 margin, the court rules in favor of the plaintiff.\n\nHowever, we also rule that J-Mac\u2019s slur that referred to his opponents as \u201ccheating motherfuckers\u201d no longer applies, as this was a legitimate dispute. As such, he must compensate Man Man with the fifth of Crown Royal that spilled when J-Mac knocked over the spades table.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe suggest that the person taking score write \u201cbig\u201d on the agreed-upon joker, and clarify whether or not the deuce of diamonds is a spade or not. (This ruling does not apply when playing \u201cace down\u201d or with a \u201ckitty.\u201d)\n\nIn conclusion, the court also reprimands both the plaintiffs and the defendants in that disputes of this sort will never be addressed by this judicial body without the appropriate future consideration:\n\nYou must bring us a plate.", "keywords": ["spades", "card", "black", "supreme", "court", "big", "ruling", "played", "v", "keisha", "man", "decision", "joker"], "polarity": 0.1113577097505669, "subjectivity": 0.4160997732426305},

The nationwide demonstration is being hailed as a groundbreaking act of civil disobedience that seeks to protect the lives of America\u2019s most vulnerable citizens. There is no way anyone could object to something so necessary and relevant.\n\nUnless, of course, black people do it.\n\nThe National School Walkout is a 17-minute planned act of defiance, protest and solidarity meant to spark action and commemorate the lives of 17 students gunned down at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet there be no misunderstanding: Nikolas Cruz is a mass murderer, and the massacre in Parkland was a tragedy. Hopefully this walkout will prompt our elected officials to take a long look at the nation\u2019s gun laws because those students deserve better. Their lives are valuable.\n\nBut not more valuable.\n\nThe game-changing, totally unique idea of the National School Walkout that is gathering attention all around the world is a tactic that has been tried before, to much derision. The people who sought to inspire meaningful change and spark conversation were called disruptive and communists and even castigated as terrorists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen white people started doing it.\n\nIn February 2016, students at Mount Hebron High School in Ellicott City, Md., left campus to highlight racism at their school, to responses like: \u201cStart a conversation? How\u2019s this for an opening line? Stop being professional victims and get your selves back into the school.\u201d\n\nIn Madison, Wis., cops arrested and maced students who walked out of school in protest of the 2015 police killing of Tony Robinson.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, there are some who will say that this has nothing to do with race. The shooting in Parkland is a national story, and that is why people are paying attention to those kids. It\u2019s not because they are white. The stories I just pointed out are lesser-known incidents, proving that people don\u2019t care about the color of the students advocating for change, or even the skin tone of the victims. This is about all lives!\n\nThey are correct.\n\nBut I might be wrong. This may simply be a case of imbalanced media focus. Who\u2019s to say that the Parkland students are receiving more media attention for the walkout because the victims and the activists are mostly white?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is no one in America who doesn\u2019t know about the tragic deaths of those high school students. It is a big, talked-about national news incident. Maybe they are garnering attention and inspiring legislative change simply because they are young and conscious.\n\nOf course, that wouldn\u2019t explain why\u2014unlike with the recently passed gun legislation in Florida\u2014no one bothered to examine the \u201cStand your ground\u201d law after high schoolers all over Florida walked out in protest of Trayvon Martin\u2019s death, which was arguably more widely known. What about the students who walked out in protest of the Mike Brown nonverdict in St. Louis County? That was definitely a bigger story than Parkland.\n\nPerhaps I\u2019m ranting about nothing. You know me, always bringing up race. Or maybe I am cherry-picking isolated incidents. Maybe black kids protesting by walking out of schools was never really a thing and I\u2019m making up stories like these:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can be sure that some anally injured, weak-skinned troll will seek to dismiss this article by posing the ancient Caucasian riddle: \u201cBut what about black-on-black violence? (Which, according to my research, is different from \u201cbutt-hurt.\u201d Anal injuries are real.)\n\nBut anyone in a black community knows that stop-the-violence rallies greatly outnumber Black Lives Matter protests. However, the media refuses to cover those marches with the same rabid fervor. Why the hell would white people even hear about the Chicago elementary school kids who marched against gun violence in their communities in 2017? Or the black and Hispanic high school students in Los Angeles who walked out to protest gang and gun violence? Do they even know about the kids in Sandy Spring, Ga., who held a sit-in at school to protest gun violence? How about the kids at Chicago\u2019s Polaris Academy who organized a \u201cplay outside\u201d day in protest of gang and gun violence almost a year ago?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 17 lives ended in the halls of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High shouldn\u2019t matter any more than the countless ones snuffed out by the drug war, police brutality and\u2014yes, I\u2019ll say it this time\u2014black-on-black crime. You don\u2019t think black kids want to feel safe, too? Contrary to the belief of police officers and \u201cAll Lives Matter\u201d activists, black bodies are not bulletproof.\n\nThis criticism in no way disparages the actions of students across the country protesting gun laws. Ultimately, everyone hopes that the National Student Walkout inspires necessary change. Yet this is simply the latest example of the national double standard placed on the shoulders of black people.\n\nAfter all, black resistance is like rap music; Bo Derek braids cornrows; moving to a Brooklyn, N.Y., neighborhood; and relocating to this great, big land called America: No one ever gives a fuck about it ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUntil white people start doing it.", "keywords": ["gun", "students", "high", "forget", "walk", "save", "national", "black", "lets", "lives", "protest", "kids", "school", "happens", "walkout"], "polarity": 0.0754330065359477, "subjectivity": 0.4435912698412699},

The incident occurred during a course about gun safety.\n\nAccording to KSBW-TV, Dennis Alexander was leading the Administration of Justice class at Seaside High School when his firearm went off at about 1:20 p.m. Alexander was pointing the weapon to the ceiling when it went off, causing pieces of the ceiling to fall to the floor.\n\nThe Seaside Police Department confirmed that while no one suffered \u201cserious injuries,\u201d one 17-year-old boy suffered \u201cmoderate\u201d injuries after fragments from the bullet ricocheted off the ceiling and hit his neck.\n\nAlexander had, in fact, told the class that he wanted to make sure the gun wasn\u2019t loaded when it went off, Fermin Gonzales, the father of the injured teen, told the news station.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the craziest thing. It could have been very bad,\u201d Gonzales said.\n\nWhat was really crazy was that after the gun went off, Alexander apparently apologized and went on doing what he was doing. No one at the school, according to Gonzales, checked to make sure that everyone was OK. So you can imagine how shocked the Gonzales family was when the teen returned home with blood on his shirt and bullet fragments in his neck. His parents had to rush him to the hospital to be examined.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s shaken up, but he\u2019s going to be OK,\u201d Gonzales told KSBW. \u201cI\u2019m just pretty upset that no one told us anything and we had to call the police ourselves to report it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlexander was placed on administrative leave from his teaching position at the high school as well as with the Sand City, Calif., Police Department.\n\n\u201cI have concerns about why he was displaying a loaded firearm in a classroom.

There are black people across this country who have blood relatives they don\u2019t know about, including sisters, brothers and sometimes parents. Ranking higher than any DNA-based relationship, though, is the earned honorific of \u201cplay cousin.\u201d A play cousin is a de facto sibling. It is more family member than actual family.\n\nWhen I was growing up, my mother\u2019s best friend had four children. She was as much my aunt as any of my mother\u2019s sisters. Her husband was one of the scant few in-house fathers in my neighborhood, and he was a hulking figure of a man who still calls me \u201cprofessor.\u201d Like my family, they had three girls, and only one of their children was a boy. His name was Heyward Jackson Jr., but in most black neighborhoods, birth names are as malleable as DNA and often give way to nicknames.\n\nWe call him \u201cJunie Poonie.\u201d\n\nAccording to KVVU-TV, on Feb. 21, Heyward Jackon Jr. was attending a church service at his Las Vegas church when he noticed 23-year-old Calin Howard Hodges asleep on a pew. Junie asked Hodges if he needed some help because he looked disheveled. Hodges declined Heyward\u2019s help and told Junie that he was \u201cplanning something big.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJunie began talking to Hodges (and I know Junie; he can charm a space alien from Nebula 5 who only speaks Quooloc into an engaging conversation by making a person think he genuinely cares about their home galaxy and is interested in what they have to say). Hodges began telling Heyward that he was planning to become \u201cthe greatest mass shooter in history,\u201d referenced Stephen Paddock, and, according to the police report, added that he \u201ccompletely identifies with every mass shooter\u201d and \u201csalutes every person who has the balls to do it.\u201d\n\nAnd what did Junie do? He kept talking to the dude and surreptitiously began recording the conversation on his cellphone. About 40 members of the church were shuffled outside and the police were called while Junie kept the man engaged.\n\nWhen the cops arrived, Junie shared his recordings with the officers and they arrested Hodges. \u201cPolice charged Hodges with making threats or conveying false information concerning acts of terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, lethal agents or toxins prohibited,\u201d KVVU-TV reports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolice will not say if Hodges was armed. According to the Las Vegas Review-Journal, he was an adult film actor who had been fired as a Lyft driver.\n\n\n\nNevada has some of the weakest gun laws in the country. Newsweek describes them this way:\n\nNevada law does not require firearms owners to have licenses or register their weapons, nor does it limit the number of firearms an individual posses. Automatic assault weapons and machine guns are also legal in the state as long as they are registered and possessed in adherence to federal law, according to the National Rifle Association.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf this incident seems like someone just rambling to a stranger, when police searched Hodges\u2019 car, they found a diary saying, \u201cStephen Paddock stole my idea on 1 October.\u201d \u201c1 October\u201d is a reference to the day Stephen Paddock killed 58 people at a country music concert in Las Vegas.\n\nCalin Hodges\u2019 planned mass execution was also reminiscent of Dylann Roof, who shot up Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C.\u2014the state where Junie and I grew up\u2014killing nine parishioners during a Wednesday-night Bible study.\n\nHeyward thwarted Hodges\u2019 copycat crime on Feb. 21\u2014at Mountain Top Faith Ministries\u2019 Wednesday-night Bible study.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJunie and I grew up like brothers along with another one of our friends, James Bond (no, that\u2019s not a nickname; James\u2019 nickname is 007, or \u201cDouble-O\u201d), who lived on the same street. The three of us were the rare few guys in our entire neighborhood to escape our surroundings and go to college. I somehow managed to get an academic scholarship. Double-O went into the Army and then to college. Junie attended college on a football scholarship and later moved to Las Vegas to play semipro football.\n\n\n\nThey were the cool guys. I was the nerd. They were both charismatic and athletic. I was the nerd. Our families attended the same church. We teased each other\u2019s sisters. We ate at each other\u2019s table. Junie was younger than us, but he was never afraid of shit, maybe because he was crazy. Or maybe because he\u2019s been built like a brick shithouse since he was about 8.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur only disagreement in life was when Junie informed me and Double-O that he was pledging Kappa. I\u2019m still disappointed in him for that. But he\u2019s still my play cousin. Plus, I\u2019ve never seen Junie shimmy.\n\nWhen I spoke to Junie, he told me he was definitely \u201cshook,\u201d but told me he couldn\u2019t reveal the details publicly because prosecutors had issued a gag order on the case. He also said that he thinks people need to hear the audio recordings so the public can know the kinds of people who have access to guns.\n\nWe rarely talk much these days, and to be honest, it\u2019s my fault. Whenever we have a conversation, it\u2019s because he occasionally reaches out to me to talk about something random. He now lives in Vegas and I live in Alabama, so we don\u2019t even get to see each other\u2019s families.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the last few years, we have seen each other a couple of times. His nephew was in a car accident a few miles from my home last year, and I made sure Junie\u2019s sister, mother and father were well-fed when they were in town. He called me when he was getting married, and we got the chance to hang out last summer. We were both in town on business, so we didn\u2019t spend a long time together.\n\nThe FBI reports that of the 104 active-shooter events between 2000 and 2012, 17 were stopped by potential victims. In 14 of those situations, the shooting was stopped by someone who was unarmed and managed to talk to the person or subdue the shooter with no weapon.\n\nOnly three active shooters were stopped by a good guy with a gun.\n\nI know Heyward Jackson Jr. and cannot imagine him being erased from the earth by a psychopath. Even worse, I can\u2019t fathom that someone would become a celebrity by killing my play cousin and lifelong friend. He is a father. He is a husband.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJunie Poonie is a good guy.\n\nHe did not have a gun.", "keywords": ["myth", "hodges", "shooter", "disproved", "mass", "guys", "good", "vegas", "las", "church", "guns", "know", "cousin", "stopped", "shooting", "play", "junie"], "polarity": 0.0872320768662232, "subjectivity": 0.46316298877274487},

Prescott decision, The Root has decided to print the full decision as well as the minority opinion.\n\nStatement of Facts:\n\nOn July 4, 2016, at a family barbecue, Keisha Prescott was engaged in a spades match with her cousin James \u201cJ-Mac\u201d McDaniel. They were battling Keisha\u2019s aunt Margaret Parnell and her uncle Manuel Prescott (heretofore referred to by his more accepted moniker, \u201cMan Man.\u201d) Records show that \u201cAunt Margie\u201d is not a blood relative, but just a woman who lives across the street from Keisha\u2019s grandmother. (The court, however, allowed Parnell to ride with the \u201caunt\u201d designation because of the precedent set in the 1983 case of Aunt Wilma v. the State of Georgia)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Caucasian's Guide To Spades Whether it is played in the back of a college cafeteria, at a bachelor party, or during a Black\u2026 Read more Read\n\nThe contest, scheduled to end when one of the contestants reached a total of 350, was abruptly interrupted during the first hand. Holding the last card, after winning six of the seven books bid by her team, Keisha played the monochrome card with the word \u201cJoker\u201d emblazoned across the top. Man Man, in response, played the colorful version of the joker card and proceeded to rake the book (Rake\u2019em v. Take\u2019em; 1971), setting Keisha and James.\n\nA dispute emerged when both parties claimed to have won the book. Keisha noted that no one had stated which joker was the big joker, so she assumed hers was the bigger, because it had the word \u201cguarantee\u201d on it, while Man Man countered that his joker was obviously larger in size, meaning it was, by definition, the \u201cbig joker.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA lower-court decision by Uncle Lester declined to solve the debate when he ruled: \u201cMy name is Bennett, and I ain\u2019t in it.\u201d The group then appealed to the district court. That court\u2019s hearings were interrupted when the \u201cCha Cha\u201d Slide interrupted the proceedings, bringing the issue before this court.\n\nMajority Opinion:\n\nIt is the opinion of this court, by a 5-4 decision, that the black-and-white Joker is the supreme card in the game of spades.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the court recognizes that this opinion can be overridden by house rules, as stated in the 1953 decision, This Is My Damn House v. That Don\u2019t Make You Right, Luther, this specific case applies only in the rare instances that the big joker is not determined before the commencement of spades-related activities.\n\nThe majority of the bench agrees with Keisha\u2019s oral argument that \u201cif the biggest joker was always the big joker, there would be no need to mention it.\u201d Furthermore, the court found that Keisha\u2019s spades-playing abilities are impeccable.\n\nIn reviewing the score from the game in question, it was determined that Keisha had not overbid, even turning a \u201cpossible\u201d into a book when she led with a queen of hearts, holding the ace even though she only had two cards in said suit. The fact that she cut the king demonstrates a level of ability rarely seen by the bench.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause of this demonstrated ability, the court finds it highly unlikely that Keisha would have held her joker to be played last if she thought it was the little joker.\n\nMargie, on the other hand, was found to be deficient as an opponent and card player. She underbid by two books on this hand, and a subsequent investigation found her to have reneged on three previous occasions. Also, several witnesses testified, under penalty of perjury and not being allowed any more of Uncle Junior\u2019s ribs, that Margie referred to the clubs suit as \u201cpuppy toes\u201d more than once, indicating that she was a novice spades player at best.\n\nBecause Man-Man licked the card and affixed it to his forehead, we were able to order a DNA analysis. We discovered that\u2014although it is likely that he assumed his was the big joker\u2014Man Man\u2019s consumption of three Bud Lights and no less than three red Solo cups of brown liquor may have played a part in his lack of clarity in the matter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTherefore, based on the available evidence and Keisha\u2019s argument of \u201cNigga, what do you think \u2018Guarantee\u2019 means?\u201d We declare that the black-and-white joker\u2014despite the size of the drawing\u2014is definitely the big joker.\n\nDissenting Opinion\n\nIn this matter, we determined that Man Man and Margie\u2019s joker is the big joker based on one essential fact:\n\nIt. Is. Bigger.\n\nIf the card manufacturers had not intended for the card in question not to be identified as more important, would they have spent more time coloring it in? Furthermore, ignoring the size of the illustration belies the fact that it is, according to the laws of science, a bigger joker.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe also reject the premise that Man Man\u2019s seeming intoxication means his judgment may have been affected. In the 1964 case Johnson v. Everybody Else, the lower court\u2019s decision was overturned when the Supreme Court found that alcohol played no part in his renege accusations. Research shows that 82 percent of all spades games are played with one or more players under the influence of alcohol.\n\nThe court recognizes that a better decision could have been reached by replaying the hand. However, we recognize the house rules that being set in the first hand eliminates the opponents from contention.\n\nIt is the opinion of this court that, for reasons of clarity and by every metric of common sense, the big joker should be the bigger joker. We do, however, acknowledge the precedent of house rules.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur Ruling\n\nBy a 5-4 margin, the court rules in favor of the plaintiff.\n\nHowever, we also rule that J-Mac\u2019s slur that referred to his opponents as \u201ccheating motherfuckers\u201d no longer applies, as this was a legitimate dispute. As such, he must compensate Man Man with the fifth of Crown Royal that spilled when J-Mac knocked over the spades table.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe suggest that the person taking score write \u201cbig\u201d on the agreed-upon joker, and clarify whether or not the deuce of diamonds is a spade or not. (This ruling does not apply when playing \u201cace down\u201d or with a \u201ckitty.\u201d)\n\nIn conclusion, the court also reprimands both the plaintiffs and the defendants in that disputes of this sort will never be addressed by this judicial body without the appropriate future consideration:\n\nYou must bring us a plate.", "keywords": ["spades", "card", "black", "supreme", "court", "big", "ruling", "played", "v", "keisha", "man", "decision", "joker"], "polarity": 0.1113577097505669, "subjectivity": 0.4160997732426305},

However, in recent days, students Josh Gallagher and Connor Dietrich are refuting that narrative, both expressing disgust toward Gard on Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Twitter, Gallagher wrote that Gard \u201ccalled himself a hero, and ... the media portrayed him as a hero when in reality he is the opposite.\u201d\n\nGallagher said that he was in Gard\u2019s class when the fire alarm went off and students started filing out.

It is more family member than actual family.\n\nWhen I was growing up, my mother\u2019s best friend had four children. She was as much my aunt as any of my mother\u2019s sisters. Her husband was one of the scant few in-house fathers in my neighborhood, and he was a hulking figure of a man who still calls me \u201cprofessor.\u201d Like my family, they had three girls, and only one of their children was a boy. His name was Heyward Jackson Jr., but in most black neighborhoods, birth names are as malleable as DNA and often give way to nicknames.\n\nWe call him \u201cJunie Poonie.\u201d\n\nAccording to KVVU-TV, on Feb. 21, Heyward Jackon Jr. was attending a church service at his Las Vegas church when he noticed 23-year-old Calin Howard Hodges asleep on a pew. Junie asked Hodges if he needed some help because he looked disheveled. Hodges declined Heyward\u2019s help and told Junie that he was \u201cplanning something big.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJunie began talking to Hodges (and I know Junie; he can charm a space alien from Nebula 5 who only speaks Quooloc into an engaging conversation by making a person think he genuinely cares about their home galaxy and is interested in what they have to say). Hodges began telling Heyward that he was planning to become \u201cthe greatest mass shooter in history,\u201d referenced Stephen Paddock, and, according to the police report, added that he \u201ccompletely identifies with every mass shooter\u201d and \u201csalutes every person who has the balls to do it.\u201d\n\nAnd what did Junie do? He kept talking to the dude and surreptitiously began recording the conversation on his cellphone. About 40 members of the church were shuffled outside and the police were called while Junie kept the man engaged.\n\nWhen the cops arrived, Junie shared his recordings with the officers and they arrested Hodges. \u201cPolice charged Hodges with making threats or conveying false information concerning acts of terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, lethal agents or toxins prohibited,\u201d KVVU-TV reports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolice will not say if Hodges was armed. According to the Las Vegas Review-Journal, he was an adult film actor who had been fired as a Lyft driver.\n\n\n\nNevada has some of the weakest gun laws in the country. Newsweek describes them this way:\n\nNevada law does not require firearms owners to have licenses or register their weapons, nor does it limit the number of firearms an individual posses. Automatic assault weapons and machine guns are also legal in the state as long as they are registered and possessed in adherence to federal law, according to the National Rifle Association.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf this incident seems like someone just rambling to a stranger, when police searched Hodges\u2019 car, they found a diary saying, \u201cStephen Paddock stole my idea on 1 October.\u201d \u201c1 October\u201d is a reference to the day Stephen Paddock killed 58 people at a country music concert in Las Vegas.\n\nCalin Hodges\u2019 planned mass execution was also reminiscent of Dylann Roof, who shot up Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C.\u2014the state where Junie and I grew up\u2014killing nine parishioners during a Wednesday-night Bible study.\n\nHeyward thwarted Hodges\u2019 copycat crime on Feb. 21\u2014at Mountain Top Faith Ministries\u2019 Wednesday-night Bible study.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJunie and I grew up like brothers along with another one of our friends, James Bond (no, that\u2019s not a nickname; James\u2019 nickname is 007, or \u201cDouble-O\u201d), who lived on the same street. The three of us were the rare few guys in our entire neighborhood to escape our surroundings and go to college. I somehow managed to get an academic scholarship. Double-O went into the Army and then to college. Junie attended college on a football scholarship and later moved to Las Vegas to play semipro football.\n\n\n\nThey were the cool guys. I was the nerd. They were both charismatic and athletic. I was the nerd. Our families attended the same church. We teased each other\u2019s sisters. We ate at each other\u2019s table. Junie was younger than us, but he was never afraid of shit, maybe because he was crazy. Or maybe because he\u2019s been built like a brick shithouse since he was about 8.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur only disagreement in life was when Junie informed me and Double-O that he was pledging Kappa. I\u2019m still disappointed in him for that. But he\u2019s still my play cousin. Plus, I\u2019ve never seen Junie shimmy.\n\nWhen I spoke to Junie, he told me he was definitely \u201cshook,\u201d but told me he couldn\u2019t reveal the details publicly because prosecutors had issued a gag order on the case. He also said that he thinks people need to hear the audio recordings so the public can know the kinds of people who have access to guns.\n\nWe rarely talk much these days, and to be honest, it\u2019s my fault. Whenever we have a conversation, it\u2019s because he occasionally reaches out to me to talk about something random. He now lives in Vegas and I live in Alabama, so we don\u2019t even get to see each other\u2019s families.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the last few years, we have seen each other a couple of times. His nephew was in a car accident a few miles from my home last year, and I made sure Junie\u2019s sister, mother and father were well-fed when they were in town. He called me when he was getting married, and we got the chance to hang out last summer. We were both in town on business, so we didn\u2019t spend a long time together.\n\nThe FBI reports that of the 104 active-shooter events between 2000 and 2012, 17 were stopped by potential victims. In 14 of those situations, the shooting was stopped by someone who was unarmed and managed to talk to the person or subdue the shooter with no weapon.\n\nOnly three active shooters were stopped by a good guy with a gun.\n\nI know Heyward Jackson Jr. and cannot imagine him being erased from the earth by a psychopath. Even worse, I can\u2019t fathom that someone would become a celebrity by killing my play cousin and lifelong friend. He is a father. He is a husband.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJunie Poonie is a good guy.\n\nHe did not have a gun.", "keywords": ["myth", "hodges", "shooter", "disproved", "mass", "guys", "good", "vegas", "las", "church", "guns", "know", "cousin", "stopped", "shooting", "play", "junie"], "polarity": 0.0872320768662232, "subjectivity": 0.46316298877274487},

High School, some 91 miles northwest of Atlanta.\n\nThe incident unfolded around 11:30 a.m. Wednesday after some students attempted to get into Randal Davidson\u2019s classroom, but he refused to let them in, Dalton police spokesperson Bruce Frazier confirmed.\n\nThe students told the principal, who then came to the door and started to use his key to open it; however, Davidson forced the door closed on the principal. It was at that point that the principal heard a gunshot, sending terrified students scattering.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe had officers inside the building quickly,\u201d Frazier said.\n\nOfficers evacuated a hallway and secured the area. One student was hurt during the evacuation and had to be treated for an ankle injury.\n\nSome 30-45 minutes after the shot went off, law enforcement got Davidson to surrender, and he was taken into custody.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve had any dealings with him before,\u201d Frazier said.\n\nDavidson was well-known as the longtime radio voice of Dalton High School football and basketball. The 53-year-old, who also teaches social studies, has been with Dalton High since 2004.\n\nFollowing the incident, students were relocated to the Northwest Georgia Trade and Convention Center, where parents and guardians were asked to pick them up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe terrifying incident at Dalton occurs some two weeks after 17 students and school employees were gunned down inside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland. That shooting has led to discussion about possibly arming teachers in the event of an active shooter situation, an idea endorsed by President Donald Trump.\n\nAlong those lines, the Florida House Appropriations Committee just recently approved training teachers to carry guns in class under the direction of local law enforcement, if school superintendents or school boards approve. The state\u2019s Senate Appropriations Committee gave the nod to a similar bill later the same day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut what if that armed teacher was, in fact, the aggressor instead of the savior?\n\nThe situation in Georgia could have ended a lot differently.

These people are scared of something\u2014irrelevance, anarchy, immigrants, black people, aliens, Black Panther Build-a-Bears\u2014and this fear drives them to amass arsenals and fight against even the idea of any sort of restriction. They attempt to spin this fear-based reluctance as a fight for their freedoms, but we don\u2019t believe them. They need more people.\n\n\n\nI addressed this dynamic two weeks ago when trying to make some sense out of Parkland, Fla.\u2014and Sandy Hook, and Columbine, and Las Vegas, and Orlando, Fla., and wherever the next mass shooting will happen:\n\nWe are surrounded, outnumbered, out-resourced and outgunned. Our entire existence here is a continual assault on our bodies. But we are the ones perceived to be the threats. We are the ones they\u2019re scared of. We are the ones who tell our children how to dress and how to wear their hair so they\u2019re not thought of as threats to them. We are the ones who consciously and subconsciously modify our voices and our behavior when forced to interact with them. We\u2019re the ones whom trained officers with weapons and badges and handcuffs and legal justifications are so damn scared of that we\u2019ve created entire curricula based on that fear, teaching ourselves what to do to seem less frightening to them. This fear is why they\u2019re so obsessed with arming themselves with multiple human killing machines. It\u2019s why they fight against even the notion of incremental disarmament so vehemently. They are scared shitless of us. Of anyone who is not them. And this fear is why our shitty gun laws exist, and it\u2019s why they will continue to.\n\nNaturally, there was some pushback from people who don\u2019t believe that fear\u2014specifically, fear possessed by white conservatives\u2014is what\u2019s driving our gun control problem. And some of their points and arguments were so compelling that I considered reconsidering.\n\nBut nah.\n\nFrom the Washington Post:\n\nKeeping ourselves and our loved ones safe from harm is perhaps our strongest human motivation, deeply embedded in our very DNA. It is so deep and important that it influences much of what we think and do, maybe more than we might expect. For example, over a decade now of research in political psychology consistently shows that how physically threatened or fearful a person feels is a key factor \u2014 although clearly not the only one \u2014 in whether he or she holds conservative or liberal attitudes. Conservatives, it turns out, react more strongly to physical threat than liberals do. In fact, their greater concern with physical safety seems to be determined early in life: In one University of California study, the more fear a 4-year-old showed in a laboratory situation, the more conservative his or her political attitudes were found to be 20 years later.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHmm.\n\nWith this in mind, John Bargh (the author of this piece) and three of his colleagues (Jaime Napier, Julie Huang and Andy Vonasch) conducted an experiment in which they turned conservatives into liberals by simply asking the conservatives to pretend that they weren\u2019t controlled by fear.\n\nBut before they answered the survey questions, we had them engage in an intense imagination exercise. They were asked to close their eyes and richly imagine being visited by a genie who granted them a superpower. For half of our participants, this superpower was to be able to fly, under one\u2019s own power. For the other half, it was to be completely physically safe, invulnerable to any harm.\n\nIf they had just imagined being able to fly, their responses to the social attitude survey showed the usual clear difference between Republicans and Democrats \u2014 the former endorsed more conservative positions on social issues and were also more resistant to social change in general. But if they had instead just imagined being completely physically safe, the Republicans became significantly more liberal \u2014 their positions on social attitudes were much more like the Democratic respondents. And on the issue of social change in general, the Republicans\u2019 attitudes were now indistinguishable from the Democrats.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBasically, if we could somehow find a way to convince conservatives not to be so fucking scared of every damn thing, they\u2019d be better people.\n\nThis seems like a daunting task. Perhaps even impossible. But if they were able to convince themselves that we\u2019re subhuman superpredators, it shouldn\u2019t be too hard to convince them that they\u2019re Black Panther.", "keywords": ["experiment", "theyre", "ones", "physically", "republicans", "proves", "fear", "baby", "snowflakes", "terrifies", "safe", "attitudes", "way", "conservatives", "little", "scared", "act", "social"], "polarity": 0.11385949441505, "subjectivity": 0.45019106407995285},

I thought we were going to do an explainer yesterday, but you seem so distracted. What\u2019s going on?\n\nI\u2019m sorry. I was keeping an eye on Florida\u2019s House of Representatives all day. House members passed a school-safety/gun control bill and sent it to the governor for his signature.\n\nThat\u2019s great! Maybe they\u2019ve finally seen the light and can pass legislation that will put a stop to all these mass shootings!\n\nI hear you, but this bill will probably mean more dead black kids.\n\nWait ... but you just said it\u2019s a gun control and school-safety law. By definition, that means it will control guns and make schools safe, right?\n\nThis is Florida, man. You can buy a boa constrictor at a convenience store in Florida. Don\u2019t forget, the 9/11 hijackers took flying lessons in Florida and it didn\u2019t raise any red flags when they told their instructor, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about the landing part.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNothing in Florida makes any sense.\n\nThe Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act raises the minimum age to buy a weapon to 18, allows citizens to \u201cred flag\u201d people with mental health problems and enacts a three-day waiting period on most weapons, all of which are needed. But it does nothing to curb the sale of military-style weapons. It does not close loopholes regarding purchasing guns at gun shows or in private sales.\n\nBut even more troubling than the previously mentioned exemptions, the new law creates a program that will result in armed school employees.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy is that a bad thing? You know what they say: The only person who can stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.\n\nFirst of all, almost every legitimate study shows that when more guns are present, more people die. A 2015 study of FBI and national crime by the Violence Policy Center (pdf) concluded that people are more likely to cause an accidental death than prevent a crime when pulling a gun in self-defense. The Washington Post reports that for every justifiable homicide using a gun, there are 34 criminal homicides, 78 gun suicides and two accidental deaths. A 2013 study by the FBI (pdf) even shows that more active shooters are stopped by unarmed citizens.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, no one ever says that thing about \u201cbad guys with guns being stopped by good guys with guns.\u201d It\u2019s a National Rifle Association marketing slogan. But then again, I\u2019ve also never seen anyone eating a Chicken McNugget while muttering the catchphrase, \u201cI\u2019m lovin\u2019 it!\u201d\n\nBut you said black kids will die. How do you figure that?\n\nBecause I trust these little-known, seldom-used things called \u201cfacts.\u201d\n\nFor instance, a study by Ohio State University revealed that black students receive harsher punishments than white kids for the same relatively minor infractions. Federal data shows that teachers and schools are four times more likely to suspend black students. Research by the American Psychological Association shows that even away from school, people with darker skin are perceived as bigger, stronger and more threatening than white people the same size.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo whom do you think gun-toting school employees are more likely to shoot?\n\nBlack kids. But I\u2019ve read a little about this legislation. It proposes training, mental health evaluations and drug screenings. Wouldn\u2019t that help?\n\nHas training, drug screenings and mental health evaluations stopped police from killing black people disproportionately?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGood point. But what about the fact that they could go to jail for shooting the wrong kid? You\u2019ve gotta admit that the law wouldn\u2019t shield anyone from prosecution.\n\nHow is that different from any other self-protection legislation like Florida\u2019s \u201cStand your ground\u201d law? In a \u201cStand your ground\u201d study that looked solely at cases in Florida, researchers discovered that between 2005 and 2013, Florida juries were twice as likely to convict the perpetrator of a crime against a white person as they were to convict in a crime against a person of color.\n\n\u201cThese results are similar to pre-civil-rights-era statistics, with strict enforcement for crimes when the victim was white and less-rigorous enforcement with the victim is nonwhite,\u201d the report said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you give anyone the legal authority to shoot people, they are always going to shoot black people.\n\nDamn. So if this data is readily available, why would they consider such a stupid law?\n\nBecause Florida legislators don\u2019t care about dead bodies as much as they care about the buckets of cash from the NRA. It\u2019s why the homicide rate has surged 22 percent since the state passed the \u201cStand your ground\u201d law. It\u2019s why Sen. Marco Rubio stood in front of a Parkland, Fla., shooting survivor and explained his loyalty to the NRA by explaining that \u201cpeople buy into\u201d his agenda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo black students are in a lot of danger, huh?\n\nIt\u2019s not just the students. It\u2019s the black school employees, too. The Florida law doesn\u2019t arm classroom teachers, but it allows all of the other school workers to carry weapons if their school district opts in. Traditionally, black people carrying concealed weapons haven\u2019t fared so well, even if the gun is legal.\n\nIn fact, I read a story a couple of years ago about a black school employee who carried a legal firearm. He was a lunchroom worker. He was stopped by the cops, and he informed the officer that he was licensed to carry. I think his name was Philando Castile.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can\u2019t recall how that situation ended up, but I\u2019m sure everything turned out OK.\n\nUmmm ... I think you should go back and ... you know what? Never mind. Look, I know it\u2019s Florida, but come on man. It couldn\u2019t be that bad. Maybe you\u2019re wrong about how dangerous this could turn out to be.\n\nPerhaps. After all, there\u2019s no way the state of Florida would allow an adult to shoot an innocent black kid and get away with it. Especially if the kid wasn\u2019t involved in any kind of crime or threatening the life of anyone around him. That would be incredibly racist. Maybe I\u2019m just overreacting. I probably should call someone who would know better.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWould you happen to have a phone number for George Zimmerman?", "keywords": ["gun", "students", "law", "white", "dead", "black", "means", "guns", "study", "crime", "florida", "teachers", "school", "explained", "armed", "shows"], "polarity": 0.0388758116883117, "subjectivity": 0.46734356210918687},

When a Twitter user questioned whether the NRA\u2019s slow, lukewarm responses to Castile\u2019s death had to do with his race, Loesch replied, \u201cHe was also in possession of a controlled substance and a firearm simultaneously, which is illegal.\u201d (Castile and his fiancee had smoked weed prior to being pulled over, and Yanez claimed that his rash, deadly response was because he smelled weed in the car.)\n\nValerie Castile has forgotten none of it.\n\n\u201cMy son was one of the good guys, but him being black, obviously they didn\u2019t see him as a good guy,\u201d she told the Daily News.

However, in recent days, students Josh Gallagher and Connor Dietrich are refuting that narrative, both expressing disgust toward Gard on Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Twitter, Gallagher wrote that Gard \u201ccalled himself a hero, and ... the media portrayed him as a hero when in reality he is the opposite.\u201d\n\nGallagher said that he was in Gard\u2019s class when the fire alarm went off and students started filing out. Then they heard gunshots, and about 15 of them stopped in their tracks before running back toward the classroom. At that point, however, Gard locked the door and refused to let them back in, Gallagher said.\n\n\u201cWe were stuck in the hall for four total minutes, ducking and in fear for our lives,\u201d Gallagher wrote. He said that another teacher eventually let him and the other students into another classroom, but the teen said that Gard \u201cleft 75% of his students out in the hallway to be slaughtered.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGard, for his part, did a phone interview with CBS Miami while he and some of the students were still sheltered in his classroom, less than two hours after the shooting, awaiting the all-clear from police.\n\nGallagher pointed out that the teacher had been interviewed by multiple media outlets as a hero.\n\n\u201cHe is nothing but a coward,\u201d Gallagher said. \u201cHe has revictimized the students he left out of his class by calling himself a hero.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDietrich, who was one of the kids left in the hallway, told a similar story.\n\n\u201cAs one of the kids left in the hallway I want people to understand how terrifying and defenseless I personally felt,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cThe person I had to rely on left us to die and that\u2019s not okay.\u201d\n\nGard, meanwhile, said that he was just following protocol that mandated all doors be kept locked during an active-shooter drill or real-life emergency. He told the Sun-Sentinel that he was surprised that a student and his father were upset after the fact.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI looked back down the hall and no one was around\u2014no one,\u201d Gard said, acknowledging that 13 students had lagged behind and had wound up being locked out. \u201cYou have to close the door. That\u2019s protocol. We have no choice.\u201d\n\nGard said that he and the students who had gotten into the classroom were huddled in the dark by the desk when they heard loud banging on the door. He said that by the time he walked over to the door (an action he said was also prohibited), the banging had stopped.\n\n\u201cFast-forward to Sunday, when the parents came back for an open house,\u201d he added. \u201cAll of a sudden, this kid comes over and starts screaming at me.

(insert next city here). Very few have called it a terrorism-related incident.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Justice, a terrorist activity is defined, in part, as:\n\nThe use of any\u2014 (a) biological agent, chemical agent, or nuclear weapon or device, or (b) explosive, firearm, or other weapon or dangerous device (other than for mere personal monetary gain), with intent to endanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals or to cause substantial damage to property.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe same legal explanation (pdf) defines a terrorist organization as \u201ca group of two or more individuals, whether organized or not, which engages in, or has a subgroup which engages in, the activities described.\u201d\n\nThe latest tragedy is directly related to our government\u2019s unwillingness to create and enforce commonsense gun laws, fueled by a criminal cabal that bribes lawmakers with barrels of cash and knowingly promotes and participates in a plot that results in the deaths of seven children every day.\n\nThe National Rifle Association kills people.\n\nThe advocates for the NRA will tell you that its only intent is to protect our Second Amendment right to own firearms. Whether or not you agree with the conservative translation of the Second Amendment, there is no doubt that the NRA\u2019s belief that every American has an unassailable right to own a gun has morphed into a semireligious philosophy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NRA\u2019s unrelenting fight against commonsense gun regulation is based on that philosophy in the same way that Nazis want to rid the world of nonwhites, and religious extremists believe that people who don\u2019t adhere to their theological philosophy should perish from the earth.\n\nIn America, it should never be illegal to believe in these things. But when these individuals form groups that engage in activities that \u201cendanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals\u201d\u2014whether it is flying a plane into a New York City building or driving a car through anti-racism protesters at a Charlottesville, Va. rally\u2014it rises to the legal definition of terrorism.\n\nThe NRA is a terrorist organization.\n\nOn Oct. 16, 2017, the city of Newark, N.J., announced a federal lawsuit against 10 drug companies that manufacture prescription opioids. In December, five suburban Illinois counties followed suit. By January, New York City, the largest city in America, did the same.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNone of these lawsuits argue that the pharmaceutical companies involved have sold defective products. Instead, they allege that the corporations that sell and market these drugs to consumers have knowingly engaged in practices that allow an otherwise legal product to end up in the wrong hands, resulting in an epidemic of addiction and death for which the public has paid the price. Therefore, the suits allege, the companies are\u2014at the very least\u2014partially responsible.\n\nThis has worked before. The 1998 Master Settlement Agreement forced tobacco manufacturers to pay $206 billion for tobacco-related deaths and illnesses. The companies also had to stop targeting youths, restrict advertising, and enact policies so that cigarettes and tobacco products wouldn\u2019t end up in the hands of children. The case revealed that Big Tobacco had covered up the dangers of its products for years by uniting to lobby lawmakers with billions of dollars and obscuring data about its poisonous product.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSounds a lot like the gun industry.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more people died from gun deaths in 2016 (38,658) than from prescription opioids (around 14,400). And 13,686 of the people killed by guns that year were under the age of 19. Even if you believe in the premise of self-protection or \u201chaters gonna hate, thugs gonna thug,\u201d when you extract the criminal element from total gun deaths, 495 of those deaths were unintentional, and another 22,938 were suicides.\n\nThe grand total of U.S. deaths from terrorism and extremist activities over the last decade is 71.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, if you added up the numbers of every American casualty of terrorism since 1865, the numbers of gun deaths in 2016 alone would dwarf it.\n\nThere is no doubt that guns are a worse problem than terrorism in America. The ease of acquiring firearms causes thousands of needless deaths in the U.S. It is a fact that states with large-capacity-magazine bans have fewer firearm-related deaths. In our examination of mass-shooting deaths, The Root found that 253 people were killed by semi-automatic assault-style weapons since 1966.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though polls show that 90 percent of Americans have no problem with mandated background checks as a prerequisite to purchasing a gun, the NRA opposes it. According to Gallup, 8 in 10 Americans favor legislation banning assault-style weapons, but the NRA fights against it. Eighty-two percent of those polled favor outlawing attachments that allow guns to fire rapidly, but the NRA lobbies against the effort.\n\nThe NRA\u2019s crusade against gun reform has nothing to do with the will of the people. It is an ideological war that kills and injures thousands of innocent people every year. It is based on a fundamentalist interpretation of the Second Amendment not shared by the American people.\n\nIt is terrorism.\n\nIn the same way that most Muslims don\u2019t support al-Qaida or the Islamic State group, and the majority of white people don\u2019t support the neo-Nazi movement or the Ku Klux Klan, most people who own firearms don\u2019t support the National Rifle Association. The NRA is not some loose confederation of well-intentioned gun owners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though the organization claims to have 5 million members (a figure that many are skeptical of), that seemingly large number accounts for only 1.5 percent of the U.S. population and less than 7 percent of gun owners. That means that 98.8 percent of the country, and 93 percent of the people who legally own firearms, want nothing to do with the NRA.\n\n\n\nAccording to OpenSecrets.org, the NRA spent an average of $3 million on lobbying in each of the past five years. This money does not come from members of the NRA\u2014it comes from gun manufacturers who give tens of million of dollars to the organization through a variety of means, including donations, sponsorship programs, advertising and revenue sharing. Taurus automatically purchases an NRA membership for every customer who buys one of its guns. Sturm, Ruger gives $1 from every purchase to the NRA.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c ...with intent to endanger, directly or indirectly, the safety of one or more individuals ... \u201d\n\nThe gun debate has never been about the Second Amendment. Most politicians, lawyers and legal experts agree that the right to bear arms will never be revoked. The real question is about America\u2019s unwillingness to regulate the gun industry and the NRA\u2019s ability to escape the same scrutiny as entities in similarly dangerous fields of commerce.\n\n\n\nAttorney Leslie Thompson, who works with companies on the legal protection of consumer products, told The Root: \u201cThe NRA and gun manufacturers have one advantage that the tobacco and pharmaceutical industries don\u2019t have: the Second Amendment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut the ability to exercise a constitutional right can be regulated,\u201d Thompson explained, noting that age and ID requirements are required to vote. \u201cEven the right to freedom of speech is subject to slander and libel laws to prevent fellow citizens from being recklessly injured.\u201d\n\nAlthough lawmakers, careless gun owners and retail outlets are not faultless in the scourge of firearm-related deaths that plague this country, the uniquely American epidemic of murders, mass shootings, accidents and suicides points back to this singular organization that has prioritized its fundamentalist ideology over the pain and suffering of the citizens of this country.\n\n\n\nThe NRA\u2019s complicity in thousands of deaths every year is directly related to the amount of money it funnels from gun manufacturers to lawmakers. If the public found out that another organization with the body count of the NRA was lobbying politicians and writing laws, there would be a national scandal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe National Rifle Association should not be exempt. It is more powerful and scarier than al-Qaida and the \u201calt-right\u201d combined. The trite aphorism used most often by the organization that has become a willful accessory to thousands of American murders explains it best:\n\nGuns don\u2019t kill people ...\n\nThe NRA does.", "keywords": ["gun", "right", "dont", "legal", "deaths", "organization", "second", "directly", "nras", "terrorist", "nra"], "polarity": 0.06106391924573743, "subjectivity": 0.4029339852067124},

Your activism has already impacted this country and will likely save lives. When I saw that Walmart announced that it would allow only people age 21 or over to purchase firearms, I was flabbergasted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have to admit that I initially doubted how effective your efforts could be in the war against Murder Incorporated the National Rifle Association, mostly because I think NRA Executive Vice President and CEO Wayne LaPierre is actually a demon-possessed hobgoblin inhabiting the body of an incubus tucked inside a human exoskeleton that survives by devouring the souls of bullet-riddled babies, so I figured you\u2019d lose the stare-down because ... well ... I don\u2019t think Satan blinks.\n\nI figured, if a Newtown, Conn., elementary school full of dead babies didn\u2019t defeat the NRA, then no one could. But I was wrong! In my naivete, I forgot that the power of whiteness is the only thing more powerful than wheelbarrows full of cash that politicians like Sen. Marco Rubio are willing to accept in exchange for the corpses of high school sophomores. You\u2019re actually changing the world!\n\nBut now that it looks as if you are on the path to success, I\u2019d like for you to continue your efforts. Since it seems like America is much more willing to listen with an open mind when white kids say things, I have a list of five things we\u2019d like for you to put on your agenda when you\u2019re finished with the gun laws.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am authorized to offer you an unprecedented lifetime invitation to the cookout, excluding the annual celebration in Wakanda (I\u2019m sure you understand: T\u2019Challa issued an executive order that\u2019s essentially a white-people travel ban), if you are able to accomplish all five of these goals:\n\n1. Remember how black America acted after the Parkland, Fla., massacre.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to steal your thunder because ultimately, your cause will help black people, just as we believe that our fight against state violence and police brutality will also impact white communities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut did you notice that black America didn\u2019t dismiss your efforts by asking about white-on-white crime? Could you ask your fellow Caucasians to note how\u2014every time someone mentions gun violence\u2014we don\u2019t bring up Parkland? Or Columbine, Colo.? Or Las Vegas? Or Sutherland Springs, Texas?\n\nCould they at least jot down how, whether we agreed with you or not, we simply addressed the specific issue instead of deflecting?\n\n2. Instead of Glocks, can we get some other stuff?\n\nIf they plan on addressing the gun control issue by arming teachers, we, of the black delegation, will pass on the offer. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s a bad idea. But when you look at black communities and the number of kids who have already died from gunfire, the fact that some teachers might have mental issues, the fact that some cops won\u2019t go into a school with a mass shooter but we expect teachers to do so, and the weirdness of my 11th-grade civics teacher, Mr. Heisman ... OK, maybe I am calling it a bad idea.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA really terrible idea.\n\nBut since black schools receive less funding than predominantly white schools, we\u2019ll take some books. A nice handgun costs about the same as an inexpensive laptop, and black students suffer from a gap in access to technology, so we\u2019ll take the laptops instead of the firearms.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering how this will make the world a better place, just think how lit Black Twitter will be!\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. If you can force companies to change their gun policies, maybe you can force them to change other things.\n\nI was amazed that you convinced Walmart to change its policy on gun sales. In your next meeting, could you tell them to change their policy on how many cashiers they have working at one time? I\u2019ve been in Walmart on Christmas Eve and they still didn\u2019t have a cashier at every register, which might be worse than Republicans ignoring the fact that guns kill more Americans every year than AIDS, terrorists, \u201cblack identity extremists\u201d and Shariah combined.\n\nDelta eliminated its NRA discount but still charges $30 to put my bag under the plane, yet it lets me stuff the bag in an overhead bin for free. It\u2019s on the same plane! How is this not illegal? And, like Wally World, airports never have a full staff of Transportation Security Administration agents. Half the check-in lines are never used!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s clear that America needs some commonsense line-control legislation.\n\n4. As long as we\u2019re working on fixing laws that kill people, we have a list:\n\nmarijuana prohibition\n\n\n\ncops being prosecuted by people who are essentially co-workers\n\nmandatory minimums\n\nstop-and-frisk laws\n\npharmaceutical-industry loopholes\n\ngerrymandering legislation\n\nfelon disenfranchisement\n\nFDA legislation that allows white people to make potato salad\n\ncapital punishment\n\n5. Can you never say \u201cAll lives matter\u201d ever again?\n\nAgain, I applaud your efforts, and would never try to denigrate the terrific work you have been doing. Ultimately, we are all on the same side: the not-getting-shot-in-the-face side.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I\u2019d like to point out that black and brown activists have been asking for these same proposals for years. We have spoken about the ease of buying weapons, about the lack of commonsense gun laws and how they disproportionately affect black and brown communities.\n\nEven when white America talks about black people\u2019s need to focus on \u201cblack-on-black crime\u201d before we are allowed to address any issue slightly adjacent to racism, it never raises the prospect of confronting the terrorist organization known as the NRA. It never attributes the gun violence in Chicago to lack of mental health care or access to firearms.\n\nIt is obvious that dead black children like Hadiya Pendleton, who are gunned down on inner-city streets, are not worth as much as their white counterparts who die in suburban schools. But when white America reflexively responds to \u201cBlack lives matter\u201d with that bullshit about \u201call lives,\u201d could you point back to your laudable efforts and explain how the outrage over white lives changed the national conversation, the policies of international corporations and possibly the stranglehold of the most powerful lobbying group in America?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile it might be true that all lives matter, this country\u2019s response to the loss of black lives has never been this vehemently loud and effective.\n\nNot like this.\n\nNever like this.\n\nP.S.

That shooting has led to discussion about possibly arming teachers in the event of an active shooter situation, an idea endorsed by President Donald Trump.\n\nAlong those lines, the Florida House Appropriations Committee just recently approved training teachers to carry guns in class under the direction of local law enforcement, if school superintendents or school boards approve. The state\u2019s Senate Appropriations Committee gave the nod to a similar bill later the same day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut what if that armed teacher was, in fact, the aggressor instead of the savior?\n\nThe situation in Georgia could have ended a lot differently.

Kuhn-Fricker alerted the principal of the high school that her daughter and Nicholas attended, warning the administrator of the violent account, according to the Washington Post.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe also staged an intervention with her daughter, seemingly convincing her to break up with the 17-year-old boy. Days later, Nicholas would kill her and her husband, Scott Fricker, in their home in Reston, Va., according to police.\n\nNow HuffPost has revealed the Twitter account Nicholas reportedly used, providing stark details about the nature of his beliefs and inspirations. The Twitter handle, @doctorpepper35, under the name Kevin Gallo, has since been suspended, but the HuffPost article contains several screenshot captures from the account.\n\nFrom HuffPost:\n\nAlmost three months before the murders, the teenager from Lorton, Va., praised a book called Siege, an obscure, ominous work written by James Mason, a neo-Nazi devotee of Charles Manson. The 1992 book, republished last year by hyperviolent white nationalist sect Atomwaffen Division, is essentially a call to \u201cHelter Skelter\u201d racist insurrection. Giampa also retweeted an endorsement of The Turner Diaries, William Luther Pierce\u2019s infamous white nationalist novel about race war, often found on the bookshelf of American domestic terrorists.\ufeff\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNicholas saved the worst attacks for Jews, Muslims and members of the LGTBQ community:\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve already talked 1 tranny into suicide and I\u2019m working on another 2 \ud83d\ude33,\u201d he bragged. Then he posted a rainbow lynching image, encouraging gay and transgender people to commit suicide. \u201c#transrightsarehumanrights is an oxymoron because trannies aren\u2019t \u2018people,\u2019\u201d Giampa tweeted that day.\ufeff\n\nAnd this:\n\nA white Europe without Jewish or Muslim individuals \u201csounds like heaven,\u201d Giampa tweeted on Nov. 11. The next day, he tweeted \u201cThe jews are everyone\u2019s enemy.\u201d He tweeted in support of nationalist marchers in Poland seeking to rid the country of Muslims and Jews. \u201cMuslims and jews are incapable of assimilating and a threat to their culture,\u201d he wrote.\ufeff\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs HuffPost shows, leading up to the double murder, Nicholas openly identified as a Nazi, retweeted pro-Hitler memes, and called for various neo-Nazi and white nationalist groups to come together as part of a \u201cwhite revolution.\u201d\n\nHis social media track record is disturbing, but in a way that has become increasingly familiar.\n\nThis is the part of the HuffPost report that has me messed up:\n\n\u201cI apologize for all the unhappiness for everyone. I am sincerely sorry,\u201d said one of Giampa\u2019s family members, who broke into tears on the phone. \u201cIn the end, we need one more gun law. Any address, anywhere, that has mental illness, there cannot be guns.\u201d\ufeff\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet me first say this: Nicholas and his girlfriend did go to a private high school for students with special needs, according to HuffPost. The nature and extent of his mental or behavioral issues is still largely unknown.\n\nBut it\u2019s dangerous and irresponsible to isolate Nicholas\u2019 \u201cmental illness\u201d as the reason for the cold-blooded murder he\u2019s accused of\u2014not when he publicly and loudly voiced his desire to exterminate entire groups of people.\n\nThis is a young man who mowed a 40-foot swastika into a community field in his neighborhood. A young man whose mother, who reportedly voiced support for Confederate generals and monuments on her Facebook page, took her son to a gun range to fire a submachine gun. A young man who unabashedly praised murderers and dictators and called for race wars.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are some psychiatrists who believe that \u201cextreme racism\u201d is, in fact, a mental illness. But to blame mental illness for gun violence is just incorrect: As CNN reports, studies have shown that \u201cthe vast majority of people with severe mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or severe depression, are no more likely to be violent than anyone else.\u201d\n\nIn fact, people suffering from severe mental illness are 10 times more likely to be victims of violent crime.\n\nWhich is what makes the quote from Nicholas\u2019 family member so appalling, even as a part of me understands the desire to protect a loved one by branding him a tragic example of mental illness gone unchecked. It preserves, to some degree, his innocence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe problem is that this desire obscures who Nicholas really is, who he proclaimed himself over and over to be. And an unwillingness to see that\u2014to listen when the monster tells you his name\u2014all but guarantees that more of the same will continue.\n\nRead more at HuffPost.", "keywords": ["teen", "identifies", "charged", "white", "tweeted", "twitter", "disturbing", "illness", "gun", "tied", "neonazi", "huffpost", "jews", "young", "murder", "mental", "nationalist", "heres", "nicholas"], "polarity": -0.03765458422174841, "subjectivity": 0.44691186922530185},

I absolutely get that jobs are scarce and nice checks for those who truly \u201cstarted from the bottom, now we\u2019re here\u201d are extremely rare. But sometimes, wanting to stay out of the unemployment line can go too far. Just think about how many people you know who have checked out at their jobs because it\u2019s just easier to go along to get along.\n\n\n\nSo when I attended the Atlanta Hawks\u2019 diversity-inclusion symposium, MOSAIC (Model of Shaping Atlanta Through Inclusive Conversations), last week, I really expected Hill to continue walking the \u201cjust trying to keep my job\u201d tone of her statement. In my experience, many companies do these events just to look like they\u2019re doing something. Rarely are real issues even touched. The conversation usually reinforces what companies want to hear and not what employees of color\u2014black employees especially\u2014really experience, which is everything but diverse and inclusive. Plus, given MOSAIC\u2019s origins, I just didn\u2019t expect to hear anything out of the norm.\n\n\n\nMOSAIC, which you\u2019ve probably never heard of before now, is one of the initiatives the Atlanta Hawks created in response to their own racist mini scandal back in 2014, when racially disparaging comments from Danny Ferry\u2014the former Duke standout (enough said)\u2014and emails from then-Hawks co-owner Bruce Levenson surfaced. Ferry\u2019s comments centered on NBA forward Luol Deng\u2019s African heritage, while Levenson\u2019s emails basically argued that Hawks fans were too black and \u201cthat the black crowd scared away the whites and there are simply not enough affluent black fans to build a sign[i]ficant season ticket base.\u201d\n\n\n\nToday there\u2019s a new ownership group with former Duke and NBA player Grant Hill as a partner. Plus they hired Nzinga \u201cZing\u201d Shaw, as the NBA\u2019s first-ever chief diversity and inclusion officer. They\u2019ve also put on MOSAIC annually since 2016, and for this third year they tapped Hill to give the keynote address with \u201cDisruption\u201d as its theme.\n\nKicking off her address, Hill joked about spending time in Belize and zip-lining for the first time before easing into the White House calling her \u201cDonald Trump is a white supremacist\u201d tweet \u201ca fireable offense\u201d during a press briefing, backed by the man himself on Twitter, of course.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd in case there is anyone who thinks that no one is still riding for Trump, Hill made it clear that they are by sharing details of the snail mail of hate she received along with the social media abuse. \u201cI got called the n-word so much that I thought it was my middle name,\u201d she candidly revealed.\n\n\n\nAll of this happened as Hill was still warming her seat at ESPN\u2019s iconic SportsCenter, dubbed SC6 when she and her longtime co-host, Michael Smith, from the successful His & Hers show, took over in February 2017. ESPN didn\u2019t fire Hill or suspend her for those Trump tweets; rather, the sports network suspended her for another series of tweets in October 2017 that alluded to boycotting Dallas Cowboys advertisers in response to team owner Jerry Jones\u2019 promise to bench players who \u201cdisrespect the flag.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn Atlanta, Hill reiterated that the suspension was justified, noting that \u201cESPN is in the business of sports\u201d and \u201cnot in the business necessarily of being construed as a political organization and I put them firmly in those crosshairs.\u201d She also insisted that it was her decision to leave SC6 and join ESPN microsite The Undefeated to resume her writing career, with hosting TV specials and even creating her own video content as part of the deal.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI never intended to be a disruptor,\u201d she told the crowd. \u201cI never intended to be thrust into a role of activism,\u201d she added, noting that \u201cI didn\u2019t choose the moment; the moment chose me.\u201d\n\nMy worst fears about Hill giving up the fight like so many others whose outspokenness resulted in hard consequences seemed confirmed until she switched it up. As she took on the topics of disruption, diversity and inclusion, she spoke directly to those in hiring positions, who are still overwhelmingly white and male, informing them that people of color and women are experiencing this new old America in ways they can\u2019t even begin to imagine.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn whatever business that you\u2019re in, especially if you\u2019re a woman and you\u2019re a person of color, there\u2019s a level of vulnerability that you feel right now that may be hard for everybody to relate to. You feel a little scared and under attack right now under some of the current policies and tone that our country has taken,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGetting even more real, Hill confessed that, in the current Trump climate and after Charlottesville, Va., especially, there were days she didn\u2019t even want to come to work. \u201cFor the first time in my career,\u201d she admitted, \u201cit kind of put my dual role of person and journalist in conflict with one another.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI never intended to be a disruptor. I never intended to be thrust into a role of activism. I didn\u2019t choose the moment; the moment chose me.\u201d\n\nShe also let those in power know that the solution to diversity and inclusion issues didn\u2019t rest with those of us who didn\u2019t create the problem in the first place, and that hiring some of us was only the first step. \u201cGetting through the door is just one of the problems that needs to be addressed,\u201d she explained. \u201cWe all know there are definitely structures that need to change from a tangible standpoint. We need more women, we need more people of color, you need more LGBTQ people. We know that, but once they make it through the door, then what happens?\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSugarcoating was not on the menu as Hill shared that, in her 20-year career, she knew what it meant to just be a quota. \u201cI\u2019ve had the experience of being wanted for what I represent but not really wanted for what I represent,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what I mean about the difference about once you\u2019re actually through that door.\u201d She added:\n\n\n\nBecause you can talk a lot about wanting us at the table, but will you listen to us once we\u2019re actually in the room? Will you groom and mentor us the way you would somebody that looks like you? Will you invite us to come play golf? Will you invite us out to drinks so that we can network with key people? Will you recommend us for assignments that challenge and grow us? Will you promote us? Fast-track us? Treat us like franchise players and not just sixth men or sixth women that are on the bench? Will you give us credit when we deserve it, even it means that you get a little less credit?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrue diversity and inclusion gets uncomfortable, she said, and companies need to be clear about whether they really want to deal with that:\n\nWhen you start disrupting what your organization looks like, when it starts changing, and it\u2019s very emblematic of what\u2019s happening in this country right now, when the progressiveness gets a little too fast for people, a little too uncomfortable, when they start thinking that someone else\u2019s ascension or having different people in the room is going to mean less for them, then you get the blowback, then you get the brushback, and then you get the criticism, and then you get people who are angry and mad at you, and you have to make that decision in that moment: Am I here to support the people who are mad over really nothing, or am I here to support the people who have never gotten this opportunity or rarely get it?\n\nThe answer to the second half of that question, she said, has largely been a resounding \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou find in a lot of places\u2014they\u2019re more concerned about the people who are mad as opposed to the people they need to welcome,\u201d she explained. \u201cAnd so, if you\u2019re in charge and you\u2019re a thought leader, you have to really be honest with yourself about what you have the stomach to do, especially in tumultuous times.\u201d\n\n\n\nOne of my colleagues, who has seen Hill speak since this whole \u201cTrump is a white supremacist\u201d water-is-wet nonscandal, chastised me for even doubting the \u201cDetroit vs. Everybody\u201d native. So don\u2019t let the headlines sway you as they did me; please know that Hill is still spitting pure truth about what\u2019s really going down for us in this country.", "keywords": ["whats", "white", "spitting", "truth", "hill", "going", "youre", "america", "didnt", "jemele", "trump", "know", "little", "really", "moment", "need"], "polarity": 0.07532926669290302, "subjectivity": 0.5085638856093402},

To be a black man is to learn how to make yourself small at an early age. It is to constantly crumple yourself up into something ... anything smaller and less threatening. It is to bridle your tongue and stifle your intelligence. Any black man who says he has never done it is a liar.\n\nOr dead.\n\nTo be a black woman is to exist where you are always told to be quiet while always being told how loud you are. To have volume or confidence equated with bitterness or belligerence. To clothe and carry the entire planet on your shoulder, and to not even be allowed to grunt, lest you be laden with the title of \u201cangry.\u201d\n\nBut most of all, to be black in America is to embrace acceptance. Acceptance of the fact that\u2014even when you are home\u2014you are never home. There is no such thing as home for you. There is no such thing as safety for you. Even when you are home, you are not safe. Or free. Or anything. Just black.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd that is life.\n\nToday, The Atlantic published an article by conservative writer David French about the culture of gun ownership. It is a thoughtful piece on how he first came to experience being a gun owner (when a man who seems to be a stalker showed up at French\u2019s house and the school that French\u2019s children attended).\n\nWhy I Carry a Gun I'm left with the burning conviction that my family and community are safer and freer because\u2026 Read more Read\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe writer goes on to explain how guns make him feel safer in his home. How he felt the first time he fired his weapon at a range. How he obtained a permit to carry his weapon around with him at all times. French wrapped up his foray into becoming a \u201cgun guy\u201d this way:\n\nAt the end of this process, your life has changed for the better. Your community has expanded to include people you truly like, who\u2019ve perhaps helped you through a tough time in your life, and you treasure these relationships. You feel a sense of burning conviction that you, your family, and your community are safer and freer because you own and carry a gun.\n\nThere was nothing inherently conservative or offensive about his argument. It was relatably rational. His attempt to explain the other side of gun ownership was reasonable, except for one part:\n\nThe part where people die.\n\nIn fact, if every gun proposal being argued about right now passed tomorrow, David French could build a time machine, buy some Apple stock for me (I mean ... he\u2019s already going, right?), go back to the moment he decided to purchase a firearm and do it all again. French didn\u2019t buy an assault weapon. He\u2019s over 21. He\u2019s not mentally disturbed. He doesn\u2019t mention anything about owning an extended clip or a bump stock.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, his entire argument in defense of gun owners who are opposed to commonsense gun reform is, \u201cBut we like it, so ... \u201d\n\nAnd after all, isn\u2019t that essentially what privilege is and always has been? On the great American balance scale, even the feelings of white men are worth more than the lives of anyone else. David French deserves to feel safe. David French deserves his security. Don\u2019t mess with his culture. You couldn\u2019t even understand.\n\nEven if it kills someone else.\n\nI\u2019ve always wondered how it must feel to live in a world where I was endowed with the expectation that the planet should bend to my will. I\u2019d love to believe that my principled stance that affects my life in no way whatsoever is more important than not having a ninth-grader\u2019s brains splattered in language arts class. His parents worry, too. But privileged, unreasonable gun nuts and David French say: \u201cFuck them! I\u2019d rather see babies die than have to wait three days for a background check. I want my killing machine now!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUltimately, neither the article nor French\u2019s stance is surprising. They don\u2019t even anger me because I have known many men, black and white, who have tucked their piece of mind into holsters, waistbands or the smalls of their backs, whether legally or illegally. But his entire defense rests on the premise that we simply cannot understand how gun owners\u2019 belief in their own bravery and courage could prevent mass shooters. \u201cThe formula is simple: Criminals and the dangerously mentally ill make our nation more violent,\u201d French writes. \u201cLaw-abiding gun owners save and protect lives.\u201d\n\nLet us be clear: That is a lie. Almost every study ever done shows that the more guns present\u2014legal or illegal\u2014the more unsafe people actually are. But you know ... it\u2019s his \u201cculture.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd the ironic part is that I, too, am a gun owner. I also believe in the Second Amendment. Like French, I want to protect myself and my family. But unlike French, I am not willing to do so at the expense of the lives of others.\n\nI often wonder what it\u2019s like to feel that safe. To believe that you have a right\u2014not just to be safe\u2014but to feel safe. To be cradled by the world as it stomps on the skull of anyone who opposes you.\n\nTo feel at home. To not have to live in the constant duality of being perceived as a threat and always being threatened. To not have to instinctively calculate a slower walking cadence when you encounter white women in dark parking lots so they won\u2019t feel as if you\u2019re following them. To not feel the \u201ctha-dump\u201d in your heartbeat when you see flashing lights in the rearview mirror as a cop follows you\u2014even when you\u2019ve done nothing wrong. To not be folded. To not be crumpled. To be straight.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be the danger but never safe. Never home. ...

Speaking on the floor during the session, Florida state Sen. Oscar Braynon told the room that \u201cthe talk\u201d he gave his young boys would have to be updated.\n\n\n\nBefore, the talk on how to behave around armed authority figures centered on cops. Now it would include teachers.\n\n\u201cIt bothers me to think, as a father of two young boys, to tell them to not be aggressive to your teacher,\u201d Braynon said, according to the Sun-Sentinel. \u201cPlease don\u2019t make it dangerous for children who look like my children to go to school.\u201d\n\nHis colleagues in the Florida state Senate didn\u2019t seem to be listening.\n\nA half-dozen Democratic amendments for gun reform were voted down at the Florida Legislature on Monday, including the reform most sought-after by Parkland, Fla., student activists: a ban on all assault weapons. Instead, lawmakers approved proposals that included raising the age limit on firearm sales from 18 to 21, banning the sale of bump stocks and enacting the Florida sheriff\u2019s Marshal Program, which would allow educators to carry firearms in school.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Sun-Sentinel outlines the particulars of the controversial program:\n\nThose who elect to participate in the program would have to go through 132 hours of training after a background check, psychological exam and drug screening. Both a school district superintendent and a county sheriff can prevent anyone from participating in the program for any reason.\ufeff\n\n\n\nMany have spoken out against arming educators for the inherent safety risks it poses, especially in armed-shooter situations. On Twitter, Charlotte Clymer compiled a thread of reactions from concerned gun owners and war veterans about the proposed law:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe thread included an excerpt from a New York Times article featuring former Marine sniper and author of the memoir Jarhead, Anthony Swofford.\n\nCalling any proposal to arm teachers \u201cabsurd,\u201d Swofford imagined a scenario in which a high school coach with a handgun would have to face down a student armed with an assault rifle:\n\nMore likely ... he would not have been able to draw his weapon (a side arm, presumably) quickly enough to stop the shooter, who with an an AR-15 would have had the coach outgunned. Even if the coach had been able to draw his weapon\u2014from where? his athletic shorts?\u2014any shots he managed to fire would have risked being errant, possibly injuring or killing additional students. As some studies have shown, even police officers have missed their targets more than 50 percent of the time. In firing a weapon, [the coach] would have only added to the carnage and confusion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut as Jamelle Bouie noted in a recent Slate article, school shootings are still, thankfully, a relatively rare phenomenon. What is not rare\u2014and what has been quantified in myriad ways throughout the years\u2014is racial bias in classrooms. And as Sen. Braynon implied, the Marshal Program, by introducing guns into environments where students of color are disciplined at disturbingly disproportionate rates, is much more likely to harm students than it is to save lives.\n\nAs Bouie wrote, black, Latinx and Native American students are most likely to face harsh in-school discipline, despite not being any more likely to misbehave than their white counterparts. Bouie includes a number of data points to back this up, including this striking example: a 2011 study that found that 32 percent of black students were suspended for a first-time offense of using a cellphone at school. Their white peers were suspended at a rate of 15 percent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAt all ages, black and Latino children are viewed as more dangerous and unruly, regardless of actual behavior,\u201d Bouie wrote\u2014and in reading this passage, it\u2019s difficult not to recall the image of a school police officer pulling a black girl from her desk and slamming her to the ground. From teachers to administrators to law enforcement officers, schools have not hesitated to dole out the most severe punishments to students of color.\n\nAnd now firearms may be an option.\n\nThis is perhaps the most disturbing fact: There is no age at which students of color are truly protected. Yale research suggests that racial bias exists among preschool teachers. In one study conducted by the university, preschool teachers were asked to watch video clips of children in classrooms and scan for \u201cchallenging behavior.\u201d The jig? None of the clips contained challenging behaviors. Nevertheless, researchers found that the teachers, scanning for signs of trouble, spent more time looking at black children than white children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe group they spent the most time watching? Black boys.\n\nIt isn\u2019t difficult to imagine what could happen in a high school classroom when an armed teacher, however \u201cwell-intentioned,\u201d anticipates challenging or dangerous behavior from a black student. For that matter, how do we expect our students to behave knowing that their teachers are armed? (And having worked in a school, I can promise you, students will find out which teachers are.)\n\nThe proposed bill in Florida also allows school district superintendents and county sheriffs to bar educators from participating in the program, thus introducing another entry point for an individual\u2019s implicit bias to determine which teachers and administrators get approved and which don\u2019t. It is hard to imagine a scenario in which black educators are approved to be armed at the same rate as their white peers.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut even if that were equal, there remains the final paradox: The educators rushing to get approved to bring firearms to school are the ones who have no business around your children. Ashley Nicole Black, a writer for Full Frontal with Samantha Bee, put it succinctly in one tweet:\n\n\n\n\u201cAll I can picture is every racist teacher who lashed out at me verbally or physically over the years and what would have happened if that person had a gun?\u201d Black wrote. \u201cYeah, there are more good, kind, teachers... but they\u2019re not gonna be the ones signing up for guns.\u201d", "keywords": ["gun", "students", "approved", "moving", "laws", "educators", "program", "black", "children", "legislature", "schools", "forward", "florida", "dangerous", "especially", "teachers", "armed", "school"], "polarity": 0.07754769921436586, "subjectivity": 0.5443712254823364},

I absolutely get that jobs are scarce and nice checks for those who truly \u201cstarted from the bottom, now we\u2019re here\u201d are extremely rare. But sometimes, wanting to stay out of the unemployment line can go too far. Just think about how many people you know who have checked out at their jobs because it\u2019s just easier to go along to get along.\n\n\n\nSo when I attended the Atlanta Hawks\u2019 diversity-inclusion symposium, MOSAIC (Model of Shaping Atlanta Through Inclusive Conversations), last week, I really expected Hill to continue walking the \u201cjust trying to keep my job\u201d tone of her statement. In my experience, many companies do these events just to look like they\u2019re doing something. Rarely are real issues even touched. The conversation usually reinforces what companies want to hear and not what employees of color\u2014black employees especially\u2014really experience, which is everything but diverse and inclusive. Plus, given MOSAIC\u2019s origins, I just didn\u2019t expect to hear anything out of the norm.\n\n\n\nMOSAIC, which you\u2019ve probably never heard of before now, is one of the initiatives the Atlanta Hawks created in response to their own racist mini scandal back in 2014, when racially disparaging comments from Danny Ferry\u2014the former Duke standout (enough said)\u2014and emails from then-Hawks co-owner Bruce Levenson surfaced. Ferry\u2019s comments centered on NBA forward Luol Deng\u2019s African heritage, while Levenson\u2019s emails basically argued that Hawks fans were too black and \u201cthat the black crowd scared away the whites and there are simply not enough affluent black fans to build a sign[i]ficant season ticket base.\u201d\n\n\n\nToday there\u2019s a new ownership group with former Duke and NBA player Grant Hill as a partner. Plus they hired Nzinga \u201cZing\u201d Shaw, as the NBA\u2019s first-ever chief diversity and inclusion officer. They\u2019ve also put on MOSAIC annually since 2016, and for this third year they tapped Hill to give the keynote address with \u201cDisruption\u201d as its theme.\n\nKicking off her address, Hill joked about spending time in Belize and zip-lining for the first time before easing into the White House calling her \u201cDonald Trump is a white supremacist\u201d tweet \u201ca fireable offense\u201d during a press briefing, backed by the man himself on Twitter, of course.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd in case there is anyone who thinks that no one is still riding for Trump, Hill made it clear that they are by sharing details of the snail mail of hate she received along with the social media abuse. \u201cI got called the n-word so much that I thought it was my middle name,\u201d she candidly revealed.\n\n\n\nAll of this happened as Hill was still warming her seat at ESPN\u2019s iconic SportsCenter, dubbed SC6 when she and her longtime co-host, Michael Smith, from the successful His & Hers show, took over in February 2017. ESPN didn\u2019t fire Hill or suspend her for those Trump tweets; rather, the sports network suspended her for another series of tweets in October 2017 that alluded to boycotting Dallas Cowboys advertisers in response to team owner Jerry Jones\u2019 promise to bench players who \u201cdisrespect the flag.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn Atlanta, Hill reiterated that the suspension was justified, noting that \u201cESPN is in the business of sports\u201d and \u201cnot in the business necessarily of being construed as a political organization and I put them firmly in those crosshairs.\u201d She also insisted that it was her decision to leave SC6 and join ESPN microsite The Undefeated to resume her writing career, with hosting TV specials and even creating her own video content as part of the deal.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI never intended to be a disruptor,\u201d she told the crowd. \u201cI never intended to be thrust into a role of activism,\u201d she added, noting that \u201cI didn\u2019t choose the moment; the moment chose me.\u201d\n\nMy worst fears about Hill giving up the fight like so many others whose outspokenness resulted in hard consequences seemed confirmed until she switched it up. As she took on the topics of disruption, diversity and inclusion, she spoke directly to those in hiring positions, who are still overwhelmingly white and male, informing them that people of color and women are experiencing this new old America in ways they can\u2019t even begin to imagine.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn whatever business that you\u2019re in, especially if you\u2019re a woman and you\u2019re a person of color, there\u2019s a level of vulnerability that you feel right now that may be hard for everybody to relate to. You feel a little scared and under attack right now under some of the current policies and tone that our country has taken,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGetting even more real, Hill confessed that, in the current Trump climate and after Charlottesville, Va., especially, there were days she didn\u2019t even want to come to work. \u201cFor the first time in my career,\u201d she admitted, \u201cit kind of put my dual role of person and journalist in conflict with one another.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI never intended to be a disruptor. I never intended to be thrust into a role of activism. I didn\u2019t choose the moment; the moment chose me.\u201d\n\nShe also let those in power know that the solution to diversity and inclusion issues didn\u2019t rest with those of us who didn\u2019t create the problem in the first place, and that hiring some of us was only the first step. \u201cGetting through the door is just one of the problems that needs to be addressed,\u201d she explained. \u201cWe all know there are definitely structures that need to change from a tangible standpoint. We need more women, we need more people of color, you need more LGBTQ people. We know that, but once they make it through the door, then what happens?\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSugarcoating was not on the menu as Hill shared that, in her 20-year career, she knew what it meant to just be a quota. \u201cI\u2019ve had the experience of being wanted for what I represent but not really wanted for what I represent,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what I mean about the difference about once you\u2019re actually through that door.\u201d She added:\n\n\n\nBecause you can talk a lot about wanting us at the table, but will you listen to us once we\u2019re actually in the room? Will you groom and mentor us the way you would somebody that looks like you? Will you invite us to come play golf? Will you invite us out to drinks so that we can network with key people? Will you recommend us for assignments that challenge and grow us? Will you promote us? Fast-track us? Treat us like franchise players and not just sixth men or sixth women that are on the bench? Will you give us credit when we deserve it, even it means that you get a little less credit?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrue diversity and inclusion gets uncomfortable, she said, and companies need to be clear about whether they really want to deal with that:\n\nWhen you start disrupting what your organization looks like, when it starts changing, and it\u2019s very emblematic of what\u2019s happening in this country right now, when the progressiveness gets a little too fast for people, a little too uncomfortable, when they start thinking that someone else\u2019s ascension or having different people in the room is going to mean less for them, then you get the blowback, then you get the brushback, and then you get the criticism, and then you get people who are angry and mad at you, and you have to make that decision in that moment: Am I here to support the people who are mad over really nothing, or am I here to support the people who have never gotten this opportunity or rarely get it?\n\nThe answer to the second half of that question, she said, has largely been a resounding \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou find in a lot of places\u2014they\u2019re more concerned about the people who are mad as opposed to the people they need to welcome,\u201d she explained. \u201cAnd so, if you\u2019re in charge and you\u2019re a thought leader, you have to really be honest with yourself about what you have the stomach to do, especially in tumultuous times.\u201d\n\n\n\nOne of my colleagues, who has seen Hill speak since this whole \u201cTrump is a white supremacist\u201d water-is-wet nonscandal, chastised me for even doubting the \u201cDetroit vs. Everybody\u201d native. So don\u2019t let the headlines sway you as they did me; please know that Hill is still spitting pure truth about what\u2019s really going down for us in this country.", "keywords": ["whats", "white", "spitting", "truth", "hill", "going", "youre", "america", "didnt", "jemele", "trump", "know", "little", "really", "moment", "need"], "polarity": 0.07532926669290302, "subjectivity": 0.5085638856093402},

Because it comes from Donald Trump and the NRA, it is a flawless plan that is both stable and genius.\n\n1. If we want to stop police from killing unarmed black people, we must arm more black people.\n\nIf arming teachers is a good idea, it only makes sense that arming black people would result in fewer deaths. Bystanders often capture police officers shooting black men and women. What if\u2014instead of cellphones\u2014 those people had guns? Using the NRA\u2019s logic, that would make cops and citizens safer, right?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, some people may counter this argument with pesky facts like the 2015 study of FBI and national crime by the Violence Policy Center (pdf) that concluded that people are more likely to cause an accidental death than prevent a crime when pulling a gun in self-defense. Others will try to unearth the Washington Post report that showed that for every justifiable homicide using a gun, there were 34 criminal homicides, 78 gun suicides and two accidental deaths.\n\nOr maybe they might point to the FBI report on active shooters between 2000 and 2013 (pdf) that shows that only 3 percent of active shooters were stopped by someone with a gun, while 13 percent were stopped by an unarmed person. Maybe they will foolishly refer to a Stanford University study that shows that states with concealed-weapons laws have more violent crime. But you know what they say:\n\nThe only person who can stop a bad guy with a gun is an untrained, untested, underpaid, overworked person who\u2019s just trying to teach a fifth-period social studies class ... with a gun.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Pay them off.\n\nAnother mistake made by the Movement for Black Lives is the whole protest thing. I don\u2019t know what these folks were thinking. What we need is cash.\n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cWhere are black people supposed to get enough money to pay off police in every state, county and municipality in America?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s the beauty of this whole plan! We get sponsors and corporations to do it for us. The majority of the NRA\u2019s money comes from corporations, gun manufacturers and sponsors, not the rank-and-file membership.\n\nMaybe we can get some sponsorships from people who benefit from police not killing black people, like SheaMoisture or the prison industry. Perhaps we could even convince Pepsi to repurpose that old Kendall Jenner commercial.\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019re not using it.\n\nSpeaking of Kendall Jenner ...\n\n3. Make white kids the face of Black Lives Matter.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s noticed that white people don\u2019t seem to respond to angry black people. I haven\u2019t done any research in this area, so it\u2019s just conjecture on my part.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConversely, everyone in America is lauding the effort of the white teen activists who are fighting for gun reform. Perhaps you\u2019ve noticed this before. The gun-reform question was raised after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting and after the Las Vegas massacre, and it\u2019s been in serious overdrive since the tragedy in Parkland, Fla.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to call anyone racist, because there\u2019s always the chance that no one\u2019s heard about the gun violence in Chicago or the thousands of black kids in cities across America who are killed by bullets fired from the same kinds of weapons.\n\nYou know what? I\u2019m not going to cast aspersions by making it seem like white people only care about white lives or white-on-white crime. That would be racist. Instead, I\u2019ll give white people the benefit of the doubt and say that they probably don\u2019t know about Chicago or black-on-black crime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI haven\u2019t done any research in this area, so it\u2019s just conjecture on my part.\n\n4. Make it a mental health issue.\n\nBlack people, I know this one will be hard to do, but instead of painting cops who disproportionately kill black people as racist or evil, we should address the mental-illness aspect of the equation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Betty Shelby shot Terence Crutcher in the back as he was walking away, she probably wasn\u2019t evil. She might have simply been a \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d woman who \u201cfell through the cracks.\u201d\n\nPerhaps Jeronimo Yanez, who shot Philando Castile, was a \u201cbroken child,\u201d as accused Parkland shooter Nikolas Cruz has been described. How do you know Darren Wilson wasn\u2019t \u201cremorseful\u201d after killing Mike Brown, as Cruz apparently is?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Trump and the NRA says, this is a mental health issue, not a gun issue. Of course, it\u2019s hard for mentally ill people to kill people without guns, but let\u2019s not put too fine a point on this. If only there were a name to describe the mental illness that causes cops to stop, search, ticket and kill black people disproportionately. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s one; I just can\u2019t think of it right now.\n\n5. Invoke the Constitution and bring up the will of the Founding Fathers.\n\nThis is the longest shot. I\u2019m not a legal scholar, but I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s nothing in the Constitution that guarantees black people equal protection under the law. If there were, someone would surely have brought that up by now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NRA\u2019s entire argument is based on the fact that the right to bear arms is a fundamental right, so the government shouldn\u2019t be able to regulate arms, regardless of how many people are killed by gunfire.\n\nOn the other hand, Black Lives Matter is considered a terrorist organization by some people and is closely watched by federal, state and local law enforcement agencies, despite the fact that the organization has been charged with zero deaths.\n\nAgain, my lack of legal training hampers me from knowing this, but if there were a constitutional amendment that came before the Second Amendment and that guaranteed people the right to peaceably assemble, protest and say whatever they wanted, that would be so dope!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI wish the Founding Fathers had written something about all men being created equal. It would make a great argument if someone found an obscure document we could point to that said that all Americans have the right to life. If it said something about liberty and the pursuit of happiness, that would be even better ...\n\nBut for now, I\u2019d settle for life.\n\nBy enacting these steps, white people won\u2019t have to suffer the insufferable torture of having to dry their eyes when NFL players demean the freedom and liberty of America by silently kneeling. No longer will they be forced to close their beautiful eyes to avoid seeing another bullet-riddled black corpse. This plan will save their voices from having to reflexively scream, \u201cAll lives matter,\u201d when confronted with the prospect that a black life has actual value.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m doing this for you, white people.\n\nYou\u2019re welcome.", "keywords": ["gun", "stuff", "white", "right", "im", "plan", "racist", "matter", "black", "lives", "trump", "know", "crime", "think", "solved", "donald", "nra"], "polarity": 0.025407848324514988, "subjectivity": 0.4789535567313344},

On Saturday, both Delta Air Lines and its competitor United joined that growing list by announcing that they were ceasing discounts for NRA members.\n\nAccording to Raw Story, Delta also asked the NRA to remove its airline information from its site.\n\nBut Georgia Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle and his fellow NRA-thirsty cronies lawmakers will not stand for such injustice. On Monday, Cagle, who just so happens to be plotting a run for the state\u2019s governorship, announced that he and his fellow conservatives were fighting back.\n\n\u201cI will kill any tax legislation that benefits Delta unless the company changes its position and fully reinstates its relationship with the NRA,\u201d Cagle tweeted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe public threat was directed toward Delta in particular because the airline is based in Atlanta.

And, moreover, is such a move legal?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCagle\u2019s warning certainly appeases the NRA and its supporters, many of whom called for a Delta boycott following the airline\u2019s announcement, as Raw Story notes.

I absolutely get that jobs are scarce and nice checks for those who truly \u201cstarted from the bottom, now we\u2019re here\u201d are extremely rare. But sometimes, wanting to stay out of the unemployment line can go too far. Just think about how many people you know who have checked out at their jobs because it\u2019s just easier to go along to get along.\n\n\n\nSo when I attended the Atlanta Hawks\u2019 diversity-inclusion symposium, MOSAIC (Model of Shaping Atlanta Through Inclusive Conversations), last week, I really expected Hill to continue walking the \u201cjust trying to keep my job\u201d tone of her statement. In my experience, many companies do these events just to look like they\u2019re doing something. Rarely are real issues even touched. The conversation usually reinforces what companies want to hear and not what employees of color\u2014black employees especially\u2014really experience, which is everything but diverse and inclusive. Plus, given MOSAIC\u2019s origins, I just didn\u2019t expect to hear anything out of the norm.\n\n\n\nMOSAIC, which you\u2019ve probably never heard of before now, is one of the initiatives the Atlanta Hawks created in response to their own racist mini scandal back in 2014, when racially disparaging comments from Danny Ferry\u2014the former Duke standout (enough said)\u2014and emails from then-Hawks co-owner Bruce Levenson surfaced. Ferry\u2019s comments centered on NBA forward Luol Deng\u2019s African heritage, while Levenson\u2019s emails basically argued that Hawks fans were too black and \u201cthat the black crowd scared away the whites and there are simply not enough affluent black fans to build a sign[i]ficant season ticket base.\u201d\n\n\n\nToday there\u2019s a new ownership group with former Duke and NBA player Grant Hill as a partner. Plus they hired Nzinga \u201cZing\u201d Shaw, as the NBA\u2019s first-ever chief diversity and inclusion officer. They\u2019ve also put on MOSAIC annually since 2016, and for this third year they tapped Hill to give the keynote address with \u201cDisruption\u201d as its theme.\n\nKicking off her address, Hill joked about spending time in Belize and zip-lining for the first time before easing into the White House calling her \u201cDonald Trump is a white supremacist\u201d tweet \u201ca fireable offense\u201d during a press briefing, backed by the man himself on Twitter, of course.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd in case there is anyone who thinks that no one is still riding for Trump, Hill made it clear that they are by sharing details of the snail mail of hate she received along with the social media abuse. \u201cI got called the n-word so much that I thought it was my middle name,\u201d she candidly revealed.\n\n\n\nAll of this happened as Hill was still warming her seat at ESPN\u2019s iconic SportsCenter, dubbed SC6 when she and her longtime co-host, Michael Smith, from the successful His & Hers show, took over in February 2017. ESPN didn\u2019t fire Hill or suspend her for those Trump tweets; rather, the sports network suspended her for another series of tweets in October 2017 that alluded to boycotting Dallas Cowboys advertisers in response to team owner Jerry Jones\u2019 promise to bench players who \u201cdisrespect the flag.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn Atlanta, Hill reiterated that the suspension was justified, noting that \u201cESPN is in the business of sports\u201d and \u201cnot in the business necessarily of being construed as a political organization and I put them firmly in those crosshairs.\u201d She also insisted that it was her decision to leave SC6 and join ESPN microsite The Undefeated to resume her writing career, with hosting TV specials and even creating her own video content as part of the deal.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI never intended to be a disruptor,\u201d she told the crowd. \u201cI never intended to be thrust into a role of activism,\u201d she added, noting that \u201cI didn\u2019t choose the moment; the moment chose me.\u201d\n\nMy worst fears about Hill giving up the fight like so many others whose outspokenness resulted in hard consequences seemed confirmed until she switched it up. As she took on the topics of disruption, diversity and inclusion, she spoke directly to those in hiring positions, who are still overwhelmingly white and male, informing them that people of color and women are experiencing this new old America in ways they can\u2019t even begin to imagine.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn whatever business that you\u2019re in, especially if you\u2019re a woman and you\u2019re a person of color, there\u2019s a level of vulnerability that you feel right now that may be hard for everybody to relate to. You feel a little scared and under attack right now under some of the current policies and tone that our country has taken,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGetting even more real, Hill confessed that, in the current Trump climate and after Charlottesville, Va., especially, there were days she didn\u2019t even want to come to work. \u201cFor the first time in my career,\u201d she admitted, \u201cit kind of put my dual role of person and journalist in conflict with one another.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI never intended to be a disruptor. I never intended to be thrust into a role of activism. I didn\u2019t choose the moment; the moment chose me.\u201d\n\nShe also let those in power know that the solution to diversity and inclusion issues didn\u2019t rest with those of us who didn\u2019t create the problem in the first place, and that hiring some of us was only the first step. \u201cGetting through the door is just one of the problems that needs to be addressed,\u201d she explained. \u201cWe all know there are definitely structures that need to change from a tangible standpoint. We need more women, we need more people of color, you need more LGBTQ people. We know that, but once they make it through the door, then what happens?\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSugarcoating was not on the menu as Hill shared that, in her 20-year career, she knew what it meant to just be a quota. \u201cI\u2019ve had the experience of being wanted for what I represent but not really wanted for what I represent,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what I mean about the difference about once you\u2019re actually through that door.\u201d She added:\n\n\n\nBecause you can talk a lot about wanting us at the table, but will you listen to us once we\u2019re actually in the room? Will you groom and mentor us the way you would somebody that looks like you? Will you invite us to come play golf? Will you invite us out to drinks so that we can network with key people? Will you recommend us for assignments that challenge and grow us? Will you promote us? Fast-track us? Treat us like franchise players and not just sixth men or sixth women that are on the bench? Will you give us credit when we deserve it, even it means that you get a little less credit?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrue diversity and inclusion gets uncomfortable, she said, and companies need to be clear about whether they really want to deal with that:\n\nWhen you start disrupting what your organization looks like, when it starts changing, and it\u2019s very emblematic of what\u2019s happening in this country right now, when the progressiveness gets a little too fast for people, a little too uncomfortable, when they start thinking that someone else\u2019s ascension or having different people in the room is going to mean less for them, then you get the blowback, then you get the brushback, and then you get the criticism, and then you get people who are angry and mad at you, and you have to make that decision in that moment: Am I here to support the people who are mad over really nothing, or am I here to support the people who have never gotten this opportunity or rarely get it?\n\nThe answer to the second half of that question, she said, has largely been a resounding \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou find in a lot of places\u2014they\u2019re more concerned about the people who are mad as opposed to the people they need to welcome,\u201d she explained. \u201cAnd so, if you\u2019re in charge and you\u2019re a thought leader, you have to really be honest with yourself about what you have the stomach to do, especially in tumultuous times.\u201d\n\n\n\nOne of my colleagues, who has seen Hill speak since this whole \u201cTrump is a white supremacist\u201d water-is-wet nonscandal, chastised me for even doubting the \u201cDetroit vs. Everybody\u201d native. So don\u2019t let the headlines sway you as they did me; please know that Hill is still spitting pure truth about what\u2019s really going down for us in this country.", "keywords": ["whats", "white", "spitting", "truth", "hill", "going", "youre", "america", "didnt", "jemele", "trump", "know", "little", "really", "moment", "need"], "polarity": 0.07532926669290302, "subjectivity": 0.5085638856093402},

The following is a quote from an email sent by Hawks minority owner Michael Gearon, who was so offended by Ferry's comments that he wanted him fired:\n\n\n\nWith respect to one potential free agent, a highly-regarded African-American player and humanitarian, Ferry talked about the player's good points, and then went on to describe his negatives, stating that \"he has a little African in him. Not in a bad way, but he's like a guy who would have a nice store out front but sell you counterfeit stuff out of the back.\" Ferry completed the racial slur by describing the player (and impliedly, all persons of African decent) as a two-faced liar and cheat.\n\nApparently, the player discussed was Luol Deng, known through NBA circles as being a great teammate and humanitarian who, according to Ferry, probably also sells Louis purses and belts out of his trunk.\n\nAnyway, intrigued by Ferry's comments, our crack research team discovered a few more of Danny Ferry's scouting reports on NBA players, and will share a few of them today.\n\nCarmelo Anthony\n\n\n\nGreat scorer. A little selfish. Nice looking wife, who may or may not taste like cereal. Is from Baltimore, so has some of The Wire in him. Will definitely rob and murder you if he had to. But, not in a bad way, though. He has a good heart. Basically, he's just like Bodie\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlake Griffin\n\n\n\nAwesome athlete. Improving player. Marketable, because of the Black and White thing. We can market him to fans unaware one drop of Black blood makes you Black. Again, has some Black in him. But not the bad Black, like Idi Amin. The good Black, like Jason Derulo. Maybe you wouldn't let your daughter date him. But, you wouldn't be mad if he was in your daughter's study group\n\nLebron James\n\n\n\nGreat player. One of the all-time best. Versatile. Marketable. Is married now, so that's good. Used to have the bad Akron in him. Which is why he wasn't married and started losing his hair. But now has the good Akron in him. Which is why he went back to Cleveland.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSerge Ibaka\n\n\n\nGreat defender. Getting better on offense. But, is African. And apparently has a large penis \u2014 at least according to my source at Lipstick Alley \u2014 so we can't risk signing him. Can't have more than one large penised African on the team. Would make for awkward Bobblehead nights.\n\nKevin Durant\n\n\n\nBest scorer in the game. Hard worker. Humble. Is a mama's boy, though. But is the good kind of mama's boy, though. Not the bad kind, like Tyrese in that movie and what's-his-name from Game of Thrones. But the good kind, who loves and depends on his mama. Can tell he's the good kind by his reluctant to brush his hair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChris Paul\n\n\n\nBest floor general. Leader. Marketable. Great teammate. Can't trust him, though. He is Black, so it's possible he invented Cliff Paul just to evade the police. My daughter also thinks he's cute, which\u2026just no.\n\nKobe Bryant\n\n\n\nAll-time great scorer and competitor. Asshole, but not the bad type of asshole. Has some issues with women, apparently. But not the bad kind. More the good, charming kind. Like Charles Manson. You need some Charles Mansons on your team to beat the Spurs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDwight Howard\n\n\n\nFucking shithead.\n\nRussell Westbrook\n\n\n\nGreat, great athlete and competitor. Might be the most underrated player in the league. Is apparently a Black hipster. But not the bad, poser kind. More authentic. Like someone from Brooklyn instead of someone from D.C. Still wouldn't take him, though. Prefer Black players to be more Black, without being too Black.

I was wrong. In the 150 miles between Pittsburgh and Cumberland, Md., we saw four.\n\nThe dearth of black people on the GAP trail should be no surprise to anyone who\u2019s driven through Pennsylvania. A popular joke about the state is that it\u2019s Pittsburgh on one side, Philadelphia on the other and Alabama in between. The \u201cjoke,\u201d of course, is that once you leave those metropolitan areas, you\u2019re surrounded by small towns and rural farmland. And \u201csurrounded by small towns and rural farmland\u201d is a euphemistic way of saying \u201csurrounded by whiteness.\u201d\n\nThing is, that dynamic isn\u2019t exactly unique to Pennsylvania. Regardless of where you are in the country, once you get 10-15 miles outside a city\u2019s greater metropolitan area, you\u2019re probably going to splash into a sea of white people. And that sea probably won\u2019t end until you\u2019re near another city. It\u2019s so stark that if you had no concept of America and you asked an American where the black people lived, they could just draw a small circle around the 30 largest cities, say \u201cthere\u201d and be mostly accurate. And then, if you asked where the white people lived, they could say, \u201cThere, too. And everywhere else.\u201d\n\nIn America, white people are everywhere, and this ubiquity connects to perhaps our greatest irony: We (black people) are vastly outnumbered by them. They also own more land, earn and possess more money, and have all the guns. Most of the people making laws are white, as are most of the people enforcing them. There are entire states you can drive through without seeing one of us, entire lives that can be led without ever having any meaningful interaction with us. We are surrounded, outnumbered, out-resourced and outgunned. Our entire existence here is a continual assault on our bodies.\n\nBut we are the ones perceived to be the threats. We are the ones they\u2019re scared of. We are the ones who tell our children how to dress and how to wear their hair so they\u2019re not thought of as threats to them. We are the ones who consciously and subconsciously modify our voices and our behavior when forced to interact with them. We\u2019re the ones whom trained officers with weapons and badges and handcuffs and legal justifications are so damn scared of that we\u2019ve created entire curricula based on that fear, teaching ourselves what to do to seem less frightening to them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis fear is why they\u2019re so obsessed with arming themselves with multiple human killing machines. It\u2019s why they fight against even the notion of incremental disarmament so vehemently. They are scared shitless of us. Of anyone who is not them. And this fear is why our shitty gun laws exist, and it\u2019s why they will continue to.\n\nPerhaps this fear is guilt-based, and they\u2019re scared the same way you were as a kid when you stole some cash from your teacher\u2019s purse. And you kept waiting for repercussions, but they just never came. But that fear\u2014that feeling that you\u2019d have to answer for your wrongs eventually\u2014never quite left. Or maybe this fear is karmic. A belief that once we \u201cget on top,\u201d we\u2019ll treat them the way they\u2019ve treated us. And that fear drives them to do whatever they can to maintain their position.\n\nEither way, I doubt we\u2019ll see any movement on guns until they acknowledge this pervasive and delusional and self-destructive collective fear and go to therapy.

Roberts (AP Images)\n\nOn Friday, the American criminal-justice system actually got something right; as it turns out, DeAndre Harris, the black man who was brutally beaten during the Charlottesville, Va., Unite the Right white supremacist rally, was found not guilty of assaulting a white nationalist.\n\nLast year, Harris, who was counterprotesting the infamous rally, was cornered and attacked by white supremacists in a parking garage. He sustained multiple injuries, including a broken wrist and staples in his head. Yet for some reason, Harris was charged with felony counts as well as misdemeanor assault following his own beating. The felony charges were ultimately dropped, but he was still forced to stand trial for the misdemeanor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, on the same day Harris went to trial, he was immediately acquitted. Charlottesville General District Court Judge Robert Downer Jr. found Harris, 20, not guilty. Had Harris been convicted, he would have faced up to 12 months in jail along with a $2,500 fine for allegedly striking Harold Crews, a North Carolina attorney and state chairman of the League of the South, the Washington Post reports.\n\nHowever, Downer declared that Harris did not intend to strike Crews and only swung a flashlight at him because he believed that Crews was hitting his friends with a flagpole.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(Come THROUGH, Downer!)\n\nRacists White nationalists and their minions had attempted to use footage of what happened prior to Harris\u2019 beating as an attempt to discredit the 20-year-old. YouTube video, the Post notes, showed the moments before Harris was attacked.\n\nIn one clip, Crews is seen holding a large flagpole in front of a black protester, who is pulling on the other end. As the two grapple over the pole, Harris swings his flashlight, seemingly hitting Crews on his head or shoulder.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoments later, several white supremacists cornered Harris in the garage and brutally took him to the ground, attacking him.\n\nAs stated, Harris suffered severe injuries, only to be treated as a criminal afterward. His friends and family started a GoFundMe to help pay for his medical expenses, a campaign that raised a whopping $166,045.\n\nHopefully, now that his legal trial has been tossed out once and for all, he can truly start to move on from the horrifying ordeal ... as much as he can, at least, as the people who attacked him await their own trials.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think for them to be allowed to come here and protest is really crazy. How do you expect the KKK to come to your city to protest, and them not be violent? I understand everyone is entitled to their freedom of speech, but the government and the mayor made a bad business move. It\u2019s only caused havoc in your own city.

Serena won again, the NFL proved (again) that we're all hypocrites, and Steph Curry decided to go all Steph Curry against Mexico. He must be racist.\n\nFor me, though, the most interesting sports-related item was the news that Atlanta Hawks owner Bruce Levenson would be selling his share of the team after a racially insensitive email he sent in 2012 was revealed.\n\nNow, there are several theories about the timing of the decision. Some think Levenson \u2014 encouraged by the outrageous figures the Clippers and the Bucks recently sold for \u2014 is just using this as a convenient opportunity to sell the team and make a profit. Some think there are other, more damaging emails that, by owning up to this one, Levenson is trying to keep quiet. And some think it happened because Jay Z is cheating on Beyonce with Elle Varner.\n\nEither way, I'm not as interested in the timing of the email as I am with the actual content of it. Specifically, exactly how racist is it? Having read the entire letter a few times, here's a paragraph-by-paragraph breakdown of Levenson's racism (or lack thereof).\n\n\n\nFrom: Bruce Levenson To: Ferry, Danny CC: Foreman, Todd (ucg.com); Peskowitz, Ed (ucg.com) Sent: 8/25/2012 11:47:02 PM Subject: Re: Business/Game ops 1. from day one i have been impressed with the friendliness and professionalism of the arena staff \u2014 food vendors, ushers, ticket takers, etc. in our early years when i would bring folks from dc they were blown away by the contrast between abe pollin's arena and philips. some of this is attributable to southern hospital and manners but bob and his staff do a good job of training. To this day, I can not get the ushers to call me Bruce yet they insist on me calling them by their first names. 2. the non-premium area food is better than most arenas, though that is not saying much. i think there is room for improvement and creativity. Levy is our food vendor so we don't have much control but they have been good partners. i have wished we had some inconic offereing like boog's barbeque at the baseball stadium in balt. 3. our new restaurant, red, just opened so too early for me to give you my thoughts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNothing really racist yet, although words like \"professionalism\" and \"southern\" and \"baseball\" and \"dc\" can be dog whistles. Verdict: 5% racist.\n\n\n\n4. Regarding game ops, i need to start with some background. for the first couple of years we owned the team, i didn't much focus on game ops. then one day a light bulb went off. when digging into why our season ticket base is so small, i was told it is because we can't get 35-55 white males and corporations to buy season tixs and they are the primary demo for season tickets around the league. when i pushed further, folks generally shrugged their shoulders. then i start looking around our arena during games and notice the following: \u2014 it's 70 pct black \u2014 the cheerleaders are black \u2014 the music is hip hop \u2014 at the bars it's 90 pct black \u2014 there are few fathers and sons at the games \u2014 we are doing after game concerts to attract more fans and the concerts are either hip hop or gospel. Then i start looking around at other arenas. It is completely different. Even DC with its affluent black community never has more than 15 pct black audience.\n\nBefore we bought the hawks and for those couple years immediately after in an effort to make the arena look full (at the nba's urging) thousands and thousands of tickets were being giving away, predominantly in the black community, adding to the overwhelming black audience. My theory is that the black crowd scared away the whites and there are simply not enough affluent black fans to build a signficant season ticket base. Please dont get me wrong. There was nothing threatening going on in the arean back then. i never felt uncomfortable, but i think southern whites simply were not comfortable being in an arena or at a bar where they were in the minority. On fan sites i would read comments about how dangerous it is around philips yet in our 9 years, i don't know of a mugging or even a pick pocket incident. This was just racist garbage. When I hear some people saying the arena is in the wrong place I think it is code for there are too many blacks at the games.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe observations Levenson's making aren't wrong. When you make something too Black, it has a tendency to turn off many people. It happens with certain brands. It's happening to certain cities and certain neighborhoods. And it even happened to the NBA. Even if something is safe and quality, having too much Blackness associated with it gives many the impression it's unsafe and lacking quality. If you want something to be considered to be good, to be wholesome, to be worth talking about, it needs to be \"White\" or racially neutral \u2014 which is another one of saying \"White.\"\n\nAlso, saying \"tendency to turn off many people\" instead of \"tendency to turn off White people\" was intentional. Because White people are not the only ones who do this. That type of racialized thinking is so pervasive that it affects us too, where some of us instinctively dismiss or downgrade something if we think it's too Black. Basically, fuck slavery. Verdict: 35% racist.\n\n\n\nI have been open with our executive team about these concerns. I have told them I want some white cheerleaders and while i don't care what the color of the artist is, i want the music to be music familiar to a 40 year old white guy if that's our season tixs demo. i have also balked when every fan picked out of crowd to shoot shots in some time out contest is black. I have even bitched that the kiss cam is too black. Gradually things have changed. My unscientific guess is that our crowd is 40 pct black now, still four to five times all other teams. And my further guess is that 40 pct still feels like 70 pet to some whites at our games. Our bars are still overwhelmingly black. This is obviously a sensitive topic, but sadly i think it is far and way the number one reason our season ticket base is so low.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat Levenson is doing here is a form of respectability politics (RP) that has never really been proven to work. Again, his observations aren't wrong. But his conclusion \u2014 \"\u2026I think it is far and away the number one reason our season ticket base is so low\" \u2014 is classic RP, thinking an aesthetic change (less Blacks at games) will have an effect on a structural issue (season ticket base), and blaming that structural issue on an aesthetic concern.\n\nAs anyone familiar with both sports culture and Atlanta sports culture will tell you, the city of Atlanta is notoriously poor at supporting professional sports teams. Even when the Atlanta Braves were dominating the national league, they never were able to draw great crowds.\n\nPart of this is due to the nature of the city. Atlanta, from what I understand, is filled with transplants. This is especially true when controlling for the types of people with disposable income. And, when you have a city full of transplants, you're not going to have as many ties to the local sports teams.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore importantly, the Atlanta Hawks are entering their third consecutive decade of lukewarm basketball. They are, effectively. the Memphis Bleek of the NBA. No one checked for Bleek verses, but no one hated them either. They just existed. And that's what the Hawks have done over the past 30 years. Just existed. They haven't had a star on their team since Dominique Wilkins. Even then, as good as Nique was, you knew the Hawks weren't beating the Bulls, Celtics, or Pistons in a series.\n\nAnd, when you're in Atlanta \u2014 a city soooo much shit to do \u2014 and you're not even from Atlanta, what incentive do you have to spend good money to watch Memphis Bleek perform 41 shows a year? Verdict: 52% racist.\n\n\n\nAnd many of our black fans don't have the spendable income which explains why our f&b and merchandise sales are so low. At all white thrasher games sales were nearly triple what they are at hawks games (the extra intermission explains some of that but not all).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe has a valid concern here. I have no facts or figures to back this up, but I do think we (Black people) are less likely to buy team-related apparel than White people are. Even when I go to college and pro games, the other Black people I tend to see are dressed regularly while the White fans seem to be more likely to wear a jersey or some other type of team/school gear. I wouldn't put this on spendable income, though. Instead, I think it's just a cultural thing. When White fans buy jerseys, it tends to be for fandom. When Black fans do, it tends to be for fashion. Verdict: 32% racist\n\n\n\nRegardless of what time a game starts, we have the latest arriving crowd in the league. It often looks and sounds empty when the team takes the floor.\n\nNo caveats here. This is very true. We (Black people) are late as fuck. Verdict: 2% racist\n\n\n\nIn the past two years, we have created a section of rowdy college students that has been a big plus. And we do a lot of very clever stuff during time outs to entertain the crowd. Our kiss cam is better done than any in the league. We have all the same halftime acts that other arenas have but i question whether they make sense. people are on their cell phones during half time. i wonder if flashing on the scoreboard \"$2 off on hot dogs during halftime tonight\" just as the half ends would be a better use of our halftime dollars and make the fans happier. We do all the usual giveways and the fans are usually their loudest when our spirit crew takes the floor to give away t-shirts. It pisses me off that they will yell louder for a t-shirt then for our players. Our player intro is flat. We manufacture a lot of noise but because of the late arriving crowd and the fact that a lot of blacks dont seem to go as crazy cheering (another one of my theories) as whites, it is not great. Even when we have just returned from winnng four straight on the road, i am one of the few people in the arena standing and cheering when our team takes the floor. Bob has kicked around ideas like having the starters coming down aisles rather than off the bench during intros. Sounds cool but may highlight all the empty seats at the start of games. Not enough of our fans wear hawks jerseys to games. i have just begun to push for ideas like discount food lines for folks wearing jerseys, special entrances, etc. I think we need a committed and perhaps incentivized fan club. We need to realize atl is simply different than every other city. Just adopting nba best practices is not enough. we have to create our own. I am rambling and could probably go on forever. If you have any specific areas you would like my thoughts on, let me know. Best, Bruce ps \u2014 I have cc'd todd and ed so they can chime in with additional or different thoughts. Sent from my iPad\n\nAside from his theory on the difference between Blacks and Whites cheering \u2014 which I'll address in a sec \u2014 nothing else Levenson said is racially tinged. What I read here is a businessman concerned with his product's profitability; a man who might not be a racist, but lazily drew racist conclusions to an issue that goes much deeper than any cosmetic racial concerns. Basically, it's the Black people's fault \u2014 not the city's dynamic or his 40 degree day basketball team (that he helped construct, mind you) \u2014 that he's not making as much money as he could.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLastly, I don't think he's wrong about the cheering differences between Black and White fans. It's something I've noticed as well. When you think \"fanatic\", regardless of the sport, you think of a White fan donned in his team's gear, screaming for his team's players while booing and cussing at the opponents. My theory about why this is, though, probably differs a bit from Levenson's. In regards to the three major sports \u2014 football and basketball especially \u2014 if a Black person goes to a game, he's probably going to see people who look like him \u2014 or look like they can be friends with or related to them \u2014 on the field/court. It's not just Lebron James out there, it's a dude that looks like my tall homie from high school. (Or, in some cases, the dude who was my tall homie in high school.) And when you have this type of personal/racial connection, you're going to be less likely to see them as just some anonymous athlete with a number on his back who you can cheer and boo with no prejudice.\n\nThese, of course, are just my thoughts.

I absolutely get that jobs are scarce and nice checks for those who truly \u201cstarted from the bottom, now we\u2019re here\u201d are extremely rare. But sometimes, wanting to stay out of the unemployment line can go too far. Just think about how many people you know who have checked out at their jobs because it\u2019s just easier to go along to get along.\n\n\n\nSo when I attended the Atlanta Hawks\u2019 diversity-inclusion symposium, MOSAIC (Model of Shaping Atlanta Through Inclusive Conversations), last week, I really expected Hill to continue walking the \u201cjust trying to keep my job\u201d tone of her statement. In my experience, many companies do these events just to look like they\u2019re doing something. Rarely are real issues even touched. The conversation usually reinforces what companies want to hear and not what employees of color\u2014black employees especially\u2014really experience, which is everything but diverse and inclusive. Plus, given MOSAIC\u2019s origins, I just didn\u2019t expect to hear anything out of the norm.\n\n\n\nMOSAIC, which you\u2019ve probably never heard of before now, is one of the initiatives the Atlanta Hawks created in response to their own racist mini scandal back in 2014, when racially disparaging comments from Danny Ferry\u2014the former Duke standout (enough said)\u2014and emails from then-Hawks co-owner Bruce Levenson surfaced. Ferry\u2019s comments centered on NBA forward Luol Deng\u2019s African heritage, while Levenson\u2019s emails basically argued that Hawks fans were too black and \u201cthat the black crowd scared away the whites and there are simply not enough affluent black fans to build a sign[i]ficant season ticket base.\u201d\n\n\n\nToday there\u2019s a new ownership group with former Duke and NBA player Grant Hill as a partner. Plus they hired Nzinga \u201cZing\u201d Shaw, as the NBA\u2019s first-ever chief diversity and inclusion officer. They\u2019ve also put on MOSAIC annually since 2016, and for this third year they tapped Hill to give the keynote address with \u201cDisruption\u201d as its theme.\n\nKicking off her address, Hill joked about spending time in Belize and zip-lining for the first time before easing into the White House calling her \u201cDonald Trump is a white supremacist\u201d tweet \u201ca fireable offense\u201d during a press briefing, backed by the man himself on Twitter, of course.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd in case there is anyone who thinks that no one is still riding for Trump, Hill made it clear that they are by sharing details of the snail mail of hate she received along with the social media abuse. \u201cI got called the n-word so much that I thought it was my middle name,\u201d she candidly revealed.\n\n\n\nAll of this happened as Hill was still warming her seat at ESPN\u2019s iconic SportsCenter, dubbed SC6 when she and her longtime co-host, Michael Smith, from the successful His & Hers show, took over in February 2017. ESPN didn\u2019t fire Hill or suspend her for those Trump tweets; rather, the sports network suspended her for another series of tweets in October 2017 that alluded to boycotting Dallas Cowboys advertisers in response to team owner Jerry Jones\u2019 promise to bench players who \u201cdisrespect the flag.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn Atlanta, Hill reiterated that the suspension was justified, noting that \u201cESPN is in the business of sports\u201d and \u201cnot in the business necessarily of being construed as a political organization and I put them firmly in those crosshairs.\u201d She also insisted that it was her decision to leave SC6 and join ESPN microsite The Undefeated to resume her writing career, with hosting TV specials and even creating her own video content as part of the deal.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI never intended to be a disruptor,\u201d she told the crowd. \u201cI never intended to be thrust into a role of activism,\u201d she added, noting that \u201cI didn\u2019t choose the moment; the moment chose me.\u201d\n\nMy worst fears about Hill giving up the fight like so many others whose outspokenness resulted in hard consequences seemed confirmed until she switched it up. As she took on the topics of disruption, diversity and inclusion, she spoke directly to those in hiring positions, who are still overwhelmingly white and male, informing them that people of color and women are experiencing this new old America in ways they can\u2019t even begin to imagine.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn whatever business that you\u2019re in, especially if you\u2019re a woman and you\u2019re a person of color, there\u2019s a level of vulnerability that you feel right now that may be hard for everybody to relate to. You feel a little scared and under attack right now under some of the current policies and tone that our country has taken,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGetting even more real, Hill confessed that, in the current Trump climate and after Charlottesville, Va., especially, there were days she didn\u2019t even want to come to work. \u201cFor the first time in my career,\u201d she admitted, \u201cit kind of put my dual role of person and journalist in conflict with one another.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI never intended to be a disruptor. I never intended to be thrust into a role of activism. I didn\u2019t choose the moment; the moment chose me.\u201d\n\nShe also let those in power know that the solution to diversity and inclusion issues didn\u2019t rest with those of us who didn\u2019t create the problem in the first place, and that hiring some of us was only the first step. \u201cGetting through the door is just one of the problems that needs to be addressed,\u201d she explained. \u201cWe all know there are definitely structures that need to change from a tangible standpoint. We need more women, we need more people of color, you need more LGBTQ people. We know that, but once they make it through the door, then what happens?\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSugarcoating was not on the menu as Hill shared that, in her 20-year career, she knew what it meant to just be a quota. \u201cI\u2019ve had the experience of being wanted for what I represent but not really wanted for what I represent,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what I mean about the difference about once you\u2019re actually through that door.\u201d She added:\n\n\n\nBecause you can talk a lot about wanting us at the table, but will you listen to us once we\u2019re actually in the room? Will you groom and mentor us the way you would somebody that looks like you? Will you invite us to come play golf? Will you invite us out to drinks so that we can network with key people? Will you recommend us for assignments that challenge and grow us? Will you promote us? Fast-track us? Treat us like franchise players and not just sixth men or sixth women that are on the bench? Will you give us credit when we deserve it, even it means that you get a little less credit?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrue diversity and inclusion gets uncomfortable, she said, and companies need to be clear about whether they really want to deal with that:\n\nWhen you start disrupting what your organization looks like, when it starts changing, and it\u2019s very emblematic of what\u2019s happening in this country right now, when the progressiveness gets a little too fast for people, a little too uncomfortable, when they start thinking that someone else\u2019s ascension or having different people in the room is going to mean less for them, then you get the blowback, then you get the brushback, and then you get the criticism, and then you get people who are angry and mad at you, and you have to make that decision in that moment: Am I here to support the people who are mad over really nothing, or am I here to support the people who have never gotten this opportunity or rarely get it?\n\nThe answer to the second half of that question, she said, has largely been a resounding \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou find in a lot of places\u2014they\u2019re more concerned about the people who are mad as opposed to the people they need to welcome,\u201d she explained. \u201cAnd so, if you\u2019re in charge and you\u2019re a thought leader, you have to really be honest with yourself about what you have the stomach to do, especially in tumultuous times.\u201d\n\n\n\nOne of my colleagues, who has seen Hill speak since this whole \u201cTrump is a white supremacist\u201d water-is-wet nonscandal, chastised me for even doubting the \u201cDetroit vs. Everybody\u201d native. So don\u2019t let the headlines sway you as they did me; please know that Hill is still spitting pure truth about what\u2019s really going down for us in this country.", "keywords": ["whats", "white", "spitting", "truth", "hill", "going", "youre", "america", "didnt", "jemele", "trump", "know", "little", "really", "moment", "need"], "polarity": 0.07532926669290302, "subjectivity": 0.5085638856093402},

Even though he has no legislative, political or policy victories during his presidency, Trump has proved himself a master of the one thing he does better than anyone else:\n\nRacism.\n\nSometimes the terms \u201cwhite supremacy\u201d and \u201csystematic oppression\u201d can seem hyperbolic, while a word like \u201cprejudice\u201d is wholly inadequate. Yet if one truly wants to understand structural racism, the current controversy in the NFL is a microcosm of how white supremacy manifests itself into policy and action.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the demonstrations during the national anthem are the biggest story in football this year, let\u2019s be clear: The number of NFL players actually participating in the protests is infinitesimally small. On any given game day in the league, there are 1,472 active players. The Undefeated reports that roughly 80 percent of the NFL\u2019s players are black, meaning that 1,177 pro football players are African American, give or take.\n\nAside from the two weeks after Trump\u2019s \u201cson of a bitch\u201d comments prompted mass demonstrations, there have never been more than 20 players kneeling for the anthem this season. But if one watches television or reads the news reports, one might believe that the black players in the NFL are in open revolt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though 98 percent of the NFL\u2019s black players have always stood for the flag.\n\nOn Sunday, Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said, \u201cThere is no question the league is suffering negative effects from these protests.\u201d The billionaire\u2019s declaration came after he announced that he would bench any player on his team who knelt during the anthem.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though he is a 75-year-old white man from Arkansas, there probably aren\u2019t many people who personally know Jones who would call him a racist. He\u2019s not the white Malcolm X, either. He is a billionaire oil tycoon who happens to own one of the most popular sports franchises in the world.\n\nWhen Trump made his initial statement on the symbolic act of resistance started by Colin Kaepernick, Jones decided to show support for his black players with a toothless display of unity by kneeling before the anthem. Again, Jones wasn\u2019t being an activist; he was being a capitalist by supporting his employees\u2014the lifeblood of his billion-dollar business.\n\nBut after Trump\u2019s racially charged comments started affecting the league\u2019s bottom line, Jones had no problem throwing his players under the bus by declaring an ultimatum that his black players must obey. He wasn\u2019t necessarily being racist, but his response was most definitely a response to racism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s how white supremacy works.\n\nJones may not have a smidgen of hate or animus toward people of color, but he did not hesitate to institute rules that made his players look like chattel, even though not one Dallas Cowboys player has knelt during the national anthem this season. Or ever. He has dictated a fugitive-slave protest policy for a plantation from which no one was trying to escape.\n\nJones is like the white people who are boycotting the league because of all the players \u201cdisrespecting the flag,\u201d even though the players have continually said that their actions were not a reflection of how they felt about the flag or the anthem.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConservatives have bought into the hype about belligerent black men ruining the NFL game in much the same way that white America buys into the myth of black criminality, even though 99 percent of African Americans have never committed a violent crime.\n\nWhite supremacy has never been about racism. Racism is a belief. Racism is a way of thinking. This is why the distinction between racism and white supremacy is important. One can hold no ill will toward African Americans and still be guilty of racism. It is also possible to hate black people with every fiber of one\u2019s being and still treat them equally in practice and policy. I have never given a damn about racism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhite supremacy is the problem.\n\nWhite supremacy is a cop being afraid for his life when he encounters an unarmed black man, even though 99 percent of black people are as nonviolent and law-abiding as any other citizen. White supremacy is reading a black-sounding name atop a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and suspecting that the person is unqualified or graduated because of affirmative action. White supremacy is buying into the belief that the black family moving in next door will ruin a neighborhood even though they have the same investment in their property as everyone else.\n\nWhite supremacy is not racism, but it is the result of racism. White people participate in white supremacy every day, often unknowingly. It has nothing to do with hate or willful malice. It is accepting the premise of prejudice for one\u2019s own self-interest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is the privilege of valuing the symbols of patriotism over actual lives because the results of injustice or inequality do not affect you. It is feeling annoyed because players used their platform to attempt to save the lives of their sons, daughters, brothers and sisters. White supremacy is believing that the innocuous three minutes before a game \u201cis neither the time nor the place.\u201d White supremacy is believing that there is a time or a place. White supremacy is not hostility or hatred.

Ferry\u2019s comments centered on NBA forward Luol Deng\u2019s African heritage, while Levenson\u2019s emails basically argued that Hawks fans were too black and \u201cthat the black crowd scared away the whites and there are simply not enough affluent black fans to build a sign[i]ficant season ticket base.\u201d\n\n\n\nToday there\u2019s a new ownership group with former Duke and NBA player Grant Hill as a partner. Plus they hired Nzinga \u201cZing\u201d Shaw, as the NBA\u2019s first-ever chief diversity and inclusion officer. They\u2019ve also put on MOSAIC annually since 2016, and for this third year they tapped Hill to give the keynote address with \u201cDisruption\u201d as its theme.\n\nKicking off her address, Hill joked about spending time in Belize and zip-lining for the first time before easing into the White House calling her \u201cDonald Trump is a white supremacist\u201d tweet \u201ca fireable offense\u201d during a press briefing, backed by the man himself on Twitter, of course.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd in case there is anyone who thinks that no one is still riding for Trump, Hill made it clear that they are by sharing details of the snail mail of hate she received along with the social media abuse. \u201cI got called the n-word so much that I thought it was my middle name,\u201d she candidly revealed.\n\n\n\nAll of this happened as Hill was still warming her seat at ESPN\u2019s iconic SportsCenter, dubbed SC6 when she and her longtime co-host, Michael Smith, from the successful His & Hers show, took over in February 2017. ESPN didn\u2019t fire Hill or suspend her for those Trump tweets; rather, the sports network suspended her for another series of tweets in October 2017 that alluded to boycotting Dallas Cowboys advertisers in response to team owner Jerry Jones\u2019 promise to bench players who \u201cdisrespect the flag.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn Atlanta, Hill reiterated that the suspension was justified, noting that \u201cESPN is in the business of sports\u201d and \u201cnot in the business necessarily of being construed as a political organization and I put them firmly in those crosshairs.\u201d She also insisted that it was her decision to leave SC6 and join ESPN microsite The Undefeated to resume her writing career, with hosting TV specials and even creating her own video content as part of the deal.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI never intended to be a disruptor,\u201d she told the crowd. \u201cI never intended to be thrust into a role of activism,\u201d she added, noting that \u201cI didn\u2019t choose the moment; the moment chose me.\u201d\n\nMy worst fears about Hill giving up the fight like so many others whose outspokenness resulted in hard consequences seemed confirmed until she switched it up. As she took on the topics of disruption, diversity and inclusion, she spoke directly to those in hiring positions, who are still overwhelmingly white and male, informing them that people of color and women are experiencing this new old America in ways they can\u2019t even begin to imagine.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn whatever business that you\u2019re in, especially if you\u2019re a woman and you\u2019re a person of color, there\u2019s a level of vulnerability that you feel right now that may be hard for everybody to relate to. You feel a little scared and under attack right now under some of the current policies and tone that our country has taken,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGetting even more real, Hill confessed that, in the current Trump climate and after Charlottesville, Va., especially, there were days she didn\u2019t even want to come to work. \u201cFor the first time in my career,\u201d she admitted, \u201cit kind of put my dual role of person and journalist in conflict with one another.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI never intended to be a disruptor. I never intended to be thrust into a role of activism. I didn\u2019t choose the moment; the moment chose me.\u201d\n\nShe also let those in power know that the solution to diversity and inclusion issues didn\u2019t rest with those of us who didn\u2019t create the problem in the first place, and that hiring some of us was only the first step. \u201cGetting through the door is just one of the problems that needs to be addressed,\u201d she explained. \u201cWe all know there are definitely structures that need to change from a tangible standpoint. We need more women, we need more people of color, you need more LGBTQ people. We know that, but once they make it through the door, then what happens?\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSugarcoating was not on the menu as Hill shared that, in her 20-year career, she knew what it meant to just be a quota. \u201cI\u2019ve had the experience of being wanted for what I represent but not really wanted for what I represent,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what I mean about the difference about once you\u2019re actually through that door.\u201d She added:\n\n\n\nBecause you can talk a lot about wanting us at the table, but will you listen to us once we\u2019re actually in the room? Will you groom and mentor us the way you would somebody that looks like you? Will you invite us to come play golf? Will you invite us out to drinks so that we can network with key people? Will you recommend us for assignments that challenge and grow us? Will you promote us? Fast-track us? Treat us like franchise players and not just sixth men or sixth women that are on the bench? Will you give us credit when we deserve it, even it means that you get a little less credit?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrue diversity and inclusion gets uncomfortable, she said, and companies need to be clear about whether they really want to deal with that:\n\nWhen you start disrupting what your organization looks like, when it starts changing, and it\u2019s very emblematic of what\u2019s happening in this country right now, when the progressiveness gets a little too fast for people, a little too uncomfortable, when they start thinking that someone else\u2019s ascension or having different people in the room is going to mean less for them, then you get the blowback, then you get the brushback, and then you get the criticism, and then you get people who are angry and mad at you, and you have to make that decision in that moment: Am I here to support the people who are mad over really nothing, or am I here to support the people who have never gotten this opportunity or rarely get it?\n\nThe answer to the second half of that question, she said, has largely been a resounding \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou find in a lot of places\u2014they\u2019re more concerned about the people who are mad as opposed to the people they need to welcome,\u201d she explained. \u201cAnd so, if you\u2019re in charge and you\u2019re a thought leader, you have to really be honest with yourself about what you have the stomach to do, especially in tumultuous times.\u201d\n\n\n\nOne of my colleagues, who has seen Hill speak since this whole \u201cTrump is a white supremacist\u201d water-is-wet nonscandal, chastised me for even doubting the \u201cDetroit vs. Everybody\u201d native. So don\u2019t let the headlines sway you as they did me; please know that Hill is still spitting pure truth about what\u2019s really going down for us in this country.", "keywords": ["whats", "white", "spitting", "truth", "hill", "going", "youre", "america", "didnt", "jemele", "trump", "know", "little", "really", "moment", "need"], "polarity": 0.07532926669290302, "subjectivity": 0.5085638856093402},

In the Unapologetic podcast, which Volitich hosts under the alias \u201cTiana Dalichov,\u201d Volitich brags about bringing her racist beliefs into her Crystal River Middle School classroom.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI get to talk about topics that people don\u2019t like to talk about,\u201d Volitich says in one snippet from her podcast, which HuffPost has embedded on its site. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to be seen as a bigot, racist, whatever you want to call it. I honestly don\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nThe screenshots (Volitich also posed as her \u201cTiana Dalichov\u201d alias on Twitter; her account has since been deleted, but as HuffPost knows, screenshots are forever) and podcasts reveal that Volitich certainly didn\u2019t care about being seen as a bigot\u2014in fact, she reveled in wildly racist, debunked beliefs.\n\nFrom HuffPost:\n\nIn her most recent podcast on Feb. 26, a guest railed against diversity in schools, dismissing the idea that \u201ca kid from Nigeria and a kid who came from Sweden are supposed to learn exactly the same\u201d and have the \u201csame IQ.\u201d Volitich enthusiastically agreed with the guest, and went on to argue that \u201cscience\u201d has proven that certain races are smarter than others.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLater in the episode, Volitich also agreed that white supremacists need to infiltrate schools:\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have to be vocal about their views, but get in there!\u201d her guest said. \u201cBe more covert and just start taking over those places.\u201d \u201cRight,\u201d Volitich said. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely one of them.\u201d\n\nAfter the HuffPost story came out, WFTS-TV in Tampa Bay found another article published on the far-right news site Halsey News under the headline \u201cTiana Dalichov: White Privilege Challenge.\u201d In it, Dalichov prompted people to write arguments proving \u201cone single instance of white privilege,\u201d for which she would give them $100.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHuffPost pieced together that Volitich was actually \u201cDalichov\u201d by lining up a series of coincidences. \u201cDalichov\u201d listed her home as Crystal River, which matches public records for Volitich\u2019s home. \u201cDalichov\u201d has shared on her podcast that she\u2019s a schoolteacher who has been teaching at her current school for one year. The same was true for Volitich and her position at Crystal River. \u201cDalichov\u201d tweeted that she was 25 years old, which is Volitich\u2019s age. And after HuffPost reached out to the Citrus County School District about Volitich, \u201cDalichov\u201d mentioned on her Twitter account that she would be going dark for a while.\n\n\n\nBut perhaps the clearest evidence is that Volitich, presumably part of the race that has higher IQs than others, posted an actual picture of herself as the avatar for her \u201cDalichov\u201d Twitter account. As HuffPost notes, not only does it appear to be the same person, but Volitich is also wearing the same earrings in her Twitter photo as she is in the Crystal River Middle School website.\n\nThe most disturbing part of HuffPost\u2019s revelations is that Volitch was consciously indoctrinating her students. As the article notes, the middle school social studies teacher says that her students knew her political beliefs and even helped \u201cplay along\u201d with administrators to help hide them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom one of her podcasts, according to WFTS-TV:\n\n\u201cI told the kids that. I said guys when they are in here I\u2019m going to be different than I usually am. I just don\u2019t want you to be shocked, I want you to play along and they\u2019re like OK. OK,\u201d she said in the podcast.\n\nLater in the podcast, after Volitich\u2019s guest asks her if the kids ever told their parents what they learned in class, she confirms that the principal once followed up with her over an email a parent had sent:\n\n\u201cI had one at the beginning of this year who emailed the principal over my head and basically told her I\u2019m worried that your teacher is injecting political bias into her teaching. And the principal came to me and she was like I\u2019m not worried, should I be worried? And I was like no. And she believed me and she backed off.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNearly 90 percent of Crystal River Middle School is white. The city of Crystal River itself is over 80 percent white, according to the latest census, with black people making up just over 7 percent of the population. Latinx residents account for another 5 percent.\n\n\n\nAs the HuffPost article notes, this isn\u2019t the first high-profile outing of a teacher\u2019s white nationalist identity. Late last year, Splinter News revealed that Greg Conte, a white supremacist who worked for Richard Spencer\u2019s think tank, the National Policy Institute, had gotten a job as an equal-employment officer. He also worked as a substitute teacher at a private high school in Maryland.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd in Louisiana, the principal of a charter school in New Orleans was fired after he was found wearing Nazi-associated rings in a video. He had also appeared on white nationalist podcasts.\n\nSince the story broke, people from around the country have taken to social media to demand that the school district fire Volitich. Neither the Citrus County School District, of which Crystal River is a part, nor Volitich has confirmed the HuffPost story, though the school has told the site that it \u201cwill be looking into the statements she made, checking the validity to see if they violate our code of ethics and policy.\u201d\n\n", "keywords": ["white", "dalichov", "outed", "teacher", "volitich", "dont", "huffpost", "middle", "supremacist", "unapologetic", "river", "crystal", "florida", "podcast", "school"], "polarity": 0.06521878121878123, "subjectivity": 0.31108824508824506},

I absolutely get that jobs are scarce and nice checks for those who truly \u201cstarted from the bottom, now we\u2019re here\u201d are extremely rare. But sometimes, wanting to stay out of the unemployment line can go too far. Just think about how many people you know who have checked out at their jobs because it\u2019s just easier to go along to get along.\n\n\n\nSo when I attended the Atlanta Hawks\u2019 diversity-inclusion symposium, MOSAIC (Model of Shaping Atlanta Through Inclusive Conversations), last week, I really expected Hill to continue walking the \u201cjust trying to keep my job\u201d tone of her statement. In my experience, many companies do these events just to look like they\u2019re doing something. Rarely are real issues even touched.

We know that, but once they make it through the door, then what happens?\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSugarcoating was not on the menu as Hill shared that, in her 20-year career, she knew what it meant to just be a quota. \u201cI\u2019ve had the experience of being wanted for what I represent but not really wanted for what I represent,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what I mean about the difference about once you\u2019re actually through that door.\u201d She added:\n\n\n\nBecause you can talk a lot about wanting us at the table, but will you listen to us once we\u2019re actually in the room? Will you groom and mentor us the way you would somebody that looks like you? Will you invite us to come play golf? Will you invite us out to drinks so that we can network with key people? Will you recommend us for assignments that challenge and grow us? Will you promote us? Fast-track us? Treat us like franchise players and not just sixth men or sixth women that are on the bench? Will you give us credit when we deserve it, even it means that you get a little less credit?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrue diversity and inclusion gets uncomfortable, she said, and companies need to be clear about whether they really want to deal with that:\n\nWhen you start disrupting what your organization looks like, when it starts changing, and it\u2019s very emblematic of what\u2019s happening in this country right now, when the progressiveness gets a little too fast for people, a little too uncomfortable, when they start thinking that someone else\u2019s ascension or having different people in the room is going to mean less for them, then you get the blowback, then you get the brushback, and then you get the criticism, and then you get people who are angry and mad at you, and you have to make that decision in that moment: Am I here to support the people who are mad over really nothing, or am I here to support the people who have never gotten this opportunity or rarely get it?\n\nThe answer to the second half of that question, she said, has largely been a resounding \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou find in a lot of places\u2014they\u2019re more concerned about the people who are mad as opposed to the people they need to welcome,\u201d she explained. \u201cAnd so, if you\u2019re in charge and you\u2019re a thought leader, you have to really be honest with yourself about what you have the stomach to do, especially in tumultuous times.\u201d\n\n\n\nOne of my colleagues, who has seen Hill speak since this whole \u201cTrump is a white supremacist\u201d water-is-wet nonscandal, chastised me for even doubting the \u201cDetroit vs. Everybody\u201d native.

When I write \u201cslave,\u201d I am not using it in the narrow sense of the mid-Atlantic holocaust perpetrated against African people. I\u2019m using it in the correct sense. I\u2019m using it according to the definition of the word. I\u2019m using it according to every definition of the word.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Oxford Dictionary defines a slave as:\n\nA person who is the legal property of another and is forced to obey them. 1.1 A person who works very hard without proper remuneration or appreciation. 1.2 A person who is excessively dependent upon or controlled by something. 1.3 A device, or part of one, directly controlled by another.\n\nAccording to ESPN, which is keeping a week-by-week tally of which professional football players protest this season during the playing of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner,\u201d this past Sunday only 10 NFL players participated in protesting racial inequality by kneeling or refusing to stand during the national anthem\u2014the fewest this season. Other players protested by raising fists during the song, staying in the tunnel or demonstrating before the anthem.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday at 6 p.m., ESPN will air another version of Sportscenter, the network\u2019s most popular version of its flagship program, without anchor Jemele Hill. Hill is serving a two-week suspension for tweets that the company said violates its social media policy.\n\nWhen Sportscenter hits the air, one of the lead stories will probably be about the University of Louisville\u2019s decision on whether it will fire head coach Rick Pitino. Pitino has been implicated in a FBI investigation that alleges that he and a number of officials at other NCAA colleges paid third parties hundreds of thousands of dollars to secure recruits to their individual university athletics programs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are some who will counter that the decrees of these organizations are no different from the rules and contractual obligations of any other employer for any other company. They are correct. But here is the difference between the NFL, ESPN and NCAA and other organizations:\n\nThe NFL\u2019s black players are not being disciplined because of infractions. The NCAA is not cherry-picking which coaches to target for violating NCAA rules. Hill is not being censured for breaking ESPN\u2019s policy. Each of these entities knows that it cannot profit without the absolute control of the livestock whose talent and toiling line the pockets of the overseers. The suspensions, fines and proposed benchings are not a play for order and fairness. They are meant to assert control. They are proclamations of ownership.\n\nA person who is the legal property of another and is forced to obey them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSlavery has absolutely nothing to do with pay. It is about ownership. It is about control.\n\nOn Tuesday, Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said: \u201cThe policy and my actions are going to be if you don\u2019t honor and stand for the flag in a way that a lot of our fans feel that you should, if that\u2019s not the case, then you won\u2019t play.\u201d Jones is within his rights to do so because of a quiet change in NFL policy that allows the league and individual owners to discipline players for not standing for the anthem.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRoughly 80 percent of the NFL\u2019s players are black. One hundred percent of the NFL\u2019s majority owners are white. But this issue is not about color; nor does it have anything to do with the flag or the anthem. It is about a group of billionaires knowing that they cannot allow the bodies they ostensibly \u201cown\u201d to coalesce into a united, vocal force. It is about stamping out rebellion and resistance.\n\nIt is about forcing their legal property to obey.\n\nThis is the same with ESPN and Jemele Hill. ESPN claims that Hill violated its social media policy by tweeting her opinions from her personal social media account. ESPN\u2019s policy states:\n\nWriters, reporters, producers and editors directly involved in \u201chard\u201d news reporting, investigative or enterprise assignments and related coverage should refrain in any public-facing forum from taking positions on political or social issues, candidates or office holders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile it is debatable whether Hill is considered a \u201creporter,\u201d ESPN\u2019s rules also say:\n\nOutside of \u201chard\u201d news reporting, commentary related to political or social issues, candidates or office holders is appropriate on ESPN platforms consistent with these guidelines.\u201d The topic should be related to a current issue impacting sports.\n\nESPN pays Hill, in part, because she is black and outspoken. The network monetized her unapologetic blackness in the same way the NFL capitalizes on its mostly black workforce. According to AdAge, since ESPN moved Hill and co-host Michael Smith to their flagship program, the show\u2019s audience is 12 years younger and has increased its Hispanic and African-American audience by 39 percent, attracting better and higher-paying advertisers. Never forget how the network chose to promote the new, hip SC6 when it named Hill and Smith as anchors:\n\nESPN wants the unapologetic blackness without the unapologetic part. Or the black part. To ensure that, the network twisted its rules and contorted itself into a bullwhip to make sure Hill knows what not to say. How not to act. If she is to be the network\u2019s legal property, it wants to make sure she knows that she should obey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCollege athletes are no different. The FBI investigation that claimed Pitino\u2019s inviolability arbitrarily focused on a group of schools where boosters were funneling money between coaches, sports agents and shoe companies to get top recruits to commit to certain colleges. You know who wasn\u2019t making any money?\n\nCollege players.\n\nAlmost every analyst and expert who covers college sports says that these kinds of deals take place at almost every high-profile university athletic program. The NCAA, like the NFL and ESPN, selectively enforces its rules to ensure the steady flow of free labor that enriches the institution without compensating the players\u2014or, as the definition of slavery says, \u201cwithout proper remuneration or appreciation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen an investigation exposed the University of North Carolina\u2019s sham African-American-studies program that gave athletes fake grades for 18 years, absolutely nothing happened. When poor black students complete four years of eligibility without a degree after making millions for their colleges, absolutely nothing happens. College athletes can\u2019t obtain outside employment without permission. They can\u2019t leave the plantation schools if their current college won\u2019t allow it. They are \u201cexcessively dependent\u201d on their universities.\n\nWhen Donald Trump suggested that ESPN should terminate Jemele Hill or that NFL owners should fire \u201cthat son of a bitch\u201d who \u201cdisrespects our flag,\u201d he knew what he was doing. It wasn\u2019t simply a call to white supremacists who wrap themselves in patriotism because it is the \u201clast refuge of the scoundrel.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a dog whistle to his base.\n\nIt was a plea to make America great again. It was a not-so-subtle reminder that no matter how rich, successful, talented or accomplished a black person in America may be ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\n... that black person can still be a slave.", "keywords": ["rules", "espn", "hill", "nfl", "jerry", "jones", "players", "black", "jemele", "system", "ncaa", "slave", "person", "social", "policy"], "polarity": 0.040663910831436605, "subjectivity": 0.43705389684771123},

While we are led to believe that the most dangerous individuals in this country are those who read the Koran, lack a Social Security number or have dark skin, white male domestic terrorists go unnamed and unchallenged.\n\n\n\nThough you would be hard-pressed to hear it articulated in mainstream-media outlets, far-right violent extremists have made up 74 percent of officially designated terrorist attacks in the U.S. since 9/11. And this does not even include the increasing number of ostensibly nonideological mass shooters who fit a now well-known profile: angry white men, often with histories of domestic abuse, who enjoy unfettered access to firearms. Though our president, the National Rifle Association and Congress, which does its bidding, would certainly prefer to see these individuals as mentally ill lone wolves, it seems abundantly clear that they represent a now growing cultural movement within our country: a loose brotherhood of suicidal copycats, inspired to express their anger through mass murder with easily accessible tools.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany will balk at the notion that white male violence goes \u201cunchallenged.\u201d After all, it was a white man who exchanged gunfire with the Sutherland Springs, Texas, killer, and there have been countless white people who have heroically intervened to capture white killers and attend to their victims. What we are referring to here, however, is not the bravery and good intentions of individual people but the systemic means by which our policymakers either target or ignore different forms of violence.\n\nA whole federal government office has been opened to hear the voices of those affected by the crimes of undocumented immigrants, even though immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than the general public; a blanket ban has been proposed on Muslims from half a dozen countries, even though such a ban would have saved no lives over the last 20 years; a multibillion-dollar border wall has been proposed, even though \u201csecure border\u201d advocates widely acknowledge that a wall will make minimal difference. And when it comes to urban gun violence, rather than prescribe proven strategies to reduce shootings, the bipartisan solution over the last 40 years has been to lock up black and brown men in droves.\n\nThis obsession with blaming the \u201cother\u201d has so consumed white leaders that even when white men kill innocent white children in schools and churches, or when a white male supremacist runs over and kills a white woman protesting white supremacy, many seem incapable of absorbing or naming what is happening right before their eyes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe bottom line is that a federal government largely made up of white men seems to have real difficulty acknowledging white male violence. The GOP battered President Barack Obama over his refusal to use the term \u201cIslamic terror,\u201d and yet both Democratic and Republican leaders seem to have a strange nervous tick when it is time to name \u201cwhite domestic terror.\u201d Truth be told, even politicians of color\u2014nourished on a lifelong diet of white movie heroes, Eurocentric school curricula and images of a blond, blue-eyed Jesus\u2014seem conditioned to accept the notion that only \u201cMuslim\u201d terror is real terror.\n\nThe result is that the NRA-backed GOP leaders\u2019 main prescription for keeping us safe is to purchase more guns, somehow trying to convince us that a safe and sane society is one where schoolteachers, church deacons and single mothers must carry pistols and be prepared to engage in impromptu firefights with AR-15-toting lunatics.\n\nSimultaneously, the vast majority of Democratic leaders enthusiastically fund anti-terrorist efforts abroad while remaining silent about the true nature of much of the violence at home, with images of Islamic extremists and black \u201csuperpredators\u201d apparently still dominating their imaginations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnly when our government has launched a \u201cwar on white supremacy\u201d and a \u201cwar on gun violence\u201d will we have a true \u201cwar on terror\u201d and become convinced that our safety is truly its main concern.\n\nThe Rev.

He has made this plain repeatedly and unambiguously with his words, his actions, his policies and his appointments, since his only political agenda is to retain the value of whiteness (white maleness, particularly) and reverse everything his black predecessor did.\n\nRecently, he specifically targeted his ire at the predominantly black athletes of the NFL (and NBA), calling on his friends (the white owners) and his base (the mostly white fans) to put these men in their place.

The entire indictment focused on how the charged parties used social media to organize pro-Donald Trump and anti-Hillary Clinton rallies and took on fake social media profiles, especially on Twitter and Facebook.\n\n\n\nMuch of this was designed to spark racial strife between white people and minority groups in an attempt to disrupt the 2016 presidential election and benefit Trump. The black guys on YouTube dissing Hillary Clinton and the notorious GOP Tennessee Twitter account, among many more of their kind, have been well-covered. Still, there is no evidence that any of these efforts swayed people to vote one way or the other.\n\nBuzzFeed asked experts if they believed that Russia\u2019s disinformation campaign was responsible for decreased black turnout in 2016, and none of them could say that was the case. Chryl Laird, a government professor at Bowdoin College in Maine, said that turnout was lower in 2016 than in 2012 because black voters simply weren\u2019t as excited about Clinton as they had been about Barack Obama. Instead, 2016 turnout should be compared with that of 2004, when it was more than 60 percent. \u201cObama would be considered a statistical outlier,\u201d Laird told BuzzFeed.\n\nI really don\u2019t see how Twitter bots discouraged black folks, least of all black women, from casting a ballot. Black voter turnout in presidential years has been on the uptick since the the mid-1990s. Of course, Obama was a once-in-a-lifetime president, and therefore, the black turnout would reflect that. In 2012, 66.6 percent of eligible black voters cast ballots, according to the Pew Research Center. That number dipped to 59.6 percent in 2016. That\u2019s just slightly below the 61.4 percent for overall voters that year.\n\nEvery available study finds that black men and women overwhelmingly voted for Hillary Clinton. Not sure Russian trolls had much impact. Now, voter suppression is another story. Then there is also this thing about older black folks having to risk their lives to vote and passing that tradition down to their children. If Jim Crow could not stop black folk from voting, I doubt that a Twitter troll would have more impact.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd I also doubt that Twitter bots made Trump supporters more racist. I am sure the Republicans who believed that Obama was a Muslim back in 2015 didn\u2019t need a bot to fuel their hate even more in 2016.\n\nThat said, I\u2019m suspicious of any article that argues Russian bots discouraged black voter turnout or encouraged white folks to be even more racist than they already are. Trump won because many white Americans wanted to maintain white supremacy.\n\nThank all of the Beckys\u2014aka the 53 percenters\u2014for that, not some unknown Twitter bot in Moscow.", "keywords": ["white", "russian", "2016", "stop", "bots", "twitter", "clinton", "voters", "peoples", "obama", "black", "turnout", "trump", "racism", "blaming"], "polarity": 0.05121882086167799, "subjectivity": 0.4058673469387756},

That they get to walk around in normal society hiding in plain sight is the scary part. Most people of color would rather see a Nazi in full regalia waving a Confederate flag than a police officer with hate hidden in the cavity behind their badge because that is how institutional racism is the real killer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere are four stories that shed light on how institutional bias is embedded in the fabric of America, manifesting itself in unseen ways every day:\n\n1. John Kelly calls immigrants \u201ctoo lazy to get off their asses.\u201d\n\nWhen White House chief of staff John Kelly said on Tuesday that the reason for the low number of people who registered for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program was \u201cthe people that some would say were too afraid to sign up, others would say were too lazy to get off their asses,\u201d media outlets immediately pointed out that his statement was kind of racist in the same way that fire is kind of warm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn October 2017, after Rep. Frederica Wilson (D-Fla.), a black woman, called out President Donald Trump on his racist treatment of a war veteran\u2019s wife, Kelly defended his boss by creating a story out of thin air accusing Wilson, a black woman, of basically being too uppity, referring to her as an \u201cempty barrel.\u201d A few days later, Kelly said in an interview that he believed Robert E. Lee, who led a war against his own country to preserve the institution of slavery, was an \u201chonorable man.\u201d Some would say that Kelly fit the description of a Klansman who finally decided to remove his hood.\n\nBut here is the thing that no one seems to mention: John Kelly is a longtime, decorated general in the U.S. Marine Corps. Even though his racism is surfacing only recently, it is unlikely that Kelly cultivated his racist beliefs after signing on as the chief of staff for President Trumpty Dumpty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor his entire professional life, Kelly has been in charge of the careers and lives of thousands of black and brown members of the military. While we know that the only thing wypipo love more than dogs and guitar-based music is \u201cthe troops,\u201d it is impossible to now believe that a man who holds prejudice in his heart and mind like a Lynyrd Skynyrd song treated his underlings fairly.\n\nI\u2019m not saying John Kelly definitely took every opportunity to discriminate against the soldiers he was in charge of; I\u2019m just saying that\u2019s what a real racist would do, and Kelly has proved that he is a real racist.\n\n2. The \u201calt-right\u201d is killing people.\n\nWhen the forward-thinking Richard Spencer decided to rebrand white supremacy as the \u201calternative right,\u201d it was a brilliant move. The new name distanced its adherents from the sordid, violent past of their predecessors in an effort to cast themselves as part of a political movement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut they are still doing the same thing.\n\nA new report by the Southern Poverty Law Center finds that the alt-right is responsible for more than 100 killings or injuries since 2014, including 60 deaths or injuries in 2017 alone. SPLC determined that most of the perpetrators of this violence were young (average age 25) white males.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow are these incidents related to institutional racism?\n\nWell, would you call the Federal Bureau of Investigation an \u201cinstitution\u201d? Because it issued a warning to law enforcement agencies around the country against the rise of \u201cblack identity extremists,\u201d but it doesn\u2019t have a similar designation for white groups.\n\nInstitutions like the Department of Homeland Security issue reports about foreign-born terrorists, but the white boys who kill more people get a pass. The executive branch of the U.S. government is an institution whose powers are enshrined in the Constitution. That\u2019s why they can pre-emptively call for a travel ban from Muslim countries instead of slapping a ban on Confederate flags and white boys who wear trench coats.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut those black identity extremists, though.\n\n3. A neo-Nazi turns out to be a fake war veteran.\n\nThe New York Times seems to find Nazis fascinating. It recently did a story on Elliott Kline, a rising figure in the white supremacy movement. The story was about how Kline had convinced so many alt-right followers that he was a veteran of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, where he was a sniper who killed \u201cscores of dirty Arabs\u201d (not my words).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt turns out that Kline was ... well ... just a regular old original-recipe white boy who had never been deployed during his stint in the National Guard (I told y\u2019all that wypipo love \u201cthe troops\u201d\u2014even Elliott knows). But hidden in the story, glossed over by every outlet that reported the news, was an interesting fact:\n\nKline\u2019s day job was as a \u201chuman resources administrator.\u201d The position is described by Payscale as:\n\nThe first point of contact within a company for all HR-related inquiries. Specific tasks include handling employment contracts, recruiting, and setting up interviews for open positions in the company. Additionally, HR administrators oversee other HR personnel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Nazi. The fake thug.\n\nWhen you read reports like this one from the National Bureau of Economic Research, which shows that job applicants with white-sounding names need to send 10 job applications to get a callback, while those with black-sounding names have to send 15 on average to get a response, this is how that happens. The Economic Policy Institute will tell you that blacks are paid less than whites at every level of education, but no one knows exactly why.\n\nAfrican Americans are paid less than whites at every education level While the economy continues to improve and wages are finally beginning to inch up for most\u2026 Read more Read\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsk Elliott Kline.\n\n4. Republicans are trying to stop the white genocide.\n\nYou\u2019ve heard of the white-genocide theory (no, that is not wishing you could go back in time and make the Kardashians disappear\u2014that\u2019s \u201cJenner-cide\u201d). White genocide is the kooky, white supremacist conspiracy theory that because of diversity efforts, immigration and the potency of black sperm, whites will soon be extinct.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be fair, black people say absurd things, too. We talk with too much hyperbole. We all know Republicans can be \u201csemiracist\u201d (\u201csemi\u201d comes from the Latin word that means \u201cas a motherfucker,\u201d right?). But when we call their immigration efforts an \u201cethnic cleansing plan\u201d and say it is the Trump administration\u2019s effort to maintain white people\u2019s precipitous grip on their population majority, perhaps we are going too far. There\u2019s no evidence of that.\n\nWell, actually ...\n\nThe Washington Post reports that Trump\u2019s immigration plan would delay the date that white people become the minority in the country by as many as five years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor years the Census Bureau has been saying that people of color will outnumber non-Hispanic whites by 2044. But according to the Post\u2019s analysis, Trump\u2019s proposal could push the date back to as far as 2049.\n\nCouple that with Paul Ryan\u2019s statement Tuesday, which echoes the sentiments of the white genocide theory. When discussing entitlement reform, the fully grown Eddie Munster said, \u201cPeople ... I did my part, but we need to have higher birth rates in this country.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite their ridiculous hairstyle choices, these men aren\u2019t fringe kooks in some dark corner of the internet talking shit. These are two of the most powerful men in the world. They not only create and pass legislation\u2014Ryan and Trump can also prevent any bill from becoming law.\n\nThese stories show the difference between racism and white supremacy. While it might be salacious to talk about hate rallies, Confederate statues or white women screaming the n-word in Starbucks, the real-world application of institutional racism is far more insidious.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are people who laugh at the discussion of white supremacy like they laugh at people who believe in ghosts. They think we are paranoid. They say we believe it exists even when there is nothing there. But racism is a monster with gnashing teeth lurking in the shadows, harmless and invisible to those who are immune.\n\nOh, what a privilege it must be to have never seen the ghost.", "keywords": ["white", "john", "whites", "supremacy", "works", "real", "racist", "black", "say", "racism", "roundup", "kelly", "institutional"], "polarity": 0.031041552344369255, "subjectivity": 0.4264844896887151},

It was included as an exhibit to a lawsuit, filed in federal court by the NFL Players\u2019 Association, demanding that Elliott\u2019s league-issued suspension be vacated. In its lawsuit, the NFLPA calls what transpired \u201cone of the most fundamentally unfair arbitral processes conceivable.\u201d\n\n... Elliott and the Union were subjected to an arbitration process in which, among other things, there was a League-orchestrated conspiracy by senior NFL executives, including NFL Senior Vice President and Special Counsel for Investigations Lisa Friel, to hide critical information\u2014which would completely exonerate Elliott\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElliott was suspended by the league for six games for violating the NFL\u2019s personal conduct policy. The NFL investigation started after his ex-girlfriend accused him of domestic violence. Prosecutors in Columbus, Ohio, investigated but declined to bring charges, saying there was \u201cconflicting and inconsistent information across all incidents resulting in concern regarding the sufficiency of the evidence to support the filing of criminal charges.\u201d The NFL conducted its own investigation and found that Elliott \u201chad used physical force\u201d against Tiffany Thompson. But the details of how the league reached that conclusion haven\u2019t been public until now.\n\nBefore reading the report, know that the complaint alleges it is incomplete and flawed. Thompson was interviewed six times, but just twice were those interviews transcribed. The NFL\u2019s report doesn\u2019t reach a conclusion and excludes certain key pieces of information, the lawsuit claims (bold is as produced in the complaint).\n\nFirst, after repeated questioning, Friel admitted that it was Roberts\u2019 conclusion that after review of the totality of the evidence, there was insufficient evidence to corroborate Thompson\u2019s version of events. Arb. Hr\u2019g Tr. (Aug. 30), Ex. C. at 301:22-302:4. Friel admitted that this conclusion was excluded from the Elliott report, as a result of a decision that she made with NFL counsel\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe lawsuit also takes issue with many parts of the arbitration and hearing process\u2014it says that not having Thompson present for questioning was unfair.\n\nStill, this is the report that the NFL produced. It reads like the opposite of an investigative report. It opens with summaries of the events and then, at page 78, goes into detailed accounts of each interview, following the timeline of the investigative process. Unlike the NFL\u2019s letter to Elliott upon announcing his suspension, it does not state any definitive conclusions about who is right, who is wrong, or what might have happened. Unless indicated otherwise, everything that follows is from the NFL report.\n\nThe first part of the report is a summary. Here are significant parts from that section:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey met around Thompson\u2019s 19th birthday, in early 2015. She eventually considered herself his girlfriend; Elliott said she was just one of many women that he slept with.\n\nIn March of last year, the report states, Thompson found out she was pregnant with twins. Elliott told her to get an abortion; initially, Thompson told him that she did not want to. But she miscarried one of the twins a few weeks later, and she had an abortion to end the pregnancy soon after. One of Elliott\u2019s close friends, Alvarez Jackson, accompanied her to the abortion. Though the report notes that Thompson initially miscarried before going through with the decision to have an abortion to fully terminate the pregnancy, in the direct excerpt of investigators\u2019 interview with her, there is no mention of the miscarriage:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the first alleged incident from the week of July 16th:\n\nThe two were lying in bed between 4 and 5 a.m. on July 17 when a woman from Dallas Facetimed Elliott. When Thompson asked him about it, she said that he tried to have sex with her, and when she said no, he tried to have anal sex with her. She said no again, and Elliott became angry; he \u201cyanks me out of the bed and pushes me up against the door by holding me with both of his hands,\u201d Thompson told NFL investigators. \u201cHe chokes me and says, \u2018What did I tell you?\u2019\u201d\n\nElliott denied arguing with Thompson that night\u2014saying that another woman had Facetimed him, but that Thompson understood he was sleeping with other women\u2014and denied physically fighting her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThompson texted her aunt pictures of her bruised arms, neck and shoulders the next day. (The NFL investigation confirmed that the metadata showed the photographs were taken in the apartment on that day.) The NFL had two different medical experts review the photographs as part of the investigation. Both noted that several of Thompson\u2019s bruises did not appear to be fresh\u2014a week or two old\u2014while others looked consistent with bruises suffered within 24 hours of the photos being taken.\n\n(The NFLPA\u2019s lawsuit takes issue with these experts, saying \u201cUltimately, it was established that neither doctor could rule out the fact that the bruises depicted were consistent with numerous other possible causes apart from the allegations of abuse, including drunken and drug-induced falls, fights with other persons, rough sex and other possible causes.\u201d)\n\nOn the second alleged incident from that week:\n\nOn the night of July 17, Thompson went to work at a restaurant where she was a bottle service waitress. Elliott called her 20 times between 2:40 and 3:20 a.m. because he was locked out of the apartment and she had a key. When she returned to the apartment, she claimed that she found him yelling in the parking lot with his friend Alvarez Jackson. He opened the passenger door to her car, she said, and \u201creached over and grabbed her by the arm and pushed her back against the seat and grabbed the keys out of her hand.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the third alleged incident from that week:\n\nElliott denied this incident happened, saying that the two had argued about her refusal to leave the apartment but that there had never been anything physical:\n\nOn the fourth alleged incident from that week.\n\nElliott denied this account of an alleged incident in the early morning hours of July 22, at Elliott\u2019s birthday party, held at a Columbus club, telling investigators he never put his hands on Thompson.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOutside Elliott\u2019s birthday party, Thompson allegedly got in a fight with another woman. She claimed that there was no physical contact between the two other than hair-pulling. But a club security officer and two off-duty police officers working the event said that they saw the women throwing punches at one another, though they did not believe that any of the punches landed. A friend of Thompson\u2019s, Ayrin Mason, provided the following to Columbus police:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMason later told NFL investigators a different story, saying that there was no punching or kicking and that Thompson sustained no bruising in the fight.\n\n\n\nFollowing Elliott\u2019s birthday party at the club, he invited a smaller group to an afterparty at his apartment. (It is not clear if Thompson was invited or not, but she was there.) Thompson and Mason arrived before Elliott and were waiting in the parking lot when he showed up in a car driven by another woman. Thompson claimed that Elliott \u201cdragged her\u201d away when she tried to confront him, but all other witnesses interviewed by the NFL said this was not so:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThompson then called the police. She said she had domestic violence to report, caused by her boyfriend and that \u201che [had] been doing it for the past five days.\u201d When asked if he had hit her and where, she said, \u201call over.\u201d She told the 911 operator that she did not need a medic at that moment but would probably have to go urgent care at some point. Thompson also texted Mason, instructing her to tell the police that Elliott had physically dragged her out of the car. (These texts could not be obtained by NFL investigators, but the Columbus police accessed them and noted them in their initial report.) Thompson told the NFL that the texts were her telling Mason to tell the truth about what she saw. From Mason\u2019s account of the evening:\n\nPolice soon arrived, and Thompson told them that Elliott had assaulted her several times that week before finally yanking her right arm and dragging her out of the car just before her 911 call. Elliott said that he had not ever laid a hand on her and that any bruises she had were from her fight with another woman outside the club that night. Police did not file any charges that night due to the conflicting stories, and they told Thompson that she could go to the prosecutor\u2019s office to further discuss potential charges if she would like.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLater that day, Thompson went public with her allegations of domestic abuse in an Instagram post. That afternoon, her father took her to the city attorney\u2019s office. An intake officer there noted injuries on Thompson\u2019s knees, hands, lower arms, right shoulder and across her neck.\n\nA week later, Mason texted Thompson, \u201cDo you want me to lie about what happened that night be zekes lawyer is about to call me again.\u201d Mason told the NFL, however, that she had only sent that text because Elliott had asked her to do so\u2014saying that his lawyers would need explicit proof that Thompson asked Mason to lie.\n\nAfter a bit of back and forth, two hours later, Thompson responded to Mason \u201cDon\u2019t lie if you didn\u2019t see anything happen then don\u2019t say you did.\u201d Mason told her that she hadn\u2019t lied to the lawyer and that she hadn\u2019t even been asked about that part of the evening.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNext comes the second half of the report, which follows the order of the interviews conducted.\n\nTiffany Thompson, Sept. 26.\n\nThe NFL investigator repeatedly asked Thompson to explain differences between what she said and what other people have said. Here are a few:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElliott\u2019s interview\n\nOn Sept. 28, the NFL\u2019s investigator talked to Elliott, who repeatedly denied hitting Thompson. When he was asked if he ever saw any injuries, such as bruising, he said: \u201cShe always would have bruises because she\u2019s a small girl and she used to get really drunk and fall all over the place. I mean, she would have bruises sometimes, but I really didn\u2019t see anything out of the normal.\u201d\n\nElliott didn\u2019t consider Thompson his girlfriend; he said it was a \u201csexual\u201d relationship, although he did provide her with financial support and helped pay for her apartment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe described it this way: \u201cBut I never was in a, was at a moment that I, did she ever think that we were in a relationship. She never at no time thought that she was the only girl that I was involved with. That\u2019s all.\u201d\n\nHe also talked several times about threats, he said, she made to ruin his life:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere is another mention of a threat:\n\nThe alleged threats come up again on the night she called police, when, Elliott told investigators, that Thompson said nobody would believe him because she\u2019s white and he\u2019s black.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSecond talk with Thompson, Oct. 6\n\nInvestigators have only a few questions for Thompson, including if she told anyone else in her family about the abuse. She said she told her Aunt Elaine and her mom. They also asked her why she she kept seeing Elliott. She told them \u201cI can\u2019t explain it; it was really bipolar. We had good times and really bad times.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMcKaila Blades, Oct. 6\n\nBlades told NFL investigator Kia Wright Roberts that she had been friends with Thompson since the sixth grade, but Thompson had changed after meeting Elliott. She told Roberts: \u201cI don\u2019t know her anymore. She has a different outlook on life that I do. She hasn\u2019t even called to check on my dad with him having leukemia. She doesn\u2019t care.\u201d She was asked if she ever saw Thompson with a bruised face.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAyrin Mason, Oct. 6\n\nMason said she knew about the fighting but never heard about physical domestic violence before July 21. That day, Thompson showed her bruises and said, \u201cI can\u2019t do this anymore.\u201d She added that in the past she had gotten pictures of bruises from Thompson with captions like \u201cThe sex was rough, LOL.\u201d Despite all this, and a plan to file a police report, they went to Elliott\u2019s birthday party that night because \u201cshe knew there would be other girls there and wanted to prevent anything from happening with Ezekiel and them...she really does love him.\u201d\n\nMason said this about the text messages and the request to lie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElaine Glenn, Oct. 6\n\nIn her first interview, Thompson\u2019s aunt talked about how she told Thompson not to get an abortion. She went into detail about how Thompson\u2019s parents didn\u2019t like Elliott because \u201cthey knew that he was a college football player, and they were always out drinking.\u201d Elliott ended up financially supporting her because her parents wouldn\u2019t even let her drive her car to see him and Elliott \u201cwanted her to go to college and become something.\u201d\n\nGlenn said Thompson had told her about domestic violence, texting her pictures of injuries. Once she Facetimed with Thompson, who insisted it was \u201ctough love.\u201d She said she saw the injuries during a FaceTime on July 18. Before July, she said:\n\nSeveral times l suspected that he was doing things to her, but she always said that she had fell or blacked out. I\u2019ve been a victim of domestic violence before for years, and I know how people live. I didn\u2019t believe her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThompson\u2019s aunt would go into greater detail with investigators about the abortion. She said that she tried to talk Thompson out of it because \u201cabortion is murder.\u201d Instead, it ended with Thompson blocking her.\n\nAyrin Mason, Oct. 13:\n\nThe NFL questioned Mason about two text messages, including one from July 18 in which Thompson said she was going to call the cops. Mason\u2019s answers aren\u2019t much. After that, according to a footnote, she stopped cooperating with investigators, On March 13, she sent them an email saying she would not longer cooperate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTiffany Thompson, Nov. 1\n\nThey go over the abuse, again, in chronological order.\n\nProsecutor Robert Tobias, Nov. 1\n\nTobias went over his investigation with Roberts. He talked a bit about Mason, saying that even when she cooperated, he felt like she did not want to be involved. Tobias also spoke about Alvarez Jackson, who he says told him that \u201cnone of those things had ever happened, and that he never intervened in anything.\u201d He also said that officers at the club described the fight between Thompson and the woman differently. Thompson and Mason described it as brief but \u201cthe police officers described it as flying, punching, and falling to the ground.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the text about lying: \u201cOnce we saw the whole string, it later said Tiffany told her not to lie.\u201d On the other witnesses, he noted: \u201cWe felt like the witnesses really rallied around their respective sides.\u201d\n\n\u201cTiffany just said that she wanted him to get counseling. Not vindictive, didn\u2019t seem like she had a vendetta. I feel like something definitely happened here. She had bruising. We couldn\u2019t determine exactly when and how she got the bruises, so we couldn\u2019t charge him. But that doesn\u2019t mean something didn\u2019t happen here.\u201d\n\nTessie Thompson, Nov. 3\n\nThompson\u2019s mother told Roberts that she saw bruises, but that her daughter probably confided more to her sister\u2014Thompson\u2019s aunt\u2014than her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElaine Glenn, Nov. 15\n\nRoberts had questions about text messages between Elliott and Glenn around the time of the call to Aventura police. In the messages, Elliott says he is scared for Thompson. Glenn tells them, \u201cThey truly did care about each other, but her family life isn\u2019t great.\u201d\n\nTiffany Thompson, Nov. 16\n\nTony Thompson, Nov. 29\n\nTiffany Thompson, Nov. 30\n\nTiffany Thompson, Dec. 5:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe sex tape\n\nOn Thompson\u2019s decision to look into selling a sex tape of her and Elliott after the prosecutor\u2019s office declined to bring charges:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther evidence\n\nThe NFL requested that Elliott provide his texts and call logs with Thompson over a certain period, but he provided \u201credacted, incomplete\u201d records: \u201cNone of the records provided contained the substance of any text messages, nor the call logs from from Mr. Elliott\u2019s two cell phones and to date, such evidence has not been provided.\u201d\n\nOn the medical experts\u2019 analysis of Thompson\u2019s bruises in the available photographs:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe report is one of dozens of exhibits attached to the NFLPA\u2019s court filing, and we\u2019re still going through them.

Oswalt pleaded not guilty to all charges Thursday.

He will also have to surrender four firearms that authorities say they discovered in his home.\n\nAccording to the news site, Oswalt drew attention to himself last week after he wrote about some of his trash views in a student newspaper article, sparking outrage on the campus.\n\nIt turns out that last week was also the first time he was arrested on suspicion of criminal mischief for what authorities say was his little bumper sticker stunt last summer off campus.

But as the derivative hashtag #OscarsSoBlackAndWhite rears its ugly head once again this year, it\u2019s worth revisiting a countertradition: the anti-black resentments that bubble up from nonblack people of color who blame black people for their own communities\u2019 underrepresentation.\n\nWith high-profile nominations going to Mudbound\u2019s Mary J. Blige, The Shape of Water\u2019s Octavia Spencer, Get Out\u2019s Daniel Kaluuya and Jordan Peele, and Roman J. Israel, Esq.\u2019s Denzel Washington, conversations on Oscars diversity have now turned to the admittedly poor showing for Asian and Latinx actors this year (while the question of Native American underrepresentation continues to be sidelined).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s true\u2014this makes the sixth year in a row that no Latinx actors have been nominated for an acting Academy Award, and only 1 percent of Oscar nominations have gone to Asian actors in the past 89 (!) years. And yet the vitriol and rhetoric of #OscarsSoBlackAndWhite make clear that the hashtag is about more than addressing (nonblack) Latinx and Asian underrepresentation: it\u2019s an outlet for anti-black claims that black people are \u201chogging\u201d all the diversity.\n\n\n\nIt comes down to a pervasive and wildly ahistorical belief that black people wield privilege and power over nonblack people of color because of their (hyper)visibility in conversations about race and racism. As Shanice Brim writes, \u201cA lot of nonblack people feel that black issues take up too much space in the racism discussion.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe see it all the time in mainstream media\u2014from the Master of None bit in which Aziz Ansari\u2019s Dev Shah complained that \u201cpeople don\u2019t get that fired up about racist Asian or Indian stuff ... you only risk starting a brouhaha if you say something bad about black or gay people,\u201d to Salma Hayek\u2019s shutting down Jessica Williams\u2019 critique of anti-blackness in white feminism by interjecting with an account of her own experience as a (light-skinned) Latina in Hollywood.\n\nIt takes ignoring the singular, ongoing history of racial slavery and the violence of hypervisibility to pin the problems of nonblack people of color on black folks. But it happens again and again\u2014and not just in the world of Hollywood.\n\nFor years, \u201cgoing beyond black and white\u201d has been a catchphrase of nonblack Asian-American and Latinx advocates looking to spotlight their communities\u2019 unique struggles against white supremacy. But as critical race theorist Mari Matsuda has warned, anti-blackness often underlies the rhetoric of moving past the \u201cblack and white binary.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMatsuda explains: \u201cWhen we say we need to move beyond black and white, this is what a whole lot of people say or feel or think: \u2018Thank goodness we can get off that paradigm, because those black people made me feel so uncomfortable. ... Thank God I don\u2019t have to take those angry black people seriously anymore.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nThe myth of black privilege has real consequences, fracturing interracial coalitions and making black people the scapegoat for the violence white supremacy enacts on Latinx and Asian-American folks. Behind the thousands of Chinese-American protesters who declared that killer cop Peter Liang was a \u201csacrificial lamb\u201d to Black Lives Matter is the belief that, as one protester put it, \u201cwhite people [are] first-class, black people [are] second-class. ... Chinese [are] no class, or the last class.\u201d Likewise, beneath claims that a \u201cLatino Lives Matter\u201d movement is being stifled by \u201cblack and white\u201d conceptions of race is the twisted notion that black people are somehow responsible for a black-white binary that white people created to enforce their legal status as property.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s why in 2016, after nonblack people of color asked why Academy Award host Chris Rock wasn\u2019t mentioning Asian-American or Latinx underrepresentation, Mikki Kendall created the brilliant and incisive hashtag #NotYourMule to critique the expectation that black people will do the work for nonblack communities of color that often don\u2019t return the favor.\n\nWhile the hashtag is new, the sentiment isn\u2019t: It\u2019s a paraphrase from Zora Neale Hurston\u2019s 1937 novel, Their Eyes Were Watching God. And critiquing the demand for black activists to ally with nonblacks similarly has a long history.\n\nIn 1967, Kwame Ture and Charles V. Hamilton discredited the expectation that Black Power activists should align with \u201cgroups [that] accept the American system and want only\u2014if at all\u2014to make peripheral, marginal reforms in it.\u201d Addressing anti-blackness among nonblack people of color means confronting that same question: Do we want coalitions with black folks only until we can join white people as agents of anti-black and settler-colonial violence? Or do we seek, as Ture and Hamilton wrote, \u201cthe total revamping of society\u201d?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf we are to build meaningful coalitions with black activists, we don\u2019t have to start from scratch: There is a long tradition of interracial solidarity movements\u2014from the Chicano and Asian-American activists who stood with Black Panther Party members to free Huey Newton, to recent Black Lives Matter solidarity efforts in which nonblack POC have shut down federal buildings, confronted their family members and fought to hold nonblack POC police officers accountable for the murder of black people.\n\nThis ongoing history of solidarity teaches us that when we come together to honestly confront our unique but intertwined experiences of oppression, we can unlearn the capitalist belief that justice is a limited resource.\n\nBut when it comes to mainstream media representation, it\u2019s easy to feel like we are fighting for scraps. Too often, that leads to nonblack POC using anti-blackness to try to steal the spotlight\u2014like when a group of Asian Americans \u201cborrowed\u201d the #OscarsSoWhite tag for a panel at SXSW without inviting, or even consulting, its creator.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, though April Reign has every right to say that #OscarsSoWhite is indeed by and for black people alone, she has taken every opportunity to insist that Hollywood still needs to do better by nonblack Asian Americans and Latinx folks, declaring after last year\u2019s nominations saw an uptick in black nominees that \u201cthere\u2019s still a lot of work to be done.\u201d#OscarsSoBlackAndWhite is just another reminder that the labor and leadership of black women too often go unappreciated.\n\nUltimately, the demand for black people to build political coalitions with nonblack people of color is a demand for unreciprocated black labor. Our work to confront Asian-American and Latinx media underrepresentation\u2014and the countless violences our communities face outside of Hollywood\u2014is cut out for us. But let\u2019s be clear: It is our work.\n\n", "keywords": ["oscarssoblackandwhite", "myth", "white", "latinx", "hashtag", "asian", "black", "work", "say", "asianamerican", "nonblack", "color", "privilege"], "polarity": -0.021220289144817425, "subjectivity": 0.4139130523564483},

That means we have only roughly 1,400 days left in this presidency, with its penchant for frivolous executive orders, constant lies, maligning of the press and sharing way too many problematic tweets.\n\nIt\u2019s OK. I know. I\u2019m rocking back and forth wailing, too.\n\nBut on a serious note, my days have become almost predictable in their monotonous incredulity and outrage. I get up early, start cranking out news articles, and inevitably, some crazy story about the president\u2019s (or his Cabinet\u2019s) faux pas du jour or executive order du jour hits the news cycle. I laugh or curse (maybe both) with my teammates. I bite my nails in a bad habit fueled by anxiety as I catch up on everything that\u2019s actually going on in the White House. I eye the clock, doing that annoying tick thing I do with my leg, desperately waiting for my \u201cme time.\u201d\n\nAnd then I can escape.\n\nYoga (I practice mainly power yoga) has been my choice of self-care lately. I\u2019m a self-described yogi, so it\u2019s generally important for me to get on my mat regularly, but lately I\u2019ve found myself running toward my mat daily, particularly on a stressful news day.\n\nThere\u2019s really just something about being able to escape social media and the news, turn off my phone for at least the next hour, unroll my mat at the studio, sink back into child\u2019s pose and take a continuous series of solid breaths.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI originally came to yoga because of my job. I love what I do, bringing news to our community, but black news can be a bit of a strain on your person, as I\u2019m sure any black person can relate to. When you spend day after day writing up (or reading) stories about black people being brutalized, abused, bullied, made to feel othered ... it takes its toll.\n\nAnd, so, I turned to yoga looking for relief, looking for that self-care that I\u2019ve seen so many others revel in when talking about the ancient practice. And personally, for me, a whole new world opened.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne thing turned to another, and I soon found myself in teacher training (ya girl is a registered yoga teacher now!) and studying the Bhagavad Gita, the Yoga Sutras and other texts in my free time. My now-pretty-much-daily time on the mat (usually in the evening) is a signal that the workday is officially over and I am free to shed whatever mental weight may have accumulated throughout the day.\n\nI joke all the time that yoga is the only thing saving me from a breakdown (or from strangling someone), but a lot of truth is said in jest.\n\nOn my mat, I am reminded to be present. On my mat, I feel connected. On my mat, I\u2019m too focused on trying not to die as we go through more chaturangas (high-to-low-planks) than humanly possible to focus on anything else. On my mat, all thoughts of politics, news and Trump fades away. My brain slows down; there\u2019s nothing to look forward to and nothing to look back on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, at least until I walk out of the studio and look at my phone, only to see a breaking-news alert neatly deposited in my email inbox.\n\nBut at least I return to reality calmer, more grounded, more mindful, and more than ready to take on the next challenge in the media space. Yoga is just that thing that gives me a clean slate from which to work, a sort of mental clarity and dedication that I\u2019ve rarely experienced before. It makes me a better human being, I think.\n\nBut it\u2019s definitely not the only way of going around taking care of yourself during these troubled times. I know a lot of people (co-worker and perpetual hater Stephen Crockett, for example) who would rather have someone operate on them without anesthesia than step into a heated-yoga class, so I\u2019m curious: What have y\u2019all been doing to stay loved up during this presidency?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nMaybe you find solace at the gym? Whipping up new creations in the kitchen? Working on your car or bike? Have you turned to shopping? Perhaps you\u2019ve been going to a few more happy hours than you used to? (Though I don\u2019t recommend the alcohol approach if you hope to have a liver in January 2021 ... especially with that atrocity of a proposed health care bill going around.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMe?

Oprah undoubtedly is a legend, great orator and motivator, and billionaire, and essentially \u201cqualified\u201d to be president.\n\n\n\nNow she has gone on record to say that she doesn\u2019t plan on running for president. However, this continued desire to have another black face in the White House is something our community needs to reassess as we move closer to the midterm elections and the impending tokenization of the black vote.\n\n\n\nTo be clear: This country is not ready for, nor does it deserve, another black president.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the history. We have had one black president, and for all intents and purposes, Barack Obama did a decent job upholding the standards of the Oval Office. The problem is that these standards are oftentimes rooted in anti-blackness, and no matter the color of the person who adheres to those standards, he or she will inherently continue to hurt black and brown people, both domestic and global. Behind Obama\u2019s charismatic charm, bright smile and Al Green vocals was a man in a position of power that required him to do some very inhumane things.\n\n\n\nYet we are still eager to throw another black face into the White House because colonization has conditioned us to believe in symbolism as an ideology of progress, rather than realize that tokenism of black people within white systems has only been used as a litmus test for what is an acceptable standard of blackness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe protection of Obama\u2019s legacy by the black community has already begun, with an attempt to turn a blind eye to the wrongdoings, which is eerily similar to the reverent school lessons about America\u2019s forefathers, despite their complicity in slavery and racism. We can\u2019t allow an omission of the facts simply because Obama is black.\n\nIn addition to the good, Obama will be remembered for the thousands killed in drone strikes he ordered and the largest deportation of undocumented immigrants by any president in our history. Again, this is part of the job of running a white, imperialist nation. Yet we are still eager to throw another black face into the White House because colonization has conditioned us to believe in symbolism as an ideology of progress, rather than realize that tokenism of black people within white systems has only been used as a litmus test for what is an acceptable standard of blackness.\n\n\n\nHari Ziyad touches on this idea in his piece, \u201cWhy I Don\u2019t Want Another Black President,\u201d when he states: \u201cBut while giving black folks the fleeting empowerment of representation, Barack Obama did very little to challenge white society\u2014at least much less than he did to support it. His final acts as president, for example, will not be to pardon black freedom fighters-turned-political prisoners and fugitives like Nehanda Abiodun, but to ensure the smooth transition of power to his virulently anti-black successor.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe fail ourselves every time we place the burden of our freedom in elected officials\u2014especially those who are black and required to serve the white majority. Once in office, they continue to enforce laws that are inherently anti-black, which is in direct conflict with why many of us voted for them in the first place.\n\nOur failure is that we continue to try to work within a system that was created without the intention of ensuring equity or equality among races. Hundreds of years of evidence to the contrary, we continue to place our hopes in those like Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), who will eventually succumb to the pressures of the system that uses them as pawns of \u201cprogress\u201d to dehumanize those who aren\u2019t able or willing to assimilate into whiteness as they have.\n\n\n\nThe two-party system from which they operate has never served black communities well. Having the option of Democrat or Republican is often about choosing the lesser of two evils, despite the color of the person running for office. The pandering for our vote over the last 50 years has given us nothing but empty promises, mass incarceration, health care discrimination and a median family wealth that could drop to zero for African Americans in 2053.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite all of this, hope is not lost for those willing to invest in politics when it really matters. That means, as black folks, we can\u2019t wait every four years to be interested in what is going on in our country. We also shouldn\u2019t be waiting every two years for the midterm elections to get involved.\n\nFirst we must begin supporting local grassroots organizations that are on the ground attempting to make changes that will have national implication, while also divesting from systems of oppression in an effort to dismantle them; we need to begin anew with systems not built on anti-blackness.\n\nBlack folks have to become more than the swing vote that decides which evil gets to run the white imperialist empire.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis country is not built for, nor does it deserve to have, a black man, woman or gender-nonconforming person as president. Nearly 400 years of history have taught us that this system will not bring about freedom.\n\nThe time is now that we demand a change, starting with ourselves and how we do politics.

It is impossible to comprehend the far-reaching effects of the all-American tradition of racism without a holistic examination.\n\n\n\nOr you can just look at what happened this week.\n\nA Trump nominee has no idea if racial bias exists in the justice system.\n\nDuring his Wednesday Senate confirmation hearings, Michael Brennan, a white lawyer who has been nominated to the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, repeatedly dodged questions from Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) about racial bias in the justice system.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDo you think implicit racial bias exists in our criminal-justice system?\u201d Booker asked the Wisconsin lawyer.\n\n\u201cI would indicate only that I would do my very best as a judge to ensure that no biases came in,\u201d Brennan replied caucasianally. Booker asked him again:\n\nYou\u2019re aware that African Americans are stopped more than whites for drug searches in this country? That there\u2019s no difference between blacks and whites for using drugs or dealing drugs, but [blacks] are 3.7 times more likely to be arrested for it? You\u2019re aware of the data, I imagine, that says African Americans are more likely to get mandatory minimum sentences for the same crime? You\u2019re probably aware of the data that African Americans are more likely to serve more time for similar crimes ... You\u2019re a judge in the United States of America and you have not looked at issues of race in sentencing and the criminal-justice system? I find this astonishing.\n\nIf confirmed, Brennan would have a lifetime appointment to a court that has heard cases concerning sanctuary cities, voting rights, police brutality and the deportation of immigrants in this month alone. Brennan also served as a trial judge on a Milwaukee circuit court for nine years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA recent study shows bias in the criminal-justice system at every level. The study collected years of data on convictions, arrests, pleas and sentencing from\u2014you guessed it\u2014Wisconsin.\n\nWhite extremists kill more cops, but the FBI tracks black groups more closely.\n\nSince 1990, white supremacists and far-right extremists have killed 50 law-enforcement officers in the U.S., according to a recent report by the Anti-Defamation League. The report notes that left-wing groups, including \u201cblack identity extremists,\u201d have killed 11 officers during that period.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet the FBI issued an August 2017 report entitled, \u201cBlack Identity Extremists Likely Motivated to Target Law Enforcement Officers\u201d (pdf), warning 18,000 local and state agencies around the country of the threat posed by black groups. It has not issued an equivalent report for the far more dangerous right-wing groups, but, to be fair, the FBI doesn\u2019t have an equivalent designation for white identity extremists.\n\n\u201cThis document essentially says we don\u2019t care about your ideology, we care about your black identity,\u201d Michael German, a former FBI agent who worked in the counterterrorism division, told the Miami Herald. \u201cIt\u2019s an enormous classification that could encompass any violence by a black person.\u201d\n\nAlthough the FBI says it does not monitor groups based on speech, German notes that the threshold for surveillance is so low that the agency\u2019s report can be used to justify watching black organizations and monitoring black protests more closely.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCorrections officers exchanged racist messages while the Sheriff\u2019s Office stayed silent.\n\nA sergeant at the Santa Clara County, Calif., Sheriff\u2019s Office is waiting for an arbitrator to decide whether he should have been removed from his job for not reporting racist texts and emails from corrections officers in the county jail.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the Mercury News, Don Morrissey worked at the facility and did nothing to stop a group of about eight officers and one deputy from exchanging messages that included calling Jews \u201ckikes\u201d and black people \u201cniggers\u201d and \u201cyard apes.\u201d In one text, an officer said, \u201cWe could hang a nigger in Haiti for about 75 bucks tops.\u201d Another officer texted, \u201cCops have already killed 550 people in 2015,\u201d to which another responded, \u201cIf they\u2019re black, it doesn\u2019t count.\u201d\n\nThe case is significant because the officer never sent any of the racial epithets (although he joined in on the conversations), but tolerated a racist environment. Morrissey argues that many of the texts were sent while the officers were not on duty. He added that\u2014even though he knew about the texts\u2014he should not be responsible for the conduct of others, which is a valid point, except for one thing:\n\nMorrissey is president of the Deputy Sheriffs\u2019 Association of Santa Clara County!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is how institutional racism works. It is not about crosses on lawns or marches in Charlottesville, Va. However despicable those things might seem, they are far less impactful than the subtle tyranny of unseen bias.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be black in America is to walk a minefield of white supremacy, never knowing where racism might explode and rip you apart. It is buried in at least one teacher in every school. It sits behind the benches of courtrooms across the country. It is in chambered in the guns and hearts of police officers everywhere.\n\nInstitutional racism is not a problem that can be cured with a \u201cconversation about race.\u201d It is an American contagion for which there is no cure\u2014an unseen microscopic virus that infects white people and kills black people.\n\nIt is not being called a \u201cnigger.\u201d\n\nIt is the everlasting, invisible scourge of being treated like one.", "keywords": ["white", "report", "fbi", "week", "black", "know", "racial", "racism", "groups", "system", "happened", "officers", "likely", "institutional", "need"], "polarity": 0.05744444444444439, "subjectivity": 0.39675555555555553},

Collins III, a Bowie State University student killed hours before his graduation by Sean Urbanski, and the fatal stabbing of two people by Jeremy Christian during a racist rant aboard a Portland train.\n\nDespite the hype of conservatives around the country, many of last year\u2019s nominees failed miserably. Black Lives Matter, a group that many whites want so badly to be considered a terrorist organization, failed to kill a single individual in 2017, as it has during every year of its existence. Antifa, which President Donald Trump condemned as one of the groups in Charlottesville, Va., that had very bad people \u201con both sides,\u201d did not cause a death last year. More tragically, the Anti-Defamation League could not find anyone who died or was even critically injured by a professional football player who kneeled during the national anthem.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be fair, the ADL did find two incidents of extremism by the mythical \u201cblack supremacist\u201d movement. In April, Kori Muhammad went on a shooting spree in Fresno, Calif. Muhammad\u2019s father said that he was trying to start a war between black and whites.

I absolutely get that jobs are scarce and nice checks for those who truly \u201cstarted from the bottom, now we\u2019re here\u201d are extremely rare. But sometimes, wanting to stay out of the unemployment line can go too far. Just think about how many people you know who have checked out at their jobs because it\u2019s just easier to go along to get along.\n\n\n\nSo when I attended the Atlanta Hawks\u2019 diversity-inclusion symposium, MOSAIC (Model of Shaping Atlanta Through Inclusive Conversations), last week, I really expected Hill to continue walking the \u201cjust trying to keep my job\u201d tone of her statement. In my experience, many companies do these events just to look like they\u2019re doing something. Rarely are real issues even touched. The conversation usually reinforces what companies want to hear and not what employees of color\u2014black employees especially\u2014really experience, which is everything but diverse and inclusive. Plus, given MOSAIC\u2019s origins, I just didn\u2019t expect to hear anything out of the norm.\n\n\n\nMOSAIC, which you\u2019ve probably never heard of before now, is one of the initiatives the Atlanta Hawks created in response to their own racist mini scandal back in 2014, when racially disparaging comments from Danny Ferry\u2014the former Duke standout (enough said)\u2014and emails from then-Hawks co-owner Bruce Levenson surfaced. Ferry\u2019s comments centered on NBA forward Luol Deng\u2019s African heritage, while Levenson\u2019s emails basically argued that Hawks fans were too black and \u201cthat the black crowd scared away the whites and there are simply not enough affluent black fans to build a sign[i]ficant season ticket base.\u201d\n\n\n\nToday there\u2019s a new ownership group with former Duke and NBA player Grant Hill as a partner. Plus they hired Nzinga \u201cZing\u201d Shaw, as the NBA\u2019s first-ever chief diversity and inclusion officer. They\u2019ve also put on MOSAIC annually since 2016, and for this third year they tapped Hill to give the keynote address with \u201cDisruption\u201d as its theme.\n\nKicking off her address, Hill joked about spending time in Belize and zip-lining for the first time before easing into the White House calling her \u201cDonald Trump is a white supremacist\u201d tweet \u201ca fireable offense\u201d during a press briefing, backed by the man himself on Twitter, of course.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd in case there is anyone who thinks that no one is still riding for Trump, Hill made it clear that they are by sharing details of the snail mail of hate she received along with the social media abuse. \u201cI got called the n-word so much that I thought it was my middle name,\u201d she candidly revealed.\n\n\n\nAll of this happened as Hill was still warming her seat at ESPN\u2019s iconic SportsCenter, dubbed SC6 when she and her longtime co-host, Michael Smith, from the successful His & Hers show, took over in February 2017. ESPN didn\u2019t fire Hill or suspend her for those Trump tweets; rather, the sports network suspended her for another series of tweets in October 2017 that alluded to boycotting Dallas Cowboys advertisers in response to team owner Jerry Jones\u2019 promise to bench players who \u201cdisrespect the flag.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn Atlanta, Hill reiterated that the suspension was justified, noting that \u201cESPN is in the business of sports\u201d and \u201cnot in the business necessarily of being construed as a political organization and I put them firmly in those crosshairs.\u201d She also insisted that it was her decision to leave SC6 and join ESPN microsite The Undefeated to resume her writing career, with hosting TV specials and even creating her own video content as part of the deal.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI never intended to be a disruptor,\u201d she told the crowd. \u201cI never intended to be thrust into a role of activism,\u201d she added, noting that \u201cI didn\u2019t choose the moment; the moment chose me.\u201d\n\nMy worst fears about Hill giving up the fight like so many others whose outspokenness resulted in hard consequences seemed confirmed until she switched it up. As she took on the topics of disruption, diversity and inclusion, she spoke directly to those in hiring positions, who are still overwhelmingly white and male, informing them that people of color and women are experiencing this new old America in ways they can\u2019t even begin to imagine.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn whatever business that you\u2019re in, especially if you\u2019re a woman and you\u2019re a person of color, there\u2019s a level of vulnerability that you feel right now that may be hard for everybody to relate to. You feel a little scared and under attack right now under some of the current policies and tone that our country has taken,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGetting even more real, Hill confessed that, in the current Trump climate and after Charlottesville, Va., especially, there were days she didn\u2019t even want to come to work. \u201cFor the first time in my career,\u201d she admitted, \u201cit kind of put my dual role of person and journalist in conflict with one another.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI never intended to be a disruptor. I never intended to be thrust into a role of activism. I didn\u2019t choose the moment; the moment chose me.\u201d\n\nShe also let those in power know that the solution to diversity and inclusion issues didn\u2019t rest with those of us who didn\u2019t create the problem in the first place, and that hiring some of us was only the first step. \u201cGetting through the door is just one of the problems that needs to be addressed,\u201d she explained. \u201cWe all know there are definitely structures that need to change from a tangible standpoint. We need more women, we need more people of color, you need more LGBTQ people. We know that, but once they make it through the door, then what happens?\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSugarcoating was not on the menu as Hill shared that, in her 20-year career, she knew what it meant to just be a quota. \u201cI\u2019ve had the experience of being wanted for what I represent but not really wanted for what I represent,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what I mean about the difference about once you\u2019re actually through that door.\u201d She added:\n\n\n\nBecause you can talk a lot about wanting us at the table, but will you listen to us once we\u2019re actually in the room? Will you groom and mentor us the way you would somebody that looks like you? Will you invite us to come play golf? Will you invite us out to drinks so that we can network with key people? Will you recommend us for assignments that challenge and grow us? Will you promote us? Fast-track us? Treat us like franchise players and not just sixth men or sixth women that are on the bench? Will you give us credit when we deserve it, even it means that you get a little less credit?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrue diversity and inclusion gets uncomfortable, she said, and companies need to be clear about whether they really want to deal with that:\n\nWhen you start disrupting what your organization looks like, when it starts changing, and it\u2019s very emblematic of what\u2019s happening in this country right now, when the progressiveness gets a little too fast for people, a little too uncomfortable, when they start thinking that someone else\u2019s ascension or having different people in the room is going to mean less for them, then you get the blowback, then you get the brushback, and then you get the criticism, and then you get people who are angry and mad at you, and you have to make that decision in that moment: Am I here to support the people who are mad over really nothing, or am I here to support the people who have never gotten this opportunity or rarely get it?\n\nThe answer to the second half of that question, she said, has largely been a resounding \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou find in a lot of places\u2014they\u2019re more concerned about the people who are mad as opposed to the people they need to welcome,\u201d she explained. \u201cAnd so, if you\u2019re in charge and you\u2019re a thought leader, you have to really be honest with yourself about what you have the stomach to do, especially in tumultuous times.\u201d\n\n\n\nOne of my colleagues, who has seen Hill speak since this whole \u201cTrump is a white supremacist\u201d water-is-wet nonscandal, chastised me for even doubting the \u201cDetroit vs. Everybody\u201d native.

He who accepts evil without protesting against it is really cooperating with it.\u201d \u2014Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nThis weekend and Monday, America will celebrate the legacy of the civil rights revolutionary Martin Luther King Jr. Whenever any black person utters words that make white people adjust their collars, white people unfailingly respond with a variation of the phrase \u201cbut not all white people.\u201d If they are bold enough, they might even challenge you with the Super Saiyan Caucasian preamble of all preambles: \u201cWhat would Martin Luther King say about ... \u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, on this particular issue, we know what King would have said because he already said it.\n\nIn 1964, after he won the Nobel Peace Prize, most of white Atlanta didn\u2019t acknowledge it. The city where he was born and where he lived didn\u2019t even try to honor King until Robert Woodruff, president of Coca-Cola, decided to sponsor a banquet. He still couldn\u2019t get the white elite to attend until the New York Times wrote a scathing article about the efforts to undermine the event and Coca-Cola threatened to leave the city.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the tickets sold out, many people assumed that King would take it easy on the powerful people who had reluctantly gathered to honor him. When he gave his speech, he spoke directly to the powerful men who had remained quiet during the brutality of the civil rights movement:\n\nHistory will have to record that the greatest tragedy of this period of social transition was not the strident clamor of the bad people, but the appalling silence of the good people.\n\nMartin Luther King Jr. was wrong, though.\n\nHistory has yet to record the tragedy of the people who sat silently in the room on Thursday when Trump besmirched the nation of Haiti and other black and brown countries. History still has not listed the names in the room when he said that Haitians \u201call have AIDS\u201d and Nigerians live in huts. Their names are nowhere to be found alongside the list of neo-Nazis and Klansmen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot only was King incorrect when he assured us of history\u2019s note-taking, but he was doubly wrong when he described the people who remained appallingly silent as \u201cgood people.\u201d Sidestepping evil for the sake of political favor or not upsetting the apple cart is the opposite of \u201cgood.\u201d These people are co-conspirators. They are accomplices. They are guilty of aiding and abetting by providing material support to white supremacy.\n\nNot only are they at fault, but they join a long list of those complicit with Trump\u2019s brand of racism. Their names should appear alongside those of the pearl-clutching congregation of reporters, celebrities and generic-label white people distancing themselves from \u201cthe Donald\u201d as they pretend to just realize that he has racist tendencies.\n\nThey should register with the 53 percent of white women who voted for a robeless Klansman, along with the lawmakers who embrace him and his policies. The names of kowtowing Negroes like Steve Harvey, Ray Lewis, Stephen A. Smith, Omarosa Manigault Newman and Chrisette Michele, who implored us to respect a man who would shit down our throats for the spectacle of it, should be etched into those history books, too. They all worked on the road crew that paved the way for a white supremacist to gain respect and power. They paid for the fuel in his car.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is why I am never ashamed to say that I voted for someone just because he or she is black. This is why \u201cdiversity\u201d can never be a bad word. If we are not seated at the table, not only are our voices unheard, but the evil ones are emboldened. This is why \u201cnot all white people\u201d rings hollow in my ears. All the white people in the room at both events stayed silent. Silence is racism. Racism is evil.\n\nThose same silent voices omitted from history will probably participate in the praising of Martin Luther King Jr. this weekend. They will talk about freedom and equality for all people. They will do it loudly and publicly because they know that they will always have the opportunity to slit our throats behind closed doors without a single objection.\n\nOur only hope remains in the unseen recompense of the invisible, omnipotent God who King believed would avenge the sins of these evil men. He told us: \u201cThe hottest place in hell is reserved for those who remain neutral in times of great moral conflict.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI guess we\u2019ll have to wait for that.\n\nI just hope they don\u2019t run out of room.", "keywords": ["white", "evil", "king", "silence", "names", "trumps", "say", "luther", "racism", "jr", "men", "martin", "shithole", "room", "silent"], "polarity": -0.049145809490637064, "subjectivity": 0.4577242042759285},

Six people have held the job since 2009, counting those who served as consultants or held the role on an interim basis.\n\nThat \u201cis a clear indicator that the organization\u2019s challenges are not [those] of one person in the executive director position, or national office staff, but its governing body \u2014 the board of directors and the overall system of governance and culture the board oversees, implements and operates within,\u201d Toomer wrote.\n\n\u201cSince I have been in this position, I have witnessed and observed conduct toward staff, members and even fellow board members that are disruptive, destructive and a disservice to the mission, necessity and value of this nonprofit organization. For example, a board and its leadership that [are] prone to undermining tactics and backbiting, which creates an environment where a lack of trust is pervasive, effectively compromising systems and infrastructure integrity throughout all organizational operations.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt another point, Toomer wrote, \u201cRegrettably, there is not even one board member who I would address to take this matter toward substantive fixing. It is my assessment, based on firsthand experience and observation, that the board is not self-aware enough to recognize its own flaws or its contribution to perpetuating a profoundly troubled culture. Or, as bad, the board may recognize the cultural deficiency and not think it is an albatross around progress, or they are either intimidated by an individual board member\u2019s authority and don\u2019t want to poke that authority for fear of retaliation in whatever form it takes. . . .\u201d\n\nNABJ announced last September that it had hired Toomer, \u201can accomplished media executive and nonprofit leader,\u201d after an extensive national search that Toomer\u2019s letter said cost NABJ $40,000.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe are excited that Sharon will be joining us at this critical time in NABJ\u2019s history,\u201d NABJ President Sarah J. Glover said in NABJ\u2019s news release.\n\n\n\n\u201cHer combined fundraising, organizational, executive management, journalism, and public affairs experience and skills make her a dominant force. Sharon is experienced, visionary and passionate. We feel confident that she will serve us well in the implementation of NABJ\u2019s strategic plan and be an impactful leader that shapes the national office as NABJ continues to grow and evolve.\n\n\u201cNABJ is so very fortunate to have Sharon onboard.\u201d\n\nHowever, Toomer portrayed Glover, a social media editor for NBC-owned stations, as part of the problem. Glover is the first NABJ president to serve a second term, due to a change in NABJ\u2019s constitution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOne of my first observations as executive director was the disregard and abuse of national office staff,\u201d Toomer wrote. \u201cIn fact, at my first introduction to national office staff, the board president berated staff in my presence for not making sure she was taken care of at her reception in New Orleans (at the 2017 convention.) It was a dehumanizing spectacle, and a show of abuse of power.\u201d\n\nFurther, \u201cthe board, without my input and despite several requests to review the document before it was finalized, implemented significant changes (reductions) in employee benefits . . . \u201c\n\nBefore she arrived, Toomer added, the board decided to end its relationship with JoAnne Lyons Wooten, a former executive director who had been serving as development director, \u201cleaving a four-month vacancy in a critical coverage area of operations, especially as it relates to fundraising around the annual convention \u2014 our signature program, which generates the majority of NABJ\u2019s revenue. . . .\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI was not afforded the opportunity to evaluate Lyons-Wooten . . . I have learned there was no basis for ending Lyons-Wooten\u2019s tenure. The decision to do so has severely weakened our operations. . . .\u201d\n\nIn perhaps NABJ\u2019s most unpopular move under its current board, the association in January turned down a $250,000 scholarship grant from Facebook to award students over the course of five years. The National Association of Hispanic Journalists, Native American Journalists Association, Asian American Journalists Association and National Lesbian & Gay Journalists Association accepted the money.\n\nNABJ agreed in February to follow suit, but the episode demonstrated \u201c[p]erhaps one of the most egregious examples of the board undermining my role/leadership as executive director,\u201d Toomer wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe board [perpetuated] a false narrative regarding how we came to an initial decision. Several board members and NABJ members have indicated that the perception is that I alone made the decision to decline to accept Facebook\u2019s $250,000 grant because they would not agree to a reasonable 20 percent administration fee. The board president could, but has not, clarified that she, in fact, on December 20, 2017 gave me the authority to decline the grant based on the administration fee not being included. . . .\u201d\n\nToomer also accused other board members of unprofessional conduct. \u201cCertain influential executive board committee members poison the well by instigating . . . discord in emails, text, online chats and by phone; mocking a former board member by circulating a compromising image; and engaging in bullying, scapegoating, plotting and gossip that is not only damaging to NABJ\u2019s reputation, but also embarrassing and shameful overall. . . .\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe attitude behind such actions affects the organization\u2019s bottom line, Toomer said. \u201cThough the organization has worked through its financial challenges, I have learned in my interactions with funding partners NABJ\u2019s reputation has taken a hit. Questions of relevance and diminished return on investment are the feedback I have heard from our sponsors. A sense of \u2018entitlement\u2019 and \u2018arrogance\u2019 are the choice words I have also heard to characterize NABJ.\u201d\n\nThe missive from Toomer was not intended as an evaluation of Glover\u2019s presidency, which NABJ provided in an October release announcing her reelection.\n\n\u201cTouting zero-based budgeting, Glover said her first two years as president were spent erasing a two-year, six-figure deficit and providing accountability, while also laying the groundwork for innovative and industry-challenging programming. Both NABJ conventions in 2016 and 2017 set attendance records for the association.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cGlover founded the NABJ Black Male Media Project, which launched nationwide thanks to the dynamic activation and collaboration of 21 NABJ chapters, all of whom hosted concurrent programming on June 10, 2017. Other notable accomplishments in her first term include: development and implementation of the NABJ Strategic Plan 2017-2020; eradicated deficit spending; led the board in its quest to expand NABJ investments with a $500,000 allocation; and co-founded the Poynter-NABJ Digital Leadership Academy. Her primary goals for her second term are to obtain a seven-figure, multi-year grant for NABJ, develop a new website and mobile app, expand the national office staff, further results-driven media advocacy and create a multifunctional jobs program. . . .\u201d\n\nAsked to respond to Toomer\u2019s letter, Glover said by email Saturday, \u201cThis is a personnel matter and should be honored and respected as such.\u201d The issue was said to have dominated a board conference call.\n\nThe board is scheduled to meet next weekend in Detroit, site of its Aug. 1-5 convention.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToomer\u2019s letter concluded, \u201cAs uncomfortable as this is to write and perhaps, for recipients to read, I wholeheartedly believe this is an opportunity to turn around this organization by doing the essential internal work required to be who and what we say we want to be.\n\n\u201cLed by an objective facilitator, it is my strongest professional recommendation to to he board, founders and partners [to] come to the table to chart a course of action that will be to the ultimate benefit of NABJ, its stakeholders and its mission. . . .\u201d\n\nMemphis Paper Going Deeper in Reporting on Itself\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s last speech,\u201d David Beard wrote Wednesday for the Poynter Institute. \u201cIt was perhaps the greatest speech ever given in Memphis. \u2018I have been to the mountaintop,\u2019 thundered the civil rights leader, just a day before his assassination.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe reporter from the local Commercial Appeal newspaper on April 3, 1968, didn\u2019t write those words. Noted instead on the skimpy, un-bylined story on page 11: the \u2018disappointingly small crowd.\u2019\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTwo years before the National Geographic opened its archives to a historian and broadcast its findings \u2014 of an appalling legacy of racist coverage and characterization \u2014 the Memphis paper did its own look back on 175 years of history. This Sunday, the Memphis paper is going deeper on its spotty record of covering civil rights in the 1960s, says Mark Russell, the paper\u2019s executive editor. [Story, \u201cMemphis sanitation strike met with hostility, misunderstanding from media\u201d]\n\n\n\n\u201cRussell encourages other editors across America to show transparency, to dig into their old stories to examine their publications and broadcast stations\u2019 role in the past \u2014 and, frankly, to apologize for failings. The National Geographic puts it this way: \u2018To rise above our past, we must acknowledge it.\u2019\n\n\u201c \u2018We need to tell our story,\u2019 says Russell, the former Orlando Sentinel editor and the first African-American to lead the Memphis paper. \u2018The power is that we tell people what we were and what we\u2019ve become. But be unsparing in telling people what you were, don\u2019t sugarcoat it, because that won\u2019t work.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEven with the benefit of hindsight, Russell cannot fathom why his paper and its departed cousin, the afternoon Press-Scimitar, did not put the speech by the Nobel Peace Prize-winning King on Page One. He can\u2019t speak to why his 1960s editing predecessors consistently refused coverage to Memphis minister James Lawson, the veteran civil rights leader who invited King to help the city\u2019s striking sanitation workers. . . .\u201d\n\nGeographic\u2019s Race Problems: Omission, Mindset\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn its special \u201cRace Issue,\u201d due out in print on March 27, National Geographic Editor-in-Chief Susan Goldberg acknowledges the magazine\u2019s racist past, but the real problems were of omission and, as throughout the U.S. media, lack of diversity and the requirement \u201cto embrace the culture of white supremacy,\u201d according to the Geographic\u2019s first black staff writer.\n\n\n\nCharles E. Cobb Jr. is a former field secretary for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, co-founder of the National Association of Black Journalists and author of the 2014 book, \u201cThis Nonviolent Stuff\u2019ll Get You Killed: How Guns Made the Civil Rights Movement Possible.\u201d\n\n\n\nCobb wrote this assessment for Journal-isms:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFirst let me say that I have not yet seen the April National Geographic issue on race.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut let me note here, however, that I was that magazine\u2019s first Black staff writer and was there for twelve years (1985-97); seventeen counting the freelance years which for me began with the magazine in 1980.\u201dI was not contacted by anyone associated with putting out this issue. Strange, and I think journalistically sloppy. Minimally, the question of whether nonwhite writers and photographers were ever on staff should have been raised by someone in preparing this issue. Even now, I remain the only Black staff writer National Geographic has ever employed. Make of that what you will. [Debra Adams Simmons, who is African American, began in July as executive editor, culture.]\n\n\u201cAnyway, without question the Geographic\u2019s roots in colonialism and imperialism cannot be denied; and white supremacist images and words infected the magazine for decades. But unlike, say, the Washington Post, which was also blatantly racist for decades, the Geographic struck a particular tone, manifesting an almost romantic fascination with the exotic. It certainly believed that \u2018civilization\u2019 was the product of the so-called superior western mind but did not feel that this attitude contradicted \u2018exploration\u2019 of, and even affection for, what they considered a largely primitive but exotic non-European world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn any case I think it is a waste of time and thought to dwell much on this. It is a bit too easy to say, \u2018We\u2019re not like that now.\u2019 Greatly needed though is a larger discussion about how white supremacy has functioned in this country, especially in media, and the depth of the white supremacist sensibility. We do not have space for that here.\n\n\u201cAlthough 21st Century Fox now owns the Geographic, I think my experience there still has some relevance. Writing for the magazine I did not find racist images and text to be as big a problem as omission. The most difficult stories to persuade the magazine to take on were stories about Africa that were not natural science stories. One exception, however: Egypt, always popular with the magazine\u2019s readers.\n\n\u201cThe Geographic finally did a story about Black America \u2014 Harlem, in 1977, written by Frank Hercules and photographed by Leroy Woodson, both Black, both freelancers. But stories about Black America were the toughest sell of all although I did manage to have published a story about the blues that was very popular. Ironically I kind of backed into doing that story. I initially proposed a story about Louis Armstrong who had just passed away. No interest. Then jazz. No interest. I think a blues story conjured exotic Negroes in the minds of the editorial decision-makers. That was acceptable and they went for it.\u201dI once told the editor of the magazine while commenting on a Caribbean story that I did not much care for, that I was willing to be the \u2018Black Writer\u2019 at the magazine. He replied he did not want me \u2018just\u2019 doing that and sent me off to Paris.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cLet me say this as a kind of final word although I could go on for thousands of words: The problem of race at the Geographic is the same throughout U.S. media. Few Blacks in decision making positions and to rise through the ranks you have to embrace the culture of white supremacy. This problem is even worse for Latinos and Asians who are almost completely invisible at every level of media.\u201d\n\nSusan Goldberg with Brooke Gladstone, \u201cOn the Media,\u201d WNYC-FM: National Geographic Examines Its Racist Past (audio)\n\nMatt Philbin, NewsBusters.org: Slate Writer: NatGeo\u2019s \u2018Race Issue\u2019 Not Good Enough\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVictor Ray, Washington Post: National Geographic acknowledges its racist past, then steps on its message with a cover photo\n\nL.A.

His hands are in the air,\u201d Wesley Lowery wrote Tuesday for the Washington Post. \u201cThree Camden County, N.J., police officers approach from all sides with their weapons drawn. They\u2019d received an anonymous tip about a man with a gun.\n\n\n\n\u201cMinguela, who seemed to fit the description, is unarmed. The first officer to reach Minguela grabs him from behind and slams him to the ground. The officer then curls a fist and starts punching \u2014 landing a dozen rapid blows to Minguela\u2019s head as two other officers help pin the man to the ground.\n\n\n\n\u201cA surveillance camera mounted to a nearby liquor store captured the Feb. 22 beating frame by frame, the latest addition to a familiar genre stretching from Rodney King to Alton Sterling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cUnlike those other videos, you probably haven\u2019t seen this one.\n\n\u201cPolice violence \u2014 beatings, Taserings, killings \u2014 and criminal justice reform more broadly were arguably the leading domestic news storyline during the final two years of the Obama administration. The deaths of Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Sandra Bland, Philando Castile and others dominated headlines, inspired nationwide protests and brought on a pro-law-enforcement backlash that helped elect President Trump. Now the issue has all but vanished from the national political conversation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not because police violence has stopped. As of Thursday [March 8], 212 people had been shot and killed by American police officers so far this year, according to The Washington Post\u2019s police shooting database \u2014 about the same pace of three fatal shootings per day that The Post has recorded since we began tracking police shootings in 2015.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s not because reporters have abandoned police accountability: Recent months have seen intensive investigations from BuzzFeed, the Los Angeles Times, the Miami Herald, the Minneapolis Star Tribune, the Tampa Bay Times and the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, among others. Several Post reporters, myself included, spent 2017 investigating what happens to \u2018bad apple\u2019 police officers after they are fired. As it turns out, they often end up right back on the job.\n\n\u201cThe first of several reasons policing reform has lost our national attention is obvious: Trump. The election of a reality television host under a cloud of Russian interference \u2014 whose White House is plagued by scandals, constant turnover, policy reversals, leaks and staff infighting \u2014 is deservedly the drama at center stage. Cable news stations, the political press corps and social media networks have covered Trump above all else.

Prescott decision, The Root has decided to print the full decision as well as the minority opinion.\n\nStatement of Facts:\n\nOn July 4, 2016, at a family barbecue, Keisha Prescott was engaged in a spades match with her cousin James \u201cJ-Mac\u201d McDaniel. They were battling Keisha\u2019s aunt Margaret Parnell and her uncle Manuel Prescott (heretofore referred to by his more accepted moniker, \u201cMan Man.\u201d) Records show that \u201cAunt Margie\u201d is not a blood relative, but just a woman who lives across the street from Keisha\u2019s grandmother. (The court, however, allowed Parnell to ride with the \u201caunt\u201d designation because of the precedent set in the 1983 case of Aunt Wilma v. the State of Georgia)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Caucasian's Guide To Spades Whether it is played in the back of a college cafeteria, at a bachelor party, or during a Black\u2026 Read more Read\n\nThe contest, scheduled to end when one of the contestants reached a total of 350, was abruptly interrupted during the first hand. Holding the last card, after winning six of the seven books bid by her team, Keisha played the monochrome card with the word \u201cJoker\u201d emblazoned across the top. Man Man, in response, played the colorful version of the joker card and proceeded to rake the book (Rake\u2019em v. Take\u2019em; 1971), setting Keisha and James.\n\nA dispute emerged when both parties claimed to have won the book. Keisha noted that no one had stated which joker was the big joker, so she assumed hers was the bigger, because it had the word \u201cguarantee\u201d on it, while Man Man countered that his joker was obviously larger in size, meaning it was, by definition, the \u201cbig joker.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA lower-court decision by Uncle Lester declined to solve the debate when he ruled: \u201cMy name is Bennett, and I ain\u2019t in it.\u201d The group then appealed to the district court. That court\u2019s hearings were interrupted when the \u201cCha Cha\u201d Slide interrupted the proceedings, bringing the issue before this court.\n\nMajority Opinion:\n\nIt is the opinion of this court, by a 5-4 decision, that the black-and-white Joker is the supreme card in the game of spades.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the court recognizes that this opinion can be overridden by house rules, as stated in the 1953 decision, This Is My Damn House v. That Don\u2019t Make You Right, Luther, this specific case applies only in the rare instances that the big joker is not determined before the commencement of spades-related activities.\n\nThe majority of the bench agrees with Keisha\u2019s oral argument that \u201cif the biggest joker was always the big joker, there would be no need to mention it.\u201d Furthermore, the court found that Keisha\u2019s spades-playing abilities are impeccable.\n\nIn reviewing the score from the game in question, it was determined that Keisha had not overbid, even turning a \u201cpossible\u201d into a book when she led with a queen of hearts, holding the ace even though she only had two cards in said suit. The fact that she cut the king demonstrates a level of ability rarely seen by the bench.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause of this demonstrated ability, the court finds it highly unlikely that Keisha would have held her joker to be played last if she thought it was the little joker.\n\nMargie, on the other hand, was found to be deficient as an opponent and card player. She underbid by two books on this hand, and a subsequent investigation found her to have reneged on three previous occasions. Also, several witnesses testified, under penalty of perjury and not being allowed any more of Uncle Junior\u2019s ribs, that Margie referred to the clubs suit as \u201cpuppy toes\u201d more than once, indicating that she was a novice spades player at best.\n\nBecause Man-Man licked the card and affixed it to his forehead, we were able to order a DNA analysis. We discovered that\u2014although it is likely that he assumed his was the big joker\u2014Man Man\u2019s consumption of three Bud Lights and no less than three red Solo cups of brown liquor may have played a part in his lack of clarity in the matter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTherefore, based on the available evidence and Keisha\u2019s argument of \u201cNigga, what do you think \u2018Guarantee\u2019 means?\u201d We declare that the black-and-white joker\u2014despite the size of the drawing\u2014is definitely the big joker.\n\nDissenting Opinion\n\nIn this matter, we determined that Man Man and Margie\u2019s joker is the big joker based on one essential fact:\n\nIt. Is. Bigger.\n\nIf the card manufacturers had not intended for the card in question not to be identified as more important, would they have spent more time coloring it in? Furthermore, ignoring the size of the illustration belies the fact that it is, according to the laws of science, a bigger joker.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe also reject the premise that Man Man\u2019s seeming intoxication means his judgment may have been affected. In the 1964 case Johnson v. Everybody Else, the lower court\u2019s decision was overturned when the Supreme Court found that alcohol played no part in his renege accusations. Research shows that 82 percent of all spades games are played with one or more players under the influence of alcohol.\n\nThe court recognizes that a better decision could have been reached by replaying the hand. However, we recognize the house rules that being set in the first hand eliminates the opponents from contention.\n\nIt is the opinion of this court that, for reasons of clarity and by every metric of common sense, the big joker should be the bigger joker. We do, however, acknowledge the precedent of house rules.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur Ruling\n\nBy a 5-4 margin, the court rules in favor of the plaintiff.\n\nHowever, we also rule that J-Mac\u2019s slur that referred to his opponents as \u201ccheating motherfuckers\u201d no longer applies, as this was a legitimate dispute. As such, he must compensate Man Man with the fifth of Crown Royal that spilled when J-Mac knocked over the spades table.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe suggest that the person taking score write \u201cbig\u201d on the agreed-upon joker, and clarify whether or not the deuce of diamonds is a spade or not. (This ruling does not apply when playing \u201cace down\u201d or with a \u201ckitty.\u201d)\n\nIn conclusion, the court also reprimands both the plaintiffs and the defendants in that disputes of this sort will never be addressed by this judicial body without the appropriate future consideration:\n\nYou must bring us a plate.", "keywords": ["spades", "card", "black", "supreme", "court", "big", "ruling", "played", "v", "keisha", "man", "decision", "joker"], "polarity": 0.1113577097505669, "subjectivity": 0.4160997732426305},

A mix of pick-up trucks and sedans flying the Confederate Battle Flag began to trickle in. In a few minutes, the manager of the Walmart, flanked by multiple police officers, would ask them to leave. (\u201cIt\u2019s private property,\u201d he\u2019d say.) But at 10:30 am, a group of about 15 Dixie Freedom Riders were still huddled in a circle, puffing on cigarettes and preparing to drive a few miles north to Memphis, where they would protest what they considered the illegal removal of two Confederate monuments.\n\nLast month, the Memphis city council voted in favor of transferring ownership of two public parks to a recently formed non-profit organization called Greenspace, Inc, who bought them for $1,000 each. Within hours of the vote on December 20, the city had removed statues of Confederate president Jefferson Davis and Confederate general (and early Ku Klux Klan member) Nathan Bedford Forrest.\n\nIn the wake of the controversy, a Facebook group calling itself Confederate 901 put out a call for protesters to meet in Memphis on January 6. But after missing the city\u2019s deadline to apply for a protest permit, Confederate 901 decided instead to caravan through Memphis and display Confederate flags from their vehicles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping to bring the African-American community and the white community\u2014you know, all communities together as one,\u201d said Confederate supporter Renee Land as she waited in the Walmart parking lot Saturday morning. \u201cWe don\u2019t want our history removed. If you\u2019re going to remove that statue, then let\u2019s just go all over entire United States to remove every statue we have.\u201d\n\nBilly Sessions, a Confederate activist and an organizer of the Memphis protest, also disavowed any association with white nationalist groups.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe Confederacy, the history has been twisted on that, but we\u2019re all Southerners,\u201d Sessions said later. \u201cNo matter what color you are, we\u2019re all Southerners. It\u2019s not about racism. It might have been about racism hundreds of years ago when the slave ships come across the Atlantic, but it\u2019s not anymore. The white supremacists have hijacked the Confederate flag and it has been seen as a symbol of hate, but it never intentionally was.\u201d\n\n\n\nBilly Roper of The Shield Wall Network, who also showed up in Memphis that day, has a different view. Roper is a self-proclaimed white nationalist who the Southern Poverty Law Center describes as \u201cthe uncensored voice of violent neo-Nazism.\u201d Roper is known for his unabashed use of racist, anti-Semitic language and violent rhetoric, at times suggesting that genocide and eugenics should be considered as potential tools to create an all-white ethno-state within the borders of United States. \u201cEthnic cleansing is no new concept,\u201d he said during the Memphis protest. \u201cIt\u2019s always been human nature.\u201d\n\nThe way he saw it, the Shield Wall Network was here to nudge the Confederate activists in the right direction. \u201cMy job is to be as extreme as I can be legally,\u201d he said. \u201cMy radical flank works to make Confederate 901 more radical and extreme.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt one point during the day, Billy Roper and a group of about a dozen supporters managed to post up just outside of Health Sciences Park, formerly known as Forrest Park. Once there, they unfurled a banner: \u201cDiversity = White Genocide.\u201d\n\n\n\nBy 10 am on Saturday, it was clear that the City of Memphis had no intention of turning this protest into another Charlottesville. A quarter-mile perimeter was established around the park with various checkpoints that included metal detectors and an extensive police presence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe violence some community members feared never materialized as counter-protesters from Take \u2018Em Down 901, the NAACP, and other city and civic leaders urged residents not to engage, instead calling for a day of community service.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTami Sawyer, founder of Take \u2018Em Down 901 and political planning chair of the Memphis Branch of the NAACP, posted a message to Facebook on Friday evening: \u201cWhile some will choose to ride around and gather in the name of hatred and white supremacy, we are calling for all Memphis to \u2018show up!\u2019 But don\u2019t show up by protesting, counter protesters. Show up by taking this opportunity to show the world that we work together to serve our community.\u201d\n\nBy Saturday morning the hashtag #SHOWUPMEMPHIS began to circulate on social media. Sawyer said she drew inspiration from the efforts of Take \u2018Em Down NOLA in New Orleans where the city saw the removal of three confederate monuments in May.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019d been on the front lines for three or four years and saw no change,\u201d Sawyer said. \u201cI was encouraged to think of a small change that might be able to happen in the short term and I immediately focused on the monuments.\u201d\n\n\n\nBy 3 pm on Saturday, only a small pocket of anti-racist activists had come and gone. Neither the protesters nor the counter-protesters had the opportunity to lay eyes on one another. The Confederate 901 caravan never drove into the city, opting only to make a continuous loop around the I-240 for two hours before stopping at a rally point to disband outside of the city.\n\n\u201cWe did it and it was peaceful,\u201d said Billy Sessions as he sat back in his chair, exhausted and dazed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBack at a smoky hotel room in Arkansas a few minutes outside Memphis, Sessions, along with members of \u201cpatriot\u201d organizations Hiwaymen, the Carolina Defenders, and the leadership of Confederate 901, shared stories over beer.\n\nBut the protesters couldn\u2019t completely relax. They\u2019d received a number of threats on social media during the day, they said. A Springfield XD handgun sat on the nightstand, a remnant of the tension earlier that day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe night that the statues came down, I was angry,\u201d said George, a Confederate 901 organizer, who didn\u2019t want to give his last name. \u201cI\u2019m a real big history guy and a big fan of Nathan Bedford Forrest. I\u2019ve even been up there to clean the statue and I\u2019ve put flowers on his grave for the past four or five years. I have a great respect for him.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI know how inner-city Memphis is,\u201d added James Del Brock, co-founder of the Hiwaymen. \u201cI\u2019ve drove through a lot of it. I\u2019ve drove through it with my motorcycle and battle flag. I\u2019ve always wanted to know, because I\u2019m a white person, how to reach into the inner city without getting shot.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs they sipped their beers, the protesters signed a Confederate flag. The founder of the Carolina Defenders, who offered his first name, Tom, made a point to note that the signatures were in commemoration, not desecration.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t sit back and watch it anymore,\u201d Tom said. \u201cThere\u2019s a point where every American has to stand up and say, \u2018Look, our kids aren\u2019t going to have a future or anything to look forward to if the constitution keeps getting trashed the way it is.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOverall, though, the mood was hopeful. A man who would only identify himself as Phillip and the founder of Confederate 901 says the group is seeking 501c3 status. They recently received a $10,000 donation from a single donor. \u201cThe money is coming in,\u201d he said proudly.\n\nThis feature is part of Splinter\u2019s project to recruit local, embedded reporters, essayists, and photographers across the country.

For his part, Sater said that he had nothing to do with the Trump campaign.\n\nNews of the Moscow real estate deal came to light this week after Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee released a status report outlining dozens of leads they say they could not pursue after the Republicans shut down the committee\u2019s investigation, according to Business Insider.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere is a rundown of how Sater was pursuing the Moscow deal, from Business Insider:\n\nSater and Trump\u2019s longtime personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, were pushing for the deal with VTB in Moscow at the height of the presidential election, in late 2015 and early 2016. The revelation will likely draw sharp scrutiny from the special counsel Robert Mueller, who recently subpoenaed the Trump Organization for documents related to the Trump Tower Moscow deal. Sater first sent a non-binding letter of intent to Cohen outlining the terms of the \u201cTrump World Tower Moscow\u201d deal on October 13, 2015, The New York Times previously reported. Andrey Rozov, a Russian investor, had already signed it by the time Sater forwarded it to Cohen, and Trump signed the letter. Weeks later, the two men exchanged a series of emails gearing up to celebrate the Trump Tower Moscow deal. In the emails, obtained by The Times, Sater bragged about his relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin and told Cohen he would \u201cget all of Putins team to buy in\u201d on the deal. \u201cOur boy can become president of the USA and we can engineer it,\u201d Sater wrote, according to The Times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBesides being a Trump associate, Sater says that he has spent the past two decades as a top U.S. intelligence asset for the Defense Intelligence Agency, CIA and FBI. He even claims to have pursued high-level terrorists\u2014including Osama bin Laden.\n\nHe won\u2019t say whether or not he has been interviewed by Mueller. But it is very likely that Mueller is well aware of Sater\u2019s intelligence work because he was the FBI director during much of the time Sater was reportedly working for the feds.", "keywords": ["moscow", "deal", "russian", "bank", "intelligence", "pursued", "vtb", "real", "sanctioned", "election", "organization", "felix", "trump", "claims", "cohen", "tower", "sater"], "polarity": 0.0721596214243273, "subjectivity": 0.3495968084203378},

In the episode \u201cBlack Museum,\u201d which employs the same format as Black Mirror\u2019s \u201cWhite Christmas\u201d episode, the anthology within an anthology gives us brief tours into the horrors of technological advancements, culminating with one larger story arc\u2014that of Clayton, a black man whose virtual conscience is ceaselessly tortured in a vile, sadistic museum attraction.\n\n\n\nThe man to blame for this repulsive amusement park is the museum\u2019s proprietor, Rolo Haynes, who approaches Clayton Leigh while he is on death row for an alleged murder. Instead of looking into DNA evidence to clear Clayton\u2019s name as he is asked to do, Rolo instead convinces Clayton to sign over the rights to his post-death consciousness. When Clayton\u2019s pardon falls through due, in part, to negligence on Rolo\u2019s end, Clayton is given the electric chair. However, his signed agreement allows Rolo to reincarnate Clayton as a fully conscious hologram, and unbeknownst to Clayton or his family, Rolo has insidious intentions\u2014to imprison Clayton\u2019s reborn self in a museum exhibit.\n\nYou see, Clayton 2.0 isn\u2019t your typical hologram but instead a living, breathing electronic copy of Clayton that is conscious and can feel pain. Rolo uses this as a vehicle for profit, allowing museum visitors to electrically shock Clayton as a form of amusement, while Clayton bears the full and very real agony of electrocution. This morbid attraction, bundled with its equally morbid souvenir, a key chain that replays Clayton\u2019s tortured shrieks, is described by the museum\u2019s curator as a \u201cconscious sentient snapshot of Clayton ... perpetually experiencing that beautiful pain. Stuck forever in that one perfect moment of agony. Always on. Always suffering.\u201d\n\nThis quote and depiction, in many ways, illustrates America\u2019s historical obsession with black pain and its commodification for profit.\n\nSlavery is the glaring beginning of this horrific legacy as it forcibly turned black people into things that could be purchased, exploited for labor, brutalized and raped. Yet history does not stop there. Human zoos, which put black and brown bodies on display for zoo patrons to laugh and jeer at, were prominent throughout the 1800s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLater, lynching postcards were extremely popular items in the United States. These postcards displayed the gruesome murders of thousands of black people who were lynched over the course of a century and were bought, sold and sent as greetings between white families and friends.\n\nIn minstrelsy, white men donned blackface to spout false and harmful portrayals of black men and women.\n\nAll of these atrocities were businesses that turned black pain into capitalistic gain. But what happens when the commodity is a byproduct of pain? That is, to obtain the end product, pain must be inflicted. For the museum visitors to obtain their key chain trinket of Clayton, they must electrocute him. Similarly, goods such as the aforementioned lynching postcards and human zoos existed because they were able to collect a \u201cconscious sentient snapshot\u201d of black pain. Always on. Always suffering.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday these \u201csnapshots\u201d take the form of enterprises like the rap industry, in which artists recount trauma, suicidal thoughts and drug addiction while listeners sing along, or museums where people line up to pay to get a glimpse at the bloody slab of concrete where Martin Luther King Jr. took his last breath, or hashtag T-shirt companies whose sales literally depend on continued fatal encounters between black individuals and police officers. As James Allen expressed, \u201cIn America, everything is for sale, even national shame.\u201d\n\n\n\nChance the Rapper often speaks of the summer being a time of death in his community, because many are murdered during the hot months in Chicago. Lil Uzi Vert\u2019s \u201cXO Tour Llif3,\u201d Kendrick Lamar\u2019s \u201cu,\u201d Geto Boy\u2019s \u201cMind Playing Tricks on Me,\u201d Notorious B.I.G.\u2019s \u201cSuicidal Thoughts,\u201d Nas\u2019 \u201cDrunk by Myself,\u201d 2Pac\u2019s \u201cThug Mansion\u201d and Vic Mensa\u2019s \u201cThere\u2019s a Lot Going On\u201d all detail their deadly depression, thoughts of death by suicide and even suicide attempts. Hip-hop\u2019s lyricized accounts of poverty, addiction, violence and mental illness are purchased\u2014only to be blared through the speakers of middle-class white teenagers\u2019 cars.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack narratives aren\u2019t immune to hijacking, either. In film and television, our stories are told by white directors and producers for their glory and benefit\u2014as exemplified by the whiteness of the Oscars, Golden Globes and Emmys.\n\nThe media, in its \u201cheroic\u201d endeavors to report, builds its news reels, entertainment pieces and empire on the constant broadcasting of black pain for clicks and views.\n\nHell, our movements aren\u2019t even safe. Depictions of activism are used for commercials to sell Pepsi, a company whose CEO served on Donald Trump\u2019s Business Council, and social-action movements are co-opted by companies like Google and Microsoft, who made large contributions to Trump\u2019s campaign. These gestures are performative and utilized to maintain sales, influence and power.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis continued packaging and sale of black struggle is dangerous for it numbs the consumer to black pain, since they are not affected by it but are merely enjoyers of its fruits.\n\nThis numbing bolsters the normalization of black suffering, which, in turn, perpetuates a fallacy that black individuals have an inherent high pain tolerance\u2014and therefore are a) undeserving of empathy and b) immune to the atrocities inflicted upon them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is the same ridiculous notion that leads white physicians to withhold pain medication from black individuals under the falsehood that black people experience less pain than white people.\n\nIn other cases, it can create the artifice that black people are superhuman, which is evident in Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201csuperpredator\u201d comment as well as police officers\u2019 perceived need to use extreme force against unarmed black men out of a supposed fear for their lives. Then-Police Officer Darren Wilson displayed this type of thinking in his recount of the death of Mike Brown, whom he described as seemingly impervious to bullets.\n\nA worse scenario of the normalization of black pain manifests the normalization of black death, which is why videos of vicious killings like those of Sam Dubose and Philando Castile can go viral, being liked, shared and streamed millions of times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the cycle of the commodification of black pain, we become desensitized to black suffering in every form, even death.\n\n\n\n\u201cBlack Museum\u201d highlights some very important things about this disgusting cycle: the participants.\n\nIn \u201cBlack Museum,\u201d like in the real world, it is easy to blame the person who created the museum, but he or she is only half of the equation. It was Rolo who imprisoned Clayton, but it was the museum visitors who electrocuted him. It was the seemingly normal white tourists, families and children who pulled that lever, sending electric volts into Clayton\u2019s body.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust like it was the seemingly normal white families and children who turned lynchings into entertainment events, visited human zoos to gawk at Africans, and went to see minstrel shows.\n\nIt is easy to blame neo-Nazis, white supremacists and Trump for this roller coaster of an administration they\u2019ve built, but if many white folks, even the most benevolent, well-meaning white liberals, look in the mirror, they\u2019ll find that it is they who are holding the money to pay to get on the ride. And just like in the conclusion of Black Mirror: \u201cBlack Museum,\u201d they\u2019ll find that when one gets too comfortable participating in the act of black torture\u2014it rarely ends well.\n\n", "keywords": ["white", "americas", "zoos", "black", "conscious", "reckons", "commodifying", "museum", "history", "clayton", "rolo", "claytons", "mirror", "pain", "death"], "polarity": -0.010777253049980319, "subjectivity": 0.4535832349468708},

Prescott decision, The Root has decided to print the full decision as well as the minority opinion.\n\nStatement of Facts:\n\nOn July 4, 2016, at a family barbecue, Keisha Prescott was engaged in a spades match with her cousin James \u201cJ-Mac\u201d McDaniel. They were battling Keisha\u2019s aunt Margaret Parnell and her uncle Manuel Prescott (heretofore referred to by his more accepted moniker, \u201cMan Man.\u201d) Records show that \u201cAunt Margie\u201d is not a blood relative, but just a woman who lives across the street from Keisha\u2019s grandmother. (The court, however, allowed Parnell to ride with the \u201caunt\u201d designation because of the precedent set in the 1983 case of Aunt Wilma v. the State of Georgia)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Caucasian's Guide To Spades Whether it is played in the back of a college cafeteria, at a bachelor party, or during a Black\u2026 Read more Read\n\nThe contest, scheduled to end when one of the contestants reached a total of 350, was abruptly interrupted during the first hand. Holding the last card, after winning six of the seven books bid by her team, Keisha played the monochrome card with the word \u201cJoker\u201d emblazoned across the top. Man Man, in response, played the colorful version of the joker card and proceeded to rake the book (Rake\u2019em v. Take\u2019em; 1971), setting Keisha and James.\n\nA dispute emerged when both parties claimed to have won the book. Keisha noted that no one had stated which joker was the big joker, so she assumed hers was the bigger, because it had the word \u201cguarantee\u201d on it, while Man Man countered that his joker was obviously larger in size, meaning it was, by definition, the \u201cbig joker.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA lower-court decision by Uncle Lester declined to solve the debate when he ruled: \u201cMy name is Bennett, and I ain\u2019t in it.\u201d The group then appealed to the district court. That court\u2019s hearings were interrupted when the \u201cCha Cha\u201d Slide interrupted the proceedings, bringing the issue before this court.\n\nMajority Opinion:\n\nIt is the opinion of this court, by a 5-4 decision, that the black-and-white Joker is the supreme card in the game of spades.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the court recognizes that this opinion can be overridden by house rules, as stated in the 1953 decision, This Is My Damn House v. That Don\u2019t Make You Right, Luther, this specific case applies only in the rare instances that the big joker is not determined before the commencement of spades-related activities.\n\nThe majority of the bench agrees with Keisha\u2019s oral argument that \u201cif the biggest joker was always the big joker, there would be no need to mention it.\u201d Furthermore, the court found that Keisha\u2019s spades-playing abilities are impeccable.\n\nIn reviewing the score from the game in question, it was determined that Keisha had not overbid, even turning a \u201cpossible\u201d into a book when she led with a queen of hearts, holding the ace even though she only had two cards in said suit. The fact that she cut the king demonstrates a level of ability rarely seen by the bench.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause of this demonstrated ability, the court finds it highly unlikely that Keisha would have held her joker to be played last if she thought it was the little joker.\n\nMargie, on the other hand, was found to be deficient as an opponent and card player. She underbid by two books on this hand, and a subsequent investigation found her to have reneged on three previous occasions. Also, several witnesses testified, under penalty of perjury and not being allowed any more of Uncle Junior\u2019s ribs, that Margie referred to the clubs suit as \u201cpuppy toes\u201d more than once, indicating that she was a novice spades player at best.\n\nBecause Man-Man licked the card and affixed it to his forehead, we were able to order a DNA analysis. We discovered that\u2014although it is likely that he assumed his was the big joker\u2014Man Man\u2019s consumption of three Bud Lights and no less than three red Solo cups of brown liquor may have played a part in his lack of clarity in the matter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTherefore, based on the available evidence and Keisha\u2019s argument of \u201cNigga, what do you think \u2018Guarantee\u2019 means?\u201d We declare that the black-and-white joker\u2014despite the size of the drawing\u2014is definitely the big joker.\n\nDissenting Opinion\n\nIn this matter, we determined that Man Man and Margie\u2019s joker is the big joker based on one essential fact:\n\nIt. Is. Bigger.\n\nIf the card manufacturers had not intended for the card in question not to be identified as more important, would they have spent more time coloring it in? Furthermore, ignoring the size of the illustration belies the fact that it is, according to the laws of science, a bigger joker.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe also reject the premise that Man Man\u2019s seeming intoxication means his judgment may have been affected. In the 1964 case Johnson v. Everybody Else, the lower court\u2019s decision was overturned when the Supreme Court found that alcohol played no part in his renege accusations. Research shows that 82 percent of all spades games are played with one or more players under the influence of alcohol.\n\nThe court recognizes that a better decision could have been reached by replaying the hand. However, we recognize the house rules that being set in the first hand eliminates the opponents from contention.\n\nIt is the opinion of this court that, for reasons of clarity and by every metric of common sense, the big joker should be the bigger joker. We do, however, acknowledge the precedent of house rules.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur Ruling\n\nBy a 5-4 margin, the court rules in favor of the plaintiff.\n\nHowever, we also rule that J-Mac\u2019s slur that referred to his opponents as \u201ccheating motherfuckers\u201d no longer applies, as this was a legitimate dispute. As such, he must compensate Man Man with the fifth of Crown Royal that spilled when J-Mac knocked over the spades table.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe suggest that the person taking score write \u201cbig\u201d on the agreed-upon joker, and clarify whether or not the deuce of diamonds is a spade or not.

They report on a controversial dossier that said Trump hired prostitutes to defile space where the American president and first lady had slept.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPutin and his inner circle had nothing but utter contempt for Obama and his administration \u2014 much of it cast in racist terms,\u201d Isikoff and Corn write in \u201cRussian Roulette: : The Inside Story of Putin\u2019s War on America and the Election of Donald Trump.\u201d\n\n\u201cPutin and his top advisers routinely denigrated Obama and his national security team as \u2018weak\u2019 and \u2018indecisive\u2019 \u2014 and then, contradictorily, blamed him for meddling in Russia\u2019s internal affairs. In Putin\u2019s presence, Obama would be called a \u2018monkey,\u2019 and it was not uncommon for the American president to be referred to as the N-word.\u201d\n\nThe book has been No. 1 on the Amazon best-sellers list for the past two days, Brian Stelter reported Wednesday for his \u201cReliable Sources\u201d newsletter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCorn and Isikoff continued, \u201cThe small number of U.S. officials privy to the reports from this source wondered if Putin and his crew truly viewed Obama in such crude terms. But the source\u2019s credibility was bolstered by a recent episode.\n\n\u201cMonths earlier, Irina Rodnina, a Russian figure skater, posted a racist tweet showing a doctored photo of Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama looking like monkeys and admiring a banana. The U.S. Embassy lodged a protest, and Rodnina claimed on Twitter that her account had been hacked. When the Sochi Olympics opened, Putin selected Rodnina, a member of his United Russia Party in the Duma, as one of two Russian athletes to light the Olympic torch. This seemed like a not-too-veiled message. . . . \u201c\n\n\u201cRussian Roulette,\u201d released Tuesday and accompanied by a blizzard of media appearances by its authors, repeats information from a dossier put together by the former British intelligence agent Christopher Steele. Steele had headed Britain\u2019s intelligence Russia desk, then started his own private investigative agency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQuoting the dossier, the authors write, \u201cSource D, described as \u2018a close associate of TRUMP who had organized and managed his recent trips to Moscow,\u2019 claimed that \u2018TRUMP\u2019s (perverted) conduct in Moscow included hiring the presidential suite of the Ritz Carlton Hotel, where he knew President and Mrs. OBAMA (whom he hated) had stayed on one of their official trips to Russia, and defiling the bed where they had slept by employing a number of prostitutes to perform a \u2018golden showers\u2019 (urination) show in front of him. . . .\u201d\n\nThe Steele dossier was published in full in January 2017 by BuzzFeed, which stated that the claims were all unsubstantiated and unverified but deserved to be made public. Other media outlets accused BuzzFeed of being irresponsible. However, the material in the dossier was said to have been shown to both Trump and Obama.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe authors write that Susan Rice, Obama\u2019s national security adviser, had encouraged James Clapper, director of national intelligence, during the daily intelligence briefing to tell Obama about the \u201cgolden showers\u201d allegation.\n\n\u201cObama turned to Rice and said, \u2018Why am I hearing this?\u2019 He was incredulous,\u201d Isikoff and Corn write. \u201c \u2018What\u2019s happening?\u2019 he asked. Rice said the intelligence community had no idea if this story was true but that Obama needed to be aware the allegation was circulating. \u2018You don\u2019t really expect to hear the term \u201cgolden showers\u201d in the President [cq] Daily Brief,\u2019 a participant in this meeting later said, \u2018or that the guy who is going to become president may be a Manchurian candidate.\u2019 . . .\u201d\n\nThe reporters also write, \u201cWhen [Vice President Joseph P.] Biden was briefed about intelligence reports on the connections between various players in the Trump orbit and the Kremlin, he had a visceral reaction. \u2018If this is true,\u2019 he exclaimed, \u2018it\u2019s treason.\u2019 . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cRussian Roulette\u201d has a larger focus than Obama and race, as Steven Lee Myers wrote in a review published Wednesday by the New York Times. Myers notes that its \u201csubtitle promises to reveal \u2018the inside story of Putin\u2019s war on America and the election of Donald Trump,\u2019 but adds, \u201cAlas, it does not \u2014 at least so far as offering foolproof evidence of Putin\u2019s involvement, or his motives.\u201d\n\nStill, an excerpt published in Mother Jones touches on Trump\u2019s posture toward women of color. The setting is a 2013 visit to Moscow to support the Miss Universe pageant, which he owned.\n\n\u201cFrequently, Trump would toss out finalists and replace them with others he preferred. \u2018If there were too many women of color, he would make changes,\u2019 a Miss Universe staffer later noted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAnother Miss Universe staffer recalled, \u2018He often thought a woman was too ethnic or too dark-skinned. He had a particular type of woman he thought was a winner. Others were too ethnic. He liked a type. There was Olivia Culpo, Dayanara Torres [the 1993 winner], and, no surprise, East European women.\u201d On occasion, according to this staffer, Trump would reject a woman \u2018who had snubbed his advances.\u2019\n\n\u201cOnce in a while,\u201d Paula Shugart, the president of the Miss Universe Organization, \u201c would politely challenge Trump\u2019s choices. Sometimes she would win the argument, sometimes not. \u2018If he didn\u2019t like a woman because she looked too ethnic, you could sometimes persuade him by telling him she was a princess and married to a football player,\u2019 a staffer later explained. . . .\u201d\n\nPhilip Bump, Washington Post: 4.4 million 2012 Obama voters stayed home in 2016 \u2014 more than a third of them black\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavid Corn and Michael Isikoff, Mother Jones: \u201cWhy the Hell Are We Standing Down?\u201d (book excerpt)\n\n\n\nDavid Corn and Michael Isikoff, Mother Jones: What Happened in Moscow: The Inside Story of How Trump\u2019s Obsession With Putin Began (book excerpt)\n\n\n\nJarvis DeBerry, NOLA.com | Times-Picayune: Steve Scalise\u2019s bizarre claim that Donald Trump\u2019s been tough on Russia\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJeff Jacoby, Boston Globe: Deval Patrick for president?

Then came a loud pop as a bullet went right through Courtlin\u2019s heart, ending her life way too short of adulthood.\n\n\u2018 \u2018The last thing I told them was \u201cI love you\u201d and have a blessed day at school,\u2019 Courtlin\u2019s mom, Tynesha Tatum, who has another son and daughter in the same high school, told the Birmingham News. \u2018That was at 7:45 a.m\u2026At 3:45 p.m., I got a call that my baby got shot.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOn Wednesday, Courtlin\u2019s schoolmates \u2014 her murder still ringing in their ears \u2014 are planning to walk out of school and protest the lack of safety for teenagers trying to grow up in the most gun-crazed nation on the planet.

But it\u2019s almost a lock that you haven\u2019t heard at all about the loss of Courtlin Arrington.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t Parkland, Florida, where the mass shooting of 17 kids in the upscale Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School upended the world of students who\u2019d been raised to expect the best things in life \u2014 and thus triggered a social revolution that is only starting to grow. No, Courtlin Arrington was killed by a handgun inside Huffman High School in Birmingham, Ala., in the kind of struggling urban district where kids have grown all too accustomed to hardship, even to violence.\n\n\u201cEven so, it was somewhat shocking that a shooting inside a school classroom received virtually no national coverage . . .\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOf course, one death may seem less impactful than one of the 10 largest mass shootings in U.S. history, but tell that to Courtlin\u2019s classmates who will be traumatized by the sound of that fatal gunshot for the rest of their lives. There\u2019s no definitive way to know how much of the ignoring of her story was simply fatigue, in a nation where gun deaths remain off the charts, and how much is because both Courtlin and her alleged killer are African-Americans. . . .\u201d\n\nJenice Armstrong, Philadelphia Daily News: We must all support Wednesday\u2019s student walkout to toughen gun laws\n\nJarvis DeBerry, NOLA.com | Times-Picayune: New Orleans students to demand gun control in National School Walkout\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEditorial, Baltimore Sun: Student walkout: Protest has a price\n\n\n\nEditorial, Buffalo News: In support of the student walkout\n\n\n\nEditorial, Chicago Sun-Times: In Chicago, 79 dead of guns so far this year.

In fact, he\u2019s a pathological liar with a history of lying and then just nonchalantly acting as if what he\u2019s doing isn\u2019t lying.\n\n\n\nDuring one stretch from Jan 21. to Feb. 27, the New York Times found that the president lied publicly some 38 times. He lied about not being a fan of the Iraq War, which he totally was. He lied about how many times he appeared on Time magazine\u2019s cover; he claimed that he\u2019d been on the cover more than anyone else, but turns out he\u2019d been on the cover 15 times and former President Richard Nixon had appeared 55 times. He even lied about about two people getting shot in Chicago the same day President Barack Obama was in town making a speech; reports confirmed that no one was shot the day Obama delivered his speech.\n\nTrump lies; it\u2019s just what he does. While his lies are easily disproved, it\u2019s rare that he will readily admit that he lied, much less admit it to another world leader. The Washington Post got its hands on a fundraising speech Trump made Wednesday in which he openly admitted to making up claims during his meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. He just randomly spouted that the United States runs a trade deficit with Canada without even knowing whether that was true.\n\nHere\u2019s how the Post breaks down the audio of Trump speaking during a private event:\n\n\u201cTrudeau came to see me. He\u2019s a good guy, Justin. He said, \u2018No, no, we have no trade deficit with you, we have none. Donald, please,\u2019 \u201d Trump said, mimicking Trudeau. [...] \u201cNice guy, good-looking guy, comes in \u2014 \u2018Donald, we have no trade deficit.\u2019 He\u2019s very proud because everybody else, you know, we\u2019re getting killed. \u201c ... So, he\u2019s proud. I said, \u2018Wrong, Justin, you do.\u2019 I didn\u2019t even know. ... I had no idea. I just said, \u2018You\u2019re wrong.\u2019 You know why? Because we\u2019re so stupid. \u2026 And I thought they were smart. I said, \u2018You\u2019re wrong, Justin.\u2019 He said, \u2018Nope, we have no trade deficit.\u2019 I said, \u2018Well, in that case, I feel differently,\u2019 I said, \u2018but I don\u2019t believe it.\u2019 I sent one of our guys out, his guy, my guy, they went out, I said, \u2018Check, because I can\u2019t believe it.\u2019 \u2018Well, sir, you\u2019re actually right. We have no deficit, but that doesn\u2019t include energy and timber. \u2026 And when you do, we lose $17 billion a year.\u2019 It\u2019s incredible.\u201d The Office of the United States Trade Representative says the United States has a trade surplus with Canada. It reports that in 2016, the United States exported $12.5 billion more in goods and services than it imported from Canada, leading to a trade surplus, not a deficit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause Trump\u2019s a notorious liar who actually believes his own lies, he took to Twitter on Thursday to double down on his totally false and made-up accusation.\n\nBruce Heyman, the U.S. ambassador to Canada from 2014 to 2017, blasted Trump over his remarks, tweeting that the president was \u201ccreating a crisis where none existed,\u201d USA Today reports: \u201cLying to your friends only hurts the relationship. Canada has been there for us thru thick and thin. How can you casually damage this realtionship [sic]? Shame on you!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the tape obtained by the Post, Trump attacked the North American Free Trade Agreement, reached by the U.S., Canada and Mexico, which is currently being renegotiated. And he openly mocked other politicians for wanting to keep NAFTA. He called Mexico \u201cspoiled\u201d and added that Canada had outsmarted the United States. \u201cThe best deal is to terminate it and make a new deal,\u201d he said, according to USA Today.\n\nClearly, Trump doesn\u2019t understand how any of this works.

Despite all signs pointing to Russia, the Trump administration has been adamant that while it was standing with the United Kingdom, it weren\u2019t going to rush to judgment and blame the Russians, despite the clues\u2014including a blinking road sign indicating that Russia did this.\n\n\n\nProbably didn\u2019t help matters that Tillerson at one time famously\u2014well, it\u2019s still allegedly, but we totally know that Tillerson did that shit\u2014called Donald Trump a \u201cfucking moron.\u201d\n\nBut here is arguably the best story that shows how Trump\u2019s relationship with Tillerson goes much deeper than expecting him to ignore Russia\u2019s manipulation of our politics or the U.K.\u2019s: According to the Wall Street Journal, during a meeting with the Chinese, Trump went all Ike Turner on Tillerson and demanded that he eat the salad:\n\nMr. Trump, in the midst of a five-country tour of Asia, grew concerned the untouched greens would offend the Chinese, according to people familiar with the matter.

In November, as the Post previously reported, she and her 7-year-old child presented themselves to border agents in San Diego, where they passed a screening interview with an asylum officer.\n\nHowever, days later, the daughter was forcibly taken from her mother and the two were placed in separate detention centers thousands of miles apart. The mother was detained in a center in San Diego; the daughter was shipped to a Chicago detention center, where she has been kept for the past four months.\n\nNow the mother has been released, but she has yet to receive word on the status of her daughter, with whom she\u2019s only had a few phone conversations since they were torn apart.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe stark details of the case\u2014immigration authorities have never provided any real justification for separating the mother and child\u2014prompted the American Civil Liberties Union to file a lawsuit against the U.S. government, charging that it violated the family\u2019s constitutional rights. The suit also calls for the two to be reunited immediately.\n\nSeparating a family seeking refuge is the sort of bureaucratic cruelty that\u2019s been the calling card of Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policy (while Barack Obama\u2019s track record on deportations is nothing to exalt, it was policy under his administration for women and children to be held together at detention centers). But as the Post\u2019s op-ed pointed out, what makes this case and others like it particularly heinous is that immigration officials can\u2019t get their stories straight about why they would separate parents from their child.\n\n\u201cA year ago, then-Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly said publicly that his department might separate children from parents caught crossing the border, including those fleeing violence and seeking asylum, as a punitive means of deterring others who might follow,\u201d the Post\u2019s editorial board wrote, adding that Kelly\u2019s successor, Kirstjen Nielsen, floated a similar idea again in December.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut DHS officials now claim that they would only separate minors from their parents for the child\u2019s protection. In the case of the Congolese mother and the ACLU lawsuit, one DHS official told the Post in a statement that the department doesn\u2019t \u201ccurrently have a policy of separating women and children,\u201d but noted that the department may do so, \u201cparticularly to protect a child from potential smuggling and trafficking activities.\u201d\n\nOf course, that clearly isn\u2019t the case for the Congolese mother and her daughter\u2014otherwise, why would the former have been released? For now, the administration is maintaining its silence on the matter, and the two still have no idea why they were separated, and whether they will be reunited.\n\n\u201cEach time S.S.\u201d\u2014the 7-year-old daughter\u2014\u201cis able to speak with her mother on the phone, she is crying,\u201d reads the ACLU lawsuit. \u201cEvery day that S.S. is separated from her mother causes her greater emotional and psychological harm and could potentially lead to permanent emotional trauma.\u201d", "keywords": ["seeking", "refuge", "explain", "lawsuit", "report", "immigration", "detention", "mother", "congolese", "daughter", "case", "torn", "separate", "apart", "parents", "border", "post", "policy"], "polarity": 0.038505747126436785, "subjectivity": 0.4295977011494253},

It looked like a lot of fun!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is speculation that the entire fraternity could be kicked off the yard because of an ongoing investigation by Robert Mueller.

I\u2019m going to keep saying that we need to impeach him.\u201d\n\nSo Donald Trump\u2019s latest racist dog whistle to challenge Auntie Maxine\u2019s IQ falls on deaf ears because she was hip to who this president was long before he took office.\n\nIt\u2019s sad when America\u2019s aunt is probably America\u2019s toughest person and our biggest ally in the fight against blatant bigotry and racism. The president is currently running around the White House buck naked, and not one Democrat is willing to say he\u2019s not wearing any clothes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough it\u2019s heartwarming to see Waters so strong and willing to stand in her convictions against a divisive president who runs his administration like a schoolyard bully with unlimited Wi-Fi, it also saddens me that there aren\u2019t more Democrats willing to stand beside Auntie Maxine and call for Trump\u2019s ouster.\n\nAs it stands, those on the \u201cImpeach 45\u201d bandwagon are outliers for a more Rodney King, \u201cLet\u2019s all just get along\u201d Democratic vision, which is the equivalent of thinking that the schoolyard bully will understand anything but violence. At some point we\u2019ve got to move beyond reasoning. Auntie Maxine knew that from the beginning, and therefore had no intention of trying to work with this man or this administration.\n\nThey say that with age comes wisdom, and that\u2019s the advantage that Maxine Waters has over her fellow Democrats. She\u2019s faced down bullies before and knows from experience that sometimes you have to be willing to put your book bag down and stand up for yourself.

On Tuesday, Donald Trump not only fired the secretary of state\u2014and stand-in for every daytime soap opera\u2019s mean oil baron\u2014Rex Tillerson, but he also got rid of some guy named John McEntee, who was his personal assistant.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, McEntee was let go because of issues surrounding his security clearance. McEntee could be heard screaming, \u201cThis is bullshit! Jared Kushner\u2019s ass couldn\u2019t get clearance to ride on a Greyhound bus, but I\u2019m fired?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFine, McEntee wasn\u2019t heard screaming, but his ass was reportedly escorted out of the White House\u2014according to one official, he didn\u2019t even have a chance to take any of his belongings, not even his jacket\u2014because escorting people out of places where they have been fired is mad degrading and I\u2019m here for it. I want to have security at my next house party just so I can randomly walk through and ask that someone who doesn\u2019t use a coaster be escorted out and then look at them like an evil slave owner as they feebly attempt to explain with their eyes that it was all a mistake.\n\nDoes any of us know who McEntee is? Of course not. Does it matter that he\u2019s been fired? Well, kind of. The Trump administration has been a mess since infancy. Clearly the president is in over his head in policy he doesn\u2019t understand, and anyone who tries to tell him different is getting the big boot. Speaking of big boots, I\u2019m totally fine with cutting Florida off the map at any point ... because ... Florida.\n\nFlorida, Man You know how something happens in the news, and it\u2019s incredibly weird and far-fetched, and as you\u2026 Read more Read\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor those who care, McEntee had been with the president during his campaign, and he also carried a messenger bag over his shoulder and not across his body. Men who don\u2019t put the messenger-bag strap across their body can\u2019t be trusted, and McEntee\u2019s ill-advised handling of his messenger bag proves that he didn\u2019t deserve to be in the Beverly Hillbillies White House.\n\nA White House official told WSJ, \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be great for morale.\u201d\n\nWelp, that\u2019s it, folks, nothing more to see here. McEntee was at the White House and now he isn\u2019t, and while none of us knew who he was, he will be missed. I guess. Also, something tells me that Trump isn\u2019t done letting people go. He\u2019s like the uncle who once threw three touchdowns in a junior varsity nonconference game and can\u2019t stop talking about it at every Thanksgiving even though he\u2019s 74 years old and was in high school in the 1950s. Trump\u2019s glory days were when he was on The Apprentice, and it looks like no one wants to tell him that he doesn\u2019t have to fire people each week.", "keywords": ["white", "hes", "president", "report", "aide", "mcentee", "im", "doesnt", "trump", "tell", "fired", "fires", "believes", "house", "apprentice", "shooting", "personal"], "polarity": 0.002449494949494953, "subjectivity": 0.45866161616161616},

According to the Post, Trump asked him to step aside on Friday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn October of last year it was reported that Tillerson called Trump a \u201cfucking moron\u201d in a meeting. Tillerson then had to publicly grovel and affirm that Trump was indeed \u201csmart,\u201d but the sense that his time was coming to an end still hung in the air\u2014so much so that Trump had to publicly refute it. Here is a fun tweet from just last December:\n\nGina Haspel, deputy director of the CIA, has been nominated to succeed Pompeo. As a CIA officer under George W. Bush, Haspel oversaw so-called \u201cblack sites\u201d where suspects were tortured.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis major change comes just weeks after a number of top aides resigned from the White House and right before Trump\u2019s planned historic meeting with North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un.
