Schell, the director of the Center on U.S.-China Relations at the Asia Society.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe disillusionment with China, he said, began setting in long before Mr. Xi cemented his grip on the Politburo. Be it saber-rattling in the South China Sea, proselytizing on American college campuses, theft of corporate secrets or censorship of the web, China has alienated one constituency after another in the United States.\n\n\u201cThe military is gone, the press is gone, the intellectuals are gone, civil society is gone and now the businessmen are gone,\u201d said Mr. Schell, who arranged the dinner for Mr. Bannon and has deep ties to China. \u201cIf you\u2019re taking the long view, you\u2019d have to say we\u2019re on diverging pathways.\u201d\n\nBeyond a general spike in tensions, however, the results of this widening divide are difficult to predict, experts and former officials said, because it is occurring against a backdrop of uncertainty in Beijing and Washington.\n\nMr. Xi\u2019s ascension, experts said, reflects not only his formidable power but also China\u2019s economic instability. Markets were rattled by news last week that the Chinese government seized the Anbang Insurance Group, a debt-ridden conglomerate that owns the Waldorf Astoria hotel and once negotiated to invest in a Manhattan skyscraper owned by the family of the president\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s handling of China reflects not only his protectionist trade agenda and America First foreign policy, but also his reluctance to antagonize Mr. Xi personally \u2014 a peculiar deference that prompted the tough questions directed at Mr. Bannon over dinner.\n\nFor all his thunderous criticism of China as an economic predator, Mr. Trump has yet to impose a sweeping trade sanction against it. He declined to label China a currency manipulator last year because he said the timing was bad: Mr. Xi had agreed to help the United States press North Korea to curb its nuclear and missile programs.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cChina, we probably lost $504 billion, last year, on trade,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Monday at a meeting with governors, a day after Mr. Xi\u2019s bid to lead indefinitely became public. But he added: \u201cI think that President Xi is unique. He\u2019s helping us with North Korea.\u201d\n\nStrongman on the Rise\n\nThe White House is preparing tariffs on steel and aluminum that would target China and other exporters. It has conducted an investigation into China\u2019s theft of intellectual property, which could result in restrictions on Chinese investment in the United States and retaliatory measures against its consumer electronics products.\n\nDomestic politics, in a year of midterm elections, may drive Mr. Trump to take a harder line. Democrats, who are historically closer to Mr. Trump on trade than most Republicans, have signaled that they will use the president\u2019s tough-on-China stance against him if he does not act soon.\n\n\u201cNow that it\u2019s clear that President Xi isn\u2019t going anywhere, getting tough on China is even more of an imperative,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. \u201cIf President Trump and Congress don\u2019t crack down on their rapacious trade practices,\u201d he added, \u201cChina will continue eating our lunch for years to come.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But after years of struggling to break into the Chinese markets, suffering the theft of their corporate secrets, many American companies are exhausted.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re hearing businesses that work in China use words like reciprocity and retaliation far more than you ever have,\u201d said Scott Mulhauser, a former chief of staff at the American Embassy in Beijing. \u201cFolks are increasingly frustrated and wrestling with how best to deal with it.\u201d\n\nThe frustration is not across the board: Manufacturers tend to be more fed up than Wall Street, which continues to do lucrative investment-banking business with the Chinese government. Technology companies have soured on China, though the market is so vast that they are still willing to consider concessions they would make nowhere else in the world.\n\nThe Trump administration reflects those fissures. Advisers like Gary D. Cohn, director of the National Economic Council, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who both worked at Goldman Sachs, have persuaded Mr. Trump to hold off on tough trade measures against China in the past.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut there are signs that the White House\u2019s nationalist wing is ascendant. Peter Navarro, an economist whose books include \u201cDeath by China\u201d and \u201cThe Coming China Wars,\u201d is to be promoted, and his ideas seem again in vogue with the president.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn the issue of national security, the administration enshrined a harsher stance toward China in the president\u2019s National Security Strategy. The report characterized China in Cold War-like terms, as a revisionist power that will try \u201cto erode American security and prosperity.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s influence on bastions of higher education has also come under scrutiny. The director of the F.B.I., Christopher A. Wray, testified recently that he believed universities were underestimating the ability of Chinese students to collect valuable national security intelligence. He expressed concern about the Confucius Institute, a global learning network sponsored by the Chinese government, whose expansion has elicited criticism over whether it is a tool to influence public opinion about China.\n\nBy itself, some former officials said, Mr. Xi\u2019s move to stay in power should not augur greater conflict with the United States. He is expected to elevate Wang Qishan to vice president and give him a major role in managing the relationship. And he dispatched a senior economic adviser, Liu He, to Washington this week to meet with the administration. Both men are respected in the United States.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s something inherent in dictatorships and one-man rule that causes clashes with U.S. interests, other than, of course, the conflict in values,\u201d said Jeffrey A. Bader, a former China adviser to President Barack Obama.\n\nFor some China hands, the wave of disillusionment reflects unrealistic hopes about how much China was ever going to converge with the United States. John L. Thornton, a former Goldman Sachs president who has taught at Tsinghua University in Beijing, said that in a chaotic world, the two countries should focus on what unites, rather than what divides, them.\n\n\u201cAt one end of the spectrum is order and at the other end is disorder,\u201d Mr. Thornton said. \u201cChina and the United States are clearly on the same end of the spectrum.\u201d", "keywords": ["conflict", "trade", "states", "tightens", "president", "mr", "gone", "ahead", "grip", "china", "trump", "united", "chinese", "sees", "xi"], "polarity": 0.019759512830165013, "subjectivity": 0.3198749921576008},

The biggest single expenditure of the $17 million it spent in 2017 was the $5.5 million it paid for digital advertising, nearly all of which passed through firms owned by Mr. Parscale.\n\nOther notable expenditures were $3.1 million on legal expenses, $1.5 million on merchandise \u2014 including the red Make America Great Again hats \u2014 and nearly $800,000 on Trump properties, including rent on the campaign\u2019s Trump Tower office space.

When the campaign gave presentations to reporters in the final two weeks of the 2016 campaign, Mr. Parscale used the website 270towin.com to show the path to victory, as opposed to presenting sophisticated models.\n\nThe specifics of Mr. Parscale\u2019s involvement in the Trump campaign, including his tactics to reach voters using social media platforms, has also been of interest to lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Last year, he agreed to meet with the House Intelligence Committee as part of its investigation into Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cI am unaware of any Russian involvement in the digital and data operations of the 2016 Trump presidential campaign,\u201d Mr. Parscale said after he agreed to appear. \u201cThe only collaboration I am aware of in the Trump digital campaign was with staff provided to the campaign by Facebook, Google and Twitter.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump may be itching to hit the campaign trail, where he is happiest, but the White House still has a rail-thin political operation. Despite efforts to hire new staff members, it has struggled for months to catch up to speed. And on Tuesday, the West Wing was set to lose another key aide: Mr. Kushner\u2019s spokesman, Josh Raffel, said he would be departing.\n\nThe 2020 campaign announcement, as is common in Trump world, didn\u2019t quite go off without a hitch: For starters, it initially alarmed ethics experts, who said its description of Mr. Kushner as \u201csenior adviser and assistant to the president, and President Trump\u2019s son-in-law,\u201d was in violation of the Hatch Act, which prohibits political activities by government employees.

Bush administration, said in an interview. \u201cThey don\u2019t have any idea what the rules are, and they really don\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nThe timing of the announcement also came hours before the disclosure that Mr. Kushner\u2019s security clearance level had been downgraded.", "keywords": ["family", "described", "2020", "2016", "mr", "trumps", "announcement", "trumpian", "million", "kushner", "rollout", "parscale", "trump", "campaign"], "polarity": 0.09836670274170274, "subjectivity": 0.3397871572871573},

International relations, he said, requires respect for local privacy laws.\n\n\u201cNo one disputes that countries across the world believe that they have the sovereignty and the sovereign right to pass their own laws governing the access to emails stored on their soil,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd here we are reaching into their lands and imposing our U.S. position on who gets access to emails on their soil.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Dreeben disputed that. \u201cThere is not an international problem here,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is largely a mirage that Microsoft is seeking to create.\u201d\n\nHe added that there is a fundamental misconception about the dispute. \u201cIt\u2019s not a case about privacy,\u201d he said, as the government must satisfy a high burden to obtain the data it seeks.\n\n\u201cThe government has the gold standard of an instrument to address privacy interests here: a probable-cause-based warrant issued by a judge that describes with particularity what we want,\u201d Mr. Dreeben said. \u201cThat is the hallmark in our domestic system of how privacy interests are addressed.\u201d\n\nA ruling upholding the warrant, Microsoft has warned, would embolden foreign countries to seek the emails of Americans stored in the United States.

He Never Won Them in the First Place                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/27/upshot/trump-losing-college-educated-whites-he-never-won-them-in-the-first-place.html", "text": "Advertisement\n\nTrump Losing College-Educated Whites? He Never Won Them in the First Place New evidence that exit polls are a very flawed vehicle for doing post-election analysis.\n\nAfter Donald J. Trump\u2019s upset victory in the 2016 presidential election, one data point from the network exit polls jumped out at analysts: his two-point win among college-educated white voters.\n\nMany pre-election polls had suggested they would favor Hillary Clinton. And now, more than a year later, polls again show Mr. Trump with striking weakness among well-educated white voters, implying he has alienated many who backed him in 2016.\n\nBut it is increasingly clear that there\u2019s another explanation: The exit polls were wrong. Mr. Trump never won college-educated white voters, and therefore he hasn\u2019t lost nearly as much ground among the group as it seems.\n\nThe exit polls\u2019 overestimate of Mr. Trump\u2019s support among well-educated white voters is symptomatic of the survey\u2019s deeper problem: a tendency to severely underrepresent older, white voters without a college degree. Thanks to an odd methodological quirk in exit polling, this underlying problem ultimately biases the rest of the survey, along with the analysis that follows.\n\nAt this point, there is no question that the exit polls underestimate the number of white working-class voters, especially older ones, by a considerable amount. This is clear in census and voter file data, which are widely preferred as measures of the composition of the electorate by pollsters, academics and analysts.\n\nThe newest evidence comes from a Pew Research study on voter registration files. To my knowledge, it is the first nationally representative probability sample matched to vote history data from the 2016 election. According to the Pew data, 45 percent of 2016 voters were whites without a college degree \u2014 11 percentage points higher than the 34 percent vote share calculated by the exit poll, which is conducted by Edison Research for a consortium of media organizations.\n\nHow could the exit poll be off by so much? In fact, most polls are represented by too many well-educated respondents; most high-quality surveys weight their samples to adequately represent less educated voters. But the exit polls aren\u2019t weighted by education, and so they start and end with far too many well-educated voters. (The exit polls are weighted only by demographic characteristics that the exit poll interviewer can visually identify, like gender, whether someone is African-American, and a rough guess of age; they can\u2019t guess education.)\n\nThis winds up biasing the rest of the survey because the exit polls are weighted to match the actual result of a far less educated country. In general, the exit polls underestimate Republican support, probably in no small part because they overrepresent young, nonwhite and well-educated voters. But this process leaves the underlying educational bias of the sample intact, and the result is that Republican-leaning voters are given more weight to compensate for an electorate that represents Democratic-leaning voting groups.\n\nIn the end, the exit poll overestimates Republican support among most demographic groups, including well-educated white voters, and it overestimates the number of voters from Democratic-leaning voting blocs, like young, nonwhite and well-educated voters.\n\nThose two facts go a long way toward explaining why there were so many Democratic-friendly analyses of voting demographics and polls over the last decade. The exit polling made it seem as if the Republicans, in a diversifying country, could not win with big gains among older, white working-class voters.\n\nAnd if the exit polls overestimate Republican vote share among various demographic groups, then pre-election national polls will seem to show Democrats doing well, since they\u2019re weighted by education and aren\u2019t adjusted to match a result. The exit poll tendency to overestimate Republican vote share will also tend to obscure Republican strength in pre-election polls, like Mr. Trump\u2019s big gains among white voters without a college degree.\n\nOver the last year or so, national media organizations have made a concerted effort to cover those white working-class voters. Some have argued that those efforts have gone too far. But so far there has been little or no movement to better represent white working-class voters in public political data and analysis. Only a handful of state pollsters have begun to weight by education, and the exit polls have not announced any methodological changes intended to remedy these issues either.\n\nThe consequences can be significant. For better or worse, lawmakers and campaigns make policy decisions based on political calculations, and the exit polls play a huge role in shaping how people judge the landscape of American electoral politics. Even Fox News\u2019s Sean Hannity briefly supported comprehensive immigration reform in November 2012, after the exit polls made it seem as though Hispanic voters, not white working-class Midwesterners, decided the election in President Obama\u2019s favor.\n\nOne way to avoid the issue: retire the use of the exit polls in post-election analysis, and make apples-to-apples comparisons between current and older pre-election polls. The most important trends of the 2016 election were more apparent using this approach, including Mr. Trump\u2019s strength among white working-class voters. And today, it would make President Trump seem more resilient among well-educated white voters.\n\nNate Cohn is a domestic correspondent for The Upshot. He covers elections, polling and demographics.

Heather Nauert, spokeswoman for the State Department, said in a statement that Mr. Yun was retiring \u201cfor personal reasons\u201d and that Rex W. Tillerson, the secretary of state, \u201creluctantly accepted his decision.\u201d\n\nAnalysts were taken aback.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely sad news,\u201d said Andrei Lankov, a North Korea expert at Kookmin University in Seoul, South Korea. Mr. Yun \u201cis very much in favor of compromise and negotiations, and it seems that his voice is not going to be heard.\u201d\n\nFor the last year and a half, tensions have been building on the Korean Peninsula as both Mr. Trump and Kim Jong-un, North Korea\u2019s leader, have ratcheted up bellicose attacks that seemed to push the United States and the North closer to a confrontation.\n\nThe respite of the Olympics \u2014 to which North Korea sent 22 athletes and an entourage of dignitaries, cheerleaders and musical performers \u2014 along with a break in North Korean missile and nuclear tests since last November raised hopes that tensions were finally easing.\n\nBut no sooner had the North and the United States declared their willingness to talk to each other \u2014 something they have in fact done before \u2014 than it became clear that the two sides remained stubbornly far apart.\n\n\u201cThe North Koreans have always said they would be happy to talk to the United States, and in fact they are eager to come and talk to us \u2014 as one nuclear weapons state to another,\u201d said Ralph Cossa, president of the Pacific Forum at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cAnd the U.S. is willing to talk to the North Koreans if they are prepared to put nuclear weapons on the table. So both sides are willing to talk, but not about the same thing.\u201d\n\nWhile leading the United States delegation to the Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, earlier this month, Vice President Mike Pence planned to secretly meet with a high-level delegation from North Korea, but the North Koreans canceled at the last minute, according to the State Department.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThis is the real challenge with North Korea,\u201d said Mr. Cossa. \u201cIf you try to confront them, they get their backs up and feel they have to be more confrontational back, to show they are not afraid.\u201d\n\n\u201dBut if you make an overture, they see this as a weakness they have to exploit,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd if you offer them the moon and the stars, they say \u2018O.K., we want the sun also.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe United Nations Security Council has imposed increasingly strict sanctions on North Korea over its weapons program, but policing violations can be difficult.

A parent company that terminates a franchise agreement to avoid doing business with a franchisee whose workers are trying to unionize may face legal liability for doing so if it is considered a joint employer.\n\nIn December, the board, with its new Republican majority, took up a case known as Hy-Brand and voted to revert to the pre-2015 standard requiring direct and immediate control.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut that case did not raise any questions that hinged on what standard to apply \u2014 the Obama-era guidelines or the previous ones.

If the more recent case was simply a do-over for the previous case, the inspector general argued, then Mr. Emanuel should have recused himself.\n\nMs. Liebman, the former chairwoman, said the board would presumably be able to try again. But she said it would have to wait for a case raising its own questions about which joint-employer doctrine is correct, rather than simply use any vaguely related case as a pretext for revisiting the Obama-era decision.\n\n\u201cIn some future case, where the issue actually arises and some party is seeking a reversal of Browning-Ferris, where more of a deliberation goes on, that could be another vehicle,\u201d she said, adding that there was less likely to be a conflict for Mr. Emanuel in that instance. \u201cThis is likely just a reprieve.\u201d\n\nFor their part, business groups frustrated with the frequently shifting joint-employer definition argued that it was yet another reason for Congress to settle the issue with legislation.\n\n\u201cThis throws the whole situation back into question for a potentially extended period,\u201d said Matthew Haller, a senior vice president at the International Franchise Association. \u201cOur focus has been \u2014 and remains \u2014 on the need for Congress to provide legislative certainty.\u201d\n\nMr. Haller added that the House had passed such legislation in November and that it was now all the more urgent for the Senate \u201cto step into the breach.\u201d", "keywords": ["boards", "board", "case", "workers", "employer", "franchisee", "standard", "intact", "browningferris", "joint", "mr", "obamaera", "rule", "doover", "company", "labor", "leaves"], "polarity": 0.07975503332646187, "subjectivity": 0.40048100048100055},

Be it saber-rattling in the South China Sea, proselytizing on American college campuses, theft of corporate secrets or censorship of the web, China has alienated one constituency after another in the United States.\n\n\u201cThe military is gone, the press is gone, the intellectuals are gone, civil society is gone and now the businessmen are gone,\u201d said Mr. Schell, who arranged the dinner for Mr. Bannon and has deep ties to China. \u201cIf you\u2019re taking the long view, you\u2019d have to say we\u2019re on diverging pathways.\u201d\n\nBeyond a general spike in tensions, however, the results of this widening divide are difficult to predict, experts and former officials said, because it is occurring against a backdrop of uncertainty in Beijing and Washington.\n\nMr. Xi\u2019s ascension, experts said, reflects not only his formidable power but also China\u2019s economic instability. Markets were rattled by news last week that the Chinese government seized the Anbang Insurance Group, a debt-ridden conglomerate that owns the Waldorf Astoria hotel and once negotiated to invest in a Manhattan skyscraper owned by the family of the president\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s handling of China reflects not only his protectionist trade agenda and America First foreign policy, but also his reluctance to antagonize Mr. Xi personally \u2014 a peculiar deference that prompted the tough questions directed at Mr. Bannon over dinner.\n\nFor all his thunderous criticism of China as an economic predator, Mr. Trump has yet to impose a sweeping trade sanction against it. He declined to label China a currency manipulator last year because he said the timing was bad: Mr. Xi had agreed to help the United States press North Korea to curb its nuclear and missile programs.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cChina, we probably lost $504 billion, last year, on trade,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Monday at a meeting with governors, a day after Mr. Xi\u2019s bid to lead indefinitely became public.

He\u2019s helping us with North Korea.\u201d\n\nStrongman on the Rise\n\nThe White House is preparing tariffs on steel and aluminum that would target China and other exporters. It has conducted an investigation into China\u2019s theft of intellectual property, which could result in restrictions on Chinese investment in the United States and retaliatory measures against its consumer electronics products.\n\nDomestic politics, in a year of midterm elections, may drive Mr. Trump to take a harder line. Democrats, who are historically closer to Mr. Trump on trade than most Republicans, have signaled that they will use the president\u2019s tough-on-China stance against him if he does not act soon.\n\n\u201cNow that it\u2019s clear that President Xi isn\u2019t going anywhere, getting tough on China is even more of an imperative,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. \u201cIf President Trump and Congress don\u2019t crack down on their rapacious trade practices,\u201d he added, \u201cChina will continue eating our lunch for years to come.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But after years of struggling to break into the Chinese markets, suffering the theft of their corporate secrets, many American companies are exhausted.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re hearing businesses that work in China use words like reciprocity and retaliation far more than you ever have,\u201d said Scott Mulhauser, a former chief of staff at the American Embassy in Beijing. \u201cFolks are increasingly frustrated and wrestling with how best to deal with it.\u201d\n\nThe frustration is not across the board: Manufacturers tend to be more fed up than Wall Street, which continues to do lucrative investment-banking business with the Chinese government. Technology companies have soured on China, though the market is so vast that they are still willing to consider concessions they would make nowhere else in the world.\n\nThe Trump administration reflects those fissures. Advisers like Gary D. Cohn, director of the National Economic Council, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who both worked at Goldman Sachs, have persuaded Mr. Trump to hold off on tough trade measures against China in the past.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut there are signs that the White House\u2019s nationalist wing is ascendant. Peter Navarro, an economist whose books include \u201cDeath by China\u201d and \u201cThe Coming China Wars,\u201d is to be promoted, and his ideas seem again in vogue with the president.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn the issue of national security, the administration enshrined a harsher stance toward China in the president\u2019s National Security Strategy. The report characterized China in Cold War-like terms, as a revisionist power that will try \u201cto erode American security and prosperity.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s influence on bastions of higher education has also come under scrutiny. The director of the F.B.I., Christopher A. Wray, testified recently that he believed universities were underestimating the ability of Chinese students to collect valuable national security intelligence. He expressed concern about the Confucius Institute, a global learning network sponsored by the Chinese government, whose expansion has elicited criticism over whether it is a tool to influence public opinion about China.\n\nBy itself, some former officials said, Mr. Xi\u2019s move to stay in power should not augur greater conflict with the United States. He is expected to elevate Wang Qishan to vice president and give him a major role in managing the relationship. And he dispatched a senior economic adviser, Liu He, to Washington this week to meet with the administration. Both men are respected in the United States.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s something inherent in dictatorships and one-man rule that causes clashes with U.S. interests, other than, of course, the conflict in values,\u201d said Jeffrey A. Bader, a former China adviser to President Barack Obama.\n\nFor some China hands, the wave of disillusionment reflects unrealistic hopes about how much China was ever going to converge with the United States. John L. Thornton, a former Goldman Sachs president who has taught at Tsinghua University in Beijing, said that in a chaotic world, the two countries should focus on what unites, rather than what divides, them.\n\n\u201cAt one end of the spectrum is order and at the other end is disorder,\u201d Mr. Thornton said. \u201cChina and the United States are clearly on the same end of the spectrum.\u201d", "keywords": ["conflict", "trade", "states", "tightens", "president", "mr", "gone", "ahead", "grip", "china", "trump", "united", "chinese", "sees", "xi"], "polarity": 0.019759512830165013, "subjectivity": 0.3198749921576008},

The biggest single expenditure of the $17 million it spent in 2017 was the $5.5 million it paid for digital advertising, nearly all of which passed through firms owned by Mr. Parscale.\n\nOther notable expenditures were $3.1 million on legal expenses, $1.5 million on merchandise \u2014 including the red Make America Great Again hats \u2014 and nearly $800,000 on Trump properties, including rent on the campaign\u2019s Trump Tower office space.

When the campaign gave presentations to reporters in the final two weeks of the 2016 campaign, Mr. Parscale used the website 270towin.com to show the path to victory, as opposed to presenting sophisticated models.\n\nThe specifics of Mr. Parscale\u2019s involvement in the Trump campaign, including his tactics to reach voters using social media platforms, has also been of interest to lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Last year, he agreed to meet with the House Intelligence Committee as part of its investigation into Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cI am unaware of any Russian involvement in the digital and data operations of the 2016 Trump presidential campaign,\u201d Mr. Parscale said after he agreed to appear. \u201cThe only collaboration I am aware of in the Trump digital campaign was with staff provided to the campaign by Facebook, Google and Twitter.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump may be itching to hit the campaign trail, where he is happiest, but the White House still has a rail-thin political operation. Despite efforts to hire new staff members, it has struggled for months to catch up to speed. And on Tuesday, the West Wing was set to lose another key aide: Mr. Kushner\u2019s spokesman, Josh Raffel, said he would be departing.\n\nThe 2020 campaign announcement, as is common in Trump world, didn\u2019t quite go off without a hitch: For starters, it initially alarmed ethics experts, who said its description of Mr. Kushner as \u201csenior adviser and assistant to the president, and President Trump\u2019s son-in-law,\u201d was in violation of the Hatch Act, which prohibits political activities by government employees.

International relations, he said, requires respect for local privacy laws.\n\n\u201cNo one disputes that countries across the world believe that they have the sovereignty and the sovereign right to pass their own laws governing the access to emails stored on their soil,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd here we are reaching into their lands and imposing our U.S. position on who gets access to emails on their soil.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Dreeben disputed that. \u201cThere is not an international problem here,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is largely a mirage that Microsoft is seeking to create.\u201d\n\nHe added that there is a fundamental misconception about the dispute. \u201cIt\u2019s not a case about privacy,\u201d he said, as the government must satisfy a high burden to obtain the data it seeks.\n\n\u201cThe government has the gold standard of an instrument to address privacy interests here: a probable-cause-based warrant issued by a judge that describes with particularity what we want,\u201d Mr. Dreeben said. \u201cThat is the hallmark in our domestic system of how privacy interests are addressed.\u201d\n\nA ruling upholding the warrant, Microsoft has warned, would embolden foreign countries to seek the emails of Americans stored in the United States.

He Never Won Them in the First Place                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/27/upshot/trump-losing-college-educated-whites-he-never-won-them-in-the-first-place.html", "text": "Advertisement\n\nTrump Losing College-Educated Whites? He Never Won Them in the First Place New evidence that exit polls are a very flawed vehicle for doing post-election analysis.\n\nAfter Donald J. Trump\u2019s upset victory in the 2016 presidential election, one data point from the network exit polls jumped out at analysts: his two-point win among college-educated white voters.\n\nMany pre-election polls had suggested they would favor Hillary Clinton. And now, more than a year later, polls again show Mr. Trump with striking weakness among well-educated white voters, implying he has alienated many who backed him in 2016.\n\nBut it is increasingly clear that there\u2019s another explanation: The exit polls were wrong. Mr. Trump never won college-educated white voters, and therefore he hasn\u2019t lost nearly as much ground among the group as it seems.\n\nThe exit polls\u2019 overestimate of Mr. Trump\u2019s support among well-educated white voters is symptomatic of the survey\u2019s deeper problem: a tendency to severely underrepresent older, white voters without a college degree. Thanks to an odd methodological quirk in exit polling, this underlying problem ultimately biases the rest of the survey, along with the analysis that follows.\n\nAt this point, there is no question that the exit polls underestimate the number of white working-class voters, especially older ones, by a considerable amount. This is clear in census and voter file data, which are widely preferred as measures of the composition of the electorate by pollsters, academics and analysts.\n\nThe newest evidence comes from a Pew Research study on voter registration files. To my knowledge, it is the first nationally representative probability sample matched to vote history data from the 2016 election. According to the Pew data, 45 percent of 2016 voters were whites without a college degree \u2014 11 percentage points higher than the 34 percent vote share calculated by the exit poll, which is conducted by Edison Research for a consortium of media organizations.\n\nHow could the exit poll be off by so much? In fact, most polls are represented by too many well-educated respondents; most high-quality surveys weight their samples to adequately represent less educated voters. But the exit polls aren\u2019t weighted by education, and so they start and end with far too many well-educated voters. (The exit polls are weighted only by demographic characteristics that the exit poll interviewer can visually identify, like gender, whether someone is African-American, and a rough guess of age; they can\u2019t guess education.)\n\nThis winds up biasing the rest of the survey because the exit polls are weighted to match the actual result of a far less educated country. In general, the exit polls underestimate Republican support, probably in no small part because they overrepresent young, nonwhite and well-educated voters. But this process leaves the underlying educational bias of the sample intact, and the result is that Republican-leaning voters are given more weight to compensate for an electorate that represents Democratic-leaning voting groups.\n\nIn the end, the exit poll overestimates Republican support among most demographic groups, including well-educated white voters, and it overestimates the number of voters from Democratic-leaning voting blocs, like young, nonwhite and well-educated voters.\n\nThose two facts go a long way toward explaining why there were so many Democratic-friendly analyses of voting demographics and polls over the last decade. The exit polling made it seem as if the Republicans, in a diversifying country, could not win with big gains among older, white working-class voters.\n\nAnd if the exit polls overestimate Republican vote share among various demographic groups, then pre-election national polls will seem to show Democrats doing well, since they\u2019re weighted by education and aren\u2019t adjusted to match a result. The exit poll tendency to overestimate Republican vote share will also tend to obscure Republican strength in pre-election polls, like Mr. Trump\u2019s big gains among white voters without a college degree.\n\nOver the last year or so, national media organizations have made a concerted effort to cover those white working-class voters. Some have argued that those efforts have gone too far. But so far there has been little or no movement to better represent white working-class voters in public political data and analysis. Only a handful of state pollsters have begun to weight by education, and the exit polls have not announced any methodological changes intended to remedy these issues either.\n\nThe consequences can be significant. For better or worse, lawmakers and campaigns make policy decisions based on political calculations, and the exit polls play a huge role in shaping how people judge the landscape of American electoral politics. Even Fox News\u2019s Sean Hannity briefly supported comprehensive immigration reform in November 2012, after the exit polls made it seem as though Hispanic voters, not white working-class Midwesterners, decided the election in President Obama\u2019s favor.\n\nOne way to avoid the issue: retire the use of the exit polls in post-election analysis, and make apples-to-apples comparisons between current and older pre-election polls. The most important trends of the 2016 election were more apparent using this approach, including Mr. Trump\u2019s strength among white working-class voters. And today, it would make President Trump seem more resilient among well-educated white voters.\n\nNate Cohn is a domestic correspondent for The Upshot. He covers elections, polling and demographics.

Mr. Yun \u201cis very much in favor of compromise and negotiations, and it seems that his voice is not going to be heard.\u201d\n\nFor the last year and a half, tensions have been building on the Korean Peninsula as both Mr. Trump and Kim Jong-un, North Korea\u2019s leader, have ratcheted up bellicose attacks that seemed to push the United States and the North closer to a confrontation.\n\nThe respite of the Olympics \u2014 to which North Korea sent 22 athletes and an entourage of dignitaries, cheerleaders and musical performers \u2014 along with a break in North Korean missile and nuclear tests since last November raised hopes that tensions were finally easing.\n\nBut no sooner had the North and the United States declared their willingness to talk to each other \u2014 something they have in fact done before \u2014 than it became clear that the two sides remained stubbornly far apart.\n\n\u201cThe North Koreans have always said they would be happy to talk to the United States, and in fact they are eager to come and talk to us \u2014 as one nuclear weapons state to another,\u201d said Ralph Cossa, president of the Pacific Forum at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cAnd the U.S. is willing to talk to the North Koreans if they are prepared to put nuclear weapons on the table. So both sides are willing to talk, but not about the same thing.\u201d\n\nWhile leading the United States delegation to the Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, earlier this month, Vice President Mike Pence planned to secretly meet with a high-level delegation from North Korea, but the North Koreans canceled at the last minute, according to the State Department.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThis is the real challenge with North Korea,\u201d said Mr. Cossa. \u201cIf you try to confront them, they get their backs up and feel they have to be more confrontational back, to show they are not afraid.\u201d\n\n\u201dBut if you make an overture, they see this as a weakness they have to exploit,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd if you offer them the moon and the stars, they say \u2018O.K., we want the sun also.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe United Nations Security Council has imposed increasingly strict sanctions on North Korea over its weapons program, but policing violations can be difficult.

A parent company that terminates a franchise agreement to avoid doing business with a franchisee whose workers are trying to unionize may face legal liability for doing so if it is considered a joint employer.\n\nIn December, the board, with its new Republican majority, took up a case known as Hy-Brand and voted to revert to the pre-2015 standard requiring direct and immediate control.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut that case did not raise any questions that hinged on what standard to apply \u2014 the Obama-era guidelines or the previous ones.

If the more recent case was simply a do-over for the previous case, the inspector general argued, then Mr. Emanuel should have recused himself.\n\nMs. Liebman, the former chairwoman, said the board would presumably be able to try again. But she said it would have to wait for a case raising its own questions about which joint-employer doctrine is correct, rather than simply use any vaguely related case as a pretext for revisiting the Obama-era decision.\n\n\u201cIn some future case, where the issue actually arises and some party is seeking a reversal of Browning-Ferris, where more of a deliberation goes on, that could be another vehicle,\u201d she said, adding that there was less likely to be a conflict for Mr. Emanuel in that instance. \u201cThis is likely just a reprieve.\u201d\n\nFor their part, business groups frustrated with the frequently shifting joint-employer definition argued that it was yet another reason for Congress to settle the issue with legislation.\n\n\u201cThis throws the whole situation back into question for a potentially extended period,\u201d said Matthew Haller, a senior vice president at the International Franchise Association. \u201cOur focus has been \u2014 and remains \u2014 on the need for Congress to provide legislative certainty.\u201d\n\nMr. Haller added that the House had passed such legislation in November and that it was now all the more urgent for the Senate \u201cto step into the breach.\u201d", "keywords": ["boards", "board", "case", "workers", "employer", "franchisee", "standard", "intact", "browningferris", "joint", "mr", "obamaera", "rule", "doover", "company", "labor", "leaves"], "polarity": 0.07975503332646187, "subjectivity": 0.40048100048100055},

They\u2019re fighting tooth and nail to stay alive and be relevant. I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re bad \u2014 sometimes they are. But they\u2019re not sitting there like, \u201cIs this movie good?\u201d They\u2019re like, \u201cIs this movie going to sell blankets?\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of what this season is about \u2014 survival. Me and Hiro never talk about how we\u2019re going to get to Season 7. We\u2019re never worried. If FX canceled us tomorrow, I would be like, \u201cDope.\u201d I really wouldn\u2019t be sad at all. All these people would still be my friends. And we made good things.\n\nBlack popular culture is thriving right now, with \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d \u201cGet Out,\u201d shows like \u201cblack-ish,\u201d \u201cThe Chi,\u201d \u201cInsecure.\u201d How do you make sure to sustain the momentum of this moment for black creators?\n\nSTANFIELD We don\u2019t have to worry about that.\n\nDONALD GLOVER That is not our problem. That is not our job. Our job is to make great things and happen to be black. That\u2019s it.\n\nIs it a moment of actual, lasting change?\n\nHENRY When people say \u201cmoment,\u201d that makes me twitch a little. I don\u2019t want anything to be a moment.

Avenues are finally open.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBecause so many people latched onto the surrealist moments in \u201cAtlanta,\u201d did you feel the need to live up to them?\n\nSTEPHEN GLOVER Instead of chasing the idea of what the people want \u2014 the same thing \u2014 we thought of it as, people were receptive to these crazy ideas, so now we know anything is possible. Our ideas can be even more crazy.\n\nPhoto\n\nYou\u2019ve had a run of great cameos \u2014 Migos, Jaleel White, Katt Williams in the new season. How many people did you have to turn down this time around?\n\nSTEPHEN GLOVER [Laughs] There were a lot of people who wanted to be in this season, of course. But it\u2019s also one of those things where everybody\u2019s saying, \u201cOh yeah, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d And then you\u2019re like, \u201cAll right, be here at this time.\u201d And it\u2019s: \u201cOh, actually \u2026\u201d I remember Chris Rock told me, once people like him start asking to be on the show, don\u2019t let anybody do it.\n\nYou also touched on a lot of sensitive debates in Season 1 \u2014 transgender issues, obviously race, police brutality, gun culture. In this moment, where even someone like Dave Chappelle is getting dragged for certain jokes, did you ever worry about what you can or can\u2019t say?\n\nSTEPHEN GLOVER With our show, we talk about being real. With the Montague episode [a debate over race and gender on a Charlie Rose-like talk show], we were just trying to show a real thing, and it wasn\u2019t about being preachy. It\u2019s just reflecting the world we live in.\n\nDONALD GLOVER To pretend like there is not racism, colorism, sexism, killing, all the worst parts of humanity in that area is doing a disservice to black people and humanity. If you don\u2019t like some of the [expletive] that\u2019s in the show, stop taking music out of our schools, stop making money out of our areas.\n\nI just think that\u2019s a problem millennials have \u2014 things should be this way. [Holds up iPhone] In order for you to even have this phone, a slave had to make it. Confront that. Deal with that. Don\u2019t sit here and be like, we should censor it and make everything beautiful. Because it\u2019s not beautiful out here.\n\nThat\u2019s a white problem, to be honest. I don\u2019t think any black person is watching the show being like, \u201cYou can\u2019t do that.\u201d It\u2019s: \u201cYeah, that\u2019s my uncle.\u201d Or: \u201cYeah, that\u2019s some real [expletive].\u201d I don\u2019t have to clean that up for you.

Though his inquiry is intensely, at times painfully personal, Mr. Wilkerson is above all concerned with unpacking the mechanisms of racial domination. The procedure is akin to performing surgery on a half-conscious subject, or digging up a buried land mine that has lost little of its explosive power.\n\nVideo\n\nThe focus of his excavation is a killing that took place in Dothan, Ala., in 1946, when S.E. Branch, a white shopkeeper, shot Bill Spann, a black man who was in his store. Branch, Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s great-grandfather, was charged with first-degree murder, but no trial was ever held, and the crime faded from memory. Or rather, the memory of it was quietly and systematically suppressed. All that remains are a short newspaper article and a few photographs and home movies of the killer.\n\n\u201cDid You Wonder Who Fired the Gun?\u201d proceeds on several parallel tracks. Mr. Wilkerson returns to Alabama and tries to discover both how Bill Spann died and how he was forgotten. His investigation, accompanied by haunting images of Southern back roads and quiet houses, is punctuated by reminders that Bill Spann\u2019s death is hardly a unique or anomalous event. The names of Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner and other recent victims of racist violence appear onscreen, and two songs of protest loop into the soundtrack: Janelle Mon\u00e1e\u2019s \u201cHell You Talmbout\u201d and Phil Ochs\u2019s \u201cWilliam Moore.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat song, about a white postal worker and civil rights activist murdered on an Alabama highway in 1963, is the source of the film\u2019s title and a part of its wider cultural context. \u201cDid You Wonder Who Fired the Gun?\u201d is a passionately political film, aflame with rage in spite of its director\u2019s measured, ruminative tone of voice. It is also a horror movie, full of specters and silences and a terror that is pervasive, intimate and elusive.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Wilkerson, whose previous films include \u201cAn Injury to One\u201d and \u201cFar From Afghanistan,\u201d dispenses with many of the usual techniques of historical documentary. There are a few on-camera interviews, with neighbors and relatives, but more frequently Mr. Wilkerson narrates encounters that took place off camera. And his sleuthing often leads not to moments of revelation but to dead ends and deeper mysteries. The insertion of clips from \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d provides a chilling and ironic counterpoint to the grim story this movie is telling. S.E. Branch is the opposite of Gregory Peck\u2019s brave and decent Atticus Finch, and the truth about what happened to Bill Spann resists the kind of redemptive, healing conclusion that remains a cornerstone of American racial fantasy.\n\nInstead of consolation, Mr. Wilkerson offers commitment. Instead of idealism, honesty. He doesn\u2019t suppose that his film will solve anything, but there is nonetheless something profoundly useful about the way he confronts past and present manifestations of white supremacy. He links his great-grandfather\u2019s crime to the contemporaneous gang rape of Recy Taylor (the subject of an excellent recent documentary by Nancy Buirski), and uncovers patterns of abuse within his family. He corresponds with a relative who is part of a white nationalist, \u201cSouthern secessionist\u201d group. He notes the way racial injustice dwells in apparently mundane facts. The killer is immortalized in pictures and a well-kept tombstone. His victim has been almost entirely erased from memory, a kind of second death beyond the reach of redress or revenge.", "keywords": ["white", "bill", "supremacy", "memory", "racial", "movie", "review", "reckons", "mr", "gun", "spann", "wonder", "wilkerson", "fired"], "polarity": 0.04540441176470589, "subjectivity": 0.3202205882352941},

But it\u2019s also a powerful place, and a friendly one for travelers. Image Scenes from Montgomery. Clockwise from top right: Students examine the Southern Poverty Law Center\u2019s Civil Rights Memorial, designed by Maya Lin; a Nat King Cole mural on Maxwell Boulevard near downtown, by the artists Sunny Paulk and Corey Spearman; culinary students Sheldon Warren, Steven McIntyre and Felicia Houston hang out at Aviator Bar after work; the Dexter Avenue King Memorial Baptist Church, where Dr. King preached. Credit Jada Yuan/The New York Times\n\nDriving by the Alabama State Capitol building in Montgomery, Michelle Browder, an African-American activist and founder of the I Am More Than... youth mentorship nonprofit, pointed out a looming bronze statue of Jefferson Davis, the first and only president of the Confederacy. It has a position of prominence right out front, as does a commemorative plaque on the marble steps marking the exact spot where he stood taking his oath of office in 1861. A state holiday recognizes his birthday. Farther down the Capitol lawn, Ms. Browder said, was a similar statue heralding Dr. J. Marion Sims, but I didn\u2019t recognize the name, and she wouldn\u2019t elaborate. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to do your homework on that one,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause my blood pressure goes up when I talk about him.\u201d\n\nMs. Browder wore red cat-eye glasses, an Army-green jacket, and a T-shirt bearing the words \u201cDream Destroyed\u201d and the face of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who began leading the Montgomery Bus Boycott in 1955 from the basement of a Baptist church just 440 feet from those Capitol steps. The vehicle she was careening through downtown, often parking akimbo on sidewalks or in the middle of the street, was a six-seat electric cart, from which she leads More Than Tours \u2014 explorations of a city that has been both the site of systemic oppression of her fellow African-Americans and the birthplace of the civil rights movement.\n\nWithin about 10 seconds, she\u2019d risked that blood pressure spike to tell me about Sims. \u201cHe\u2019s known as the father of modern gynecology,\u201d she said. \u201cHe enslaved black women and he used them as experiments.\u201d Specifically, he visited unimaginable tortures on 12 slave women, without anesthesia, under the belief that black people felt less than whites. \u201cWe are starting an initiative,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause we would like to see the mothers of gynecology erected beside him to give more to the story.\u201d The \u201cwe\u201d she refers to is a group she\u2019s organized called Friends of Anarcha, after a woman who endured 30 of Sims\u2019s vaginal surgeries before he declared her a success.\n\nMontgomery was my third stop on an insane yearlong mission I\u2019ve undertaken to visit every spot on The Times\u2019 52 Places to Go in 2018 list, and I was eager to find out why the city had snagged the No. 49 slot. By the end of four days, I\u2019d come to believe it should have ranked higher. As a tourist destination, Montgomery is \u2014 how shall I put this \u2014 heavy. In the same afternoon, visitors can see the Rosa Parks Museum, built at the site of her 1955 arrest for refusing to give up her seat to a white person, and the first White House of the Confederacy, a National Historic Landmark. (Ms. Browder is a descendant of Aurelia Browder, a woman who faced a similar arrest eight months before Parks, and who was the lead plaintiff in the 1956 lawsuit, Browder v. Gayle, that ended the bus boycott.)\n\nThe city is also undeniably relevant right now, with a deep commitment to confronting its past (and often present) of racism, at a time when white supremacism has re-entered the national conversation in a major way. Daily, I found myself moved to tears by any number of tales of brutality or hardship, and the strength it took to tell them. Even the trees that line the streets, dripping with Spanish moss like bearded old men, seem embedded with pain.\n\nI\u2019d arrived in MGM, as residents call it, less than two months after national news outlets had swarmed its streets to document the contentious Senate race in which Doug Jones, a Democrat, defeated Roy S. Moore, the Republican who had been accused of harassing and assaulting teenage girls. \u201cHis office is right there!\u201d Ms. Browder said, pointing to the windows of Mr. Moore\u2019s Foundation for Moral Law, in a building that once housed the bank that funded the Confederacy.\n\nImage A rendering of the National Memorial for Peace and Justice, scheduled to open on April 26. Credit Equal Justice Initiative\n\nWhat really ought to bump Montgomery up the 52 Places list is the National Memorial for Peace and Justice that the Equal Justice Initiative, a human rights legal nonprofit, is scheduled to open on April 26. Inspired by the memorials that Germany, Rwanda and South Africa have built to the atrocities of their own pasts, it pays tribute to the approximately 4,400 black victims of lynching by white mobs in the United States from 1877 to 1950, and is the country\u2019s first comprehensive memorial to racial terrorism.\n\nThe six-acre site and an accompanying museum that aims to link slavery to mass incarceration were under construction when I visited, but plans show it will consist of 800 rectangular, oxidized steel columns, each representing a particular county in the Deep South and Midwest, and bearing the names of the men, women and children killed there. While the columns will appear at first glance to touch the ground, the floor of the memorial will actually slope downward as visitors walk through it, allowing for the columns to hang over them, like bodies.\n\nThe Initiative\u2019s project is in many ways a companion piece to the work that the Southern Poverty Law Center, the nation\u2019s top legal advocate for victims of hate crimes, began in Montgomery with the Civil Rights Memorial in 1989. The memorial, designed by Maya Lin, consists of a stone table overflowing with water, bearing the names of 40 people who were murdered while doing things as simple as registering black people to vote. (A Civil Rights Memorial Center was added in 2005.)\n\nUpon first impression, even with a county population of 230,000, Montgomery seems far too quaint and conservative to be home to two of the country\u2019s most influential, progressive nonprofits fighting racial bias. Its airport has a single baggage claim and the rental car area is dotted with wooden rocking chairs, for an extra dose of Southern charm. I spent 20 minutes answering emails before walking outside and found myself the only person left on the premises, other than three bored-seeming policemen trading stories on the sidewalk.\n\n\u201cYou need a taxi, ma\u2019am?\u201d one of them asked. \u201cHe just left, so it\u2019s going to be 15 or 20 minutes.\u201d \u201cNow, where\u2019s my taxi driver?\u201d the officer mumbled to himself, then got on the radio: \u201cNick, there\u2019s a lady waiting for you.\u201d It took me a minute to absorb what I was hearing, but yes, apparently there was only one taxi driver working in Montgomery on Super Bowl Sunday.\n\nI\u2019d encountered a similar peculiarity earlier that morning, when I\u2019d made a last minute online reservation at a lovely bed-and-breakfast, Red Bluff Cottage, only to receive a distressed call from the owner, Bonnie Ponstein, wondering what time, exactly, I was planning to arrive. She, her husband and their usual housekeeper would all be at church.\n\nThat evening, I went to the city\u2019s historic downtown for an informal tour with an enterprising Lyft driver, Marcus McNeal. We stood talking in the middle of those cobblestone streets for what must have been 30 minutes before another car, or even another person, came by. \u201cYou could shoot a cannon down Dexter Avenue\u201d \u2014 downtown\u2019s main drag \u2014 \u201cand not hit a person on a Sunday,\u201d Barry Ponstein, Bonnie\u2019s husband told me later. \u201cEveryone\u2019s at church.\u201d\n\nThe one person we did meet out and about, actually, was Brother Ricky Segers, whom we found deep into a nightly ritual he\u2019s kept up for three years, of kneeling in front of a tiny souvenir American flag he\u2019s planted on the Capitol grounds to ask Jesus for more \u201cgodly\u201d leaders in this country. He feels as though Roy Moore was \u201cmistreated\u201d and Robert E. Lee was a hero. Still, he and Mr. McNeal, the Lyft driver, who is black and at least half his age, have known each other for a while now and seem to get along great.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s interesting to me, too,\u201d said Mr. McNeal of their friendliness. He\u2019s 24, hopes to open a chain of 24-hour coffee shops for workaholics, and comes from what he described as abject poverty. The car he drove me in belongs to his mother, who has been pulling double shifts as a nurse\u2019s assistant to pay for their heating bill that had gone from $80 to $480 during a cold spell that preceded my visit.\n\n\u201cMy mom is 62 years old and she makes $8 an hour, and that\u2019s the most she\u2019s ever made,\u201d he said. Their all-wood house has too much dry rot for them to install insulation, and they haven\u2019t been able to afford replacing the bathroom sink that fell out of their wall. \u201cIt\u2019s O.K.,\u201d he said. \u201cPoverty is a mind-set. If you change your mind-set, you\u2019re going to come out of it eventually.\u201d Later, he declared, \u201cCome back and see me when I have my Bentley.\u201d\n\nThe ad hoc tour Mr. McNeal took me on had been refreshingly frank. He drove straight to a historical placard describing the bustling slave markets that had been held at Court Square, the city\u2019s central roundabout. I asked Mr. McNeal why it didn\u2019t have more central placement in the square and he just laughed: \u201cWhat else are they going to do? It\u2019s not like they can build an auction platform here. That would really piss some people off!\u201d\n\nWhen I mentioned to him that multiple people had suggested I eat at Central, an upscale Southern food restaurant in downtown\u2019s tiny revitalized commercial district, he joked, \u201cCentral is so expensive, you\u2019d be better off buying a restaurant and opening and stocking the kitchen yourself.\u201d We went to Applebee\u2019s instead, and gorged on spinach and artichoke dip.\n\nI did end up at Central on another night, and it was indeed quite good \u2014 part of a growing culinary scene that will include gourmet offerings at the renovated Kress on Dexter building downtown, which opens in April. The former block-wide department store, built in 1929, will host rotating pop-up markets devoted to local artists \u2014 and has been engaged in incredibly responsible historical preservation, which has included donating bricks made by enslaved people to EJI \u2014 as well as keep its old \u201cWhites Only\u201d and \u201cColored Only\u201d signs on display for posterity. I\u2019m also a fan of the coffee shops Prevail Union and Cafe Louisa, as well as bar standouts like Leroy Lounge, a dive with a terrific selection of wines and craft beers, and Aviator Bar, covered in airplane-themed kitsch \u2014 inspired by the Wright Brothers, who started the country\u2019s first civilian flight school outside Montgomery.\n\nI met a group of black culinary students there one night who not only knew the city\u2019s history but said it fueled their ambitions. \u201cWe\u2019re in a bar on the road that was used to bring people to be auctioned off,\u201d said Steven McIntyre, who interns as a line cook at the highly regarded restaurant Vintage Year, \u201cand the fact that we are here today, just hanging out, enjoying life, it\u2019s incredible. Not super long ago, we would not be chilling here. This would not be chill.\u201d\n\nMy best culinary experiences, though, came by way of cabdrivers I\u2019d met. Nick Alloway, that lone Sunday driver, sent me to Mrs. B\u2019s Home Cooking, a yellow-painted soul food restaurant a few minutes west of downtown that serves up a different featured meat every day. Blocks north of the Capitol building is Davis Cafe, an even older family-run soul food joint that\u2019s the haunt of Hillard Wright, a King\u2019s Airport shuttle driver with a salt-and-pepper mustache, a gruff baritone voice and a leather rancher\u2019s hat that never left his head. He spent a whole afternoon showing me his version of the city he\u2019s lived in all of his 66 years. State senators were crowded into every vinyl booth. My plate overflowing with collard greens, creamed corn, peas and okra, turkey dressing, yams and cornbread cost around $6.\n\nFollowing the spirit of the locals I had met, I tried to absorb as much history as I could in four days: The Dexter Parsonage Museum, where Dr. King lived in the 1950s; the F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald Museum in the home where their marriage dissolved; Hank Williams\u2019s grave in the Oakwood Annex Cemetery. What stuck with me more than any of those, though, were the three hours I spent with Mr. Wright, engaging in his favorite pastime of driving around and looking at old houses. He\u2019d introduce each neighborhood with factoids about its legal, and later, de facto, segregation status. Entering the \u201cold money\u201d neighborhood of Old Cloverdale, for example, he pointed out, \u201cif you\u2019ll notice, you don\u2019t see any black folks living in there.\u201d I did notice.\n\nMr. Wright, though, is not bitter. He has built for himself a quiet life of hunting and fishing, driving around for money and minding his own business. \u201cEven through the segregation and hatred,\u201d he said, \u201cMontgomery, I wouldn\u2019t trade it. I\u2019ve been here my whole life and I\u2019ve enjoyed every day.\u201d\n\nThis year, the city will erect its first statue to Dr. King, in front of the Dexter Avenue King Memorial Baptist Church where he used to preach near the Capitol. The statues of J. Marion Sims and Jefferson Davis, erected in 1939 and 1940, will be in view, too. Alabama will remain one of two states that celebrate the King and Lee birthdays in a combined holiday. This is how change seems to come in Montgomery: messy and long overdue. Still, how wonderful to see progress in action.\n\nJada Yuan will be traveling to every place on this year\u2019s 52 Places to Go list. Her next dispatch will be from Disney Springs, Fla.

I can relate to self-loathing. The reason a person lashes out the way Dixon does is because he hates himself, so anybody can relate to that. I\u2019m drawn to complex characters; they\u2019re all filled with so many different feelings, and that\u2019s what makes them interesting. The first \u201cIron Man,\u201d Tony Stark, was an interesting character. He drinks too much, he\u2019s a womanizer, and then he has this epiphany. That\u2019s what\u2019s interesting.\n\nWhat do you think it was about this role, and this film, that led to so many awards?\n\nIt\u2019s the transformational aspect of it, the fact that he was really many different roles wrapped up in one role. He\u2019s a doofus, he\u2019s a racist, he\u2019s violent, he\u2019s a mama\u2019s boy. There\u2019s a few heroic things at certain points. But he\u2019s very flawed, and it\u2019s a boy-to-man journey.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThere\u2019s been criticism that your character got away scot-free for his racist behavior and for throwing a guy out the window, and never being brought to justice.\n\nIt\u2019s a small town and, who knows, in real life maybe he would have gotten thrown in prison. It\u2019s a sort of dark fairy tale in certain ways \u2014 it\u2019s not necessarily meant to be completely realistic. And if it is meant to be realistic, in real life, things aren\u2019t tied up in a bow. People who deserve to get punished don\u2019t necessarily get punished.\n\nDid it surprise you that there was criticism of the movie along these lines?\n\nNo, whenever a movie is popular and it is a complex dramatic story, I think it\u2019s going to stir up a lot of feelings. A lot of good stuff come out of it \u2014 the billboards that have been popping up [activists recreated versions of the billboards in Miami and London]. That\u2019s kind of incredible, when a movie can effect social change, that\u2019s kind of astounding. I think Mildred [the film\u2019s mother, played by Frances McDormand, who is seeking justice in the murder of her daughter] is a really beautiful working-class wonder woman in some ways. It\u2019s a kind of antihero slash protagonist thing that I think women really need right now. Mildred and [the directors] Greta Gerwig and Patty Jenkins. It\u2019s been an incredibly vibrant year.\n\nYou\u2019re a really good dancer \u2014 you can really bust a move. You did the splits on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d How did that come about? Is it self-taught?\n\nIt\u2019s a long story, but I hung out with a certain crowd, and it was a way to meet girls.\n\nWhat kind of certain crowd?\n\nSan Francisco is not all cable cars and Rice-A-Roni. There were some tough kids there. When I was in middle school, there was a more white supremacist kind of group I didn\u2019t get along with. I got in a lot of fights with them and didn\u2019t win a lot of those fights. I didn\u2019t get along with the rich kids, people we called WPODs: white punks on dope. My school was interracial, and I met a cool group of friends who introduced me to some other friends. I used to do really bad break dancing, when \u201cThriller\u201d and \u201cPurple Rain\u201d came out. I was into Run-DMC, Grandmaster Flash, Doug E. Fresh, Eric B. & Rakim. Probably my biggest inspiration was James Brown, and watching Tom Cruise in \u201cRisky Business.\u201d I remember practicing that, and watching James Brown do the splits. I [recently] did SoulCycle, I\u2019m not proud to say, and Usher was next to me. I thought I had rhythm until I was on a bicycle next to Usher. This is what happens when you go to spinning class in Hollywood.\n\nWere you intimidated working with Frances McDormand?\n\nI think it\u2019s the biggest compliment to Frances that people are asking, \u201cWere you intimidated by her?\u201d Not really, but I was nervous to get in the ring with a great actor. I\u2019ve worked with a lot of great actors. She\u2019s really a force. I think what\u2019s great about her is her integrity. Her sense of truth is like an iron bar. All these people \u2014 Woody [Harrelson, a co-star], Martin [McDonagh, the film\u2019s writer-director], Frances \u2014 are true anarchists, they really are. I think it comes through in their work. I\u2019m not exactly conventional either.\n\nSo your dad posted a comment on that New York Times essay criticizing the film \u2014 he defended you. Was it definitely your dad?\n\nYes that was my father. I didn\u2019t read the article, but they read that quote to me on the Jimmy Kimmel show. That was my dad being a supportive father. He was just looking out for the kid.", "keywords": ["york", "lot", "secret", "kind", "thats", "hes", "break", "bad", "dancer", "really", "actor", "sam", "rockwell", "character", "think", "movie", "past"], "polarity": 0.20883392294682618, "subjectivity": 0.5147564353209513},

While it may not be a common vantage point, the narrative is a natural one for Marilyn Stern, a photographer and graphic artist who is a member of the Metropolitan Postcard Club of New York City.\n\nNot surprisingly, the vast majority of postcards that feature black people in the United States from the 19th and 20th centuries were very racist, she said.\n\n\u201cI was so sick of seeing these horrible racist stereotypes,\u201d said Ms. Stern, a collector since the mid-1970s. \u201cWhenever I came across something that was not racist or not stereotypical, or even went so far as showing romance between the races, I wanted to save it and collect it.\u201d\n\nHer collection, which numbers about 3,000, has about 300 postcards that depict African-American life in all lights.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard for us to fathom how isolated people were, especially in rural areas and isolated small towns before there were telephones and radios,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were postal deliveries three times a day, so it was the internet of the early 1900s.\u201d\n\nPostcards had better printing technology than magazines and newspapers did at the time, as the burst of color in the selection below shows. They could show racism with clarity. \u201cThe idea that you could see images so realistic blew people away,\u201d she said.\n\nMany of the racist postcards were a form of propaganda, she said.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important to see how racism was manifested in the past,\u201d she said, \u201cperhaps to better fight it in the present. You can recognize something if you\u2019ve seen it before.\u201d\n\nBelow is a selection from Ms. Stern\u2019s collection with descriptions based on her research.\n\nTrade Cards\n\nImage\n\nAfrican-Americans were often subjects \u2014 and targets \u2014 of advertising cards that were issued before 1900. These cards were frequently given away in products, or with the purchase of a product.\n\nAbove, an advertisement for J & P Coats thread. Below, a country doctor dispensing Ayer\u2019s Cathartic Pills.\n\nImage\n\nThe Cakewalk\n\nImage\n\nThe Cakewalk, a dance created by plantation slaves as a satire of Southern white society, was the focus of these cards, which featured two black children and an African-American troupe that toured Europe in the late 1800s and early 1900s.\n\nRacist Cards\n\nImage\n\nThe card on the left was shot in a professional studio, but it was labeled \u201cHer Country Cousins.\u201d The implication was that no matter how refined, educated or successful black Americans became, they were still basically savages, Ms. Stern said.\n\nThe two cards on the right were produced in 1905 in New York on the common theme of the delivery stork. The first one, with the caption \u201cComparing Notes,\u201d shows both a black baby and a white baby, with no apparent bias. The second one shows two black babies with the slogan \u201cNo Race Suicide,\u201d implying that a high black birthrate threatened white supremacy, she said.\n\n\u201cLovers of All Nations\u201d\n\nImage\n\nThis postcard was from a series mailed in 1908 that was called \u201cLovers of All Nations.\u201d The banjo was a racial stereotype, but the card is in the non-discriminating \u201cFamily of Man\u201d tradition.\n\nMemories of Slavery\n\nImage\n\nPostcards once served as documentary photography. Some cards honored older African-Americans of the South, who were living memories of slavery. This was part of a series, and it was mailed in 1906.\n\nLife in the Jim Crow South\n\nImage\n\nA fortuneteller with white clients, mailed in 1908.\n\nHoliday Greetings\n\nImage\n\nIdealized country life, in a card mailed in 1907, as Americans flocked to cities.\n\nReligion\n\nImage\n\nA card, likely from the early 1950s, urging parishioners to come to church.\n\nReal Photos\n\nImage\n\nAn unidentified young woman in her graduation cap and gown, in a studio portrait taken between the 1920s and \u201940s. Cards labeled \u201cReal Photo Postcards\u201d are set apart from commercially printed postcards and are actual photographs printed on photographic paper with a preprinted postcard back.\n\nAchievement\n\nImage\n\nThe many important contributions that African-Americans made to society were rarely acknowledged in older postcards, but an exception was made for the scientist and educator George Washington Carver.\n\nHis experiments with peanuts, sweet potatoes and other crops contributed greatly to the economy of the South. This card \u2014 from a photo shot on Kodachrome or Ektachrome film \u2014 is from the late 1950s to mid-60s.\n\nFor more, see Ms. Stern\u2019s postcard blog, and a review of the film Through a Lens Darkly that deals with African-American representation in postcards and photography.

But those seeking to dismiss their stories of pain and demands for equality argued that the payments were proof that their accounts could not be trusted.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cYou get this idea immediately after the war, during these testimonies, that people talking about civil rights are literally getting paid\u201d to tell fabricated stories, Ms. Richardson said.\n\nThat belief spread to other contexts, too.

Alex Bowman, 24, who replaced Earnhardt in the No. 88 car for Hendrick Motorsports, will start the Daytona 500 from the pole position.

A graduate of Nascar\u2019s Drive for Diversity program, Darrell Wallace Jr., 24, could give stock car racing something it has never had before: an African-American star.\n\nBut that is not why Richard Petty brought Wallace onto his team. Late last season, Wallace, who goes by the nickname Bubba, got four rides with Richard Petty Motorsports. It was enough for Petty, one of Nascar\u2019s most iconic names, to not only give Wallace a full-time ride, but also to give him his famed No. 43 racecar to drive. Wallace is the first African-American to drive full-time in the top Nascar series since Wendell Scott in 1971.\n\nPetty insisted, though, that he is colorblind when it comes to evaluating talent. Sure, it would be great if Wallace brings the sport into the African-American community, but as far as Petty is concerned, that\u2019s secondary.\n\n\u201cI hope he advances us as a race team,\u201d Petty said in an email. \u201cI care about what Bubba can do behind the wheel for us. The rest, there are a lot of eyes on Bubba, but he\u2019s handling it well. I know come Sunday he\u2019ll be ready to get into a racecar and just show his talent. If he does well, the rest will come and he\u2019ll grow our fan base.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThose eyes on Wallace, much as they were on Tiger Woods a generation ago, prompted Earnhardt to call him last week.

But there\u2019s also venturing out into a different market, into different avenues where the African-American culture lives. We all have to do better at that.\u201d\n\nThere are challenges, of course. On social media, where vulgar epithets can be spewed from faceless and fictitious monikers, Wallace has, at times, had to think twice before responding. He admits he has not always been successful.\n\n\u201cThere is always going to be haters out there, people who don\u2019t want to see you succeed,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been told that since Day 1 from my parents. Just keep your head down and keep moving, that\u2019s the best you can do.\u201d\n\nBlaney, his closest friend on the circuit, has been around Wallace when offensive remarks have been made.\n\n\u201cThankfully, it\u2019s very, very rare, but it upsets me,\u201d Blaney said. \u201cBubba\u2019s great at handling it. He\u2019s an amazing ambassador for the sport. And he\u2019s really talented and a heck of a competitor. All of us are competitive, but his competitiveness is unlike anyone I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\nNascar\u2019s diversity has become an issue again after its only female racer, Danica Patrick, announced she will retire from the circuit after the Daytona 500. But Wallace is not the only driver who can energize an overlooked community. What he can do for an African-American audience, Su\u00e1rez can do for the Latino market. A native of Monterrey, Mexico, Su\u00e1rez said he had noticed an uptick in social media messages from a variety of Latino countries.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s usually either people who tell me they\u2019re now following the sport because of me, or they\u2019ve been fans and now they have a driver to root for,\u201d said Su\u00e1rez, who is also a graduate of the Drive for Diversity program. \u201cThe potential is huge. This is the most diverse country in the world, but we have to improve diversity in Nascar. If we can make the sport more diverse, we\u2019ll see the same thing with fans.

He worked for the magazine into his 80s.\n\n\u201cBefore the Mayflower\u201d established Mr. Bennett as a leading scholarly voice during the racial ferment of the 1960s.

Townships have gotten electricity and more modern housing. Government contracts have been set aside for black would-be entrepreneurs.\n\nThese programs have had an impact, improving material conditions and generating jobs.\n\nThey have also been riddled with corruption.\n\nPhoto\n\nAt local governments across South Africa, bureaucrats have abused their authority to steer contracts to companies that put cash in their pockets. At every level of society, people have grown accustomed to kickbacks and political connections determining who prospers, and who goes without.\n\nMr. Zuma\u2019s demise resonates as a sign of a potential new order taking shape. He will forever be linked to his association with the Guptas, three Indian-born brothers who effectively bought key levers of governmental power, amassing influence so comprehensive that it became known as \u201cstate capture.\u201d\n\nHis resignation has raised hopes that South Africa is finally contending with its epidemic of corruption. That view gained momentum when an elite police unit raided a home belonging to the Guptas nearly at the same moment that Mr. Ramaphosa was assuming office.\n\nThe new president is a hero of the anti-apartheid struggle, a former deputy president and chairman of the National Planning Commission, a focal point for thinking about how to engineer economic growth. As a former trade union leader and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Mr. Mandela, he enjoys credibility among a range of interest groups, while carrying a reputation as a savvy and strategic operator.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe has had his brushes with controversy, most notably after a 2012 police massacre of striking platinum miners that killed 34 people. At the time, Mr. Ramaphosa occupied a seat on the board of Lonmin, the company that owned the mine. Emails soon surfaced showing that, a day before the police opened fire, Mr. Ramaphosa had been urging senior government officials to take strong action to end the strike.\n\nPhoto\n\nStill, no corruption charges have stuck to the new president, who now claims a mandate to clean up the toxic mess left behind by Mr. Zuma.\n\nSome doubt whether the A.N.C. can be salvaged as an effective vehicle for egalitarian policymaking. The party\u2019s executive ranks include many figures implicated in corruption. Mr. Ramaphosa, 65, may champion new initiatives aimed at generating economic growth, yet he finds himself relying on his party brethren to execute his visions, with no certainty that the money will land where intended.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t necessarily think that taking the president out does much to dismantle the patronage network,\u201d said Ayabonga Cawe, a development economist at Xesibe Holdings, a research and advisory firm in Johannesburg. \u201cYou\u2019re going to need a lot more than taking out the guy at the top.\u201d\n\nAbove all, Mr. Ramaphosa must contend with the structural defects that have long constrained South Africa\u2019s economy, a legacy of apartheid.\n\nBeyond its systemic discrimination against black people, apartheid severed the country from much of the global economy. It ensured that huge numbers of uneducated black South Africans were available at poverty-level wages within major sectors of the economy like mining, agriculture and textiles. That cushioned domestic companies from the pressure to modernize.\n\nPhoto\n\nInternational sanctions isolated South Africa, shielding its firms from competition against multinational rivals. Sanctions also denied South African companies the ability to operate abroad, giving them an incentive to focus on the domestic market. The apartheid-era government obliged with subsidies for favored firms while allowing companies to pursue oligopoly, free of nuisances like antitrust law.\n\nThe result was a system in which large industries, from retail to furniture-making to chemicals, were dominated by huge enterprises whose core strength was the ability to protect themselves against competition.

The aggressive pace of deportations of immigrants of color, the elimination of the DACA program protecting immigrant children and the proposals propounded by the anti-immigration voices in the administration will all have the undeniable effect of slowing the rapid racial diversification of the United States population. Despite this sweeping attempt at racial social engineering, few voices in progressive and Democratic circles are responding with the kinds of outrage that one would expect.\n\nThe pro-white preferences of Donald Trump and his administration, especially when it comes to immigration, are legion. From the day he opened his presidential campaign in 2015 by demonizing Mexicans to the enthusiasm generated by the calls for building a wall along the Mexican border to aggressively ramping up deportations of immigrants of color to eliminating DACA to vulgarly denigrating African nations and Haiti, this administration has been quite clear about its preference for white people.\n\nIt should be no surprise, then, that the immigration policies championed by the White House would all have the effect of reducing the number of people of color coming into the country. A recent study by The Washington Post found that the administration\u2019s proposals to curtail legal immigration by limiting family reunification would slightly delay the date when whites become a minority. \u201cBy greatly slashing the number of Hispanic and black African immigrants entering America, this proposal would reshape the future United States,\u201d the economist Michael Clemens said.\n\n\u201cDecades ahead,\u201d he added, \u201cmany fewer of us would be nonwhite or have nonwhite people in our families.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe administration\u2019s focus is not random. Nor is it illogical, if one\u2019s goal is to maximize the influence of white people. Since the passage of the 1965 Immigration and Naturalization Act, the chromatic composition of the country\u2019s population has undergone a fundamental transformation. People of color used to make up 12 percent of the United States population in 1965, and that percentage has more than tripled over the past several decades to the point where nonwhite people are nearly 39 percent of the residents of the United States (it is no accident that the country\u2019s first African-American president was elected when he was elected). Mr. Trump\u2019s team understands that the specific laws it seeks to eliminate have played a significant role in that demographic revolution.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

The very first immigration law passed, the Naturalization Act of 1790, declared that to become a citizen, one had to be a \u201cfree white person.\u201d That demarcation was the explicit law of the land for the next 162 years, until 1952. There are 20th-century Supreme Court cases explicitly holding that Asian immigrants could not become United States citizens because they were not white. Even after 1952, the practical effect of immigration policy continued to promote white people above others through mechanisms such as the Asia Pacific Triangle, which restricted immigration from Asian countries.", "keywords": ["white", "sign", "states", "color", "effect", "america", "immigrants", "immigration", "wants", "nonwhite", "united", "trump", "population"], "polarity": 0.07678771845438513, "subjectivity": 0.2882194965528299},

Almost all of those who led the campaign to bring him to account were black, like Thuli Madonsela, the former public protector, who played a heroic role in exposing Mr. Zuma\u2019s corruption. South Africa\u2019s judiciary, which is majority black, defended the independence of the courts with extraordinary courage and under great pressure. After this display of black courage, why would it matter what white people think?\n\nBut South Africa is too fraught and complex a place for such a simple story to ring true. More plausible is that each pinprick penetrating Mr. Zuma\u2019s skin is felt by black South Africans, even those who are horrified by what he has done.\n\nBeneath the surface of public life, one can detect a strange, subliminal to-and-fro. Last year, for instance, a superb book describing in meticulous detail the deep corruption of the late apartheid years, \u201cApartheid Guns and Money,\u201d by Hennie van Vuuren, was a runaway best seller. It deserved to be widely read, but the scale of its success is partly a function of its utility as a weapon against white arrogance. \u201cHowever bad Zuma is,\u201d its many black readers could say to themselves, \u201cyou people were worse.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

For the truth is that Mr. Zuma and his allies were corrupt partly because they felt a sense of grievance intimately connected to their experience of race.\n\nWhen Mr. Zuma became president of South Africa in 2009, he rallied behind him an alliance of people who felt themselves to be marginal and neglected, not just in relation to the world economic order or white South Africa but also in relation to the A.N.C. itself. The A.N.C. has been run by people drawn from the ranks of an urbane, cosmopolitan elite.\n\nMr. Zuma represented a dramatic change in this tradition. Although he spent years in exile and climbed the ranks of the A.N.C., his biography was unlike any of his predecessors\u2019. Nelson Mandela was born into royalty. Thabo Mbeki was the son of prominent intellectuals. Mr. Zuma\u2019s mother worked in the kitchen of a white family and was too poor to provide her son with a formal education. He grew up herding cattle in the hinterland.\n\nWhen he came to power in 2009, he did so with the support of organizations representing much of the urban working class \u2014 the country\u2019s largest trade union and the South African Communist Party.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut he soon dropped these organizations and turned for support to rural South Africa, in particular to traditional leaders and to the elites of far-flung provincial capitals. They carried with them into power an abiding sense of powerlessness, a feeling that the very institutions they now controlled were alien and belonged to others. In office, they believed that they had entered into their enemy\u2019s mansion. It seemed to be payback time.\n\nIn a speech delivered to a room of black businesspeople in December 2016, Mr. Zuma warned of the sophisticated ways in which the enemy confuses black people. One source of such confusion was the prevailing economic orthodoxy. Mr. Zuma suggested that the most fundamental of economic laws was merely nominal; remove the scales from our eyes and we see that so-called economic laws are a ruse invented by the powerful.\n\nHis genre of criminality is light-years from the sort that characterized the apartheid state. The corruption of apartheid\u2019s leaders stemmed from arrogance; they believed that they could control the world forever. Mr. Zuma\u2019s corruption stems from the grievances of a man who feels very small.\n\nThis sense of grievance was on display in the last words he uttered publicly as president. In a swipe at his successor, Mr. Ramaphosa, Mr. Zuma suggested that those in the party who had unseated him were \u201cserving the interests of the oppressors of yesteryear, who joyfully celebrate as we lynch one another.\u201d\n\nBlack nationalism in South Africa has many faces. Mr. Ramaphosa represents a strand that is bourgeois, worldly and comfortable with power. There is also a militant, socialist strand of black nationalism, but it is on the wane. And there is the strand represented by Mr. Zuma, who governed as a man shaped and distorted by the violence and oppression of white supremacy.\n\nI am of course alive to the irony of a white South African like me saying that a black president\u2019s corruption was motivated by racial grievance. Many South Africans, black and white, would regard this argument as an excuse for the intolerable. But we should be honest enough to accept that even now, notwithstanding that apartheid has been gone since before nearly half the South African population was born, the legacy of white supremacy has lived on in the man who was president.", "keywords": ["white", "distinctive", "south", "economic", "zuma", "mr", "whats", "corruption", "zumas", "mess", "jacob", "africa", "apartheid", "black"], "polarity": 0.0616115067727971, "subjectivity": 0.37158776707163793},

Evenly lit, crisply photographed, they look like pictures from an illustrated medical dictionary, indexical images of heads, torsos and mouths that are detached from context. Even in a work like \u201cFigure\u201d (1991), the figure in question, sheathed in a black dress and set in the black infinity of no particular place, feels like a fragment, as though she had been extracted from a group photo or a furnished room. The texts accompanying her, eight engraved plastic plaques, read like excerpts from a language primer: \u201cfigured the worst,\u201d \u201che was disfigured,\u201d \u201cfigured there would be no reaction\u201d and so on. Here, not only has the story been winnowed down; it is in fact completely gone. There\u2019s no story. We are left with only the tensions of concrete poetry.\n\nSometime in the mid-1990s, Simpson began to detect clich\u00e9d responses to her work. At the same time, her own thinking was evolving. What does an image of a black woman mean? A commentary on race? An assertion about gender? Simpson branched out from figure-based images and began to experiment more with varied subject matter \u2014 landscapes and inanimate objects like wigs \u2014 and also with unusual quasi-sculptural material like felt and standing screens. A series of monumental multisectional images, several of them landscapes, collectively titled \u201cPublic Sex\u201d (1995-1998) and featuring no figures at all, addressed the provocative title only obliquely. These pictures, made over many years, contain what the scholar and curator Okwui Enwezor calls \u201cthe rumor of the body.\u201d Mysteries of a jagged and deadpan sort, they would go on to influence the noirish tone of Simpson\u2019s later film work.\n\nPhoto\n\nSimpson began to set ever more intricate conceptual layers between her initial inspiration for a work and the finished product. The idea for \u201c9 Props\u201d (1995) began during a residency at the Pilchuck Glass School in Washington. With the aid of artisans at the school, she fabricated a series of dark vessels modeled on vases and other objects used in the portrait work of the pioneering Harlem photographer James Van Der Zee. But these vessels were not the final work. She shipped them back to New York and then photographed them against a plain background. And that still was not the work. Further intervention followed: She turned those photographic images into nine lithographs, which she printed on felt. Finally, she wrote captions below each lithographed vessel, describing the context in which it originally appeared. One of them, for instance, reads:\n\nDinner Party with boxer Harry Wills, 1926 James VanDerZee Harry Wills a k a \u201cThe Black Panther,\u201d boxer, businessman- sits with seven other men and women, mostly women with champagne glasses raised as a woman on his left makes a toast in his honor. There are three bottles of champagne, a crystal decanter, a bottle of port, an arrangement of flowers and fruit, and before each guest an untouched china place setting.\n\nPhoto\n\nFrom multiple directions, the work gestures at what cannot be seen: the original placement of the vessels that inspired Simpson\u2019s own, the people in the photographs by James Van Der Zee, the social life of Harlem evoked by his photographs and the complexity of manners and class implied by them. All that vanished world of culture and experience is reduced to an elegant grid, as simple as an antiquarian\u2019s catalog, a thought picture that demands calm engagement and imaginative intervention on the viewer\u2019s part. Without being representational, it is about race; but race is not off in some category by itself, hemmed in only by questions of skin color, separate from life.\n\n\u201cRepresent!\u201d in the black American sense means standing up for your people, expressing solidarity and letting a shared ethos underwrite your presence and work. It is an exhortation, a greeting and a farewell. The word also has more conventional associations. In the visual arts, it is contrasted with the abstract or the symbolic. To represent, in this more common sense, is to make work that visually corresponds to realities out there in the world: to illustrate uncomplicatedly. This second sense of \u201crepresent\u201d is enjoying a vogue in the art world. Realism is back. This is welcome: after so long an absence of black figures and black faces in art museums, they are now being seen more frequently. Many artists, black and otherwise, are depicting the black body. It is necessary and often successful. Just as often, it fails when it is little more than a clumsy shorthand for socially concerned art, unobjectionable and unimpressive.\n\nA strong appeal of Simpson\u2019s work is that she has always embraced the inherent complexity of blackness, her own blackness as well as the blackness that runs ineluctably through American history. She does not reject representational depictions, but neither does she feel the need to confine herself only to \u201crace\u201d work. When an artist uses a black model, she is presenting a human question by foregrounding a human presence. Is a white man a person while a black woman is and can only be a gendered and racialized subject? As the scholar Kellie Jones has pointed out, nonwhite bodies are often thought of as \u201cnot neutral enough for the dispassionate formulas thought to constitute conceptual practice.\u201d If a black woman\u2019s race and gender are the only things apparent to certain viewers, Simpson seems to say, the ethical responsibility to escape those shackles is the viewer\u2019s.\n\nFreedom is Lorna Simpson\u2019s starting point and her permanent theme. A humane current animates all of her work, a current that neither sidesteps nor confines itself to race. Her work is simultaneously about the \u201cneutral\u201d space of ideas and the particularized experience of the body. \u201cMontage\u201d is photographic and painterly, a riff on a pair of found photographs, sequenced to look like a giant strip of film. It deals with dreams and nightmares, ambiguities and vulnerabilities. At its heart is what Simpson calls \u201cthe push and pull of photography\u201d: the stuttering potential inherent in mechanical reproduction and the imperfect registrations that mirror subconscious life. It is a rapid response to the current political climate, situating a crucial part of it in the most intimate space of all, where the hectoring \u201cthey\u201d is temporarily held at bay in favor of the puzzled \u201cI.\u201d In your own sleeping bed, images persist and words are hard to come by. It is the art we need now: rich, allusive, tongue-tied and unanswerable.", "keywords": ["art", "race", "simpsons", "began", "world", "evoking", "work", "seen", "simpson", "images", "black", "woman", "cant"], "polarity": 0.06682087932087931, "subjectivity": 0.4861752986752985},

To some extent, there\u2019s always been an adversarial role between the White House and reporters. How do you feel about the tenor of things now? It used to be friendly-adversarial. There would be retaliation for stories they didn\u2019t like, but nothing compared with this. There\u2019s a war going on.

This is a key piece that I don\u2019t think people really get: When you talk about the press, it\u2019s not about journalists; it\u2019s about the free-flowing information that the American public is supposed to get. When you bash the press, you\u2019re bashing the idea of getting truth out.\n\nWhat\u2019s the public opinion of the White House press corps? It depends on whom you talk to. We\u2019re so tribal now. There used to be a day when you didn\u2019t know the person\u2019s politics. The line has been obscured between facts and opinion.

I really get into those briefings. I really try to listen. I don\u2019t play to the camera. I go in there, and I\u2019m really earnest. So when she said that, I was shocked! I was like, No, God, that was a little bit much.\n\nGiven how much you tangle with this particular administration, why do you think you get called on so much? Have you felt like a target? Yes, I have. But I have to shake that off, because I have to go in and do my job. I cover the White House. I cover all issues, particularly those that affect black and brown Americans.

It\u2019s not been one thing. It\u2019s been a pattern. So I asked. He did not answer, which I thought was a wasted moment.

He is completing \u201cRise of the Black Panther,\u201d a six-part comic series for Marvel that traces the character\u2019s early history. He has tried to explain some of that history to his 7-year-old daughter, but without delving too deeply into complex concepts like Western imperialism, which she may struggle to grasp.\n\n\u201cYou want that white kid to be able to think that he can dress up in a Black Panther costume, because, to that kid, there\u2019s no difference between Captain America and Black Panther,\u201d Mr. Narcisse, 45, said. But, he added, it also involves \u201ctrying to explain what is special about T\u2019Challa and Wakanda without racism. And it\u2019s like, \u2018Can\u2019t do it.\u2019 I couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAccording to the ticketing site Fandango, \u201cBlack Panther\u201d set a record among Marvel films for the most advance tickets sold in a 24-hour period. It\u2019s projected to make a record-breaking $165 million over Presidents\u2019 Day weekend and comparisons to last year\u2019s \u201cWonder Woman\u201d bode well for its reception and impact, particularly for black people.\n\n\u201cWhite people have the privilege of not constantly being reminded of their race in the United States, where white is the majority, whereas as a black person you don\u2019t,\u201d Ms. Vittrup said. She believes that parents in general, and white parents in particular, are reluctant to talk about race with young children. When they do, they often miss the chance to talk about inequality, even though research supports the idea that children develop an awareness of race and difference at a very young age.\n\nMs. Vittrup was careful to add that dressing as Black Panther isn\u2019t inherently appropriative or offensive. The character comes from an invented African country, and to wear his mask isn\u2019t quite the same as wearing blackface. However, in a moment where even more black heroes, like Luke Cage and Black Lightning, are finding their way into the limelight, Black Panther\u2019s relationship with the black community and its history creates an opportunity to teach nonblack children about the black experience.\n\n\u201cKids are not colorblind,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of structural inequality in our society, and kids are noticing that. By not mentioning it, by not talking about it, we\u2019re essentially preserving the status quo.\u201d", "keywords": ["white", "york", "race", "characters", "panthers", "mask", "dress", "think", "meanings", "panther", "black", "history", "kid"], "polarity": 0.05700972543438296, "subjectivity": 0.3779504437723616},

Though his inquiry is intensely, at times painfully personal, Mr. Wilkerson is above all concerned with unpacking the mechanisms of racial domination. The procedure is akin to performing surgery on a half-conscious subject, or digging up a buried land mine that has lost little of its explosive power.\n\nVideo\n\nThe focus of his excavation is a killing that took place in Dothan, Ala., in 1946, when S.E. Branch, a white shopkeeper, shot Bill Spann, a black man who was in his store. Branch, Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s great-grandfather, was charged with first-degree murder, but no trial was ever held, and the crime faded from memory. Or rather, the memory of it was quietly and systematically suppressed. All that remains are a short newspaper article and a few photographs and home movies of the killer.\n\n\u201cDid You Wonder Who Fired the Gun?\u201d proceeds on several parallel tracks. Mr. Wilkerson returns to Alabama and tries to discover both how Bill Spann died and how he was forgotten. His investigation, accompanied by haunting images of Southern back roads and quiet houses, is punctuated by reminders that Bill Spann\u2019s death is hardly a unique or anomalous event. The names of Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner and other recent victims of racist violence appear onscreen, and two songs of protest loop into the soundtrack: Janelle Mon\u00e1e\u2019s \u201cHell You Talmbout\u201d and Phil Ochs\u2019s \u201cWilliam Moore.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat song, about a white postal worker and civil rights activist murdered on an Alabama highway in 1963, is the source of the film\u2019s title and a part of its wider cultural context. \u201cDid You Wonder Who Fired the Gun?\u201d is a passionately political film, aflame with rage in spite of its director\u2019s measured, ruminative tone of voice. It is also a horror movie, full of specters and silences and a terror that is pervasive, intimate and elusive.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Wilkerson, whose previous films include \u201cAn Injury to One\u201d and \u201cFar From Afghanistan,\u201d dispenses with many of the usual techniques of historical documentary. There are a few on-camera interviews, with neighbors and relatives, but more frequently Mr. Wilkerson narrates encounters that took place off camera. And his sleuthing often leads not to moments of revelation but to dead ends and deeper mysteries. The insertion of clips from \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d provides a chilling and ironic counterpoint to the grim story this movie is telling. S.E. Branch is the opposite of Gregory Peck\u2019s brave and decent Atticus Finch, and the truth about what happened to Bill Spann resists the kind of redemptive, healing conclusion that remains a cornerstone of American racial fantasy.\n\nInstead of consolation, Mr. Wilkerson offers commitment. Instead of idealism, honesty. He doesn\u2019t suppose that his film will solve anything, but there is nonetheless something profoundly useful about the way he confronts past and present manifestations of white supremacy. He links his great-grandfather\u2019s crime to the contemporaneous gang rape of Recy Taylor (the subject of an excellent recent documentary by Nancy Buirski), and uncovers patterns of abuse within his family. He corresponds with a relative who is part of a white nationalist, \u201cSouthern secessionist\u201d group. He notes the way racial injustice dwells in apparently mundane facts. The killer is immortalized in pictures and a well-kept tombstone. His victim has been almost entirely erased from memory, a kind of second death beyond the reach of redress or revenge.", "keywords": ["white", "bill", "supremacy", "memory", "racial", "movie", "review", "reckons", "mr", "gun", "spann", "wonder", "wilkerson", "fired"], "polarity": 0.04540441176470589, "subjectivity": 0.3202205882352941},

But it\u2019s also a powerful place, and a friendly one for travelers. Image Scenes from Montgomery. Clockwise from top right: Students examine the Southern Poverty Law Center\u2019s Civil Rights Memorial, designed by Maya Lin; a Nat King Cole mural on Maxwell Boulevard near downtown, by the artists Sunny Paulk and Corey Spearman; culinary students Sheldon Warren, Steven McIntyre and Felicia Houston hang out at Aviator Bar after work; the Dexter Avenue King Memorial Baptist Church, where Dr. King preached. Credit Jada Yuan/The New York Times\n\nDriving by the Alabama State Capitol building in Montgomery, Michelle Browder, an African-American activist and founder of the I Am More Than... youth mentorship nonprofit, pointed out a looming bronze statue of Jefferson Davis, the first and only president of the Confederacy. It has a position of prominence right out front, as does a commemorative plaque on the marble steps marking the exact spot where he stood taking his oath of office in 1861. A state holiday recognizes his birthday. Farther down the Capitol lawn, Ms. Browder said, was a similar statue heralding Dr. J. Marion Sims, but I didn\u2019t recognize the name, and she wouldn\u2019t elaborate. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to do your homework on that one,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause my blood pressure goes up when I talk about him.\u201d\n\nMs. Browder wore red cat-eye glasses, an Army-green jacket, and a T-shirt bearing the words \u201cDream Destroyed\u201d and the face of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who began leading the Montgomery Bus Boycott in 1955 from the basement of a Baptist church just 440 feet from those Capitol steps. The vehicle she was careening through downtown, often parking akimbo on sidewalks or in the middle of the street, was a six-seat electric cart, from which she leads More Than Tours \u2014 explorations of a city that has been both the site of systemic oppression of her fellow African-Americans and the birthplace of the civil rights movement.\n\nWithin about 10 seconds, she\u2019d risked that blood pressure spike to tell me about Sims. \u201cHe\u2019s known as the father of modern gynecology,\u201d she said. \u201cHe enslaved black women and he used them as experiments.\u201d Specifically, he visited unimaginable tortures on 12 slave women, without anesthesia, under the belief that black people felt less than whites. \u201cWe are starting an initiative,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause we would like to see the mothers of gynecology erected beside him to give more to the story.\u201d The \u201cwe\u201d she refers to is a group she\u2019s organized called Friends of Anarcha, after a woman who endured 30 of Sims\u2019s vaginal surgeries before he declared her a success.\n\nMontgomery was my third stop on an insane yearlong mission I\u2019ve undertaken to visit every spot on The Times\u2019 52 Places to Go in 2018 list, and I was eager to find out why the city had snagged the No. 49 slot. By the end of four days, I\u2019d come to believe it should have ranked higher. As a tourist destination, Montgomery is \u2014 how shall I put this \u2014 heavy. In the same afternoon, visitors can see the Rosa Parks Museum, built at the site of her 1955 arrest for refusing to give up her seat to a white person, and the first White House of the Confederacy, a National Historic Landmark. (Ms. Browder is a descendant of Aurelia Browder, a woman who faced a similar arrest eight months before Parks, and who was the lead plaintiff in the 1956 lawsuit, Browder v. Gayle, that ended the bus boycott.)\n\nThe city is also undeniably relevant right now, with a deep commitment to confronting its past (and often present) of racism, at a time when white supremacism has re-entered the national conversation in a major way. Daily, I found myself moved to tears by any number of tales of brutality or hardship, and the strength it took to tell them. Even the trees that line the streets, dripping with Spanish moss like bearded old men, seem embedded with pain.\n\nI\u2019d arrived in MGM, as residents call it, less than two months after national news outlets had swarmed its streets to document the contentious Senate race in which Doug Jones, a Democrat, defeated Roy S. Moore, the Republican who had been accused of harassing and assaulting teenage girls. \u201cHis office is right there!\u201d Ms. Browder said, pointing to the windows of Mr. Moore\u2019s Foundation for Moral Law, in a building that once housed the bank that funded the Confederacy.\n\nImage A rendering of the National Memorial for Peace and Justice, scheduled to open on April 26. Credit Equal Justice Initiative\n\nWhat really ought to bump Montgomery up the 52 Places list is the National Memorial for Peace and Justice that the Equal Justice Initiative, a human rights legal nonprofit, is scheduled to open on April 26. Inspired by the memorials that Germany, Rwanda and South Africa have built to the atrocities of their own pasts, it pays tribute to the approximately 4,400 black victims of lynching by white mobs in the United States from 1877 to 1950, and is the country\u2019s first comprehensive memorial to racial terrorism.\n\nThe six-acre site and an accompanying museum that aims to link slavery to mass incarceration were under construction when I visited, but plans show it will consist of 800 rectangular, oxidized steel columns, each representing a particular county in the Deep South and Midwest, and bearing the names of the men, women and children killed there. While the columns will appear at first glance to touch the ground, the floor of the memorial will actually slope downward as visitors walk through it, allowing for the columns to hang over them, like bodies.\n\nThe Initiative\u2019s project is in many ways a companion piece to the work that the Southern Poverty Law Center, the nation\u2019s top legal advocate for victims of hate crimes, began in Montgomery with the Civil Rights Memorial in 1989. The memorial, designed by Maya Lin, consists of a stone table overflowing with water, bearing the names of 40 people who were murdered while doing things as simple as registering black people to vote. (A Civil Rights Memorial Center was added in 2005.)\n\nUpon first impression, even with a county population of 230,000, Montgomery seems far too quaint and conservative to be home to two of the country\u2019s most influential, progressive nonprofits fighting racial bias. Its airport has a single baggage claim and the rental car area is dotted with wooden rocking chairs, for an extra dose of Southern charm. I spent 20 minutes answering emails before walking outside and found myself the only person left on the premises, other than three bored-seeming policemen trading stories on the sidewalk.\n\n\u201cYou need a taxi, ma\u2019am?\u201d one of them asked. \u201cHe just left, so it\u2019s going to be 15 or 20 minutes.\u201d \u201cNow, where\u2019s my taxi driver?\u201d the officer mumbled to himself, then got on the radio: \u201cNick, there\u2019s a lady waiting for you.\u201d It took me a minute to absorb what I was hearing, but yes, apparently there was only one taxi driver working in Montgomery on Super Bowl Sunday.\n\nI\u2019d encountered a similar peculiarity earlier that morning, when I\u2019d made a last minute online reservation at a lovely bed-and-breakfast, Red Bluff Cottage, only to receive a distressed call from the owner, Bonnie Ponstein, wondering what time, exactly, I was planning to arrive. She, her husband and their usual housekeeper would all be at church.\n\nThat evening, I went to the city\u2019s historic downtown for an informal tour with an enterprising Lyft driver, Marcus McNeal. We stood talking in the middle of those cobblestone streets for what must have been 30 minutes before another car, or even another person, came by. \u201cYou could shoot a cannon down Dexter Avenue\u201d \u2014 downtown\u2019s main drag \u2014 \u201cand not hit a person on a Sunday,\u201d Barry Ponstein, Bonnie\u2019s husband told me later. \u201cEveryone\u2019s at church.\u201d\n\nThe one person we did meet out and about, actually, was Brother Ricky Segers, whom we found deep into a nightly ritual he\u2019s kept up for three years, of kneeling in front of a tiny souvenir American flag he\u2019s planted on the Capitol grounds to ask Jesus for more \u201cgodly\u201d leaders in this country. He feels as though Roy Moore was \u201cmistreated\u201d and Robert E. Lee was a hero. Still, he and Mr. McNeal, the Lyft driver, who is black and at least half his age, have known each other for a while now and seem to get along great.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s interesting to me, too,\u201d said Mr. McNeal of their friendliness. He\u2019s 24, hopes to open a chain of 24-hour coffee shops for workaholics, and comes from what he described as abject poverty. The car he drove me in belongs to his mother, who has been pulling double shifts as a nurse\u2019s assistant to pay for their heating bill that had gone from $80 to $480 during a cold spell that preceded my visit.\n\n\u201cMy mom is 62 years old and she makes $8 an hour, and that\u2019s the most she\u2019s ever made,\u201d he said. Their all-wood house has too much dry rot for them to install insulation, and they haven\u2019t been able to afford replacing the bathroom sink that fell out of their wall. \u201cIt\u2019s O.K.,\u201d he said. \u201cPoverty is a mind-set. If you change your mind-set, you\u2019re going to come out of it eventually.\u201d Later, he declared, \u201cCome back and see me when I have my Bentley.\u201d\n\nThe ad hoc tour Mr. McNeal took me on had been refreshingly frank. He drove straight to a historical placard describing the bustling slave markets that had been held at Court Square, the city\u2019s central roundabout. I asked Mr. McNeal why it didn\u2019t have more central placement in the square and he just laughed: \u201cWhat else are they going to do? It\u2019s not like they can build an auction platform here. That would really piss some people off!\u201d\n\nWhen I mentioned to him that multiple people had suggested I eat at Central, an upscale Southern food restaurant in downtown\u2019s tiny revitalized commercial district, he joked, \u201cCentral is so expensive, you\u2019d be better off buying a restaurant and opening and stocking the kitchen yourself.\u201d We went to Applebee\u2019s instead, and gorged on spinach and artichoke dip.\n\nI did end up at Central on another night, and it was indeed quite good \u2014 part of a growing culinary scene that will include gourmet offerings at the renovated Kress on Dexter building downtown, which opens in April. The former block-wide department store, built in 1929, will host rotating pop-up markets devoted to local artists \u2014 and has been engaged in incredibly responsible historical preservation, which has included donating bricks made by enslaved people to EJI \u2014 as well as keep its old \u201cWhites Only\u201d and \u201cColored Only\u201d signs on display for posterity. I\u2019m also a fan of the coffee shops Prevail Union and Cafe Louisa, as well as bar standouts like Leroy Lounge, a dive with a terrific selection of wines and craft beers, and Aviator Bar, covered in airplane-themed kitsch \u2014 inspired by the Wright Brothers, who started the country\u2019s first civilian flight school outside Montgomery.\n\nI met a group of black culinary students there one night who not only knew the city\u2019s history but said it fueled their ambitions. \u201cWe\u2019re in a bar on the road that was used to bring people to be auctioned off,\u201d said Steven McIntyre, who interns as a line cook at the highly regarded restaurant Vintage Year, \u201cand the fact that we are here today, just hanging out, enjoying life, it\u2019s incredible. Not super long ago, we would not be chilling here. This would not be chill.\u201d\n\nMy best culinary experiences, though, came by way of cabdrivers I\u2019d met. Nick Alloway, that lone Sunday driver, sent me to Mrs. B\u2019s Home Cooking, a yellow-painted soul food restaurant a few minutes west of downtown that serves up a different featured meat every day. Blocks north of the Capitol building is Davis Cafe, an even older family-run soul food joint that\u2019s the haunt of Hillard Wright, a King\u2019s Airport shuttle driver with a salt-and-pepper mustache, a gruff baritone voice and a leather rancher\u2019s hat that never left his head. He spent a whole afternoon showing me his version of the city he\u2019s lived in all of his 66 years. State senators were crowded into every vinyl booth. My plate overflowing with collard greens, creamed corn, peas and okra, turkey dressing, yams and cornbread cost around $6.\n\nFollowing the spirit of the locals I had met, I tried to absorb as much history as I could in four days: The Dexter Parsonage Museum, where Dr. King lived in the 1950s; the F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald Museum in the home where their marriage dissolved; Hank Williams\u2019s grave in the Oakwood Annex Cemetery. What stuck with me more than any of those, though, were the three hours I spent with Mr. Wright, engaging in his favorite pastime of driving around and looking at old houses. He\u2019d introduce each neighborhood with factoids about its legal, and later, de facto, segregation status. Entering the \u201cold money\u201d neighborhood of Old Cloverdale, for example, he pointed out, \u201cif you\u2019ll notice, you don\u2019t see any black folks living in there.\u201d I did notice.\n\nMr. Wright, though, is not bitter. He has built for himself a quiet life of hunting and fishing, driving around for money and minding his own business. \u201cEven through the segregation and hatred,\u201d he said, \u201cMontgomery, I wouldn\u2019t trade it.

Does it bother you, that designation?\n\nWe were making fun of my persona. I\u2019m not a household name like Brad Pitt. People like to have labels for actors, and the truth is, every actor is a character actor. When I say actor, I mean actresses as well. Toni Collette is a good example of someone who can do both leading lady and transformational characters, where you\u2019re barely recognizing them. I think Billy Crudup, Chris Walken, Robert De Niro, they\u2019re all great examples of that.\n\nPeople often use the word \u201cquirky\u201d to describe your characters. Do they all have to be iterations of you?\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Watching Get the most out of your screen time with movie and TV recommendations, news and commentary from New York Times experts.

I can relate to self-loathing. The reason a person lashes out the way Dixon does is because he hates himself, so anybody can relate to that. I\u2019m drawn to complex characters; they\u2019re all filled with so many different feelings, and that\u2019s what makes them interesting. The first \u201cIron Man,\u201d Tony Stark, was an interesting character. He drinks too much, he\u2019s a womanizer, and then he has this epiphany. That\u2019s what\u2019s interesting.\n\nWhat do you think it was about this role, and this film, that led to so many awards?\n\nIt\u2019s the transformational aspect of it, the fact that he was really many different roles wrapped up in one role. He\u2019s a doofus, he\u2019s a racist, he\u2019s violent, he\u2019s a mama\u2019s boy. There\u2019s a few heroic things at certain points. But he\u2019s very flawed, and it\u2019s a boy-to-man journey.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThere\u2019s been criticism that your character got away scot-free for his racist behavior and for throwing a guy out the window, and never being brought to justice.\n\nIt\u2019s a small town and, who knows, in real life maybe he would have gotten thrown in prison. It\u2019s a sort of dark fairy tale in certain ways \u2014 it\u2019s not necessarily meant to be completely realistic. And if it is meant to be realistic, in real life, things aren\u2019t tied up in a bow. People who deserve to get punished don\u2019t necessarily get punished.\n\nDid it surprise you that there was criticism of the movie along these lines?\n\nNo, whenever a movie is popular and it is a complex dramatic story, I think it\u2019s going to stir up a lot of feelings. A lot of good stuff come out of it \u2014 the billboards that have been popping up [activists recreated versions of the billboards in Miami and London]. That\u2019s kind of incredible, when a movie can effect social change, that\u2019s kind of astounding. I think Mildred [the film\u2019s mother, played by Frances McDormand, who is seeking justice in the murder of her daughter] is a really beautiful working-class wonder woman in some ways. It\u2019s a kind of antihero slash protagonist thing that I think women really need right now. Mildred and [the directors] Greta Gerwig and Patty Jenkins. It\u2019s been an incredibly vibrant year.\n\nYou\u2019re a really good dancer \u2014 you can really bust a move. You did the splits on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d How did that come about? Is it self-taught?\n\nIt\u2019s a long story, but I hung out with a certain crowd, and it was a way to meet girls.\n\nWhat kind of certain crowd?\n\nSan Francisco is not all cable cars and Rice-A-Roni. There were some tough kids there. When I was in middle school, there was a more white supremacist kind of group I didn\u2019t get along with. I got in a lot of fights with them and didn\u2019t win a lot of those fights. I didn\u2019t get along with the rich kids, people we called WPODs: white punks on dope. My school was interracial, and I met a cool group of friends who introduced me to some other friends. I used to do really bad break dancing, when \u201cThriller\u201d and \u201cPurple Rain\u201d came out. I was into Run-DMC, Grandmaster Flash, Doug E. Fresh, Eric B. & Rakim. Probably my biggest inspiration was James Brown, and watching Tom Cruise in \u201cRisky Business.\u201d I remember practicing that, and watching James Brown do the splits. I [recently] did SoulCycle, I\u2019m not proud to say, and Usher was next to me. I thought I had rhythm until I was on a bicycle next to Usher. This is what happens when you go to spinning class in Hollywood.\n\nWere you intimidated working with Frances McDormand?\n\nI think it\u2019s the biggest compliment to Frances that people are asking, \u201cWere you intimidated by her?\u201d Not really, but I was nervous to get in the ring with a great actor. I\u2019ve worked with a lot of great actors. She\u2019s really a force. I think what\u2019s great about her is her integrity. Her sense of truth is like an iron bar. All these people \u2014 Woody [Harrelson, a co-star], Martin [McDonagh, the film\u2019s writer-director], Frances \u2014 are true anarchists, they really are. I think it comes through in their work. I\u2019m not exactly conventional either.\n\nSo your dad posted a comment on that New York Times essay criticizing the film \u2014 he defended you. Was it definitely your dad?\n\nYes that was my father. I didn\u2019t read the article, but they read that quote to me on the Jimmy Kimmel show. That was my dad being a supportive father. He was just looking out for the kid.", "keywords": ["york", "lot", "secret", "kind", "thats", "hes", "break", "bad", "dancer", "really", "actor", "sam", "rockwell", "character", "think", "movie", "past"], "polarity": 0.20883392294682618, "subjectivity": 0.5147564353209513},

While it may not be a common vantage point, the narrative is a natural one for Marilyn Stern, a photographer and graphic artist who is a member of the Metropolitan Postcard Club of New York City.\n\nNot surprisingly, the vast majority of postcards that feature black people in the United States from the 19th and 20th centuries were very racist, she said.\n\n\u201cI was so sick of seeing these horrible racist stereotypes,\u201d said Ms. Stern, a collector since the mid-1970s. \u201cWhenever I came across something that was not racist or not stereotypical, or even went so far as showing romance between the races, I wanted to save it and collect it.\u201d\n\nHer collection, which numbers about 3,000, has about 300 postcards that depict African-American life in all lights.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard for us to fathom how isolated people were, especially in rural areas and isolated small towns before there were telephones and radios,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were postal deliveries three times a day, so it was the internet of the early 1900s.\u201d\n\nPostcards had better printing technology than magazines and newspapers did at the time, as the burst of color in the selection below shows. They could show racism with clarity. \u201cThe idea that you could see images so realistic blew people away,\u201d she said.\n\nMany of the racist postcards were a form of propaganda, she said.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important to see how racism was manifested in the past,\u201d she said, \u201cperhaps to better fight it in the present. You can recognize something if you\u2019ve seen it before.\u201d\n\nBelow is a selection from Ms. Stern\u2019s collection with descriptions based on her research.\n\nTrade Cards\n\nImage\n\nAfrican-Americans were often subjects \u2014 and targets \u2014 of advertising cards that were issued before 1900. These cards were frequently given away in products, or with the purchase of a product.\n\nAbove, an advertisement for J & P Coats thread. Below, a country doctor dispensing Ayer\u2019s Cathartic Pills.\n\nImage\n\nThe Cakewalk\n\nImage\n\nThe Cakewalk, a dance created by plantation slaves as a satire of Southern white society, was the focus of these cards, which featured two black children and an African-American troupe that toured Europe in the late 1800s and early 1900s.\n\nRacist Cards\n\nImage\n\nThe card on the left was shot in a professional studio, but it was labeled \u201cHer Country Cousins.\u201d The implication was that no matter how refined, educated or successful black Americans became, they were still basically savages, Ms. Stern said.\n\nThe two cards on the right were produced in 1905 in New York on the common theme of the delivery stork. The first one, with the caption \u201cComparing Notes,\u201d shows both a black baby and a white baby, with no apparent bias. The second one shows two black babies with the slogan \u201cNo Race Suicide,\u201d implying that a high black birthrate threatened white supremacy, she said.\n\n\u201cLovers of All Nations\u201d\n\nImage\n\nThis postcard was from a series mailed in 1908 that was called \u201cLovers of All Nations.\u201d The banjo was a racial stereotype, but the card is in the non-discriminating \u201cFamily of Man\u201d tradition.\n\nMemories of Slavery\n\nImage\n\nPostcards once served as documentary photography. Some cards honored older African-Americans of the South, who were living memories of slavery. This was part of a series, and it was mailed in 1906.\n\nLife in the Jim Crow South\n\nImage\n\nA fortuneteller with white clients, mailed in 1908.\n\nHoliday Greetings\n\nImage\n\nIdealized country life, in a card mailed in 1907, as Americans flocked to cities.\n\nReligion\n\nImage\n\nA card, likely from the early 1950s, urging parishioners to come to church.\n\nReal Photos\n\nImage\n\nAn unidentified young woman in her graduation cap and gown, in a studio portrait taken between the 1920s and \u201940s. Cards labeled \u201cReal Photo Postcards\u201d are set apart from commercially printed postcards and are actual photographs printed on photographic paper with a preprinted postcard back.\n\nAchievement\n\nImage\n\nThe many important contributions that African-Americans made to society were rarely acknowledged in older postcards, but an exception was made for the scientist and educator George Washington Carver.\n\nHis experiments with peanuts, sweet potatoes and other crops contributed greatly to the economy of the South. This card \u2014 from a photo shot on Kodachrome or Ektachrome film \u2014 is from the late 1950s to mid-60s.\n\nFor more, see Ms. Stern\u2019s postcard blog, and a review of the film Through a Lens Darkly that deals with African-American representation in postcards and photography.

But those seeking to dismiss their stories of pain and demands for equality argued that the payments were proof that their accounts could not be trusted.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cYou get this idea immediately after the war, during these testimonies, that people talking about civil rights are literally getting paid\u201d to tell fabricated stories, Ms. Richardson said.\n\nThat belief spread to other contexts, too. Testimony from African-Americans on the violence perpetrated by the Ku Klux Klan, for example, was explained away as funded falsehoods.\n\n\u201cThey were attracted by a fee of two dollars per diem, and in many cases were evidently drilled for the occasion,\u201d one politician said of the testimony, according to an 1871 news report. The accounts, he said, were \u201cof the lowest kind and utterly unworthy of belief.\u201d\n\nTo Ms. Richardson, those early dismissals of African-American testimony, starting with the congressional hearings during the Reconstruction era, are not unlike the false theories spread about the Parkland school shooting suggesting that the student survivors were actors paid to protest for gun control.\n\n\u201cThat actually sounds very much like what you got in those first congressional hearings,\u201d she said.", "keywords": ["york", "violence", "nonviolent", "sign", "goes", "isnt", "smear", "testimony", "era", "civil", "idea", "war", "crisis", "africanamericans", "actor", "richardson", "spread"], "polarity": 0.07269919269919271, "subjectivity": 0.43285187785187784},

The scene never made it into the movie. So, what happened? In a conversation with ScreenCrush\u2019s E. Oliver Whitney, the screenwriter Joe Robert Cole, one of the writers for \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d says he vaguely recalls some discussion of whether to include the lesbian love story. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t some major theme through that we were looking to explore with [those characters] in terms of the story,\u201d Cole clarifies. \u201cWe didn\u2019t like, pull out a full thread of some theme.\u201d\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t Play With Our Emotions: \u201cBlack Panther\u201d and Queer Representation\u2019 [The Root]\n\nBriana Lawrence, who identifies as a queer black woman, was surprised that the scene\u2019s exclusion didn\u2019t bother her. \u201cI should\u2019ve been cursing Ryan Coogler out, swift and fast like my mama taught me when someone pisses me off,\u201d she writes. \u201cBut after thinking it over, I\u2019m happy the scene didn\u2019t make it into the movie, and that feels blasphemous to admit as someone who is always championing representation \u2014 especially for queer folks of color like me.\u201d\n\nHeartwarming Bonus Read: \u2018I Took 7th Graders to See \u201cBlack Panther.\u201d Here\u2019s What They Said.\u2019 [The New York Times]\n\nProf. Kevin Noble Maillard watched the film with a handful of tweens from a Brooklyn public school.

A graduate of Nascar\u2019s Drive for Diversity program, Darrell Wallace Jr., 24, could give stock car racing something it has never had before: an African-American star.\n\nBut that is not why Richard Petty brought Wallace onto his team. Late last season, Wallace, who goes by the nickname Bubba, got four rides with Richard Petty Motorsports. It was enough for Petty, one of Nascar\u2019s most iconic names, to not only give Wallace a full-time ride, but also to give him his famed No. 43 racecar to drive. Wallace is the first African-American to drive full-time in the top Nascar series since Wendell Scott in 1971.\n\nPetty insisted, though, that he is colorblind when it comes to evaluating talent. Sure, it would be great if Wallace brings the sport into the African-American community, but as far as Petty is concerned, that\u2019s secondary.\n\n\u201cI hope he advances us as a race team,\u201d Petty said in an email. \u201cI care about what Bubba can do behind the wheel for us. The rest, there are a lot of eyes on Bubba, but he\u2019s handling it well. I know come Sunday he\u2019ll be ready to get into a racecar and just show his talent. If he does well, the rest will come and he\u2019ll grow our fan base.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThose eyes on Wallace, much as they were on Tiger Woods a generation ago, prompted Earnhardt to call him last week.

He\u2019s an amazing ambassador for the sport. And he\u2019s really talented and a heck of a competitor. All of us are competitive, but his competitiveness is unlike anyone I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\nNascar\u2019s diversity has become an issue again after its only female racer, Danica Patrick, announced she will retire from the circuit after the Daytona 500. But Wallace is not the only driver who can energize an overlooked community. What he can do for an African-American audience, Su\u00e1rez can do for the Latino market. A native of Monterrey, Mexico, Su\u00e1rez said he had noticed an uptick in social media messages from a variety of Latino countries.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s usually either people who tell me they\u2019re now following the sport because of me, or they\u2019ve been fans and now they have a driver to root for,\u201d said Su\u00e1rez, who is also a graduate of the Drive for Diversity program. \u201cThe potential is huge. This is the most diverse country in the world, but we have to improve diversity in Nascar. If we can make the sport more diverse, we\u2019ll see the same thing with fans.

After graduating from Lanier High School, he went to Morehouse College, the historically black institution in Atlanta, and was working on the student newspaper when it published some of the early writings of another Morehouse student, Martin Luther King Jr. Mr. Bennett graduated in 1949, the year after King did, and went to work at the black newspaper Atlanta Daily World.\n\nHe moved to Jet magazine in Chicago in 1953 as an associate editor and to Ebony, its sister publication, a year later. He became senior editor there in 1958 and later executive editor. He worked for the magazine into his 80s.\n\n\u201cBefore the Mayflower\u201d established Mr. Bennett as a leading scholarly voice during the racial ferment of the 1960s.

Townships have gotten electricity and more modern housing. Government contracts have been set aside for black would-be entrepreneurs.\n\nThese programs have had an impact, improving material conditions and generating jobs.\n\nThey have also been riddled with corruption.\n\nPhoto\n\nAt local governments across South Africa, bureaucrats have abused their authority to steer contracts to companies that put cash in their pockets. At every level of society, people have grown accustomed to kickbacks and political connections determining who prospers, and who goes without.\n\nMr. Zuma\u2019s demise resonates as a sign of a potential new order taking shape. He will forever be linked to his association with the Guptas, three Indian-born brothers who effectively bought key levers of governmental power, amassing influence so comprehensive that it became known as \u201cstate capture.\u201d\n\nHis resignation has raised hopes that South Africa is finally contending with its epidemic of corruption. That view gained momentum when an elite police unit raided a home belonging to the Guptas nearly at the same moment that Mr. Ramaphosa was assuming office.\n\nThe new president is a hero of the anti-apartheid struggle, a former deputy president and chairman of the National Planning Commission, a focal point for thinking about how to engineer economic growth. As a former trade union leader and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Mr. Mandela, he enjoys credibility among a range of interest groups, while carrying a reputation as a savvy and strategic operator.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe has had his brushes with controversy, most notably after a 2012 police massacre of striking platinum miners that killed 34 people. At the time, Mr. Ramaphosa occupied a seat on the board of Lonmin, the company that owned the mine. Emails soon surfaced showing that, a day before the police opened fire, Mr. Ramaphosa had been urging senior government officials to take strong action to end the strike.\n\nPhoto\n\nStill, no corruption charges have stuck to the new president, who now claims a mandate to clean up the toxic mess left behind by Mr. Zuma.\n\nSome doubt whether the A.N.C. can be salvaged as an effective vehicle for egalitarian policymaking. The party\u2019s executive ranks include many figures implicated in corruption. Mr. Ramaphosa, 65, may champion new initiatives aimed at generating economic growth, yet he finds himself relying on his party brethren to execute his visions, with no certainty that the money will land where intended.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t necessarily think that taking the president out does much to dismantle the patronage network,\u201d said Ayabonga Cawe, a development economist at Xesibe Holdings, a research and advisory firm in Johannesburg. \u201cYou\u2019re going to need a lot more than taking out the guy at the top.\u201d\n\nAbove all, Mr. Ramaphosa must contend with the structural defects that have long constrained South Africa\u2019s economy, a legacy of apartheid.\n\nBeyond its systemic discrimination against black people, apartheid severed the country from much of the global economy. It ensured that huge numbers of uneducated black South Africans were available at poverty-level wages within major sectors of the economy like mining, agriculture and textiles. That cushioned domestic companies from the pressure to modernize.\n\nPhoto\n\nInternational sanctions isolated South Africa, shielding its firms from competition against multinational rivals. Sanctions also denied South African companies the ability to operate abroad, giving them an incentive to focus on the domestic market. The apartheid-era government obliged with subsidies for favored firms while allowing companies to pursue oligopoly, free of nuisances like antitrust law.\n\nThe result was a system in which large industries, from retail to furniture-making to chemicals, were dominated by huge enterprises whose core strength was the ability to protect themselves against competition. That system has largely prevailed, with smaller companies and start-ups facing often-impossible odds.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cApartheid was a system that lends itself to large conglomerates and concentrations of wealth in the hands of a few,\u201d Mr. Cawe said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about the corruption. It\u2019s about all of these parallel networks in big business that you need to dismantle. Most of those are white.\u201d\n\nHere is a world that Mr. Ramaphosa knows keenly, having achieved extraordinary affluence by running South African companies with interests in mining, banking, real estate and telecommunications. His fortune has been estimated at $450 million.\n\nIf he is serious about reinvigorating the economy and creating a space for black-owned small businesses, he will need to take on the prevailing structure that made him so wealthy.\n\nHis success on that front may be even more decisive than whether he can tame corruption.\n\n\u201cThis is certainly the most optimistic moment for South Africa in a very long time,\u201d said Mr. Goldin, the former adviser to Mr. Mandela. \u201cIn a way, it does feel like a new beginning.

The aggressive pace of deportations of immigrants of color, the elimination of the DACA program protecting immigrant children and the proposals propounded by the anti-immigration voices in the administration will all have the undeniable effect of slowing the rapid racial diversification of the United States population. Despite this sweeping attempt at racial social engineering, few voices in progressive and Democratic circles are responding with the kinds of outrage that one would expect.\n\nThe pro-white preferences of Donald Trump and his administration, especially when it comes to immigration, are legion. From the day he opened his presidential campaign in 2015 by demonizing Mexicans to the enthusiasm generated by the calls for building a wall along the Mexican border to aggressively ramping up deportations of immigrants of color to eliminating DACA to vulgarly denigrating African nations and Haiti, this administration has been quite clear about its preference for white people.\n\nIt should be no surprise, then, that the immigration policies championed by the White House would all have the effect of reducing the number of people of color coming into the country. A recent study by The Washington Post found that the administration\u2019s proposals to curtail legal immigration by limiting family reunification would slightly delay the date when whites become a minority. \u201cBy greatly slashing the number of Hispanic and black African immigrants entering America, this proposal would reshape the future United States,\u201d the economist Michael Clemens said.\n\n\u201cDecades ahead,\u201d he added, \u201cmany fewer of us would be nonwhite or have nonwhite people in our families.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe administration\u2019s focus is not random.

Since the passage of the 1965 Immigration and Naturalization Act, the chromatic composition of the country\u2019s population has undergone a fundamental transformation. People of color used to make up 12 percent of the United States population in 1965, and that percentage has more than tripled over the past several decades to the point where nonwhite people are nearly 39 percent of the residents of the United States (it is no accident that the country\u2019s first African-American president was elected when he was elected). Mr. Trump\u2019s team understands that the specific laws it seeks to eliminate have played a significant role in that demographic revolution.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

The very first immigration law passed, the Naturalization Act of 1790, declared that to become a citizen, one had to be a \u201cfree white person.\u201d That demarcation was the explicit law of the land for the next 162 years, until 1952. There are 20th-century Supreme Court cases explicitly holding that Asian immigrants could not become United States citizens because they were not white. Even after 1952, the practical effect of immigration policy continued to promote white people above others through mechanisms such as the Asia Pacific Triangle, which restricted immigration from Asian countries.", "keywords": ["white", "sign", "states", "color", "effect", "america", "immigrants", "immigration", "wants", "nonwhite", "united", "trump", "population"], "polarity": 0.07678771845438513, "subjectivity": 0.2882194965528299},

Almost all of those who led the campaign to bring him to account were black, like Thuli Madonsela, the former public protector, who played a heroic role in exposing Mr. Zuma\u2019s corruption. South Africa\u2019s judiciary, which is majority black, defended the independence of the courts with extraordinary courage and under great pressure. After this display of black courage, why would it matter what white people think?\n\nBut South Africa is too fraught and complex a place for such a simple story to ring true. More plausible is that each pinprick penetrating Mr. Zuma\u2019s skin is felt by black South Africans, even those who are horrified by what he has done.\n\nBeneath the surface of public life, one can detect a strange, subliminal to-and-fro. Last year, for instance, a superb book describing in meticulous detail the deep corruption of the late apartheid years, \u201cApartheid Guns and Money,\u201d by Hennie van Vuuren, was a runaway best seller. It deserved to be widely read, but the scale of its success is partly a function of its utility as a weapon against white arrogance. \u201cHowever bad Zuma is,\u201d its many black readers could say to themselves, \u201cyou people were worse.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

For the truth is that Mr. Zuma and his allies were corrupt partly because they felt a sense of grievance intimately connected to their experience of race.\n\nWhen Mr. Zuma became president of South Africa in 2009, he rallied behind him an alliance of people who felt themselves to be marginal and neglected, not just in relation to the world economic order or white South Africa but also in relation to the A.N.C. itself. The A.N.C. has been run by people drawn from the ranks of an urbane, cosmopolitan elite.\n\nMr. Zuma represented a dramatic change in this tradition. Although he spent years in exile and climbed the ranks of the A.N.C., his biography was unlike any of his predecessors\u2019. Nelson Mandela was born into royalty. Thabo Mbeki was the son of prominent intellectuals. Mr. Zuma\u2019s mother worked in the kitchen of a white family and was too poor to provide her son with a formal education. He grew up herding cattle in the hinterland.\n\nWhen he came to power in 2009, he did so with the support of organizations representing much of the urban working class \u2014 the country\u2019s largest trade union and the South African Communist Party.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut he soon dropped these organizations and turned for support to rural South Africa, in particular to traditional leaders and to the elites of far-flung provincial capitals. They carried with them into power an abiding sense of powerlessness, a feeling that the very institutions they now controlled were alien and belonged to others. In office, they believed that they had entered into their enemy\u2019s mansion. It seemed to be payback time.\n\nIn a speech delivered to a room of black businesspeople in December 2016, Mr. Zuma warned of the sophisticated ways in which the enemy confuses black people. One source of such confusion was the prevailing economic orthodoxy. Mr. Zuma suggested that the most fundamental of economic laws was merely nominal; remove the scales from our eyes and we see that so-called economic laws are a ruse invented by the powerful.\n\nHis genre of criminality is light-years from the sort that characterized the apartheid state. The corruption of apartheid\u2019s leaders stemmed from arrogance; they believed that they could control the world forever. Mr. Zuma\u2019s corruption stems from the grievances of a man who feels very small.\n\nThis sense of grievance was on display in the last words he uttered publicly as president. In a swipe at his successor, Mr. Ramaphosa, Mr. Zuma suggested that those in the party who had unseated him were \u201cserving the interests of the oppressors of yesteryear, who joyfully celebrate as we lynch one another.\u201d\n\nBlack nationalism in South Africa has many faces. Mr. Ramaphosa represents a strand that is bourgeois, worldly and comfortable with power. There is also a militant, socialist strand of black nationalism, but it is on the wane. And there is the strand represented by Mr. Zuma, who governed as a man shaped and distorted by the violence and oppression of white supremacy.\n\nI am of course alive to the irony of a white South African like me saying that a black president\u2019s corruption was motivated by racial grievance. Many South Africans, black and white, would regard this argument as an excuse for the intolerable. But we should be honest enough to accept that even now, notwithstanding that apartheid has been gone since before nearly half the South African population was born, the legacy of white supremacy has lived on in the man who was president.", "keywords": ["white", "distinctive", "south", "economic", "zuma", "mr", "whats", "corruption", "zumas", "mess", "jacob", "africa", "apartheid", "black"], "polarity": 0.0616115067727971, "subjectivity": 0.37158776707163793},

Evenly lit, crisply photographed, they look like pictures from an illustrated medical dictionary, indexical images of heads, torsos and mouths that are detached from context. Even in a work like \u201cFigure\u201d (1991), the figure in question, sheathed in a black dress and set in the black infinity of no particular place, feels like a fragment, as though she had been extracted from a group photo or a furnished room. The texts accompanying her, eight engraved plastic plaques, read like excerpts from a language primer: \u201cfigured the worst,\u201d \u201che was disfigured,\u201d \u201cfigured there would be no reaction\u201d and so on. Here, not only has the story been winnowed down; it is in fact completely gone. There\u2019s no story. We are left with only the tensions of concrete poetry.\n\nSometime in the mid-1990s, Simpson began to detect clich\u00e9d responses to her work. At the same time, her own thinking was evolving. What does an image of a black woman mean? A commentary on race? An assertion about gender? Simpson branched out from figure-based images and began to experiment more with varied subject matter \u2014 landscapes and inanimate objects like wigs \u2014 and also with unusual quasi-sculptural material like felt and standing screens. A series of monumental multisectional images, several of them landscapes, collectively titled \u201cPublic Sex\u201d (1995-1998) and featuring no figures at all, addressed the provocative title only obliquely. These pictures, made over many years, contain what the scholar and curator Okwui Enwezor calls \u201cthe rumor of the body.\u201d Mysteries of a jagged and deadpan sort, they would go on to influence the noirish tone of Simpson\u2019s later film work.\n\nPhoto\n\nSimpson began to set ever more intricate conceptual layers between her initial inspiration for a work and the finished product. The idea for \u201c9 Props\u201d (1995) began during a residency at the Pilchuck Glass School in Washington. With the aid of artisans at the school, she fabricated a series of dark vessels modeled on vases and other objects used in the portrait work of the pioneering Harlem photographer James Van Der Zee. But these vessels were not the final work. She shipped them back to New York and then photographed them against a plain background. And that still was not the work. Further intervention followed: She turned those photographic images into nine lithographs, which she printed on felt. Finally, she wrote captions below each lithographed vessel, describing the context in which it originally appeared. One of them, for instance, reads:\n\nDinner Party with boxer Harry Wills, 1926 James VanDerZee Harry Wills a k a \u201cThe Black Panther,\u201d boxer, businessman- sits with seven other men and women, mostly women with champagne glasses raised as a woman on his left makes a toast in his honor. There are three bottles of champagne, a crystal decanter, a bottle of port, an arrangement of flowers and fruit, and before each guest an untouched china place setting.\n\nPhoto\n\nFrom multiple directions, the work gestures at what cannot be seen: the original placement of the vessels that inspired Simpson\u2019s own, the people in the photographs by James Van Der Zee, the social life of Harlem evoked by his photographs and the complexity of manners and class implied by them. All that vanished world of culture and experience is reduced to an elegant grid, as simple as an antiquarian\u2019s catalog, a thought picture that demands calm engagement and imaginative intervention on the viewer\u2019s part. Without being representational, it is about race; but race is not off in some category by itself, hemmed in only by questions of skin color, separate from life.\n\n\u201cRepresent!\u201d in the black American sense means standing up for your people, expressing solidarity and letting a shared ethos underwrite your presence and work. It is an exhortation, a greeting and a farewell. The word also has more conventional associations. In the visual arts, it is contrasted with the abstract or the symbolic. To represent, in this more common sense, is to make work that visually corresponds to realities out there in the world: to illustrate uncomplicatedly. This second sense of \u201crepresent\u201d is enjoying a vogue in the art world. Realism is back. This is welcome: after so long an absence of black figures and black faces in art museums, they are now being seen more frequently. Many artists, black and otherwise, are depicting the black body. It is necessary and often successful. Just as often, it fails when it is little more than a clumsy shorthand for socially concerned art, unobjectionable and unimpressive.\n\nA strong appeal of Simpson\u2019s work is that she has always embraced the inherent complexity of blackness, her own blackness as well as the blackness that runs ineluctably through American history. She does not reject representational depictions, but neither does she feel the need to confine herself only to \u201crace\u201d work. When an artist uses a black model, she is presenting a human question by foregrounding a human presence. Is a white man a person while a black woman is and can only be a gendered and racialized subject? As the scholar Kellie Jones has pointed out, nonwhite bodies are often thought of as \u201cnot neutral enough for the dispassionate formulas thought to constitute conceptual practice.\u201d If a black woman\u2019s race and gender are the only things apparent to certain viewers, Simpson seems to say, the ethical responsibility to escape those shackles is the viewer\u2019s.\n\nFreedom is Lorna Simpson\u2019s starting point and her permanent theme. A humane current animates all of her work, a current that neither sidesteps nor confines itself to race. Her work is simultaneously about the \u201cneutral\u201d space of ideas and the particularized experience of the body. \u201cMontage\u201d is photographic and painterly, a riff on a pair of found photographs, sequenced to look like a giant strip of film. It deals with dreams and nightmares, ambiguities and vulnerabilities. At its heart is what Simpson calls \u201cthe push and pull of photography\u201d: the stuttering potential inherent in mechanical reproduction and the imperfect registrations that mirror subconscious life. It is a rapid response to the current political climate, situating a crucial part of it in the most intimate space of all, where the hectoring \u201cthey\u201d is temporarily held at bay in favor of the puzzled \u201cI.\u201d In your own sleeping bed, images persist and words are hard to come by.

To some extent, there\u2019s always been an adversarial role between the White House and reporters. How do you feel about the tenor of things now? It used to be friendly-adversarial. There would be retaliation for stories they didn\u2019t like, but nothing compared with this. There\u2019s a war going on. For a president to come out with the term \u201cfake news\u201d \u2014 he\u2019s putting targets on our heads. He has moved the goal posts when it comes to how politicians and people deal with the press.\n\nWhat\u2019s the value of the White House press briefing? Transparency. There is a veil on the White House; people want to look behind the curtain. It\u2019s their house. When you open up a press briefing to see the back and forth, you\u2019re getting more in the weeds of what\u2019s going on, beyond just the quote we may put in the story. This is a key piece that I don\u2019t think people really get: When you talk about the press, it\u2019s not about journalists; it\u2019s about the free-flowing information that the American public is supposed to get. When you bash the press, you\u2019re bashing the idea of getting truth out.\n\nWhat\u2019s the public opinion of the White House press corps? It depends on whom you talk to. We\u2019re so tribal now. There used to be a day when you didn\u2019t know the person\u2019s politics. The line has been obscured between facts and opinion. I think it started during the Clinton years, and it just kept getting progressively worse. People don\u2019t want to just hear the news; they want to hear what people have to say about it too.\n\nYour reactions during the televised briefings have generated memes. Has it made you more self-conscious? I\u2019m so sad about that. My boss has always said, \u201cYou need to know how to play poker.\u201d I don\u2019t. I\u2019m trying! The last time I was really caught off guard was when Sarah Huckabee Sanders said something about people\u2019s minds being in the gutter after President Trump\u2019s tweet about Kirsten Gillibrand. I really get into those briefings. I really try to listen. I don\u2019t play to the camera. I go in there, and I\u2019m really earnest. So when she said that, I was shocked! I was like, No, God, that was a little bit much.\n\nGiven how much you tangle with this particular administration, why do you think you get called on so much? Have you felt like a target? Yes, I have. But I have to shake that off, because I have to go in and do my job. I cover the White House. I cover all issues, particularly those that affect black and brown Americans. Now, what if they didn\u2019t call on me? A certain segment of America would not get the answers to some of their pressing questions. If I don\u2019t ask, who will?\n\nRyan is the White House correspondent and Washington bureau chief for American Urban Radio Networks and a political analyst for CNN.

You had to ask whether this president believed slavery was wrong. I recently asked him, \u201cAre you a racist?\u201d It\u2019s a sad day when you have to ask a sitting president that. There has been a series of comments or lack of action, from calling Elizabeth Warren \u201cPocahontas\u201d to how he dealt with Charlottesville to his comments on Norway versus Haiti, Africa, El Salvador, black and brown nations. It\u2019s not been one thing. It\u2019s been a pattern. So I asked. He did not answer, which I thought was a wasted moment. He could have put it to rest right then and there and said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not a racist.\u201d But it took him days to say that.\n\nYou said it seems as if it has changed, going forward, how the White House deals with the press corps and wields its power. What do you think this means for the next president you cover? He\u2019ll clamp down harder on us. Each president has pushed us further away from access.

The goal is to support 500 interns a year by 2020 \u2014 which, incidentally, might be when Mr. Garcetti follows through on his consideration to run for president.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

In 2017, a Milken Institute study showed people of color in Hollywood were underrepresented compared to the racial demographics of Los Angeles as a whole, and underpaid compared to their white counterparts. It reported similar findings for women.\n\n\u201cWhen \u2018Oscars So White\u2019 and \u2018Time\u2019s Up\u2019 put a spotlight on inequality in Hollywood, they captured the frustrations of people shut out of opportunity in what the world knows as L.A.\u2019s signature industry,\u201d Mr. Garcetti said in a news release.\n\nAdded Ms. DuVernay in the statement: \u201cReal change happens when we take tangible action \u2014 and that means giving young women and people of color opportunities in the industry early on.\u201d", "keywords": ["york", "sign", "start", "times", "young", "helps", "color", "los", "hollywood", "women", "ava", "duvernay", "garcetti", "angeles", "diversity", "initiative"], "polarity": 0.10301062573789847, "subjectivity": 0.34666961826052733},

Just like our kid who\u2019s not white dresses up like Captain America. I think the beautiful thing about comics is they do transcend race in a lot of ways.\u201d\n\nMary Dimacali, 29, a social media and marketing manager in Rockland County, New York, echoed that idea. She does not believe that her fianc\u00e9\u2019s 7-year-old son, Sawyer, who is white, sees the film or its characters through the lens of race. Sawyer himself, during the interview with Ms. Dimacali, said, \u201csure,\u201d when she asked if he\u2019d like to dress up as Black Panther.\n\n\u201cFor a white kid to be so open and judge based on the character\u2019s story and the personality and history, I think that\u2019s what\u2019s important,\u201d she said. \u201cBut on the flip side, I think it\u2019s also great to have a black superhero you can identify and connect to.\u201d\n\nThe character\u2019s history is unique. Created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in 1966, Black Panther rules as the king of an African technological utopia known as Wakanda. Untouched by European invaders, Wakanda exists apart from the legacies of colonization and racism. Black history and black fantasy are central to the character, and the series has brought on prominent black writers including Ta-Nehisi Coates to deepen its significance over the last 50 years.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Of the Moment The lifestyle newsletter from the Styles, Travel and Food sections, offering the latest trends to news you can use.

He is completing \u201cRise of the Black Panther,\u201d a six-part comic series for Marvel that traces the character\u2019s early history. He has tried to explain some of that history to his 7-year-old daughter, but without delving too deeply into complex concepts like Western imperialism, which she may struggle to grasp.\n\n\u201cYou want that white kid to be able to think that he can dress up in a Black Panther costume, because, to that kid, there\u2019s no difference between Captain America and Black Panther,\u201d Mr. Narcisse, 45, said. But, he added, it also involves \u201ctrying to explain what is special about T\u2019Challa and Wakanda without racism. And it\u2019s like, \u2018Can\u2019t do it.\u2019 I couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAccording to the ticketing site Fandango, \u201cBlack Panther\u201d set a record among Marvel films for the most advance tickets sold in a 24-hour period. It\u2019s projected to make a record-breaking $165 million over Presidents\u2019 Day weekend and comparisons to last year\u2019s \u201cWonder Woman\u201d bode well for its reception and impact, particularly for black people.\n\n\u201cWhite people have the privilege of not constantly being reminded of their race in the United States, where white is the majority, whereas as a black person you don\u2019t,\u201d Ms. Vittrup said. She believes that parents in general, and white parents in particular, are reluctant to talk about race with young children. When they do, they often miss the chance to talk about inequality, even though research supports the idea that children develop an awareness of race and difference at a very young age.\n\nMs. Vittrup was careful to add that dressing as Black Panther isn\u2019t inherently appropriative or offensive. The character comes from an invented African country, and to wear his mask isn\u2019t quite the same as wearing blackface. However, in a moment where even more black heroes, like Luke Cage and Black Lightning, are finding their way into the limelight, Black Panther\u2019s relationship with the black community and its history creates an opportunity to teach nonblack children about the black experience.\n\n\u201cKids are not colorblind,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of structural inequality in our society, and kids are noticing that. By not mentioning it, by not talking about it, we\u2019re essentially preserving the status quo.\u201d", "keywords": ["white", "york", "race", "characters", "panthers", "mask", "dress", "think", "meanings", "panther", "black", "history", "kid"], "polarity": 0.05700972543438296, "subjectivity": 0.3779504437723616}
