But these voices could soon be drowned out by powerful sonic booms from vessels searching for oil and gas.\n\nPresident Trump is opening up the Atlantic Coast to companies to explore for fresh reserves. And to explore, they will be making some of the loudest sounds ever heard in the ocean \u2014 sounds that, according to recent research, could harm marine animals from whales to plankton.\n\nFive companies are currently applying for permits to use seismic air guns to survey thousands of miles of the seabed along the Atlantic Coast. If they get the permits, they could start later this year.\n\nThe air guns are devices towed behind a ship. They compress and then release air explosively, and the sound waves penetrate the seabed. When they bounce back to receivers, also towed from the ships, the sound waves paint a picture of reservoirs of oil and gas beneath the seabed.\n\nThe Sound Of Seismic Testing 0:16\n\nThe sound blasts can also damage the ears and internal organs of marine animals. Ships will have to turn them off if they see whales or other marine mammals nearby.\n\nBut there's growing evidence that these sounds may seriously affect animals swimming well outside the immediate danger zone. Aaron Thode is an oceanographer who's studied the subject and advises the Marine Mammal Commission, a federal agency that regulates activities affecting marine life.\n\n\n\n\"We don't know what happens if animals are exposed constantly to sound over long periods of time in, say, a feeding area or a breeding area or what not,\" Thode explains.\n\nThode works at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. He says whales have been observed retreating from the sound of air guns. That could cause them to abandon breeding or feeding grounds.\n\nThode's own research has shown that bowhead whales start calling more often to each other when there's air gun noise, at least for a while. \"At some point, you know, just as if a jet plane passes overhead, you just give up and wait for the sound to decrease,\" Thode says.\n\nIf the whales go silent, that not only has potential effects on their communication, but also on air gun surveyors. Federal rules require them to listen to for whale sounds and, if they hear them, to stop their air gun blasts. But if the whales aren't making noise, their presence underwater won't be known unless they're sighted at the surface.\n\n\n\nScientists believe that air gun sounds could \"mask\" communication by marine animals. Surveyors will be blasting several times a minute, for months at a time. Marine biologist Doug Nowacek at Duke University worries that that kind of constant noise could cause a mother, for example, to lose track of its calf. \"If they get separated by a few tens or hundreds of meters in an increasingly loud ocean,\" he says, \"you can consider it gone.\"\n\nNowacek says recent scientific evidence suggests that these more subtle effects of air guns could extend a long way. \"The levels that could still have and do have behavioral impacts extend out tens, and hundreds of miles away from those surveys,\" he says.\n\nAnd effects on smaller animals are emerging as well. Research in Australia shows that nearby air guns can actually kill shrimp-like plankton and their larvae. Even scallops have been observed recoiling from air gun sound.\n\nInterior Secretary Ryan Zinke rolled out the offshore energy plan at a press conference in January. He promised that the government will protect the environment. \"We do it right,\" he said, \"and we're not going to skirt protections, we're not going to give anyone a pass. We're going to hold corporations accountable.\"\n\n\n\nThe Interior Department completed an environmental impact study on seismic surveying in 2014 that runs several hundred pages. It says the effects on marine life will be moderate at worst. It points out that surveyors will stop their work if they see or hear whales within 500 yards and will keep away from places they're known to frequent. \"No significant impacts are expected to occur as a result of these seismic surveys,\" the Interior Department stated. The department estimates that there may by 90 billion barrels of undiscovered oil and over 300 trillion cubic feet of natural gas under the outer continental shelf along the Atlantic Coast.\n\n\n\nBut more than 70 scientists have written to Trump asking him to cancel the surveys anyway. They note that the surveys cover regions populated by several kinds of whales that are close to extinction. \"The magnitude of the proposed seismic activity is likely to have significant, long-lasting and widespread impacts on the reproduction and survival of fish and marine mammal populations in the region,\" the letter stated. Doug Nowacek is one of the scientists who signed the letter, and he adds that there's just not enough information to be sure the surveys are harmless. \"There are numerous species off the Atlantic Coast that we don't have any data whatsoever about their response to seismic,\" he says.\n\n\n\nScientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have been trying to take a census of what marine life lives along the continental shelf, where much of the surveying will take place. The region is heavily populated not only with several kinds of whales but dolphins and numerous other species, many of them commercially valuable. NOAA is still far from completing the task. Given that the surveys would cover tens of thousands of miles of ocean with potentially millions of sonic booms, there's no doubt that marine animals will be exposed.\n\n\n\nExploration companies maintain that there's no evidence that seismic testing has killed marine mammals. However, for several years, scientists have been working with exploration companies to develop newer air guns that are quieter. Some of these have been tested and found to work effectively at locating oil and gas reservoirs but they are not used commercially.\n\n\n\nThe Interior Department is expected to rule on the surveying permits in the next few weeks. Environmental and public interest groups are planning to legally challenge those permits if they are approved.", "keywords": ["sounds", "sound", "theres", "planned", "coast", "seismic", "whales", "pose", "air", "guns", "animals", "risk", "surveys", "life", "marine"], "polarity": 0.0753408388148648, "subjectivity": 0.42531952174809323},

The president will participate in a pair of listening sessions on school safety this week, and on Monday morning the White House said he supports efforts to improve the federal background check system, something Congress has expressed broad support for without acting on after past shootings.\n\nThe cyclical aftermath of the nation's mass shooting has repeated itself several times during Trump's year-old presidency, including with the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history when 52 people were killed on the Las Vegas strip last October, and when 26 people were killed at a church service in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in November.\n\nIn both instances, Democrats called for a major push for gun control, and even some Republicans said modest changes to the nation's gun laws might be in order.\n\nYet, no legislation was passed.\n\nThat cycle is slightly different this time. Students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., where the shooting took place, have joined the political debate.\n\n\"Politicians who sit in their gilded House and Senate seats funded by the NRA telling us nothing could have been done to prevent this, we call B.S.,\" student Emma Gonzalez said at a rally Saturday. \"They say tougher guns laws do not decrease gun violence. We call B.S.\"\n\nStudents and parents of those killed at Stoneman Douglas High School, even the conservative New York Post, have asked the president directly to take action on gun control. He didn't mention the word \"gun\" in an address to the nation the morning after the shooting and ignored questions from reporters about acting on guns when he visited the injured in Broward County, Fla., on Friday evening.\n\nThe president did take time on Sunday to criticize the FBI for failing to act on a lead about the alleged gunman, 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz, who police say has admitted to conducting the armed rampage with a legally purchased AR-15 rifle. Trump said the bureau has been spending too much time on the Russia probe, an apparently unrelated issue to the failure to pass the tip on Cruz to the FBI's Miami field office.\n\nSurvivors of the shooting and friends of victims reacted sadly and angrily to Trump's tweet.\n\n\"Oh my god,\" one wrote in a retweet of the president's tweet. \"17 OF MY CLASSMATES AND FRIENDS ARE GONE AND YOU HAVE THE AUDACITY TO MAKE THIS ABOUT RUSSIA???!! HAVE A DAMN HEART. You can keep all of your fake and meaningless 'thoughts and prayers'.\"\n\nIn addition to holding a rally and speaking out in news interviews and on social media since last week's shooting, students are organizing a nationwide walkout of students as a call to action on April 20, the 19th anniversary of the massacre at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.\n\nThe mother of a 14-year-old murdered at the Parkland school went on CNN and spoke directly to the camera, making an impassioned plea to Trump by name, asking him to \"do something\" to keep guns away from those who would carry out school shootings.\n\nWhat the president will ultimately do is unclear. Without expanding on what the goal is, the White House has scheduled a listening session for the president with high school students and teachers Wednesday.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump will meet \"with state and local officials on school safety.\" The next morning, the president will address the Conservative Political Action Conference, a group for which gun rights are a top issue. Wayne LaPierre, one of the leaders of the NRA, is also scheduled to speak.\n\nDemocrats have called for action on gun control once again, as they have after each mass shooting.\n\nAfter the Las Vegas massacre, some Republicans \u2014 and even the NRA \u2014 said the regulation of bump stocks was worth revisiting. Those are accessories that are used to allow semiautomatic weapons to fire as if they were automatic; they were used by the shooter in Las Vegas.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders was asked at the time about the president's role in possible action around bump stocks. \"We want to be part of that discussion, and we're certainly open to that moving forward,\" Sanders said, adding that Trump is a \"strong supporter of the Second Amendment.\"\n\nAfter the November shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas, it was discovered that records of the shooter's Air Force court-martial conviction for domestic violence were not properly entered into the national background-check system for gun purchases, and if they had, he would not have been able to legally obtain a gun. Changes to the background-check system were supported by the NRA, as well as Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, who introduced a bill with Democrat Chris Murphy of Connecticut, who became one of the most visible advocates for gun control after the 2012 shooting in Newtown, Conn.\n\nIn a statement Monday morning, the White House's Sanders said, \"The President spoke to Senator Cornyn on Friday about the bi-partisan bill he and Sen. Murphy introduced to improve Federal Compliance with Criminal Background check Legislation. While discussions are ongoing and revisions are being considered, the President is supportive of efforts to improve the Federal background check system.\"\n\nJust like the bump stock issue, though, Congress did not take up the background check legislation in the aftermath of the shooting in Texas.\n\nAsked about the lack of action on NBC's Meet the Press Sunday, Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., said there may be measures that could be put in place to make it harder to get a gun for someone with the behavioral warning signs people saw in Cruz. He also noted, though, the high bar to limiting gun ownership due to the Second Amendment.\n\n\"I have no issue with more extensive background checks,\" Lankford said. \"I have no issue with slowing down purchases for people that show all the basic warning signs. We have determined, as a country, that only a court can actually take away a constitutional right. And the right to keep and bear arms is a constitutional right.\"\n\nTrump signed a bill passed by Republicans in Congress last year to roll back an Obama administration regulation adding those who receive Social Security checks for mental illness and deemed unable to handle their own financial affairs to the background-check database.\n\nRep. Ted Deutch, D-Fla., who represents the area where last week's shooting took place, told ABC's This Week on Sunday that he's hopeful the activism of the students at Stoneman Douglas will move the debate forward.\n\n\"They're just not going to sit back after what they experienced,\" Deutch said, \"after what they saw, the worst things imaginable; they're not going to just sit back and take it.\"\n\nFlorida Republican Rep. Carlos Curbelo responded, in part, by saying, \"We've kind of inherited this world of binary choices where we either have to repeal the Second Amendment or have no gun-safety regulations whatsoever, and younger generations of Americans don't see the world that way.\"\n\nWhile Trump has not named any measures he would back to address gun violence since the shooting, he did point the finger at Democrats on Sunday for not enacting gun control when they controlled the White House, Senate and House \u2014 as Republicans do now.\n\n\"Because they didn't want to, and now they just talk!\" was the president's response, even though Republicans blocked several Democratic proposals after the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut. (Check how your member of Congress has voted.)\n\nNow, as President Trump holds listening sessions with students, teachers and law enforcement, the question will be whether he sees action to take beyond talk.", "keywords": ["supports", "trump", "action", "shooting", "gun", "school", "students", "house", "high", "mean", "checks", "president", "background", "improving"], "polarity": 0.03762790072739052, "subjectivity": 0.3278800394616721},

On Tuesday, the nation's top intelligence officials told Congress to expect Russian interference in the upcoming midterm elections and beyond.\n\nThree days later, the Justice Department's Special Counsel, Robert Mueller, filed an indictment against 13 Russians, which laid out in granular detail the size, scope, and complexity of a covert Russian disinformation campaign in 2016.\n\n\"I think people understand that the threat is real and that it's not going away,\" said Secretary Connie Lawson, of Indiana. \"We've always seen security of our voting systems as a priority, it's just become a heightened priority \u2014 I think our biggest concern is that the voters understand that, so they'll have confidence in the election system.\"\n\nAlthough the Mueller indictment did indicate that the Russian goal at a certain point became to propel Donald Trump to the presidency, it highlighted that sowing polarization and feeding a general lack of faith in the democratic process was also important to the Russian operatives.\n\n\"Those who weren't already thinking about that issue, sure are thinking about it now,\" said Secretary Simon.\n\nHis state, Minnesota, was one of 21 states that the Department of Homeland Security says had its voter systems probed by Russia for vulnerabilities leading up to the 2016 election. Hackers only successfully broke into one state system, in Illinois, and did not alter any data, DHS says.\n\nFor months, however, Homeland Security officials failed to inform their election administrators in the 21 states that were targeted, which frustrated officials who said the delay hampered their effort to secure future elections.\n\nThe relationship between state and local officials and the federal government has always been an awkward one; the states are protective of their constitutional right to control how they run their elections but the federal government has both the money and intelligence resources the states often need.\n\nThe National Association of Secretaries of State vehemently opposed then-Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson's decision to designate election systems as \"critical infrastructure\" last year, fearing that it was a step toward the federal government exercising more control over the voting process.\n\nSince then however, election officials say the relationship has softened and that DHS is making an effort to streamline the process of getting relevant information into the hands of state officials. The agency is working toward getting security clearances for three officials in each state, with officials in more than 20 states already approved so far.\n\nThis weekend, national intelligence officials gave a classified briefing to the secretaries about \"increasing awareness of foreign adversary intent and capabilities against the states' election infrastructure,\" according to a joint statement from the FBI, DHS, and the Director of the Office of National Intelligence.\n\n\"I do think the biggest lesson learned from DHS and the federal government in 2016 is that it's not helpful to pass the information down if you're passing it down to the wrong people,\" said Maggie Toulouse Oliver, the Secretary of State of New Mexico, who said that communications with the federal government are drastically improved.\n\nStill, some secretaries were less than impressed with the briefing.\n\n\"We got some new information that was interesting. Did it change the course of what we were going to do or not do [in 2018]? No,\" said Michele Reagan, Arizona's secretary of state, as reported by The Washington Post.\n\nDavid Becker, the executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research, said he heard from some secretaries that \"there was some frustration that some of the information wasn't really new to them, and [intelligence officials] didn't share some information that [the secretaries] really wanted to get deeper on.\"\n\n\"And I'm hoping those kinks get worked out,\" Becker said. \"They need information, both to patch threats and to share it with the electorate.\"\n\nOn a whole, most secretaries felt the communication from the intelligence community had vastly improved over the past year.\n\n\"I've seen a real change,\" said Simon, Minnesota's top election officer. \"I give the Department high marks for understanding the weakness in their initial approach and doing a course correction.\"", "keywords": ["alarm", "officials", "straddle", "intelligence", "security", "chiefs", "sounding", "secretary", "information", "national", "election", "state", "line", "alarmist", "secretaries", "states"], "polarity": 0.11779533883307472, "subjectivity": 0.4632720738381114},

Surgeons also removed 16 lymph nodes from under her armpit and the area around her breast, to see how far the cancer had spread and to determine what further treatment might be needed. Then she underwent radiation therapy.\n\nAs it turned out, the removal of those lymph nodes, along with the radiation, put Harrod at risk for another disorder \u2014 lymphedema, a painful and debilitating swelling of the soft tissue of the arms or legs, and/or an increased vulnerability to infection.\n\nThe lymph system problem she developed months after her surgery was a direct result of her lifesaving cancer treatment.\n\n\"Cancer was a piece of cake,\" Harrod says. \"It was the lymphedema that almost killed me.\"\n\nIn recent years, oncologists have begun paying more attention to the physical, emotional and financial costs of a condition they say is a \"common and underreported complication of cancer treatment.\"\n\nNo longer content to rely on compression clothing and bandages, antibiotics and massaging of limbs to minimize lymphedema's symptoms, some cancer surgeons have been pioneering procedures to restore a healthy lymph system in these patients, or, better yet, prevent the problem.\n\nOften referred to as the body's natural sewage system, the lymph system is a network of nodes \u2014 small filters containing immune cells \u2014 linked by minuscule tubes and channels that carry nutrients around the body and help eliminate dangerous microbes and damaged cells, such as cancer cells.\n\nWhen that lymph network is blocked or otherwise compromised \u2014 by scarring and inflammation from radiation treatments, for example, or by removal of a number of lymph nodes \u2014 fluid can build up in the areas near where the nodes used to be. That's lymphedema.\n\nAs the fluid backs up, and nearby limbs often begin to swell, patients with lymphedema can have difficulty moving \u2014 picking up a grocery bag, or even getting dressed.\n\nFor some people, a sudden infection is the first symptom.\n\nHarrod is a county prosecutor in Kentucky, and was able to return to work just 10 days after her mastectomy. Her recovery from cancer seemed to be proceeding well, she says, until the day \u2014 nine months after the surgery \u2014 when her cat scratched her hand.\n\nShe didn't think much of it, she says, until the next day.\n\n\"My right arm started itching terribly,\" Harrod says, \"and these bizarre little red blisters were forming.\"\n\nHarrod figured it was hives, but her doctor recognized the symptoms as a serious and advancing infection \u2014 cellulitis \u2014 and sent her to the hospital for IV antibiotics.\n\nHarrod was in the hospital for eight days, and that's when she first learned she had lymphedema. Over the next 10 months, she was readmitted twice more with dangerous infections.\n\nHaving even one node removed conveys some risk of lymphedema, doctors say \u2014 perhaps 5 to 7 percent. And medical studies suggest that cancer patients who, like Harrod, have many more nodes removed have about a 20 percent likelihood of developing the disease. Undergoing radiation therapy can increase the risk of lymphedema in those patients to 40 percent.\n\nIt's usually a lifelong condition. Still, many people have never heard of it.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Memorial Sloan Kettering Courtesy of Memorial Sloan Kettering\n\nDr. Joseph H. Dayan, a reconstructive surgeon with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, says he sees patients every week who have survived breast cancer but break down in tears in his office.\n\n\"They're crying, not only because they struggle with lymphedema,\" he says, \"but because many people, including some doctors, do not recognize this as a debilitating condition\" that can require laborious, daily care.\n\n\"People just don't see it,\" Dayan says. \"They don't see the disability.\" Even for many doctors, he says, \"lymphedema is overshadowed by the fact that cancer is the priority.\"\n\nIn 2016, after a third serious infection, Harrod heard from another health care provider that Dayan was successfully transplanting clusters of healthy lymph nodes from unaffected areas of the body.\n\n\"I'm in!\" she decided.\n\nAfter a series of tests ensured she was a good candidate, Harrod had two clusters of nodes transplanted from her abdomen into her armpit and forearm.\n\nFor her, the results have been amazing, Harrod says \u2014 \"like I never, ever had a problem with lymphedema.\"\n\nDayan explains that the node transfer procedure has been around for about a decade; but recent advances in imaging now help surgeons pinpoint which clusters of nodes are best to safely use \u2014 and that can vary from patient to patient.\n\n\"You can actually see the lymphatic system itself \u2014 a delicate, beautiful network of vessels,\" Dayan says.\n\nWhat Lymphedema Looks Like Enlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Courtesy of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center\n\n\"It's like an angiogram of the heart \u2014 you can see any disease, any scarring.\" Even in areas that haven't yet produced obvious pain or swelling.\n\nThe node transfer procedure is not a cure, Dayan says, but it can dramatically reduce the symptoms of lymphedema, especially when the condition is caught early.\n\nMeanwhile, at Montefiore Health System in New York, surgeon Sheldon Marc Feldman has been helping to pioneer another type of surgery \u2014 this one aimed at preventing lymphedema from the get-go. He is the senior author of guidelines developed by a multidisciplinary team on the diagnosis and treatment of lymphedema.\n\nWhen Feldman must remove nodes during cancer surgery, instead of tying off the lymphatic vessels, he reconnects them to a nearby vein, to preserve as much of the body's natural drainage system as possible.\n\n\"So the risk of lymphedema is dramatically reduced,\" Feldman says, among those considered good candidates for the procedure. \"In my study, 4 percent incidence of lymphedema, as opposed to 30 to 40 percent in the group that didn't have it.\"\n\nLuana DeAngelis is one of Feldman's patients. She's 49 and a breast cancer survivor who, after her initial diagnosis in 2004, started a foundation called You Can Thrive to provide treatment information and resources to other cancer survivors.\n\nDeAngelis had worked with Feldman and knew about his research, she says, so when her cancer recurred, and had spread to both breasts, she reached out.\n\n\"I knew if he was going in to remove a lot more lymph nodes that I had a very high risk of lymphedema,\" DeAngelis says. \"And I said to him, 'Please, if you need to go in and take a lot out, let's talk about this lymphovenous bypass.' \"\n\nDeAngelis had 22 lymph nodes removed and \u2014 so far \u2013 has developed no trace of lymphedema.\n\nRight now, lymph node transfer and lymphovenous bypass are performed at only a handful of academic medical centers in the U.S. and about two-dozen around the world. Not all insurance plans cover the cost.\n\nFeldman says he hopes that, as research continues, the advanced surgical techniques will become more widely available \u2014 dramatically reducing a cancer survivor's risk of a debilitating side effect of treatment.", "keywords": ["cancer", "survived", "breast", "nodes", "system", "lymphedema", "lymph", "treatment", "harrod", "sloan", "patients", "risk", "effect", "killed"], "polarity": 0.11100647710874986, "subjectivity": 0.43988318247409164},

The new, court-drawn map is expected to upend that tilt.\n\nJustices described their map in their 48-page decision as \"superior\" to other proposals filed for their consideration.\n\nTop statehouse Republicans have pledged to challenge the judicially enacted map, which they say amounts to overreach by the Democratic-majority court.\n\nThe court's decision comes after a monthlong standoff. When justices first declared the previous map unconstitutional on Jan. 22, they ordered the GOP-controlled legislature and Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, to negotiate a compromise.\n\nThe justices said they wanted the new map to be fairer, specifying that districts should be more compact and contiguous, and should split fewer municipalities.\n\nA compromise map never happened.\n\nAnalysis Ask Cokie: Is Gerrymandering Rigging America's Political System? Ask Cokie: Is Gerrymandering Rigging America's Political System? Listen \u00b7 4:42 4:42\n\nUltimately, House and Senate Republicans, House Democrats, Senate Democrats, Wolf and Lt. Gov.

All parties to the case were technically allowed to file maps.\n\nThe submitted maps varied significantly in terms of partisan advantage, though overall they all made districts more compact, and to varying degrees they divided fewer municipalities.\n\nThe various parties to the case approached the redistricting process differently. House and Senate Republicans worked largely with existing staff members who have previous Pennsylvania mapping experience. They said they didn't take partisanship into consideration at all, and ended up with a map with a relatively similar GOP advantage to the current one.\n\nOn the other hand, Wolf, the governor, hired Tufts University professor Moon Duchin to consult on his map. Her analysis, the governor said, found that the map has \"no partisan skew in comparison to over a billion randomly generated maps.\"\n\nThe justices were advised by Nathan Persily, a Stanford law professor with a background in drawing political district maps. He has previously assisted judges in New York, Connecticut, North Carolina, Georgia and Maryland in redistricting cases.\n\n\"We're going to have a Stanford professor come into Pennsylvania, and he's going to act as the prosecutor by presenting the evidence, he's going to act as the juror by evaluating the evidence, and he solely is going to act as a judge by ultimately ruling on the evidence and producing a map \u2014 one person \u2014 to the court for the people of Pennsylvania to live under,\" state Senate Majority Leader Jake Corman said in advance of today's announcement.\n\nRepublicans also are calling the process foul.

The map that they ultimately submitted was from the legislature's two GOP leaders.\n\nStatehouse Republicans say the court is usurping the power of the legislative and executive branches, a situation that essentially creates a \"constitutional crisis.\"", "keywords": ["democrats", "advantage", "submitted", "senate", "republicans", "voting", "wolf", "going", "shift", "pennsylvania", "courtdrawn", "professor", "map", "court"], "polarity": 0.07664502164502165, "subjectivity": 0.40857413419913413},

It's the most common sexually transmitted virus and infection in the U.S.\n\nIn women, HPV infection can lead to cervical cancer, which leads to about 4,000 deaths per year. In men, it can cause penile cancer. HPV also causes some cases of oral cancer, cancer of the anus and genital warts.\n\nThe CDC says HPV vaccination can prevent many of these cancers, and urges pediatricians to recommend HPV vaccination for all their patients, beginning at age 11.\n\nBut a new analysis from the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association finds only 29 percent of the teens its members insure receive a first dose of the HPV vaccine by their 13th birthday. And the CDC finds, nationally, only 43 percent of teens are up-to-date on all the recommended doses of the vaccine.\n\n\"It's important for 12 and 13-year-olds to get the HPV vaccine to provide immunity so that when they may be exposed to HPV later in life, typically through sexual activity, they have protection, says Dr. Margaret Stager, of the Metro Health Medical Center in Cleveland. She's a pediatrician and spokesperson for the American Academy of Pediatrics.\n\nThe CDC summarizes the transmission of the virus bluntly: \"People get HPV from another person during intimate sexual contact. Most of the time, people get HPV from having vaginal or anal sex. Men and women can also get HPV from having oral sex or other sex play.\"\n\nHPV immunization rates have been rising in the decade or so since the first vaccine became available, but pediatricians still hear pushback from some parents. Stager says she's heard questions such as: \"Why are we giving this vaccine to my [11-year-old] girl? She's not going to be having sex \u2014 so why are we doing this now?\"\n\nThere are two reasons to vaccinate at this age. First, there's a more effective immune response if it is given in early adolescence. And second: \"It works best if given before any sexual exposure.\"\n\nThough gender differences in vaccine rates have narrowed, more girls than boys get the HPV vaccine. This may be because the recommendation to vaccinate boys began in 2011, years after it was first recommended for girls.\n\nMeanwhile, it's clear that males are getting HPV-related cancers. \"We're seeing a trend in adult men with oral cancers related to HPV,\" says Stager. These oropharyngeal cancers occur in the back of the throat, including the base of the tongue and tonsils. Oral HPV cancer is much more common in men than women.\n\n\"This is the [age] group of men that did not have the opportunity to get the HPV vaccine,\" she says.\n\nSo what's the connection between HPV and oral cancer? \"It's related to oral sex,\" Stager explains.\n\nThe CDC has documented an increase in the cases of HPV-related cancers in men in recent years, with a significant increase in oropharyngeal cancer.\n\n\"The fastest growing segment of the oral and oropharyngeal cancer population are otherwise healthy, nonsmokers in the 25-50 age range,\" according to the Oral Cancer Foundation.\n\nFor young men and women, it may not be too late to get the vaccine.\n\nThe CDC says those who missed being vaccinated as teenagers, can still benefit from getting the HPV vaccine through their early and mid-20s.", "keywords": ["teenagers", "cancer", "dont", "cdc", "washington", "sex", "prevent", "oral", "vaccine", "cancers", "women", "men", "hpv"], "polarity": 0.16705288175876404, "subjectivity": 0.43538324420677366},

He says Japan's brutal colonization of Korea from 1910 to 1945 is never quite history for South Koreans. In sports, \"Beating Japan is certainly on the minds of South Koreans, and not losing to South Korea is on the minds of the Japanese.\"\n\nFor fans from these neighboring countries with a troubled past, the Sunday speed skating matchup was the one to watch. Hikaru Takamizawa came to the games from Osaka to catch it.\n\n\"We have to win Korea always,\" Takamizawa says. He adds the rivalry was ingrained around the same time he learned how to read. \"I was 6 or 7 years old.\"\n\nThe jostling in sports mirrors what's happening with the larger Japan-South Korea relationship lately. Japanese diplomats filed a formal complaint against its neighbor after South Korea put tiny contested islands (which in the U.S. are called the Liancourt Rocks) on the white unified Korea flag used during these games. The North Korea issue is coming between the two countries leaders too \u2014 resulting in a tense meeting between Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and South Korean President Moon Jae-in, over military drills on the peninsula.\n\n\"Moon more or less told him to butt out, this is a domestic matter and he would make the call,\" Kingston said, of the meeting. He describes the relationship as somewhere between cold and frosty right now.\n\n\"So it was amazing to me that the NBC commentator at the Opening Ceremony decided it was just the right time to remind everybody,\" Kingston said.\n\nIf you missed the mistake \u2014 NBC's commentator Joshua Ramos said, \"Every Korean will tell you that Japan is cultural, and technological and economic example, has been so important to their own transformation.\" It led to a near immediate online petition and NBC's swift apology.\n\n\"First of all it's untrue,\" Kingston says. \"And the timing of it, when South Korea is hosting the Olympics, it was just astounding cluelessness.\"\n\nHere in the region, the rivalry is so internalized that it brought North and South Korea together. The coach of the unified Korean hockey team said success for her team \u2014 would mean beating Japan. The team lost \u2014 but won over Koreans by scoring their only goal of the Olympics when it mattered \u2014 against Japan.\n\nIn the speed skating showdown \u2014 Japan's Kodaira edged out Korea's Lee by .39 of a second, winning a gold to Lee's silver. Moments after, Kodaira skated over to a shaken and sobbing Lee, and pulled her close. They skated side-by-side, draped in their respective countries' flags.

Go Team USA!!!\"\n\nThe change of heart seemed to catch NBC by surprise. The network had announced (in a since-removed statement: see cached version) that it was hiring Rippon on Sunday, sending out a tweet with his photo and saying, \"Welcome to the NBC team.\" But Rippon decided he wasn't ready to leave his current team; NBC's tweet has now been deleted.\n\nRippon has made headlines because of his status as one of the first openly gay U.S. athletes to compete in the Olympics \u2014 and because of his performances under pressure during the U.S. team figure skating event (where he won a bronze medal) and his men's singles event (in which he finished 10th).\n\nRippon has been busy \u2014 seemingly too busy to realize he had a new prospective day job.

That test is being carried out around midday Monday in South Korea \u2014 Sunday night in the continental U.S.\n\nInternational Olympic Committee Communications Director Mark Adams said on Monday that he cannot comment on a specific athlete or sport under suspicion, as \"the testing and sanctioning is independent of the IOC.\"\n\nAdams wasn't sure when the next test results would be released, saying, \"I've heard that the B sample will be opened today, around lunchtime.\"\n\nThe testing is currently in the hands of the Doping-Free Sport Unit, which is part of the Global Association of International Sports Federations, an IOC-recognized group that's based in Switzerland. World Curling Federation President Kate Caithness is a member of the GAISF Council.\n\nIf the result is confirmed, it would then be up to the OAR Implementation Group to report its findings to the IOC's executive board at the end of the Winter Games \u2014 a little over one week from now.\n\nThe World Curling Federation says it learned of the preliminary test result through media reports; a spokesman said the governing body will not comment at this time.\n\nThe failed doping test was first reported by a Russian sports radio station; it was then confirmed to state-run Tass media by a spokesman from the Olympic Athletes from Russia delegation in South Korea.\n\nKrushelnitckii won bronze in the new mixed-doubles tournament, along with his teammate and wife, Anastasia Bryzgalova. He's suspected of using meldonium, which the World Anti-Doping Agency has prohibited as a \"hormone and metabolic modulator.\" It was formally put on the banned list in 2016, with WADA citing \"evidence of clear abuse of the substance.\"\n\nElite athletes had used meldonium, a prescription heart drug, for years before it was finally banned. It's the drug for which Maria Sharapova tested positive, resulting in a lengthy ban from tennis.\n\nBefore it was banned, meldonium was seen as a \"legal doping\" substance \u2014 a prescription drug believed to boost performance but that for decades wasn't prohibited, as NPR's Jon Hamilton reported during the Sharapova case in 2016.\n\nWhen asked if the incident might shake the confidence of other athletes in Pyeongchang, who had been reassured that all of their Russian rivals had been held to intense testing and standards, Adams said, \"It's extremely disappointing for us, if a case is proven.\"\n\n\"On the other hand,\" Adams said, it would also show that the doping control system is effective and reliable.\n\nThere are reports that Krushelnitckii has turned in his accreditation and left the site of the Winter Games; Adams said on Monday that he had heard those reports but had not received confirmation.\n\nEven if a drug is banned, athletes can be cleared to take it, if they can prove a need for therapeutic use (to do so, they apply for a \"Therapeutic Use Exemption\" \u2014 or TUE). There is no sign that Krushelnitckii had such an exemption.\n\nIn the case of meldonium, toxicologist Olivier Rabin, WADA's science director, told NPR in 2016 that when the drug was placed on a monitoring list, \"it quickly came to our attention that there were clear patterns of use by entire teams, which usually suggests a drug isn't being taken for medical purposes. How could every member of a team need the same medical treatment?\"\n\n\"Among athletes, meldonium is used with the purpose of increasing recovery rate or exercise performance\" the British Journal of Sports Medicine wrote last year. \"The benefit of taking meldonium in view of performance enhancement in athletes is quite speculative and is discussed without sound scientific evidence.\"\n\nThe IOC suspended the Russian Olympic Committee in December, over systematic doping. It then convened a panel to scrutinize Russian athletes who wanted to compete in South Korea; in the end, 168 Russians came to compete, under a neutral flag, in generic uniforms, and under the name Olympic Athlete from Russia.", "keywords": ["pyeongchang", "olympics", "curler", "meldonium", "drug", "athletes", "winter", "result", "test", "doping", "banned", "russian", "olympic", "suspected"], "polarity": 0.05970538720538721, "subjectivity": 0.33668911335578},

But despite days of debate and numerous proposals, senators were not able to pass a concrete immigration solution.\n\nFour separate immigration measures failed in the Senate.\n\nPart of the conundrum is that President Trump seems unwilling to sign any bill that does not include a commitment to narrowing legal immigration, after originally saying he would pass any bill that lawmakers could agree on.\n\nIf Congress does not come up with a solution soon, and the courts don't offer some clarity, some 700,000 people protected from deportation under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA) could lose their status.\n\nAssumption versus reality\n\nImmigration appears thoroughly ingrained in the Democratic brand. When the center-left think tank Third Way conducted surveys after the 2016 election with voters, nearly all of them pointed to the same thing.\n\n\"When we asked people what Democrats stood for, immigration was one of the biggest words that came up in the word cloud that people used to discuss Democrats,\" said Lanae Erickson Hatalsky, vice president for social policy and politics at Third Way. \"[Immigration] was a mainstay of how people saw the Democratic Party.\"\n\nAnd so the logical conclusion ahead of the 2016 presidential election was that Trump's unfriendly immigration rhetoric would help Democrats.\n\n\"One of the things that many analysts had pointed to is Donald Trump's comments about immigrants, particularly Mexican immigrants, might motivate Latino voters to turn out in record numbers,\" explained Mark Hugo Lopez, the director of Hispanic Research at the Pew Research Center.\n\nThat did not exactly happen. For one thing, the top issue for Latino voters \u2014 like all voters \u2014 was the economy. And the Latino turnout rate actually declined compared from 48 percent in 2012 to 47.6 percent in 2016.\n\nDespite the assumption that immigration is a pillar of the Democratic Party, in the last presidential election, it galvanized Republicans far more than Democrats.\n\ntoggle caption National Exit Polls\n\nTrump voters\n\nPresident Trump made immigration the backbone of his campaign.\n\n\"When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best,\" Trump said at his 2015 campaign announcement. \"They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.\"\n\nTrump successfully moved immigration into the core of the Republican Party's identity.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Republican and Democrats were almost entirely in sync with how they felt about immigrants' contributions to the country, but as Democrats have become more progressive, Republicans have become more conservative.\n\nLoading...\n\nAmong 2016 voters who said \"the most important issue facing the country\" was immigration, they heavily favored Trump \u2014 64 percent to 32 percent \u2014 according to the exit polls.\n\nRepublican pollster Whit Ayres believes that immigration is politically potent not so much on its own, but as symbolic of broader emotional issues that affect the GOP base.\n\n\"For opponents of immigration, the issue taps into economic pressures that could damage the blue-collar middle class, as well as fears that we're losing our culture \u2014 a country that's spoken English since its founding is becoming bilingual,\" he explained. \"Don't underestimate ... the frustration of many Trump voters that we are losing our country. And that we are fundamentally changing it in ways that are unlike anything we've had in the past.\"\n\ntoggle caption National Exit Polls\n\nJohn Sides, a political science professor at George Washington University, conducted a survey after the 2016 election where he interviewed the same voters he had spoken with in 2012 \u2014 so he knew how they felt about immigration and he also knew how they had voted.\n\n\"One of the reasons why Trump was able to win ... was by using the issue of immigration to pull some white Obama voters over to his side,\" explained Sides. His research found that about a quarter to a third of white Obama voters in 2012 had fairly conservative positions on immigration.\n\n\"We were able to show among white voters there were only a handful of things that were more strongly related to their choice between Trump and Clinton than their choice between Obama and Romney, and those things had to do with their views of race, and their views of immigration, and their views of Muslims,\" Sides said.\n\nWhat history tells us\n\nSo maybe heated rhetoric alone does not turn out voters, but Lopez says policy changes might, such as when the DACA program was first introduced the summer before President Obama's re-election.\n\n\"Obama in 2012 was under this cloud of being a 'deporter-in-chief,' \u2014 at least many Latino leaders had described him as such,\" said Lopez. \"So when he does DACA many analysts say that was just enough the motivator to get many Hispanics who were perhaps on the fence about voting out to vote.\"\n\nBut even if there was a post-DACA bump, it was a minor bump.\n\nChris Zepeda-Mill\u00e1n, a political scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, says history proves that Latinos are more likely to mobilize against a legislative threat than for legislative action. He points to the mass Latino mobilization in 2006 because of the Sensenbrenner bill, which threatened to make it a federal crime to aid someone who entered the country illegally.\n\n\"Latinos tend to come and out vote, and immigrants, when there's anti-immigrant legislation on the ballot,\" said Zepeda-Mill\u00e1n. \"We saw this in California. We've seen it in other states as well. When there's anti-immigrant legislation looming, Latinos tend to come out at higher rates.\"\n\nA similar thing happened in California in the 1990s when Republicans backed Proposition 187, a ballot measure to deny public services to people in the country illegally.\n\nMidterm consequences\n\nThe key difference between Donald Trump's election and the upcoming midterms is that it's a fundamentally different political landscape.

Such cuts would mean \"massive layoffs and disruptions,\" says Mike Calhoun, the president of the Center for Responsible Lending. That would \"make it hard for it to do its job \u2014 a job that it's been doing incredibly well,\" he says.\n\nFinancial watchdog groups such as Calhoun's say the agency has been paying for itself many times over. Part of its mission is to go after companies that swindle consumers to get people their money back, \"so far returning over $12 billion in relief to consumers who were treated illegally by financial companies,\" Calhoun says. So in that sense, the CFPB is returning far more money to taxpayers than it's costing them.\n\nBut some Republicans think the bureau is too powerful and has been too aggressive in crafting new regulations and suing financial firms. And President Trump appointed one of the agency's harshest critics to be its interim director.\n\nAs a congressman, Mick Mulvaney sponsored legislation to abolish the CFPB, and he still doesn't speak very highly of the agency he's leading. Speaking on CBS' Face the Nation, Mulvaney said the CFPB \"has no accountability to Congress. It is perhaps the most unaccountable bureau or agency there is.\"\n\nHe said he wants to run the agency \"with a good deal of humility and prudence.\" But critics say Mulvaney is not being humble, he's being reckless.\n\nUnder Mulvaney, the bureau has put on hold new regulations for high-interest payday lenders. And it's dropped an investigation into a a payday lender that contributed to Mulvaney's campaign when he was in Congress. Mulvaney has said he doesn't think those contributions create a conflict of interest.\n\nAnd now Mulvaney has proposed steep budget cuts. He says he's not \"gutting\" the agency, but Democrats vow they won't take the move sitting down.\n\n\"We will fight any effort to defund the CFPB,\" says Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md. Van Hollen pressed Mulvaney in a hearing this week about the agency head's decision to drop a lawsuit against an online lender called Golden Valley. The lawsuit said the lender is charging illegal and predatory interest rates.\n\nVan Hollen: \"950 percent interest rates. ... this is higher than Mafia loan sharks. Were you part of the decision to drop the case against Golden Valley?\" Mulvaney: \"Yes sir.\" Van Hollen: \"I'll follow up with that. I think it's an outrageous decision.\"\n\nVan Hollen says an NPR report this week prompted him to start looking into the lender. That report said Mulvaney dropped the lawsuit even though the entire professional career staff at the bureau wanted to press ahead with the case.\n\nVan Hollen says he wants a full accounting from Mulvaney about why he did that. \"It's pretty clear right now, if left to their own devices, Mulvany and the Trump administration will essentially turn the keys to the agency over to the very people who are cheating consumers,\" Van Hollen says.\n\nThe CFPB gets its funding from the Federal Reserve, not Congress. But if Mulvaney tries to slash its budget, Mike Calhoun of the Center for Responsible Lending says Congress could act to block the move.\n\nPolls show that the CFPB is popular with voters of both parties.

Lauderdale, and many more injured, on Valentine's Day. The suspect is a 19-year-old former student who was reportedly expelled from the school. As we've reported, schools around the country have adopted procedures for active shooter situations. In a radio interview, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos called for Congressional hearings on the issue: \"one of these shootings is one too many.\"\n\nNew Trump budget wish list has cuts to education\n\nLast year, President Trump released a 2018 budget proposal with more than $9 billion in cuts to education. That didn't happen. Instead, there were two brief government shutdowns, followed by a two-year, $300 billion, soup-to-nuts spending deal signed on February 9.\n\nNevertheless, though Congress has essentially already written the checks for 2019, there is now a new, 2019 Trump budget proposal.\n\nThis one calls for around $4 billion in cuts to education, including $2 billion in cuts to teacher training and $1.2 billion from afterschool and summer learning programs. It also puts half a billion toward school choice.\n\nAlthough it may seem like an empty exercise given events, think of this proposal as a preview of coming attractions \u2014 an indicator of desires amongst lawmakers that may find expression in other ways. Like the new Higher Education Act, currently under debate. Both the current HEA and this proposal would ax Public Service Loan Forgiveness going forward, among other new limitations on federal student aid.\n\n\n\nUndocumented youth chose school, work because of DACA, study says\n\nThe Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program has \"had a significant impact\" on the decisions of undocumented youth, in a way that benefits society at large. That's the conclusion of a new working paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research. Compared to a control group, high school graduation rates among all DACA recipients increased by 15 percent after the change in the law, while college attendance increased by 25 percent among women only. In addition to going to school more often, DACA recipients also worked more.\n\nTransgender student rights, revisited\n\nThe Education Department said this week that it will not intervene on behalf of transgender students who have been prohibited from using school bathrooms that match their gender identity. The news was first reported by Buzzfeed News and confirmed by NPR.\n\nA year and a half ago, the Obama administration advised school districts that transgender students should be allowed to use the bathrooms of their gender identity under the Title IX civil rights law. The Education Department, under Secretary Betsy DeVos, quickly rescinded that guidance.\n\nNow, spokesperson Liz Hill confirms the Department's position in a statement:\n\n\"Title IX prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, not gender identity. Therefore the question is whether a student (regardless of gender identity) has been discriminated against on the basis of sex. Where students, including transgender students, are penalized or harassed for failing to conform to sex-based stereotypes, that is sex discrimination prohibited by Title IX. In the case of bathrooms, however, longstanding regulations provide that separating facilities on the basis of sex is not a form of discrimination prohibited by Title IX.\"\n\nSeveral courts have disagreed with that reading of the law. In a statement, Sarah Warbelow of the Human Rights Campaign called the Department's inaction \"reprehensible\" and argued that \"[its] failure to act conflicts with the law in multiple jurisdictions, including federal circuits, and further emboldens those who seek to discriminate against transgender students.\"\n\nCourt rules Alabama school district case \"discriminatory\"\n\nA federal appeals court found that a mostly-white suburb, Gardendale, Ala., can't secede to form its own school district separate from more-diverse Jefferson County. The judges' opinion upheld the district court finding that:\n\n\"the Gardendale Board acted with a discriminatory purpose to exclude black children from the proposed school system.\"\n\nThe head of the school board said they would appeal and denied racial motivations for the move.\n\nThe county has been under federal oversight that originally dates back to a 1965 desegregation case.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, which took an in-depth look at this case last fall, Gardendale's efforts are part of a trend toward resegregation: \"Since 2000, at least 71 communities across the country, most of them white and wealthy, have sought to break away from their public-school districts to form smaller, more exclusive ones.\"\n\nThe Gates letter, vol. 10\n\nOn Tuesday, the Gates Foundation released its 10th annual letter, and this year, Bill and Melinda Gates used it to answer \"The 10 Toughest Questions We Get.\" Question No. 2 is a doozy. They've spent billions of dollars on U.S. education (including supporting NPR's coverage). What do they have to show for it?\n\n\"A lot, but not as much as either of us would like,\" writes Bill. The Foundation has focused much of its attention on efforts to improve outcomes for high-schoolers, and Gates celebrates its role in pushing, many years ago, for a more honest grad-rate calculation. But he admits the Foundation also struggled in its efforts to improve struggling schools with top-down reforms.\n\n\"It's extremely hard to transform low-performing schools,\" Bill writes. \"Overall they didn't perform as well as newly created schools.\"\n\nIn October, the Foundation announced a major shift in its education efforts. After spending hundreds of millions of dollars to promote controversial new methods of evaluating teachers, for example, the Foundation said it would no longer invest directly in new evaluation initiatives.

I picked it up from the bookstore of a church I was invited to in my late teens.

In other words, how to learn to be the \"salt of the earth.\"\n\nThe Gospels by Manuscripts Paperback, Box Set | purchase close overlay Buy Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How?\n\nWhile the environment was certainly foreign to me at the time, what kept me coming back to the youth group were the words: The scriptures, with their psalms and lyrical exhortations, tugged at a wayward misfit who had an affinity for poetry and vivid prose. Since then, I've owned dozens of Bibles in various translations and languages.\n\nYou don't have to look hard to notice the Bible has been marketed to fit nearly every person and interest. There are editions dedicated specifically for men, women, toddlers, athletes, military wives, and people in Twelve-Step recovery programs \u2014 each edition emphasizing relevant passages and often featuring commentary from religious scholars or well-known personalities. Sometimes they're a bit much \u2014 the Patriot's Bible, for one, is a damn shame that wears its racism and twisted view of patriotism on its proverbial sleeves \u2014 but other times they succeed in helping bring the text to life.\n\nBut they all have something in common: Nearly every Bible I've ever come across, with a few exceptions \u2014 the ESV Reader's Bible, for example, which presents scripture as one extended storyline \u2014 has functioned as a kind of reference book. The numbered-verse structure, a relatively recent convention, has had its fair share of critics for centuries: Ancient manuscripts didn't contain these divisions that have become so familiar to modern readers. But there's also been a surge of interest in engaging with the Bible in the same way you would a novel, free of footnotes and asides.\n\nThat's the approach taken by the small team behind Manuscripts, a new version of the Bible in the form of individual pocket-sized volumes \u2013 the first of which are coming out this month after a successful crowdfunding campaign.\n\n\"Our research showed us that people were often intimidated by how it's traditionally been presented; as one big book,\" says Manuscripts creative director Jacob Scowden. \"We wanted to give an ease to it, and reemphasize the effectiveness of reading the Bible as individual books.\"\n\nManuscripts is beginning with the Gospels \u2014 Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John \u2014 a spiritual biography of sorts chronicling Jesus's life, teachings, and ministry. In their version, each section of text is arranged in a single column, devoid of verse numbers and footnotes, so it reads less like a textbook.\n\nWhile having passages broken down into manageable chunks can prove useful in certain contexts, it can also make it harder to figure out the author's original intent. (And though the Bible's authorship, and authorial intent for that matter, brings its own set of questions, it's still an argument worth noting.) But who still reads the Bible, anyway? And who might benefit from something like what Manuscripts offers? A 2017 survey by the Christian research firm (and bookstore chain) LifeWay showed that 1 in 5 Americans have read the entire Bible at least once, with 9 percent claiming to have read it through multiple times.\n\nAlthough the content remains familiar and unchanged, it feels, somewhat surprisingly, like I've discovered something new.\n\nAs I skim through the pages of the Manuscripts book of Luke, I can't help but wonder if those numbers would climb considerably, just on the basis of its simplicity. It's easy to read and functions, to my mind, like a piece of literature. Plus, it's much easier to engage with than that first Bible I got from the church bookstore all those years ago.\n\nJon Hernandez, a friend and executive minister at Concord First Assembly in North Carolina, tells me Manuscripts could be a useful tool to help expand the Bible's readership, especially among millennials. \"For a generation consuming information in 140 characters or less, anything that can make the scriptures more approachable is welcomed.\" He has a point.\n\nAs someone who has read the Bible for years and yet always found its presentation daunting, this is something I didn't know I wanted. Something I can breeze through in minutes and yet still feel enriched by the text. Although the content remains familiar and unchanged, it feels, somewhat surprisingly, like I've discovered something new.\n\nJuan Vidal is a writer and critic for NPR Books.

She learned a lot about the American criminal justice system. She knew all the grim statistics. But she was still searching for the inspiration for a novel she'd hope to write: one that involved an individual's encounter with the system, and the subsequent ripples that touch that person's community.\n\nThen, while she was in Atlanta visiting her mother, she found what she needed during a routine trip to the shopping mall.\n\n\"I overheard a couple arguing,\" she remembers. \"The woman was beautifully dressed, cashmere coat, the whole nine.\"\n\nThe young man having the heated discussion? Jones says, \"He looked fine, but she looked great. And she said to him 'Roy, you know you wouldn't have waited on me for seven years.' And he said 'I don't know what you're talking about; this wouldn't have happened to you in the first place!\"\n\nAnd right there, something clicked; Tayari Jones found what she needed, and began work on An American Marriage.\n\nIt's a story of love and loyalty and race and justice and what happens when the unthinkable happens to \"normal\" people. Roy and Celestial Hamilton are those people \u2014 a young African-American golden couple who met on the campus of their historically black college. They marry soon after graduation and seem poised for success: he's a rising corporate executive, she's a promising artist. Then, on a visit to his parents in tiny Eloe, Louisiana, Roy is falsely accused of a terrible crime.\n\nTayari Jones says Roy's struggle against his fate reminds her of a contemporary version of an ancient story.\n\n\"This book in many ways, was inspired by the Odyssey,\" Jones says. \"Roy is like Odysseus \u2014 he has this huge challenge and he has to travel this journey ... and he just wants to find a clean home and a faithful wife waiting on him at the other end.\"\n\nBut Celestial is no Penelope; she is a modern woman who can't just sit and wait for her man. She has a business to run (she makes one-of-a kind dolls, the kind museums collect...) and she needs to figure out what's going to happen for the rest of her life. No one knows how long Roy will be behind bars, or whether he will ever be exonerated.\n\nRoy's incarceration has an effect far beyond him and Celestial. Both sets of parents are heavily invested in his defense \u2014 and in the preservation of their children's marriage. In creating her storyline, Jones wanted people to understand that for black Americans, \"Injustice in the criminal justice system \u2014 it's just in the air. Like hurricanes if you live on the East Coast or earthquakes if you live out West. It's just something that is.\" The possibility of being snapped up into the system is always there, hovering.\n\nEven if you've never gotten so much as a traffic ticket. One mistaken identification, one careless follow-up, and like Roy, you can become part of the country's prison-industrial complex.\n\nBut Jones wanted Roy to be more than a symbol of black male vulnerability. \"When you're in love, love is not about symbolism, it's about individuals,\" she insists.\n\nRoy and Celestial try to remain connected via a series of letters, communication that turns out to be increasingly hard to maintain over time. (Jones herself is a prolific letter writer, so she drew on that skill for the couple's correspondence.) It gets even harder as their best friend, Andre, becomes both cherished support and emotional complication.\n\nJones says she hopes readers of An American Marriage don't divide themselves into Team Roy, Team Celestial, Team Andre. It's not about picking sides.\n\n\"I really hope people who read this book will find themselves unsure of which character they identify with the most,\" she says. \"I just want readers to walk away thinking, 'This situation is more complicated than I thought.'\"", "keywords": ["roy", "criminal", "love", "system", "jones", "justice", "american", "marriage", "redefining", "team", "celestial"], "polarity": 0.0875667951839827, "subjectivity": 0.46878720238095234},

A long list of authors and artists were honored for works of fiction and nonfiction for kids and young adults. The awards that always draw the most excitement and attention are the Caldecott and Newbery medals, as NPR's Lynn Neary reports.\n\nLYNN NEARY, BYLINE: A gathering of true believers was on hand today to hear the announcement of the awards at the ALA's annual midwinter meeting.

Kelly says the story reflects some of what she herself experienced as a young girl.\n\nKELLY: You know, when I grew up, I was the only Filipino in my school. And it was - you know, I felt very much like an outsider. So that's something that's also really important to me is to write books that celebrate the underdog, that celebrate characters who might be underestimated or who might be - feel like they're alone in the world.\n\nNEARY: Kelly says she's still stunned by the award.\n\nKELLY: It's incredibly overwhelming to know that that little girl that I was, you know, when I was 9 or 10, writing books and feeling like that little alone girl, now has been bestowed, you know, the highest honor in children's literature that you can possibly receive. I mean, it's really hard to put into words what that means for me.\n\nMATTHEW CORDELL: I was speechless. Like, I - for the first time in my life that I can think of I had no words. I couldn't put together a sentence.\n\nNEARY: Matthew Cordell was honored with a Caldecott medal for best picture book for \"Wolf In The Snow.\" It's a story that turns the Little Red Riding Hood tale on its head, though Cordell says that wasn't intentional. It began as a single image.\n\nCORDELL: The picture was a girl in a red coat, and she was standing in a snowy field. And she's looking across that field, very - not too far from her - standing a - an adult wolf.\n\nNEARY: \"Wolf In The Snow\" is what's known as a wordless book because there's no text. The pictures tell the whole story.\n\nCORDELL: Of all the books and stories I've created, this was one I felt like didn't need the text. The text was really just kind of getting in the way. Yeah, so this was my first crack at a wordless book. But now I've sort of got the bug, so I'm working on another wordless book right now.\n\nNEARY: After catching their breath, both Cordell and Kelly hope to celebrate. Though Kelly says first, she plans to clean her house. Lynn Neary, NPR News, Washington.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF NOBODY'S \"WAKE UP AND SMELL THE MILLENIUM\")\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.

And it was this shapely beautiful woman, and at first I didn't know who it was. And then I realized it was my wife.

I spent more time with Kayak than anyone else over the past 10 years. He was my best friend and closest companion. He was my stability. ... Soon after I left Oregon for our last move together, I found out that his kidneys were failing and he passed soon after, in my arms. One of my friends told me she wished she could have given him her kidney and I, too, would have done this in a heartbeat if it would have saved him.\n\n\u2014 Angie Seligman (Bismarck, N.D.)\n\nAlexander recommends \"A Dog Has Died\" by Pablo Neruda. He says, \"I thought Angie really captured her relationship with Kayak, with her dog. It sort of showed this bond that they had.

And I felt like with this poem he could really offer some hope, some cheer, some pleasant memory to Angie and to all of us.\"\n\nNow that my daughter has moved out of the house to live in her college dorms, my man and I have entered a new chapter of our relationship where we are truly equal life partners. We enjoy lazy Saturday mornings, linger over Home Depot runs, explore local foodie hot spots for weekly date nights and plan the occasional getaway from work to explore a new city or a new culture. ...

A winged angel flew in at the end of the first half, and that was after the action had leapt from Manhattan to Salt Lake City to Antarctica.\n\nImagine the actors' reactions at that first read-through. Actually, you don't have to imagine because in their oral history The World Only Spins Forward, authors Isaac Butler and Dan Kois got them to talk about it.\n\nActress Lori Holt, for instance, who played the Valium-popping wife of a gay Republican Mormon in one of the earliest Angels workshops at San Francisco's Eureka Theater Company, read her journal entries to the authors.\n\n\"I wrote in my journal, December of '88: 'The script is outrageously long, the first part alone is 200 pages plus.'\"\n\nTwo hundred pages-plus of laughter, fury, anguish, poetry, drag queens, closeted lawyers, Mormons, and \u2014 especially \u2014 politics. And that was just the first half. Today, the plays are a known quantity, having won a Pulitzer Prize, inspired a multi-part HBO adaptation, and having been produced, published, and taught the world over for 25 years. But in the early 1990s, there was a very real question as to whether an audience would even get it. No one knew for sure. Including, the authors discovered, the playwright.\n\n\"Opening night, which is critics night,\" Kushner told them, \"is like performing at a stenographer's convention. Nobody laughs. It's horrible. And then they all go home and write their reviews, and the reviews come out.\"\n\nOpening night, which is critics night, is like performing at a stenographer's convention. Nobody laughs. It's horrible.\n\nHe's talking here about the first London production, before there was any talk about bringing Angels to New York. He and director Declan Donnellan had disagreed strenuously about the staging. Emotions were running high, and the director told the cast he didn't want anyone to read the reviews. They were all going to meet up at a bar \u2014 and actors being actors, one went to a newsstand on the way to the bar and arrived with an armload of newspapers. Once they'd been plunked on a table, Donnelan forgot all about his instructions and started reading them aloud, sight unseen.\n\n\"Tony was sort of shriveling on the other side of the table,\" Donnellan recalls. \"And I read all these reviews, and they were all total raves. And then I realized what an awful, risky thing I'd done.\" '\n\nThe book weaves together this sort of in-the-moment remembrance with the reactions of everyone from critics, to gay former Rep. Barney Frank. Its oral history consists of a sort of tapestry of snippets from almost 250 interviews, arranged in chapters that deal with the show's development, its casting, its reception, and its legacy. The point is not just to show how this play found its voice, but also to place it in context. Angels was a product of, and was dramatizing, a moment when the purple splotch of Kaposi's Sarcoma \u2014 evidence of a compromised immune system \u2014 amounted to a death sentence.\n\nOne of the play's more telling scenes finds Prior and Lewis \u2014 the central gay couple played by Stephen Spinella and Joe Mantello in the original Broadway production \u2014 coming to terms with that fact. Prior shows Lewis a splotch on his arm, and Lewis responds, \"That is just a burst blood vessel.\"\n\n\"Not according to the best medical authorities,\" demurs Prior as Lewis dissolves in sobs. \"K.S. baby. Lesion number 1, the wine dark kiss of the angel of death, I'm a lesionaire, the foreign lesion. The American lesion. Lesionaire's disease. My troubles are lesion ... Don't you think I'm handling this well? I'm going to die.\"\n\nMantello, now celebrated as the director of the smash musical Wicked, is devastated (and devastating) in that scene, which more or less introduced him to audiences. He was, he tells the authors, so unskilled at auditioning that he was \"virtually unhireable\" before Angels opened on Broadway in 1993.\n\n\"It wasn't like a natural progression,\" he says, \"of somebody who had been working a lot off-Broadway. It was really: very few acting jobs ... Angels in America.\"\n\nToday, the play attracts much bigger names. Celebrated Broadway headliner Nathan Lane will play closeted lawyer/moral monster Roy Cohn in the 25th anniversary Broadway revival, and movie star Andrew Garfield, who not long ago was Hollywood's amazing Spider-Man, will wear \"the wine-dark kiss of the angel of death.\" The book's authors asked Garfield to comment on how his own sexuality affects playing a now-iconic gay character\n\n\"I, as far as I know, am a heterosexual male in a heterosexual male's body. And I'm not confused about that. And of course, the responsibility of taking on this role in a seminal play \u2014 a seminal gay play \u2014 filled me with joy. Because I knew deep down it was going to be fine. But just above that deep down was a layer of terror, of: 'I'm the wrong person for this.'\"\n\nThe terror is understandable. Though he got good reviews recently in the part in London, he does have big shoes to fill, as have the dozens of other actors who've played the part through the years. Even after a quarter-century, memories of Spinella standing up to AIDS \u2014 and an unreliable partner, and the arrival of that problematic angel \u2014 remain strong.\n\nAn angel whose entrance \u2014 she comes crashing through the ceiling, demolishing plaster, cracking a refrigerator, and generally wreaking havoc \u2014 is both a staging highlight, and a fraught moment for the tech crew. One actress remembers her wig getting caught in the rigging as she was flying in. And the director came home to a phone message that night from a patron who raved about the moment \"when the angel turned upside down screaming, and her wings fell into the audience, and the stage manager came out. It looked so real,\" he said, \"but I knew you'd rehearsed it.\"\n\nTheater magic. You've got to love it.

How?\n\nAsymmetry is a book whose title tells the tale: It's made up of two disparate stories with no apparent connection, and a third story that just hints at the link between the two. Debut author Lisa Halliday won the prestigious Whiting Award for her work \u2014 and while you may not have heard of her, you probably have heard of Colson Whitehead, Jeffrey Eugenides, Alice McDermott and Jonathan Franzen, all of whom are fellow Whiting winners\n\nWhiting literary director Courtney Hodell says the award focuses on a certain kind of book: \"Risky, adventurous important writing that's happening right now in America.\" Hodell says Asymmetry fits this mold perfectly. Readers may be drawn in by the two main stories, without immediately understanding how they form a novel. The first is a May-December love story set in New York; the second, a tale of displacement and war told by an Iraqi American who's been detained by authorities in London's Heathrow airport.\n\n\"They're not even parallel stories,\" Hodell says. \"They're kind of going off at an angle from each other, these two main story lines. But she delicately and subtly creates these little tremors of meaning between them. But I think the fact that you have to figure out what you think she's saying makes the books stay with you.\"\n\n\"I like to think of the book as more of an impressionist novel,\" says Halliday. She's less concerned with the way her stories connect, and more interested in the book's themes \u2014 which she describes as a series of dichotomies: \"Old versus young, east versus west, power versus those who don't have quite so much power, justice and the unjust.\"\n\nThe book begins when Alice, a young editorial assistant in the publishing business meets Ezra, a famous writer. He sits down next to her as she's trying to read a book. They slip into a romance that is both sweet and complicated. They banter back and forth and share a love of baseball and reading. He helps her out financially. She runs errands for him, and begins to understand what it means to be a writer.\n\n\"I wanted Alice's literary education, her sentimental education to be with someone whose stature was about as big as it could be, so that's how and why we have Ezra. There's also the inherent drama of their age difference, because they do come to feel genuine affection for each other. And when someone is so much older, nature is bound to subtract one of them from the world a lot sooner.\"\n\nHalliday herself had a romance in her 20s with a famous older writer \u2014 Philip Roth. And while she may have drawn on that experience in Asymmetry, she insists Alice and Ezra are works of fiction just like Amar, the Iraqi American economist who is the main character in the second story. En route to see his brother in iraq, Amar is detained at Heathrow airport. The story of his life unfolds as he ponders his past and future. If Halliday's first story seems autobiographical, this one seems quite the opposite.\n\nIn order not to be trapped inside our one personhood, we have to try to imagine what it's like to be other people.\n\nNot so, says the author: \"In fact, in many ways Amar is more like I am than any of the other characters in the book. He's closer in temperament. His consciousness is very similar to my own, his ideas, his opinions. So it just goes to show while the first half may seem to be autobiographical, the second half in many, many ways is closer to Lisa Halliday than the first.\"\n\nOne of the themes Halliday explores in this book is the nature of writing itself. She pushes back against the idea that a writer cannot write about a character of another culture, and in the process, she takes on one of the most politically complicated parts of the world, the Middle East \u2014 a place she has never even visited. Imagining lives and worlds unlike your own, she says, is central to the act of creativity.\n\n\"One lives life and then dies having only been one person and I find that a difficult condition sometimes,\" she says. \"And that's why imagination and invention and empathy seems to me so important. In order not to be trapped inside our one personhood, we have to try to imagine what it's like to be other people.\"\n\nWriting, says Halliday, is a challenge that should be taken on with humility \u2014 and with the understanding that you might get something wrong. But just because a situation is complicated, she says, doesn't mean you should back away from it.", "keywords": ["writer", "lives", "thats", "second", "versus", "author", "shes", "think", "main", "asymmetry", "imagines", "halliday", "debut", "book"], "polarity": 0.09889185977421273, "subjectivity": 0.4239185553009083},

Deirdre got down on her bare knees before him, and he hitched forward in his seat to move the scarred stump within two inches of Deirdre's face. Now she started to cry.\n\nCHRISTIAN LORENTZEN: It's a piece of fiction of rare economy and power.\n\nVITALE: Christian Lorentzen is the book critic for New York Magazine. He says Johnson's fiction is not so much about the psychological development of his characters as it is about the style of his writing.\n\nLORENTZEN: And particularly the emphasis on voice and image over psychology makes him a very poetic writer of prose fiction.\n\nVITALE: Denis Johnson started out as a poet, publishing his first collection of verse in 1969 when he was a 19-year-old undergraduate at the University of Iowa. Twenty-three years later, he told NPR member station KCRW that the writer who most influences fiction was a poet.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)\n\nJOHNSON: Walt Whitman is definitely one of the people that I really admire. I mean, just for the largeness of his heart and the breadth and grandness of his vision. And he seemed to have the language to accommodate that.\n\nVITALE: For most of his 20s, Johnson's own talent for language was stifled by drugs and alcohol, but by his mid-30s, he was clean and sober. In 1992, he published a book of autobiographical sketches about his drug-addled youth. \"Jesus' Son\" was hailed by critics and won a cult following. In 1999, it was adapted into a film. The cast included Michael Shannon playing a 21-year-old junkie with no moral compass.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"JESUS' SON\")\n\nMICHAEL SHANNON: (As Dundun) McInnes isn't feeling too good today.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) Maybe I'll come back later.\n\nSHANNON: (As Dundun) Don't worry. I just shot him.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) You mean you killed him.\n\nSHANNON: (As Dundun) I didn't mean to.\n\nVITALE: Shannon met Dennis Johnson on the set of \"Jesus' Son\" and remained friends with him until the author's death.\n\nSHANNON: He had a deep sensitivity for people, for life. I think like a lot of artists that I admire, he found life somewhat overwhelming. And I remember his courage. You know, when he's writing these things, he's drawing from personal experience.\n\nVITALE: Johnson could also be very funny. In a story called \"Triumph Over The Grave,\" the narrator remembers going to the orthopedist for his bum knee while tripping on LSD.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nJOHNSON: The head of orthopedics approached me. He was either a large, almost gigantic person or a person who only seemed gigantic under the circumstances.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nJOHNSON: He gripped my flesh with his seething monster hands and delivered a lecture while he manipulated my lower leg and fondled the joint in preparation, I felt pretty sure, of eating me.\n\nVITALE: In 1992, Denis Johnson said that one of his models for writing was Joseph Conrad, whose goal was to tell a story without judging the characters.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nJOHNSON: He says what I want you to do is to see. If you can get the light shining out from it, then it doesn't matter how ugly it is on the surface. There's something going on underneath it if we can see it. It's the truth underlying everything, and it is the language that gets at that. I mean, it's the language that illuminates what we're seeing.\n\nVITALE: Denis Johnson's story \"Triumph Over The Grave\" ends with this language. Quote, \"it's plain to you at the time I write this I'm not dead but maybe by the time you read it.\" Johnson died of liver cancer last May at the age of 67.

The new prize announced Wednesday will recognize a work of either fiction or nonfiction translated into English and published in the U.S.\n\nExecutive Director Lisa Lucas described the move, which was approved unanimously by the foundation's board of directors, as a bid to transcend traditional boundaries and broaden the awards' scope for the sake of American readers.\n\n\"We are a nation of immigrants, and we should never stop seeking connection and insight from the myriad cultures that consistently influence and inspire us,\" she said in a statement.\n\n\"We want American readers to deeply value an inclusive, big-picture point of view, and the National Book Award for Translated Literature is part of a commitment to that principle. The addition of this award lends crucial visibility to works that have the power to touch us as American readers in search of broadened perspective.\"\n\nIt also expands a stable of prizes that for more than 20 years has numbered just four: fiction, nonfiction, poetry and young people's literature. The latter was added in 1996.\n\nThat said, as The New York Times points out, this is far from the first time the National Book Awards dabbled in a little \u2014 or a lot \u2014 of variety since their founding in 1950. At various points, the prestigious award has recognized genres as diverse as contemporary affairs, philosophy and religion, westerns, and mysteries \u2014 including separate honors for both paperback and hardcover.\n\nIn fact, the National Book Awards used to recognize excellence in translation for a span of roughly 15 years before cutting off the prize after 1983.\n\nOnly after a short-lived experiment in the 1980s, when the prizes were briefly renamed the \"American Book Awards\" and had the number of categories vastly expanded, did the National Book Awards return in their modern iteration to honor just fiction and nonfiction. Poetry, like young people's literature, was worked back into the fold later.\n\nThe new approach, which looks a little farther beyond the borders of the English-speaking world, comes just a few years after the Man Booker Prize \u2014 the premier literary award given out in the U.K. \u2014 made a big step of its own toward greater inclusion: Since 2014, the Man Booker has been open to authors beyond the Commonwealth, the confines by which it used to be defined.\n\nAs for the new National Book Awards category, the foundation says it's intended to honor both author and translator. The inaugural winner will be announced at a ceremony in New York City on Nov. 14.\n\n\"We now have the opportunity to recognize exceptional books that are written anywhere in the world,\" David Steinberger, chairman of the foundation's board of directors, said in a statement, \"and to encourage new voices and perspectives to become part of our national discourse.\"", "keywords": ["translation", "recognize", "prizes", "prize", "honoring", "add", "national", "translated", "award", "awards", "american", "literature", "works", "book", "category"], "polarity": 0.09233815426997243, "subjectivity": 0.41019283746556473},

Le Guin, Whose Novels Plucked Truth From High Fantasy, Dies At 88\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Robin Marchant/Getty Images Robin Marchant/Getty Images\n\nUpdated at 7:25 p.m. ET\n\nUrsula K. Le Guin, a prolific novelist best known for the Earthsea series and The Left Hand of Darkness, died Monday at the age of 88. Across more than 20 novels and scores of short stories, Le Guin crafted fantastic worlds to grapple with profoundly difficult questions here on Earth, from class divisions to feminist theory.\n\nHer son, Theo Downes-Le Guin, confirmed to NPR that she died at her home in Portland, Ore., where she lived with her husband of more than six decades.\n\n\"She was a peaceful warrior,\" he said Tuesday, \"but for us as family, her legacy as a wife and mother is just as extraordinary.\"\n\nAcross the decades-long span of her career \u2014 from her first short story submission at the age of 11 to her work well into her 80s \u2014 Le Guin stood as a towering figure in science fiction and fantasy. Indeed, she completed a triple crown of the genres' biggest prizes, earning the Hugo, Nebula and Locus awards several times over.\n\nStill, while Le Guin deployed alien planets and impossible societies in her novels, fellow Hugo winner Mary Robinette Kowal told NPR's Petra Mayer that Le Guin's work could not be confined to a simple label found atop bookstore shelves.\n\n\"Throughout her life she embraced new forms of technology; she was constantly pushing boundaries and barriers. That is inspiring to me,\" Kowal said.\n\nA child of anthropologists, Le Guin approached her worlds with the investigative eye of one encountering a culture for the first time.\n\nIn The Left Hand of Darkness, released in 1969, interplanetary visitor Genly Ai struggles to make sense of a world in which gender is fluid \u2014 when it's not altogether absent in the androgynous natives. And in the different societies of The Dispossessed, published in 1974, Le Guin explores the frictions born of vastly different ideologies scraping up against each other.\n\nAnd, as her characters often grappled with new worlds, Le Guin herself blazed a trail rarely trod by female writers before her.\n\n\"She was one of the first really big voices in science fiction and fantasy who was a woman,\" Kowal added. \"And I think she did a lot for science fiction and fantasy \u2014 not just for women and women's roles because of her feminism but also legitimizing us as an art form. There are a lot of people who will read an Ursula Le Guin book and go, 'Well, this isn't science fiction, it's literature.' But of course, it is science fiction. A lot of times, she can be a gateway drug for people.\"\n\nFor evidence of this mainstream respect, a reader need look no further than the lifetime achievement honors bestowed on her at the 2014 National Book Awards \u2014 where she also delivered a fiery defense of the practice of literature as a whole.\n\n\"Hard times are coming,\" she warned, \"when we'll be wanting the voices of writers who can see alternatives to how we live now, can see through our fear-stricken society and its obsessive technologies to other ways of being, and even imagine real grounds for hope. We'll need writers who can remember freedom \u2014 poets, visionaries, realists of a larger reality.\"\n\nYouTube\n\nMany of those writers mourned her death on Tuesday.\n\n\"Her words are always with us. Some of them are written on my soul,\" tweeted Neil Gaiman, who presented that 2014 National Book Award to her. \"I miss her as a glorious funny prickly person, & I miss her as the deepest and smartest of the writers, too.\"\n\nHer words will live beyond her death Monday, ringing still in the worlds she opened in her fiction, poetry and essays.\n\n\"Writing is a kind of way of speaking, and I hear it,\" Le Guin told Weekend Edition in 2015. \"And I think a lot of readers hear it, too.

The Chinese authorities have repeatedly assured us that Gui Minhai is a free man,\" she added. \"We expect our citizens to be released immediately and given the opportunity to meet Swedish diplomatic and medical staff.\"\n\nThe arrest Saturday marks a new twist in a tortuous series of events for Gui \u2014 who, though born in China, had to give up his Chinese citizenship when he was naturalized nearly three decades ago as a Swedish national.\n\nGui was among five publishers at Hong Kong's Causeway Bookstore who disappeared without explanation in 2015. The store had a reputation for selling books about Chinese politics banned on mainland China \u2014 and the booksellers' case elicited outrage from many people in Hong Kong who viewed it as a violation of civil liberties and encroachment on the city's autonomy.\n\nNone of these concerns were assuaged when Gui resurfaced in 2016 in Chinese custody, proclaiming his guilt for a deadly drunk-driving collision more than a decade earlier. The televised confession struck many, including the writers' advocacy organization PEN America, as \"staged.\"\n\nHe was released last October \u2014 though his daughter pointed out that that release didn't come with complete freedom: \"He was put under a police-managed flat and he was under surveillance.\"\n\nAnd she said the situation was only complicated by health problems.\n\n\"When he was released, he had developed a set of neurological symptoms that he didn't have when he was taken into custody in 2015. He had a lot of tests done and he was told that he had ALS,\" which is also known as Lou Gehrig's disease.\n\n\"Because he's a Swedish citizen,\" she continued, \"he wanted medical treatment in Sweden or elsewhere in Europe. So he had arranged with the Swedish Embassy to travel up to Beijing on Saturday by train to see a Swedish doctor who had been flown in to examine him.\"\n\nHer father's arrest \"wasn't anything that anybody expected,\" she added, \"because otherwise he wouldn't have taken that train.\"\n\nAs The New York Times reports, the Chinese foreign ministry has denied knowledge of the incident. \"This is not a matter that falls under the purview of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,\" a spokeswoman said, according to the paper. \"I don't understand this specific matter.\"\n\nThis response has not satisfied international critics, including Summer Lopez of PEN America, who condemned the incident in a statement.\n\n\"China's treatment of publisher Gui Minhai \u2014 a story of abduction, detention, and now denial of medical care \u2014 demonstrates flagrant disregard for the rule of law and human rights,\" she said.\n\nNPR's Liana Simonds contributed to this report.", "keywords": ["releasing", "publisher", "books", "months", "china", "released", "medical", "banned", "gui", "chinese", "treatment", "train", "foreign", "seizes", "swedish"], "polarity": 0.034090909090909095, "subjectivity": 0.2573355506282336},

Iranian-American poet Kaveh Akbar has created an online space that lets you do that without leaving your bed.\n\nAkbar runs DiveDapper, which focuses on interviews with major voices in contemporary poetry. It's packed with profiles of writers like Morgan Parker, Ocean Vuong, Wendy Xu, and Max Ritvo \u2014 to name just a few. Every other Monday, he posts a new interview transcript.\n\nThe site grew out of Akbar's own life in poetry, and his struggles with addiction. \"The oldest recognizable poem in my book ranges back to when I got sober,\" Akbar says; his debut collection, Calling a Wolf a Wolf, came out this past September. \"I suddenly had 16 hours a day to fill with something new. My entire life up to that point was predicated on the pursuit of this or that narcotic experience. When that was uplifted, I had to find something else.\"\n\nWriting became his path out of that old life. \"I was so hungry to be having conversations about the poetry that was exciting me, so starved for that sort of dialogue\" as he worked towards an MFA and split 60 hours a week between different jobs all while beginning his recovery. \"DiveDapper became a way for me to manufacture those dialogues directly with the sources.\"\n\nWhen Akbar started out, he says, he was worried that if he cold-called someone like the Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Sharon Olds, she'd be rightfully confused. Now, DiveDapper has become the way Akbar approaches great poets \u2014 but what he didn't expect was that the interviews would turn into real, substantial friendships.\n\n\"francine j harris is one of my best friends in the world now, but we met because of DiveDapper, as she started out and still is just one of my favorite poets in the world,\" Akbar says. Or take this snippet of his conversation with Olds:\n\nAkbar: \"... since I was two years old, I've been spoken to with this consciously elevated vernacular. I went through a period of being deeply self-conscious about it because I didn't want people to think I was being showy. And to make matters worse, all I've ever wanted to do is read, not unlike what you're talking about with Shakespeare. And so this is a low-level anxiety at any point in my life when I'm in conversation with anyone. Olds: Right. Now did your being born in Iran have anything to do with [your mother] wanting to help you with SAT vocabulary in English? Akbar: Oh, that's interesting. My mom is American and my dad's Iranian. I basically spent two years in Iran speaking Farsi and kind of being spoken to in English, but when we moved to America we spoke exclusively English in the house because they were dead-set on Americanizing me. Olds: Right. Akbar: I haven't talked to my mom much about it, but that might've been part of it. I think it was mainly to give me an academic advantage. Olds: Sure. If I had thought of that, I might have done it too! That's sweet and probably kind of maddening. But oh my, parents \u2014 we just want so much to do whatever we can.\"\n\nMost of the interviews on DiveDapper really are this earnest and conversational. What's more, they give us readers the chance to get to know Akbar as well as the poets he's talking to. Akbar jokes that if you've read a dozen DiveDapper interviews, you've spent an hour with a dozen different poets \u2014 and you've actually spent 12 hours with him too.\n\nThrough DiveDapper, budding poets like me get further insight not only into the process of these major voices in poetry, but also Akbar's own process.\n\nIndeed, in 2016, when I first heard Akbar reciting poems from his chapbook Portrait of the Alcoholic at a reading in Seattle, I had no idea that he was also working on DiveDapper. Nor did I know that he workshopped poems with high-school students, or that in the time between performing at book tours, readings and teaching, he'd started thinking about things like silence and how to bring it back into his life and poems. Through DiveDapper, budding poets like me get further insight not only into the process of these major voices in poetry, but also Akbar's own process.\n\n\"There are a lot of interviews where I've really gotten into the weeds of my own life,\" Akbar explains. \"A profound and beautiful and strange intimacy now exists between me and the people who have spent time on the site.\"\n\nAnd based on the interviews, here's what I know about Kaveh Akbar: He believes that everyone should be reciting poems as they walk into a coffee shop, as they do the dishes, as they go on with their lives.\n\n\"The fact that poems exist is the load-bearing gratitude upon which I have built my life,\" he explains. \"And what do you do with gratitude when it piles up? You have to push it outwards.\"\n\nTo learn how to live my life in joyous grateful service of poetry \u2014 that's everything.\n\nHe says it's sort of like eating a Snickers bar. \"Not sharing your gratitude is like holding a Snickers bar in your mouth for a week. You'd just get cavities,\" he laughs. \"This is what I want to do with DiveDapper. As far as I'm concerned, poetry is the best thing that exists in the universe.\"\n\n\"These are the people whose words have shaped my psychic algorithm,\" he says of his interviewees. \"Their language has shaped the way I think about the world. They're part of my consciousness at the level of the neuron. To hear how they did it, how they do it, has been immensely useful to me as a practicing poet and as a human being. To learn how to live my life in joyous grateful service of poetry \u2014 that's everything.\"\n\nJeevika Verma is a poet and writer from India.", "keywords": ["thats", "poems", "interviews", "poet", "poetrys", "divedapper", "spent", "biggest", "cheerleader", "poetry", "akbar", "kaveh", "life", "poets"], "polarity": 0.17494588744588743, "subjectivity": 0.44455810551700964},

NPR takes a look at where young people's literature is now and where the new ambassador would like to take it in the coming year.\n\nKELLY MCEVERS, HOST:\n\nAt the Library of Congress today, Gene Luen Yang officially ended his tenure as national ambassador for young people's literature and handed the baton to Jacqueline Woodson. She is the sixth children's book author to hold the position. And for the next two years, she will be encouraging children and teenagers to read and to read more. NPR's Lynn Neary talked to the two writers about the job.\n\nLYNN NEARY, BYLINE: Gene Luen Yang admits that when he became ambassador two years ago, he was a little disappointed. He thought the job would come with a few more perks.\n\nGENE LUEN YANG: Yeah. I thought there would be a crown and maybe, like, a helicopter of some kind, but none of that happened.\n\nNEARY: As she takes on the job, Jacqueline Woodson has no illusions about the perks. But if anything, she has higher expectations.\n\nJACQUELINE WOODSON: My hope is that by that time I'm no longer national ambassador I'll have changed the world.\n\nNEARY: OK. So the national ambassador for young people's literature may not be the most powerful position in the nation's capital, but Yang says it has rewards of a different kind.\n\nYANG: At a very fundamental level, I got to go to all these different places. I got to hear voices. You know, I got to hear the voices of kids.\n\nNEARY: Each ambassador gets to choose his or her own mission. For example, Jon Scieszka, who held the position first, was particularly interested in encouraging young boys to read. Yang, an award-winning graphic novelist, challenged kids to step out of their comfort zones and read about different kinds of people, unfamiliar topics or new types of books.\n\nYANG: The nation is getting more diverse. And that is reflected in the material that draws the kids in. And I mean diversity in every sense of the word, not just cultural diversity, but also diversity of format. You know, I think kids today are more open to more different kinds of stories than kids in the past.\n\nNEARY: Yang is thrilled to be handing over the job to Jacqueline Woodson, winner of numerous awards, including the National Book Award for her memoir, \"Brown Girl Dreaming.\"\n\nWOODSON: I get to decide my own vision in the end about the work I want to do, how I want to do it, what rooms I want to walk into, what people I feel have not had the kind of access that they should have - mainly underserved people, people in rural communities, incarcerated people - and really point my energies in those directions.\n\nNEARY: Woodson says she'd love to get rid of labels like struggling reader or advanced reader and encourage young people to concentrate more on how a book makes them feel or think.\n\nWOODSON: Labeling is not the best way to get young people to deeply engage in reading. I mean, at the end of the day, you take the qualifier away and they're a reader. Childhood, young adulthood is fluid. And it's very easy to get labeled very young and have to carry something through your childhood and into your adulthood that is not necessarily who you are.\n\nNEARY: Woodson has come up with her own mathematical equation to spark conversation about literature.\n\nWOODSON: Reading equals hope times change. So of course it's that play on words, but it's also the fact that we come to books looking for the hope in them. And when we close a book, we're a different person than when we first opened that book. And reading begins a conversation. And my hope is that we can start having these conversations that literature triggers around the country.\n\nNEARY: Woodson sees the job ahead of her as a continuum of the work that her predecessors have started. Looking back on his own tenure, Gene Luen Yang says the national conversation Woodson hopes for is already underway.\n\nYANG: I think that human storytelling is this long conversation about what it means to exist, what it means to live, how to live a good life. And I think being ambassador has just reinforced the importance of that conversation in my mind.\n\nNEARY: Like her predecessors, Jacqueline Woodson will be traveling all over the country to meet with young people. No helicopters or private planes will be involved. Lynn Neary, NPR News, Washington.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF JACK WILKINS' \"RED CLAY\")\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 NPR. All rights reserved.

I feel like especially in the New Year, it's just a real nice way to cleanse your space and make it feel kind of brand new. And I think it's something that most Americans could probably use to do. I know I could. I like buying stuff. For me, it's clothes and squirrel-related tchotchkes, and they accumulate, you know? And sometimes you might have to go through all your clothes or squirrel collection and hold each item and think about, does this really bring me joy? Or am I keeping it out of obligation? Has it already served its purpose? And to just sort of purge all of these things we let build up around us that don't necessarily make us happy anymore.\n\nMeinzer: I think the lifestyle is absurd. It's ridiculous. You know, she cannot have anything on a counter-top. She cannot have any art on walls. If you want anything pretty, you put it inside your closet so when you open your closet you can look at your art. But anything that's out for the world to see is considered clutter. All of this is ridiculous to me and so this book made me very mad, and my husband and I, who love each other very much, fought while we were living this book, and you can hear it in our show.

They've paid off their house, their cars, all of their clothes are second-hand. They only go grocery shopping one day a month, because if you go grocery shopping more you'll be tempted to do some impulse buying, so they do one giant grocery shopping trip a month and then they make a months' worth of frozen meals and they do all sorts of wacky things like that, and I just loved it. And they have three levels of how to live their lifestyle, so even if you're a beginner, if you're not ready to go grocery shopping only one time for the whole month, maybe you can start off by going grocery shopping only once a week.\n\nGreenberg: I feel like Kristen does, sort of, about Marie Kondo, where if you try to live the way they do \u2014 like they are crazy people. Most people who write self-help books are. They're very extreme people. They say shop once a month, and basically you only have fresh food for first week of that month, but they also say you know planning meals helps cut down on impulse purchases, which I did, you know, sort of take to heart and I try to plan meals more so when I go grocery shopping I don't just go nuts. But I do buy vegetables every week.\n\nOn the book they both advise everyone to avoid in the New Year\n\nGreenberg: We both agree on Men are from Mars, Women Are From Venus by John Gray. ... This book, according to Time magazine, is the bestselling non-fiction book of the '90s. So my parents had this book; everyone's parent's had this book. And Kristen and I are both relative newlyweds, and I was super excited to read this book and gain some actual insights on married life. But turns out, we found it to be incredibly sexist and really condescending towards women.\n\nMeinzer: Yeah, I mean, if you're a woman, your job is basically just to validate your man and stop nagging him so much, and not be upset when he doesn't speak to you for weeks or months at a time.\n\nGreenberg: Don't forget \"knight in shining armor,\" a phrase used often in this book. It's basically men have to feel like a knight in shining armor. Otherwise, like, they will leave you.\n\nOn how people should approach self-help books\n\nMeinzer: I think they should listen to our show and hear how our lives are ruined by a lot of these books! Listen to our show and hear what parts of information work for Jolenta or work for me. So if somebody listens to the show and they know from day one, [they're] a Jolenta, they know that America's Cheapest Family Gets You Right on the Money is going to make them want to throw themselves off a bridge ... and when Jolenta is loving some aspect of a book that gives her a chance to look at her throat chakras and then light candles and rub her crystals, and I want to just punch all the crystals, people know, oh, this is a better book for Jolenta and not a good book for Kristen.", "keywords": ["help", "books", "grocery", "jolenta", "feel", "think", "month", "kristen", "know", "shopping", "actually", "book"], "polarity": 0.17564218948547314, "subjectivity": 0.6095855678318367},

I wrote that U is for Undertow was so good, \"it makes me wish there were more than 26 letters at her disposal.\" Now, of course, that line falls flat.\n\nThe Week's Best Stories From NPR Books 'Y Is For Yesterday': Sue Grafton's Penultimate Mystery Series Novel 'Y Is For Yesterday': Sue Grafton's Penultimate Mystery Series Novel Listen \u00b7 6:35 6:35\n\nAs Grafton's fans know, the writer died of cancer on Dec. 28. Her last novel was Y is for Yesterday, which came out last summer. Turns out, there were only 25 letters at her disposal.\n\nIn interviews, Grafton always described hitting upon the strategy of alphabet titles for her novels as a whim. She said she got the idea after reading Edward Gorey's alphabet picture book, The Gashlycrumb Tinies, in which children die in grisly ways (\"B is for Basil assaulted by bears,\" \"G is for George smothered under a rug\" and so on).\n\nBut what started out as a lark became \u2014 if I may say this of a \"mere\" mystery series \u2014 something defiant, noble even. Because a series that projects itself to the end of the alphabet is a race against limitations: the limitations of time and the imagination.\n\nTime ran out on Grafton, but her creative stamina barely flagged. Sure, not every one of her novels was a standout (how could that be when there were so many of them?), but lots of the recent ones, like the aforementioned Y, were terrific and, as the series went on, her plots grew more intricate, increasingly haunted by the past and its crimes.\n\nThroughout the series, Grafton's detective heroine, Kinsey Millhone, maintained her cheeky humor and cherished autonomy. Kinsey lived alone in what we would now call a \"tiny house\" and relied on that one black dress to see her through funerals and parties. She drank rotgut wine and refused to be cowed by patriarchal authority and the parasitic rich.\n\nIn short, Kinsey was a fictional alter ego for every shy woman who hesitated to talk back. Grafton said she counted herself among those shy women.\n\nI reread Kinsey's debut, A is for Alibi, every few years for the detective fiction course I teach. It came out in 1982, a signature moment in hardboiled history. (Sara Paretsky introduced her gal gumshoe, V.I. Warshawski, that very same year.)\n\nThings were pretty bleak before then for women in hardboiled mysteries \u2014 the two available roles were either femme fatale or corpse. But Grafton, Paretsky and other sleuthing sisters like Liza Cody, Eleanor Taylor Bland and pioneer Marcia Muller picked the locks on the doors of what had been mostly a men's club. They tossed out the genre's sexist, racist and nativist clich\u00e9s along with its moldy cast of usual suspects \u2014 chief among them those emasculating femmes fatales.\n\nOnce those female private eyes and police detectives went to work investigating what Raymond Chandler famously called \"a world gone wrong,\" the villains began to look radically different: mostly male and white. And in these feminist mysteries, evil wasn't imported into America from some exotic locale like it was, say, in The Maltese Falcon; rather, it sat squarely on Main Street \u2014 in banks, churches and corporations.\n\nGrafton and that post-'60s generation of mystery writers revolutionized what had become fossilized formula fiction. They helped make the detective novel matter again.\n\nBecause of those quirky alphabet titles and Kinsey's humor, Grafton's novels were sometimes regarded as \"lighter\" than those of her colleagues. They shouldn't be. Those trademark wisecracks of Kinsey's were often wrapped around barbed social commentary. Here's Kinsey in A is for Alibi describing the tedium of her workday, most of it spent:\n\n... checking and cross-checking, filling in blanks, detail work. ... The basic characteristics of any good investigator are a plodding nature and infinite patience. Society has inadvertently been grooming women to this end for years.\n\nThe conclusion of A is for Alibi is deadly serious. It's an ingenious feminist rewriting of one of the most hateful mystery endings of all time: Mickey Spillane's misogynist masterpiece, I, The Jury. I won't spoil the fun; just think Sigmund Freud and womb imagery triumphantly vanquishing the phallic symbol.\n\nI'd like to think there's something fitting in the way Grafton's alphabet series is almost, but not quite, complete. The greatest hardboiled mysteries never conclude with neat solutions, but rather with ambiguity. Grafton planned to call her last novel Z is for Zero; but, like so many of Kinsey's cases, it remains open.", "keywords": ["graftons", "novel", "grafton", "y", "mystery", "appreciation", "novels", "alphabet", "sue", "kinseys", "helped", "series", "transform", "genre"], "polarity": 0.09628205128205128, "subjectivity": 0.46720085470085476},

Revisiting A Fantasy Classic As An Adult\n\nRevisiting our favorite books from adolescence is a tricky thing. These are, after all, novels we bonded with during a very impressionable time in our lives. As with our first romantic loves, we're often not willing or even able to see their faults. Even in hindsight, our judgment is colored \u2014 by nostalgia, by comfort, by the sense that these books are old friends. It's something I kept in mind during a recent re-read of the Belgariad and the Malloreon, two connected series of fantasy novels from the '80s and '90s written by David Eddings and his wife Leigh Eddings (although Leigh only began being credited toward the very end).\n\nRunaway bestsellers in their day, the staggering 12 novels that comprise these series \u2014 five in the Belgariad, five in the Malloreon, plus two whopping standalone novels, a cycle which celebrated the 20th anniversary of its completion in 2017 \u2014 are staples of the genre, the kind of dog-eared paperbacks that remain piled up in used bookstores. As it turned out, my re-read revealed many of the reasons why Eddings' books continue to be cherished by fans \u2014 and why they also pile up on the secondhand shelves, relics of a less enlightened era.\n\nPawn of Prophecy, the first installment of the Belgariad, was published in 1982, and it was an instant sensation. I was ten at the time, and my Uncle Mike, a big fantasy fan, bought me the book. I had already read fantasy staples by J.R.R. Tolkien and Lloyd Alexander by that age, so Pawn of Prophecy was right up my alley. I fell head-over-heels with it. In the book, a farmboy named Garion gradually begins to learn that his Aunt Pol, the cook in the farm's kitchen, is much more than she seems \u2014 and that Garion himself is the heir to an ancient power. Pursued by enemies of his family, he embarks on a quest across new lands as glimmers of his birthright begin to appear. Along the way, he encounters strange adversaries, colorful fellow travelers, and the deepening realization that his destiny is both noble and terrifying.\n\nYou couldn't make a hero's journey more Campbellian if you tried.\n\nYou couldn't make a hero's journey more Campbellian if you tried. Eddings was a struggling, middle-aged author of contemporary adventure when Pawn of Prophecy was published, and by his own admission, he undertook fantasy with a somewhat cynical motive: One day he saw how many printings Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings had gone through, and he figured there must be more commercial potential to the genre than he thought. Accordingly, Pawn of Prophecy \u2014 and the four books that follow in The Belgariad, where Garion becomes Belgarion, a sorcerer and king tasked by fate to duel to the death with an evil god \u2014 ticks off every box that can make modern mainstream fantasy both beloved and formulaic. Like everyone from Luke Skywalker to Harry Potter, Garion is an orphan who must learn to master his own growing power. The maimed god Torak is Garion's insidious nemesis, an archetype cut from the same cloth as Darth Vader and Voldemort. And where Luke had Obi-Wan and Harry had Dumbledore, Garion has Belgarath, a white-bearded and immortal sorcerer who also happens to be his grandfather, dozens of generations removed.\n\nEddings' lack of freshness isn't enough to dent the warmth and camaraderie between his characters, nor the gently biting banter that typifies his dialogue.\n\nSurprisingly, these worn out tropes didn't bother me when I tackled the Belgariad again as a jaded adult. Eddings' lack of freshness isn't enough to dent the warmth and camaraderie between his characters, nor the gently biting banter that typifies his dialogue. I found myself swept along in the author's obvious enthusiasm for his own creations, just as I had been decades ago. Other things, however, troubled me. As a kid, I never noticed the obsolete gender roles Eddings assigned his characters. Aunt Pol \u2014 who also happens to be Polgara the Sorceress, the most feared and powerful woman in the world \u2014 spends an inordinate amount of page-time happily doing domestic chores. Princess Ce'Nedra, Garion's love interest, intrepidly raises an entire army only to leave it in the hands of the men. Certain characters break stereotype, such as Queen Porenn, who has an excellent grasp of policy and tactics \u2014 but it's always made wincingly clear in the text that she's a glaring exception who only knows about military and political matters because she's married to a king who's taught her such things.\n\nTo Eddings, it's more plausible that sorcery can move mountains than it is that women can be portrayed centrally and strongly. Even worse are the series' racial politics.\n\nThe Belgariad is an epic fantasy, and as such, it's set in a world that's roughly medieval in terms of sociopolitics. For far too long, that's been used as an excuse to portray female characters in fantasy novels as secondary, menial, or lacking in agency. But the Belgariad is not a real-world history; it's not beholden to what actual medieval Europe looked like. To Eddings, it's more plausible that sorcery can move mountains than it is that women can be portrayed centrally and strongly. Even worse are the series' racial politics. The kingdoms of the West are the fair-skinned good guys; the kingdoms of the East are populated by villains with slanted eyes, either systematically sinister or congenitally stupid. The Westerners \u2014 even some of the main characters, painted as heroes \u2014 speak regularly of genocide as a final solution to their racial problems. Such ideas are presented so nonchalantly in the books, they never struck me as a kid. As an adult, they're hard to stomach.\n\nThe Malloreon by David Eddings Paperback, 2 v. | purchase close overlay Buy Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How?\n\nThings do not get better in the Malloreon. The sequel series' five books, starting with 1987's unsettlingly titled Guardians of the West, continue on the same course as their predecessors. At one point, Belgarath says, \"At least the other ladies have sense enough to realize that a battlefield is no place for a woman.\" He's talking to Polgara, a 3,000-year-old mage who's already shown herself to be devastatingly effective on the battlefield in the Belgariad. It's never been entirely clear what the extent of Eddings' collaboration with his wife was throughout the series; in an interview in 2003, six years before his death, he said she helped him especially with his female characters. \"When it gets down to interactions between people \u2014 especially men and women \u2014 [Leigh] gets right in there,\" he said of his writing process. \"She knows women. Like most men, I don't understand them!\"\n\nSadly, Eddings also didn't understand how to craft a compelling sequel. When I read the Malloreon as it was published throughout the late '80s and early '90s, I was just happy to get to spend some more time with Garion, Ce'Nedra, Belgarath, Polgara, and all these other people I had grown to adore. Eddings, to his credit, had a real way with breathing life into his sprawling cast of major and minor characters. But the Malloreon is based on the premise that the showdown between Garion and Torak at the end of the Belgariad \u2014 which was touted as the ultimate resolution of a grand, metaphysical conflict between to warring prophecies \u2014 wasn't so ultimate after all. Eddings did it all with an unconvincing wave of his hand, rather than putting forth a remotely believable reason why the entire cycle of events that took place in the Belgariad we being repeated, almost verbatim, in the Malloreon. Way back in 1982, Eddings titled his initial fantasy offering Pawn of Prophecy; by the end of the Malloreon in 1991, that title seemed to mock Eddings' own inability to refresh or deviate from his own formula.\n\nThe Belgariad and the Malloreon were last gasps, in a sense, of a certain kind of fantasy that proudly buried its head in the sand of tradition and stereotype rather than challenging them.\n\nEddings' tenure in Garion's world ended twenty years ago, with the publication of the standalone novel Polgara the Sorceress in 1997. It was preceded by Belgarath the Sorcerer in 1995, and together, these two books filled in the rich backstory of these two characters that was only hinted at throughout the Belgariad and the Malloreon. (I'm not counting The Rivan Codex, an odd volume published in 1998 in which Eddings offered writing advice and detailed the inspiration and process that went into the creation of these series.) Both prequels and afterthoughts, neither Polgara nor Belgarath are essential to the bigger story \u2014 and on re-reading them, I found them hollow, little more than victory laps for Eddings.\n\nI won't say I felt entirely cheated or disillusioned by my revisitation of the Belgariad and the Malloreon. In particular, the initial five books sparkle, enough to offset their backward treatment of gender and race. But Eddings' books came at a time when fantasy literature was transitioning into something more complex and nuanced, thanks to authors like Tad Williams and George R. R. Martin, all of whom began releasing groundbreaking epic-fantasy series in the late '80s through the mid-'90s. The Belgariad and the Malloreon were last gasps, in a sense, of a certain kind of fantasy that proudly buried its head in the sand of tradition and stereotype rather than challenging them. I'm glad I re-read them, as much to reacquaint myself with some childhood friends as to remind myself that the romances of our youth aren't always as rosy as we remember.

How?\n\nIt seems fitting that 2017 has been bookended by two novels about women and power. When the year began, Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale, which depicts a future where women are stripped of all power, began making its way to the top of best-seller lists. As 2017 draws to a close, another dystopian novel has made it onto some prominent top ten lists: Naomi Alderman's The Power. It imagines a world in which women discover they have a weapon that makes them physically threatening to men \u2014 and that weapon changes everything.\n\n\"It's some sort of electrical thing which will both hurt you, like an electric shock, and will also somehow trigger the pain centers in your brain,\" Alderman says. \"So it's the power to cause pain by violence.\"\n\nYoung women develop this power as they enter puberty, and it comes as a surprise. A character named Roxy uses it for the first time as she is fighting for her life:\n\nHe reaches for her with one hand, the knife in the other. She gets ready to kick him or punch him but some instinct tells her a new thing. She grabs his wrist. She twists something quite deep inside her chest, as if she'd always known how to do it. He tries to wriggle out of her grip, but it's too late. She cuppeth the lightning in her hand. She commandeth it to strike.\n\nNo one knows how or why the mysterious power emerged (though there are many theories) and all over the world women begin experimenting with it. They fight their oppressors, whether it be fending off an attacker or protesting against governments that deprive all women of their rights.\n\nAlderman says it was gratifying to imagine these scenarios. \"If I could go and give to women being sex trafficked right now today in some dirty basement, waiting to be raped \u2014 if I could go and give them the power to electrocute people at will, even knowing that this might end badly, I would give it to them.\"\n\nThe new power makes women physically stronger, and it also changes the way they think about themselves. \"If you were able to live your life as if you were able to cause hurt when you needed to, your life would be so different, even if you never ever had to do it,\" Alderman says. \"That makes you less afraid all the time.\"\n\nNot surprisingly, men find this new female power threatening. In his first encounter with it, a journalist named Tunde is humiliated after a young women spurns his advances with a shock of electricity. He thinks of how the woman laughed at him, and worries that if he tells his friends, they would think he was weak.\n\nTunde begins travelling around the world to report on the changes the power brings about. Men are fighting back, and it turns out women can be just as ruthless when it comes to wielding power. At first, Tunde doesn't understand the severity of the situation.\n\n\"He's a really good man trying to make his way in a changing world,\" Alderman says. \"He's a journalist. He's very excited by these new changes; he wants to chronicle what's going on. And what happens to him is that he slowly learns \u2014 it takes him a while \u2014 that he should have been more afraid.\"\n\nAlderman doesn't shy away from depicting women who are abusive and violent. She even imagines a way that women can rape men, using sex as a weapon just as men do. She hopes those scenes help change the way some readers think about rape.\n\n\"If, like me, by the end of [the] book ... you say, 'Oh yes, I see, this is not about somebody taking some sexual pleasure; this is about the ability to humiliate somebody in the most private, revolting, personal way possible,' then I think we've learned something important about what rape is. Rape is not the best way to go about getting sex. Actually, it is the best way to go about feeling powerful if you are a sadist.\"\n\n... in my world, nothing happens to a man that is not happening to a woman in the world we live in today. So if we find my world to be a dystopia, then we are already living in a dystopia.\n\nMaragaret Atwood was Alderman's mentor as she worked on this novel, but Alderman says The Handmaid's Tale,where men are in total control, is a far more frightening scenario than her own creation.\n\n\"People say to me, 'Ah, your novel is a dystopia.' And I say ... 'It's only a dystopia for the men.' And in my world, nothing happens to a man that is not happening to a woman in the world we live in today. So if we find my world to be a dystopia, then we are already living in a dystopia.\"\n\nAlderman says her book starts out as story about men and women, but it ends up being more about the nature of power itself.

So, when I came across the new cookbook Bollywood Kitchen, I feared it might have been written by someone who knew nothing about Indian culture and only a bit about Bollywood, \"curry\" and naan.\n\nLuckily, I was dead wrong. The book was, in fact, made exactly for me \u2014 a second-generation Indian-American who is intimidated by the thought of making Indian food herself. Author Sri Rao says he wrote this book based on his experience growing up in America as a brown kid.\n\n\"I was really telling the story of how I grew up and how these films connected me to a motherland I never knew,\" Rao says.\n\nFull disclosure: Rao is not a chef. He's a screenwriter for American television and has produced and written for Bollywood films, too.

I grew up in suburban Georgia, craving Chik-fil-A and Waffle House. But now, as a 23-year-old living on her own, far away from home, I find myself missing mom's deep-fried pakoras and hot tomato chaaru with rice. I live near an Indian restaurant that serves dishes like chicken tikka masala (which isn't really Indian, by the way). Nevertheless, I find myself walking past it every day, just to catch a whiff of familiar smells and spices.\n\nThe book features recipes from all over India, like rajma, a bean stew from the north, and dosa, a savory crepe from the south, alongside classic American recipes like butternut squash soup and pan-roasted Brussels sprouts. That's a nod to the many second-generation Indian-Americans, myself included, who grew up with both cuisines, dipping our American grilled cheese sandwiches in Indian tamarind chutney.

'So, this isn't really authentically Indian food, right? This is some sort of fusion.' And I've really taken offense to that, because I feel like this is authentic Indian food.\" Authentically Indian-American, that is.\n\nWhile sifting through recipes in this book, I stopped on mixed vegetable kura \u2014 a dish central to my family lore. When my dad came to the U.S. as a teen, his family didn't have a lot of money. \"I came to the United States with only a few coins in my pocket,\" he would exclaim at dinner. Because frozen bags of mixed vegetables are one of the cheapest things you can buy at the grocery store, my dad bought these bags and made mixed vegetable kura to save money and eat healthfully. Today, he makes my siblings and me eat it at least once a year to remind us that our family came from meager means.\n\nMixed vegetable kura has sentimental value, but it's not exactly my favorite dish. So, for my first foray ever into cooking the cuisine of my forebears, I decided to prepare a dish I actually wanted to eat: baingan bharta. This Punjabi eggplant dish is comparable to an Indian baba ghanoush. (And one of my favorites!)\n\nMy apartment was soon filled with smells of warm cumin, ginger and coriander. Afraid I didn't get the recipe right, I hesitantly tasted a bit of the bharta while it was on the stove. To my delight, it tasted just like my mom's cooking. My mom used to make this dish on school nights after coming home from work. She knows I like it, so every time she makes it, she puts a little extra on my dinner plate.\n\nTo complete the experience, I decided to pair my dinner with a movie.

The ones that you are bound to overlook, simply because they don't fit?\n\nThose are the ones I want to find.\n\nNPR's Book Concierge takes a slightly more malleable approach, allowing readers to filter the results into the classic categories of Fantasy or Nonfiction or Young Adult, but also into more interesting and dynamic ones, such as \"Eye-Opening Reads\" or \"It's All Geek to Me\" or \"The Dark Side.\"\n\nWhy can't we have this kind of approach to recommendations year-round, and preferably from more than one source? I'd much rather find stories under the marquee of \"Women in Power\" or \"Mind-Bending Plots\" or \"Incredible Books that Aren't Debuts.\" I'd love the chance to use filters that serve to expand a category instead of narrowing it, breach the boundaries of the familiar and provide something intersectional, liminal, unexpected.\n\nLab Girl by Hope Jahren Hardcover, 290 pages | purchase close overlay Buy Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How?\n\nWith this kind of system, filtering doesn't mean narrowing, so much as cross-referencing, trading one lens \u2014 a static, familiar one \u2014 for something dynamic.\n\nAnd I'm not looking for a guarantee. When readers have strong feelings about a book, it can go both ways \u2014 those that inspire love also inspire hate. But as a writer, I fear the middle ground, the lukewarm. I'm fine with the risk incurred by picking up a book that might go either way, because both ends are passionate \u2014 and as with most great journeys, worth the risk.\n\nTake, for example, three books I recommend to everyone. (They'd be filtered as \"Just Trust Me.\")\n\nScott Hawkins's ambitious and perplexing debut, The Library at Mount Char, sits somewhere on the border of thriller and speculative fiction, morbid and action-packed and existential and utterly resistant to categorization.\n\nHope Jahren's Lab Girl is a memoir I might have never picked up if so many people hadn't recommended it. An in-depth look at focus, mental health and identity, wrapped up in a series of natural science essays, and one of the most impactful books I've read.\n\nMore recently, I fell for All Our Wrong Todays by Elan Mastai, a time-traveling, mind-bending, neurotic romp centered on the idea that the world we're living in is the result of one young man's monumental f\u2014- up.\n\nWhere do these books belong?\n\nNo matter where you shelve them, you're right. And wrong. Such a broad spectrum of stories can go beneath the sturdy umbrellas of Fiction, SF/F, Non-Fiction, Romance, and it's not that I'm longing for more specificity, exactly \u2014 there's a danger to that, too, for the more we categorize, the less we're likely to discover. But I can't help thinking that we are focusing on the wrong kinds of categories, that in feeding everything through the filter of broad genre, we neglect the opportunity to discover things tangential, adjacent, lingering in the liminal space.\n\nI am fortunate enough to be surrounded by a community dedicated to books, filled with those ready to recommend, to press a work into my hands and say, \"Trust me.\" But even I find myself constantly wishing for doors with different labels, twisting rooms with strange and varied shelving. We live in an age of metadata, of SEO, of algorithm. We should be able to think beyond the same old labels.\n\nI remain in constant pursuit of the odd and the indefinable.\n\nAnd I suspect I'm not alone.\n\nVictoria Schwab's most recent book is Our Dark Duet.

She creates characters that readers can identify with, then puts them in scary situations \u2014 and her fans love it.\n\nKnown as the \"queen of suspense,\" Higgins Clark has sold 100 million copies of her books in the U.S. alone, but she didn't publish her first book until she was a widow in her early 40s. When Higgins Clark turns 90 on Christmas Eve, she'll still be turning out two books a year.\n\nAt a recent pre-birthday party hosted by her publishing company, Simon and Schuster, Higgins Clark slowly made her way through the crowd.\n\nElegantly dressed with perfectly coiffed hair and beautifully manicured nails, she supported herself with a cane that looks like it's made of crystal. Michael Korda, her longtime editor, said, \"I always refer to this as 'Mary's magic wand.' \"\n\nThe two have an easy rapport, which was obvious as they sat down to talk in a quiet corner of the room. Higgins Clark said they've worked together since 1974. \"Mary's been counting,\" Korda said. \"I haven't. But that sounds right.\"\n\nAs the two bantered back and forth, Higgins Clark revealed her self-deprecating sense of humor with a story about a run-in with a would-be fan. \"We go to Palm Beach for a couple of weeks in February, and I was walking down North Avenue and a woman came: 'I can't believe I'm seeing you. I can't believe I'm in your presence. I'm awed to think that I am standing next to \u2014 Danielle Steel.' \" Higgins Clark and Korda have a good laugh at the idea that she's been confused with another best-selling author.\n\nAccording to Korda, Higgins Clark usually finishes one novel around this time of year, and that's when they begin plotting the next one. \"I start phoning up Mary and saying, 'How about this? How about that?' And Mary is wonderful because she says, 'Well, if that were it, I could do this, and this would happen and that would happen,' and she begins to fill it in. Or she says, which is very often the case, 'No, that's not going to work for me.' \"\n\nThat is the greatest compliment I can get, when someone will say to me, \"I read your darn book till 4 in the morning.\" I say, \"Then you got your money's worth.\"\n\nBoth agreed that Higgins Clark's popularity is rooted in her ability to keep her readers turning pages compulsively. Higgins Clark said, \"That is the greatest compliment I can get, when someone will say to me, 'I read your darn book till 4 in the morning.' I say, 'Then you got your money's worth.' \"\n\n\"Any novel that doesn't deliver that is lacking in something,\" Korda said. \"And Mary has that \u2014 she has that instinct to a degree which is very, very rare.\"\n\nStorytelling may be instinctive for Mary Higgins Clark, but she's also famous for her work ethic, which she honed as a young girl growing up in the Bronx, a borough of New York City. Her father died suddenly, leaving her mother to raise three children on very little money. Higgins Clark was 15 when she started going in to Manhattan to work as a telephone operator.\n\nWhen her own husband died suddenly, Higgins Clark had five children to support. She took a job writing short radio programs and got up at 5 a.m. every day to work on her own writing.\n\n\"I could work without interruption till quarter of 7 and then get the kids breakfast,\" Higgins said. \"And I was picked up by my carpool at quarter of 8, and the guys said it was indecent to look in the back seat of the car \u2014 I was still half dressed, in curlers and dragging stockings on.\"\n\nInitially, she sold some short stories and a book about George Washington, but it was her first suspense novel, Where are the Children?, that really took off. Simon and Schuster had given her a $3,000 advance on the first book, and they offered a great deal more for the next. Clark remembers the day her agent called with the news.\n\n\"She said, 'Simon and Schuster has offered $1 million for the hardcover, and Dell is offering $500,000 for the paperback.' And she said, 'Think about it.' I said, 'Think about it!? God's sake, call them back!' \"\n\nSome 50 books later, Higgins Clark is still with Simon and Schuster. At her 90th birthday party, the publisher's president, Carolyn Reidy, toasted Higgins Clark as \"the first lady\" of Simon and Schuster, noting that all her books have been best-sellers.\n\nAlafair Burke was among the guests paying homage to Higgins Clark. She co-authors one of the two books Higgins Clark publishes every year. (Their latest is Every Breath You Take.) Burke has been reading Higgins Clark since high school and said she can't believe she's actually working with her now.\n\nThere's no diva in her whatsoever.\n\n\"There's no diva in her whatsoever,\" she said. \"It's equal work. We sit there and she listens to me; I listen to her. She treats me as a peer. It's really incredible.\"\n\nBob Barnett \u2014 the Washington, D.C., lawyer who brokers some of the biggest deals in the book business \u2014 represents Higgins Clark. He said she is publishing royalty, and he sees no end in sight for her writing career. \"When you're 90, and you sign a new two-book deal, that's pretty remarkable,\" he said. \"And I see no possibility that we won't do five, six, seven more two-book deals.\"\n\nBut 90 seems a lot older than 89, Higgins Clark said, and she's not at all sure she wants to make it to 100. She does know one thing: No matter how many years she has left, she plans to spend them writing. After all, she said, it's the only thing she's good at.\n\n\"If the fairy godmothers come to the cradle, the one who might have left me a singing voice was out of town. I can't sew anything. Well, I fed five kids, but I'm no gourmet cook.\"\n\nShe just turned in a book that's due next spring. Pretty soon no doubt, once the celebrations die down, she and Michael Korda will be throwing around ideas for her next release.", "keywords": ["turns", "books", "mary", "suspense", "clark", "90", "author", "simon", "shes", "higgins", "work", "thrills", "korda", "schuster", "book"], "polarity": 0.2340847763347763, "subjectivity": 0.47487147667147656},

Over this Thanksgiving week, Americans will throw out almost 200 million pounds of turkey alone, according to figures from the Natural Resources Defense Council.\n\nBut before you toss that bird, read on. We asked Massimo Bottura, one of the world's best chefs, to help us figure out what to do with our holiday leftovers.\n\nBottura is a rock star in the food world. His restaurant in Modena, Italy, Osteria Francescana, has three Michelin stars. But at this moment, he's in the kitchen of NPR's cafeteria, bent over a compost bin. He's looking for ... ingredients.\n\n\"I found something very interesting \u2014 onion peels and celery,\" Bottura says as he straightens up again. He also plucks out the stems of a bunch of Italian parsley and declares them \"perfectly fresh.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Beck Harlan/NPR Beck Harlan/NPR\n\nBottura is a firm believer that nothing should be wasted in the kitchen. Most Americans aren't so conscientious. A recent NRDC survey in three U.S. cities found that the average American tosses out 2.5 pounds of perfectly edible food each week. At the top of the list: produce and leftovers.\n\n\"The leftover is a big problem if you don't have a vision, if you don't have the knowledge of what you can do,\" Bottura says.\n\nBottura's vision for our Thanksgiving leftovers is a traditional dish from Emilia-Romagna, the region of northern Italy that he calls home. It's a pasta dish served in broth: \"Passatelli!\" he says, letting each syllable roll out slowly on his tongue. It's his daughter's favorite dish, he says.\n\nTo make passatelli, you'll need a turkey carcass, leftover bread, eggs, Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and nutmeg. (The full recipe is below). As for the rest? It depends on what you have on hand. Bottura takes the scraps he found in our compost bin \u2014 celery, parsley, an onion which he chops roughly, skin and all \u2014 and lays them next to the turkey bones on a baking sheet. Then he adds something most of us toss out: the leafy green tops of carrots. He breaks off some of the greens and dips it in olive oil for me to taste: It's very flavorful.\n\n\"People don't realize how many ingredients you can discover if you are curious,\" Bottura says.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Beck Harlan/NPR Beck Harlan/NPR\n\nThe turkey bones and vegetables go in the oven to roast for about 45 minutes at 350 degrees Fahrenheit, though we check on the bones often to make sure they don't burn. (Roasting coaxes more rich flavor out of the bones.) When improvising in the kitchen, Bottura says, it's important to use your nose as a guide. When the aromatic scents from the oven smell just like Thanksgiving dinner, we know the bones are ready to make broth.\n\nWe cover the bones in a big pot with water, add more veggie scraps and a Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese rind that Bottura found in the NPR fridge. (He says it called out to him: \"Use me! Use me! Touch my soul!\") The rind, he says, will be important to creating a savory broth.\n\nWhile the broth heats, we turn to breadcrumbs \u2014 a good way to use up those stale rolls from Thanksgiving. If the bread isn't dry enough, you can toast it in the oven first for about 20 minutes at 250 degrees. Then, grind up the bread in a food processor.\n\nOr do what Bottura did to get an even finer texture: roll over the crumbs with a glass bottle, a trick he learned from his grandmother.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Beck Harlan/NPr Beck Harlan/NPr\n\n\"If my grandmother could see me doing this now in Washington, she would laugh,\" he says as he works.\n\nThe breadcrumbs go into a bowl with eggs, some grated Parmesan and nutmeg.\n\nBottura kneads it all into dough, then squeezes it through a ricer to make thick noodles. (You can also roll the dough by hand into gnocchi-like shapes.) By now, our broth has been simmering for about 40 minutes and is full of flavor, so we plop in the noodles and raise the heat to high. Once it reaches a boil, the pasta is ready.\n\nThe result is delicious, warm, hearty \u2014 perfect for a cold day.\n\n\"Food costs? Nothing. Emotion? A lot,\" Bottura says as we savor his handiwork.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Beck Harlan/NPR Beck Harlan/NPR\n\nThe cost of not eating our leftovers, on the other hand, is big \u2014 for our wallets and for the planet.\n\n\"The average household of four is wasting about $1,800 annually on food that they buy and then never wind up eating,\" says Dana Gunders, senior scientist at NRDC, citing the group's latest figures.\n\nBread Is Gold Extraordinary Meals With Ordinary Ingredients by Massimo Bottura Paperback, 424 pages | purchase close overlay Buy Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How?\n\nAbout This Book Bread Is Gold was born of Refettorio Ambrosiano, a project Bottura started in 2015 in Milan, Italy. It's a soup kitchen, designed to look like a high-end restaurant, serving meals from donated ingredients to the city's neediest residents. He recruited dozens of world-class chefs \u2013 including Gast\u00f3n Acurio, Ferran and Albert Adri\u00e0 and Alice Delcourt \u2014 to cook there; many contributed the recipes they created to the new cookbook. Proceeds from Bread Is Gold go to Bottura's nonprofit, Food For Soul, which is setting up soup kitchens stocked with surplus flood in cities around the world.\n\n\"Households are actually the biggest contributor to the amount of food going to waste across the country \u2014 more than grocery stores or restaurants or any other sector,\" Gunders says. Food is the No. 1 contributor to landfills, and as it decomposes, it releases methane, a powerful greenhouse gas.\n\nBut Gunders says changing our habits at home really can make a difference. That means things like planning before shopping so we don't buy more food than we can use in a week, freezing food before it goes bad \u2014 and learning to love leftovers.\n\nFor Bottura, changing the culture around wasting food has become a passion. His new cookbook, Bread Is Gold: Extraordinary Meals with Ordinary Ingredients, is full of recipes and tips for home chefs to improvise with whatever is in the fridge. His goal is to create more confidence in home kitchens. \"This is not a charity project,\" he says. \"It's a cultural project.\"\n\n\"You're going to spend less, you're going to have better food, you're going to save money and fight waste,\" he says. \"Because it's about you, your creativity.\" All proceeds from the book go to Food for Soul, Bottura's nonprofit that is setting up soup kitchens stocked with surplus flood in cities around the world.\n\n\"This is a mission,\" Bottura says. \"You know, cooking is an act of love. And so if you can transfer that to people, you can change the world.\"\n\nChanging the world ... one leftover meal at a time.\n\nMassimo Bottura's Passatelli in Turkey Broth\n\nEditor's note: This is the recipe Bottura improvised in NPR's kitchen. It's based on a recipe handed down from his grandmother, which we've also included below.\n\nFor Passatelli:\n\n10 ounces dried breadcrumbs\n\n\u00be cup plus 2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese\n\n3 eggs\n\n\u00bc teaspoon salt\n\n\u00bd teaspoon ground pepper (either black or white is fine)\n\nGrated nutmeg to taste**\n\nTo make the breadcrumbs, you can run stale bread through a food processor. Make sure the breadcrumbs are dry \u2014 you'll want them to be almost powdery when ground up. If your crumbs aren't dry, toast them in the oven at 250 degrees Fahrenheit for about 20 minutes (but don't let them burn).\n\nIn a medium bowl, mix together the breadcrumbs, Parmigiano and nutmeg. Mix in the salt, pepper and eggs. Bottura's advice: Start by adding one egg at a time so that you don't end up with dough that's too watery. Bottura started by adding 1 whole egg plus one yolk (because he loves the taste), then added another egg after finding the dough was still too dry. You don't want dough to be too mushy or too dry \u2014 just wet enough that it holds together.\n\nGather the dough into a ball, cover with plastic wrap and set it aside for 20 minutes. When it's done resting, push the dough through a ricer and drop the noodles into the turkey broth (once it is ready). (Note: If you don't have a ricer, you can roll the dough by hand instead but may need to use more eggs to create a more malleable dough.)\n\nFor turkey broth:\n\nTurkey bones\n\nOnions\n\nCarrots\n\nParsley\n\nCelery\n\nParmigiano-Reggiano rind\n\nLay the turkey bones out on a baking sheet or pan with an edge. Add the onions, chopped roughly, skin and all, green carrot tops, parsley. (The vegetables enhance the flavor of the bones.) Roast in the oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for about 45 minutes, checking the bones every 10 minutes or so to make sure they don't burn, as that will alter the flavor of the broth. After about 20 minutes, use tongs to turn over the bones to ensure even roasting.\n\nWhen roasted, put the bones in a pot and cover them with cold water. Add fresh onions (no peels this time), more carrots and celery (not the vegetables you just roasted). Bottura added the Parmigiano-Reggiano rind he found in the NPR fridge for added flavor.\n\nLet the broth simmer on medium-low heat for at least 40 minutes (an hour or more is ideal). Once it tastes right (nice and meaty), drop the passatelli into the broth and raise the heat to high. When the passatelli surfaces (about 1 minute), it's ready. (Over-boiling will result in mushy pasta.)\n\nServe passatelli in broth, topped with Parmesan cheese.\n\nNonna Ancella's Passatelli\n\nCourtesy of Massimo Bottura and his wife, Lara Gilmore\n\nBreadcrumbs are the epitome of the \"waste not, want not\" food ethic. If there is an important lesson we have learned from the Italian kitchen, and one that we can pass on to future generations: Never let edible food go to waste! We share this message in the shape of my grandmother Ancella's recipe for passatelli in broth.\n\nThis classic Emilian recipe, passatelli in broth, has been passed on from generation to generation in the Bottura family. Our daughter, Alexa, learned to make passatelli from her grandmother Luisa. Massimo learned how to make them from his grandmother Ancella. It is a rite of passage in many Modenese households. The recipe is so easy and child-friendly, we encourage teaching the whole family to get their hands messy and cook with their parents.\n\nFor the broth, a classic vegetable or chicken broth is best. However, in an emergency, Massimo often prepares a Parmigiano-Reggiano rind broth. He keeps all the rinds from grated cheese in the refrigerator until he has a good amount \u2014 say \u00bd pound. The cheese rinds can be added to a big pot of cold water and simmered for a couple of hours. As the rinds melt, they give off flavor and thicken the broth with the proteins and fats from the cheese. This broth is very simple but can be great to have in a pinch. Of course, the cheese rinds can also be added to classical broths to enrich the flavor as well.\n\nIngredients:\n\n1 \u00bd cup (150 grams) breadcrumbs\n\n1 cup (100 grams) grated Parmigiano-Reggiano\n\n3 eggs\n\npinch of ground nutmeg\n\n34 ounces (1 liter) of chicken broth\n\n1 teaspoon of lemon zest\n\nKitchen tools:\n\npotato ricer with large holes\n\nlarge pot for broth\n\nladle\n\nPlace the breadcrumbs, Parmigiano-Reggiano, nutmeg and lemon zest in a shallow bowl. In the meantime, bring broth to a low simmer. Break the eggs and add to the dry ingredients. Mix together into a uniform ball of dough. Place the dough in a ricer and press it directly into the boiling broth. Cook the passatelli until they surface, about 1 minute. Serve hot with broth in a bowl.", "keywords": ["beck", "chef", "taste", "passatelli", "broth", "dont", "master", "turkey", "thanksgiving", "leftovers", "bottura", "food", "dough", "waste", "minutes", "reimagines", "bones"], "polarity": 0.15985386041815902, "subjectivity": 0.49233901190735724},

Today, when people can read on their phones, some books never even make it to paper.\n\nOnce, bookmaking was an art as refined and distinct as the writing it presents. And in some places, like Larkspur Press in Kentucky, it still is.\n\nFor more than 40 years Gray Zeitz has been creating books one at a time in his two-story print shop near the town of Monterey. He works with the some of the state's finest writers, including Wendell Berry and Bobby Ann Mason, and his Larkspur Press turns out just a few editions a year.\n\n\"I have had, and still do have, printers that come in that used to work on presses like this and they are just tickled to death,\" says Zeitz, 69, showing me his 1915 Chandler & Price printing press. He cuts stacks of paper on another machine that dates from the late 1800s.\n\nZeitz left the University of Kentucky in the winter of 1974, half a semester away from finishing an English degree. He'd been learning letterpress work \u2013 the way individually set type makes an impression on high-quality paper \u2013- and he wanted to make fine books, especially poetry. At that time, the letterpress craft was fading as printers moved to faster offset printing.\n\nBut to Zeitz the moment seemed right. He didn't need electricity at first, or indoor plumbing. He'd grow tobacco to sell and they'd raise calves. Kentucky writers would be featured.\n\nLater, to pay the bills, he added in smaller print jobs. \"There was a point when my wife, Jean, came up to me and said, 'Gray, you're either going to have to start doing some of these jobs \u2014 job printing \u2014 or you're going to have to go out and get a job.\"\n\nHe began taking orders for things like business cards and wedding announcements. \"That became interesting to me as well.\"\n\nIn those days, Monterey was attracting hippies and musicians and artists and candlemakers. Early on they started a fall festival at Larkspur, and people come from all over the country to see the books Zeitz creates \u2014 to touch and feel their hand-sewn bindings and see the perfection Larkspur strives for in the pages.\n\n\"This whole concept of texture and lightness, there's a kind of sensual quality just to the book itself,\" says his friend Jack Campbell, who works in industrial design.\n\ntoggle caption Noah Adams/NPR\n\nGabrielle Fox is a professional bookbinder who's done lots of high-end work for Larkspur.

How?\n\nIt's the stories and people behind those aprons that have delighted EllynAnne Geisel for years.\n\nGeisel wrote The Apron Book in 2006, after many years as a successful, full-time homemaker. The book, an update of which has just been reissued, is a celebration of aprons \u2014 their many patterns and uses, and stories from enthusiasts about the roles aprons have played in their lives. But early in her life, Geisel says she didn't have much experience cooking and was worried about her abilities.\n\nThe day of her wedding, she says her husband's aunt \"gave me the 1975 edition of The New York Times Cookbook with a tucked in note that suggested if I could read, I could cook, and she had faith I could read. She was right, and 42 years later, her note still carries much wisdom.\"\n\nWhen her children left the home, she says she decided she wanted to try a new job as a writer. Her first subject would be the apron \"as the icon symbolic of my homemaking years.\"\n\nAdding to those she already had, Geisel started to collect aprons of all kinds, taking time to notice the different patterns, fabrics, designs, accents and most importantly, the stories behind each one.\n\n\"Using the apron as inspiration, I felt a connection to the women of earlier generations who'd tied one on ... as daily domestic armor,\" Geisel wrote. \"I began to collect their aprons, their household linens, their kitchen utilities, their cookbooks and recipe boxes.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of David Foxhoven Courtesy of David Foxhoven\n\nAfter she started writing about aprons and their history, Geisel says she received a letter sent with a \"black checkered chef style apron.\"\n\n\"The writer was the niece of a housekeeper, who had worked for a famous cookbook author for many years. One of her duties was to maintain his aprons, which were serviced by a dry cleaner. Upon his death, she was allowed one item as a remembrance. She took an apron, which the niece eventually acquired. The apron, she wrote to me, was meant to be mine, for she didn't cook and better than to toss it, she was giving it to me. There's a dry cleaner's twill label sewn to one of the apron's ties, a name stamped upon the twill.\"\n\nThe apron's owner was none other than Craig Claiborne, the author of that New York Times Cookbook that had gotten Geisel started in the kitchen.\n\nGeisel still gets aprons in the mail. They come from all over with notes about whom the original owners were and what time period they were used. But as much as Geisel is overjoyed when she gets a new apron, she is also exuberant when she can give one away.\n\nShe realized this 12 years ago around Thanksgiving time, when she wrapped a baked good into the apron along with a note and gave it to her neighbor who was dealing with a hardship.\n\nAfter she saw the joy it brought her neighbor, Geisel started Tie One On Day on the day before Thanksgiving. She says it's a way for people to continue to pass on the kindness to their neighbors through aprons, baked goods and heartfelt notes.\n\nBut even when it's not Tie One On Day, Geisel is spreading her love of aprons. Her collection has grown so large that she is able to rotate aprons in and out of her traveling exhibit, \"The Apron Chronicles.\"\n\nShe also gives out aprons to the women in her life and to strangers she meets, or sometimes doesn't meet. Geisel attaches notes in which she tries to give some of the apron's history to its new owners.\n\n\"I relate aprons and voices,\" Geisel says. \"I think the women's voices are woven into the fabric, and it's their spirit when you tie it on \u2014 you bring them back.

I picked it up from the bookstore of a church I was invited to in my late teens. This \"expanded\" version featured maps, reading plans, and questionnaires geared toward teenagers who wanted to learn how to effectively apply biblical principles to their daily lives. In other words, how to learn to be the \"salt of the earth.\"\n\nThe Gospels by Manuscripts Paperback, Box Set | purchase close overlay Buy Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How?\n\nWhile the environment was certainly foreign to me at the time, what kept me coming back to the youth group were the words: The scriptures, with their psalms and lyrical exhortations, tugged at a wayward misfit who had an affinity for poetry and vivid prose. Since then, I've owned dozens of Bibles in various translations and languages.\n\nYou don't have to look hard to notice the Bible has been marketed to fit nearly every person and interest. There are editions dedicated specifically for men, women, toddlers, athletes, military wives, and people in Twelve-Step recovery programs \u2014 each edition emphasizing relevant passages and often featuring commentary from religious scholars or well-known personalities. Sometimes they're a bit much \u2014 the Patriot's Bible, for one, is a damn shame that wears its racism and twisted view of patriotism on its proverbial sleeves \u2014 but other times they succeed in helping bring the text to life.\n\nBut they all have something in common: Nearly every Bible I've ever come across, with a few exceptions \u2014 the ESV Reader's Bible, for example, which presents scripture as one extended storyline \u2014 has functioned as a kind of reference book. The numbered-verse structure, a relatively recent convention, has had its fair share of critics for centuries: Ancient manuscripts didn't contain these divisions that have become so familiar to modern readers. But there's also been a surge of interest in engaging with the Bible in the same way you would a novel, free of footnotes and asides.\n\nThat's the approach taken by the small team behind Manuscripts, a new version of the Bible in the form of individual pocket-sized volumes \u2013 the first of which are coming out this month after a successful crowdfunding campaign.\n\n\"Our research showed us that people were often intimidated by how it's traditionally been presented; as one big book,\" says Manuscripts creative director Jacob Scowden. \"We wanted to give an ease to it, and reemphasize the effectiveness of reading the Bible as individual books.\"\n\nManuscripts is beginning with the Gospels \u2014 Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John \u2014 a spiritual biography of sorts chronicling Jesus's life, teachings, and ministry. In their version, each section of text is arranged in a single column, devoid of verse numbers and footnotes, so it reads less like a textbook.\n\nWhile having passages broken down into manageable chunks can prove useful in certain contexts, it can also make it harder to figure out the author's original intent. (And though the Bible's authorship, and authorial intent for that matter, brings its own set of questions, it's still an argument worth noting.) But who still reads the Bible, anyway? And who might benefit from something like what Manuscripts offers? A 2017 survey by the Christian research firm (and bookstore chain) LifeWay showed that 1 in 5 Americans have read the entire Bible at least once, with 9 percent claiming to have read it through multiple times.\n\nAlthough the content remains familiar and unchanged, it feels, somewhat surprisingly, like I've discovered something new.\n\nAs I skim through the pages of the Manuscripts book of Luke, I can't help but wonder if those numbers would climb considerably, just on the basis of its simplicity. It's easy to read and functions, to my mind, like a piece of literature. Plus, it's much easier to engage with than that first Bible I got from the church bookstore all those years ago.\n\nJon Hernandez, a friend and executive minister at Concord First Assembly in North Carolina, tells me Manuscripts could be a useful tool to help expand the Bible's readership, especially among millennials. \"For a generation consuming information in 140 characters or less, anything that can make the scriptures more approachable is welcomed.\" He has a point.\n\nAs someone who has read the Bible for years and yet always found its presentation daunting, this is something I didn't know I wanted. Something I can breeze through in minutes and yet still feel enriched by the text. Although the content remains familiar and unchanged, it feels, somewhat surprisingly, like I've discovered something new.\n\nJuan Vidal is a writer and critic for NPR Books.

She learned a lot about the American criminal justice system. She knew all the grim statistics. But she was still searching for the inspiration for a novel she'd hope to write: one that involved an individual's encounter with the system, and the subsequent ripples that touch that person's community.\n\nThen, while she was in Atlanta visiting her mother, she found what she needed during a routine trip to the shopping mall.\n\n\"I overheard a couple arguing,\" she remembers. \"The woman was beautifully dressed, cashmere coat, the whole nine.\"\n\nThe young man having the heated discussion? Jones says, \"He looked fine, but she looked great. And she said to him 'Roy, you know you wouldn't have waited on me for seven years.' And he said 'I don't know what you're talking about; this wouldn't have happened to you in the first place!\"\n\nAnd right there, something clicked; Tayari Jones found what she needed, and began work on An American Marriage.\n\nIt's a story of love and loyalty and race and justice and what happens when the unthinkable happens to \"normal\" people. Roy and Celestial Hamilton are those people \u2014 a young African-American golden couple who met on the campus of their historically black college. They marry soon after graduation and seem poised for success: he's a rising corporate executive, she's a promising artist. Then, on a visit to his parents in tiny Eloe, Louisiana, Roy is falsely accused of a terrible crime.\n\nTayari Jones says Roy's struggle against his fate reminds her of a contemporary version of an ancient story.\n\n\"This book in many ways, was inspired by the Odyssey,\" Jones says. \"Roy is like Odysseus \u2014 he has this huge challenge and he has to travel this journey ... and he just wants to find a clean home and a faithful wife waiting on him at the other end.\"\n\nBut Celestial is no Penelope; she is a modern woman who can't just sit and wait for her man. She has a business to run (she makes one-of-a kind dolls, the kind museums collect...) and she needs to figure out what's going to happen for the rest of her life. No one knows how long Roy will be behind bars, or whether he will ever be exonerated.\n\nRoy's incarceration has an effect far beyond him and Celestial. Both sets of parents are heavily invested in his defense \u2014 and in the preservation of their children's marriage. In creating her storyline, Jones wanted people to understand that for black Americans, \"Injustice in the criminal justice system \u2014 it's just in the air. Like hurricanes if you live on the East Coast or earthquakes if you live out West. It's just something that is.\" The possibility of being snapped up into the system is always there, hovering.\n\nEven if you've never gotten so much as a traffic ticket. One mistaken identification, one careless follow-up, and like Roy, you can become part of the country's prison-industrial complex.\n\nBut Jones wanted Roy to be more than a symbol of black male vulnerability. \"When you're in love, love is not about symbolism, it's about individuals,\" she insists.\n\nRoy and Celestial try to remain connected via a series of letters, communication that turns out to be increasingly hard to maintain over time. (Jones herself is a prolific letter writer, so she drew on that skill for the couple's correspondence.) It gets even harder as their best friend, Andre, becomes both cherished support and emotional complication.\n\nJones says she hopes readers of An American Marriage don't divide themselves into Team Roy, Team Celestial, Team Andre. It's not about picking sides.\n\n\"I really hope people who read this book will find themselves unsure of which character they identify with the most,\" she says. \"I just want readers to walk away thinking, 'This situation is more complicated than I thought.'\"", "keywords": ["roy", "criminal", "love", "system", "jones", "justice", "american", "marriage", "redefining", "team", "celestial"], "polarity": 0.0875667951839827, "subjectivity": 0.46878720238095234},

A long list of authors and artists were honored for works of fiction and nonfiction for kids and young adults. The awards that always draw the most excitement and attention are the Caldecott and Newbery medals, as NPR's Lynn Neary reports.\n\nLYNN NEARY, BYLINE: A gathering of true believers was on hand today to hear the announcement of the awards at the ALA's annual midwinter meeting. Loud cheers rang out as crowd favorites were honored for a range of awards from best newcomer to lifetime achievement. Nina Lindsay, who emceed the event, says some librarians had a lot invested in the winners.\n\nNINA LINDSAY: Sometimes there are controversial titles or underdogs that people have been championing for a long time. So sometimes when you hear the loudest yell in the room, it's the person who feels really vindicated that they've been talking this book up all year long and now it has a sticker on it.\n\nNEARY: That sticker on the front cover of a winning book carries a lot of weight. It can bring with it new respect, and hopefully more sales. It can literally change the course of a career. Erin Entrada Kelly was on the road this morning when she got a message from her editor asking where she was.\n\nERIN ENTRADA KELLY: And I said, I'm in my car. Where am I supposed to be? She said, someone's about to call you. Pick up the phone. So I was on 95, and I started screaming and immediately turned around and came back home.\n\nNEARY: That's how Kelly learned that she had won the Newbery Medal for the most outstanding contribution to children's literature for her book, \"Hello, Universe.\" The Newbery judges said it is a story where Filipino folklore and real life converge. Kelly says the story reflects some of what she herself experienced as a young girl.\n\nKELLY: You know, when I grew up, I was the only Filipino in my school. And it was - you know, I felt very much like an outsider. So that's something that's also really important to me is to write books that celebrate the underdog, that celebrate characters who might be underestimated or who might be - feel like they're alone in the world.\n\nNEARY: Kelly says she's still stunned by the award.\n\nKELLY: It's incredibly overwhelming to know that that little girl that I was, you know, when I was 9 or 10, writing books and feeling like that little alone girl, now has been bestowed, you know, the highest honor in children's literature that you can possibly receive. I mean, it's really hard to put into words what that means for me.\n\nMATTHEW CORDELL: I was speechless. Like, I - for the first time in my life that I can think of I had no words. I couldn't put together a sentence.\n\nNEARY: Matthew Cordell was honored with a Caldecott medal for best picture book for \"Wolf In The Snow.\" It's a story that turns the Little Red Riding Hood tale on its head, though Cordell says that wasn't intentional. It began as a single image.\n\nCORDELL: The picture was a girl in a red coat, and she was standing in a snowy field. And she's looking across that field, very - not too far from her - standing a - an adult wolf.\n\nNEARY: \"Wolf In The Snow\" is what's known as a wordless book because there's no text. The pictures tell the whole story.\n\nCORDELL: Of all the books and stories I've created, this was one I felt like didn't need the text. The text was really just kind of getting in the way. Yeah, so this was my first crack at a wordless book. But now I've sort of got the bug, so I'm working on another wordless book right now.\n\nNEARY: After catching their breath, both Cordell and Kelly hope to celebrate. Though Kelly says first, she plans to clean her house. Lynn Neary, NPR News, Washington.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF NOBODY'S \"WAKE UP AND SMELL THE MILLENIUM\")\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.

I spent more time with Kayak than anyone else over the past 10 years. He was my best friend and closest companion. He was my stability. ... Soon after I left Oregon for our last move together, I found out that his kidneys were failing and he passed soon after, in my arms.

A winged angel flew in at the end of the first half, and that was after the action had leapt from Manhattan to Salt Lake City to Antarctica.\n\nImagine the actors' reactions at that first read-through. Actually, you don't have to imagine because in their oral history The World Only Spins Forward, authors Isaac Butler and Dan Kois got them to talk about it.\n\nActress Lori Holt, for instance, who played the Valium-popping wife of a gay Republican Mormon in one of the earliest Angels workshops at San Francisco's Eureka Theater Company, read her journal entries to the authors.\n\n\"I wrote in my journal, December of '88: 'The script is outrageously long, the first part alone is 200 pages plus.'\"\n\nTwo hundred pages-plus of laughter, fury, anguish, poetry, drag queens, closeted lawyers, Mormons, and \u2014 especially \u2014 politics. And that was just the first half. Today, the plays are a known quantity, having won a Pulitzer Prize, inspired a multi-part HBO adaptation, and having been produced, published, and taught the world over for 25 years. But in the early 1990s, there was a very real question as to whether an audience would even get it. No one knew for sure. Including, the authors discovered, the playwright.\n\n\"Opening night, which is critics night,\" Kushner told them, \"is like performing at a stenographer's convention. Nobody laughs. It's horrible. And then they all go home and write their reviews, and the reviews come out.\"\n\nOpening night, which is critics night, is like performing at a stenographer's convention. Nobody laughs. It's horrible.\n\nHe's talking here about the first London production, before there was any talk about bringing Angels to New York. He and director Declan Donnellan had disagreed strenuously about the staging. Emotions were running high, and the director told the cast he didn't want anyone to read the reviews. They were all going to meet up at a bar \u2014 and actors being actors, one went to a newsstand on the way to the bar and arrived with an armload of newspapers. Once they'd been plunked on a table, Donnelan forgot all about his instructions and started reading them aloud, sight unseen.\n\n\"Tony was sort of shriveling on the other side of the table,\" Donnellan recalls. \"And I read all these reviews, and they were all total raves. And then I realized what an awful, risky thing I'd done.\" '\n\nThe book weaves together this sort of in-the-moment remembrance with the reactions of everyone from critics, to gay former Rep. Barney Frank. Its oral history consists of a sort of tapestry of snippets from almost 250 interviews, arranged in chapters that deal with the show's development, its casting, its reception, and its legacy. The point is not just to show how this play found its voice, but also to place it in context. Angels was a product of, and was dramatizing, a moment when the purple splotch of Kaposi's Sarcoma \u2014 evidence of a compromised immune system \u2014 amounted to a death sentence.\n\nOne of the play's more telling scenes finds Prior and Lewis \u2014 the central gay couple played by Stephen Spinella and Joe Mantello in the original Broadway production \u2014 coming to terms with that fact. Prior shows Lewis a splotch on his arm, and Lewis responds, \"That is just a burst blood vessel.\"\n\n\"Not according to the best medical authorities,\" demurs Prior as Lewis dissolves in sobs. \"K.S. baby. Lesion number 1, the wine dark kiss of the angel of death, I'm a lesionaire, the foreign lesion. The American lesion. Lesionaire's disease. My troubles are lesion ... Don't you think I'm handling this well? I'm going to die.\"\n\nMantello, now celebrated as the director of the smash musical Wicked, is devastated (and devastating) in that scene, which more or less introduced him to audiences. He was, he tells the authors, so unskilled at auditioning that he was \"virtually unhireable\" before Angels opened on Broadway in 1993.\n\n\"It wasn't like a natural progression,\" he says, \"of somebody who had been working a lot off-Broadway. It was really: very few acting jobs ... Angels in America.\"\n\nToday, the play attracts much bigger names. Celebrated Broadway headliner Nathan Lane will play closeted lawyer/moral monster Roy Cohn in the 25th anniversary Broadway revival, and movie star Andrew Garfield, who not long ago was Hollywood's amazing Spider-Man, will wear \"the wine-dark kiss of the angel of death.\" The book's authors asked Garfield to comment on how his own sexuality affects playing a now-iconic gay character\n\n\"I, as far as I know, am a heterosexual male in a heterosexual male's body. And I'm not confused about that. And of course, the responsibility of taking on this role in a seminal play \u2014 a seminal gay play \u2014 filled me with joy. Because I knew deep down it was going to be fine. But just above that deep down was a layer of terror, of: 'I'm the wrong person for this.'\"\n\nThe terror is understandable. Though he got good reviews recently in the part in London, he does have big shoes to fill, as have the dozens of other actors who've played the part through the years. Even after a quarter-century, memories of Spinella standing up to AIDS \u2014 and an unreliable partner, and the arrival of that problematic angel \u2014 remain strong.\n\nAn angel whose entrance \u2014 she comes crashing through the ceiling, demolishing plaster, cracking a refrigerator, and generally wreaking havoc \u2014 is both a staging highlight, and a fraught moment for the tech crew. One actress remembers her wig getting caught in the rigging as she was flying in. And the director came home to a phone message that night from a patron who raved about the moment \"when the angel turned upside down screaming, and her wings fell into the audience, and the stage manager came out. It looked so real,\" he said, \"but I knew you'd rehearsed it.\"\n\nTheater magic. You've got to love it.

How?\n\nAsymmetry is a book whose title tells the tale: It's made up of two disparate stories with no apparent connection, and a third story that just hints at the link between the two. Debut author Lisa Halliday won the prestigious Whiting Award for her work \u2014 and while you may not have heard of her, you probably have heard of Colson Whitehead, Jeffrey Eugenides, Alice McDermott and Jonathan Franzen, all of whom are fellow Whiting winners\n\nWhiting literary director Courtney Hodell says the award focuses on a certain kind of book: \"Risky, adventurous important writing that's happening right now in America.\" Hodell says Asymmetry fits this mold perfectly. Readers may be drawn in by the two main stories, without immediately understanding how they form a novel. The first is a May-December love story set in New York; the second, a tale of displacement and war told by an Iraqi American who's been detained by authorities in London's Heathrow airport.\n\n\"They're not even parallel stories,\" Hodell says. \"They're kind of going off at an angle from each other, these two main story lines. But she delicately and subtly creates these little tremors of meaning between them. But I think the fact that you have to figure out what you think she's saying makes the books stay with you.\"\n\n\"I like to think of the book as more of an impressionist novel,\" says Halliday. She's less concerned with the way her stories connect, and more interested in the book's themes \u2014 which she describes as a series of dichotomies: \"Old versus young, east versus west, power versus those who don't have quite so much power, justice and the unjust.\"\n\nThe book begins when Alice, a young editorial assistant in the publishing business meets Ezra, a famous writer. He sits down next to her as she's trying to read a book. They slip into a romance that is both sweet and complicated. They banter back and forth and share a love of baseball and reading. He helps her out financially. She runs errands for him, and begins to understand what it means to be a writer.\n\n\"I wanted Alice's literary education, her sentimental education to be with someone whose stature was about as big as it could be, so that's how and why we have Ezra. There's also the inherent drama of their age difference, because they do come to feel genuine affection for each other. And when someone is so much older, nature is bound to subtract one of them from the world a lot sooner.\"\n\nHalliday herself had a romance in her 20s with a famous older writer \u2014 Philip Roth. And while she may have drawn on that experience in Asymmetry, she insists Alice and Ezra are works of fiction just like Amar, the Iraqi American economist who is the main character in the second story. En route to see his brother in iraq, Amar is detained at Heathrow airport. The story of his life unfolds as he ponders his past and future. If Halliday's first story seems autobiographical, this one seems quite the opposite.\n\nIn order not to be trapped inside our one personhood, we have to try to imagine what it's like to be other people.\n\nNot so, says the author: \"In fact, in many ways Amar is more like I am than any of the other characters in the book. He's closer in temperament. His consciousness is very similar to my own, his ideas, his opinions. So it just goes to show while the first half may seem to be autobiographical, the second half in many, many ways is closer to Lisa Halliday than the first.\"\n\nOne of the themes Halliday explores in this book is the nature of writing itself. She pushes back against the idea that a writer cannot write about a character of another culture, and in the process, she takes on one of the most politically complicated parts of the world, the Middle East \u2014 a place she has never even visited. Imagining lives and worlds unlike your own, she says, is central to the act of creativity.\n\n\"One lives life and then dies having only been one person and I find that a difficult condition sometimes,\" she says. \"And that's why imagination and invention and empathy seems to me so important. In order not to be trapped inside our one personhood, we have to try to imagine what it's like to be other people.\"\n\nWriting, says Halliday, is a challenge that should be taken on with humility \u2014 and with the understanding that you might get something wrong. But just because a situation is complicated, she says, doesn't mean you should back away from it.", "keywords": ["writer", "lives", "thats", "second", "versus", "author", "shes", "think", "main", "asymmetry", "imagines", "halliday", "debut", "book"], "polarity": 0.09889185977421273, "subjectivity": 0.4239185553009083},

Apparently, the fabric of her bejeweled outfit pushed and pulled the opposite of the way a magnet do. [Hint: Ed Sheeran lyrics.] And despite her best efforts to keep the audience from discovering something brand new, her left breast was eventually exposed on live television.\n\nShe later told reporters it was her \"worst nightmare happening at the Olympics.\"\n\n\"I told myself, 'I don't have a choice.

Now a final collection of short stories by the National Book Award-winning author has been published posthumously. Johnson's first collection of stories, Jesus' Son attracted a devoted following that includes Philip Roth and Zadie Smith.\n\nMARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:\n\nDenis Johnson was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in fiction twice. He won the National Book Award for his 2007 novel, \"Tree Of Smoke.\" He's probably best known for his first collection of short stories, \"Jesus' Son,\" as a semi-autobiographical collection inspired by Johnson's own struggles with drugs and alcohol. He died last spring, but a much anticipated new collection of stories has just been published. Tom Vitale tells us more about the collection.\n\nTOM VITALE, BYLINE: The title story of \"The Largesse Of The Sea Maiden\" opens with a provocative image - a veteran of the war in Afghanistan is at a dinner party. Asked what was the quietest sound he ever heard. He says it was the landmine that took off one of his legs. Then another guest asks if she can see the stump. He says only if you kiss it.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nDENIS JOHNSON: Oh, well. OK, she said.\n\nVITALE: Denis Johnson read the scene at Cornell University two years ago.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nJOHNSON: And detached his prosthesis, a device of chromium bars and plastic belts strapped to his knee, which was intact, and swiveled upward horribly to present the puckered end of his leg. Deirdre got down on her bare knees before him, and he hitched forward in his seat to move the scarred stump within two inches of Deirdre's face. Now she started to cry.\n\nCHRISTIAN LORENTZEN: It's a piece of fiction of rare economy and power.\n\nVITALE: Christian Lorentzen is the book critic for New York Magazine. He says Johnson's fiction is not so much about the psychological development of his characters as it is about the style of his writing.\n\nLORENTZEN: And particularly the emphasis on voice and image over psychology makes him a very poetic writer of prose fiction.\n\nVITALE: Denis Johnson started out as a poet, publishing his first collection of verse in 1969 when he was a 19-year-old undergraduate at the University of Iowa. Twenty-three years later, he told NPR member station KCRW that the writer who most influences fiction was a poet.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)\n\nJOHNSON: Walt Whitman is definitely one of the people that I really admire. I mean, just for the largeness of his heart and the breadth and grandness of his vision. And he seemed to have the language to accommodate that.\n\nVITALE: For most of his 20s, Johnson's own talent for language was stifled by drugs and alcohol, but by his mid-30s, he was clean and sober. In 1992, he published a book of autobiographical sketches about his drug-addled youth. \"Jesus' Son\" was hailed by critics and won a cult following. In 1999, it was adapted into a film. The cast included Michael Shannon playing a 21-year-old junkie with no moral compass.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"JESUS' SON\")\n\nMICHAEL SHANNON: (As Dundun) McInnes isn't feeling too good today.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) Maybe I'll come back later.\n\nSHANNON: (As Dundun) Don't worry. I just shot him.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) You mean you killed him.\n\nSHANNON: (As Dundun) I didn't mean to.\n\nVITALE: Shannon met Dennis Johnson on the set of \"Jesus' Son\" and remained friends with him until the author's death.\n\nSHANNON: He had a deep sensitivity for people, for life. I think like a lot of artists that I admire, he found life somewhat overwhelming. And I remember his courage. You know, when he's writing these things, he's drawing from personal experience.\n\nVITALE: Johnson could also be very funny. In a story called \"Triumph Over The Grave,\" the narrator remembers going to the orthopedist for his bum knee while tripping on LSD.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nJOHNSON: The head of orthopedics approached me. He was either a large, almost gigantic person or a person who only seemed gigantic under the circumstances.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nJOHNSON: He gripped my flesh with his seething monster hands and delivered a lecture while he manipulated my lower leg and fondled the joint in preparation, I felt pretty sure, of eating me.\n\nVITALE: In 1992, Denis Johnson said that one of his models for writing was Joseph Conrad, whose goal was to tell a story without judging the characters.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nJOHNSON: He says what I want you to do is to see. If you can get the light shining out from it, then it doesn't matter how ugly it is on the surface. There's something going on underneath it if we can see it. It's the truth underlying everything, and it is the language that gets at that. I mean, it's the language that illuminates what we're seeing.\n\nVITALE: Denis Johnson's story \"Triumph Over The Grave\" ends with this language. Quote, \"it's plain to you at the time I write this I'm not dead but maybe by the time you read it.\" Johnson died of liver cancer last May at the age of 67.

The new prize announced Wednesday will recognize a work of either fiction or nonfiction translated into English and published in the U.S.\n\nExecutive Director Lisa Lucas described the move, which was approved unanimously by the foundation's board of directors, as a bid to transcend traditional boundaries and broaden the awards' scope for the sake of American readers.\n\n\"We are a nation of immigrants, and we should never stop seeking connection and insight from the myriad cultures that consistently influence and inspire us,\" she said in a statement.\n\n\"We want American readers to deeply value an inclusive, big-picture point of view, and the National Book Award for Translated Literature is part of a commitment to that principle. The addition of this award lends crucial visibility to works that have the power to touch us as American readers in search of broadened perspective.\"\n\nIt also expands a stable of prizes that for more than 20 years has numbered just four: fiction, nonfiction, poetry and young people's literature. The latter was added in 1996.\n\nThat said, as The New York Times points out, this is far from the first time the National Book Awards dabbled in a little \u2014 or a lot \u2014 of variety since their founding in 1950. At various points, the prestigious award has recognized genres as diverse as contemporary affairs, philosophy and religion, westerns, and mysteries \u2014 including separate honors for both paperback and hardcover.\n\nIn fact, the National Book Awards used to recognize excellence in translation for a span of roughly 15 years before cutting off the prize after 1983.\n\nOnly after a short-lived experiment in the 1980s, when the prizes were briefly renamed the \"American Book Awards\" and had the number of categories vastly expanded, did the National Book Awards return in their modern iteration to honor just fiction and nonfiction. Poetry, like young people's literature, was worked back into the fold later.\n\nThe new approach, which looks a little farther beyond the borders of the English-speaking world, comes just a few years after the Man Booker Prize \u2014 the premier literary award given out in the U.K. \u2014 made a big step of its own toward greater inclusion: Since 2014, the Man Booker has been open to authors beyond the Commonwealth, the confines by which it used to be defined.\n\nAs for the new National Book Awards category, the foundation says it's intended to honor both author and translator. The inaugural winner will be announced at a ceremony in New York City on Nov. 14.\n\n\"We now have the opportunity to recognize exceptional books that are written anywhere in the world,\" David Steinberger, chairman of the foundation's board of directors, said in a statement, \"and to encourage new voices and perspectives to become part of our national discourse.\"", "keywords": ["translation", "recognize", "prizes", "prize", "honoring", "add", "national", "translated", "award", "awards", "american", "literature", "works", "book", "category"], "polarity": 0.09233815426997243, "subjectivity": 0.41019283746556473},

Host Ari Shapiro talks with Rukmini Callimachi who reported the story.\n\nARI SHAPIRO, HOST:\n\nOn October 4, four American soldiers on patrol in the African country of Niger were killed in an ambush by terrorists affiliated with the Islamic State. The Pentagon promised a thorough investigation. That was months ago. And the story more or less disappeared from the public eye after that.\n\nNow a team of reporters from The New York Times has pieced together a detailed investigation into how this mission went so wrong. They found that the routine patrol was traveling not in armored vehicles but in pickup trucks and an SUV. They were unexpectedly ordered to go search the campsite of a terrorist leader who was believed to be in the area. That order pushed them further into hostile territory without air support for protection.\n\nRUKMINI CALLIMACHI: Why was this patrol that was out on a routine, low-risk mission asked to go to the suspected hideout of a known terrorist?\n\nSHAPIRO: Rukmini Callimachi went to Niger to report this story. She says the patrol eventually did find the campsite, which was empty. And at first, it seemed like the four Americans and the Nigeriens they were with would make it safely back to base.\n\nCALLIMACHI: They got there. The terrorist was not there. The campsite was empty. It was described to me as a dry hole. And they spent some time there collecting evidence. And as the sun was coming up on October 4 - they've now been out for 24 hours - they started to head home. And this is where officials and members of the patrol told us that they think a kind of complacency had set in.\n\nThis is a patrol led by American and Nigerien forces who had been out to this area many times without incident. I was told by Nigerien officials that the Nigeriens in the group had been out there 17 times without incident. The Americans, on the various bases we have in Niger, I was told have never had any contact in Niger. What comes next is what people describe as basically letting down their guard.\n\nOn their way home, they stop in the first village that they pass. It was 10 to 20 miles after the campsite. And at this point, the Nigerien forces stop their convoy because they're out of water, and they want to go to the village well. And then a series of events happen that end up delaying the convoy in a place that we now, in retrospect, know was intimately tied to Doundoun Cheffou, the very person that they were seeking out.\n\nSHAPIRO: In this village that they're in the morning of October 4, you describe a scene where the chief asks for medicine for the children. And as they're handing out the medicine, they see motorcycles leaving the village. What do they suspect that's about?\n\nCALLIMACHI: What they were seeing were the signs of something malicious being mounted. They see a couple of guys on motorcycles who speed off. In retrospect, they now think that these were the scouts for the terror group that were alerting the group that they were there. They also see groups of young men gathering. They have an unwelcoming, even menacing expression. And at one point, they see a gun. They decide to leave, and they're ambushed. According to the geolocation that we were able to do from the footage that we got of this attack, they were ambushed not even 200 yards south of the village.\n\nSHAPIRO: One of the remarkable details of this story is that you were able to obtain footage from the Americans' helmet cams. How did you get that?\n\nCALLIMACHI: We got it from a Mauritanian website called Agence Nouakchott d\u2019Information, ANI.\n\nSHAPIRO: This is a news organization from Mauritania.\n\nCALLIMACHI: Exactly. It's a news agency in the capital of Mauritania. I've known them for a long time because I used to be based in West Africa, and they have really unbelievable jihadist contacts. They often get jihadist statements before anybody else. They got the video, and we were able to obtain it from them.\n\nSHAPIRO: What did it show?\n\nCALLIMACHI: I mean, it showed something that is really heartbreaking, which is that you see two vehicles of American troops. One is a white Toyota. One is a black SUV. At one point, the white car leaves. We assume that it got away. And you see that in the black car, there are now three soldiers that are alone. And they are now completely cut off from the rest of their unit, and they're taking heavy fire. Two of them get out of the vehicle. They start walking beside the vehicle as the third soldier tries to continue driving it. They're basically using the vehicle as cover. The first one of them goes down. They try to drag him behind the cover of the vehicle, and then the enemy is upon them.\n\nAnd then the two survivors start sprinting. And they're running, and they're running, and they're running. And you just see that there's - they're completely alone. There's nobody there to help them. There's no air support. There's no cavalry coming. And then the second one goes down. You see the survivor, who I think was Staff Sergeant Dustin Wright, stop running. He ducks behind a tiny, wispy bush and tries to fire at the enemy, but there's only so much he can do. And then he too is overrun.\n\nSHAPIRO: These men died in October, and the Pentagon promised a thorough investigation. When do you think we will see it?\n\nCALLIMACHI: Well, the latest that they announced was the last week of February. I have sources telling me that they don't think it'll come out until March. There has been obviously a delay here, and I can only imagine how grueling this period must have been for the families.\n\nSHAPIRO: I should say that even though we're not focusing on it in this conversation, your article also goes into detail about these soldiers' lives before they joined the military, what their families were left with after they died...\n\nCALLIMACHI: Yes.\n\nSHAPIRO: ...And a lot more than we're discussing right now.\n\nCALLIMACHI: And I should make very clear that this was a very large team effort. I'm not the only person who wrote this piece or who contributed to it.\n\nSHAPIRO: Rukmini Callimachi is part of The New York Times team that reported the new article \"'An Endless War': Why 4 U.S. Soldiers Died In A Remote African Desert.\" Thanks so much.\n\nCALLIMACHI: It's my pleasure, Ari.

Le Guin, Whose Novels Plucked Truth From High Fantasy, Dies At 88\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Robin Marchant/Getty Images Robin Marchant/Getty Images\n\nUpdated at 7:25 p.m. ET\n\nUrsula K. Le Guin, a prolific novelist best known for the Earthsea series and The Left Hand of Darkness, died Monday at the age of 88. Across more than 20 novels and scores of short stories, Le Guin crafted fantastic worlds to grapple with profoundly difficult questions here on Earth, from class divisions to feminist theory.\n\nHer son, Theo Downes-Le Guin, confirmed to NPR that she died at her home in Portland, Ore., where she lived with her husband of more than six decades.\n\n\"She was a peaceful warrior,\" he said Tuesday, \"but for us as family, her legacy as a wife and mother is just as extraordinary.\"\n\nAcross the decades-long span of her career \u2014 from her first short story submission at the age of 11 to her work well into her 80s \u2014 Le Guin stood as a towering figure in science fiction and fantasy. Indeed, she completed a triple crown of the genres' biggest prizes, earning the Hugo, Nebula and Locus awards several times over.\n\nStill, while Le Guin deployed alien planets and impossible societies in her novels, fellow Hugo winner Mary Robinette Kowal told NPR's Petra Mayer that Le Guin's work could not be confined to a simple label found atop bookstore shelves.\n\n\"Throughout her life she embraced new forms of technology; she was constantly pushing boundaries and barriers. That is inspiring to me,\" Kowal said.\n\nA child of anthropologists, Le Guin approached her worlds with the investigative eye of one encountering a culture for the first time.\n\nIn The Left Hand of Darkness, released in 1969, interplanetary visitor Genly Ai struggles to make sense of a world in which gender is fluid \u2014 when it's not altogether absent in the androgynous natives. And in the different societies of The Dispossessed, published in 1974, Le Guin explores the frictions born of vastly different ideologies scraping up against each other.\n\nAnd, as her characters often grappled with new worlds, Le Guin herself blazed a trail rarely trod by female writers before her.\n\n\"She was one of the first really big voices in science fiction and fantasy who was a woman,\" Kowal added. \"And I think she did a lot for science fiction and fantasy \u2014 not just for women and women's roles because of her feminism but also legitimizing us as an art form. There are a lot of people who will read an Ursula Le Guin book and go, 'Well, this isn't science fiction, it's literature.' But of course, it is science fiction. A lot of times, she can be a gateway drug for people.\"\n\nFor evidence of this mainstream respect, a reader need look no further than the lifetime achievement honors bestowed on her at the 2014 National Book Awards \u2014 where she also delivered a fiery defense of the practice of literature as a whole.\n\n\"Hard times are coming,\" she warned, \"when we'll be wanting the voices of writers who can see alternatives to how we live now, can see through our fear-stricken society and its obsessive technologies to other ways of being, and even imagine real grounds for hope. We'll need writers who can remember freedom \u2014 poets, visionaries, realists of a larger reality.\"\n\nYouTube\n\nMany of those writers mourned her death on Tuesday.\n\n\"Her words are always with us. Some of them are written on my soul,\" tweeted Neil Gaiman, who presented that 2014 National Book Award to her. \"I miss her as a glorious funny prickly person, & I miss her as the deepest and smartest of the writers, too.\"\n\nHer words will live beyond her death Monday, ringing still in the worlds she opened in her fiction, poetry and essays.\n\n\"Writing is a kind of way of speaking, and I hear it,\" Le Guin told Weekend Edition in 2015. \"And I think a lot of readers hear it, too.

Liles for NPR Kevin D. Liles for NPR\n\nAs the Senate tries to hash out a deal on immigration, it's not just immigrants that have a lot at stake. So do the businesses that hire them.\n\n\"We are suffering very much from shortage of labor \u2014 skilled labor \u2014 here in Dalton,\" said Ahmed Salama, the CEO of Oriental Weavers USA, the American branch of a giant Egyptian company. Salama recently showed me around his factory in Dalton, Ga., where hulking machines weave bright-colored yarn together.\n\nDalton bills itself as the \"carpet capital of the world.\" Wall-to-wall carpeting was basically invented here after World War II. Today, Dalton is ringed by big factories that make most of the carpet sold in the U.S.\n\nIt's a conservative corner of northwest Georgia where Donald Trump won more than 70 percent of the vote. But even here, some employers are nervous that the Trump administration's immigration policies will make it harder to find enough workers.\n\n\"Two years ago, I wish I'd had this problem, because you could've wallpapered our office with the resumes,\" said Layton Roberts, the CEO of Employment Innovations Inc., a staffing company in nearby Rome, Ga. Roberts says he's scrambling to fill hundreds of job openings.\n\nBusiness is booming in Dalton. The town has finally bounced back from the Great Recession, when it suffered some of the worst job losses in the country. Now employers here have a different problem: too many open jobs, and not enough applicants to fill them.\n\nRoberts supports President Trump, who he thinks has been good for business. Still, Roberts is anxious about what the president's immigration policies could mean for the local economy. He's particularly concerned about the future of DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.\n\nDACA allows undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children to live and work here.\n\n\"What kind of impact, if those folks are gonna be deported, what's that gonna have on the labor force?\" Roberts asked. \"It's a legitimate question.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Kevin D. Liles for NPR Kevin D. Liles for NPR\n\nDACA is now at the center of the immigration debate on Capitol Hill, and in the courts. The Trump administration moved to end the program, saying that Congress needs to come up with a replacement. And employers in Dalton are worried about what happens next.\n\n\"DACA has been a big issue for us,\" said Rob Bradham, president of the Greater Dalton Chamber of Commerce. \"Just because they're valuable employees to our industries, and we don't we don't want to lose them.\" Bradham says as many as 4,000 DACA recipients live in the Dalton area.\n\nThat's not the only thing employers here are worried about.\n\nThe Trump administration has also threatened to crack down on businesses that hire undocumented immigrants. In Dalton, that's bringing back memories of the 1990s, when immigration authorities raided some of the biggest carpet mills in town. Now, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is talking about ramping up workplace raids again.\n\n\"This year you're gonna see a significant increase in worksite enforcement,\" ICE acting director Thomas Homan says. \"We gonna hold employers responsible, and take action on the employer. Plus we're going to arrest the illegal alien that's working at the site.\"\n\nIn Georgia, this should not be a problem. The state passed a law a few years ago that requires big employers to use the federal E-Verify system, an online tool that reviews paperwork Internet to ensure that workers have legal status.\n\nBut immigration lawyers say in practice, the system isn't foolproof.\n\n\"There are some employers in this area that I know of that do hire a lot of illegal immigrants, that do not have status,\" said Joseph Baldwin, a local immigration attorney. He says he's gotten calls from nervous employers.\n\n\"They're saying, I can't afford to lose these employees that are really sort of running things here,\" Baldwin said. \"You know these guys have no criminal records. They've got families. They're really part of my family now. What can we do? Unfortunately, more times than not, the answer is, there's no solution.\"\n\nCommunity leaders told me that only about 10 percent of immigrants in Dalton are here illegally, and that most do have legal status. Some have lived in Dalton for decades, raising families and starting businesses here.\n\nMariscos Puerto Vallarta is a seafood restaurant in Dalton that's owned by Mexican immigrants. Over a lunch of ceviche and fish tacos, several local businessmen said that fear and uncertainty hang over a lot of families here.\n\n\"A family that has someone with DACA, they don't know yet what's gonna happen,\" said Francisco Paniagua, who owns two car dealerships in the Dalton area. \"All these people, they could buy houses. They could buy cars, whatever. But they are afraid. They are not spending money right now, I think.\"\n\nThese community leaders say that's a problem for business.

The Chinese authorities have repeatedly assured us that Gui Minhai is a free man,\" she added. \"We expect our citizens to be released immediately and given the opportunity to meet Swedish diplomatic and medical staff.\"\n\nThe arrest Saturday marks a new twist in a tortuous series of events for Gui \u2014 who, though born in China, had to give up his Chinese citizenship when he was naturalized nearly three decades ago as a Swedish national.\n\nGui was among five publishers at Hong Kong's Causeway Bookstore who disappeared without explanation in 2015. The store had a reputation for selling books about Chinese politics banned on mainland China \u2014 and the booksellers' case elicited outrage from many people in Hong Kong who viewed it as a violation of civil liberties and encroachment on the city's autonomy.\n\nNone of these concerns were assuaged when Gui resurfaced in 2016 in Chinese custody, proclaiming his guilt for a deadly drunk-driving collision more than a decade earlier. The televised confession struck many, including the writers' advocacy organization PEN America, as \"staged.\"\n\nHe was released last October \u2014 though his daughter pointed out that that release didn't come with complete freedom: \"He was put under a police-managed flat and he was under surveillance.\"\n\nAnd she said the situation was only complicated by health problems.\n\n\"When he was released, he had developed a set of neurological symptoms that he didn't have when he was taken into custody in 2015. He had a lot of tests done and he was told that he had ALS,\" which is also known as Lou Gehrig's disease.\n\n\"Because he's a Swedish citizen,\" she continued, \"he wanted medical treatment in Sweden or elsewhere in Europe. So he had arranged with the Swedish Embassy to travel up to Beijing on Saturday by train to see a Swedish doctor who had been flown in to examine him.\"\n\nHer father's arrest \"wasn't anything that anybody expected,\" she added, \"because otherwise he wouldn't have taken that train.\"\n\nAs The New York Times reports, the Chinese foreign ministry has denied knowledge of the incident. \"This is not a matter that falls under the purview of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,\" a spokeswoman said, according to the paper. \"I don't understand this specific matter.\"\n\nThis response has not satisfied international critics, including Summer Lopez of PEN America, who condemned the incident in a statement.\n\n\"China's treatment of publisher Gui Minhai \u2014 a story of abduction, detention, and now denial of medical care \u2014 demonstrates flagrant disregard for the rule of law and human rights,\" she said.\n\nNPR's Liana Simonds contributed to this report.", "keywords": ["releasing", "publisher", "books", "months", "china", "released", "medical", "banned", "gui", "chinese", "treatment", "train", "foreign", "seizes", "swedish"], "polarity": 0.034090909090909095, "subjectivity": 0.2573355506282336},

The country's president is putting the military in charge of security there.\n\nARI SHAPIRO, HOST:\n\nViolence in Rio de Janeiro has gotten so bad that Brazil's president recently put the military in charge of security there. The recent crime wave has many people worried. Those who live near banks have particular concerns, as NPR's Philip Reeves reports.\n\nPHILIP REEVES, BYLINE: Dilza Roxo lives in quite a nice part of town. She has a sixth-floor apartment not far from Rio's Sugarloaf Mountain. Not long ago, Roxo was woken in the night by this.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF EXPLOSION)\n\nREEVES: That happened inside her building.\n\nDILZA ROXO: (Speaking Portuguese).\n\nREEVES: \"The explosion echoed across town,\" she says. \"It was really frightening.\" On the building's ground floor there's a branch of the Santander Bank. The blast, recorded on a resident's cell phone, was by a gang blowing open cash machines.\n\nROXO: (Speaking Portuguese).\n\nREEVES: Roxo says there were around 20 men with guns and ski masks. No one was hurt, but the attacks badly rattled Roxo and her husband. They're trying to move out, but it's not easy these days finding a buyer for an apartment in Rio in a building that contains a bank. An average of five banks a month were hit in and around the city last year, says Rio's Institute of Public Security. That's up a third on 2016. So far this year, the rate's even higher.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF GLASS CLATTERING)\n\nREEVES: The street is completely - there's glass scattered across the pavement here and about 10 shattered windows. There's obviously been an explosion of some force.\n\nThat's the scene at a branch of the Bank of Brazil in north Rio this month. Its cash machines were also blown up. Most residents are so frightened of reprisals by criminal gangs they won't talk about what happened. Luiza lives across the road from that bank.\n\nLUIZA: (Speaking Portuguese).\n\nREEVES: \"The explosion was like a cannon firing,\" says Luiza, who asked for her full name to be withheld for safety reasons. \"It's getting really dangerous here,\" she says.\n\nLUIZA: (Speaking Portuguese).\n\nREEVES: \"I dream of moving away.\" Analysts believe these bank robberies are mostly by drug trafficking gangs seeking another source of revenue. These gangs have plenty of weapons, says Vinicius Cavalcante, a security adviser to Rio's mayor.\n\nVINICIUS CAVALCANTE: (Speaking Portuguese).\n\nREEVES: \"Large amounts of commercial dynamite and TNT are in criminal hands,\" he says. Some of it's smuggled into Brazil from neighboring Paraguay and Bolivia. Cavalcante says the gangs often lack expertise in explosives, so when they blow open a cash machine...\n\nCAVALCANTE: (Speaking Portuguese).\n\nREEVES: Buildings get damaged and people get hit by shrapnel. Rio has become a deeply anxious city. This anxiety is about more than just banks. A war's erupted between rival drug gangs inside favelas. Deadly shootings happen every day. There's a robbery epidemic. These days, when a thief in Rio demands your cell phone...\n\nBRUNO DOS SANTOS: (Speaking Portuguese).\n\nREEVES: He might well be armed with an AK-47, says Bruno Dos Santos. Dos Santos is a community leader in North Rio. Last week, millions of people were out on Rio's streets celebrating Carnival. Not in Dos Santos' neighborhood. It canceled its street party because of worries about violence.\n\nDOS SANTOS: (Speaking Portuguese).\n\nREEVES: \"It's sad,\" says Dos Santos. \"That's the only fun we have in our community.\" Brazil's president, Michel Temer, has now stepped in. Some doubt whether Temer's decree placing Brazil's army in charge of security in Rio de Janeiro state will be effective. Few question the need for something to be done. That much was clear hours after Temer signed that decree Friday, when another bank in Rio was blown up. Philip Reeves, NPR News, Rio de Janeiro.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 NPR. All rights reserved.

Iranian-American poet Kaveh Akbar has created an online space that lets you do that without leaving your bed.\n\nAkbar runs DiveDapper, which focuses on interviews with major voices in contemporary poetry. It's packed with profiles of writers like Morgan Parker, Ocean Vuong, Wendy Xu, and Max Ritvo \u2014 to name just a few. Every other Monday, he posts a new interview transcript.\n\nThe site grew out of Akbar's own life in poetry, and his struggles with addiction. \"The oldest recognizable poem in my book ranges back to when I got sober,\" Akbar says; his debut collection, Calling a Wolf a Wolf, came out this past September. \"I suddenly had 16 hours a day to fill with something new. My entire life up to that point was predicated on the pursuit of this or that narcotic experience. When that was uplifted, I had to find something else.\"\n\nWriting became his path out of that old life. \"I was so hungry to be having conversations about the poetry that was exciting me, so starved for that sort of dialogue\" as he worked towards an MFA and split 60 hours a week between different jobs all while beginning his recovery. \"DiveDapper became a way for me to manufacture those dialogues directly with the sources.\"\n\nWhen Akbar started out, he says, he was worried that if he cold-called someone like the Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Sharon Olds, she'd be rightfully confused. Now, DiveDapper has become the way Akbar approaches great poets \u2014 but what he didn't expect was that the interviews would turn into real, substantial friendships.\n\n\"francine j harris is one of my best friends in the world now, but we met because of DiveDapper, as she started out and still is just one of my favorite poets in the world,\" Akbar says. Or take this snippet of his conversation with Olds:\n\nAkbar: \"... since I was two years old, I've been spoken to with this consciously elevated vernacular. I went through a period of being deeply self-conscious about it because I didn't want people to think I was being showy. And to make matters worse, all I've ever wanted to do is read, not unlike what you're talking about with Shakespeare. And so this is a low-level anxiety at any point in my life when I'm in conversation with anyone. Olds: Right. Now did your being born in Iran have anything to do with [your mother] wanting to help you with SAT vocabulary in English? Akbar: Oh, that's interesting. My mom is American and my dad's Iranian. I basically spent two years in Iran speaking Farsi and kind of being spoken to in English, but when we moved to America we spoke exclusively English in the house because they were dead-set on Americanizing me. Olds: Right. Akbar: I haven't talked to my mom much about it, but that might've been part of it. I think it was mainly to give me an academic advantage. Olds: Sure. If I had thought of that, I might have done it too! That's sweet and probably kind of maddening. But oh my, parents \u2014 we just want so much to do whatever we can.\"\n\nMost of the interviews on DiveDapper really are this earnest and conversational. What's more, they give us readers the chance to get to know Akbar as well as the poets he's talking to. Akbar jokes that if you've read a dozen DiveDapper interviews, you've spent an hour with a dozen different poets \u2014 and you've actually spent 12 hours with him too.\n\nThrough DiveDapper, budding poets like me get further insight not only into the process of these major voices in poetry, but also Akbar's own process.\n\nIndeed, in 2016, when I first heard Akbar reciting poems from his chapbook Portrait of the Alcoholic at a reading in Seattle, I had no idea that he was also working on DiveDapper. Nor did I know that he workshopped poems with high-school students, or that in the time between performing at book tours, readings and teaching, he'd started thinking about things like silence and how to bring it back into his life and poems. Through DiveDapper, budding poets like me get further insight not only into the process of these major voices in poetry, but also Akbar's own process.\n\n\"There are a lot of interviews where I've really gotten into the weeds of my own life,\" Akbar explains. \"A profound and beautiful and strange intimacy now exists between me and the people who have spent time on the site.\"\n\nAnd based on the interviews, here's what I know about Kaveh Akbar: He believes that everyone should be reciting poems as they walk into a coffee shop, as they do the dishes, as they go on with their lives.\n\n\"The fact that poems exist is the load-bearing gratitude upon which I have built my life,\" he explains. \"And what do you do with gratitude when it piles up? You have to push it outwards.\"\n\nTo learn how to live my life in joyous grateful service of poetry \u2014 that's everything.\n\nHe says it's sort of like eating a Snickers bar. \"Not sharing your gratitude is like holding a Snickers bar in your mouth for a week. You'd just get cavities,\" he laughs. \"This is what I want to do with DiveDapper. As far as I'm concerned, poetry is the best thing that exists in the universe.\"\n\n\"These are the people whose words have shaped my psychic algorithm,\" he says of his interviewees. \"Their language has shaped the way I think about the world. They're part of my consciousness at the level of the neuron. To hear how they did it, how they do it, has been immensely useful to me as a practicing poet and as a human being. To learn how to live my life in joyous grateful service of poetry \u2014 that's everything.\"\n\nJeevika Verma is a poet and writer from India.", "keywords": ["thats", "poems", "interviews", "poet", "poetrys", "divedapper", "spent", "biggest", "cheerleader", "poetry", "akbar", "kaveh", "life", "poets"], "polarity": 0.17494588744588743, "subjectivity": 0.44455810551700964},

The partnership between the U.S. and Pakistan has been in the dumps lately. President Trump recently accused Pakistan of harboring terrorists. The U.S. withheld hundreds of millions of dollars in military assistance. And now, to increase the pressure even more, the U.S. is trying to make it harder for Pakistan to access international financial markets.\n\nNPR's Diaa Hadid joins us from Islamabad. Hi, Diaa.\n\nDIAA HADID, BYLINE: Hey there, Ari.\n\nSHAPIRO: Explain what the U.S. is trying to do here.\n\nHADID: Right. So there's a body called the Financial Action Task Force, and it sets standards to combat money laundering and to counter terrorist financing. And they're meeting this week in Paris. And one thing they're going to do is review how Pakistan has halted its terrorist financing or not. And that's come under particular focus because the U.S. and other Western countries have requested that Pakistan go on what's called a gray list. And that would make it harder for Pakistan to obtain international loans and for investors to come here. That would be a punishment for Pakistan because the economic situation right now is quite precarious.\n\nSHAPIRO: What are they trying to pressure Pakistan to actually do here?\n\nHADID: So the United States accuses Pakistan of sponsoring terrorist groups, including elements of the Taliban, and they want them to stop. And that includes halting their ability to obtain finance.\n\nSHAPIRO: Is Pakistan worried about potentially being placed on this list?\n\nHADID: Definitely. And Pakistan says that it is fighting terrorism. It denies that it sponsors any terrorist groups. And they say that the goal posts keep moving on what they're meant to be doing. With all that said, actually, last week they cracked down on two Islamic groups that are linked to a radical cleric who's wanted by the United States. And they've seized assets belonging to those groups, including a hospital, some dispensaries, some ambulances, some schools and a university.\n\nSHAPIRO: Does that show that the U.S. pressure is working then?\n\nHADID: Yes and no. So I spoke to diplomats this week, and they say the crackdown is a good start. But what they say is that in the past, Pakistan has cracked down on these groups, but then as soon as the pressure's off it quietly reverts back to funding them again or a new front pops up and they just let that one operate. So what they want to see here is permanence. And that's their key word. The thing is that there is some optimism, actually, that this might work.\n\nSHAPIRO: You say that these groups linked to terrorism use charities as a front, hospitals and things like that. What do those charities actually look like? How widespread are they in Pakistani society?\n\nHADID: Right. So we went to a small medical clinic. And it was on the outskirts of town. It's in a deeply poor, impoverished area. And there were patients crowding in, waiting for help. But the government-appointed doctor hadn't arrived. The clinic had already been taken over by the government. And so there was a clinical assistant who's hired by one of these Islamic charities who was there helping them all out. And the patients were worried. They say that that kind of reflected what happens in government clinics where they don't really get help, or the help they get is shoddy.\n\nWe spoke to one woman who'd come with her baby who was sick. You can hear her speaking in Urdu, and then our colleague, Abdul Sattar, translates for her.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: (Through interpreter) They do not examine properly. You go in the morning and until 2 o'clock you keep on waiting. And even then, doctor will just come and he will not examine properly. But here you come, the child is examined properly and medicine is given properly.\n\nHADID: You can see from what she was saying why there's such an appeal for these groups and why it's hard for Pakistan to actually crack down on them.\n\nSHAPIRO: NPR's Diaa Hadid in Islamabad, Pakistan, thanks so much.\n\nHADID: Thank you, Ari.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.

NPR takes a look at where young people's literature is now and where the new ambassador would like to take it in the coming year.\n\nKELLY MCEVERS, HOST:\n\nAt the Library of Congress today, Gene Luen Yang officially ended his tenure as national ambassador for young people's literature and handed the baton to Jacqueline Woodson. She is the sixth children's book author to hold the position. And for the next two years, she will be encouraging children and teenagers to read and to read more. NPR's Lynn Neary talked to the two writers about the job.\n\nLYNN NEARY, BYLINE: Gene Luen Yang admits that when he became ambassador two years ago, he was a little disappointed. He thought the job would come with a few more perks.\n\nGENE LUEN YANG: Yeah. I thought there would be a crown and maybe, like, a helicopter of some kind, but none of that happened.\n\nNEARY: As she takes on the job, Jacqueline Woodson has no illusions about the perks. But if anything, she has higher expectations.\n\nJACQUELINE WOODSON: My hope is that by that time I'm no longer national ambassador I'll have changed the world.\n\nNEARY: OK. So the national ambassador for young people's literature may not be the most powerful position in the nation's capital, but Yang says it has rewards of a different kind.\n\nYANG: At a very fundamental level, I got to go to all these different places. I got to hear voices. You know, I got to hear the voices of kids.\n\nNEARY: Each ambassador gets to choose his or her own mission. For example, Jon Scieszka, who held the position first, was particularly interested in encouraging young boys to read. Yang, an award-winning graphic novelist, challenged kids to step out of their comfort zones and read about different kinds of people, unfamiliar topics or new types of books.\n\nYANG: The nation is getting more diverse. And that is reflected in the material that draws the kids in. And I mean diversity in every sense of the word, not just cultural diversity, but also diversity of format. You know, I think kids today are more open to more different kinds of stories than kids in the past.\n\nNEARY: Yang is thrilled to be handing over the job to Jacqueline Woodson, winner of numerous awards, including the National Book Award for her memoir, \"Brown Girl Dreaming.\"\n\nWOODSON: I get to decide my own vision in the end about the work I want to do, how I want to do it, what rooms I want to walk into, what people I feel have not had the kind of access that they should have - mainly underserved people, people in rural communities, incarcerated people - and really point my energies in those directions.\n\nNEARY: Woodson says she'd love to get rid of labels like struggling reader or advanced reader and encourage young people to concentrate more on how a book makes them feel or think.\n\nWOODSON: Labeling is not the best way to get young people to deeply engage in reading. I mean, at the end of the day, you take the qualifier away and they're a reader. Childhood, young adulthood is fluid. And it's very easy to get labeled very young and have to carry something through your childhood and into your adulthood that is not necessarily who you are.\n\nNEARY: Woodson has come up with her own mathematical equation to spark conversation about literature.\n\nWOODSON: Reading equals hope times change. So of course it's that play on words, but it's also the fact that we come to books looking for the hope in them. And when we close a book, we're a different person than when we first opened that book. And reading begins a conversation. And my hope is that we can start having these conversations that literature triggers around the country.\n\nNEARY: Woodson sees the job ahead of her as a continuum of the work that her predecessors have started. Looking back on his own tenure, Gene Luen Yang says the national conversation Woodson hopes for is already underway.\n\nYANG: I think that human storytelling is this long conversation about what it means to exist, what it means to live, how to live a good life. And I think being ambassador has just reinforced the importance of that conversation in my mind.\n\nNEARY: Like her predecessors, Jacqueline Woodson will be traveling all over the country to meet with young people. No helicopters or private planes will be involved. Lynn Neary, NPR News, Washington.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF JACK WILKINS' \"RED CLAY\")\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 NPR. All rights reserved.

That's especially true in Wisconsin, where candidates for the state's open Supreme Court seat are talking about President Trump. Wisconsin Public Radio's Shawn Johnson reports.\n\nSHAWN JOHNSON, BYLINE: Normally, candidates in officially nonpartisan Wisconsin Supreme Court races would spend their time discussing judicial philosophy or who's tougher on crime. And you could see some of that when Judge Rebecca Dallet released her first TV ad in this race. There was footage of Dallet wearing her black robe in a courtroom. But what stood out in this spot was the beginning. She started it with grainy, black-and-white footage of President Donald Trump.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN: He's attacked our civil rights and our values. She'll protect them.\n\nJOHNSON: Another candidate for the court, attorney Tim Burns, has gone even farther. At a recent forum hosted by the Milwaukee chapter of the Federalist Society, Burns told the conservative lawyers and judges in attendance that they were to blame for Trump's presidency, calling the president a, quote, \"perverse show dog.\"\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nTIM BURNS: You now helped that demagogue pack our federal courts, and you sit silently by as he destroys our moral standing in the world.\n\nJOHNSON: In Wisconsin, candidates for state Supreme Court have typically found ways to hint at their partisan leanings without coming out and saying it, but they haven't nationalized what's really a state race. Former state Supreme Court Justice Janine Geske can't remember candidates ever attacking a president the way they have this year.\n\nJANINE GESKE: No. You know, and it was interesting when I ran way back when. Sometimes, when you went to small towns, that's what people wanted to talk about, were national issues and things. And we were just saying, you know, that's really not what the Supreme Court deals with.\n\nJOHNSON: Geske thinks there's a lot to be said for having the judicial branch more detached from politics. However...\n\nGESKE: These are odd political times, so it might not work in a future election. But it's probably a good time to try it considering all the turmoil in our political system.\n\nJOHNSON: Tim Burns is the one going all in on this. He's described himself in no uncertain terms as a liberal and a Democrat, and says Trump's victory in 2016 is part of the reason he decided to run for the court. Speaking after the Federalist Society debate where he attacks Trump, Burns says that candor is what the public expects from candidates.\n\nBURNS: Most people think the key issue of the day is we have a megalomaniac in Washington. And if I don't speak to that, what do - am I to voters in the sense of telling them what my values are? They want to know.\n\nJOHNSON: Former Justice Geske says Burns has likely forced Dallet's hand in this race. That's because they're potentially chasing the same bloc of voters. Both Burns and Dallet condemned Trump recently when he reportedly made disparaging remarks about several African nations. They also pressured the conservative candidate in the race, Judge Michael Screnock, to take a stand on the president's remarks. Screnock did not, and he says he won't.\n\nMICHAEL SCRENOCK: I don't comment on what our mayors say. I don't comment on what our county board chairperson says. I don't comment on what the governor says or what the president says. It's not the role of a judge to weigh into those things.\n\nJOHNSON: The top two vote-getters in the February primary will advance to the April election. The question is, who's taking the bigger gamble - the candidates tapping into the national mood or the candidate avoiding it?

These Books Might Actually Help\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Kristen Meinzer Courtesy of Kristen Meinzer\n\nIt's the second week of 2018, and if you are still resolved to improve your life in this new year, Jolenta Greenberg and Kristen Meinzer may be able to help. They host a podcast called By The Book, and for each episode, they choose one self-help book and live by its rules for a couple of weeks. So they're well-equipped to tell us which of these books has actually improved their lives \u2014 and which ones to avoid.\n\nOn Greenberg's recommendation, The Life-Changing Magic Of Tidying Up by Marie Kondo\n\nGreenberg: I love it. I feel like especially in the New Year, it's just a real nice way to cleanse your space and make it feel kind of brand new. And I think it's something that most Americans could probably use to do. I know I could. I like buying stuff. For me, it's clothes and squirrel-related tchotchkes, and they accumulate, you know? And sometimes you might have to go through all your clothes or squirrel collection and hold each item and think about, does this really bring me joy? Or am I keeping it out of obligation? Has it already served its purpose? And to just sort of purge all of these things we let build up around us that don't necessarily make us happy anymore.\n\nMeinzer: I think the lifestyle is absurd. It's ridiculous. You know, she cannot have anything on a counter-top. She cannot have any art on walls. If you want anything pretty, you put it inside your closet so when you open your closet you can look at your art. But anything that's out for the world to see is considered clutter. All of this is ridiculous to me and so this book made me very mad, and my husband and I, who love each other very much, fought while we were living this book, and you can hear it in our show. And it's because he got sick of the fact that every time he took a shower, he had to take the shampoo out of a separate cupboard, bring it to the shower and then afterward wipe it off, thank it, and put it in a cupboard.\n\nOn Meinzer's recommendation, America's Cheapest Family Gets You Right On The Money by Steve and Annette Economides\n\nMeinzer: This family is amazing. They've paid off their house, their cars, all of their clothes are second-hand. They only go grocery shopping one day a month, because if you go grocery shopping more you'll be tempted to do some impulse buying, so they do one giant grocery shopping trip a month and then they make a months' worth of frozen meals and they do all sorts of wacky things like that, and I just loved it. And they have three levels of how to live their lifestyle, so even if you're a beginner, if you're not ready to go grocery shopping only one time for the whole month, maybe you can start off by going grocery shopping only once a week.\n\nGreenberg: I feel like Kristen does, sort of, about Marie Kondo, where if you try to live the way they do \u2014 like they are crazy people. Most people who write self-help books are. They're very extreme people. They say shop once a month, and basically you only have fresh food for first week of that month, but they also say you know planning meals helps cut down on impulse purchases, which I did, you know, sort of take to heart and I try to plan meals more so when I go grocery shopping I don't just go nuts. But I do buy vegetables every week.\n\nOn the book they both advise everyone to avoid in the New Year\n\nGreenberg: We both agree on Men are from Mars, Women Are From Venus by John Gray. ... This book, according to Time magazine, is the bestselling non-fiction book of the '90s. So my parents had this book; everyone's parent's had this book. And Kristen and I are both relative newlyweds, and I was super excited to read this book and gain some actual insights on married life. But turns out, we found it to be incredibly sexist and really condescending towards women.\n\nMeinzer: Yeah, I mean, if you're a woman, your job is basically just to validate your man and stop nagging him so much, and not be upset when he doesn't speak to you for weeks or months at a time.\n\nGreenberg: Don't forget \"knight in shining armor,\" a phrase used often in this book. It's basically men have to feel like a knight in shining armor. Otherwise, like, they will leave you.\n\nOn how people should approach self-help books\n\nMeinzer: I think they should listen to our show and hear how our lives are ruined by a lot of these books! Listen to our show and hear what parts of information work for Jolenta or work for me. So if somebody listens to the show and they know from day one, [they're] a Jolenta, they know that America's Cheapest Family Gets You Right on the Money is going to make them want to throw themselves off a bridge ... and when Jolenta is loving some aspect of a book that gives her a chance to look at her throat chakras and then light candles and rub her crystals, and I want to just punch all the crystals, people know, oh, this is a better book for Jolenta and not a good book for Kristen.", "keywords": ["help", "books", "grocery", "jolenta", "feel", "think", "month", "kristen", "know", "shopping", "actually", "book"], "polarity": 0.17564218948547314, "subjectivity": 0.6095855678318367},

Friday's indictment spelled out some of the ways Russia set up front groups on social media to inflame political divisions in the U.S. And Dwayne Wright's photo wound up in one of those front groups.\n\nDwayne Wright is the chairman of the San Jacinto County Republican Party. It's a county just north of Houston, Texas. The group that shared his photo was called Heart of Texas. And Chairman Dwayne Wright joins us now. Welcome.\n\nDWAYNE WRIGHT: Thanks for having me.\n\nSHAPIRO: Heart of Texas was a secessionist group with a quarter-million followers before Facebook shut it down. Describe the photo of you that the group shared.\n\nWRIGHT: Well, it was a photo - we actually prepared a PVC pipe jail cell, and we had put a cutout of Hillary Clinton inside there. And then there was the cutout likeness of Donald Trump standing next to it with a - like, a sheriff's badge on. And I was standing next to Trump, you know, with my thumb up, you know, basically saying that it was a pretty good deal that we actually had her in jail.\n\nSHAPIRO: What was your reaction when you learned that this image had been shared on Facebook by a Russian group claiming to be Americans?\n\nWRIGHT: Yeah, I was actually caught off guard. It was Friday, and we were doing our last-minute preparation for one of our events. And I got a call from the group ThinkProgress about it. And I just had to laugh 'cause it blew my mind. You know, you're a little bit flattered but quite disturbed at the same time because there are so many people that are chasing this Russian collusion narrative. And then we're just, you know, thinking about, well, how is that going to negatively affect us?\n\nSHAPIRO: I also wonder whether it makes you doubt your own social media impact. If this group of Russians had a quarter-million followers, do you wonder about whether your own support is all actually coming from people who are who they say they are?\n\nWRIGHT: Well, no. Actually, we've got a good handle on that because all of our social media growth - I'm the webmaster, by the way - all of our growth was organic prior to any of this. And we did not see any metrics change from what they did.\n\nSHAPIRO: Had you heard of this group, Heart of Texas, which encourages Texas to secede from the U.S.?\n\nWRIGHT: Absolutely not. I - actually, Friday was the first time I've ever heard of them. And it was actually a photo taken by Breitbart Texas. And, you know, there was an article. And they took pieces of the article and put some of their own messaging in there.\n\nSHAPIRO: It says, Dwayne Wright extremely ably visualized what is on the mind of so many American citizens. What do you think?\n\nWRIGHT: I wouldn't have written it that way (laughter). And I noticed there was some words that were misspelled at the bottom. I believe build was misspelled. To me, it just rang that it was not of this area, you know?\n\nSHAPIRO: There are aspects of this that are easy to kind of laugh at and make fun of, but intelligence agencies say Russians are trying to inflame divisions in American society and this was part of a widespread, coordinated campaign. Do you worry that your photo is helping a foreign country undermine American democracy?\n\nWRIGHT: Well, if that's the case, then obviously I'm not a proponent of that. I think it's sad that they feel like they need to interfere in our elections. And in a way, it tarnishes our message because the media narrative is that the Russians are trying to create discord in our country. Well, if they're aligning with the message that we're using, of course that's disconcerting to us.\n\nSHAPIRO: I wonder, in San Jacinto County, Texas, where you are, how are people responding to the fact that your photo appeared on this Facebook page from a Russian group?\n\nWRIGHT: Well, you know, it's funny. We had our major annual fundraiser Saturday. So when I was onstage, I spoke to people about what happened.\n\nSHAPIRO: Oh, really?\n\nWRIGHT: Oh, yeah. They were shocked and amazed. You know, in a way, it was kind of awesome that this little, tiny county is the one that is being - one of the ones that's being chosen to be plagiarized. And so actually, everybody thought it was funny.\n\nSHAPIRO: Dwayne Wright, chairman of the San Jacinto Republican Party near Houston, Texas, thank you for joining us today.\n\nWRIGHT: Well, thanks for calling, Ari.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.

I wrote that U is for Undertow was so good, \"it makes me wish there were more than 26 letters at her disposal.\" Now, of course, that line falls flat.\n\nThe Week's Best Stories From NPR Books 'Y Is For Yesterday': Sue Grafton's Penultimate Mystery Series Novel 'Y Is For Yesterday': Sue Grafton's Penultimate Mystery Series Novel Listen \u00b7 6:35 6:35\n\nAs Grafton's fans know, the writer died of cancer on Dec. 28. Her last novel was Y is for Yesterday, which came out last summer. Turns out, there were only 25 letters at her disposal.\n\nIn interviews, Grafton always described hitting upon the strategy of alphabet titles for her novels as a whim. She said she got the idea after reading Edward Gorey's alphabet picture book, The Gashlycrumb Tinies, in which children die in grisly ways (\"B is for Basil assaulted by bears,\" \"G is for George smothered under a rug\" and so on).\n\nBut what started out as a lark became \u2014 if I may say this of a \"mere\" mystery series \u2014 something defiant, noble even. Because a series that projects itself to the end of the alphabet is a race against limitations: the limitations of time and the imagination.\n\nTime ran out on Grafton, but her creative stamina barely flagged. Sure, not every one of her novels was a standout (how could that be when there were so many of them?), but lots of the recent ones, like the aforementioned Y, were terrific and, as the series went on, her plots grew more intricate, increasingly haunted by the past and its crimes.\n\nThroughout the series, Grafton's detective heroine, Kinsey Millhone, maintained her cheeky humor and cherished autonomy. Kinsey lived alone in what we would now call a \"tiny house\" and relied on that one black dress to see her through funerals and parties. She drank rotgut wine and refused to be cowed by patriarchal authority and the parasitic rich.\n\nIn short, Kinsey was a fictional alter ego for every shy woman who hesitated to talk back. Grafton said she counted herself among those shy women.\n\nI reread Kinsey's debut, A is for Alibi, every few years for the detective fiction course I teach. It came out in 1982, a signature moment in hardboiled history. (Sara Paretsky introduced her gal gumshoe, V.I. Warshawski, that very same year.)\n\nThings were pretty bleak before then for women in hardboiled mysteries \u2014 the two available roles were either femme fatale or corpse. But Grafton, Paretsky and other sleuthing sisters like Liza Cody, Eleanor Taylor Bland and pioneer Marcia Muller picked the locks on the doors of what had been mostly a men's club. They tossed out the genre's sexist, racist and nativist clich\u00e9s along with its moldy cast of usual suspects \u2014 chief among them those emasculating femmes fatales.\n\nOnce those female private eyes and police detectives went to work investigating what Raymond Chandler famously called \"a world gone wrong,\" the villains began to look radically different: mostly male and white. And in these feminist mysteries, evil wasn't imported into America from some exotic locale like it was, say, in The Maltese Falcon; rather, it sat squarely on Main Street \u2014 in banks, churches and corporations.\n\nGrafton and that post-'60s generation of mystery writers revolutionized what had become fossilized formula fiction. They helped make the detective novel matter again.\n\nBecause of those quirky alphabet titles and Kinsey's humor, Grafton's novels were sometimes regarded as \"lighter\" than those of her colleagues. They shouldn't be. Those trademark wisecracks of Kinsey's were often wrapped around barbed social commentary. Here's Kinsey in A is for Alibi describing the tedium of her workday, most of it spent:\n\n... checking and cross-checking, filling in blanks, detail work. ... The basic characteristics of any good investigator are a plodding nature and infinite patience. Society has inadvertently been grooming women to this end for years.\n\nThe conclusion of A is for Alibi is deadly serious. It's an ingenious feminist rewriting of one of the most hateful mystery endings of all time: Mickey Spillane's misogynist masterpiece, I, The Jury. I won't spoil the fun; just think Sigmund Freud and womb imagery triumphantly vanquishing the phallic symbol.\n\nI'd like to think there's something fitting in the way Grafton's alphabet series is almost, but not quite, complete. The greatest hardboiled mysteries never conclude with neat solutions, but rather with ambiguity. Grafton planned to call her last novel Z is for Zero; but, like so many of Kinsey's cases, it remains open.", "keywords": ["graftons", "novel", "grafton", "y", "mystery", "appreciation", "novels", "alphabet", "sue", "kinseys", "helped", "series", "transform", "genre"], "polarity": 0.09628205128205128, "subjectivity": 0.46720085470085476},

But some people believe the problem is with society breakdown not guns.\n\nARI SHAPIRO, HOST:\n\nThose students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School also have their eye on Congress. They're planning a big gun control rally in Washington next month. They've received a lot of praise from around the country, but as North Country Public Radio's Brian Mann reports, the students are also getting pushback from conservative media.\n\nBRIAN MANN, BYLINE: Yesterday afternoon, Cameron Kasky was doing live TV appearances one after another.\n\nCAMERON KASKY: Yeah, I don't know if you saw us on the networks today. Everybody's listening. Everybody cares.\n\nMANN: Kasky is a junior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, a survivor of Wednesday's mass shooting. He's one of the organizers of the Never Again movement. He says it's time for new gun control laws, safer schools, an end to the NRA's powerful role in American politics.\n\nKASKY: Change is going to be seen everywhere. If people can't sleep at night knowing that they've lost family members, they can at least know that nobody else is going to have to do that again.\n\nMANN: These kids have blown up on TV and across social media, but there's one place where their message is falling flat.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"FOX NEWS SUNDAY\")\n\nCHRIS WALLACE: Now let's bring in the king of conservative talk radio, Rush Limbaugh, live from...\n\nMANN: In conservative media - the TV, websites and talk radio favored by tens of millions of Americans - the Parkland story sounds very different. Limbaugh appeared on \"Fox News Sunday\" with Chris Wallace.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"FOX NEWS SUNDAY\")\n\nWALLACE: What do you think of this idea of students mobilizing across the country, a march on Washington, a march in communities?\n\nMANN: Limbaugh described the Parkland students as articulate and angry, but he also said they're being used by the left and by Democrats in a bid to take away people's gun rights. The real answer, Limbaugh said, is more guns in schools.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"FOX NEWS SUNDAY\")\n\nRUSH LIMBAUGH: The solution, to me - and I know this is going to cause all kinds of angst - the solution is we need concealed carry in these schools.\n\nMANN: Across conservative media, the narrative after Parkland is that shootings like this aren't really about guns. They're about a breakdown in the fabric of American society, about disintegrating families, a lack of Christian values. Tucker Carlson founded a popular conservative website called Daily Caller and hosts a show on Fox.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nTUCKER CARLSON: Every thoughtful person knows something horrible is going on in American society. Tragedies like this happen for a reason, and it probably doesn't have a lot to do with guns.\n\nMANN: This is a message that Republican politicians in particular hear a lot in the media they follow most closely. It was echoed in President Trump's speech to the nation right after the Parkland shooting.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH)\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We must also work together to create a culture in our country that embraces the dignity of life, that creates deep and meaningful human connections, and that turns classmates and colleagues into friends and neighbors.\n\nMANN: A lot of Americans agree. They say guns aren't the problem. Mimi and Manuel Garcia from North Carolina were visiting the Parkland area this week, donating blood after the shooting.\n\nMIMI GARCIA: Unfortunately, there's evil in the world. And, you know, people are just going, you know, for that instead of, you know, peace, love and God, you know?\n\nMANUEL GARCIA: I believe that, you know, a lot of things are happening because we took God out of the school system. We took prayer out of the school system. And this is why all this is happening.\n\nMANN: If you believe this, that society is breaking down, then more guns might seem like a reasonable response, a last-ditch way to keep teachers and students safe. Sabrina Belony is a stay-at-home mom in Fort Lauderdale.\n\nSABRINA BELONY: I feel like they should put guns in the classrooms now with the teachers. I feel like teachers should be trained to be armed for something because teachers lost their lives trying to protect his class.\n\nMANN: The kids who formed the Never Again movement have no patience for this idea that culture is to blame for Wednesday's massacre. They say Parkland is already a great town, a tight-knit community with strong values. They say the real problem is that weak gun laws allowed one deeply troubled teen to buy a semi-automatic rifle legally. Emma Gonzalez, a Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School senior, spoke at an anti-gun rally over the weekend.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nEMMA GONZALEZ: Every politician who is taking donations from the NRA, shame on you.\n\n(CHEERING)\n\nMANN: So far, at least, their message is getting heard. Gonzalez's speech went viral on social media, and the students have scheduled a town hall-style meeting for Wednesday that will air on CNN.

Jared Moskowitz who represents Parkland where last week's fatal school shootings occurred about whether any new gun regulations will go anywhere.\n\nARI SHAPIRO, HOST:\n\nStudents from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida spent the weekend urging lawmakers to get tougher on guns. They were on social media, on TV and at rallies. In a moment, we'll hear more about them and how some conservatives are responding to their message. First, Florida's Legislature has three weeks left in this session, and the shooting has suddenly made gun laws a central issue. Jared Moskowitz is a Democrat who represents the Parkland area in Florida's House of Representatives. Welcome.\n\nJARED MOSKOWITZ: Good afternoon.\n\nSHAPIRO: First of all, I understand this shooting was more personal to you than it was to many Florida lawmakers. You are a graduate of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.\n\nMOSKOWITZ: Yeah, Parkland is a town that I grew up in. I went to Marjory Stoneman Douglas. I graduated in '99. I drive on those roads past the school almost daily. My 4-year-old son goes to preschool around the corner. This is my backyard. I know these people.\n\nSHAPIRO: And so how did you spend this weekend?\n\nMOSKOWITZ: This weekend's been difficult. It's been going to funerals, going to vigils, talking to students, talking to parents. It's been dealing with the next three weeks of session, trying to get something accomplished. If we don't get it done by March 9, we don't meet again until December after the 2018 elections. I'm attending funerals where people are screaming and cursing into the microphone based on their anger. They're looking at their teenage son or daughter in pine boxes, ready to be put in the ground, all because they sent their kid to school. That's the only thing that they did.\n\nAnd I think to myself, I have a 4 year old. What if the shooter didn't go to Douglas? He went around the corner to my son's preschool. And what if he had gotten to my child? Would I decide to bury my son in his favorite pajamas? Would I take his favorite stuffed animal? These are the things that have been going through my head as I watch parents go through that identical exercise with their teenage child.\n\nAnd I think to myself it has to be different. Washington is broken. Nothing's going to happen in Washington. But Tallahassee has three weeks. We have three weeks. We have a unique opportunity. Pulse did not happen during session. And they did not want to come back into session after Pulse.\n\nSHAPIRO: The Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando.\n\nMOSKOWITZ: That's correct. I led the effort to try to get a special session. And there were not enough votes to take us into special session. Enough folks on the other side of the aisle voted against going into special session. And then the headline changed, and we did nothing. It was back to business as usual. So we must come together as Democrats and Republicans and figure out how we change the laws.\n\nSHAPIRO: So you attend these vigils and these funerals as a parent, as a member of a community, as a graduate of the high school and as a lawmaker. And do people come up to you? Did people approach you over the weekend and say, as a lawmaker, this is what I want you to do?\n\nMOSKOWITZ: People are coming up to me. They're calling me. They're emailing me. They're texting me. They want meaningful gun control. They want something to happen with assault weapons and rifles. People don't understand how an 18 year old can buy an AR-15 but he can't have a beer. He can't even rent a car from Alamo or Enterprise. We've deemed that - we've deemed it unsafe for a teenager to go rent a car but not unsafe to have an AR-15 and extended magazines and enough ammo to go to war on the streets of America.\n\nSHAPIRO: When you talk with your Republican colleagues in the Legislature, and you say, I want to do all of these many things, is there one or two that they say, well, we can definitely get on board with that?\n\nMOSKOWITZ: I think raising the age to be able to have an AR-15, raising that to the age of - the same age it would take to buy a handgun. I think increased background checks. I think waiting periods. I think those are things that like-minded Democrats and Republicans, people trying to find common ground, parents from both sides of the aisle can get behind.\n\nSHAPIRO: Florida's Governor Rick Scott has said that everything is on the table. He also has a lot of support from gun rights groups. He has an A-plus rating from the NRA. Do you think he would embrace anything that the Legislature might pass?\n\nMOSKOWITZ: Well, I would say listen. Just like in school, you're an A-plus student until you get an F on a paper. And so anybody right now that has an A-plus for the NRA is more than welcome to come get an F. The governor has been on the ground. He's been to the school. He's been to the funerals. He's been talking to parents. He has seen this firsthand. He can have the largest impact over anybody else in Tallahassee by dictating the debate and what he wants to see on his desk. And so when he says that all options are on the table, well, based on my conversations with the folks that I'm having at the governor's office, all options are on the table. They are looking at all sorts of different ideas. I've not seen pen to paper yet, but it's only Monday.\n\nSHAPIRO: You saw that after the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, the state Legislature did nothing. What makes you think this time will be different?\n\nMOSKOWITZ: I unfortunately think that because it's children and that it happened in the safest city in the state of Florida, which means this circus can come to your town, that we're in session, and we're in election year, that it was just so horrific what happened and so predictable and so easy to stop. And the students have been the best advocate. They have been the difference. They are the difference-maker. Forget the legislators. The students have been the ones that have been able to articulate this message so clearly of what the failures were, what they want to see. And they're not just talk. They're action. They're coming up to Tallahassee. They understand there's a limited window here to do something.\n\nSHAPIRO: Jared Moskowitz, Democrat representing the Parkland area in Florida's House of Representatives, thank you very much for joining us.\n\nMOSKOWITZ: Thank you for the time.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 NPR.

We need to have enough grip so that the skate can get a good push off it. But then we want them to glide as far as possible, so that there's less effort expended for the long distance.\"\n\nLong track ice is built to be about 1 inch thick, and, Messer says, it needs to be as dense as possible to make it stronger. To accomplish that, the ice team filters the water to take almost all the minerals out.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Ed Jones/AFP/Getty Images Ed Jones/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\"We leave a little bit in there to kind of hold everything together,\" he says, \"and the other thing that we have to get out is air.\"\n\nStanding rinkside as skaters take practice runs around the pristine, gleaming Oval, Messer has the look of a satisfied craftsman.\n\n\"Yeah, it looks good,\" he says, noticing a dusting of what looks like light snow kicked up in the corners. \"When they're skating and the ice is hard, you get a little puff of snow, and if they're goin' in there and there are chunks comin' out, then we know we've gone a little bit too hard.\"\n\nGood ice, he says, has a certain sound, too: \"Very nice and quiet. If it's not good ice, the blades will kinda grind in the ice. And it's a nice and clean sound here.\"\n\nMesser, who has made ice in five Olympics, strives for perfection.\n\n\"Our mantra is that we don't say, 'That's good enough.' It's always, 'Is that as good as it can be?' And that's what we try to do here.\"\n\nSo far in the Pyeongchang Olympics, long track speedskaters have set six Olympic records on the Oval. Nothing makes Messer happier.\n\n\"I still get a thrill when I see people crossing the finish line with a good time,\" he says. \"That's incredible. We take a huge pride in that.\"\n\nSkaters will tell you they know instantly if the ice is great or not.\n\n\"One of the first things we do when we step on the ice is, like, 'How's this ice?' \" says Lana Gehring, who's on the U.S. short track speedskating team.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Amin Mohammad Jamali/Getty Images Amin Mohammad Jamali/Getty Images\n\nSpeedskaters get a lot of information transmitted through a blade that's just a millimeter thick.\n\n\"All that input is coming directly up to our body,\" she says, \"so we're able to tell right away if it's dense, if it's grippy, if it's breaky, if it's too rough.\"\n\nThe ice for short track speedskating is thicker and warmer than long track ice. Hockey ice: a bit warmer still.\n\nBut in the games, short track speedskating shares a rink with figure skating. Two totally different sports with different ice needs are holding competitions in the same ice arena.\n\nThe arena's ice meister, Remy Boehler of France, explains that figure skaters need warmer, thicker, more supple ice so they can dig in for jumps. If the ice is too hard and cold, it will \"explode\" when they land, he warns. But short track speedskaters need colder, faster ice in that same venue.\n\nIt takes about three hours to adjust the temperature from one sport to the other.\n\nThe best way for Boehler to tell if he's got it right? \"What I use most are my ears,\" he says. \"I use them all the time. When I arrive, I take off my cap so I can really listen to the sound of the blades, if they're gliding or cracking.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Roland Harrison/Action Plus via Getty Images Roland Harrison/Action Plus via Getty Images\n\nAnd when the ice is great, he can tell by the skaters' faces. They'll take to the ice \u2014 and smile.\n\n\"That's the best feeling of all,\" he says.\n\nAnd then there's ice for curling \u2014 a totally different animal.\n\nLook closely at the ice sheets, and you'll see they're not smooth. They're textured with tiny dots called pebbles.\n\nThe ice meister of the Winter Olympics curling venue, Hans Wuthrich of Gimli, Manitoba, says his team uses pebbling cans with 25 different pebble heads to sprinkle the ice with droplets. The idea is to reduce friction.\n\n\"Those wee little water droplets,\" he says, \"they're the thing that touches the bottom of the curling stone. That's what the rock actually rides on and makes it go easy. And that's also what makes it curl.\"\n\nSo when you're watching these Olympics, think for a moment about the ice meisters. They devote their lives to creating ice that's so perfect, you'll never notice it at all.", "keywords": ["thats", "long", "ice", "olympics", "create", "little", "skating", "track", "warmer", "perfect", "meisters", "known", "experts", "surfaces", "good", "speedskating", "theyre", "olympic"], "polarity": 0.2021442255062945, "subjectivity": 0.5434044882320744},

There, a 15-year-old is accused of killing two classmates and wounding 18 others. Kentucky's Republican governor and legislature say they won't consider any new gun control measures. In fact, one bill on the table would let teachers and staff carry guns on campus. Kentucky Public Radio's Ryland Barton reports.\n\nRYLAND BARTON, BYLINE: Republican State Senator Steve West admits his bill isn't going to stop all school shootings, but he hopes it'll help.\n\nSTEVE WEST: It increases that kid's chances of surviving. And if there is someone there with a weapon, they will be able to take down the assailant or at least calm the situation.\n\nBARTON: Under Senate Bill 103, public school boards and private schools would be able to tap teachers or staff to be school marshals. Marshals would have to get a concealed carry permit to carry a gun on campus. In Kentucky, concealed carry classes teach basic firearm mechanics and safety but don't train participants for active shooter situations, which is the only circumstance the bill would allow school staff to use the guns. The weapons would be stored in a lockbox somewhere on school property at all other times.\n\nWEST: I wish honestly that I didn't have to file this bill, and - or we weren't even having this discussion and that we could go back in time. But unfortunately we live in 2018.\n\nBARTON: The shooting at Marshall County High School in Benton, Ky., took place after the 20th anniversary of one at Heath High School in nearby Paducah. Back then, Hollan Holm was shot in the head when a student opened fire on a group of praying classmates. During a rally at the state capitol in Frankfort, Holm said arming teachers won't stop school shootings.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nHOLLAN HOLM: In the wake of Marshall County, members of the General Assembly seek to put more guns in more hands of people with less oversight. This is not a solution that would have saved lives at Heath High School. It would not have saved lives at Marshall County High School\n\nBARTON: According to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, eight states either allow concealed carry of firearms at K-12 schools or have no laws prohibiting them. West says he's still trying to refine the bill and considering other training requirements for the marshals.\n\nWEST: Fifty states truly are experiment stations for this subject. Everybody's trying to grapple with it at the same time, and the Florida situation just enhances it even more.\n\nBARTON: State Senator Danny Carroll, a Republican whose district includes Marshall County, says he's concerned about teachers using live ammunition in active shooter situations. He's proposed a bill that would allow teachers and staff to use non-lethal weapons that would be stored on campus.\n\nDANNY CARROLL: We're talking about bean bag shotguns, shotguns that shoot rubber pellets, rubber bullets that are shot out of a pistol or a rifle, tranquilizer guns, the flash-bang devices that you often see on TV when SWAT teams make an entrance into a house.\n\nBARTON: Many Kentucky schools already have school resource officers, often off-duty and armed police officers charged with protecting students. There was an armed guard at Parkland High School in Florida just as there was last month at Marshall County High School. Neither took down their shooter. In Kentucky, the guard did report the incident. For NPR News, I'm Ryland Barton in Frankfort, Ky.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 NPR. All rights reserved.
