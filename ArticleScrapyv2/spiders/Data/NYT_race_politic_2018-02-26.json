She was a Fox News contributor from 2014 to 2016 and an early supporter of President Trump. Her endorsements of Republican candidates drew significant attention, and backlash, in part because she is a black woman.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

In a series of emails, she copied a lawyer from the New York-based law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison and wrote, \u201cThere have been a number of unfair and untrue statements about me and I am reserving all rights.\u201d\n\nMs. Winston Wolkoff made her name planning society galas in New York, including the Costume Institute Gala, also known as the Met Gala, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Over the years, she worked closely on the gala with the Vogue editor Anna Wintour. Mr. Monn also worked on the gala, which embodies an exclusive vibe that is in many ways incongruous with the messaging to blue-collar voters that Mr. Trump projected during the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nThat discordance attracted notice when Ms. Winston Wolkoff was retained by the inaugural committee, which was led by the California real estate investor Thomas J. Barrack Jr., a longtime friend of Mr. Trump\u2019s.\n\nMrs. Trump had introduced Ms. Winston Wolkoff to Mr. Barrack, according to a person familiar with the connection. But the decision to hire Ms. Winston Wolkoff was Mr. Barrack\u2019s, said an operative who worked with the inaugural committee.\n\nMs. Winston Wolkoff often invoked her friendship with Mrs. Trump when talking with officials on the Trump transition team and then in the East Wing, according to three people with direct knowledge of her interactions.\n\nThe inaugural committee promised that the swearing-in ceremonies and events would be \u201cworkmanlike,\u201d even as it raised a record-shattering $107 million \u2014 about twice as much as former President Barack Obama\u2019s inaugural committee raised for the festivities around his 2009 swearing-in \u2014 largely from wealthy donors and corporations.\n\nThe majority of those funds \u2014 more than $57 million \u2014 went to four event-planning companies. The company that received the biggest payment was Ms. Winston Wolkoff\u2019s firm, which was incorporated in California in December 2016 \u2014 about six weeks before the inauguration.\n\nThe operative who worked with the inaugural committee said that Ms. Winston Wolkoff\u2019s firm handled everything from securing venues and table settings to arranging Instagram filters and satellite feeds, as well as the transportation of heavy equipment.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAn inaugural committee official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to discuss the details publicly, said Ms. Winston Wolkoff\u2019s firm also paid the team used by Mark Burnett, the creator of \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d whose involvement in the inaugural festivities was requested by Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Barrack had praised Ms. Winston Wolkoff, saying that she \u201cexecuted her duties well.\u201d\n\nMr. Monn\u2019s $3.7 million payment from the inaugural committee was primarily to plan two events, one of which was billed as a \u201ccandlelight dinner\u201d attended by Mr. and Mrs. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence and his wife, Karen, according to the operative who worked with the committee.\n\nMr. Monn, who had planned a state dinner for Mr. Obama\u2019s White House, said he was \u201cflattered\u201d and \u201chonored\u201d when Ms. Winston Wolkoff asked him to help with the inauguration.

President Trump, stung by the defeat of Roy S. Moore last year in Alabama, has already conveyed his support to Mr. Wicker and has little appetite to risk another Senate seat in the Deep South.

A company, like a fast-food corporation, that is deemed a joint employer of workers at a franchisee can be held liable for violations of their labor rights \u2014 such as illegally firing workers involved in an organizing campaign \u2014 and can be required to bargain with them if they unionize.\n\nBefore 2015, a company could be considered a joint employer under federal labor law only if it exercised direct and immediate control over workers at the franchise.\n\nBut in a case known as Browning-Ferris, the board ruled that the parent company could be deemed a joint employer even if the control it exerted was indirect \u2014 for example, if it forced the franchisee to use software that committed it to certain scheduling practices. The board ruled that the parent company could also be considered a joint employer if the company had the right to exercise control over a franchisee that it did not exercise in practice.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

A parent company that terminates a franchise agreement to avoid doing business with a franchisee whose workers are trying to unionize may face legal liability for doing so if it is considered a joint employer.\n\nIn December, the board, with its new Republican majority, took up a case known as Hy-Brand and voted to revert to the pre-2015 standard requiring direct and immediate control.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut that case did not raise any questions that hinged on what standard to apply \u2014 the Obama-era guidelines or the previous ones. Partly as a result, the inspector general argued in his report, it was simply a pretext for relitigating Browning-Ferris.\n\n\u201cThe practical effect of the Hy-Brand deliberative process was a \u2018do-over\u2019 for the Browning-Ferris parties,\u201d the inspector general stated.\n\nThis created the potential conflict for Mr. Emanuel, whose former law firm had represented a party in the Browning-Ferris case. If the more recent case was simply a do-over for the previous case, the inspector general argued, then Mr. Emanuel should have recused himself.\n\nMs. Liebman, the former chairwoman, said the board would presumably be able to try again. But she said it would have to wait for a case raising its own questions about which joint-employer doctrine is correct, rather than simply use any vaguely related case as a pretext for revisiting the Obama-era decision.\n\n\u201cIn some future case, where the issue actually arises and some party is seeking a reversal of Browning-Ferris, where more of a deliberation goes on, that could be another vehicle,\u201d she said, adding that there was less likely to be a conflict for Mr. Emanuel in that instance. \u201cThis is likely just a reprieve.\u201d\n\nFor their part, business groups frustrated with the frequently shifting joint-employer definition argued that it was yet another reason for Congress to settle the issue with legislation.\n\n\u201cThis throws the whole situation back into question for a potentially extended period,\u201d said Matthew Haller, a senior vice president at the International Franchise Association. \u201cOur focus has been \u2014 and remains \u2014 on the need for Congress to provide legislative certainty.\u201d\n\nMr. Haller added that the House had passed such legislation in November and that it was now all the more urgent for the Senate \u201cto step into the breach.\u201d", "keywords": ["workers", "joint", "company", "board", "franchisee", "labor", "intact", "leaves", "case", "mr", "rule", "browningferris", "standard", "boards", "employer", "obamaera", "doover"], "polarity": 0.07975503332646187, "subjectivity": 0.40048100048100055},

They added that a decision against the unions would require overruling a 40-year-old precedent, striking down more than 20 state laws, creating confusion about thousands of union contracts and disrupting the lives of millions of workers.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that we have ever overruled a case where reliance interests are remotely as strong as they are here,\u201d Justice Elena Kagan said.\n\nA decision overruling the precedent would conclude a decades-long political and legal campaign by conservative groups aimed at weakening public-sector unions. Those unions stand to lose fees from workers who object to the positions the unions take and from those who simply choose not to join while benefiting from the unions\u2019 efforts on their behalf.\n\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg reflected on the consequences of ruling against the union in the case before the court. \u201cIt drains it of resources that make it an equal partner\u201d with the government in negotiations, she told William L. Messenger, a lawyer for Mark Janus, an Illinois child support specialist who objected to positions taken by his union in negotiations. \u201cAnd then you\u2019ll have a union with diminished resources, not able to investigate what it should demand at the bargaining table, not equal to the employer that it faces.\u201d\n\nNear the end of the argument, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the case represented an existential threat to the labor movement. \u201cYou\u2019re basically arguing, \u2018Do away with unions,\u2019 \u201d she told Mr. Messenger.\n\nThe case was a challenge to an Illinois law that requires government workers who choose not to join unions to \u201cpay their proportionate share of the costs of the collective bargaining process, contract administration and pursuing matters affecting wages, hours and other conditions of employment.\u201d More than 20 states have similar laws.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Detroit Board of Education, a foundational 1977 decision that made a distinction between two kinds of compelled payments. Forcing nonmembers to pay for a union\u2019s political activities violated the First Amendment, the court said. But it was constitutional, the court added, to require nonmembers to help pay for the union\u2019s collective bargaining efforts to prevent freeloading and ensure \u201clabor peace.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nConservative groups have long urged the court to overrule the Abood decision, and they have repeatedly gotten close to their goal. In 2014, the court stopped just short of overruling the decision.\n\nWhen the court revisited the issue in 2016, the Obama administration argued in favor of the unions. The Trump administration switched sides in the new case, prompting a comment from Justice Sotomayor to Solicitor General Noel J. Francisco.\n\n\u201cThis is such a radical new position on your part,\u201d she said.\n\nJustice Kagan noted that the administration\u2019s position could open the federal government to First Amendment challenges in various kinds of workplace disputes. \u201cIt strikes me as a very unusual position for the government to be taking,\u201d Justice Kagan said, perhaps reflecting on her own experience in representing the government as solicitor general in the Obama administration.\n\nJustice Anthony M. Kennedy, who is the court\u2019s most ardent supporter of broad First Amendment rights, made clear that he had no patience with mandatory fees, calling them \u201ccompelled subsidization of a private party, a private party that expresses political views constantly.\u201d\n\nThe lawyers in the case gave varying answers to questions about what would happen if the mandatory fees were eliminated. \u201cWhen these kinds of obligations of financial support become voluntary, union membership goes down, union density rates go down, union resources go down,\u201d said David L. Franklin, Illinois\u2019s solicitor general, who argued in support of the union.\n\n\u201cWhen unions are deprived of agency fees, they tend to become more militant, more confrontational,\u201d he added. \u201cThey go out in search of short-term gains that they can bring back to their members and say, \u2018Stick with us.\u2019\u201d\n\nChief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said there were arguments on the other side.\n\n\u201cThe need to attract voluntary payments will make the unions more efficient, more effective, more attractive to a broader group of their employees,\u201d the chief justice said.\n\nDavid C. Frederick, a lawyer for the union, said it should be free to fight for higher wages. \u201cMost public servants are underpaid,\u201d he said, \u201cand I will stipulate to that before this body.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat elicited a smile from Chief Justice Roberts, who was a successful lawyer in private practice and took a big pay cut when he became a judge.", "keywords": ["solicitor", "court", "decision", "fees", "justice", "case", "pay", "support", "silent", "voice", "supreme", "key", "union", "unions"], "polarity": 0.16402916924345495, "subjectivity": 0.4093186971758401},

McFaul, a political scientist and diplomat who, before serving as the American ambassador in Moscow from 2012 to 2014, wrote extensively on building democracies.\n\n\u201cNobody is making that argument today,\u201d he added, \u201ccertainly not Trump.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s administration on Monday brushed off questions about Mr. Xi\u2019s move. \u201cI believe that\u2019s a decision for China to make about what\u2019s best for their country,\u201d said Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary. \u201cBut as you know, the president\u2019s talked about term limits in a number of capacities during the campaign. It\u2019s something that he supports here in the United States, but that\u2019s a decision that would be up to China.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAlmost no one would have described China as genuinely democratic before the latest move, which was announced without fanfare on Sunday; the country remains a one-party state with extensive control over political, social and economic life.\n\nEven so, Mr. Xi\u2019s gambit ended a period of collective and term-limited leadership begun by Jiang Zemin, who held the same post as Mr. Xi from 1993 to 2003, that many had hoped was leading China toward greater rule of law and openness. This shift confirms a growing view that those expectations were probably na\u00efve, some say.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re deluded in our conviction that everybody is going to become a democracy like us,\u201d said Merriden Varrall, the director of the East Asia Program at the Lowy Institute in Australia.\n\nMr. Xi, who will be 69 when his second five-year term ends in 2023, is not simply following the example set by Mr. Putin or other leaders, she and other experts said. His motivations are unique to Chinese history and politics. Yet, they are deeply shaped by the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and collapse of the Soviet Union two years later.\n\nStrongman on the Rise\n\nThose historical milestones ushered in an era of expanding political and economic freedoms. Mr. McFaul said that for nearly a quarter of a century autocratic leaders \u201chad to play defense\u201d against the democratizing trend that seized the post-Cold War order.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEven the Russia that emerged from the ruins of the Soviet Union adopted a democratic constitution and instituted free elections. Whatever the chaos of Boris N. Yeltsin\u2019s era in the 1990s, democracy was taking root when Mr. Putin came to power \u2014 in a relatively free and fair election, no less.\n\nThe rumination of Francis Fukuyama, the scholar, has come up repeatedly. In a famous essay titled \u201cThe End of History?\u201d (note the question mark), he argued that Western liberal democracy had become recognized as \u201cthe final form of human government.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe end of history is no more,\u201d Brad W. Setser, a Treasury official during the Obama administration who is now at the Council on Foreign Relations, wrote in a message after news emerged of Mr. Xi\u2019s move.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn hindsight, Mr. Putin was the vanguard of what Mr. McFaul called the \u201cilliberal international,\u201d a new version of the Communist International founded by Lenin to spread communism around the world.\n\nAuthoritarian leaders now act with greater impunity \u2014 or at least less worry about international isolation. Aspiring authoritarians like Viktor Orban of Hungary in turn seem enticed by the kind of power Mr. Putin and Mr. Xi wield, untroubled by the need to compromise or consult or, in the case of corruption and cronyism, to answer for evidence of misrule and malfeasance.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s critics say that while he may not yet have eroded democracy in the United States, his populist appeals and nativist policies, his palpable aversion to the news media and traditional checks on power, and his stated admiration for some of the strongest of strongmen are cut from the same cloth.\n\nThe trend toward authoritarianism, while specific to each country\u2019s history, is rooted in insecurities and fears afflicting the world today: globalization and rising inequality, the stunning and scary advances in technology, the disorienting chaos and extreme violence of civil wars like Syria\u2019s, separatism and terror.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe institutions of the post-Cold War \u2014 which reflected the bedrock values of Western liberalism \u2014 no longer seem able to cope. Countries that once were beacons for others are consumed by the same anxiety and weakness, and internal strife.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Putin has long cited such flaws to shore up his power at home; the campaign to interfere in the 2016 presidential election in the United States seemed intended, in the first place, to discredit American democracy still more.\n\n\u201cLiberal democracies in the United States and even in Europe no longer look like such an inspiring model for others to follow,\u201d said Mr. McFaul, whose book on his experience shepherding Russian policy in the Obama administration, \u201cFrom Cold War to Hot Peace: An American Ambassador in Putin\u2019s Russia,\u201d will be published in May.\n\nFrom China\u2019s perspective, the end of the Cold War was hardly an inspiration, having led to the toppling of one-party dictatorships. The \u201ccontagion\u201d of 1989, which saw popular protesters bring down Communist governments in Central and Eastern Europe, infected China, too. A few months before the Berlin Wall came down, Chinese students massing in Tiananmen Square posed what officials in Beijing viewed as an existential threat, a legacy that continues to color everything the government does to this day.\n\n\u201cIf anything gives Xi Jinping and the party nightmares, it is perestroika and the fall of the Soviet Union,\u201d Ms. Varrall said, referring to the reforms the last Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, sought before the system unraveled.\n\nMr. Xi, as a result, believes that only stability can ensure his vision of China\u2019s revival and emergence as the world\u2019s power. \u201cHe seems to genuinely believe that he\u2019s the only person who can achieve this vision,\u201d she said. In last fall\u2019s Communist Party congress, Mr. Xi even presented China as a new model for the developing world \u2014 a thinly veiled argument that the United States and Europe were no longer as attractive as they once were.\n\nThe need for a strong grip appears to be a long-held conviction of Mr. Xi\u2019s. According to a 2009 diplomatic cable disclosed by WikiLeaks, an old associate told the American ambassador in Beijing at the time, Jon M. Huntsman Jr., that as a son of one of China\u2019s communist revolutionary leaders, Mr. Xi was an elitist who believed deeply in the unwavering authority of the party.\n\n\u201cOne cannot entirely escape one\u2019s past,\u201d the associate said. \u201cXi does not want to.\u201d", "keywords": ["xi", "power", "democracy", "war", "xis", "grab", "joins", "era", "mr", "states", "strongmen", "putin", "united", "china"], "polarity": 0.08249439685609898, "subjectivity": 0.3926414601946517},

As a first step, the State Department said, the consulate in the Arnona neighborhood would carve out some office space for Ambassador David M. Friedman and a small staff.\n\nBy the end of next year, the compound is to be expanded to include an interim embassy annex providing more office space for the ambassador and his team. Mr. Friedman is expected to commute from his seaside residence in Herzliyya, north of Tel Aviv, until a secure residence can be found in Jerusalem.\n\nA search is underway for a site for a permanent embassy to be built, but for the foreseeable future, the face of the United States government will be in Arnona.\n\nVideo\n\nThe consulate there, which opened in 2010, is the newest and most secure United States facility in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, according to a State Department official. The official added that there was no change to the mandate of the consulate, which engages in a wide range of political, economic, cultural, and educational contacts in the West Bank and Gaza, as well as in Jerusalem, and also serves American citizens.\n\nLife in Arnona seemed to be continuing quietly Sunday morning. Across the street from the consulate, Naomi Elook, 63, an Israel cosmetician, runs a small beauty salon in the basement of the apartment building where she has lived for 30 years. A young Muslim woman in a flowered head scarf was waiting for a treatment, and Ms. Elook said that 80 percent of her clients were Palestinians from East Jerusalem.\n\n\u201cI am happy about the embassy move,\u201d she said. \u201cIt will enrich the neighborhood and bring more security.\u201d\n\nThe Arnona compound sits between the predominantly Jewish West Jerusalem and East Jerusalem, which Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967 war and then annexed in a move that was never internationally recognized. But the compound has always been in Israel\u2019s possession and so is not, experts say, considered occupied territory.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThere are infinite ways in which the embassy move is horrible, counterproductive, destructive,\u201d said Daniel Seidemann, an Israeli attorney who specializes in Jerusalem affairs. \u201cBut the site is not the problem.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

(American officials also said on Friday that Sheldon G. Adelson, an American known for his hawkish support of Israel, had offered to help pay for the new embassy building.)\n\nThe Palestinians issued more condemnations. \u201cThe United States has become part of the problem and not the solution,\u201d Husam Zomlot, who leads the Palestinian delegation to Washington, told Voice of Palestine Radio.\n\nThe United States may have the anniversary of Israel\u2019s founding in mind as it times the embassy relocation, but the Palestinians view things through a different lens.

They argue that rewriting those terms would break the bargain they struck, not only with Iran but also with Russia and China, two other signatories. And breaching the deal, they say, would free Iran to pursue nuclear weapons again.\n\nThe upcoming talks are being led by Brian H. Hook, a low-key Republican lawyer who is the State Department\u2019s director of policy planning, who has said he would bring the European request for a guarantee back to Washington. European diplomats said they worry that Mr. Trump\u2019s scorn for the deal runs so deep that he would find other reasons to pull out. Last month, he warned that the accord \u201cis under continuous review, and our participation can be canceled by me as president at any time.\u201d\n\nEven if Mr. Trump did pledge to abide by the deal, it is far from clear that a successor deal would be endorsed by Russia or China, let alone the Iranians, who signaled in recent weeks that they are planning a new project \u2014 a fleet of nuclear-powered ships, fueled by Iranian-made reactors \u2014 that they say would justify resuming the production of nuclear fuel as the limits imposed by the deal expire over the next dozen years.\n\nStill, the mere fact that the United States and Europe are trying to work out a compromise attests to the desire, on both sides, to find a solution that would satisfy Mr. Trump while not unraveling the deal.\n\nThe president\u2019s national security team \u2014 Mr. Tillerson, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, and the national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster \u2014 has on three occasions talked him out of ripping up the deal. With each deadline to reimpose sanctions on Iran, that task gets harder.\n\nThere is an element of diplomatic legerdemain to the exercise, European diplomats acknowledge: How do you convince Mr. Trump that you have changed the deal without actually changing it?\n\n\u201cThe supplemental deal is a diplomatic device that is being used to allow the Europeans to declare victory,\u201d said Mark Dubowitz, a leading critic of the Iran deal who is nevertheless open to the idea.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThey can say they were able to keep the deal, remain steadfast to their commitment not to renegotiate it, but also to satisfy the U.S. and their own concerns that the length of the deal was too short,\u201d said Mr. Dubowitz, the chief executive of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.\n\nBy law, Mr. Trump must decide every 120 days whether to continue suspending longstanding American economic sanctions against Tehran, which the United States committed to lift as part of the deal. If he were to reimpose them, as he has threatened, that would effectively scuttle the deal.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But they could provide a pretext for Iran to resume uranium enrichment.\n\nThe Europeans are most comfortable with enforcing new limits on Iran\u2019s intercontinental ballistic missile development and testing. Missiles are not covered by the nuclear accord, but rather by a United Nations resolution, whose wording was negotiated by then-Secretary of State John Kerry just as the nuclear accord was coming together in Vienna in July 2015.\n\nThe State Department\u2019s talking points said the United States viewed the nuclear and missile programs as \u201cinseparable,\u201d and said that \u201cIran\u2019s development and testing of missiles should be subject to severe sanctions.\u201d The Europeans have not gone that far, at least yet.\n\nInspections are potentially more problematic, given the administration\u2019s rejection of arguments by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps that all military-related sites are off limits to international inspectors.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut this has not been an issue yet: The inspections have been limited to declared nuclear sites, and the United Nations nuclear agency affirmed last week that it had been given all the access it sought. Inspectors have said they would try to inspect military sites only if they had intelligence suggesting that surreptitious nuclear activity was underway.\n\nOnce a deal is struck with the Europeans, administration officials intend to seek approval from Russia, China and Iran. But concerns that such a deal could not possibly pass muster with Iran will not deter them, a senior official said. Russia and China\u2019s lack of participation would also matter little, given the stark consequences for Iran\u2019s economy if Europe and the United States reimpose sanctions, this person said.\n\nWhile American and European negotiators are working feverishly on a deal to preserve the 2015 accord, there are also preliminary discussions about what will happen if they fall short.\n\nReimposing sanctions, such as blacklisting the Central Bank of Iran, would cause serious problems for European companies, potentially precipitating a split in the trans-Atlantic alliance. But the president, Mr. Dubowitz noted, has the authority to phase in sanctions, which he could use as leverage to give negotiators more time to work out an agreement.\n\nHe could, for example, impose sanctions on the central bank for its support of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, which is accused of supporting terrorism, but waive the imposition of so-called secondary sanctions on foreign companies that do business with the bank until the next deadline in July.\n\nFor the Europeans, who are mostly satisfied with the deal and face no domestic political pressure to pull out, there is little joy in this exercise. But they feel they have no choice but to go along with it.

Patriotism and respect for the military is so high in this country that we have lately held a national debate over whether professional athletes should be required to stand for the national anthem. Men and women in uniform are given preference in boarding airplanes, and are so routinely thanked for their service that the expression has become rote. Each new season brings a crop of movies and glossy TV serials dramatizing the heroics of our Special Operations.\n\nYoung sees hollowness and potential harm in this.\n\n\u201cEnforcing the idea that every service member is a hero is dangerous,\u201d he writes. \u201cLike creating a generation of veterans who believe everything they did was good.\u201d Young warns of \u201ccreating an army of fanatics.\u201d\n\nService deserves respect, of course, but it does not in itself guarantee stirring and selfless acts of bravery. Young is his own case in point. He sees his experience \u2014 three tours in Iraq \u2014 as far from heroic. He is at least as disturbed by his duty as he is proud of it. These contradictory feelings are a central theme in his book. Years removed, he both loathes and pines for the man he became in the Marine Corps. What he calls his \u201cPast-me\u201d was a reckless, selfish, cruel and dangerous man.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe infantrymen are called grunts and crunchies,\u201d he writes. \u201cThey are stupid and intelligent and cruel and beautiful and black and white and brown and yellow and fat and lazy and lithe and godlike and frightening in their dedication to death.\u201d\n\nIt is useful for many reasons to better understand the teenagers we uniform and train and send to war.

None of the simulations favored Republicans by anywhere near as much as the congressional map enacted in 2011, which gave the Republicans a 13-to-5 advantage. And partly on that basis, the court ruled that the map violated the state\u2019s constitution.\n\nBut what about the remedial map recently adopted by the court? It is not an outlier to the same extent as the Republican-drawn map. But if you look at what 2016 statewide results would have been with the new map, the overall Democratic performance arguably would have been better than in all 500 of Mr. Chen\u2019s simulations, according to an Upshot analysis.\n\nOne common measure of a congressional map is to look at the result of the median congressional district in the average statewide election (here, the five contests in 2016). The larger the gap between the median and the average statewide popular vote, the harder it is to win a majority of seats despite winning the popular vote. By that measure, the new map was better for the Democrats than all 500 of Mr. Chen\u2019s simulations.\n\nAnother measure is simply how many districts the Democrats would have won in various statewide contests (here, the average of how many contests were won across the same five contests). Only one simulation was better for Democrats.\n\nThe strong Democratic showing compared with Mr. Chen\u2019s simulations doesn\u2019t necessarily indicate that the map is a Democratic gerrymander. For one, the simulations aren\u2019t perfect. And they aren\u2019t necessarily representative of realistic partisan-blind maps. To take a concrete example: The simulations often split the city of Pittsburgh, something few human map-drawers would choose to do given the requirement to avoid unnecessarily splitting municipalities.\n\nPerhaps more important, the remedial map still slightly favors the Republicans with respect to the statewide popular vote.\n\nIn the average 2016 contest on the new map, Democrats would have carried an average of 8.4 districts (out of 18), even though Democrats won the statewide popular vote in the average contest. The median congressional district favored the Republicans by a point in the average 2016 contest.\n\nOver all, the new court-ordered map comes very close to achieving partisan symmetry in an evenly divided state.\n\nThe seeming contradiction between the analysis based on partisan symmetry and one based on simulated nonpartisan congressional districts gets at the heart of what may be the next big debate in gerrymandering: whether nonpartisan maps should strive for partisan symmetry, or whether they should try to avoid political considerations altogether.\n\nThe question is important because both methods of analysis are routinely employed to identify Republican gerrymanders.\n\nAnd it is likely to continue to be a question, because it emerges when Democrats are at a geographic disadvantage, as they often tend to be. Just look at Pennsylvania. Democrats waste more votes than Republicans by carrying urban areas, like Pittsburgh or Philadelphia, by more lopsided margins than the Republicans carry their best areas. The result is that the rest of the state, and therefore the rest of its districts, tend to favor Republicans.\n\nIf one believes that partisan symmetry should be a goal in redistricting, the new map is eminently fair. It gives both parties a similar chance to translate their votes to seats, and makes no compromises to do so; it still admirably adheres to standard nonpartisan criteria like compactness or minimizing county splits.\n\nThe Upshot analysis also helps address a more arcane matter in the debate about the new court-ordered map: why many nonpartisan analysts thought it favored Democrats, even though it seemed to score well \u2014 it wasn\u2019t an outlier \u2014 by the measure of Mr. Chen\u2019s analysis. The reason is simple: Most nonpartisan analysts have judged the map by today\u2019s electoral landscape, while Mr. Chen\u2019s analysis used elections from 2008 and 2010.\n\nBack then, Pennsylvania\u2019s political geography did not pose such a severe challenge to Democrats. But since then, the Democrats\u2019 geographic disadvantage has worsened. State and national Democrats lost ground in traditionally Democratic areas in western and northeastern Pennsylvania where the party still excelled as late as 2008 and 2010; they gained additional ground in many urban and suburban areas where Democrats already had an advantage. As a result, Mr. Chen\u2019s simulations imply that Democrats were at a notable geographic disadvantage in 2016, but not 2008 or 2010.\n\nWhatever the limitations of these simulations, the fact remains that the court seemed to find this sort of analysis persuasive. The strong Democratic performance on the remedial map adopted last week may imply that the map was drawn with consideration for attaining partisan symmetry, and perhaps even specifically by the measure of average Democratic performance in 2016 statewide elections.\n\nNate Cohn is a domestic correspondent for The Upshot.

{"title": "\n                    How Long Can John Kelly Hang On?                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/26/magazine/how-long-can-john-kelly-hang-on.html", "text": "For most of his 67 years, Kelly, a retired four-star Marine general who projects the weary asceticism of a TV cop perpetually two weeks from retirement, might have been out of place among Mar-a-Lago\u2019s bronzed faces and gilded trimmings. But by mid-February, this was one of the few rooms where he could still expect such a warm reception. Back in Washington, the scandal surrounding his handling of abuse claims against a top aide, Rob Porter, hummed through its second week \u2014 an unusual longevity in a White House where news of a Trump lawyer\u2019s pre-election hush payment to a porn star had come and gone without great consequence. More surprising still was how quickly, and unshakably, the crisis attached itself to Kelly, whose sins \u2014 praising the aide too forcefully before his departure, purportedly sitting on the allegations for months without acting \u2014 felt airlifted from an era of more traditional Washington cover-ups. Kelly held onto his job through the weekend, which did not initially seem like a given. But Trump had already been musing privately about possible replacements.\n\nEven among Trump critics, Kelly once inspired uncommon sympathy. While other high-level officials, like Jeff Sessions and Rex Tillerson, had invited doubts about how long they could possibly tolerate working in the administration, Kelly\u2019s responsibilities seemed uniquely masochistic: He was the chief disciplinarian in a famously undisciplined White House. \u201cYou never run into somebody like Trump in the military,\u201d Panetta told me. \u201cThey\u2019d usually get kicked out.\u201d The job itself was premised on a paradox: If Trump weren\u2019t Trump, Kelly\u2019s position would be bearable. And if Trump weren\u2019t Trump, you would not need a John Kelly.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNow, Kelly\u2019s struggle has grown lonelier \u2014 informed, even before the Porter affair, by yawning cracks in his once-broad base of support. Some of Trump\u2019s deepest skeptics had convinced themselves, despite a career\u2019s worth of counterevidence, that a well-traveled military man might temper the president\u2019s instincts, particularly on immigration. Then there were Kelly\u2019s friends, who had already worried that the job was bending Kelly to its will, and not the other way around.\n\nShortly after Election Day, Senator Tom Cotton, the Arkansas Republican, went to Trump Tower to see the president-elect. Trump was preparing to staff his cabinet, and he asked Cotton, an Iraq war veteran, to name the best general of this generation. Cotton chose Kelly. \u201cThe president didn\u2019t know about General Kelly and asked me to tell him more,\u201d Cotton told me. In December, Trump nominated Kelly to run the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nUnlike many prospective additions to the administration, Kelly had stayed out of the 2016 campaign. In an interview with Foreign Policy that July, he said he would be willing to serve in either a Trump or a Clinton administration but made plain his distaste for the \u201ccesspool of domestic politics.\u201d \u201cTo join in the political fray, I don\u2019t think it convinces anyone,\u201d he said, chiding fellow military leaders who had lined up behind candidates. \u201cIt just becomes a talking point on CNN.\u201d\n\nHis confirmation process was mostly incident-free, specked with the kind of John Wayne dialogue that had dazzled Trump from the start. Before Kelly\u2019s Senate hearing, an aide who helped him prepare, Blain Rethmeier, noticed the general had neglected to attach a flag pin to his lapel. \u201cBlain,\u201d Kelly told him, declining the pin, \u201cI am an American flag.\u201d He was confirmed on Inauguration Day, 88 votes to 11. \u201cA great choice,\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, said at the time.\n\nKelly grew up in Boston\u2019s Brighton section, the Catholic-school-educated son of a postal worker; fellow Marines later joked that his accent required a Boston-to-English translator. In his own telling, he was shaped by two forces in the neighborhood: men who had worn the military uniform \u2014 his father, his uncles, everyone on the block \u2014 and the ubiquitous drug use among his peers. \u201cHe would claim that growing up in South Boston, he lost most of everybody he grew up with to drugs,\u201d Adam Isacson, the director of defense oversight at the Washington Office on Latin America, told me, recalling meetings with Kelly when he led the United States Southern Command. \u201cIt was part of his persona.\u201d\n\nBy the time the Iraq war began, Kelly, by then a three-decade veteran of the corps, had become the first Marine promoted to brigadier general in an active combat zone in over half a century, according to the Marines. On Barack Obama\u2019s first trip to Iraq as the presumed Democratic nominee in July 2008, Kelly rode with him in an armored truck across Anbar Province. His career advanced rapidly during Obama\u2019s first term, and in 2012, he was named to head the Southern Command (\u201cSouthcom\u201d), charged with overseeing United States military operations in Central and South America and the Caribbean.\n\nUnder Obama, Kelly \u2014 a typically conservative Marine, friends say \u2014 was nominally tasked with steering the country toward policies he often abhorred. After officials pushed the repeal of \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell,\u201d Kelly seethed. \u201cMarines will die from this,\u201d he told colleagues at the Pentagon. (The Trump White House disputes this.) He was also a fierce defender of the status quo at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, which fell under his command, publicly criticizing efforts to close the facility and chafing at media accounts that humanized those being held there. When some detainees began a hunger strike during Obama\u2019s second term, Kelly feared that the issue was being framed too sympathetically. His charges were instructed to call the act \u201clong-term nonreligious fasting\u201d instead.\n\nBut perhaps Kelly\u2019s most instructive experiences at Southcom involved the scourge of trafficking \u2014 drugs, weapons, people. From command headquarters, just outside Miami, he tracked narcotics production in Colombia and Guatemala. At a forum in 2015, Kelly recalled meeting an official from Customs and Border Protection who oversaw some 200 miles of the Mexico-Texas line. \u201cI asked her how much cocaine she got last year. She said, proud as she could be, \u2018642 pounds,\u2019 \u201d Kelly said. \u201cThat\u2019s pocket litter to me. I got 191 metric tons last year.\u201d He also charted the rise of MS-13, an international criminal gang that had become a security threat across Central America.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nKelly seemed to see immigration almost entirely through the prism of security \u2014 paralleling Trump\u2019s campaign, which nodded to the zero-sum economic view of immigration prominent on the right for years, but dwelled far more on blood-and-guts anecdotes of violent crime by immigrants. Although Southcom\u2019s area of responsibility does not include Mexico, this did not discourage Kelly from holding forth on the country, making claims that, according to Obama-administration officials, sometimes contradicted the intelligence of Northcom, the Pentagon command covering Mexico. At the height of the Ebola scare of 2014, he suggested publicly that the disease would spark a stampede across the border, incensing White House staff members who thought he was stoking panic. \u201cIf it breaks out, it\u2019s literally, \u2018Katie, bar the door,\u2019 \u201d Kelly said. \u201cAnd there will be mass migration into the United States.\u201d\n\nAs he assumed control at Homeland Security, Kelly implied that his views on immigration were more nuanced than Trump\u2019s, infused with compassion for a region whose leaders he had come to know personally. In preconfirmation testimony, Kelly accused the United States of \u201cignoring what our drug demand does to the people of Central and South America,\u201d whose countries had devolved at times into \u201cnearly failed narco-states.\u201d He positioned himself as a moderate voice in sessions with lawmakers, casting doubt on the wisdom of a massive border wall. Speaking to a group of Democrats last year, he suggested that undocumented immigrants without a serious criminal footprint would not be enforcement priorities. \u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019m the best thing to happen to DACA recipients,\u2019 \u201d Representative Nanette Diaz Barrag\u00e1n, a California Democrat, told me.\n\nThe benefit of the doubt lasted nine days. On Jan. 29, Trump signed an executive order barring entry to the United States by residents of seven predominantly Muslim countries, inciting large protests at airports across the country \u2014 and a backlash against Democrats who had voted to confirm Kelly, whose department was left to carry out the order. Kelly told angry lawmakers that responsibility for the chaos was \u201call on me.\u201d In reality, according to an exhaustive Inspector General\u2019s report released early this year, Kelly and his team were caught almost entirely off-guard. He told investigators that \u201che had assumed that White House staff had proactively engaged Congress and other stakeholders\u201d before the order was signed, according to the report. Publicly, Kelly cheered the spirit of the measure, arguing that a federal court order blocking the ban was preventing the nation from doing \u201call that we can to weed out potential wrongdoers from these locations.\u201d Privately, he faulted the execution. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen again,\u201d he told the White House.\n\nAt the same time, Kelly was making good on a signature Trump campaign promise. Immigration officers arrested more than 140,000 people in 2017, a sharp uptick. \u201cWe questioned the fact that many of these arrests were taking place when parents were dropping off their children to go to school,\u201d Representative Nydia Vel\u00e1zquez, a Democrat from New York who met with Kelly at the time, told me. \u201cHe didn\u2019t back down.\u201d\n\nBy then, most Democrats had seen enough. \u201cHe\u2019s disappointing to me,\u201d Schumer decided by February of last year, suggesting in an interview that Kelly was probably \u201cregretting going in.\u201d\n\nKelly betrayed no second thoughts in public. He also began taking on duties that appeared to be outside his jurisdiction. When news broke that Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, worked to establish a secret communications channel with Russian diplomats during the transition, it was Kelly who defended the effort on television as \u201ca good thing.\u201d In May, addressing a private breakfast with former diplomats and foreign-policy experts, Kelly said he had suggested to Tillerson, the ever-beleaguered secretary of state, that he could \u201ctake care of Central America\u201d while Tillerson confronted first-order headaches like North Korea, according to a person in the room. (A White House spokesman disputes this account.)\n\nIt was no secret, by then, that Trump had grown disenchanted with his first chief of staff, Reince Priebus, who presided over a team consumed by squabbling factions, endless leaks and overbroad walk-in privileges for presidential face time. (During one Oval Office meeting Trump had with New York Times reporters in April, no fewer than 20 people came and went.) In an interview with The Times last December, Kelly said that he told Trump around this time that he did not believe the president \u201cwas being well served by the staff\u201d in some respects. A month and a half later, Kelly recalled, Trump called and said, \u201cI need you to be chief.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nKelly set out first to slay the meandering, oversize meetings he loathed. \u201cI see these people,\u201d he used to tell staff members at Homeland Security, after returning from the White House. \u201cI don\u2019t even know who they are or what they do.\u201d Almost immediately, he sought to institute new rules: Meetings were to be tight, targeted and surprise-free. Once, Vice President Mike Pence showed up for one unexpectedly. \u201cYou guys have the meeting,\u201d Kelly grumbled, walking off, according to a White House official who witnessed the exchange.\n\nFor decades, the White House chief of staff\u2019s mandate has been a kind of tough love \u2014 the capacity to close the door to the Oval Office and tell the president what he does not want to hear. \u201cAbove all, you are the honest broker of information,\u201d Chris Whipple, the author of \u201cThe Gatekeepers,\u201d a history of White House chiefs, told me. True to this template, Kelly clamped down on the free flow of information to Trump, who once rifled through Breitbart articles and conspiracy-stuffed printouts with impunity. Some executive riffraff was expelled altogether. \u201cHe fired me like a gentleman,\u201d says Anthony Scaramucci, who lasted 11 days as communications director and scolds anyone who suggests it was 10. Those who dared attempt an unsanctioned chat with the president could expect a Kelly follow-up: \u201cYou want to be chief of staff?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe early purges, which included the exits of the advisers Stephen K. Bannon and Sebastian Gorka, restored a measure of good will toward Kelly among Democrats. But again, Kelly\u2019s kinship with Trump on immigration was underestimated. \u201cPart of that is the Marine in him, part of that is the Irish guy in Boston who believes that in the end, you really do have to abide by the laws,\u201d Panetta, a friend of Kelly\u2019s, told me. \u201cI think that\u2019s what\u2019s coming out now.\u201d\n\nIn November, as Homeland Security was set to extend residency permits for tens of thousands of Hondurans living in the United States, Kelly made an 11th-hour plea to the department\u2019s acting secretary to reconsider the move. When the administration debated lowering the annual cap on refugees \u2014 should it stay at 110,000? Fall to 50,000, the minimum recommended by Defense and State Department officials? Land somewhere in between? \u2014 Kelly offered his take: If it were his call, he said, the number would be between zero and one. The administration settled on 45,000.\n\nEven as Kelly has driven out the most flamboyant West Wing agitators \u2014 Scaramucci, Omarosa Manigault Newman, Bannon, Gorka \u2014 it has not gone unnoticed that Stephen Miller, the 32-year-old senior policy adviser and Trump\u2019s nativist id on immigration policy since the campaign, has thrived on Kelly\u2019s watch. \u201cHe turns out to have been more hawkish than I might have expected,\u201d Mark Krikorian, the executive director of the hard-line Center for Immigration Studies, told me of Kelly. \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasant surprise.\u201d\n\nIn January, several Senate moderates believed they were close to securing Trump\u2019s support for a compromise measure protecting the young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers, in exchange for border-security funding and other policy adjustments. Trump invited some of them to a televised summit at the White House, where he told them he would approve any legislation they brought him. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say, \u2018Oh, gee, I want this, or I want that,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll be signing it.\u201d He even assured Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, that he welcomed a stand-alone bill protecting the Dreamers from deportation \u2014 anathema to the negotiating position of Republicans in Congress, some of whom rushed to dissuade him at the table.\n\nKelly sat silently through the televised session. But after about an hour, when the cameras were dismissed and the meeting began in earnest, he unburdened himself in what four attendees described as a caustic scolding. \u201cYou\u2019ve been fiddling around for years on immigration,\u201d he told lawmakers. The time had come, he said before leaving in a huff, to \u201cdo your job.\u201d Attendees were handed a document labeled \u201cMUST HAVE\u2019S,\u201d outlining the administration\u2019s demands: billions in border-wall funding, an end to \u201cextended chain migration\u201d and a move toward a \u201cmerit-based system\u201d for legal immigration. These were requirements long pushed by Kelly and Miller and likely to sink any deal with Democrats.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Trump asked, according to three people present, eyeballing the list of what were ostensibly his own policy directives. He suggested the papers were unhelpful and could be disregarded. Lawmakers left the meeting unsure if the president knew his own administration\u2019s position, or if he was even responsible for it.\n\nDays later, a bipartisan group of senators led by Dick Durbin of Illinois and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina thought again that they could sell Trump on their plans, only to be thwarted anew. This time, they did not conceal their frustrations with Kelly in particular. \u201cI don\u2019t think he was well served by his staff,\u201d Graham said of the president to reporters at the Capitol. And Kelly, he said, was \u201cpart of the staff.\u201d\n\nIn another meeting with Hispanic congressional Democrats later in January, Kelly made the case once more for a \u201cmerit-based system\u201d for legal immigration. Members reminded him what he was asking of them. \u201cHe\u2019s saying this to 25 members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus!\u201d Representative Luis Guti\u00e9rrez, an Illinois Democrat, told me. \u201cMy mom came with a fifth-grade education. Someone stood up and said to him, \u2018So you don\u2019t think we should even be here?\u2019 We\u2019re the children of those parents. And we\u2019re members of Congress.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nKelly\u2019s active role in immigration policy, Whipple told me, was highly unusual for a chief of staff, setting Kelly apart from even otherwise partisan warriors like Dick Cheney, who served as chief to Gerald Ford, and Rahm Emanuel, the first to hold the position under Obama. \u201cThis is abnormal,\u201d Whipple said. \u201cHe\u2019s been more partisan than almost any chief of staff I can think of.\u201d\n\nIt took a mass shooting and another round of Russia intrigue to elbow speculation about Kelly\u2019s job status, post-Porter scandal, temporarily out of the news. \u201cTrying to keep below the radar particularly after the Porter issue and my involvement was so inaccurately covered,\u201d Kelly told me in an email, declining an interview. But his standing has not necessarily rebounded. This fate seems to flow, in part, from the heightened initial expectations of him. But it also speaks to his shortage of allies in Trump\u2019s inner circle. Rivals, sensing a power vacuum, are wasting no time, spawning a succession of leaks and counterleaks that evoke the Priebus-era West Wing.\n\nToday Kelly holds the support of two incongruous constituencies: those who cheer him on immigration and those who assume, despite the strikes against him, that he is preventing catastrophes no one can see. But this base is shrinking. \u201cOne Donald is bad enough,\u201d Reines, one of the last Democratic holdouts, tweeted as Kelly cycled through conflicting explanations of the Porter timeline in February. \u201cWe don\u2019t need two.\u201d\n\nOlder friends have greeted recent events with a deeper despair. Some war buddies, eager to publicly support Kelly when he took the job, have begged off entirely. \u201cI\u2019d prefer not to talk anymore about him,\u201d Mark Hertling, a retired three-star general who served with Kelly in Iraq, told me, \u201cgiven what I\u2019ve seen lately.\u201d\n\nFor John Allen, a retired four-star general who has known Kelly since the late 1970s and endorsed Clinton in 2016, the first distress signal seemed to come in October. Trump had upset the widow of La David T. Johnson, an Army sergeant who was killed in an ambush in Niger, by telling her that her husband \u201cknew what he signed up for.\u201d Defending himself afterward, Trump falsely accused Obama of not contacting the families of fallen troops at all, adding (truthfully) that Obama did not call Kelly when his son First Lt. Robert Kelly was killed in Afghanistan in 2010.\n\nKelly, who had long avoided discussing his loss in detail, confirmed as much from the lectern of the White House briefing room. \u201cIt must have been enormously painful for him,\u201d Allen told me. \u201cJohn is very private in his grief.\u201d But Kelly went on to accuse Frederica Wilson, a Florida congresswoman who knew the widow and listened to Trump\u2019s phone call with her, of making self-aggrandizing remarks years earlier. A video from the time quickly proved him wrong, but Kelly never apologized. To friends who had winced often at Trump\u2019s conduct, but never Kelly\u2019s, it was agonizing to watch.\n\nIn the months since, Trump and Kelly have found new reasons to grow sick of each other. Even before the Porter maelstrom began dominating Trump\u2019s cable-news diet, the president had been smarting for weeks over Kelly\u2019s suggestion to Fox News that the president had \u201cevolved\u201d on his wall demands. Both episodes stirred latent frustrations with Kelly\u2019s imperious style, which had grated on Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s a free spirit,\u201d Roger Stone, Trump\u2019s longtime informal adviser, said of the president. \u201cNobody handles Donald Trump. Nobody manages him. He resents those who try.\u201d Trump has been floating Gary Cohn, his economic adviser, as a possible replacement.\n\nBut on immigration, Kelly\u2019s legacy, such as it is, may already be secure.

But he urged the administration to proceed cautiously, particularly with regard to allies.\n\nThe Defense Department \u201ccontinues to be concerned about the negative impact on our key allies regarding the recommended options within the reports,\u201d Mr. Mattis wrote. He urged the administration to consider tariffs targeted at specific countries and to focus on what he described as the underlying problem \u2014 Chinese overproduction.\n\nYet the United States could face a challenge in crafting trade sanctions that circumvent allies and target China. It has already imposed a variety of restrictions on Chinese aluminum and steel. But American steel and aluminum producers argue that China still harms them indirectly by routing goods through third countries, as well as depressing global prices to a level where American manufacturers cannot compete.\n\nAlthough China has promised to cut its steel and aluminum capacity, it has made only slow, modest progress. That is why some American metal makers have argued for broader protections.\n\nCanada accounted for more than half of American imports of aluminum in 2016, followed distantly by Russia and the United Arab Emirates. Canada also made up the largest share of American steel imports in 2016 \u2014 17 percent \u2014 followed by Brazil, South Korea, Mexico and Turkey. China did not rank among the top 10 suppliers of either metal.\n\n\u201cFrom a defense perspective, it makes no sense to limit imports from Canada in the future,\u201d said Alf Barrios, the chief executive of Rio Tinto Aluminum, which exports aluminum from Canada to the United States. \u201cCanada is a longstanding, reliable supply for any needs the United States might have.\u201d\n\nCanada\u2019s inclusion in the Commerce Department recommendations was unexpected, in part because companies and workers have been relatively united in calling for the country to be exempted. The operations of many metal makers \u2014 as well as the United Steelworkers, their largest union \u2014 stretch across the border. Under law, Canada is included as part of the United States defense industrial base, and the growth of its aluminum industry dates back to supporting the United States during World War II.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

Britain, Australia, Europe and Japan would also be included under the kind of blanket tariff or quota recently floated by the Commerce Department.\n\nThe measures could fall particularly hard on South Korea, which was named as one of the countries that would face a 53 percent tariff on its steel exports, along with China, Brazil, India, Russia, Turkey and six others, under one potential scenario in the report.\n\nThe United States has been seeking South Korea\u2019s cooperation to combat a nuclear threat from North Korea. But the Trump administration has simultaneously pursued the country on trade, largely because South Korea maintains a large trade surplus with the United States. The administration is renegotiating its free trade deal with South Korea, and the country was a target of an earlier tariff on washing machines.\n\nIncluding countries like Canada could lead to unintended ramifications for the United States military and economy.\n\nMany products made in America use foreign metals, including the Ford F-150, a classic American truck that is consistently ranked as one of the most \u201cmade-in-America\u201d vehicles in an industry known for sourcing parts from around the world.\n\nThe truck\u2019s engine and transmission are American-made, and the truck is assembled in plants in Dearborn, Mich., and Claycomo, Mo. Even so, the truck is made of Canadian aluminum, some of which comes from Rio Tinto\u2019s aluminum works in Quebec \u2014 an area with plentiful hydropower, which is needed for the energy-intensive process of producing aluminum.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFrom Quebec, some aluminum travels to a plant in upstate New York owned by Novelis, which combines it with recycled aluminum and rolls it out into wide sheets for Ford.\n\nAnother 15 percent of the value of the truck\u2019s components come from Mexico. Its window wipers come from a factory in Matamoros, some of its wheels from Chihuahua, and some of the pistons in its engine from Ramos Arizpe.\n\nThe auto industry says this web of North American suppliers allows it to produce cars and trucks at a quality and a price to compete with products made around the world. Ford exports the truck back to Canada, and last year it announced that it would begin exporting vehicles to China as well.\n\nEconomists say the companies that make aluminum into car bodies and soda cans employ far more people than the smelters that make raw aluminum itself. Novelis, which specializes in recycling and rolling aluminum out into sheets, announced in January that it would invest $300 million to open a new factory in Guthrie, Ky., to make the aluminum sheeting used in cars.\n\nThe same trends are true in the steel industry. In mid-February, 15 American industry associations that buy steel to make their products wrote a letter to Mr. Trump arguing that, by raising the price of steel, restrictions on imports could do more harm than good. They said they represented more than one million jobs in the United States, compared with about 80,000 jobs in primary steel production.\n\nOther economic forces are driving aluminum smelting from the United States. Aluminum manufacturing is extremely energy intensive, so it has tended to go to parts of the world with cheap excess energy, like the Middle East, Iceland and Canada. Smelters in the United States must compete with other, more profitable businesses for electricity, like computer server farms.", "keywords": ["steel", "industry", "aluminum", "aimed", "states", "trade", "ensnare", "south", "trump", "united", "china", "sanctions", "american", "canada"], "polarity": 0.07730344368275403, "subjectivity": 0.3849612073750004},

In September, that office was moved into the National Economic Council and placed under the purview of its director, Gary D. Cohn, a former Goldman Sachs investor whose more conventional views on trade have contrasted sharply with those of Mr. Navarro.\n\nThe White House said then that reorganization was part of an effort to streamline protocols in the West Wing, but it was widely viewed as sidelining the influence of Mr. Navarro, once a primary adviser to the president. With Mr. Navarro\u2019s promotion, the White House is again considering making his Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy independent from the National Economic Council.\n\nWhite House trade policy has been rocked in recent weeks by the departure of Rob Porter, a former aide accused of domestic violence, who had organized regular meetings for the trade staff. John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff who imposed order on the West Wing through a strict hierarchy that left Mr. Navarro out of high-level meetings, has also been beset by rumors that he has lost standing in the White House over a series of recent negative events.\n\nAmid the tumult, Mr. Navarro has been able to leverage a close personal relationship with the president to gain more access, a third trade expert close to the White House said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

But the biggest change for Mr. Navarro is that he may once again gain more access to top meetings \u2014 and to the president himself.\n\nMr. Navarro presided over an early period on the campaign trail and in the White House, during which President Trump appeared poised to fulfill his most aggressive promises on trade, including ripping up trade deals that he had criticized as bad for American companies and workers and imposing tariffs on imports.\n\nMr. Navarro entered the White House with multiple trade actions written and ready for the president\u2019s signature, including a directive to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement, known as Nafta. As The New York Times has previously reported, on at least three occasions in the president\u2019s first year in office, Mr. Navarro\u2019s attempts to withdraw the United States from Nafta were blocked by more pro-trade advisers, headed by Mr. Cohn.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe president did sign another directive authored by Mr. Navarro, pulling the United States out of a multinational trade deal known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership. But other efforts by Mr. Navarro to impose tariffs on steel imports and withdraw from a free-trade agreement with South Korea were blocked, leading some to question whether the president had abandoned his promise to take a more aggressive approach to trade than his predecessors.\n\nAs Mr. Kelly imposed order on the White House by limiting the president\u2019s access to some advisers, Mr. Navarro\u2019s influence was reduced. Mr. Navarro was required to copy Mr. Cohn, his new superior, on all emails. He was absent from some high-level strategy meetings on trade, as well as the president\u2019s trip to China, a focus of Mr. Navarro\u2019s.\n\nSupporters and opponents of Mr. Navarro describe this as a concerted effort by more pro-trade factions to keep the president from hearing Mr. Navarro\u2019s views, which could have goaded Mr. Trump into more aggressive action.\n\nMr. Navarro is a Ph.D. economist and a former professor at the University of California, Irvine, but some of his ideas on trade have been criticized by mainstream economists. While most economists say Nafta has benefited the United States economy on the whole, Mr. Navarro has sharply criticized the deal. He has denounced some foreign investments as \u201cconquest by purchase\u201d and argued for retracting global supply chains back within the United States\u2019 borders.\n\nFrom a nearby post in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, Mr. Navarro spent months focusing on trade measures that were less in the spotlight, including expanding provisions that require the government to buy American goods, and carrying out a government-wide review of the defense industry.\n\nIn the last few months, however, the Trump administration has ramped up its trade actions. The White House announced tariffs on washing machines and solar cells and modules in January. The administration is also on the cusp of announcing tariffs or other restrictions on imports of steel and aluminum, as well as measures to penalize China for unfair trade.\n\nIn an expanded post, Mr. Navarro may be particularly influential on combating China. Mr. Navarro has authored books including \u201cDeath by China\u201d and \u201cThe Coming China Wars,\u201d which advocated the type of aggressive trade stance toward China that is now widely echoed by officials in the Trump administration.", "keywords": ["navarros", "ascendant", "president", "trade", "mr", "navarro", "white", "china", "office", "united", "skeptic", "peter", "house"], "polarity": 0.08425676055546187, "subjectivity": 0.27828859452236077},

They have helped produce a Supreme Court that most experts expect to rule in Mr. Janus\u2019s favor.\n\nThe case illustrates the cohesiveness with which conservative philanthropists have taken on unions in recent decades. \u201cIt\u2019s a mistake to look at the Janus case and earlier litigation as isolated episodes,\u201d said Alexander Hertel-Fernandez, a Columbia University political scientist who studies conservative groups. \u201cIt\u2019s part of a multipronged, multitiered strategy.\u201d\n\nIn doing so, these donors have not just brought labor to the brink of crisis but threatened the Democratic Party as well.\n\nAmid changes in the campaign finance landscape and the decline of private-sector unions, the party and its candidates have increasingly relied on major public unions for funding, including hundreds of millions of dollars in direct and indirect spending during the 2016 presidential cycle. Those unions include the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, whose Council 31 is the defendant in the Janus case.\n\nPhoto\n\nA recent paper by Mr. Hertel-Fernandez and two colleagues may foretell what Democrats can expect if Mr. Uihlein and his fellow philanthropists succeed. It found that the Democratic share of the presidential vote dropped by an average of 3.5 percentage points after the passage of so-called right-to-work laws allowing employees to avoid paying union fees. That is larger than Democrats\u2019 margin of defeat in several states that could have reversed their last three presidential losses.\n\nAnd that is clearly on the mind of Republicans. In a recent interview, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, acknowledged the potential of the Janus case to hurt Democratic fund-raising for the coming midterm elections. \u201cIn states where they got rid of the automatic deduction and employees figured they could keep their own money, they did,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it could have an impact.\u201d\n\nConservative groups aren\u2019t alone in locking arms to advance an ideological agenda. For decades, liberal donors and foundations, sometimes working together through coalitions like the Democracy Alliance, have promoted liberal goals in a variety of ways. Some backed groups, like the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and the GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders, that used litigation to move American society leftward.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut the extent of the coordination on the right often dwarfs liberal efforts. Especially on the state level, conservative groups are \u201cdoing different things, mobilizing different constituencies,\u201d Mr. Hertel-Fernandez said. \u201cBut they\u2019re all working with one another. You don\u2019t see the same thing on the left.\u201d\n\nAs the percentage of unionized private-sector workers has collapsed in recent decades, public-sector unions, which have held steady in the mid-30s since the early 1980s, have increasingly become a target.\n\nConservatives chafe at the unions\u2019 political influence, which they believe not only props up the Democratic Party but also drives up government spending and skews public policy on issues like education.\n\nIn 2011, Wisconsin rolled back the right of most public unions to bargain over anything other than wages and eliminated the requirement that nonmembers pay fees. The portion of unionized public-sector workers in the state plummeted from half to just over one-quarter within five years.\n\nIn seeking to produce similar results nationally, conservative donors have created a symbiosis between groups aiming to overturn Supreme Court precedent favorable to unions and groups that take advantage of those rulings to drain unions of members.\n\nThe Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation of Wisconsin, which had over $800 million in assets in 2016, has funded both kinds of organizations.\n\nIn a 2014 case brought by a group that had received more than $1 million in contributions from the Bradley Foundation, the Supreme Court ruled that home-care aides and other \u201cpartial-public employees\u201d paid through Medicaid could not be forced to pay fair-share fees if they left their unions. Unions say these fees, typically about 80 percent of standard dues, are necessary to compensate them for representing nonmembers in bargaining and grievance proceedings.\n\nPhoto\n\nThen in 2016, the court heard a case, Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association, that could have struck down fair-share fee requirements for all public employees represented by unions in more than 20 states, including California, Illinois and New York. The case was brought by a group that has received millions of dollars from the Bradley Foundation.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDuring 2015 and 2016, the foundation also substantially increased its contributions, totaling well over $1 million, to groups like the Independence Institute of Colorado and the Freedom Foundation of Washington State. Those groups have used such tools as direct mail, phone calls and door knocking to persuade public-sector workers to give up union membership.\n\nRichard Graber, the chief executive of the Bradley Foundation, said the foundation avoided short-term tactical considerations in its giving. But he acknowledged that the increase was driven partly by the recent Supreme Court developments, which promised to make such opt-out campaigns more compelling for union members. (Some conservative groups are currently raising money for even more ambitious opt-out campaigns to take advantage of a favorable ruling this year.)\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

That gave the Liberty Justice Center, backed by Mr. Uihlein, a chance to try again.\n\nFew philanthropists have funded a more sweeping assault on labor than Mr. Uihlein, who with his wife, Elizabeth, founded a Wisconsin-based shipping supply company called Uline.\n\nMr. Uihlein is an ardent conservative who considers many Republican office holders too moderate on fiscal and social issues, according to those who know him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just politics for him,\u201d said his friend Leonard A. Leo, the Federalist Society executive vice president, who declined to offer specifics on Mr. Uihlein\u2019s views. \u201cI think he is philosophically attuned to conservative ideas,\u201d added Mr. Leo, whom the Trump White House enlisted to shepherd the Supreme Court nomination of Neil M. Gorsuch, Justice Scalia\u2019s successor.\n\nThe Uihleins have spent tens of millions of dollars over the past decade supporting Republican candidates and committees. That includes contributions to super PACs backing the 2016 presidential campaigns of Mr. Walker and Mr. Cruz, and at least $250,000 to help Mr. Walker survive a 2012 recall election. (Mr. Uihlein did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nThe Uihleins appear to be preoccupied with state employee pensions and the unions that negotiate them.\n\n\u201cBruce is the only one in the race who isn\u2019t beholden to public-sector unions,\u201d Mr. Uihlein said of Mr. Rauner, the year before his 2014 election as Illinois governor, in an interview with Crain\u2019s Business Chicago. The Uihleins gave more than $2.5 million to his campaign.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Rauner has been a major ally in the fight against public-sector unions. Shortly after taking office in 2015, he challenged the constitutionality of mandatory union fees in federal court.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBy the time a judge ruled that Mr. Rauner lacked standing for his lawsuit, the Illinois Policy Institute, which drew more than one-third of its $5.8 million in revenue that year from Mr. Uihlein\u2019s foundation, had found a viable plaintiff to replace him: Mark Janus. The Liberty Justice Center and the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation, which Mr. Uihlein also contributes to, represented Mr. Janus in court.\n\nSince then, the policy institute has sought to persuade state employees to leave their union through its mailing campaign. It said it had obtained employees\u2019 names through Freedom of Information Act requests.\n\nMr. Rauner\u2019s administration has amplified the institute\u2019s message, and vice versa. In an August 2016 email to state workers, the administration highlighted a benefit of giving up union membership and urged workers to visit a website that would help them do so. The policy institute soon promoted the same website and provided similar guidance in its mailings to state workers.\n\nMr. Uihlein\u2019s foundation has supplemented these efforts by supporting a nonprofit called Think Freely Media, which uses storytelling techniques to champion free-market ideas, including right-to-work laws. The Uihlein foundation contributed more than $1.5 million to Think Freely from 2014 to 2016, the last year for which tax records are available.\n\nAt the center of this network is a longtime conservative activist named John Tillman, who serves as the chief executive of the Illinois Policy Institute as well as the chairman of the Liberty Justice Center and Think Freely Media.\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Tillman, who managed a call center earlier in his career and talked up his \u201cmarketing-centric approach\u201d to promoting free enterprise, said the institute is fighting the enormous power of union leaders but is not anti-union per se.\n\n\u201cIn the late 1800s, early 20th century, business owners had all the power, and workers had very little power,\u201d he said. \u201cUnions and collective bargaining emerged as a way to level the playing field.

Mr. Kim seized on Mr. Moon\u2019s peace overtures before the Olympics to send his sister, Kim Yo-jong, to the opening ceremony and a large contingent of cheerleaders and athletes to the Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea.\n\nBut Mr. Moon also knows he must convince the Americans to give him a chance. In a sign of how hard that will be, and how deeply the United States and North Korea distrust each other, Mr. Pence, who was Washington\u2019s envoy to the opening ceremony, and Ms. Kim would not even look at each other despite being seated only a few feet apart.\n\nOn Friday, Mr. Moon argued for a South Korean-brokered peace and for the United States-North Korea talks when he met with President Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump, who arrived to attend the Games\u2019 closing ceremony. He told her he wanted to improve ties \u201cin parallel\u201d with efforts to denuclearize the North.\n\nAnalysts said that once the Olympics ended, Mr. Moon would be left to sort out how much of the North\u2019s so-called charm offensive, in which it refrained from provocations like missile tests, could last.\n\n\u201cSouth and North Korea used the Olympics to use each other,\u201d said Yoo Dong-ryul, director of the Korea Institute for Liberal Democracy in Seoul. \u201cThe South was desperate to ease tensions. The North wanted to soften its image and weaken international sanctions. Now comes the hard part for Moon, after the Olympics.\u201d\n\nWithout a solution to the nuclear issue, relations between the two Koreas \u201cwill eventually revert to the same crisis mode before the Olympics,\u201d Mr. Yoo said.\n\nPhoto\n\nSo far, Washington and Pyongyang seem unable to talk. The North Koreans, including Mr. Kim\u2019s sister, canceled a meeting with Mr. Pence in Pyeongchang after he refused to soften his criticisms of the North\u2019s weapons and human rights.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNorth Korea seeks to be accepted as a nuclear power and win economic concessions in return for not advancing its nuclear programs any further, analysts say. But the United States insists it will never enter any serious negotiations or ease sanctions until the North commits itself to nuclear disarmament.\n\nOver the weekend, Mr. Trump announced harsh new sanctions against North Korea and warned of tougher measures if the North fails to relinquish its nuclear arsenal.\n\nThe hard line out of Washington has stood in conspicuous contrast with the more conciliatory gestures from Seoul.\n\nDavid Straub, a former American diplomat who is now a fellow at the Sejong Institute in South Korea, said there were rising frustrations in Washington that Mr. Moon was \u201capparently working at cross purposes with the Trump administration\u2019s effort to apply \u2018maximum pressure\u2019 on North Korea.\u201d\n\nThis \u201ccould result in a serious clash of wills between the two allied leaders,\u201d Mr. Straub said. \u201cIf the Trump administration or the Moon administation does not change its fundamental position, the odds are increasing that relations between the two will worsen.\u201d\n\nMr. Moon, a dogged advocate of dialogue with the North, had spent the last year helplessly watching the Korean Peninsula edge toward active war, as the North test-launched intercontinental ballistic missiles and conducted its most powerful nuclear test, and Mr. Trump threatened to rain down \u201cfire and fury\u201d on North Korea.\n\nDesperate to avoid a possible military conflict, Mr. Moon seized upon the Pyeongchang Games to craft what some analysts called an \u201cOlympic truce.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The first step, according to these officials, is for the administration to settle on a more consistent message toward North Korea.\n\nThe United States has veered in recent weeks from expressing openness to diplomacy to reiterating threats of military action if the North does not curb its nuclear and missile programs. The net effect, according to analysts, has been to confuse both North and South Korea.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhite House officials will also have to decide how to react if the inter-Korean diplomacy accelerates. The Trump administration is determined not to make undue concessions to North Korea, a mistake it says both Democratic and Republican presidents have made. On the other hand, if the United States takes too hard a position, analysts said it could prompt Mr. Moon to conclude that the Americans will never come around.\n\nThat could prompt Mr. Moon to set off on his own, isolating the United States by driving away one of its most important allies in Asia, which could end up drifting closer to China.\n\n\u201cOnce the ball gets rolling, it\u2019s very hard to stop, in large part because Seoul and Beijing want talks so badly,\u201d said Evan S. Medeiros, a managing director at Eurasia Group who was a senior Asia adviser to President Barack Obama.\n\nAnalysts said Mr. Moon was trying to get that forward momentum by seizing on this chance to move the peninsula toward peace with South Korea in the driver\u2019s seat.\n\n\u201cMoon Jae-in is not a na\u00efve waif,\u201d said Gordon Flake, the chief executive of the Perth USAsia Center at the University of Western Australia. \u201cThe South Koreans are desperately seeking to change the trajectory, which was leading to a conflict, and at the same time to do that while not giving too much space between them and the United States.\u201d\n\nFor both the Trump and Moon administrations, the first big test will be what to do about joint United States-South Korean military exercises that were postponed during the Olympics and the Paralympics, which will take place from March 9 to 18.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNorth Korea has indicated that it will restart weapons tests if the drills resume, scuttling Mr. Moon\u2019s efforts to broker a peace.\n\nConservatives in both South Korea and the United States fear that anything less than the full resumption of the war games would only advance the North\u2019s ultimate goal of ridding the peninsula of the American military presence, which they say the South needs for protection.\n\nBut progressive South Koreans who support Mr. Moon would most likely see a push by Washington to resume the exercises as \u201cthrowing cold water over the South\u2019s Olympic party,\u201d and as an effort to derail Mr. Moon\u2019s push for inter-Korean rapprochement, said Lee Byong-chul, senior fellow at the Institute for Peace and Cooperation in Seoul.\n\nSouth Koreans who attended Olympic events were cautious about how much the Olympic diplomacy could accomplish.\n\nYeon Ju-lee, 21, who recently watched a joint Korean team in women\u2019s ice hockey, said she felt relieved that the North\u2019s participation in the Olympics was easing fears of possible war. But, she said, actual political unification \u201cwill take a long time.\u201d\n\nAnother spectator, Lee Hae-man, 62, said recent developments were promising \u201cbecause we are all one family together, North and South.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will feel very betrayed if Kim Jong-un goes back to missile tests,\u201d he added.", "keywords": ["lasting", "turn", "leader", "olympic", "olympics", "truce", "moon", "peace", "korea", "states", "mr", "trump", "koreas", "nuclear", "north", "united", "south"], "polarity": 0.007703070931226276, "subjectivity": 0.39912877036663447},

Over the years, she worked closely on the gala with the Vogue editor Anna Wintour. Mr. Monn also worked on the gala, which embodies an exclusive vibe that is in many ways incongruous with the messaging to blue-collar voters that Mr. Trump projected during the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nThat discordance attracted notice when Ms. Winston Wolkoff was retained by the inaugural committee, which was led by the California real estate investor Thomas J. Barrack Jr., a longtime friend of Mr. Trump\u2019s.\n\nMrs. Trump had introduced Ms. Winston Wolkoff to Mr. Barrack, according to a person familiar with the connection. But the decision to hire Ms. Winston Wolkoff was Mr. Barrack\u2019s, said an operative who worked with the inaugural committee.\n\nMs. Winston Wolkoff often invoked her friendship with Mrs. Trump when talking with officials on the Trump transition team and then in the East Wing, according to three people with direct knowledge of her interactions.\n\nThe inaugural committee promised that the swearing-in ceremonies and events would be \u201cworkmanlike,\u201d even as it raised a record-shattering $107 million \u2014 about twice as much as former President Barack Obama\u2019s inaugural committee raised for the festivities around his 2009 swearing-in \u2014 largely from wealthy donors and corporations.\n\nThe majority of those funds \u2014 more than $57 million \u2014 went to four event-planning companies. The company that received the biggest payment was Ms. Winston Wolkoff\u2019s firm, which was incorporated in California in December 2016 \u2014 about six weeks before the inauguration.\n\nThe operative who worked with the inaugural committee said that Ms. Winston Wolkoff\u2019s firm handled everything from securing venues and table settings to arranging Instagram filters and satellite feeds, as well as the transportation of heavy equipment.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAn inaugural committee official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to discuss the details publicly, said Ms. Winston Wolkoff\u2019s firm also paid the team used by Mark Burnett, the creator of \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d whose involvement in the inaugural festivities was requested by Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Barrack had praised Ms. Winston Wolkoff, saying that she \u201cexecuted her duties well.\u201d\n\nMr. Monn\u2019s $3.7 million payment from the inaugural committee was primarily to plan two events, one of which was billed as a \u201ccandlelight dinner\u201d attended by Mr. and Mrs. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence and his wife, Karen, according to the operative who worked with the committee.\n\nMr. Monn, who had planned a state dinner for Mr. Obama\u2019s White House, said he was \u201cflattered\u201d and \u201chonored\u201d when Ms. Winston Wolkoff asked him to help with the inauguration.

A company, like a fast-food corporation, that is deemed a joint employer of workers at a franchisee can be held liable for violations of their labor rights \u2014 such as illegally firing workers involved in an organizing campaign \u2014 and can be required to bargain with them if they unionize.\n\nBefore 2015, a company could be considered a joint employer under federal labor law only if it exercised direct and immediate control over workers at the franchise.\n\nBut in a case known as Browning-Ferris, the board ruled that the parent company could be deemed a joint employer even if the control it exerted was indirect \u2014 for example, if it forced the franchisee to use software that committed it to certain scheduling practices.

A parent company that terminates a franchise agreement to avoid doing business with a franchisee whose workers are trying to unionize may face legal liability for doing so if it is considered a joint employer.\n\nIn December, the board, with its new Republican majority, took up a case known as Hy-Brand and voted to revert to the pre-2015 standard requiring direct and immediate control.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut that case did not raise any questions that hinged on what standard to apply \u2014 the Obama-era guidelines or the previous ones.

If the more recent case was simply a do-over for the previous case, the inspector general argued, then Mr. Emanuel should have recused himself.\n\nMs. Liebman, the former chairwoman, said the board would presumably be able to try again. But she said it would have to wait for a case raising its own questions about which joint-employer doctrine is correct, rather than simply use any vaguely related case as a pretext for revisiting the Obama-era decision.\n\n\u201cIn some future case, where the issue actually arises and some party is seeking a reversal of Browning-Ferris, where more of a deliberation goes on, that could be another vehicle,\u201d she said, adding that there was less likely to be a conflict for Mr. Emanuel in that instance. \u201cThis is likely just a reprieve.\u201d\n\nFor their part, business groups frustrated with the frequently shifting joint-employer definition argued that it was yet another reason for Congress to settle the issue with legislation.\n\n\u201cThis throws the whole situation back into question for a potentially extended period,\u201d said Matthew Haller, a senior vice president at the International Franchise Association. \u201cOur focus has been \u2014 and remains \u2014 on the need for Congress to provide legislative certainty.\u201d\n\nMr. Haller added that the House had passed such legislation in November and that it was now all the more urgent for the Senate \u201cto step into the breach.\u201d", "keywords": ["workers", "joint", "company", "board", "franchisee", "labor", "intact", "leaves", "case", "mr", "rule", "browningferris", "standard", "boards", "employer", "obamaera", "doover"], "polarity": 0.07975503332646187, "subjectivity": 0.40048100048100055},

Discount Image A proposed tax cut in Georgia, which would primarily benefit Delta Air Lines, was in jeopardy on Monday after the state\u2019s lieutenant governor vowed to kill the legislation after the company eliminated a discount program with the National Rifle Association. Credit David Goldman/Associated Press\n\nThe lieutenant governor in Georgia threatened on Monday to kill a proposed lucrative tax cut for Delta Air Lines after the company eliminated a discount fare program for the National Rifle Association over the weekend.\n\nThe move by Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle, who presides over the State Senate, immediately put the legislation in jeopardy and put him at loggerheads with other top state officials, including the governor, who had championed the tax deal. The showdown between one of Georgia\u2019s most powerful politicians and one of the state\u2019s largest employers was the latest clash in a national debate around guns after the deadly school shooting in Florida this month.\n\nMr. Cagle, a Republican, fired the salvo at Delta on Twitter on Monday afternoon, saying that the Atlanta-based company must restore its program with the N.R.A. \u201cCorporations cannot attack conservatives and expect us not to fight back,\u201d Mr. Cagle, who had expressed his support for the bill earlier this month, said on Twitter.\n\nImage Lt.

Credit Bob Andres/Atlanta Journal-Constitution, via Associated Press\n\nMr. Cagle, who received an A+ grade by the N.R.A. when he was running for his position in 2006, did not return a call seeking comment on Monday evening. As the Senate president, Mr. Cagle wields significant influence over legislation and how it flows through the Senate, where Republicans hold a 37 to 19 majority over Democrats.\n\nA spokeswoman for Gov. Nathan Deal, who had said the tax bill was necessary to encourage airlines to open direct routes from Georgia to destinations around the world, did not return an email seeking comment.\n\nOther Republicans in the State Legislature also on Monday pulled back their support for the bill, which would grant a $50 million sales tax exemption on jet fuel, primarily benefiting Delta. Among the new critics was the House speaker, David Ralston, who said on Monday that he was disappointed with Delta and wished it had announced the decision before the House approved the tax bill on Thursday. The legislation moved the next day to the Senate, where it seemed to have broad support.\n\nBut on Saturday, that support all but evaporated after Delta announced it had eliminated a discount fare program for travelers to attend the N.R.A.\u2019s 2018 annual meeting in May. The airline, which had come under growing pressure from its customers and others to cut ties with the gun group, said its decision \u201creflects the airline\u2019s neutral status in the current national debate over gun control amid recent school shootings.\u201d\n\nDelta said in a statement on Saturday that it supported the Second Amendment but has refrained from political issues before. The airline noted that it withdrew financial support of a New York production of \u201cJulius Caesar\u201d last summer because it depicted the assassination of a Trump-like Roman ruler.\n\nIn the days after the shooting massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., more than a dozen companies, including MetLife Insurance, Symantec and Enterprise, cut ties with the N.R.A. Many were being threatened with boycotts over the deals and discounts they had offered to the gun group\u2019s members.\n\nAlso on Monday, FedEx made an unusual move by declaring its opposition to the N.R.A.\u2019s stance on gun policy and safety while saying it \u201cdoes not and will not deny service or discriminate against any legal entity regardless of their policy positions or political views.\u201d\n\nFedEx said that the N.R.A. was one of hundreds of organizations whose members receive discounts on shipping rates. It also pushed for \u201curgent action\u201d from local, state and federal politicians to prevent future mass shootings.\n\n\u201cFedEx opposes assault rifles being in the hands of civilians,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWhile we strongly support the constitutional right of U.S. citizens to own firearms subject to appropriate background checks, FedEx views assault rifles and large-capacity magazines as an inherent potential danger to schools, workplaces, and communities when such weapons are misused.\u201d\n\nOver the weekend, celebrities like Julianne Moore, Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Zach Braff posted their plans to boycott FedEx until the company stopped partnering with the N.R.A.\n\nSign up for California Today The news and stories that matter to Californians (and anyone else interested in the state), delivered weekday mornings.

Detroit Board of Education, a foundational 1977 decision that made a distinction between two kinds of compelled payments. Forcing nonmembers to pay for a union\u2019s political activities violated the First Amendment, the court said.

In 2014, the court stopped just short of overruling the decision.\n\nWhen the court revisited the issue in 2016, the Obama administration argued in favor of the unions. The Trump administration switched sides in the new case, prompting a comment from Justice Sotomayor to Solicitor General Noel J. Francisco.\n\n\u201cThis is such a radical new position on your part,\u201d she said.\n\nJustice Kagan noted that the administration\u2019s position could open the federal government to First Amendment challenges in various kinds of workplace disputes. \u201cIt strikes me as a very unusual position for the government to be taking,\u201d Justice Kagan said, perhaps reflecting on her own experience in representing the government as solicitor general in the Obama administration.\n\nJustice Anthony M. Kennedy, who is the court\u2019s most ardent supporter of broad First Amendment rights, made clear that he had no patience with mandatory fees, calling them \u201ccompelled subsidization of a private party, a private party that expresses political views constantly.\u201d\n\nThe lawyers in the case gave varying answers to questions about what would happen if the mandatory fees were eliminated. \u201cWhen these kinds of obligations of financial support become voluntary, union membership goes down, union density rates go down, union resources go down,\u201d said David L. Franklin, Illinois\u2019s solicitor general, who argued in support of the union.\n\n\u201cWhen unions are deprived of agency fees, they tend to become more militant, more confrontational,\u201d he added. \u201cThey go out in search of short-term gains that they can bring back to their members and say, \u2018Stick with us.\u2019\u201d\n\nChief Justice John G.

Whatever the chaos of Boris N. Yeltsin\u2019s era in the 1990s, democracy was taking root when Mr. Putin came to power \u2014 in a relatively free and fair election, no less.\n\nThe rumination of Francis Fukuyama, the scholar, has come up repeatedly. In a famous essay titled \u201cThe End of History?\u201d (note the question mark), he argued that Western liberal democracy had become recognized as \u201cthe final form of human government.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe end of history is no more,\u201d Brad W. Setser, a Treasury official during the Obama administration who is now at the Council on Foreign Relations, wrote in a message after news emerged of Mr. Xi\u2019s move.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn hindsight, Mr. Putin was the vanguard of what Mr. McFaul called the \u201cilliberal international,\u201d a new version of the Communist International founded by Lenin to spread communism around the world.\n\nAuthoritarian leaders now act with greater impunity \u2014 or at least less worry about international isolation. Aspiring authoritarians like Viktor Orban of Hungary in turn seem enticed by the kind of power Mr. Putin and Mr. Xi wield, untroubled by the need to compromise or consult or, in the case of corruption and cronyism, to answer for evidence of misrule and malfeasance.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s critics say that while he may not yet have eroded democracy in the United States, his populist appeals and nativist policies, his palpable aversion to the news media and traditional checks on power, and his stated admiration for some of the strongest of strongmen are cut from the same cloth.\n\nThe trend toward authoritarianism, while specific to each country\u2019s history, is rooted in insecurities and fears afflicting the world today: globalization and rising inequality, the stunning and scary advances in technology, the disorienting chaos and extreme violence of civil wars like Syria\u2019s, separatism and terror.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe institutions of the post-Cold War \u2014 which reflected the bedrock values of Western liberalism \u2014 no longer seem able to cope.

The \u201ccontagion\u201d of 1989, which saw popular protesters bring down Communist governments in Central and Eastern Europe, infected China, too. A few months before the Berlin Wall came down, Chinese students massing in Tiananmen Square posed what officials in Beijing viewed as an existential threat, a legacy that continues to color everything the government does to this day.\n\n\u201cIf anything gives Xi Jinping and the party nightmares, it is perestroika and the fall of the Soviet Union,\u201d Ms. Varrall said, referring to the reforms the last Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, sought before the system unraveled.\n\nMr. Xi, as a result, believes that only stability can ensure his vision of China\u2019s revival and emergence as the world\u2019s power. \u201cHe seems to genuinely believe that he\u2019s the only person who can achieve this vision,\u201d she said. In last fall\u2019s Communist Party congress, Mr. Xi even presented China as a new model for the developing world \u2014 a thinly veiled argument that the United States and Europe were no longer as attractive as they once were.\n\nThe need for a strong grip appears to be a long-held conviction of Mr. Xi\u2019s.

One resident, Charna Kommar, 80, who arrived from Moscow in 2004, seemed pleased with the prospect of her new neighbor, saying it was \u201cvery important\u201d to have the embassy in Jerusalem.\n\nAnother small stone building in the compound houses the head office of \u201cBurgers Bar,\u201d a popular Israeli food chain.\n\nSome in Arnona worry that the temporary embassy could prove disruptive.

They could close the roads.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nA fellow driving instructor, Ovadia Tamir, also 52, said that while Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is mired in corruption investigations, might get a political lift from the embassy move, no one else was benefiting.\n\n\u201cThis will only help Netanyahu, nobody else,\u201d Mr. Tamir said.\n\nWorried about Palestinian anger over the coming embassy, he added, \u201cWe don\u2019t want trouble.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, the prime minister commended the news from Washington about the earlier embassy move. \u201cThis is a great moment for the citizens of Israel, and this is an historic moment for the state of Israel,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu said. (American officials also said on Friday that Sheldon G. Adelson, an American known for his hawkish support of Israel, had offered to help pay for the new embassy building.)\n\nThe Palestinians issued more condemnations. \u201cThe United States has become part of the problem and not the solution,\u201d Husam Zomlot, who leads the Palestinian delegation to Washington, told Voice of Palestine Radio.\n\nThe United States may have the anniversary of Israel\u2019s founding in mind as it times the embassy relocation, but the Palestinians view things through a different lens. For them, May 14 is the 70th anniversary of the Nakba, or \u201ccatastrophe,\u201d when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were expelled or fled their homes amid the hostilities surrounding Israel\u2019s establishment.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs it happens, this year\u2019s anniversary could also fall on the eve of Ramadan, the Muslim holy month of fasting, which, depending on the sighting of the new moon, is expected to start at sundown on May 15.

Europeans Offer a Different Solution: A New Chapter                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/26/us/politics/trump-europe-iran-deal.html", "text": "European diplomats said there was scope for an agreement on missiles and inspections, but not yet on the length of the deal. They argue that rewriting those terms would break the bargain they struck, not only with Iran but also with Russia and China, two other signatories. And breaching the deal, they say, would free Iran to pursue nuclear weapons again.\n\nThe upcoming talks are being led by Brian H. Hook, a low-key Republican lawyer who is the State Department\u2019s director of policy planning, who has said he would bring the European request for a guarantee back to Washington. European diplomats said they worry that Mr. Trump\u2019s scorn for the deal runs so deep that he would find other reasons to pull out. Last month, he warned that the accord \u201cis under continuous review, and our participation can be canceled by me as president at any time.\u201d\n\nEven if Mr. Trump did pledge to abide by the deal, it is far from clear that a successor deal would be endorsed by Russia or China, let alone the Iranians, who signaled in recent weeks that they are planning a new project \u2014 a fleet of nuclear-powered ships, fueled by Iranian-made reactors \u2014 that they say would justify resuming the production of nuclear fuel as the limits imposed by the deal expire over the next dozen years.\n\nStill, the mere fact that the United States and Europe are trying to work out a compromise attests to the desire, on both sides, to find a solution that would satisfy Mr. Trump while not unraveling the deal.\n\nThe president\u2019s national security team \u2014 Mr. Tillerson, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, and the national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster \u2014 has on three occasions talked him out of ripping up the deal. With each deadline to reimpose sanctions on Iran, that task gets harder.\n\nThere is an element of diplomatic legerdemain to the exercise, European diplomats acknowledge: How do you convince Mr. Trump that you have changed the deal without actually changing it?\n\n\u201cThe supplemental deal is a diplomatic device that is being used to allow the Europeans to declare victory,\u201d said Mark Dubowitz, a leading critic of the Iran deal who is nevertheless open to the idea.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThey can say they were able to keep the deal, remain steadfast to their commitment not to renegotiate it, but also to satisfy the U.S. and their own concerns that the length of the deal was too short,\u201d said Mr. Dubowitz, the chief executive of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.\n\nBy law, Mr. Trump must decide every 120 days whether to continue suspending longstanding American economic sanctions against Tehran, which the United States committed to lift as part of the deal. If he were to reimpose them, as he has threatened, that would effectively scuttle the deal.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But they could provide a pretext for Iran to resume uranium enrichment.\n\nThe Europeans are most comfortable with enforcing new limits on Iran\u2019s intercontinental ballistic missile development and testing. Missiles are not covered by the nuclear accord, but rather by a United Nations resolution, whose wording was negotiated by then-Secretary of State John Kerry just as the nuclear accord was coming together in Vienna in July 2015.\n\nThe State Department\u2019s talking points said the United States viewed the nuclear and missile programs as \u201cinseparable,\u201d and said that \u201cIran\u2019s development and testing of missiles should be subject to severe sanctions.\u201d The Europeans have not gone that far, at least yet.\n\nInspections are potentially more problematic, given the administration\u2019s rejection of arguments by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps that all military-related sites are off limits to international inspectors.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut this has not been an issue yet: The inspections have been limited to declared nuclear sites, and the United Nations nuclear agency affirmed last week that it had been given all the access it sought. Inspectors have said they would try to inspect military sites only if they had intelligence suggesting that surreptitious nuclear activity was underway.\n\nOnce a deal is struck with the Europeans, administration officials intend to seek approval from Russia, China and Iran. But concerns that such a deal could not possibly pass muster with Iran will not deter them, a senior official said. Russia and China\u2019s lack of participation would also matter little, given the stark consequences for Iran\u2019s economy if Europe and the United States reimpose sanctions, this person said.\n\nWhile American and European negotiators are working feverishly on a deal to preserve the 2015 accord, there are also preliminary discussions about what will happen if they fall short.\n\nReimposing sanctions, such as blacklisting the Central Bank of Iran, would cause serious problems for European companies, potentially precipitating a split in the trans-Atlantic alliance. But the president, Mr. Dubowitz noted, has the authority to phase in sanctions, which he could use as leverage to give negotiators more time to work out an agreement.\n\nHe could, for example, impose sanctions on the central bank for its support of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, which is accused of supporting terrorism, but waive the imposition of so-called secondary sanctions on foreign companies that do business with the bank until the next deadline in July.\n\nFor the Europeans, who are mostly satisfied with the deal and face no domestic political pressure to pull out, there is little joy in this exercise. But they feel they have no choice but to go along with it.

Patriotism and respect for the military is so high in this country that we have lately held a national debate over whether professional athletes should be required to stand for the national anthem.

Young is his own case in point. He sees his experience \u2014 three tours in Iraq \u2014 as far from heroic. He is at least as disturbed by his duty as he is proud of it. These contradictory feelings are a central theme in his book. Years removed, he both loathes and pines for the man he became in the Marine Corps.

None of the simulations favored Republicans by anywhere near as much as the congressional map enacted in 2011, which gave the Republicans a 13-to-5 advantage. And partly on that basis, the court ruled that the map violated the state\u2019s constitution.\n\nBut what about the remedial map recently adopted by the court? It is not an outlier to the same extent as the Republican-drawn map. But if you look at what 2016 statewide results would have been with the new map, the overall Democratic performance arguably would have been better than in all 500 of Mr. Chen\u2019s simulations, according to an Upshot analysis.\n\nOne common measure of a congressional map is to look at the result of the median congressional district in the average statewide election (here, the five contests in 2016). The larger the gap between the median and the average statewide popular vote, the harder it is to win a majority of seats despite winning the popular vote. By that measure, the new map was better for the Democrats than all 500 of Mr. Chen\u2019s simulations.\n\nAnother measure is simply how many districts the Democrats would have won in various statewide contests (here, the average of how many contests were won across the same five contests). Only one simulation was better for Democrats.\n\nThe strong Democratic showing compared with Mr. Chen\u2019s simulations doesn\u2019t necessarily indicate that the map is a Democratic gerrymander. For one, the simulations aren\u2019t perfect. And they aren\u2019t necessarily representative of realistic partisan-blind maps. To take a concrete example: The simulations often split the city of Pittsburgh, something few human map-drawers would choose to do given the requirement to avoid unnecessarily splitting municipalities.\n\nPerhaps more important, the remedial map still slightly favors the Republicans with respect to the statewide popular vote.\n\nIn the average 2016 contest on the new map, Democrats would have carried an average of 8.4 districts (out of 18), even though Democrats won the statewide popular vote in the average contest. The median congressional district favored the Republicans by a point in the average 2016 contest.\n\nOver all, the new court-ordered map comes very close to achieving partisan symmetry in an evenly divided state.\n\nThe seeming contradiction between the analysis based on partisan symmetry and one based on simulated nonpartisan congressional districts gets at the heart of what may be the next big debate in gerrymandering: whether nonpartisan maps should strive for partisan symmetry, or whether they should try to avoid political considerations altogether.\n\nThe question is important because both methods of analysis are routinely employed to identify Republican gerrymanders.\n\nAnd it is likely to continue to be a question, because it emerges when Democrats are at a geographic disadvantage, as they often tend to be. Just look at Pennsylvania. Democrats waste more votes than Republicans by carrying urban areas, like Pittsburgh or Philadelphia, by more lopsided margins than the Republicans carry their best areas. The result is that the rest of the state, and therefore the rest of its districts, tend to favor Republicans.\n\nIf one believes that partisan symmetry should be a goal in redistricting, the new map is eminently fair. It gives both parties a similar chance to translate their votes to seats, and makes no compromises to do so; it still admirably adheres to standard nonpartisan criteria like compactness or minimizing county splits.\n\nThe Upshot analysis also helps address a more arcane matter in the debate about the new court-ordered map: why many nonpartisan analysts thought it favored Democrats, even though it seemed to score well \u2014 it wasn\u2019t an outlier \u2014 by the measure of Mr. Chen\u2019s analysis. The reason is simple: Most nonpartisan analysts have judged the map by today\u2019s electoral landscape, while Mr. Chen\u2019s analysis used elections from 2008 and 2010.\n\nBack then, Pennsylvania\u2019s political geography did not pose such a severe challenge to Democrats. But since then, the Democrats\u2019 geographic disadvantage has worsened. State and national Democrats lost ground in traditionally Democratic areas in western and northeastern Pennsylvania where the party still excelled as late as 2008 and 2010; they gained additional ground in many urban and suburban areas where Democrats already had an advantage. As a result, Mr. Chen\u2019s simulations imply that Democrats were at a notable geographic disadvantage in 2016, but not 2008 or 2010.\n\nWhatever the limitations of these simulations, the fact remains that the court seemed to find this sort of analysis persuasive. The strong Democratic performance on the remedial map adopted last week may imply that the map was drawn with consideration for attaining partisan symmetry, and perhaps even specifically by the measure of average Democratic performance in 2016 statewide elections.\n\nNate Cohn is a domestic correspondent for The Upshot.

", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/26/magazine/how-long-can-john-kelly-hang-on.html", "text": "For most of his 67 years, Kelly, a retired four-star Marine general who projects the weary asceticism of a TV cop perpetually two weeks from retirement, might have been out of place among Mar-a-Lago\u2019s bronzed faces and gilded trimmings. But by mid-February, this was one of the few rooms where he could still expect such a warm reception. Back in Washington, the scandal surrounding his handling of abuse claims against a top aide, Rob Porter, hummed through its second week \u2014 an unusual longevity in a White House where news of a Trump lawyer\u2019s pre-election hush payment to a porn star had come and gone without great consequence. More surprising still was how quickly, and unshakably, the crisis attached itself to Kelly, whose sins \u2014 praising the aide too forcefully before his departure, purportedly sitting on the allegations for months without acting \u2014 felt airlifted from an era of more traditional Washington cover-ups. Kelly held onto his job through the weekend, which did not initially seem like a given. But Trump had already been musing privately about possible replacements.\n\nEven among Trump critics, Kelly once inspired uncommon sympathy. While other high-level officials, like Jeff Sessions and Rex Tillerson, had invited doubts about how long they could possibly tolerate working in the administration, Kelly\u2019s responsibilities seemed uniquely masochistic: He was the chief disciplinarian in a famously undisciplined White House. \u201cYou never run into somebody like Trump in the military,\u201d Panetta told me. \u201cThey\u2019d usually get kicked out.\u201d The job itself was premised on a paradox: If Trump weren\u2019t Trump, Kelly\u2019s position would be bearable. And if Trump weren\u2019t Trump, you would not need a John Kelly.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNow, Kelly\u2019s struggle has grown lonelier \u2014 informed, even before the Porter affair, by yawning cracks in his once-broad base of support. Some of Trump\u2019s deepest skeptics had convinced themselves, despite a career\u2019s worth of counterevidence, that a well-traveled military man might temper the president\u2019s instincts, particularly on immigration. Then there were Kelly\u2019s friends, who had already worried that the job was bending Kelly to its will, and not the other way around.\n\nShortly after Election Day, Senator Tom Cotton, the Arkansas Republican, went to Trump Tower to see the president-elect. Trump was preparing to staff his cabinet, and he asked Cotton, an Iraq war veteran, to name the best general of this generation. Cotton chose Kelly. \u201cThe president didn\u2019t know about General Kelly and asked me to tell him more,\u201d Cotton told me. In December, Trump nominated Kelly to run the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nUnlike many prospective additions to the administration, Kelly had stayed out of the 2016 campaign. In an interview with Foreign Policy that July, he said he would be willing to serve in either a Trump or a Clinton administration but made plain his distaste for the \u201ccesspool of domestic politics.\u201d \u201cTo join in the political fray, I don\u2019t think it convinces anyone,\u201d he said, chiding fellow military leaders who had lined up behind candidates. \u201cIt just becomes a talking point on CNN.\u201d\n\nHis confirmation process was mostly incident-free, specked with the kind of John Wayne dialogue that had dazzled Trump from the start. Before Kelly\u2019s Senate hearing, an aide who helped him prepare, Blain Rethmeier, noticed the general had neglected to attach a flag pin to his lapel. \u201cBlain,\u201d Kelly told him, declining the pin, \u201cI am an American flag.\u201d He was confirmed on Inauguration Day, 88 votes to 11. \u201cA great choice,\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, said at the time.\n\nKelly grew up in Boston\u2019s Brighton section, the Catholic-school-educated son of a postal worker; fellow Marines later joked that his accent required a Boston-to-English translator. In his own telling, he was shaped by two forces in the neighborhood: men who had worn the military uniform \u2014 his father, his uncles, everyone on the block \u2014 and the ubiquitous drug use among his peers. \u201cHe would claim that growing up in South Boston, he lost most of everybody he grew up with to drugs,\u201d Adam Isacson, the director of defense oversight at the Washington Office on Latin America, told me, recalling meetings with Kelly when he led the United States Southern Command. \u201cIt was part of his persona.\u201d\n\nBy the time the Iraq war began, Kelly, by then a three-decade veteran of the corps, had become the first Marine promoted to brigadier general in an active combat zone in over half a century, according to the Marines. On Barack Obama\u2019s first trip to Iraq as the presumed Democratic nominee in July 2008, Kelly rode with him in an armored truck across Anbar Province. His career advanced rapidly during Obama\u2019s first term, and in 2012, he was named to head the Southern Command (\u201cSouthcom\u201d), charged with overseeing United States military operations in Central and South America and the Caribbean.\n\nUnder Obama, Kelly \u2014 a typically conservative Marine, friends say \u2014 was nominally tasked with steering the country toward policies he often abhorred. After officials pushed the repeal of \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell,\u201d Kelly seethed. \u201cMarines will die from this,\u201d he told colleagues at the Pentagon. (The Trump White House disputes this.) He was also a fierce defender of the status quo at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, which fell under his command, publicly criticizing efforts to close the facility and chafing at media accounts that humanized those being held there. When some detainees began a hunger strike during Obama\u2019s second term, Kelly feared that the issue was being framed too sympathetically. His charges were instructed to call the act \u201clong-term nonreligious fasting\u201d instead.\n\nBut perhaps Kelly\u2019s most instructive experiences at Southcom involved the scourge of trafficking \u2014 drugs, weapons, people. From command headquarters, just outside Miami, he tracked narcotics production in Colombia and Guatemala. At a forum in 2015, Kelly recalled meeting an official from Customs and Border Protection who oversaw some 200 miles of the Mexico-Texas line. \u201cI asked her how much cocaine she got last year. She said, proud as she could be, \u2018642 pounds,\u2019 \u201d Kelly said. \u201cThat\u2019s pocket litter to me. I got 191 metric tons last year.\u201d He also charted the rise of MS-13, an international criminal gang that had become a security threat across Central America.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nKelly seemed to see immigration almost entirely through the prism of security \u2014 paralleling Trump\u2019s campaign, which nodded to the zero-sum economic view of immigration prominent on the right for years, but dwelled far more on blood-and-guts anecdotes of violent crime by immigrants. Although Southcom\u2019s area of responsibility does not include Mexico, this did not discourage Kelly from holding forth on the country, making claims that, according to Obama-administration officials, sometimes contradicted the intelligence of Northcom, the Pentagon command covering Mexico. At the height of the Ebola scare of 2014, he suggested publicly that the disease would spark a stampede across the border, incensing White House staff members who thought he was stoking panic. \u201cIf it breaks out, it\u2019s literally, \u2018Katie, bar the door,\u2019 \u201d Kelly said. \u201cAnd there will be mass migration into the United States.\u201d\n\nAs he assumed control at Homeland Security, Kelly implied that his views on immigration were more nuanced than Trump\u2019s, infused with compassion for a region whose leaders he had come to know personally. In preconfirmation testimony, Kelly accused the United States of \u201cignoring what our drug demand does to the people of Central and South America,\u201d whose countries had devolved at times into \u201cnearly failed narco-states.\u201d He positioned himself as a moderate voice in sessions with lawmakers, casting doubt on the wisdom of a massive border wall. Speaking to a group of Democrats last year, he suggested that undocumented immigrants without a serious criminal footprint would not be enforcement priorities. \u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019m the best thing to happen to DACA recipients,\u2019 \u201d Representative Nanette Diaz Barrag\u00e1n, a California Democrat, told me.\n\nThe benefit of the doubt lasted nine days. On Jan. 29, Trump signed an executive order barring entry to the United States by residents of seven predominantly Muslim countries, inciting large protests at airports across the country \u2014 and a backlash against Democrats who had voted to confirm Kelly, whose department was left to carry out the order. Kelly told angry lawmakers that responsibility for the chaos was \u201call on me.\u201d In reality, according to an exhaustive Inspector General\u2019s report released early this year, Kelly and his team were caught almost entirely off-guard. He told investigators that \u201che had assumed that White House staff had proactively engaged Congress and other stakeholders\u201d before the order was signed, according to the report. Publicly, Kelly cheered the spirit of the measure, arguing that a federal court order blocking the ban was preventing the nation from doing \u201call that we can to weed out potential wrongdoers from these locations.\u201d Privately, he faulted the execution. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen again,\u201d he told the White House.\n\nAt the same time, Kelly was making good on a signature Trump campaign promise. Immigration officers arrested more than 140,000 people in 2017, a sharp uptick. \u201cWe questioned the fact that many of these arrests were taking place when parents were dropping off their children to go to school,\u201d Representative Nydia Vel\u00e1zquez, a Democrat from New York who met with Kelly at the time, told me. \u201cHe didn\u2019t back down.\u201d\n\nBy then, most Democrats had seen enough. \u201cHe\u2019s disappointing to me,\u201d Schumer decided by February of last year, suggesting in an interview that Kelly was probably \u201cregretting going in.\u201d\n\nKelly betrayed no second thoughts in public. He also began taking on duties that appeared to be outside his jurisdiction. When news broke that Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, worked to establish a secret communications channel with Russian diplomats during the transition, it was Kelly who defended the effort on television as \u201ca good thing.\u201d In May, addressing a private breakfast with former diplomats and foreign-policy experts, Kelly said he had suggested to Tillerson, the ever-beleaguered secretary of state, that he could \u201ctake care of Central America\u201d while Tillerson confronted first-order headaches like North Korea, according to a person in the room. (A White House spokesman disputes this account.)\n\nIt was no secret, by then, that Trump had grown disenchanted with his first chief of staff, Reince Priebus, who presided over a team consumed by squabbling factions, endless leaks and overbroad walk-in privileges for presidential face time. (During one Oval Office meeting Trump had with New York Times reporters in April, no fewer than 20 people came and went.) In an interview with The Times last December, Kelly said that he told Trump around this time that he did not believe the president \u201cwas being well served by the staff\u201d in some respects. A month and a half later, Kelly recalled, Trump called and said, \u201cI need you to be chief.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Once, Vice President Mike Pence showed up for one unexpectedly. \u201cYou guys have the meeting,\u201d Kelly grumbled, walking off, according to a White House official who witnessed the exchange.\n\nFor decades, the White House chief of staff\u2019s mandate has been a kind of tough love \u2014 the capacity to close the door to the Oval Office and tell the president what he does not want to hear. \u201cAbove all, you are the honest broker of information,\u201d Chris Whipple, the author of \u201cThe Gatekeepers,\u201d a history of White House chiefs, told me. True to this template, Kelly clamped down on the free flow of information to Trump, who once rifled through Breitbart articles and conspiracy-stuffed printouts with impunity. Some executive riffraff was expelled altogether. \u201cHe fired me like a gentleman,\u201d says Anthony Scaramucci, who lasted 11 days as communications director and scolds anyone who suggests it was 10. Those who dared attempt an unsanctioned chat with the president could expect a Kelly follow-up: \u201cYou want to be chief of staff?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe early purges, which included the exits of the advisers Stephen K. Bannon and Sebastian Gorka, restored a measure of good will toward Kelly among Democrats. But again, Kelly\u2019s kinship with Trump on immigration was underestimated. \u201cPart of that is the Marine in him, part of that is the Irish guy in Boston who believes that in the end, you really do have to abide by the laws,\u201d Panetta, a friend of Kelly\u2019s, told me. \u201cI think that\u2019s what\u2019s coming out now.\u201d\n\nIn November, as Homeland Security was set to extend residency permits for tens of thousands of Hondurans living in the United States, Kelly made an 11th-hour plea to the department\u2019s acting secretary to reconsider the move. When the administration debated lowering the annual cap on refugees \u2014 should it stay at 110,000? Fall to 50,000, the minimum recommended by Defense and State Department officials? Land somewhere in between? \u2014 Kelly offered his take: If it were his call, he said, the number would be between zero and one. The administration settled on 45,000.\n\nEven as Kelly has driven out the most flamboyant West Wing agitators \u2014 Scaramucci, Omarosa Manigault Newman, Bannon, Gorka \u2014 it has not gone unnoticed that Stephen Miller, the 32-year-old senior policy adviser and Trump\u2019s nativist id on immigration policy since the campaign, has thrived on Kelly\u2019s watch. \u201cHe turns out to have been more hawkish than I might have expected,\u201d Mark Krikorian, the executive director of the hard-line Center for Immigration Studies, told me of Kelly. \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasant surprise.\u201d\n\nIn January, several Senate moderates believed they were close to securing Trump\u2019s support for a compromise measure protecting the young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers, in exchange for border-security funding and other policy adjustments. Trump invited some of them to a televised summit at the White House, where he told them he would approve any legislation they brought him. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say, \u2018Oh, gee, I want this, or I want that,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll be signing it.\u201d He even assured Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, that he welcomed a stand-alone bill protecting the Dreamers from deportation \u2014 anathema to the negotiating position of Republicans in Congress, some of whom rushed to dissuade him at the table.\n\nKelly sat silently through the televised session. But after about an hour, when the cameras were dismissed and the meeting began in earnest, he unburdened himself in what four attendees described as a caustic scolding. \u201cYou\u2019ve been fiddling around for years on immigration,\u201d he told lawmakers. The time had come, he said before leaving in a huff, to \u201cdo your job.\u201d Attendees were handed a document labeled \u201cMUST HAVE\u2019S,\u201d outlining the administration\u2019s demands: billions in border-wall funding, an end to \u201cextended chain migration\u201d and a move toward a \u201cmerit-based system\u201d for legal immigration. These were requirements long pushed by Kelly and Miller and likely to sink any deal with Democrats.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Trump asked, according to three people present, eyeballing the list of what were ostensibly his own policy directives. He suggested the papers were unhelpful and could be disregarded. Lawmakers left the meeting unsure if the president knew his own administration\u2019s position, or if he was even responsible for it.\n\nDays later, a bipartisan group of senators led by Dick Durbin of Illinois and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina thought again that they could sell Trump on their plans, only to be thwarted anew. This time, they did not conceal their frustrations with Kelly in particular. \u201cI don\u2019t think he was well served by his staff,\u201d Graham said of the president to reporters at the Capitol. And Kelly, he said, was \u201cpart of the staff.\u201d\n\nIn another meeting with Hispanic congressional Democrats later in January, Kelly made the case once more for a \u201cmerit-based system\u201d for legal immigration. Members reminded him what he was asking of them. \u201cHe\u2019s saying this to 25 members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus!\u201d Representative Luis Guti\u00e9rrez, an Illinois Democrat, told me. \u201cMy mom came with a fifth-grade education. Someone stood up and said to him, \u2018So you don\u2019t think we should even be here?\u2019 We\u2019re the children of those parents. And we\u2019re members of Congress.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nKelly\u2019s active role in immigration policy, Whipple told me, was highly unusual for a chief of staff, setting Kelly apart from even otherwise partisan warriors like Dick Cheney, who served as chief to Gerald Ford, and Rahm Emanuel, the first to hold the position under Obama. \u201cThis is abnormal,\u201d Whipple said. \u201cHe\u2019s been more partisan than almost any chief of staff I can think of.\u201d\n\nIt took a mass shooting and another round of Russia intrigue to elbow speculation about Kelly\u2019s job status, post-Porter scandal, temporarily out of the news. \u201cTrying to keep below the radar particularly after the Porter issue and my involvement was so inaccurately covered,\u201d Kelly told me in an email, declining an interview. But his standing has not necessarily rebounded. This fate seems to flow, in part, from the heightened initial expectations of him. But it also speaks to his shortage of allies in Trump\u2019s inner circle. Rivals, sensing a power vacuum, are wasting no time, spawning a succession of leaks and counterleaks that evoke the Priebus-era West Wing.\n\nToday Kelly holds the support of two incongruous constituencies: those who cheer him on immigration and those who assume, despite the strikes against him, that he is preventing catastrophes no one can see. But this base is shrinking. \u201cOne Donald is bad enough,\u201d Reines, one of the last Democratic holdouts, tweeted as Kelly cycled through conflicting explanations of the Porter timeline in February. \u201cWe don\u2019t need two.\u201d\n\nOlder friends have greeted recent events with a deeper despair. Some war buddies, eager to publicly support Kelly when he took the job, have begged off entirely. \u201cI\u2019d prefer not to talk anymore about him,\u201d Mark Hertling, a retired three-star general who served with Kelly in Iraq, told me, \u201cgiven what I\u2019ve seen lately.\u201d\n\nFor John Allen, a retired four-star general who has known Kelly since the late 1970s and endorsed Clinton in 2016, the first distress signal seemed to come in October. Trump had upset the widow of La David T. Johnson, an Army sergeant who was killed in an ambush in Niger, by telling her that her husband \u201cknew what he signed up for.\u201d Defending himself afterward, Trump falsely accused Obama of not contacting the families of fallen troops at all, adding (truthfully) that Obama did not call Kelly when his son First Lt. Robert Kelly was killed in Afghanistan in 2010.\n\nKelly, who had long avoided discussing his loss in detail, confirmed as much from the lectern of the White House briefing room. \u201cIt must have been enormously painful for him,\u201d Allen told me. \u201cJohn is very private in his grief.\u201d But Kelly went on to accuse Frederica Wilson, a Florida congresswoman who knew the widow and listened to Trump\u2019s phone call with her, of making self-aggrandizing remarks years earlier. A video from the time quickly proved him wrong, but Kelly never apologized. To friends who had winced often at Trump\u2019s conduct, but never Kelly\u2019s, it was agonizing to watch.\n\nIn the months since, Trump and Kelly have found new reasons to grow sick of each other. Even before the Porter maelstrom began dominating Trump\u2019s cable-news diet, the president had been smarting for weeks over Kelly\u2019s suggestion to Fox News that the president had \u201cevolved\u201d on his wall demands. Both episodes stirred latent frustrations with Kelly\u2019s imperious style, which had grated on Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s a free spirit,\u201d Roger Stone, Trump\u2019s longtime informal adviser, said of the president. \u201cNobody handles Donald Trump. Nobody manages him. He resents those who try.\u201d Trump has been floating Gary Cohn, his economic adviser, as a possible replacement.\n\nBut on immigration, Kelly\u2019s legacy, such as it is, may already be secure. His tumble has coincided with what was supposed to be a period of congressional progress on the issue \u2014 testing the priorities of a president who would still like a wall but thrills at the prospect of any signing ceremony. After appearing inclined at times toward an agreement with Democrats before Kelly helped reel him back, Trump has by now wholly convinced them that he is not to be trusted to cut a deal. Once held up as the administration\u2019s most credible cross-aisle emissary, Kelly has instead become the figure \u2014 even more than Miller, from whom Democrats expected nothing less \u2014 most closely associated with White House intransigence. \u201cHe\u2019s not a martyr, and he\u2019s not a hostage,\u201d Juliette Kayyem, a former assistant secretary at Homeland Security under Obama who has worked with Kelly and who initially cheered his addition to the administration, told me. \u201cJohn Kelly is not saving us.\u201d\n\nThere is a favorite book of Kelly\u2019s that he has said he rereads at key moments of his career. It is \u201cThe General,\u201d a 1936 novel by C.S. Forester, set among British forces around World War I. Principally, it is about a commander unable to meet the moment. \u201cHe is a brave guy, a dedicated guy, a noble guy,\u201d Kelly said of the protagonist, Herbert Curzon, in a collection of book recommendations by military leaders published last year, \u201cbut a guy who in the end has become a corps commander \u2014 a three-star general \u2014 and when presented with an overwhelming German attack couldn\u2019t figure out how to deal with it because he\u2019d never developed himself intellectually.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOutmatched by his circumstances, Curzon resolves, at least, to fall on his terms. \u201cHe didn\u2019t know the great lessons of the great master, if you will,\u201d Kelly said, \u201cand then he just decided one day to go down to his horse, grab his sword, and attack \u2014 with the intent of dying.\u201d", "keywords": ["staff", "kellys", "president", "trumps", "hang", "trump", "john", "kelly", "white", "long", "immigration", "told", "house"], "polarity": 0.09396856653174344, "subjectivity": 0.40601860534171},

But he urged the administration to proceed cautiously, particularly with regard to allies.\n\nThe Defense Department \u201ccontinues to be concerned about the negative impact on our key allies regarding the recommended options within the reports,\u201d Mr. Mattis wrote. He urged the administration to consider tariffs targeted at specific countries and to focus on what he described as the underlying problem \u2014 Chinese overproduction.\n\nYet the United States could face a challenge in crafting trade sanctions that circumvent allies and target China. It has already imposed a variety of restrictions on Chinese aluminum and steel. But American steel and aluminum producers argue that China still harms them indirectly by routing goods through third countries, as well as depressing global prices to a level where American manufacturers cannot compete.\n\nAlthough China has promised to cut its steel and aluminum capacity, it has made only slow, modest progress. That is why some American metal makers have argued for broader protections.\n\nCanada accounted for more than half of American imports of aluminum in 2016, followed distantly by Russia and the United Arab Emirates. Canada also made up the largest share of American steel imports in 2016 \u2014 17 percent \u2014 followed by Brazil, South Korea, Mexico and Turkey. China did not rank among the top 10 suppliers of either metal.\n\n\u201cFrom a defense perspective, it makes no sense to limit imports from Canada in the future,\u201d said Alf Barrios, the chief executive of Rio Tinto Aluminum, which exports aluminum from Canada to the United States. \u201cCanada is a longstanding, reliable supply for any needs the United States might have.\u201d\n\nCanada\u2019s inclusion in the Commerce Department recommendations was unexpected, in part because companies and workers have been relatively united in calling for the country to be exempted. The operations of many metal makers \u2014 as well as the United Steelworkers, their largest union \u2014 stretch across the border. Under law, Canada is included as part of the United States defense industrial base, and the growth of its aluminum industry dates back to supporting the United States during World War II.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

Britain, Australia, Europe and Japan would also be included under the kind of blanket tariff or quota recently floated by the Commerce Department.\n\nThe measures could fall particularly hard on South Korea, which was named as one of the countries that would face a 53 percent tariff on its steel exports, along with China, Brazil, India, Russia, Turkey and six others, under one potential scenario in the report.\n\nThe United States has been seeking South Korea\u2019s cooperation to combat a nuclear threat from North Korea. But the Trump administration has simultaneously pursued the country on trade, largely because South Korea maintains a large trade surplus with the United States. The administration is renegotiating its free trade deal with South Korea, and the country was a target of an earlier tariff on washing machines.\n\nIncluding countries like Canada could lead to unintended ramifications for the United States military and economy.\n\nMany products made in America use foreign metals, including the Ford F-150, a classic American truck that is consistently ranked as one of the most \u201cmade-in-America\u201d vehicles in an industry known for sourcing parts from around the world.\n\nThe truck\u2019s engine and transmission are American-made, and the truck is assembled in plants in Dearborn, Mich., and Claycomo, Mo. Even so, the truck is made of Canadian aluminum, some of which comes from Rio Tinto\u2019s aluminum works in Quebec \u2014 an area with plentiful hydropower, which is needed for the energy-intensive process of producing aluminum.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFrom Quebec, some aluminum travels to a plant in upstate New York owned by Novelis, which combines it with recycled aluminum and rolls it out into wide sheets for Ford.\n\nAnother 15 percent of the value of the truck\u2019s components come from Mexico. Its window wipers come from a factory in Matamoros, some of its wheels from Chihuahua, and some of the pistons in its engine from Ramos Arizpe.\n\nThe auto industry says this web of North American suppliers allows it to produce cars and trucks at a quality and a price to compete with products made around the world. Ford exports the truck back to Canada, and last year it announced that it would begin exporting vehicles to China as well.\n\nEconomists say the companies that make aluminum into car bodies and soda cans employ far more people than the smelters that make raw aluminum itself. Novelis, which specializes in recycling and rolling aluminum out into sheets, announced in January that it would invest $300 million to open a new factory in Guthrie, Ky., to make the aluminum sheeting used in cars.\n\nThe same trends are true in the steel industry. In mid-February, 15 American industry associations that buy steel to make their products wrote a letter to Mr. Trump arguing that, by raising the price of steel, restrictions on imports could do more harm than good. They said they represented more than one million jobs in the United States, compared with about 80,000 jobs in primary steel production.\n\nOther economic forces are driving aluminum smelting from the United States. Aluminum manufacturing is extremely energy intensive, so it has tended to go to parts of the world with cheap excess energy, like the Middle East, Iceland and Canada. Smelters in the United States must compete with other, more profitable businesses for electricity, like computer server farms.", "keywords": ["steel", "industry", "aluminum", "aimed", "states", "trade", "ensnare", "south", "trump", "united", "china", "sanctions", "american", "canada"], "polarity": 0.07730344368275403, "subjectivity": 0.3849612073750004},

Kelly, the White House chief of staff who imposed order on the West Wing through a strict hierarchy that left Mr. Navarro out of high-level meetings, has also been beset by rumors that he has lost standing in the White House over a series of recent negative events.\n\nAmid the tumult, Mr. Navarro has been able to leverage a close personal relationship with the president to gain more access, a third trade expert close to the White House said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

But the biggest change for Mr. Navarro is that he may once again gain more access to top meetings \u2014 and to the president himself.\n\nMr. Navarro presided over an early period on the campaign trail and in the White House, during which President Trump appeared poised to fulfill his most aggressive promises on trade, including ripping up trade deals that he had criticized as bad for American companies and workers and imposing tariffs on imports.\n\nMr. Navarro entered the White House with multiple trade actions written and ready for the president\u2019s signature, including a directive to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement, known as Nafta. As The New York Times has previously reported, on at least three occasions in the president\u2019s first year in office, Mr. Navarro\u2019s attempts to withdraw the United States from Nafta were blocked by more pro-trade advisers, headed by Mr. Cohn.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe president did sign another directive authored by Mr. Navarro, pulling the United States out of a multinational trade deal known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership. But other efforts by Mr. Navarro to impose tariffs on steel imports and withdraw from a free-trade agreement with South Korea were blocked, leading some to question whether the president had abandoned his promise to take a more aggressive approach to trade than his predecessors.\n\nAs Mr. Kelly imposed order on the White House by limiting the president\u2019s access to some advisers, Mr. Navarro\u2019s influence was reduced. Mr. Navarro was required to copy Mr. Cohn, his new superior, on all emails. He was absent from some high-level strategy meetings on trade, as well as the president\u2019s trip to China, a focus of Mr. Navarro\u2019s.\n\nSupporters and opponents of Mr. Navarro describe this as a concerted effort by more pro-trade factions to keep the president from hearing Mr. Navarro\u2019s views, which could have goaded Mr. Trump into more aggressive action.\n\nMr. Navarro is a Ph.D. economist and a former professor at the University of California, Irvine, but some of his ideas on trade have been criticized by mainstream economists. While most economists say Nafta has benefited the United States economy on the whole, Mr. Navarro has sharply criticized the deal. He has denounced some foreign investments as \u201cconquest by purchase\u201d and argued for retracting global supply chains back within the United States\u2019 borders.\n\nFrom a nearby post in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, Mr. Navarro spent months focusing on trade measures that were less in the spotlight, including expanding provisions that require the government to buy American goods, and carrying out a government-wide review of the defense industry.\n\nIn the last few months, however, the Trump administration has ramped up its trade actions. The White House announced tariffs on washing machines and solar cells and modules in January. The administration is also on the cusp of announcing tariffs or other restrictions on imports of steel and aluminum, as well as measures to penalize China for unfair trade.\n\nIn an expanded post, Mr. Navarro may be particularly influential on combating China. Mr. Navarro has authored books including \u201cDeath by China\u201d and \u201cThe Coming China Wars,\u201d which advocated the type of aggressive trade stance toward China that is now widely echoed by officials in the Trump administration.", "keywords": ["navarros", "ascendant", "president", "trade", "mr", "navarro", "white", "china", "office", "united", "skeptic", "peter", "house"], "polarity": 0.08425676055546187, "subjectivity": 0.27828859452236077},
{"title": "\n                    Behind a Key Anti-Labor Case, a Web of Conservative Donors                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/25/business/economy/labor-court-conservatives.html", "text": "And Mr. Uihlein has donated well over $1 million over the years to groups like the Federalist Society that work to orient the judiciary in a more conservative direction. They have helped produce a Supreme Court that most experts expect to rule in Mr. Janus\u2019s favor.\n\nThe case illustrates the cohesiveness with which conservative philanthropists have taken on unions in recent decades. \u201cIt\u2019s a mistake to look at the Janus case and earlier litigation as isolated episodes,\u201d said Alexander Hertel-Fernandez, a Columbia University political scientist who studies conservative groups. \u201cIt\u2019s part of a multipronged, multitiered strategy.\u201d\n\nIn doing so, these donors have not just brought labor to the brink of crisis but threatened the Democratic Party as well.\n\nAmid changes in the campaign finance landscape and the decline of private-sector unions, the party and its candidates have increasingly relied on major public unions for funding, including hundreds of millions of dollars in direct and indirect spending during the 2016 presidential cycle. Those unions include the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, whose Council 31 is the defendant in the Janus case.\n\nPhoto\n\nA recent paper by Mr. Hertel-Fernandez and two colleagues may foretell what Democrats can expect if Mr. Uihlein and his fellow philanthropists succeed. It found that the Democratic share of the presidential vote dropped by an average of 3.5 percentage points after the passage of so-called right-to-work laws allowing employees to avoid paying union fees. That is larger than Democrats\u2019 margin of defeat in several states that could have reversed their last three presidential losses.\n\nAnd that is clearly on the mind of Republicans. In a recent interview, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, acknowledged the potential of the Janus case to hurt Democratic fund-raising for the coming midterm elections. \u201cIn states where they got rid of the automatic deduction and employees figured they could keep their own money, they did,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it could have an impact.\u201d\n\nConservative groups aren\u2019t alone in locking arms to advance an ideological agenda. For decades, liberal donors and foundations, sometimes working together through coalitions like the Democracy Alliance, have promoted liberal goals in a variety of ways. Some backed groups, like the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and the GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders, that used litigation to move American society leftward.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut the extent of the coordination on the right often dwarfs liberal efforts. Especially on the state level, conservative groups are \u201cdoing different things, mobilizing different constituencies,\u201d Mr. Hertel-Fernandez said. \u201cBut they\u2019re all working with one another. You don\u2019t see the same thing on the left.\u201d\n\nAs the percentage of unionized private-sector workers has collapsed in recent decades, public-sector unions, which have held steady in the mid-30s since the early 1980s, have increasingly become a target.\n\nConservatives chafe at the unions\u2019 political influence, which they believe not only props up the Democratic Party but also drives up government spending and skews public policy on issues like education.\n\nIn 2011, Wisconsin rolled back the right of most public unions to bargain over anything other than wages and eliminated the requirement that nonmembers pay fees. The portion of unionized public-sector workers in the state plummeted from half to just over one-quarter within five years.\n\nIn seeking to produce similar results nationally, conservative donors have created a symbiosis between groups aiming to overturn Supreme Court precedent favorable to unions and groups that take advantage of those rulings to drain unions of members.\n\nThe Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation of Wisconsin, which had over $800 million in assets in 2016, has funded both kinds of organizations.\n\nIn a 2014 case brought by a group that had received more than $1 million in contributions from the Bradley Foundation, the Supreme Court ruled that home-care aides and other \u201cpartial-public employees\u201d paid through Medicaid could not be forced to pay fair-share fees if they left their unions. Unions say these fees, typically about 80 percent of standard dues, are necessary to compensate them for representing nonmembers in bargaining and grievance proceedings.\n\nPhoto\n\nThen in 2016, the court heard a case, Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association, that could have struck down fair-share fee requirements for all public employees represented by unions in more than 20 states, including California, Illinois and New York. The case was brought by a group that has received millions of dollars from the Bradley Foundation.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDuring 2015 and 2016, the foundation also substantially increased its contributions, totaling well over $1 million, to groups like the Independence Institute of Colorado and the Freedom Foundation of Washington State. Those groups have used such tools as direct mail, phone calls and door knocking to persuade public-sector workers to give up union membership.\n\nRichard Graber, the chief executive of the Bradley Foundation, said the foundation avoided short-term tactical considerations in its giving. But he acknowledged that the increase was driven partly by the recent Supreme Court developments, which promised to make such opt-out campaigns more compelling for union members. (Some conservative groups are currently raising money for even more ambitious opt-out campaigns to take advantage of a favorable ruling this year.)\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

That gave the Liberty Justice Center, backed by Mr. Uihlein, a chance to try again.\n\nFew philanthropists have funded a more sweeping assault on labor than Mr. Uihlein, who with his wife, Elizabeth, founded a Wisconsin-based shipping supply company called Uline.\n\nMr. Uihlein is an ardent conservative who considers many Republican office holders too moderate on fiscal and social issues, according to those who know him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just politics for him,\u201d said his friend Leonard A. Leo, the Federalist Society executive vice president, who declined to offer specifics on Mr. Uihlein\u2019s views. \u201cI think he is philosophically attuned to conservative ideas,\u201d added Mr. Leo, whom the Trump White House enlisted to shepherd the Supreme Court nomination of Neil M. Gorsuch, Justice Scalia\u2019s successor.\n\nThe Uihleins have spent tens of millions of dollars over the past decade supporting Republican candidates and committees. That includes contributions to super PACs backing the 2016 presidential campaigns of Mr. Walker and Mr. Cruz, and at least $250,000 to help Mr. Walker survive a 2012 recall election. (Mr. Uihlein did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nThe Uihleins appear to be preoccupied with state employee pensions and the unions that negotiate them.\n\n\u201cBruce is the only one in the race who isn\u2019t beholden to public-sector unions,\u201d Mr. Uihlein said of Mr. Rauner, the year before his 2014 election as Illinois governor, in an interview with Crain\u2019s Business Chicago. The Uihleins gave more than $2.5 million to his campaign.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Rauner has been a major ally in the fight against public-sector unions. Shortly after taking office in 2015, he challenged the constitutionality of mandatory union fees in federal court.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBy the time a judge ruled that Mr. Rauner lacked standing for his lawsuit, the Illinois Policy Institute, which drew more than one-third of its $5.8 million in revenue that year from Mr. Uihlein\u2019s foundation, had found a viable plaintiff to replace him: Mark Janus. The Liberty Justice Center and the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation, which Mr. Uihlein also contributes to, represented Mr. Janus in court.\n\nSince then, the policy institute has sought to persuade state employees to leave their union through its mailing campaign. It said it had obtained employees\u2019 names through Freedom of Information Act requests.\n\nMr. Rauner\u2019s administration has amplified the institute\u2019s message, and vice versa. In an August 2016 email to state workers, the administration highlighted a benefit of giving up union membership and urged workers to visit a website that would help them do so. The policy institute soon promoted the same website and provided similar guidance in its mailings to state workers.\n\nMr. Uihlein\u2019s foundation has supplemented these efforts by supporting a nonprofit called Think Freely Media, which uses storytelling techniques to champion free-market ideas, including right-to-work laws. The Uihlein foundation contributed more than $1.5 million to Think Freely from 2014 to 2016, the last year for which tax records are available.\n\nAt the center of this network is a longtime conservative activist named John Tillman, who serves as the chief executive of the Illinois Policy Institute as well as the chairman of the Liberty Justice Center and Think Freely Media.\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Tillman, who managed a call center earlier in his career and talked up his \u201cmarketing-centric approach\u201d to promoting free enterprise, said the institute is fighting the enormous power of union leaders but is not anti-union per se.\n\n\u201cIn the late 1800s, early 20th century, business owners had all the power, and workers had very little power,\u201d he said. \u201cUnions and collective bargaining emerged as a way to level the playing field. I think it was an amazing story of success.\u201d\n\nBut in other contexts, Mr. Tillman has been less conciliatory.\n\nIn a fund-raising solicitation by the policy institute in December, Mr. Tillman claimed credit for helping more than 2,600 workers leave their union, resulting in a loss of $1.2 million in union revenue.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for Illinois to throw off the shackles of big labor and big government,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cWhen you and I look around Illinois and see the devastation the union-dominated status quo has inflicted,\u201d he continued, \u201cwe simply have no choice.\u201d", "keywords": ["conservative", "uihlein", "antilabor", "million", "mr", "2016", "case", "groups", "web", "state", "donors", "key", "union", "foundation", "unions"], "polarity": 0.09862651815776817, "subjectivity": 0.3657816257816257},

Mr. Kim seized on Mr. Moon\u2019s peace overtures before the Olympics to send his sister, Kim Yo-jong, to the opening ceremony and a large contingent of cheerleaders and athletes to the Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea.\n\nBut Mr. Moon also knows he must convince the Americans to give him a chance. In a sign of how hard that will be, and how deeply the United States and North Korea distrust each other, Mr. Pence, who was Washington\u2019s envoy to the opening ceremony, and Ms. Kim would not even look at each other despite being seated only a few feet apart.\n\nOn Friday, Mr. Moon argued for a South Korean-brokered peace and for the United States-North Korea talks when he met with President Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump, who arrived to attend the Games\u2019 closing ceremony. He told her he wanted to improve ties \u201cin parallel\u201d with efforts to denuclearize the North.\n\nAnalysts said that once the Olympics ended, Mr. Moon would be left to sort out how much of the North\u2019s so-called charm offensive, in which it refrained from provocations like missile tests, could last.\n\n\u201cSouth and North Korea used the Olympics to use each other,\u201d said Yoo Dong-ryul, director of the Korea Institute for Liberal Democracy in Seoul. \u201cThe South was desperate to ease tensions. The North wanted to soften its image and weaken international sanctions. Now comes the hard part for Moon, after the Olympics.\u201d\n\nWithout a solution to the nuclear issue, relations between the two Koreas \u201cwill eventually revert to the same crisis mode before the Olympics,\u201d Mr. Yoo said.\n\nPhoto\n\nSo far, Washington and Pyongyang seem unable to talk.

But the United States insists it will never enter any serious negotiations or ease sanctions until the North commits itself to nuclear disarmament.\n\nOver the weekend, Mr. Trump announced harsh new sanctions against North Korea and warned of tougher measures if the North fails to relinquish its nuclear arsenal.\n\nThe hard line out of Washington has stood in conspicuous contrast with the more conciliatory gestures from Seoul.\n\nDavid Straub, a former American diplomat who is now a fellow at the Sejong Institute in South Korea, said there were rising frustrations in Washington that Mr. Moon was \u201capparently working at cross purposes with the Trump administration\u2019s effort to apply \u2018maximum pressure\u2019 on North Korea.\u201d\n\nThis \u201ccould result in a serious clash of wills between the two allied leaders,\u201d Mr. Straub said. \u201cIf the Trump administration or the Moon administation does not change its fundamental position, the odds are increasing that relations between the two will worsen.\u201d\n\nMr. Moon, a dogged advocate of dialogue with the North, had spent the last year helplessly watching the Korean Peninsula edge toward active war, as the North test-launched intercontinental ballistic missiles and conducted its most powerful nuclear test, and Mr. Trump threatened to rain down \u201cfire and fury\u201d on North Korea.\n\nDesperate to avoid a possible military conflict, Mr. Moon seized upon the Pyeongchang Games to craft what some analysts called an \u201cOlympic truce.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The first step, according to these officials, is for the administration to settle on a more consistent message toward North Korea.\n\nThe United States has veered in recent weeks from expressing openness to diplomacy to reiterating threats of military action if the North does not curb its nuclear and missile programs. The net effect, according to analysts, has been to confuse both North and South Korea.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhite House officials will also have to decide how to react if the inter-Korean diplomacy accelerates. The Trump administration is determined not to make undue concessions to North Korea, a mistake it says both Democratic and Republican presidents have made. On the other hand, if the United States takes too hard a position, analysts said it could prompt Mr. Moon to conclude that the Americans will never come around.\n\nThat could prompt Mr. Moon to set off on his own, isolating the United States by driving away one of its most important allies in Asia, which could end up drifting closer to China.\n\n\u201cOnce the ball gets rolling, it\u2019s very hard to stop, in large part because Seoul and Beijing want talks so badly,\u201d said Evan S.

That\u2019s what\u2019s interesting.\n\nWhat do you think it was about this role, and this film, that led to so many awards?\n\nIt\u2019s the transformational aspect of it, the fact that he was really many different roles wrapped up in one role. He\u2019s a doofus, he\u2019s a racist, he\u2019s violent, he\u2019s a mama\u2019s boy. There\u2019s a few heroic things at certain points. But he\u2019s very flawed, and it\u2019s a boy-to-man journey.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThere\u2019s been criticism that your character got away scot-free for his racist behavior and for throwing a guy out the window, and never being brought to justice.\n\nIt\u2019s a small town and, who knows, in real life maybe he would have gotten thrown in prison. It\u2019s a sort of dark fairy tale in certain ways \u2014 it\u2019s not necessarily meant to be completely realistic. And if it is meant to be realistic, in real life, things aren\u2019t tied up in a bow. People who deserve to get punished don\u2019t necessarily get punished.\n\nDid it surprise you that there was criticism of the movie along these lines?\n\nNo, whenever a movie is popular and it is a complex dramatic story, I think it\u2019s going to stir up a lot of feelings. A lot of good stuff come out of it \u2014 the billboards that have been popping up [activists recreated versions of the billboards in Miami and London]. That\u2019s kind of incredible, when a movie can effect social change, that\u2019s kind of astounding. I think Mildred [the film\u2019s mother, played by Frances McDormand, who is seeking justice in the murder of her daughter] is a really beautiful working-class wonder woman in some ways. It\u2019s a kind of antihero slash protagonist thing that I think women really need right now. Mildred and [the directors] Greta Gerwig and Patty Jenkins. It\u2019s been an incredibly vibrant year.\n\nYou\u2019re a really good dancer \u2014 you can really bust a move. You did the splits on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d How did that come about? Is it self-taught?\n\nIt\u2019s a long story, but I hung out with a certain crowd, and it was a way to meet girls.\n\nWhat kind of certain crowd?\n\nSan Francisco is not all cable cars and Rice-A-Roni. There were some tough kids there. When I was in middle school, there was a more white supremacist kind of group I didn\u2019t get along with. I got in a lot of fights with them and didn\u2019t win a lot of those fights. I didn\u2019t get along with the rich kids, people we called WPODs: white punks on dope. My school was interracial, and I met a cool group of friends who introduced me to some other friends. I used to do really bad break dancing, when \u201cThriller\u201d and \u201cPurple Rain\u201d came out. I was into Run-DMC, Grandmaster Flash, Doug E. Fresh, Eric B. & Rakim. Probably my biggest inspiration was James Brown, and watching Tom Cruise in \u201cRisky Business.\u201d I remember practicing that, and watching James Brown do the splits. I [recently] did SoulCycle, I\u2019m not proud to say, and Usher was next to me. I thought I had rhythm until I was on a bicycle next to Usher. This is what happens when you go to spinning class in Hollywood.\n\nWere you intimidated working with Frances McDormand?\n\nI think it\u2019s the biggest compliment to Frances that people are asking, \u201cWere you intimidated by her?\u201d Not really, but I was nervous to get in the ring with a great actor. I\u2019ve worked with a lot of great actors. She\u2019s really a force. I think what\u2019s great about her is her integrity. Her sense of truth is like an iron bar. All these people \u2014 Woody [Harrelson, a co-star], Martin [McDonagh, the film\u2019s writer-director], Frances \u2014 are true anarchists, they really are. I think it comes through in their work. I\u2019m not exactly conventional either.\n\nSo your dad posted a comment on that New York Times essay criticizing the film \u2014 he defended you. Was it definitely your dad?\n\nYes that was my father. I didn\u2019t read the article, but they read that quote to me on the Jimmy Kimmel show. That was my dad being a supportive father. He was just looking out for the kid.", "keywords": ["york", "movie", "past", "think", "secret", "hes", "dancer", "lot", "sam", "rockwell", "break", "thats", "character", "really", "actor", "bad", "kind"], "polarity": 0.20883392294682618, "subjectivity": 0.5147564353209513},

While it may not be a common vantage point, the narrative is a natural one for Marilyn Stern, a photographer and graphic artist who is a member of the Metropolitan Postcard Club of New York City.\n\nNot surprisingly, the vast majority of postcards that feature black people in the United States from the 19th and 20th centuries were very racist, she said.\n\n\u201cI was so sick of seeing these horrible racist stereotypes,\u201d said Ms. Stern, a collector since the mid-1970s. \u201cWhenever I came across something that was not racist or not stereotypical, or even went so far as showing romance between the races, I wanted to save it and collect it.\u201d\n\nHer collection, which numbers about 3,000, has about 300 postcards that depict African-American life in all lights.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard for us to fathom how isolated people were, especially in rural areas and isolated small towns before there were telephones and radios,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were postal deliveries three times a day, so it was the internet of the early 1900s.\u201d\n\nPostcards had better printing technology than magazines and newspapers did at the time, as the burst of color in the selection below shows. They could show racism with clarity. \u201cThe idea that you could see images so realistic blew people away,\u201d she said.\n\nMany of the racist postcards were a form of propaganda, she said.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important to see how racism was manifested in the past,\u201d she said, \u201cperhaps to better fight it in the present. You can recognize something if you\u2019ve seen it before.\u201d\n\nBelow is a selection from Ms. Stern\u2019s collection with descriptions based on her research.\n\nTrade Cards\n\nImage\n\nAfrican-Americans were often subjects \u2014 and targets \u2014 of advertising cards that were issued before 1900. These cards were frequently given away in products, or with the purchase of a product.\n\nAbove, an advertisement for J & P Coats thread. Below, a country doctor dispensing Ayer\u2019s Cathartic Pills.\n\nImage\n\nThe Cakewalk\n\nImage\n\nThe Cakewalk, a dance created by plantation slaves as a satire of Southern white society, was the focus of these cards, which featured two black children and an African-American troupe that toured Europe in the late 1800s and early 1900s.\n\nRacist Cards\n\nImage\n\nThe card on the left was shot in a professional studio, but it was labeled \u201cHer Country Cousins.\u201d The implication was that no matter how refined, educated or successful black Americans became, they were still basically savages, Ms. Stern said.\n\nThe two cards on the right were produced in 1905 in New York on the common theme of the delivery stork. The first one, with the caption \u201cComparing Notes,\u201d shows both a black baby and a white baby, with no apparent bias. The second one shows two black babies with the slogan \u201cNo Race Suicide,\u201d implying that a high black birthrate threatened white supremacy, she said.\n\n\u201cLovers of All Nations\u201d\n\nImage\n\nThis postcard was from a series mailed in 1908 that was called \u201cLovers of All Nations.\u201d The banjo was a racial stereotype, but the card is in the non-discriminating \u201cFamily of Man\u201d tradition.\n\nMemories of Slavery\n\nImage\n\nPostcards once served as documentary photography. Some cards honored older African-Americans of the South, who were living memories of slavery. This was part of a series, and it was mailed in 1906.\n\nLife in the Jim Crow South\n\nImage\n\nA fortuneteller with white clients, mailed in 1908.\n\nHoliday Greetings\n\nImage\n\nIdealized country life, in a card mailed in 1907, as Americans flocked to cities.\n\nReligion\n\nImage\n\nA card, likely from the early 1950s, urging parishioners to come to church.\n\nReal Photos\n\nImage\n\nAn unidentified young woman in her graduation cap and gown, in a studio portrait taken between the 1920s and \u201940s. Cards labeled \u201cReal Photo Postcards\u201d are set apart from commercially printed postcards and are actual photographs printed on photographic paper with a preprinted postcard back.\n\nAchievement\n\nImage\n\nThe many important contributions that African-Americans made to society were rarely acknowledged in older postcards, but an exception was made for the scientist and educator George Washington Carver.\n\nHis experiments with peanuts, sweet potatoes and other crops contributed greatly to the economy of the South. This card \u2014 from a photo shot on Kodachrome or Ektachrome film \u2014 is from the late 1950s to mid-60s.\n\nFor more, see Ms. Stern\u2019s postcard blog, and a review of the film Through a Lens Darkly that deals with African-American representation in postcards and photography.

But those seeking to dismiss their stories of pain and demands for equality argued that the payments were proof that their accounts could not be trusted.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cYou get this idea immediately after the war, during these testimonies, that people talking about civil rights are literally getting paid\u201d to tell fabricated stories, Ms. Richardson said.\n\nThat belief spread to other contexts, too.

Wakanda is no more or less imaginary than the Africa conjured by Hume or Trevor-Roper, or the one canonized in such Hollywood offerings as \u2018Tarzan.\u2019 It is a redemptive counter-mythology.\u201d\n\nThe Women of Wakanda\n\n\u2018Finally, \u201cBlack Panther\u201d Is a Movie Black Women Can Celebrate\u2019 [Independent]\n\nThe film is earning heaps of praise for its female characters. The journalist and activist Adebola Lamuye writes: \u201cFor those of us who have struggled to find multifaceted representations of ourselves, this is it. The dark-skinned female superhero finally looks like me, my sister, my mother, my friends. Female suffering is not used as a narrative device \u2014 instead women are the best spies Wakanda has to offer, fearless warriors and scientific genius responsible for the nation\u2019s technological advancements.\u201d\n\n\u2018Kevin Feige on the Future of Marvel\u2019s Women\u2019 [Vulture]\n\nWill \u201cBlack Panther\u201d fan favorites like Lupita Nyong\u2019o\u2019s Nakia and Letitia Wright\u2019s Shuri ever get their own movies? \u201cIt is all about figuring out when and how,\u201d said Kevin Feige, the president of Marvel Studios, in an interview with Vulture\u2019s Kyle Buchanan. \u201cBut by the way, many of them have already filmed additional scenes in upcoming movies, so some of that is gonna come sooner rather than later.

Carter designed costumes for \u201cDo the Right Thing,\u201d \u201cMalcolm X,\u201d \u201cLove & Basketball\u201d and many other films before clothing the nation of Wakanda in \u201cBlack Panther.\u201d In an interview with Channing Hargrove, she explained: \u201cOur aesthetic was always to bring about positive visuals to the African diaspora in this country. And to dispel stereotypes. To be about a forward-thinking community that empowered the black community, women and even natural hair.\u201d\n\nA Few Thought-Provoking Critiques\n\n\u2018\u201cBlack Panther\u201d Is Great. But Let\u2019s Not Treat It as an Act of Resistance.\u2019 [The Guardian]\n\n\n\nAlthough she\u2019s as excited about the film as anyone else, the writer Khanya Khondlo Mtshali cautions viewers, \u201cIf we behave as though purchasing a ticket to see a film produced by Disney is a form of resistance, we fail to distinguish between black art that touches on revolutionary themes, and the actual work required for revolution itself.\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201cBlack Panther\u201d Is Not the Movie We Deserve\u2019 [Boston Review]\n\nChristopher Lebron was troubled by Coogler\u2019s representation of black American men. \u201cIn 2018, a world home to both the Movement for Black Lives and a president who identifies white supremacists as fine people, we are given a movie about black empowerment where the only redeemed blacks are African nobles,\u201d he writes. \u201cThey safeguard virtue and goodness against the threat not of white Americans or Europeans, but a black American man, the most dangerous person in the world.\u201d\n\nThe Rumored Love Story That Never Panned Out\n\n\u2018\u201cBlack Panther\u201d Screenwriter Joe Robert Cole Addresses Rumors of a Deleted Gay Scene\u2019 [ScreenCrush]\n\nLast spring, Vanity Fair\u2019s Joanna Robinson got her hands on early footage of a flirtatious moment between two female characters, Danai Gurira\u2019s Okoye and Florence Kasumba\u2019s Ayo. The scene never made it into the movie. So, what happened? In a conversation with ScreenCrush\u2019s E. Oliver Whitney, the screenwriter Joe Robert Cole, one of the writers for \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d says he vaguely recalls some discussion of whether to include the lesbian love story. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t some major theme through that we were looking to explore with [those characters] in terms of the story,\u201d Cole clarifies. \u201cWe didn\u2019t like, pull out a full thread of some theme.\u201d\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t Play With Our Emotions: \u201cBlack Panther\u201d and Queer Representation\u2019 [The Root]\n\nBriana Lawrence, who identifies as a queer black woman, was surprised that the scene\u2019s exclusion didn\u2019t bother her. \u201cI should\u2019ve been cursing Ryan Coogler out, swift and fast like my mama taught me when someone pisses me off,\u201d she writes. \u201cBut after thinking it over, I\u2019m happy the scene didn\u2019t make it into the movie, and that feels blasphemous to admit as someone who is always championing representation \u2014 especially for queer folks of color like me.\u201d\n\nHeartwarming Bonus Read: \u2018I Took 7th Graders to See \u201cBlack Panther.\u201d Here\u2019s What They Said.\u2019 [The New York Times]\n\nProf. Kevin Noble Maillard watched the film with a handful of tweens from a Brooklyn public school. A lively post-screening conversation prompted insights like this observation from Jaheim Hedge: \u201cFor people of color, it shows us that we can get through any obstacles that are thrown at us if we work together.

I love you guys.\u201d\n\nSeemingly channeling Earnhardt, who went by the nickname The Intimidator, Dillon bumped the leader Aric Almirola on the last lap, pushing him into the wall before zooming past. Almirola, who had raced in Petty\u2019s No. 43 car last year, fell back all the way to 11th.\n\nAlmirola said he understood.\n\n\u201cIt was the last lap and we\u2019re all trying to win the Daytona 500,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were just racing aggressively.

As he took the interview podium in the media workroom, his mother, Desiree Wallace, ran up and hugged her son as both melted into tears. As the embrace continued for more than a minute, Wallace said to his mother, \u201cYou act like I won the race.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe did,\u201d she responded.\n\nBefore the start, Wallace had received well-wishes from the four-time Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton, who, like Wallace, is biracial.\n\nAnd then, minutes before the race, Wallace was told he had an important phone call \u2014 from Hank Aaron, who, like Wallace, was born in Mobile, Ala.\n\n\u201cHe said good luck, and just have a good race,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cHe knew that we were pressed for time. That was cool.\u201d\n\nWallace wiped away tears throughout his post-race news conference, his voice often cracking.\n\n\u201cNo matter what the circumstances are, when you have family here and you run good and it\u2019s been a while since you\u2019ve been somewhat competitive, it pulls on the heartstrings.

Wallace had managed to dodge all the wrecks for the whole race \u2014 one of which knocked out Danica Patrick, prematurely ending her final Nascar race \u2014 until the final lap when he got bumped into the wall by Denny Hamlin.\n\nWallace said Petty appeared livid when he first saw him after the race.\n\n\u201cHe walked in and says, \u2018What\u2019s the first thing I told you?\u2019\u201d Wallace recalled. \u201cAnd he has a stern attitude and look.

Alex Bowman, 24, who replaced Earnhardt in the No. 88 car for Hendrick Motorsports, will start the Daytona 500 from the pole position.

A graduate of Nascar\u2019s Drive for Diversity program, Darrell Wallace Jr., 24, could give stock car racing something it has never had before: an African-American star.\n\nBut that is not why Richard Petty brought Wallace onto his team. Late last season, Wallace, who goes by the nickname Bubba, got four rides with Richard Petty Motorsports. It was enough for Petty, one of Nascar\u2019s most iconic names, to not only give Wallace a full-time ride, but also to give him his famed No. 43 racecar to drive. Wallace is the first African-American to drive full-time in the top Nascar series since Wendell Scott in 1971.\n\nPetty insisted, though, that he is colorblind when it comes to evaluating talent. Sure, it would be great if Wallace brings the sport into the African-American community, but as far as Petty is concerned, that\u2019s secondary.\n\n\u201cI hope he advances us as a race team,\u201d Petty said in an email. \u201cI care about what Bubba can do behind the wheel for us. The rest, there are a lot of eyes on Bubba, but he\u2019s handling it well. I know come Sunday he\u2019ll be ready to get into a racecar and just show his talent. If he does well, the rest will come and he\u2019ll grow our fan base.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThose eyes on Wallace, much as they were on Tiger Woods a generation ago, prompted Earnhardt to call him last week.

But there\u2019s also venturing out into a different market, into different avenues where the African-American culture lives. We all have to do better at that.\u201d\n\nThere are challenges, of course. On social media, where vulgar epithets can be spewed from faceless and fictitious monikers, Wallace has, at times, had to think twice before responding. He admits he has not always been successful.\n\n\u201cThere is always going to be haters out there, people who don\u2019t want to see you succeed,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been told that since Day 1 from my parents. Just keep your head down and keep moving, that\u2019s the best you can do.\u201d\n\nBlaney, his closest friend on the circuit, has been around Wallace when offensive remarks have been made.\n\n\u201cThankfully, it\u2019s very, very rare, but it upsets me,\u201d Blaney said. \u201cBubba\u2019s great at handling it. He\u2019s an amazing ambassador for the sport. And he\u2019s really talented and a heck of a competitor. All of us are competitive, but his competitiveness is unlike anyone I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\nNascar\u2019s diversity has become an issue again after its only female racer, Danica Patrick, announced she will retire from the circuit after the Daytona 500. But Wallace is not the only driver who can energize an overlooked community. What he can do for an African-American audience, Su\u00e1rez can do for the Latino market. A native of Monterrey, Mexico, Su\u00e1rez said he had noticed an uptick in social media messages from a variety of Latino countries.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s usually either people who tell me they\u2019re now following the sport because of me, or they\u2019ve been fans and now they have a driver to root for,\u201d said Su\u00e1rez, who is also a graduate of the Drive for Diversity program. \u201cThe potential is huge. This is the most diverse country in the world, but we have to improve diversity in Nascar. If we can make the sport more diverse, we\u2019ll see the same thing with fans.

At every level of society, people have grown accustomed to kickbacks and political connections determining who prospers, and who goes without.\n\nMr. Zuma\u2019s demise resonates as a sign of a potential new order taking shape. He will forever be linked to his association with the Guptas, three Indian-born brothers who effectively bought key levers of governmental power, amassing influence so comprehensive that it became known as \u201cstate capture.\u201d\n\nHis resignation has raised hopes that South Africa is finally contending with its epidemic of corruption. That view gained momentum when an elite police unit raided a home belonging to the Guptas nearly at the same moment that Mr. Ramaphosa was assuming office.\n\nThe new president is a hero of the anti-apartheid struggle, a former deputy president and chairman of the National Planning Commission, a focal point for thinking about how to engineer economic growth. As a former trade union leader and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Mr. Mandela, he enjoys credibility among a range of interest groups, while carrying a reputation as a savvy and strategic operator.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe has had his brushes with controversy, most notably after a 2012 police massacre of striking platinum miners that killed 34 people. At the time, Mr. Ramaphosa occupied a seat on the board of Lonmin, the company that owned the mine. Emails soon surfaced showing that, a day before the police opened fire, Mr. Ramaphosa had been urging senior government officials to take strong action to end the strike.\n\nPhoto\n\nStill, no corruption charges have stuck to the new president, who now claims a mandate to clean up the toxic mess left behind by Mr. Zuma.\n\nSome doubt whether the A.N.C. can be salvaged as an effective vehicle for egalitarian policymaking. The party\u2019s executive ranks include many figures implicated in corruption. Mr. Ramaphosa, 65, may champion new initiatives aimed at generating economic growth, yet he finds himself relying on his party brethren to execute his visions, with no certainty that the money will land where intended.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t necessarily think that taking the president out does much to dismantle the patronage network,\u201d said Ayabonga Cawe, a development economist at Xesibe Holdings, a research and advisory firm in Johannesburg. \u201cYou\u2019re going to need a lot more than taking out the guy at the top.\u201d\n\nAbove all, Mr. Ramaphosa must contend with the structural defects that have long constrained South Africa\u2019s economy, a legacy of apartheid.\n\nBeyond its systemic discrimination against black people, apartheid severed the country from much of the global economy. It ensured that huge numbers of uneducated black South Africans were available at poverty-level wages within major sectors of the economy like mining, agriculture and textiles. That cushioned domestic companies from the pressure to modernize.\n\nPhoto\n\nInternational sanctions isolated South Africa, shielding its firms from competition against multinational rivals. Sanctions also denied South African companies the ability to operate abroad, giving them an incentive to focus on the domestic market. The apartheid-era government obliged with subsidies for favored firms while allowing companies to pursue oligopoly, free of nuisances like antitrust law.\n\nThe result was a system in which large industries, from retail to furniture-making to chemicals, were dominated by huge enterprises whose core strength was the ability to protect themselves against competition. That system has largely prevailed, with smaller companies and start-ups facing often-impossible odds.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cApartheid was a system that lends itself to large conglomerates and concentrations of wealth in the hands of a few,\u201d Mr. Cawe said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about the corruption. It\u2019s about all of these parallel networks in big business that you need to dismantle. Most of those are white.\u201d\n\nHere is a world that Mr. Ramaphosa knows keenly, having achieved extraordinary affluence by running South African companies with interests in mining, banking, real estate and telecommunications. His fortune has been estimated at $450 million.\n\nIf he is serious about reinvigorating the economy and creating a space for black-owned small businesses, he will need to take on the prevailing structure that made him so wealthy.\n\nHis success on that front may be even more decisive than whether he can tame corruption.\n\n\u201cThis is certainly the most optimistic moment for South Africa in a very long time,\u201d said Mr. Goldin, the former adviser to Mr. Mandela. \u201cIn a way, it does feel like a new beginning.

The aggressive pace of deportations of immigrants of color, the elimination of the DACA program protecting immigrant children and the proposals propounded by the anti-immigration voices in the administration will all have the undeniable effect of slowing the rapid racial diversification of the United States population. Despite this sweeping attempt at racial social engineering, few voices in progressive and Democratic circles are responding with the kinds of outrage that one would expect.\n\nThe pro-white preferences of Donald Trump and his administration, especially when it comes to immigration, are legion. From the day he opened his presidential campaign in 2015 by demonizing Mexicans to the enthusiasm generated by the calls for building a wall along the Mexican border to aggressively ramping up deportations of immigrants of color to eliminating DACA to vulgarly denigrating African nations and Haiti, this administration has been quite clear about its preference for white people.\n\nIt should be no surprise, then, that the immigration policies championed by the White House would all have the effect of reducing the number of people of color coming into the country. A recent study by The Washington Post found that the administration\u2019s proposals to curtail legal immigration by limiting family reunification would slightly delay the date when whites become a minority. \u201cBy greatly slashing the number of Hispanic and black African immigrants entering America, this proposal would reshape the future United States,\u201d the economist Michael Clemens said.\n\n\u201cDecades ahead,\u201d he added, \u201cmany fewer of us would be nonwhite or have nonwhite people in our families.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe administration\u2019s focus is not random.

Since the passage of the 1965 Immigration and Naturalization Act, the chromatic composition of the country\u2019s population has undergone a fundamental transformation. People of color used to make up 12 percent of the United States population in 1965, and that percentage has more than tripled over the past several decades to the point where nonwhite people are nearly 39 percent of the residents of the United States (it is no accident that the country\u2019s first African-American president was elected when he was elected). Mr. Trump\u2019s team understands that the specific laws it seeks to eliminate have played a significant role in that demographic revolution.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

The very first immigration law passed, the Naturalization Act of 1790, declared that to become a citizen, one had to be a \u201cfree white person.\u201d That demarcation was the explicit law of the land for the next 162 years, until 1952. There are 20th-century Supreme Court cases explicitly holding that Asian immigrants could not become United States citizens because they were not white. Even after 1952, the practical effect of immigration policy continued to promote white people above others through mechanisms such as the Asia Pacific Triangle, which restricted immigration from Asian countries.", "keywords": ["color", "sign", "wants", "states", "trump", "america", "white", "population", "nonwhite", "immigration", "immigrants", "united", "effect"], "polarity": 0.07678771845438513, "subjectivity": 0.2882194965528299},

Almost all of those who led the campaign to bring him to account were black, like Thuli Madonsela, the former public protector, who played a heroic role in exposing Mr. Zuma\u2019s corruption. South Africa\u2019s judiciary, which is majority black, defended the independence of the courts with extraordinary courage and under great pressure. After this display of black courage, why would it matter what white people think?\n\nBut South Africa is too fraught and complex a place for such a simple story to ring true. More plausible is that each pinprick penetrating Mr. Zuma\u2019s skin is felt by black South Africans, even those who are horrified by what he has done.\n\nBeneath the surface of public life, one can detect a strange, subliminal to-and-fro. Last year, for instance, a superb book describing in meticulous detail the deep corruption of the late apartheid years, \u201cApartheid Guns and Money,\u201d by Hennie van Vuuren, was a runaway best seller. It deserved to be widely read, but the scale of its success is partly a function of its utility as a weapon against white arrogance. \u201cHowever bad Zuma is,\u201d its many black readers could say to themselves, \u201cyou people were worse.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nTo shrug and say that we are all equally capable of stealing public money is to miss what is distinctive about the mess Mr. Zuma has made. For the truth is that Mr. Zuma and his allies were corrupt partly because they felt a sense of grievance intimately connected to their experience of race.\n\nWhen Mr. Zuma became president of South Africa in 2009, he rallied behind him an alliance of people who felt themselves to be marginal and neglected, not just in relation to the world economic order or white South Africa but also in relation to the A.N.C. itself. The A.N.C. has been run by people drawn from the ranks of an urbane, cosmopolitan elite.\n\nMr. Zuma represented a dramatic change in this tradition. Although he spent years in exile and climbed the ranks of the A.N.C., his biography was unlike any of his predecessors\u2019. Nelson Mandela was born into royalty. Thabo Mbeki was the son of prominent intellectuals. Mr. Zuma\u2019s mother worked in the kitchen of a white family and was too poor to provide her son with a formal education. He grew up herding cattle in the hinterland.\n\nWhen he came to power in 2009, he did so with the support of organizations representing much of the urban working class \u2014 the country\u2019s largest trade union and the South African Communist Party.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut he soon dropped these organizations and turned for support to rural South Africa, in particular to traditional leaders and to the elites of far-flung provincial capitals. They carried with them into power an abiding sense of powerlessness, a feeling that the very institutions they now controlled were alien and belonged to others. In office, they believed that they had entered into their enemy\u2019s mansion. It seemed to be payback time.\n\nIn a speech delivered to a room of black businesspeople in December 2016, Mr. Zuma warned of the sophisticated ways in which the enemy confuses black people. One source of such confusion was the prevailing economic orthodoxy. Mr. Zuma suggested that the most fundamental of economic laws was merely nominal; remove the scales from our eyes and we see that so-called economic laws are a ruse invented by the powerful.\n\nHis genre of criminality is light-years from the sort that characterized the apartheid state. The corruption of apartheid\u2019s leaders stemmed from arrogance; they believed that they could control the world forever. Mr. Zuma\u2019s corruption stems from the grievances of a man who feels very small.\n\nThis sense of grievance was on display in the last words he uttered publicly as president. In a swipe at his successor, Mr. Ramaphosa, Mr. Zuma suggested that those in the party who had unseated him were \u201cserving the interests of the oppressors of yesteryear, who joyfully celebrate as we lynch one another.\u201d\n\nBlack nationalism in South Africa has many faces. Mr. Ramaphosa represents a strand that is bourgeois, worldly and comfortable with power. There is also a militant, socialist strand of black nationalism, but it is on the wane. And there is the strand represented by Mr. Zuma, who governed as a man shaped and distorted by the violence and oppression of white supremacy.\n\nI am of course alive to the irony of a white South African like me saying that a black president\u2019s corruption was motivated by racial grievance. Many South Africans, black and white, would regard this argument as an excuse for the intolerable. But we should be honest enough to accept that even now, notwithstanding that apartheid has been gone since before nearly half the South African population was born, the legacy of white supremacy has lived on in the man who was president.", "keywords": ["jacob", "corruption", "africa", "mr", "apartheid", "zumas", "white", "mess", "whats", "black", "south", "economic", "zuma", "distinctive"], "polarity": 0.0616115067727971, "subjectivity": 0.37158776707163793},

Evenly lit, crisply photographed, they look like pictures from an illustrated medical dictionary, indexical images of heads, torsos and mouths that are detached from context. Even in a work like \u201cFigure\u201d (1991), the figure in question, sheathed in a black dress and set in the black infinity of no particular place, feels like a fragment, as though she had been extracted from a group photo or a furnished room. The texts accompanying her, eight engraved plastic plaques, read like excerpts from a language primer: \u201cfigured the worst,\u201d \u201che was disfigured,\u201d \u201cfigured there would be no reaction\u201d and so on. Here, not only has the story been winnowed down; it is in fact completely gone. There\u2019s no story. We are left with only the tensions of concrete poetry.\n\nSometime in the mid-1990s, Simpson began to detect clich\u00e9d responses to her work. At the same time, her own thinking was evolving. What does an image of a black woman mean? A commentary on race? An assertion about gender? Simpson branched out from figure-based images and began to experiment more with varied subject matter \u2014 landscapes and inanimate objects like wigs \u2014 and also with unusual quasi-sculptural material like felt and standing screens. A series of monumental multisectional images, several of them landscapes, collectively titled \u201cPublic Sex\u201d (1995-1998) and featuring no figures at all, addressed the provocative title only obliquely. These pictures, made over many years, contain what the scholar and curator Okwui Enwezor calls \u201cthe rumor of the body.\u201d Mysteries of a jagged and deadpan sort, they would go on to influence the noirish tone of Simpson\u2019s later film work.\n\nPhoto\n\nSimpson began to set ever more intricate conceptual layers between her initial inspiration for a work and the finished product. The idea for \u201c9 Props\u201d (1995) began during a residency at the Pilchuck Glass School in Washington. With the aid of artisans at the school, she fabricated a series of dark vessels modeled on vases and other objects used in the portrait work of the pioneering Harlem photographer James Van Der Zee. But these vessels were not the final work. She shipped them back to New York and then photographed them against a plain background. And that still was not the work. Further intervention followed: She turned those photographic images into nine lithographs, which she printed on felt. Finally, she wrote captions below each lithographed vessel, describing the context in which it originally appeared. One of them, for instance, reads:\n\nDinner Party with boxer Harry Wills, 1926 James VanDerZee Harry Wills a k a \u201cThe Black Panther,\u201d boxer, businessman- sits with seven other men and women, mostly women with champagne glasses raised as a woman on his left makes a toast in his honor. There are three bottles of champagne, a crystal decanter, a bottle of port, an arrangement of flowers and fruit, and before each guest an untouched china place setting.\n\nPhoto\n\nFrom multiple directions, the work gestures at what cannot be seen: the original placement of the vessels that inspired Simpson\u2019s own, the people in the photographs by James Van Der Zee, the social life of Harlem evoked by his photographs and the complexity of manners and class implied by them. All that vanished world of culture and experience is reduced to an elegant grid, as simple as an antiquarian\u2019s catalog, a thought picture that demands calm engagement and imaginative intervention on the viewer\u2019s part. Without being representational, it is about race; but race is not off in some category by itself, hemmed in only by questions of skin color, separate from life.\n\n\u201cRepresent!\u201d in the black American sense means standing up for your people, expressing solidarity and letting a shared ethos underwrite your presence and work. It is an exhortation, a greeting and a farewell. The word also has more conventional associations. In the visual arts, it is contrasted with the abstract or the symbolic. To represent, in this more common sense, is to make work that visually corresponds to realities out there in the world: to illustrate uncomplicatedly. This second sense of \u201crepresent\u201d is enjoying a vogue in the art world. Realism is back. This is welcome: after so long an absence of black figures and black faces in art museums, they are now being seen more frequently. Many artists, black and otherwise, are depicting the black body. It is necessary and often successful. Just as often, it fails when it is little more than a clumsy shorthand for socially concerned art, unobjectionable and unimpressive.\n\nA strong appeal of Simpson\u2019s work is that she has always embraced the inherent complexity of blackness, her own blackness as well as the blackness that runs ineluctably through American history. She does not reject representational depictions, but neither does she feel the need to confine herself only to \u201crace\u201d work. When an artist uses a black model, she is presenting a human question by foregrounding a human presence. Is a white man a person while a black woman is and can only be a gendered and racialized subject? As the scholar Kellie Jones has pointed out, nonwhite bodies are often thought of as \u201cnot neutral enough for the dispassionate formulas thought to constitute conceptual practice.\u201d If a black woman\u2019s race and gender are the only things apparent to certain viewers, Simpson seems to say, the ethical responsibility to escape those shackles is the viewer\u2019s.\n\nFreedom is Lorna Simpson\u2019s starting point and her permanent theme. A humane current animates all of her work, a current that neither sidesteps nor confines itself to race. Her work is simultaneously about the \u201cneutral\u201d space of ideas and the particularized experience of the body. \u201cMontage\u201d is photographic and painterly, a riff on a pair of found photographs, sequenced to look like a giant strip of film. It deals with dreams and nightmares, ambiguities and vulnerabilities. At its heart is what Simpson calls \u201cthe push and pull of photography\u201d: the stuttering potential inherent in mechanical reproduction and the imperfect registrations that mirror subconscious life. It is a rapid response to the current political climate, situating a crucial part of it in the most intimate space of all, where the hectoring \u201cthey\u201d is temporarily held at bay in favor of the puzzled \u201cI.\u201d In your own sleeping bed, images persist and words are hard to come by.

There would be retaliation for stories they didn\u2019t like, but nothing compared with this. There\u2019s a war going on.

This is a key piece that I don\u2019t think people really get: When you talk about the press, it\u2019s not about journalists; it\u2019s about the free-flowing information that the American public is supposed to get. When you bash the press, you\u2019re bashing the idea of getting truth out.\n\nWhat\u2019s the public opinion of the White House press corps? It depends on whom you talk to. We\u2019re so tribal now.

I was like, No, God, that was a little bit much.\n\nGiven how much you tangle with this particular administration, why do you think you get called on so much? Have you felt like a target? Yes, I have. But I have to shake that off, because I have to go in and do my job. I cover the White House. I cover all issues, particularly those that affect black and brown Americans.

It\u2019s not been one thing. It\u2019s been a pattern. So I asked. He did not answer, which I thought was a wasted moment.

{"title": "\n                    The Many Meanings of Black Panther\u2019s Mask                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/13/style/black-panther-children-costumes.html", "text": "Advertisement\n\nThe Many Meanings of Black Panther\u2019s Mask Image Credit Anthony Piper\n\nIn an interview with BuzzFeed News in the fall, Sterling K. Brown, a star of \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d thrilled at the prospect of children, black and white, dressing up as the title character. \u201cThis Halloween, the first time I see a little kid, a white kid, dressed up as Black Panther, I\u2019m taking a picture,\u201d he said. \u201cYou better believe I\u2019m taking a picture, because that\u2019s the crossover.\u201d\n\nChadwick Boseman, who plays Black Panther in the film, had already witnessed said crossover, he said in the same interview: \u201cI\u2019ve seen little white kids dressed up as T\u2019Challa. I\u2019ve seen pictures, and I\u2019ve seen it in person.\u201d\n\nBlack Panther costumes \u2014 whether the character\u2019s full raiment or just his claws and mask \u2014 are on toy store shelves (and, of course, on Amazon) in anticipation of the film\u2019s Feb. 16 release. At best, the character get-ups speak to the enthusiastic embrace of a black superhero. At worst, they could be perceived as an unwitting form of cultural appropriation, which has in recent years become a subject of freighted discourse.\n\nWhat does that dual significance mean for children? And, perhaps more urgently, what does it mean for the parents who will buy the costumes for them?\n\n\u201cAs parents, or even as the people creating costumes, we need to be very aware of what that says,\u201d said Brigitte Vittrup, an associate professor of early childhood development and education at Texas Woman\u2019s University. \u201cThere\u2019s not a whole lot of black superheroes, so this is a really important thing, especially for black kids growing up.\u201d\n\nMany parents are split on how Black Panther\u2019s blackness should figure into their children\u2019s relationship to the character. Some argue that placing racial boundaries around expressions of fandom is unnecessary.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m actually wondering now what it might be like for that parent who\u2019s not of color if his kid comes home and says, \u2018I want to dress up like Black Panther,\u2019\u201d said Katrina Jones, 39, the director of human resources at Vimeo. \u201cWhen I look at it, I see no reason why a kid who\u2019s not black can\u2019t dress like Black Panther. Just like our kid who\u2019s not white dresses up like Captain America. I think the beautiful thing about comics is they do transcend race in a lot of ways.\u201d\n\nMary Dimacali, 29, a social media and marketing manager in Rockland County, New York, echoed that idea. She does not believe that her fianc\u00e9\u2019s 7-year-old son, Sawyer, who is white, sees the film or its characters through the lens of race. Sawyer himself, during the interview with Ms. Dimacali, said, \u201csure,\u201d when she asked if he\u2019d like to dress up as Black Panther.\n\n\u201cFor a white kid to be so open and judge based on the character\u2019s story and the personality and history, I think that\u2019s what\u2019s important,\u201d she said. \u201cBut on the flip side, I think it\u2019s also great to have a black superhero you can identify and connect to.\u201d\n\nThe character\u2019s history is unique. Created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in 1966, Black Panther rules as the king of an African technological utopia known as Wakanda. Untouched by European invaders, Wakanda exists apart from the legacies of colonization and racism. Black history and black fantasy are central to the character, and the series has brought on prominent black writers including Ta-Nehisi Coates to deepen its significance over the last 50 years.\n\nConsequently, some parents have felt pressure to hammer home Black Panther\u2019s heroism through the lens of race.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m conflicted,\u201d said Evan Narcisse, a senior writer for the website io9. He is completing \u201cRise of the Black Panther,\u201d a six-part comic series for Marvel that traces the character\u2019s early history. He has tried to explain some of that history to his 7-year-old daughter, but without delving too deeply into complex concepts like Western imperialism, which she may struggle to grasp.\n\n\u201cYou want that white kid to be able to think that he can dress up in a Black Panther costume, because, to that kid, there\u2019s no difference between Captain America and Black Panther,\u201d Mr. Narcisse, 45, said. But, he added, it also involves \u201ctrying to explain what is special about T\u2019Challa and Wakanda without racism. And it\u2019s like, \u2018Can\u2019t do it.\u2019 I couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nAccording to the ticketing site Fandango, \u201cBlack Panther\u201d set a record among Marvel films for the most advance tickets sold in a 24-hour period. It\u2019s projected to make a record-breaking $165 million over Presidents\u2019 Day weekend and comparisons to last year\u2019s \u201cWonder Woman\u201d bode well for its reception and impact, particularly for black people.\n\n\u201cWhite people have the privilege of not constantly being reminded of their race in the United States, where white is the majority, whereas as a black person you don\u2019t,\u201d Ms. Vittrup said. She believes that parents in general, and white parents in particular, are reluctant to talk about race with young children. When they do, they often miss the chance to talk about inequality, even though research supports the idea that children develop an awareness of race and difference at a very young age.\n\nMs. Vittrup was careful to add that dressing as Black Panther isn\u2019t inherently appropriative or offensive. The character comes from an invented African country, and to wear his mask isn\u2019t quite the same as wearing blackface. However, in a moment where even more black heroes, like Luke Cage and Black Lightning, are finding their way into the limelight, Black Panther\u2019s relationship with the black community and its history creates an opportunity to teach nonblack children about the black experience.\n\n\u201cKids are not colorblind,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of structural inequality in our society, and kids are noticing that. By not mentioning it, by not talking about it, we\u2019re essentially preserving the status quo.\u201d\n\nFollow Kwame Opam on Twitter: @kwameopam.

{"title": "\n                    Obama Portraits Blend Paint and Politics, and Fact and Fiction                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/12/arts/design/obama-portrait.html", "text": "There are, for sure, outstanding things, one being Gilbert Stuart\u2019s so-called \u201cLansdowne\u201d Portrait\u201d of George Washington from 1796, a full-length likeness packed with executive paraphernalia: papers to be signed, multiple quill pens, a sword, and an Imperial Roman-style chair. Even the clothes are an 18th-century version of current POTUS style: basic black suit and fat tie. As for Washington, he stands blank-faced, one arm extended, like a tenor taking a dignified bow.\n\n[Read remarks from the Obamas and the artists. ]\n\nUninflected dignity was the attitude of choice for well over a century, with a few breaks. In an 1836 portrait, Andrew Jackson, a demonstrative bully, sports a floor-length, red-silk-lined Dracula cloak and a kind of topiary bouffant. (A picture of Jackson, one of President Trump\u2019s populist heroes, hangs in the Oval Office.) Abraham Lincoln, seen in several likenesses, is exceptional for looking as if he may actually have weighty matters on his mind. Most of the portraits that precede and follow his are pure P.R.\n\nThis continues well into the 20th century. In a 1980 painting Jimmy Carter trades a black suit for a beige one. How revolutionary is that? And there\u2019s a Casual Fridays vogue: Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush both go tieless for it. Under the circumstances, Elaine de Kooning\u2019s 1963 portrait of John F. Kennedy, a fanfare of green and blue strokes, hits like a boost of adrenaline. Rousing too, though not in a good way, is a big head shot image of Bill Clinton by the artist Chuck Close. Using his signature mosaic-like painting technique, Mr. Close turns the 42nd president into a pixelated clown.\n\nMr. Obama has much better luck with his similarly high-profile portraitist. Mr. Wiley, born in Los Angeles in 1977, gained a following in the early 2000s with his crisp, glossy, life-size paintings of young African-American men dressed in hip-hop styles, but depicted in the old-master manner of European royal portraits. More recently he has expanded his repertoire to include female subjects, as well as models from Brazil, India, Nigeria and Senegal, creating the collective image of a global black aristocracy.\n\nIn an imposingly scaled painting \u2014 just over seven feet tall \u2014 the artist presents Mr. Obama dressed in the regulation black suit and an open-necked white shirt, and seated on a vaguely thronelike chair not so different from the one seen in Stuart\u2019s Washington portrait. But art historical references stop there. So do tonal echoes of past portraits. Whereas Mr. Obama\u2019s predecessors are, to the man, shown expressionless and composed, Mr. Obama sits tensely forward, frowning, elbows on his knees, arms crossed, as if listening hard. No smiles, no Mr. Nice Guy. He\u2019s still troubleshooting, still in the game.\n\nVideo\n\nHis engaged and assertive demeanor contradicts \u2014 and cosmetically corrects \u2014 the impression he often made in office of being philosophically detached from what was going on around him. At some level, all portraits are propaganda, political or personal. And what makes this one distinctive is the personal part. Mr. Wiley has set Mr. Obama against \u2014 really embedded him in \u2014 a bower of what looks like ground cover. From the greenery sprout flowers that have symbolic meaning for the sitter. African blue lilies represent Kenya, his father\u2019s birthplace; jasmine stands for Hawaii, where Mr. Obama himself was born; chrysanthemums, the official flower of Chicago, reference the city where his political career began, and where he met his wife.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMrs. Obama\u2019s choice of Ms. Sherald as an artist was an enterprising one. Ms. Sherald, who was born in Columbus, Ga., in 1973 and lives in Baltimore, is just beginning to move into the national spotlight after putting her career on hold for some years to deal with a family health crisis, and one of her own. (She had a heart transplant at 39.) Production-wise, she and Mr. Wiley operate quite differently. He runs the equivalent of a multinational art factory, with assistants churning out work. Ms. Sherald, who until a few years ago made her living waiting tables, oversees a studio staff of one, herself.\n\nAt the same time, they have much in common. Both focused early on African-American portraiture precisely because it is so little represented in Western art history. And both tend to blend fact and fiction. Mr. Wiley, with photo-realistic precision, casts actual people in fantastically heroic roles. (He modifies his heroizing in the case of Mr. Obama, but it\u2019s still there.) Ms. Sherald also starts with realism, but softens and abstracts it. She gives all her figures gray-toned skin \u2014 a color with ambiguous racial associations \u2014 and reduces bodies to geometric forms silhouetted against single-color fields.\n\nShe shows Mrs. Obama sitting against a field of light blue, wearing a spreading gown. The dress design, by Michelle Smith, is eye-teasingly complicated: mostly white interrupted by black Op Art-ish blips and patches of striped color suggestive of African textiles. The shape of the dress, rising pyramidally upward, mountain-like, feels as if it were the real subject of the portrait. Mrs. Obama\u2019s face forms the composition\u2019s peak, but could be almost anyone\u2019s face, like a model\u2019s face in a fashion spread. To be honest, I was anticipating \u2014 hoping for \u2014 a bolder, more incisive image of the strong-voiced person I imagine this former first lady to be.\n\nAnd while I\u2019m wishing, let me mention something more. Mr. Obama\u2019s portrait will be installed, long-term, among those of his presidential peers, in a dedicated space on the second floor. Mrs. Obama\u2019s will hang in a corridor reserved for temporary displays of new acquisitions \u2014 on the first floor. It will stay there until November, after which there\u2019s no set-aside place for it to land.\n\nIf first men have an acknowledged showcase, first women \u2014 ladies or not \u2014 should too. Better, they should all be together, sharing space, offering a welcoming environment to, among others, a future first female president, and creating a lasting monument to #MeToo.", "keywords": ["ms", "portraits", "politics", "sherald", "obama", "black", "mr", "wiley", "washington", "paint", "fiction", "portrait", "fact", "blend", "obamas"], "polarity": 0.07208600786186993, "subjectivity": 0.35921572042261696},

It\u2019s been an incredibly vibrant year.\n\nYou\u2019re a really good dancer \u2014 you can really bust a move. You did the splits on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d How did that come about? Is it self-taught?\n\nIt\u2019s a long story, but I hung out with a certain crowd, and it was a way to meet girls.\n\nWhat kind of certain crowd?\n\nSan Francisco is not all cable cars and Rice-A-Roni. There were some tough kids there. When I was in middle school, there was a more white supremacist kind of group I didn\u2019t get along with. I got in a lot of fights with them and didn\u2019t win a lot of those fights. I didn\u2019t get along with the rich kids, people we called WPODs: white punks on dope. My school was interracial, and I met a cool group of friends who introduced me to some other friends. I used to do really bad break dancing, when \u201cThriller\u201d and \u201cPurple Rain\u201d came out. I was into Run-DMC, Grandmaster Flash, Doug E. Fresh, Eric B. & Rakim. Probably my biggest inspiration was James Brown, and watching Tom Cruise in \u201cRisky Business.\u201d I remember practicing that, and watching James Brown do the splits. I [recently] did SoulCycle, I\u2019m not proud to say, and Usher was next to me. I thought I had rhythm until I was on a bicycle next to Usher. This is what happens when you go to spinning class in Hollywood.\n\nWere you intimidated working with Frances McDormand?\n\nI think it\u2019s the biggest compliment to Frances that people are asking, \u201cWere you intimidated by her?\u201d Not really, but I was nervous to get in the ring with a great actor. I\u2019ve worked with a lot of great actors. She\u2019s really a force. I think what\u2019s great about her is her integrity. Her sense of truth is like an iron bar. All these people \u2014 Woody [Harrelson, a co-star], Martin [McDonagh, the film\u2019s writer-director], Frances \u2014 are true anarchists, they really are. I think it comes through in their work. I\u2019m not exactly conventional either.\n\nSo your dad posted a comment on that New York Times essay criticizing the film \u2014 he defended you. Was it definitely your dad?\n\nYes that was my father. I didn\u2019t read the article, but they read that quote to me on the Jimmy Kimmel show. That was my dad being a supportive father. He was just looking out for the kid.", "keywords": ["york", "movie", "past", "think", "secret", "hes", "dancer", "lot", "sam", "rockwell", "break", "thats", "character", "really", "actor", "bad", "kind"], "polarity": 0.20883392294682618, "subjectivity": 0.5147564353209513},

While it may not be a common vantage point, the narrative is a natural one for Marilyn Stern, a photographer and graphic artist who is a member of the Metropolitan Postcard Club of New York City.\n\nNot surprisingly, the vast majority of postcards that feature black people in the United States from the 19th and 20th centuries were very racist, she said.\n\n\u201cI was so sick of seeing these horrible racist stereotypes,\u201d said Ms. Stern, a collector since the mid-1970s. \u201cWhenever I came across something that was not racist or not stereotypical, or even went so far as showing romance between the races, I wanted to save it and collect it.\u201d\n\nHer collection, which numbers about 3,000, has about 300 postcards that depict African-American life in all lights.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard for us to fathom how isolated people were, especially in rural areas and isolated small towns before there were telephones and radios,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were postal deliveries three times a day, so it was the internet of the early 1900s.\u201d\n\nPostcards had better printing technology than magazines and newspapers did at the time, as the burst of color in the selection below shows. They could show racism with clarity. \u201cThe idea that you could see images so realistic blew people away,\u201d she said.\n\nMany of the racist postcards were a form of propaganda, she said.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important to see how racism was manifested in the past,\u201d she said, \u201cperhaps to better fight it in the present. You can recognize something if you\u2019ve seen it before.\u201d\n\nBelow is a selection from Ms. Stern\u2019s collection with descriptions based on her research.\n\nTrade Cards\n\nImage\n\nAfrican-Americans were often subjects \u2014 and targets \u2014 of advertising cards that were issued before 1900. These cards were frequently given away in products, or with the purchase of a product.\n\nAbove, an advertisement for J & P Coats thread. Below, a country doctor dispensing Ayer\u2019s Cathartic Pills.\n\nImage\n\nThe Cakewalk\n\nImage\n\nThe Cakewalk, a dance created by plantation slaves as a satire of Southern white society, was the focus of these cards, which featured two black children and an African-American troupe that toured Europe in the late 1800s and early 1900s.\n\nRacist Cards\n\nImage\n\nThe card on the left was shot in a professional studio, but it was labeled \u201cHer Country Cousins.\u201d The implication was that no matter how refined, educated or successful black Americans became, they were still basically savages, Ms. Stern said.\n\nThe two cards on the right were produced in 1905 in New York on the common theme of the delivery stork. The first one, with the caption \u201cComparing Notes,\u201d shows both a black baby and a white baby, with no apparent bias. The second one shows two black babies with the slogan \u201cNo Race Suicide,\u201d implying that a high black birthrate threatened white supremacy, she said.\n\n\u201cLovers of All Nations\u201d\n\nImage\n\nThis postcard was from a series mailed in 1908 that was called \u201cLovers of All Nations.\u201d The banjo was a racial stereotype, but the card is in the non-discriminating \u201cFamily of Man\u201d tradition.\n\nMemories of Slavery\n\nImage\n\nPostcards once served as documentary photography. Some cards honored older African-Americans of the South, who were living memories of slavery. This was part of a series, and it was mailed in 1906.\n\nLife in the Jim Crow South\n\nImage\n\nA fortuneteller with white clients, mailed in 1908.\n\nHoliday Greetings\n\nImage\n\nIdealized country life, in a card mailed in 1907, as Americans flocked to cities.\n\nReligion\n\nImage\n\nA card, likely from the early 1950s, urging parishioners to come to church.\n\nReal Photos\n\nImage\n\nAn unidentified young woman in her graduation cap and gown, in a studio portrait taken between the 1920s and \u201940s. Cards labeled \u201cReal Photo Postcards\u201d are set apart from commercially printed postcards and are actual photographs printed on photographic paper with a preprinted postcard back.\n\nAchievement\n\nImage\n\nThe many important contributions that African-Americans made to society were rarely acknowledged in older postcards, but an exception was made for the scientist and educator George Washington Carver.\n\nHis experiments with peanuts, sweet potatoes and other crops contributed greatly to the economy of the South. This card \u2014 from a photo shot on Kodachrome or Ektachrome film \u2014 is from the late 1950s to mid-60s.\n\nFor more, see Ms. Stern\u2019s postcard blog, and a review of the film Through a Lens Darkly that deals with African-American representation in postcards and photography.

But those seeking to dismiss their stories of pain and demands for equality argued that the payments were proof that their accounts could not be trusted.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cYou get this idea immediately after the war, during these testimonies, that people talking about civil rights are literally getting paid\u201d to tell fabricated stories, Ms. Richardson said.\n\nThat belief spread to other contexts, too.

The accounts, he said, were \u201cof the lowest kind and utterly unworthy of belief.\u201d\n\nTo Ms. Richardson, those early dismissals of African-American testimony, starting with the congressional hearings during the Reconstruction era, are not unlike the false theories spread about the Parkland school shooting suggesting that the student survivors were actors paid to protest for gun control.\n\n\u201cThat actually sounds very much like what you got in those first congressional hearings,\u201d she said.", "keywords": ["richardson", "isnt", "nonviolent", "spread", "testimony", "york", "sign", "war", "era", "africanamericans", "violence", "smear", "civil", "actor", "crisis", "goes", "idea"], "polarity": 0.07269919269919271, "subjectivity": 0.43285187785187784},

Alex Bowman, 24, who replaced Earnhardt in the No. 88 car for Hendrick Motorsports, will start the Daytona 500 from the pole position.

A graduate of Nascar\u2019s Drive for Diversity program, Darrell Wallace Jr., 24, could give stock car racing something it has never had before: an African-American star.\n\nBut that is not why Richard Petty brought Wallace onto his team. Late last season, Wallace, who goes by the nickname Bubba, got four rides with Richard Petty Motorsports. It was enough for Petty, one of Nascar\u2019s most iconic names, to not only give Wallace a full-time ride, but also to give him his famed No. 43 racecar to drive. Wallace is the first African-American to drive full-time in the top Nascar series since Wendell Scott in 1971.\n\nPetty insisted, though, that he is colorblind when it comes to evaluating talent. Sure, it would be great if Wallace brings the sport into the African-American community, but as far as Petty is concerned, that\u2019s secondary.\n\n\u201cI hope he advances us as a race team,\u201d Petty said in an email. \u201cI care about what Bubba can do behind the wheel for us. The rest, there are a lot of eyes on Bubba, but he\u2019s handling it well. I know come Sunday he\u2019ll be ready to get into a racecar and just show his talent. If he does well, the rest will come and he\u2019ll grow our fan base.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThose eyes on Wallace, much as they were on Tiger Woods a generation ago, prompted Earnhardt to call him last week.

But there\u2019s also venturing out into a different market, into different avenues where the African-American culture lives. We all have to do better at that.\u201d\n\nThere are challenges, of course. On social media, where vulgar epithets can be spewed from faceless and fictitious monikers, Wallace has, at times, had to think twice before responding. He admits he has not always been successful.\n\n\u201cThere is always going to be haters out there, people who don\u2019t want to see you succeed,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been told that since Day 1 from my parents. Just keep your head down and keep moving, that\u2019s the best you can do.\u201d\n\nBlaney, his closest friend on the circuit, has been around Wallace when offensive remarks have been made.\n\n\u201cThankfully, it\u2019s very, very rare, but it upsets me,\u201d Blaney said. \u201cBubba\u2019s great at handling it. He\u2019s an amazing ambassador for the sport. And he\u2019s really talented and a heck of a competitor. All of us are competitive, but his competitiveness is unlike anyone I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\nNascar\u2019s diversity has become an issue again after its only female racer, Danica Patrick, announced she will retire from the circuit after the Daytona 500. But Wallace is not the only driver who can energize an overlooked community. What he can do for an African-American audience, Su\u00e1rez can do for the Latino market. A native of Monterrey, Mexico, Su\u00e1rez said he had noticed an uptick in social media messages from a variety of Latino countries.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s usually either people who tell me they\u2019re now following the sport because of me, or they\u2019ve been fans and now they have a driver to root for,\u201d said Su\u00e1rez, who is also a graduate of the Drive for Diversity program. \u201cThe potential is huge. This is the most diverse country in the world, but we have to improve diversity in Nascar. If we can make the sport more diverse, we\u2019ll see the same thing with fans.

He became senior editor there in 1958 and later executive editor. He worked for the magazine into his 80s.\n\n\u201cBefore the Mayflower\u201d established Mr. Bennett as a leading scholarly voice during the racial ferment of the 1960s.

Townships have gotten electricity and more modern housing. Government contracts have been set aside for black would-be entrepreneurs.\n\nThese programs have had an impact, improving material conditions and generating jobs.\n\nThey have also been riddled with corruption.\n\nPhoto\n\nAt local governments across South Africa, bureaucrats have abused their authority to steer contracts to companies that put cash in their pockets. At every level of society, people have grown accustomed to kickbacks and political connections determining who prospers, and who goes without.\n\nMr. Zuma\u2019s demise resonates as a sign of a potential new order taking shape. He will forever be linked to his association with the Guptas, three Indian-born brothers who effectively bought key levers of governmental power, amassing influence so comprehensive that it became known as \u201cstate capture.\u201d\n\nHis resignation has raised hopes that South Africa is finally contending with its epidemic of corruption. That view gained momentum when an elite police unit raided a home belonging to the Guptas nearly at the same moment that Mr. Ramaphosa was assuming office.\n\nThe new president is a hero of the anti-apartheid struggle, a former deputy president and chairman of the National Planning Commission, a focal point for thinking about how to engineer economic growth. As a former trade union leader and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Mr. Mandela, he enjoys credibility among a range of interest groups, while carrying a reputation as a savvy and strategic operator.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe has had his brushes with controversy, most notably after a 2012 police massacre of striking platinum miners that killed 34 people. At the time, Mr. Ramaphosa occupied a seat on the board of Lonmin, the company that owned the mine. Emails soon surfaced showing that, a day before the police opened fire, Mr. Ramaphosa had been urging senior government officials to take strong action to end the strike.\n\nPhoto\n\nStill, no corruption charges have stuck to the new president, who now claims a mandate to clean up the toxic mess left behind by Mr. Zuma.\n\nSome doubt whether the A.N.C. can be salvaged as an effective vehicle for egalitarian policymaking. The party\u2019s executive ranks include many figures implicated in corruption. Mr. Ramaphosa, 65, may champion new initiatives aimed at generating economic growth, yet he finds himself relying on his party brethren to execute his visions, with no certainty that the money will land where intended.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t necessarily think that taking the president out does much to dismantle the patronage network,\u201d said Ayabonga Cawe, a development economist at Xesibe Holdings, a research and advisory firm in Johannesburg. \u201cYou\u2019re going to need a lot more than taking out the guy at the top.\u201d\n\nAbove all, Mr. Ramaphosa must contend with the structural defects that have long constrained South Africa\u2019s economy, a legacy of apartheid.\n\nBeyond its systemic discrimination against black people, apartheid severed the country from much of the global economy. It ensured that huge numbers of uneducated black South Africans were available at poverty-level wages within major sectors of the economy like mining, agriculture and textiles. That cushioned domestic companies from the pressure to modernize.\n\nPhoto\n\nInternational sanctions isolated South Africa, shielding its firms from competition against multinational rivals. Sanctions also denied South African companies the ability to operate abroad, giving them an incentive to focus on the domestic market. The apartheid-era government obliged with subsidies for favored firms while allowing companies to pursue oligopoly, free of nuisances like antitrust law.\n\nThe result was a system in which large industries, from retail to furniture-making to chemicals, were dominated by huge enterprises whose core strength was the ability to protect themselves against competition.

The aggressive pace of deportations of immigrants of color, the elimination of the DACA program protecting immigrant children and the proposals propounded by the anti-immigration voices in the administration will all have the undeniable effect of slowing the rapid racial diversification of the United States population. Despite this sweeping attempt at racial social engineering, few voices in progressive and Democratic circles are responding with the kinds of outrage that one would expect.\n\nThe pro-white preferences of Donald Trump and his administration, especially when it comes to immigration, are legion. From the day he opened his presidential campaign in 2015 by demonizing Mexicans to the enthusiasm generated by the calls for building a wall along the Mexican border to aggressively ramping up deportations of immigrants of color to eliminating DACA to vulgarly denigrating African nations and Haiti, this administration has been quite clear about its preference for white people.\n\nIt should be no surprise, then, that the immigration policies championed by the White House would all have the effect of reducing the number of people of color coming into the country. A recent study by The Washington Post found that the administration\u2019s proposals to curtail legal immigration by limiting family reunification would slightly delay the date when whites become a minority. \u201cBy greatly slashing the number of Hispanic and black African immigrants entering America, this proposal would reshape the future United States,\u201d the economist Michael Clemens said.\n\n\u201cDecades ahead,\u201d he added, \u201cmany fewer of us would be nonwhite or have nonwhite people in our families.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe administration\u2019s focus is not random. Nor is it illogical, if one\u2019s goal is to maximize the influence of white people. Since the passage of the 1965 Immigration and Naturalization Act, the chromatic composition of the country\u2019s population has undergone a fundamental transformation. People of color used to make up 12 percent of the United States population in 1965, and that percentage has more than tripled over the past several decades to the point where nonwhite people are nearly 39 percent of the residents of the United States (it is no accident that the country\u2019s first African-American president was elected when he was elected). Mr. Trump\u2019s team understands that the specific laws it seeks to eliminate have played a significant role in that demographic revolution.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

The very first immigration law passed, the Naturalization Act of 1790, declared that to become a citizen, one had to be a \u201cfree white person.\u201d That demarcation was the explicit law of the land for the next 162 years, until 1952. There are 20th-century Supreme Court cases explicitly holding that Asian immigrants could not become United States citizens because they were not white. Even after 1952, the practical effect of immigration policy continued to promote white people above others through mechanisms such as the Asia Pacific Triangle, which restricted immigration from Asian countries.", "keywords": ["color", "sign", "wants", "states", "trump", "america", "white", "population", "nonwhite", "immigration", "immigrants", "united", "effect"], "polarity": 0.07678771845438513, "subjectivity": 0.2882194965528299},

Almost all of those who led the campaign to bring him to account were black, like Thuli Madonsela, the former public protector, who played a heroic role in exposing Mr. Zuma\u2019s corruption. South Africa\u2019s judiciary, which is majority black, defended the independence of the courts with extraordinary courage and under great pressure. After this display of black courage, why would it matter what white people think?\n\nBut South Africa is too fraught and complex a place for such a simple story to ring true. More plausible is that each pinprick penetrating Mr. Zuma\u2019s skin is felt by black South Africans, even those who are horrified by what he has done.\n\nBeneath the surface of public life, one can detect a strange, subliminal to-and-fro. Last year, for instance, a superb book describing in meticulous detail the deep corruption of the late apartheid years, \u201cApartheid Guns and Money,\u201d by Hennie van Vuuren, was a runaway best seller. It deserved to be widely read, but the scale of its success is partly a function of its utility as a weapon against white arrogance. \u201cHowever bad Zuma is,\u201d its many black readers could say to themselves, \u201cyou people were worse.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

For the truth is that Mr. Zuma and his allies were corrupt partly because they felt a sense of grievance intimately connected to their experience of race.\n\nWhen Mr. Zuma became president of South Africa in 2009, he rallied behind him an alliance of people who felt themselves to be marginal and neglected, not just in relation to the world economic order or white South Africa but also in relation to the A.N.C. itself. The A.N.C. has been run by people drawn from the ranks of an urbane, cosmopolitan elite.\n\nMr. Zuma represented a dramatic change in this tradition. Although he spent years in exile and climbed the ranks of the A.N.C., his biography was unlike any of his predecessors\u2019. Nelson Mandela was born into royalty. Thabo Mbeki was the son of prominent intellectuals. Mr. Zuma\u2019s mother worked in the kitchen of a white family and was too poor to provide her son with a formal education. He grew up herding cattle in the hinterland.\n\nWhen he came to power in 2009, he did so with the support of organizations representing much of the urban working class \u2014 the country\u2019s largest trade union and the South African Communist Party.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut he soon dropped these organizations and turned for support to rural South Africa, in particular to traditional leaders and to the elites of far-flung provincial capitals. They carried with them into power an abiding sense of powerlessness, a feeling that the very institutions they now controlled were alien and belonged to others. In office, they believed that they had entered into their enemy\u2019s mansion. It seemed to be payback time.\n\nIn a speech delivered to a room of black businesspeople in December 2016, Mr. Zuma warned of the sophisticated ways in which the enemy confuses black people. One source of such confusion was the prevailing economic orthodoxy. Mr. Zuma suggested that the most fundamental of economic laws was merely nominal; remove the scales from our eyes and we see that so-called economic laws are a ruse invented by the powerful.\n\nHis genre of criminality is light-years from the sort that characterized the apartheid state. The corruption of apartheid\u2019s leaders stemmed from arrogance; they believed that they could control the world forever. Mr. Zuma\u2019s corruption stems from the grievances of a man who feels very small.\n\nThis sense of grievance was on display in the last words he uttered publicly as president. In a swipe at his successor, Mr. Ramaphosa, Mr. Zuma suggested that those in the party who had unseated him were \u201cserving the interests of the oppressors of yesteryear, who joyfully celebrate as we lynch one another.\u201d\n\nBlack nationalism in South Africa has many faces. Mr. Ramaphosa represents a strand that is bourgeois, worldly and comfortable with power. There is also a militant, socialist strand of black nationalism, but it is on the wane. And there is the strand represented by Mr. Zuma, who governed as a man shaped and distorted by the violence and oppression of white supremacy.\n\nI am of course alive to the irony of a white South African like me saying that a black president\u2019s corruption was motivated by racial grievance. Many South Africans, black and white, would regard this argument as an excuse for the intolerable. But we should be honest enough to accept that even now, notwithstanding that apartheid has been gone since before nearly half the South African population was born, the legacy of white supremacy has lived on in the man who was president.", "keywords": ["jacob", "corruption", "africa", "mr", "apartheid", "zumas", "white", "mess", "whats", "black", "south", "economic", "zuma", "distinctive"], "polarity": 0.0616115067727971, "subjectivity": 0.37158776707163793},

Evenly lit, crisply photographed, they look like pictures from an illustrated medical dictionary, indexical images of heads, torsos and mouths that are detached from context. Even in a work like \u201cFigure\u201d (1991), the figure in question, sheathed in a black dress and set in the black infinity of no particular place, feels like a fragment, as though she had been extracted from a group photo or a furnished room. The texts accompanying her, eight engraved plastic plaques, read like excerpts from a language primer: \u201cfigured the worst,\u201d \u201che was disfigured,\u201d \u201cfigured there would be no reaction\u201d and so on. Here, not only has the story been winnowed down; it is in fact completely gone. There\u2019s no story. We are left with only the tensions of concrete poetry.\n\nSometime in the mid-1990s, Simpson began to detect clich\u00e9d responses to her work. At the same time, her own thinking was evolving. What does an image of a black woman mean? A commentary on race? An assertion about gender? Simpson branched out from figure-based images and began to experiment more with varied subject matter \u2014 landscapes and inanimate objects like wigs \u2014 and also with unusual quasi-sculptural material like felt and standing screens. A series of monumental multisectional images, several of them landscapes, collectively titled \u201cPublic Sex\u201d (1995-1998) and featuring no figures at all, addressed the provocative title only obliquely. These pictures, made over many years, contain what the scholar and curator Okwui Enwezor calls \u201cthe rumor of the body.\u201d Mysteries of a jagged and deadpan sort, they would go on to influence the noirish tone of Simpson\u2019s later film work.\n\nPhoto\n\nSimpson began to set ever more intricate conceptual layers between her initial inspiration for a work and the finished product. The idea for \u201c9 Props\u201d (1995) began during a residency at the Pilchuck Glass School in Washington. With the aid of artisans at the school, she fabricated a series of dark vessels modeled on vases and other objects used in the portrait work of the pioneering Harlem photographer James Van Der Zee. But these vessels were not the final work. She shipped them back to New York and then photographed them against a plain background. And that still was not the work. Further intervention followed: She turned those photographic images into nine lithographs, which she printed on felt. Finally, she wrote captions below each lithographed vessel, describing the context in which it originally appeared. One of them, for instance, reads:\n\nDinner Party with boxer Harry Wills, 1926 James VanDerZee Harry Wills a k a \u201cThe Black Panther,\u201d boxer, businessman- sits with seven other men and women, mostly women with champagne glasses raised as a woman on his left makes a toast in his honor. There are three bottles of champagne, a crystal decanter, a bottle of port, an arrangement of flowers and fruit, and before each guest an untouched china place setting.\n\nPhoto\n\nFrom multiple directions, the work gestures at what cannot be seen: the original placement of the vessels that inspired Simpson\u2019s own, the people in the photographs by James Van Der Zee, the social life of Harlem evoked by his photographs and the complexity of manners and class implied by them. All that vanished world of culture and experience is reduced to an elegant grid, as simple as an antiquarian\u2019s catalog, a thought picture that demands calm engagement and imaginative intervention on the viewer\u2019s part. Without being representational, it is about race; but race is not off in some category by itself, hemmed in only by questions of skin color, separate from life.\n\n\u201cRepresent!\u201d in the black American sense means standing up for your people, expressing solidarity and letting a shared ethos underwrite your presence and work. It is an exhortation, a greeting and a farewell. The word also has more conventional associations. In the visual arts, it is contrasted with the abstract or the symbolic. To represent, in this more common sense, is to make work that visually corresponds to realities out there in the world: to illustrate uncomplicatedly. This second sense of \u201crepresent\u201d is enjoying a vogue in the art world. Realism is back. This is welcome: after so long an absence of black figures and black faces in art museums, they are now being seen more frequently. Many artists, black and otherwise, are depicting the black body. It is necessary and often successful. Just as often, it fails when it is little more than a clumsy shorthand for socially concerned art, unobjectionable and unimpressive.\n\nA strong appeal of Simpson\u2019s work is that she has always embraced the inherent complexity of blackness, her own blackness as well as the blackness that runs ineluctably through American history. She does not reject representational depictions, but neither does she feel the need to confine herself only to \u201crace\u201d work. When an artist uses a black model, she is presenting a human question by foregrounding a human presence. Is a white man a person while a black woman is and can only be a gendered and racialized subject? As the scholar Kellie Jones has pointed out, nonwhite bodies are often thought of as \u201cnot neutral enough for the dispassionate formulas thought to constitute conceptual practice.\u201d If a black woman\u2019s race and gender are the only things apparent to certain viewers, Simpson seems to say, the ethical responsibility to escape those shackles is the viewer\u2019s.\n\nFreedom is Lorna Simpson\u2019s starting point and her permanent theme. A humane current animates all of her work, a current that neither sidesteps nor confines itself to race. Her work is simultaneously about the \u201cneutral\u201d space of ideas and the particularized experience of the body. \u201cMontage\u201d is photographic and painterly, a riff on a pair of found photographs, sequenced to look like a giant strip of film. It deals with dreams and nightmares, ambiguities and vulnerabilities. At its heart is what Simpson calls \u201cthe push and pull of photography\u201d: the stuttering potential inherent in mechanical reproduction and the imperfect registrations that mirror subconscious life. It is a rapid response to the current political climate, situating a crucial part of it in the most intimate space of all, where the hectoring \u201cthey\u201d is temporarily held at bay in favor of the puzzled \u201cI.\u201d In your own sleeping bed, images persist and words are hard to come by. It is the art we need now: rich, allusive, tongue-tied and unanswerable.", "keywords": ["images", "seen", "work", "began", "race", "simpson", "woman", "simpsons", "world", "black", "evoking", "art", "cant"], "polarity": 0.06682087932087931, "subjectivity": 0.4861752986752985},

To some extent, there\u2019s always been an adversarial role between the White House and reporters. How do you feel about the tenor of things now? It used to be friendly-adversarial. There would be retaliation for stories they didn\u2019t like, but nothing compared with this. There\u2019s a war going on.

When you open up a press briefing to see the back and forth, you\u2019re getting more in the weeds of what\u2019s going on, beyond just the quote we may put in the story. This is a key piece that I don\u2019t think people really get: When you talk about the press, it\u2019s not about journalists; it\u2019s about the free-flowing information that the American public is supposed to get. When you bash the press, you\u2019re bashing the idea of getting truth out.\n\nWhat\u2019s the public opinion of the White House press corps? It depends on whom you talk to. We\u2019re so tribal now. There used to be a day when you didn\u2019t know the person\u2019s politics. The line has been obscured between facts and opinion. I think it started during the Clinton years, and it just kept getting progressively worse.

The last time I was really caught off guard was when Sarah Huckabee Sanders said something about people\u2019s minds being in the gutter after President Trump\u2019s tweet about Kirsten Gillibrand. I really get into those briefings. I really try to listen. I don\u2019t play to the camera. I go in there, and I\u2019m really earnest. So when she said that, I was shocked! I was like, No, God, that was a little bit much.\n\nGiven how much you tangle with this particular administration, why do you think you get called on so much? Have you felt like a target? Yes, I have. But I have to shake that off, because I have to go in and do my job. I cover the White House. I cover all issues, particularly those that affect black and brown Americans.

It\u2019s not been one thing. It\u2019s been a pattern. So I asked. He did not answer, which I thought was a wasted moment.

He has tried to explain some of that history to his 7-year-old daughter, but without delving too deeply into complex concepts like Western imperialism, which she may struggle to grasp.\n\n\u201cYou want that white kid to be able to think that he can dress up in a Black Panther costume, because, to that kid, there\u2019s no difference between Captain America and Black Panther,\u201d Mr. Narcisse, 45, said. But, he added, it also involves \u201ctrying to explain what is special about T\u2019Challa and Wakanda without racism. And it\u2019s like, \u2018Can\u2019t do it.\u2019 I couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAccording to the ticketing site Fandango, \u201cBlack Panther\u201d set a record among Marvel films for the most advance tickets sold in a 24-hour period. It\u2019s projected to make a record-breaking $165 million over Presidents\u2019 Day weekend and comparisons to last year\u2019s \u201cWonder Woman\u201d bode well for its reception and impact, particularly for black people.\n\n\u201cWhite people have the privilege of not constantly being reminded of their race in the United States, where white is the majority, whereas as a black person you don\u2019t,\u201d Ms. Vittrup said. She believes that parents in general, and white parents in particular, are reluctant to talk about race with young children. When they do, they often miss the chance to talk about inequality, even though research supports the idea that children develop an awareness of race and difference at a very young age.\n\nMs. Vittrup was careful to add that dressing as Black Panther isn\u2019t inherently appropriative or offensive. The character comes from an invented African country, and to wear his mask isn\u2019t quite the same as wearing blackface. However, in a moment where even more black heroes, like Luke Cage and Black Lightning, are finding their way into the limelight, Black Panther\u2019s relationship with the black community and its history creates an opportunity to teach nonblack children about the black experience.\n\n\u201cKids are not colorblind,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of structural inequality in our society, and kids are noticing that. By not mentioning it, by not talking about it, we\u2019re essentially preserving the status quo.\u201d", "keywords": ["kid", "york", "panther", "race", "think", "dress", "panthers", "characters", "white", "meanings", "black", "mask", "history"], "polarity": 0.05700972543438296, "subjectivity": 0.3779504437723616},
{"title": "\n                    Obama Portraits Blend Paint and Politics, and Fact and Fiction                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/12/arts/design/obama-portrait.html", "text": "There are, for sure, outstanding things, one being Gilbert Stuart\u2019s so-called \u201cLansdowne\u201d Portrait\u201d of George Washington from 1796, a full-length likeness packed with executive paraphernalia: papers to be signed, multiple quill pens, a sword, and an Imperial Roman-style chair. Even the clothes are an 18th-century version of current POTUS style: basic black suit and fat tie. As for Washington, he stands blank-faced, one arm extended, like a tenor taking a dignified bow.\n\n[Read remarks from the Obamas and the artists. ]\n\nUninflected dignity was the attitude of choice for well over a century, with a few breaks. In an 1836 portrait, Andrew Jackson, a demonstrative bully, sports a floor-length, red-silk-lined Dracula cloak and a kind of topiary bouffant. (A picture of Jackson, one of President Trump\u2019s populist heroes, hangs in the Oval Office.) Abraham Lincoln, seen in several likenesses, is exceptional for looking as if he may actually have weighty matters on his mind. Most of the portraits that precede and follow his are pure P.R.\n\nThis continues well into the 20th century. In a 1980 painting Jimmy Carter trades a black suit for a beige one. How revolutionary is that? And there\u2019s a Casual Fridays vogue: Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush both go tieless for it. Under the circumstances, Elaine de Kooning\u2019s 1963 portrait of John F. Kennedy, a fanfare of green and blue strokes, hits like a boost of adrenaline. Rousing too, though not in a good way, is a big head shot image of Bill Clinton by the artist Chuck Close. Using his signature mosaic-like painting technique, Mr. Close turns the 42nd president into a pixelated clown.\n\nMr. Obama has much better luck with his similarly high-profile portraitist. Mr. Wiley, born in Los Angeles in 1977, gained a following in the early 2000s with his crisp, glossy, life-size paintings of young African-American men dressed in hip-hop styles, but depicted in the old-master manner of European royal portraits. More recently he has expanded his repertoire to include female subjects, as well as models from Brazil, India, Nigeria and Senegal, creating the collective image of a global black aristocracy.\n\nIn an imposingly scaled painting \u2014 just over seven feet tall \u2014 the artist presents Mr. Obama dressed in the regulation black suit and an open-necked white shirt, and seated on a vaguely thronelike chair not so different from the one seen in Stuart\u2019s Washington portrait. But art historical references stop there. So do tonal echoes of past portraits. Whereas Mr. Obama\u2019s predecessors are, to the man, shown expressionless and composed, Mr. Obama sits tensely forward, frowning, elbows on his knees, arms crossed, as if listening hard. No smiles, no Mr. Nice Guy. He\u2019s still troubleshooting, still in the game.\n\nVideo\n\nHis engaged and assertive demeanor contradicts \u2014 and cosmetically corrects \u2014 the impression he often made in office of being philosophically detached from what was going on around him. At some level, all portraits are propaganda, political or personal. And what makes this one distinctive is the personal part. Mr. Wiley has set Mr. Obama against \u2014 really embedded him in \u2014 a bower of what looks like ground cover. From the greenery sprout flowers that have symbolic meaning for the sitter. African blue lilies represent Kenya, his father\u2019s birthplace; jasmine stands for Hawaii, where Mr. Obama himself was born; chrysanthemums, the official flower of Chicago, reference the city where his political career began, and where he met his wife.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMrs. Obama\u2019s choice of Ms. Sherald as an artist was an enterprising one. Ms. Sherald, who was born in Columbus, Ga., in 1973 and lives in Baltimore, is just beginning to move into the national spotlight after putting her career on hold for some years to deal with a family health crisis, and one of her own. (She had a heart transplant at 39.) Production-wise, she and Mr. Wiley operate quite differently. He runs the equivalent of a multinational art factory, with assistants churning out work. Ms. Sherald, who until a few years ago made her living waiting tables, oversees a studio staff of one, herself.\n\nAt the same time, they have much in common. Both focused early on African-American portraiture precisely because it is so little represented in Western art history. And both tend to blend fact and fiction. Mr. Wiley, with photo-realistic precision, casts actual people in fantastically heroic roles. (He modifies his heroizing in the case of Mr. Obama, but it\u2019s still there.) Ms. Sherald also starts with realism, but softens and abstracts it. She gives all her figures gray-toned skin \u2014 a color with ambiguous racial associations \u2014 and reduces bodies to geometric forms silhouetted against single-color fields.\n\nShe shows Mrs. Obama sitting against a field of light blue, wearing a spreading gown. The dress design, by Michelle Smith, is eye-teasingly complicated: mostly white interrupted by black Op Art-ish blips and patches of striped color suggestive of African textiles. The shape of the dress, rising pyramidally upward, mountain-like, feels as if it were the real subject of the portrait. Mrs. Obama\u2019s face forms the composition\u2019s peak, but could be almost anyone\u2019s face, like a model\u2019s face in a fashion spread. To be honest, I was anticipating \u2014 hoping for \u2014 a bolder, more incisive image of the strong-voiced person I imagine this former first lady to be.\n\nAnd while I\u2019m wishing, let me mention something more. Mr. Obama\u2019s portrait will be installed, long-term, among those of his presidential peers, in a dedicated space on the second floor. Mrs. Obama\u2019s will hang in a corridor reserved for temporary displays of new acquisitions \u2014 on the first floor. It will stay there until November, after which there\u2019s no set-aside place for it to land.\n\nIf first men have an acknowledged showcase, first women \u2014 ladies or not \u2014 should too. Better, they should all be together, sharing space, offering a welcoming environment to, among others, a future first female president, and creating a lasting monument to #MeToo.", "keywords": ["ms", "portraits", "politics", "sherald", "obama", "black", "mr", "wiley", "washington", "paint", "fiction", "portrait", "fact", "blend", "obamas"], "polarity": 0.07208600786186993, "subjectivity": 0.35921572042261696},

The U.S.O.C. does not release data on other racial and ethnic groups because the national governing bodies for individual sports collect and report the data and have done so inconsistently (the sports ask but do not require athletes to report their racial and ethnic identities).\n\nJason Thompson, the director of diversity and inclusion at the committee, said progress has been made in fielding a more diverse team, but that more needs to be done to recruit athletes across racial and ethnic groups.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re not where we want to be,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it\u2019s a huge jump to show that winter sports are for everybody.\u201d\n\nThe sports that have seen the biggest increase in racial diversity are those drawing so-called crossover athletes \u2014 those talented in one sport who adapt to a new one.\n\n\u201cSometimes it\u2019s just that they haven\u2019t been introduced to the sport,\u201d Thompson said.
