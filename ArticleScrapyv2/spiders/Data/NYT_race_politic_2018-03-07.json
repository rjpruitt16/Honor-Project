I was right during the election campaign by relying on my instinct. I\u2019ll do the same in office.\u2019\u201d\n\nSenator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic minority leader, said that Mr. Cohn\u2019s decision to resign demonstrated that Mr. Trump\u2019s White House could not assemble a coherent team that could navigate the political and policy challenges that face a president.\n\n\u201cOne of the problems here is the White House is getting hollowed out and the number of people capable of doing things, of doing real things whether you agree or disagree ideologically, is getting smaller and smaller,\u201d Mr. Schumer told reporters. \u201cSo the mess-ups we\u2019ve seen this past week,\u201d he added, \u201cI think we\u2019re going to see over and over and over again.\u201d\n\nThe White House pointed the finger the other direction later in the day, accusing Mr. Schumer of blocking the confirmation of many officials nominated by Mr. Trump for no other reason than partisan politics.\n\n\u201cSenator Schumer is blocking nominees indiscriminately,\u201d said Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary. \u201cHe forces time-wasting procedural votes on nominees and then eventually votes in support of them.\u201d She added, \u201cIt\u2019s a disgrace, it\u2019s dangerous and it must come to an end.\u201d\n\nMany of the recent departures, however, have come from the White House staff, which does not require Senate confirmation. Mr. Cohn announced this week that he would step down after losing a fractious internal battle over imposing tariffs. Many White House officials anticipate that some of his top aides will end up leaving as well.\n\nHis resignation came soon after Hope Hicks, the president\u2019s communications director and confidant, said she would leave in the next few weeks and Rob Porter, the White House staff secretary who was part of the inner circle, resigned under pressure amid allegations of spousal abuse by two former wives.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe 43 percent turnover rate calculated by Kathryn Dunn Tenpas, a scholar at the Brookings Institution, far outpaces that of any first-year presidency in the last four decades. And many assume that it will rise even higher soon amid talk that John F. Kelly, the chief of staff; Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, the national security adviser; or even Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, might leave.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Few of the original team remain in place; among the survivors are Kellyanne Conway, the president\u2019s counselor, and Stephen Miller, his senior policy adviser.\n\nMs. Conway said she frequently reminded colleagues that they served at the pleasure of the president. \u201cThere are only two people in the building that were elected to anything,\u201d she said she told other staff members. \u201cIf you don\u2019t hear your name on the list, get with the program or get out \u2014 Donald J. Trump and Michael Pence.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump has long brought new people in and then cast others out in a perpetual cycle of advisers. The few with staying power tend to be members of the family, although even those who are exiled often stay in his orbit in some fashion. The president, several people close to him said this week, is increasingly running the Oval Office the way he ran his 26th-floor office at Trump Tower, with teams broken into small groups visiting him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously very different from most presidents but it\u2019s how Trump has operated,\u201d said Andy Surabian, a former special assistant to Mr. Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s someone who likes getting different opinions thrown at him. It\u2019s a fascinating thing for a guy who\u2019s very hardened on certain issues. But I view it as a big positive for him.\u201d\n\nRoger J. Stone Jr., Mr. Trump\u2019s longest-serving political hand, said that the changes in staff were ultimately \u201ca good thing because I think that\u2019s how you get back Trumpism. The people who are leaving are the people who are telling him you can\u2019t do this, the people who would dilute the platform on which he was elected.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump has rebuffed concerns from allies and advisers about the tariffs, saying that he is right and that he believes he will be proven so. He has excoriated Mr. Cohn privately for choosing to leave.\n\nMr. Stone said that working in Mr. Trump\u2019s favor is that \u201che\u2019s extraordinarily stubborn. When he sets his mind to do something \u2014 for instance, utilize the threat of tariffs against those are utilizing tariffs against us \u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter who his advisers are. He knows his own mind on this.\u201d\n\nAt a news conference this week, Mr. Trump made clear that he thrived on the constant churning and hinted that there will be more departures soon, but he rejected the idea that he had trouble recruiting new people to work for him because \u201cthe White House has tremendous energy.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThere will be people that change,\u201d he said. \u201cThey always change. Sometimes they want to go out and do something else. But they all want to be in the White House. So many people want to come in, I have a choice of anybody. I could take any position in the White House and I\u2019ll have a choice of the 10 top people having to do with that position.\u201d\n\nStill, even Mr. Trump has taken to joking about the revolving door lately. At the annual Gridiron Dinner last weekend with politicians and figures in the news media, he said, \u201cI like chaos,\u201d and called the turnover \u201cinvigorating.\u201d\n\nAlmost as if he were previewing the next episode of a show, he added, \u201cWho\u2019s going to be the next to leave?

His bill would allow 100,000 public schools to use federal dollars for school counselors, alarm systems, security cameras and crisis intervention training.\n\nEducation Secretary Betsy DeVos threw her weight behind what she said was the only approach that could muster broad support after a brief but contentious visit on Wednesday to Stoneman Douglas High School, where 17 students and faculty were gunned down on Valentine\u2019s Day.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s an opportunity to take some practical steps that many, many people agree on and continue pushing forward on things that have broad support,\u201d she said.\n\nBut as the midterm election season begins, the school safety votes may only be an opening volley.\n\n\u201cThe Republicans would like to have the public think they\u2019re doing something and have the N.R.A. think they\u2019re doing nothing,\u201d said Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 Democrat in the House.\n\nGun control has long been one of the most divisive and contentious issues in Washington, and the rush to legislate on school safety reflects the difficulty of passing measures that have anything to do with guns. On Wednesday, students advocating gun safety legislation staged a sit-in outside the office of Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, chanting \u201cEnough is enough!\u201d and \u201cNot one more!\u201d Eight were arrested, police said.\n\nBut most gun safety proposals \u2014 including expanding background checks for gun purchases, raising the minimum age for buying rifles to 21 from 18, banning assault-style weapons like the AR-15 used by the gunman in Parkland and taking guns away from people deemed mentally unfit \u2014 appear to be going nowhere on Capitol Hill. President Trump\u2019s mercurial statements have not helped. At a televised White House session, he appeared to back broad gun control legislation, only to muddy his position after an evening meeting with the N.R.A.\u2019s chief lobbyist.\n\nOne exception is the Fix NICS Act, a modest measure that would offer incentives to states and federal agencies to improve reporting to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, for gun purchasers. The measure, which is backed by the N.R.A., has already passed the House and has broad bipartisan support in the Senate.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut even that legislation is facing a hurdle: Mr. McConnell cannot bring it up quickly for a vote because Senate rules require unanimous consent to do so, and at least one senator, Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, has objected. And while Mr. McConnell is a co-sponsor of the Senate\u2019s version of the STOP School Violence Act, he has not said when the Senate will consider it.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Hatch, Republican of Utah, said in an interview Wednesday that his aim was to focus on \u201cspecial programs and special approaches toward making these schools safer and more acceptable to the families and kids.\u201d\n\nAs for Democrats who consider the measure insufficient, Mr. Hatch said: \u201cThat\u2019s their motif every time. I mean, they know that if they can raise hell against guns and so forth, that that gives them a lot of publicity. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily help us in our educational processes.\u201d\n\nSenator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut and a co-sponsor of Mr. Hatch\u2019s bill, said he did not want the Senate to lose sight of more far-reaching legislation that would address gun violence head-on.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a useful bill, but it doesn\u2019t have anything to do with gun laws,\u201d Mr. Murphy said. \u201cAnybody whose only solution to the school shooting epidemic is to make our schools fortresses doesn\u2019t understand the root of this problem.\u201d\n\nRandi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, also welcomed efforts to increase safety measures and resources, but she said legislators and Mr. Trump had used it deflect from the larger demands of the public, including students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas, who had been in the forefront of gun control advocacy since the shooting.\n\n\u201cThe kids from Stoneman Douglas said, \u2018Do certain common-sense, gun violence reduction measures \u2014 don\u2019t change the subject,\u2019\u201d Ms. Weingarten said.\n\nWhile Republicans were talking about school safety, Senate Democrats on Thursday sought to keep the focus on guns. Senators Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, and Bill Nelson of Florida, convened a Democrats-only afternoon hearing to take testimony from those affected by gun violence.\n\nAmong the witnesses were Mr. Guttenberg and David Hogg, a 17-year-old Stoneman Douglas senior who has become a vocal national spokesman for gun control.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn Parkland on Wednesday, Ms. DeVos was greeted less than enthusiastically by many students, who took to social media to complain that she did not have any substantive interactions with them.

Spiro, a law professor at Temple University.\n\nThe California case seems likely to reach the Supreme Court, where it could give rise to a landmark reckoning on the role of states in setting immigration policy. In the process, state and federal officials, along with judges and justices, will face a test of their commitment to consistency.\n\nThey will face stark choices. One is to apply legal principles established in a case that mostly protected immigrants to one that seeks to imperil them. Another is to revise those principles in light of the very different circumstances.\n\nStephen Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas, said history was repeating itself, but backward.\n\n\u201cThe suit is modeled on the Obama administration\u2019s successful suit against Arizona,\u201d he said. But he added that \u201csome of the key considerations are flipped.\u201d\n\nIn the Arizona case, conservatives insisted that respect for state sovereignty required letting states play a leading role in controlling immigration within their borders. But Mr. Sessions, a longtime conservative himself, disavowed that position in his speech on Wednesday. \u201cImmigration law is the province of the federal government,\u201d he said.\n\nJustice Antonin Scalia, the conservative jurist who died in 2016, took a different view of the Arizona case. In an impassioned partial dissent, he wrote that \u201cit is easy to lose sight of the states\u2019 traditional role in regulating immigration \u2014 and to overlook their sovereign prerogative to do so.\u201d\n\nThere is no doubt that the California lawsuit is at odds with some of the Trump administration\u2019s usual positions. \u201cIt\u2019s a fascinating suit on a number of levels,\u201d Professor Vladeck said, \u201cnot the least of which is the aggressive assertion of federal enforcement power directly against states by those, like Attorney General Sessions, who have historically been ardent defenders of states\u2019 rights in the deeply analogous contexts.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCristina Rodriguez, a law professor at Yale, said she detected political parallels between the two suits.\n\n\u201cBoth administrations claim that the state laws they challenge impermissibly interfere with the executive branch\u2019s ability to enforce the immigration laws,\u201d she said. \u201cBut both lawsuits are also clearly designed to take on visible and politically powerful local officials whose vision of immigration policy conflicts with the president\u2019s and his supporters\u2019.\u201d\n\nIn a news conference on Wednesday, Xavier Becerra, the California attorney general, said he was ready for the fight. The state\u2019s laws, he said, were \u201cfully constitutional and provide for the safety and welfare of all our people.\u201d\n\n\u201cCalifornia is in the business of public safety,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not in the business of deportations.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

One restricts employers from cooperating with immigration officials. A second generally prohibits state officials from telling federal ones when undocumented immigrants are to be released from state custody. A third requires state officials to inspect some facilities that house people detained on behalf of the federal government.\n\nJennifer Chacon, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine, said the state laws had been carefully written to avoid direct conflicts with federal immigration laws. \u201cI think it is clear that California deliberately tried to draft laws that involved core exercises of state police power in a way that did not run afoul of federal law,\u201d she said.\n\nEach state law presents different issues, and courts may give varying answers depending on how directly the state laws conflict with federal ones. More generally, though, courts will take account of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in the Arizona case, which called for collaboration rather than conflict.\n\n\u201cConsultation between federal and state officials is an important feature of the immigration system,\u201d Justice Kennedy wrote in the court\u2019s decision in the Arizona case.\n\nGov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, has said that consultation is fine but that federal officials should not use California\u2019s resources to pursue undocumented Californians. The federal government, he added, may do so on its own.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThey are free to use their own considerable resources to enforce federal immigration law in California,\u201d he said in October in signing one of the challenged laws.\n\nThe Supreme Court has said that the federal government may not commandeer state resources to achieve federal objectives. In his speech on Wednesday, Mr. Sessions denied that anything like that was afoot.\n\n\n\n\u201cContrary to what you might hear from the lawless open borders radicals,\u201d he said, \u201cwe are not asking California, Oakland or anyone else to enforce immigration laws.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are simply asking California and other sanctuary jurisdictions to stop actively obstructing federal law enforcement,\u201d he added.\n\nBut Professor Rodriguez said the commandeering issue was a substantial one. \u201cTo the extent the Trump administration\u2019s claims against California would produce an outcome that would effectively force states and localities to participate in immigration enforcement,\u201d she said, \u201cthere could be an unconstitutional commandeering.\u201d\n\nProfessor Spiro said that California may have the upper hand in the suit\u2019s early stages, as the issues in it are novel, leaving judges with substantial discretion.\n\nThe Trump administration has not fared well in federal courts in California in other cases concerning immigration, including ones challenging President Trump\u2019s efforts to restrict travel from predominantly Muslim countries and to rescind a program protecting some 700,000 young unauthorized immigrants from deportation.\n\nBut the ultimate fate of the suit will probably rest with the Supreme Court. In 2012, with what may have been unwarranted optimism, Justice Kennedy said he hoped that conflicts over immigration policy would be worked out through reasoned discussion.\n\n\u201cThe national government has significant power to regulate immigration,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe sound exercise of national power over immigration depends on the nation\u2019s meeting its responsibility to base its laws on a political will informed by searching, thoughtful, rational civic discourse.\u201d", "keywords": ["california", "state", "using", "sessions", "law", "officials", "courts", "laws", "professor", "protected", "targets", "immigration", "federal", "immigrants", "ruling", "states"], "polarity": 0.13091845964980292, "subjectivity": 0.5042437164825224},

And Mr. Trump also told White House officials after Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from the investigation that he needed someone running the Justice Department who would protect him.\n\nThe experts said the meetings with Mr. McGahn and Mr. Priebus would probably sharpen Mr. Mueller\u2019s focus on the president\u2019s interactions with other witnesses. The special counsel has questioned witnesses recently about their interactions with the president since the investigation began. The experts also said the episodes could serve as evidence for Mr. Mueller in an obstruction case.\n\n\u201cIt makes it look like you\u2019re cooking a story, and prosecutors are always looking out for it,\u201d said Julie R. O\u2019Sullivan, a law professor at Georgetown University and expert on white-collar criminal investigations.\n\nShe added, \u201cIt can get at the issue of consciousness of guilt in an obstruction case because if you didn\u2019t do anything wrong, why are you doing that?\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

The president has not been questioned by Mr. Mueller; Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers are negotiating terms of a possible interview. Learning even basic details about what other witnesses told investigators could help the president shape his own answers.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s interactions with Mr. McGahn unfolded in the days after the Jan. 25 Times article, which said that Mr. McGahn threatened to quit last June after the president asked him to fire the special counsel. After the article was published, the White House staff secretary, Rob Porter, told Mr. McGahn that the president wanted him to release a statement saying that the story was not true, the people said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Porter, who resigned last month amid a domestic abuse scandal, told Mr. McGahn the president had suggested he might \u201cget rid of\u201d Mr. McGahn if he chose not to challenge the article, the people briefed on the conversation said.\n\nMr. McGahn did not publicly deny the article, and the president later confronted him in the Oval Office in front of the White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, according to the people.\n\nThe president said he had never ordered Mr. McGahn to fire the special counsel. Mr. McGahn replied that the president was wrong and that he had in fact asked Mr. McGahn in June to call the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, to tell him that the special counsel had a series of conflicts that disqualified him for overseeing the investigation and that he had to be dismissed. The president told Mr. McGahn that he did not remember the discussion that way.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Trump moved on, pointing out that Mr. McGahn had never told him that he was going to resign over the order to fire the special counsel. Mr. McGahn acknowledged that that was true but said that he had told senior White House officials at the time that he was going to quit.\n\nIt is not clear how the confrontation was resolved. Mr. McGahn has stayed on as White House counsel, one of the few senior administration officials who has been with the president since the campaign.\n\nMr. Priebus met with the president in the West Wing in December, according to the people with knowledge of their encounter. Allies of Mr. Priebus, who left the White House in July 2017, have cautioned him to keep his distance. But Mr. Priebus, who is seeking to build a law practice as a Washington power broker who can open doors for clients, has maintained contact and occasionally visited the White House to see Mr. Trump and his own replacement, Mr. Kelly.\n\nMr. Trump brought up Mr. Priebus\u2019s October interview with the special counsel\u2019s office, the people said, and Mr. Priebus replied that the investigators were courteous and professional. He shared no specifics and did not say what he had told investigators, and the conversation moved on after a few minutes, those briefed on it said. Mr. Kelly was present for that conversation as well, and it was not clear whether he tried to stop the discussion.\n\nIt is not illegal for the subject of an investigation to learn what witnesses have told investigators. But that is usually done through lawyers for the people involved because their communications are often shielded from prosecutors because of attorney-client privilege. In organized crime and complex white-collar investigations, prosecutors often ask witnesses whether they have spoken to the person under investigation to determine whether they are coordinating their stories.\n\nMr. Priebus has had a long and complicated relationship with the president. He was one of the few who publicly defended Mr. Trump after the Times article about his attempt to fire Mr. Mueller, which cited the president\u2019s view that Mr. Mueller had too many conflicts to be the special counsel.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cHe expresses concerns with the conflicts, but I never heard the idea or the concept that this person needed to be fired,\u201d Mr. Priebus said last month in an interview on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201cI never felt it was relayed to me that way, either. And I would know the difference between a level 10 situation as reported in that story and what was reality.

There is no nullification, there is no secession. Federal law is the supreme law of the land,\u201d said Mr. Sessions, one of the administration\u2019s most adamant immigration restrictionists. He accused the state of intentionally using \u201cevery power the legislature has to undermine the duly established immigration laws of America.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit, which the Justice Department disclosed on Tuesday in advance of Mr. Sessions\u2019s speech, capped a clash between the Trump administration and California that has lasted more than a year, with each side reaping political profit from the battle. The administration has sought to demonstrate that it will not tolerate noncompliance with federal immigration enforcement; California\u2019s top officials, professed leaders of the anti-Trump resistance, have pushed the state to cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement as little as possible.\n\nEven as Mr. Sessions spoke, that opposition was making itself heard. Outside the hotel where Mr. Sessions was speaking, several hundred protesters marched, holding signs saying \u201cGo Home Jeff\u201d and \u201cCrush ICE\u201d and chanting, \u201cWhat do we want?

The employee records law, Mr. Becerra said, simply ensures that workers and employers are guaranteed \u201ctheir rights and their privacy and that those are being respected.\u201d\n\nAsked whether the law would, in effect, require warning undocumented workers to flee ahead of an ICE visit, Mr. Brown compared the provision to the practice of notifying criminal suspects that they have a right to a lawyer. \u201cWe are just following the law, and the law allows people to be advised of their rights,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cAnything else smacks of a more totalitarian approach to things.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He heartily ripped into Libby Schaaf, the Democratic mayor of Oakland, for issuing a warning last week that ICE planned to arrest immigrants across Northern California, an alert that infuriated agency officials who said her tip-off had allowed hundreds of their targets to slip away.\n\nMs. Schaaf\u2019s actions \u201csupport those who flout the law and boldly validates illegality,\u201d Mr. Sessions said, calling her warning \u201can embarrassment to the proud state of California.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo here\u2019s my message to Mayor Schaaf,\u201d he said. \u201cHow dare you, how dare you needlessly endanger the lives of our law enforcement officers to promote a radical open borders agenda?\u201d\n\nMs. Schaaf said last week that she had not publicized any information that endangered ICE officers. She said she issued the warning because \u201cI know that Oakland is a city of law-abiding immigrants and families who deserve to live free from the constant threat of arrest and deportation.\u201d\n\nInside the hotel ballroom on Wednesday, Mr. Sessions faced a polite, if somewhat divided, audience.\n\nSome police chiefs and sheriffs in liberal-leaning areas have argued that their agencies must distance themselves from ICE to avoid scaring off immigrant residents who may be more reluctant to serve as witnesses or come forward to report crimes. But there are many other officials across the country who say they would prefer to work with ICE if the legal issues surrounding such cooperation are clarified, and some who are eager to help the federal government outright with immigration enforcement.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThose tensions were palpable at Mr. Sessions\u2019s speech, which was hosted by the California Peace Officers Association, a law enforcement advocacy group. The crowd responded to the speech with brief applause; about 10 of the more than 200 officers in the room stood to clap.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m stuck in the middle,\u201d said Deputy Chief Derek Williams of the police department in Ontario, a midsize city east of Los Angeles with a large Hispanic population. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely bifurcated now.\u201d\n\nWhile the new state laws do not affect his work on a day-to-day basis, he said, the sharp increase in ICE activity has fostered \u201ca lack of trust with law enforcement\u201d among immigrant residents. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult time for us,\u201d he said.\n\nAmong those who endorsed Mr. Sessions\u2019s message was Paul R. Curry, a lobbyist for the California Correctional Supervisors Organization, which represents supervisors in the state prison system. He said California police chiefs were often caught between ICE\u2019s requests and the orders of their mayors, who might embrace sanctuary policies.\n\n\u201cEvery police officer is sworn to uphold the law not only of the state but the nation,\u201d Mr. Curry said. \u201cThe progressive agenda is running afoul of the force of our laws in the country.\u201d", "keywords": ["speech", "scolds", "sessions", "state", "law", "ice", "laws", "problem", "enforcement", "immigration", "mr", "federal", "jeff", "california"], "polarity": 0.07449416525503484, "subjectivity": 0.38028734550473675},

Each president has about 4,000 political posts to fill; separately, there are two million civilian federal workers who are largely hired through a competitive process.\n\nJust over a year into his presidency, Mr. Trump has yet to formally nominate candidates for nearly 35 percent of the 639 positions needing Senate confirmation, according to the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit group that tracks federal appointments. Mr. Trump arrived at the White House without a large contingent of well-known Washington names at the ready, and some jobs have been filled with people new to government or lacking experience in the fields where they now work, according to a review of financial disclosures.\n\nNo comparative database exists from previous administrations, but scholars and other experts on presidential transitions say the Trump appointments stand out.\n\n\u201cOverall, my reading is that the Trump political appointees have less expertise, in their respective areas, than any presidential administration dating back to at least the Reagan era,\u201d said Thomas E.

For instance, Heather Nauert, a State Department spokeswoman, said in a statement that Matthew Mowers, the former Trump campaign official who recently traveled to South Africa, provided a \u201cfresh focus and renewed passion for helping women, children and men who are living with H.I.V./AIDS.\u201d\n\nMr. Mowers, who had also worked on the presidential campaign of Chris Christie, the former governor of New Jersey, is chief of staff in the Office of the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator. Last month, he tweeted from South Africa, \u201cGreat meeting today with Ministry of Health Officials in Johannesburg.\u201d\n\nOne of the top sources of the appointees has been the presidential campaign, according to the database. Some of the people listed in the database have already left the Trump administration, but it offers a snapshot of those hired for political jobs in the past year. At the White House alone, there have been almost 60 former campaign workers. In addition, about 20 have been hired at the Energy Department, and another 20 or so at the Commerce Department.\n\nSome of the Commerce jobs have been filled with people who have extensive experience in government or the private sector. One of them is Mira Ricardel, the under secretary for export administration, whose career includes stints at Boeing, at the Defense Department and on Capitol Hill. During the campaign, she was a consultant to Trump for America.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

Jonathan Wardell, the aide in the secretary\u2019s office, graduated in 2016 from Stony Brook University in New York. William Reinert, who works in the public affairs office, graduated from Troy University in Alabama in 2016; his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 cites six months with the Trump campaign and other short-term jobs, including on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe former campaign field worker who now promotes sales of nuclear energy equipment abroad is Cameron Dorsey, a 2014 graduate of Washington and Lee University in Virginia who also worked briefly for the Republican National Committee and a political consulting firm, according to her financial disclosure form.\n\nThe Commerce Department did not comment on the experience level of some of its recent hires. But Secretary Wilbur L. Ross Jr. said in a statement that the department sought the best candidates for positions, adding, \u201cIt is important that young people show interest and get involved in public service.\u201d\n\nAt the State Department, political appointees include Taylor Bush, whose title is listed as special assistant. Mr. Bush was a field director for the campaign in Fairfax, Va., and also worked on the inaugural committee and at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. The only other recent source of income listed on his financial disclosure form was a bartending job at the Hamilton Restaurant in Washington.\n\n\u201cThe work of a special assistant requires someone who has good interpersonal skills, is well organized and who can handle multiple assignments simultaneously,\u201d the State Department spokeswoman said in a statement. \u201cTaylor Bush is a hard worker \u2014 he proved himself in these areas during the campaign and, as a result, was asked to join the State Department.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe former lobbyists who have joined the administration include some who recently lobbied the agencies where they now work. Melissa F. Burnison, for example, was in February confirmed as an assistant secretary for congressional affairs at the Energy Department. As recently as the fourth quarter of last year, Ms. Burnison was involved in lobbying the department on behalf of the Nuclear Energy Institute, which represents the nuclear industry, according to lobbying disclosures.\n\n\n\nAn Energy spokeswoman said Ms. Burnison \u201cwill continue to comply with guidelines, waiver or no waiver.\u201d Without an ethics waiver, she is prohibited from working on issues with which she was previously involved.\n\nThe administration has granted at least 31 waivers to some former lobbyists and others who had private-sector jobs that overlap with their new federal assignments, according to the database. Among them is Erik Baptist, a senior deputy general counsel at the Environmental Protection Agency. He previously worked for the American Petroleum Institute as a lobbyist on federal regulations related to renewable fuels.\n\nThe appointees from conservative research and advocacy groups reflect Mr. Trump\u2019s right-leaning politics.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation tops the list, according to the ProPublica tally, with at least 25 former employees now working for the administration.\n\nNext is Freedom Partners, a nonprofit group led by the general counsel of Koch Industries, with 16 people who were compensated by the organization. They are among about 35 Trump political appointees who worked for or consulted with different groups affiliated with the billionaire libertarian brothers Charles G. and David H. Koch.\n\nThe conservative appointees are spread across the government. At the Interior Department, Ryan Nichols is an adviser in the Office of Water and Science, after coordinating the Heritage Foundation\u2019s work with a group of climate change skeptics called the \u201cCooler Heads Coalition.\u201d Also from the Heritage Foundation is Steven Groves, who works at the White House after writing forcefully against international agreements in collaboration with groups like the United Nations Human Rights Council.\n\nIt is an open question whether the tradition of filling lower-level political jobs with people loyal to the president, or at least grateful for a job, has much influence on policy. After all, the 4,000 positions account for a fraction of 1 percent of the federal work force.\n\n\u201cMost of them were excellent, some not so good,\u201d said Eric L. Hirschhorn, a political appointee in the Commerce Department during much of the Obama administration. Because political appointees are not subject to civil service rules, he added, there was one advantage if they did not meet expectations. \u201cIt was a lot easier to get rid them,\u201d he said.", "keywords": ["doled", "allies", "worked", "appointees", "political", "administration", "department", "jobs", "campaign", "workers", "according", "federal", "trump", "spoils"], "polarity": 0.08284131834552001, "subjectivity": 0.29429499072356224},

After Mr. Thiel spoke at the Republican National Convention in 2016, there were unsourced media reports that said Mr. Trump wanted to put him on the Supreme Court. But now even photo ops are rare.\n\nThe investor said he had last spoken to the president \u201ca few months ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t talk that often,\u201d he said, but added, \u201cI can get access anytime I want.\u201d\n\nThe Trump whom Mr. Thiel touted at the Republican convention was a candidate who would \u201cend the era of stupid wars and rebuild our country,\u201d move us past \u201cfake culture wars\u201d and start projects the equivalent of the Apollo space program. That does not seem to be the president he got.\n\n\u201cThere are all these ways that things have fallen short,\u201d Mr. Thiel said. But he said he had no regrets about his endorsement. \u201cIt\u2019s still better than Hillary Clinton or the Republican zombies,\u201d he said, referring to the other candidates.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMr. Thiel is routinely labeled a libertarian. On a bookshelf in the apartment, as if in confirmation, is a hardback copy of Ayn Rand\u2019s \u201cAtlas Shrugged,\u201d the bible of the movement. A gift, he said.\n\nA lesser-known but possibly deeper influence was the French philosopher Ren\u00e9 Girard, who taught at Stanford University when Mr. Thiel was an undergraduate there. For 15 years, on and off, Mr. Thiel sat in on a study group about Mr. Girard\u2019s ideas. Mr. Girard believed human beings were deeply mimetic, which is to say they copy one another.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very anti-Ayn Rand: There are no self-contained autonomous figures,\u201d Mr. Thiel said. \u201cOur desires are not our own. They get shaped powerfully by the society around us.\u201d\n\nIt was this illumination that helped him see the potential of Facebook \u2014 where people could find out in intimate and addictive detail what their friends were up to \u2014 when it was barely a year old. He was the first outside investor, buying 10 percent of the company for $500,000.\n\nHe sold most of his holdings in 2012 as Facebook went public. A few months ago, with Facebook\u2019s market capitalization at about $500 billion, he sold most of what he had left.\n\nLast summer, there was a flap when a memo by a fellow board member, Reed Hastings, the chief executive of Netflix, appeared in The New York Times. In the memo, Mr. Hastings wrote to Mr. Thiel that he displayed \u201ccatastrophically bad judgment\u201d in supporting Mr. Trump.\n\nMark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, did not ask him to step down from the board, and reports that he wants to leave the board are incorrect, Mr. Thiel said, noting that among other things that he brings \u201cideological diversity.\u201d He declined to say exactly how much or what kind of advice the Facebook board was offering Mr. Zuckerberg, but defended the company from criticism that it was slow to wake up to what the Russians did.\n\n\u201cRemember when Trump said the election was going to be rigged? People said that was crazy \u2014 \u2018How dare you question the integrity of the electoral process?\u2019 That was the view of most of the people working at Facebook, too,\u201d he said. \u201cThey did not think things were so hackable. It was a mistake, but an understandable mistake.\u201d Facebook declined to comment.\n\nThe anger now being turned on Facebook, Mr. Thiel argued, is less about Russia specifically and more about tech arrogance \u2014 its failure to do so much for so many. It is a sentiment that helped put Mr. Trump in the White House.\n\n\u201cThe Trump campaign slogan, \u2018Make America Great Again,\u2019 was perhaps the single most offensive thing you could say to Silicon Valley,\u201d he said. \u201cSilicon Valley says the future is going to be better than the past. That is the propaganda, if you will.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA friend of his in Silicon Valley had the idea of running for governor of California this year. Mr. Thiel\u2019s advice was that he had better have a good answer to this question: Why is tech good for the average person in California? The answer, he cautioned, couldn\u2019t be a banality, such as \u201cit\u2019s making us more connected,\u201d and it couldn\u2019t be utopian, such as \u201cit\u2019s going to cure all diseases.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in All Things Tech?

He declined to identify the friend, but it is well known in tech circles that Sam Altman, the president of Y Combinator, the prominent start-up accelerator, was thinking about running. Mr. Altman confirmed it was him and said he had decided not to run \u201cfor many reasons.\u201d\n\nThere is a big painting of a cresting wave in Mr. Thiel\u2019s living room, and it might as well be a visual metaphor for what is going on in big tech now.\n\n\u201cHaving some ambition that transcends just making money is a critical thing for a company,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there is some point where it gets crazy and self-delusional.\u201d He added that the companies \u201care probably in some trouble \u2014 maybe it\u2019s a little, maybe it\u2019s a lot.\u201d The prospect of government regulation looms.\n\nIn 2015 and 2016, Mr. Thiel gave $300,000 to Josh Hawley, who was campaigning to become Missouri\u2019s attorney general. Mr. Hawley won, and in November he opened an antitrust investigation of Google. A spokeswoman for Mr. Hawley, a Republican who is now challenging the state\u2019s Democratic senator, Claire McCaskill, said there was \u201cno connection\u201d between Mr. Thiel\u2019s donation and the investigation. Google declined to comment.\n\nThe news last month that Mr. Thiel is moving from San Francisco to Los Angeles reflects a shift that is as much mental as literal. Getting out of the tech bubble, he figures, will give him more clarity about his investments.\n\n\u201cNetwork effects are very positive things, but there\u2019s a tipping point where they fall over into the madness of crowds,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother of Mr. Thiel\u2019s contentious ideas was destroying Gawker, the online publisher. He secretly financed the privacy lawsuit that Hulk Hogan, the former pro wrestler, filed against the media company, which Mr. Hogan won. That led to Gawker\u2019s bankruptcy in 2016.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA news operation that specialized in deflating the arrogance of Silicon Valley should have been to Mr. Thiel\u2019s liking. But he argues that his philosophy is consistent here.\n\n\u201cGawker was trying to cut people down to size for not conforming,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ability to speak and not have every word you say get distorted, to have wrong ideas and then be able to correct them \u2014 these notions were powerfully undercut by Gawker.\u201d\n\nMr. Thiel is still pursuing the remnants of Gawker in court, which has prompted accusations that he wants to remove all of its content from the internet as a final victory.\n\nHe denied this. \u201cTerry Bollea, a.k.a. Hulk Hogan, is still owed some money from the Gawker sale, and that is what I am trying to get,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want the archives. I don\u2019t think it makes sense to destroy them.

He narrowly won Montgomery County, in greater Dayton, the first Republican to do so since 1988.\n\nAnd Republicans will need those voters to return in the fall if they are to maintain control of Congress.\n\nThe increase in take-home pay for Mr. Kazee was near the top among those for the more than two dozen workers interviewed \u2014 at the tavern, the lumberyard, a machine shop, a restaurant and a municipal building \u2014 about how the tax cut has affected them.

Koch. Those business factions, always important to Republicans in a campaign year, do not like new tariffs.\n\nMr. Trump, on the other hand, has for years preached about the dangers and disadvantages of free trade and the harm it has done to once-leading American industries. Republicans now hoping to talk the president down from his tariff stance may find that his campaign promises about protectionism are ones he truly wants to keep.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt is a similar situation with gun safety. Mr. Trump has in the past backed the idea of an assault weapons ban. But congressional Republicans figured that his strong campaign embrace of the National Rifle Association would keep him securely in the anti-gun-control corner.\n\nThen, in last week\u2019s extraordinary public White House meeting after the Parkland, Fla., school massacre, Mr. Trump embraced multiple aspects of the gun control agenda.

They also figured that, under pressure from his allies at the N.R.A., Mr. Trump would quickly return to the fold and let his enthusiasm for gun control wane. More important, congressional Republicans also knew that gun control legislation was really in their hands, not the administration\u2019s, and that they could easily bottle up any proposal.\n\nBut tariffs are a completely different matter, with the president given wide latitude to act on international trade policy. Republicans, who say they have little legislative recourse, are now engaged in a furious effort to pull the president back from making too sweeping a decision.\n\nThey are also treading carefully to avoid antagonizing a mercurial figure whose mind they still hope to change as they have in previous cases where he drifted from the party line, such as on immigration.\n\nSpeaker Paul D. Ryan, for instance, was careful to credit Mr. Trump on Tuesday for exposing that some countries do take advantage of the trade rules.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s right to point out that there are abuses,\u201d Mr. Ryan said. \u201cThere clearly is dumping and transshipping of steel and aluminum.\u201d\n\nReferring to any trade restrictions, Mr. Ryan said that Republicans simply \u201cwant to make sure that it\u2019s done in a prudent way that\u2019s more surgical, so we can limit unintended consequences.\u201d\n\nAs for Mr. McConnell, he said that \u201cwe need to wait and see what the White House finally decides to do on this.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. McConnell would no doubt prefer that Mr. Trump revert to the conventional conservative principles the senator found so comforting last year.

But immigration has proved to be the most contentious fight, with local officials assuring undocumented immigrants that they would do all they could to protect them.\n\nLast year, California enacted the sanctuary laws, which restrict when and how local law enforcement can cooperate with federal immigration enforcement officers.\n\nBoth Mr. Sessions and Mr. Trump have threatened to pull federal grant money from cities and states that have sanctuary laws to protect undocumented immigrants. They argue that the policies flout federal laws and help criminals evade deportation.\n\nAnd the Justice Department asked 23 jurisdictions across the country this year to provide documentation that they had not kept information from federal immigration authorities, or receive a subpoena for the information. It is also exploring possible criminal charges for local politicians who enact sanctuary policies.\n\nThe lawsuit filed on Tuesday evening in Federal District Court in Sacramento is the first against a local or state government over its immigration policies filed by the Justice Department under Mr. Sessions. Department officials said that they would not rule out the possibility of other lawsuits against local governments whose policies interfere with the federal government\u2019s authority on immigration. Colorado, Illinois, New Mexico, Oregon and Vermont have state sanctuary laws, as do cities and counties in more than a dozen states, according to the Center for Immigration Studies.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne, the California Values Act, strictly limits state and local agencies from sharing information with federal officers about criminals or suspects unless they have been convicted of serious crimes. The law, which took effect Jan. 1, was the centerpiece of the State Legislature\u2019s effort to thwart the Trump administration\u2019s immigration policies.\n\nSoon after the law was enacted, Thomas D.

Mr. Becerra warned that anyone who violated the new law would face a fine of up to $10,000.\n\nIn the state budget bill, California lawmakers prohibited new contracts for immigration detention in the state and gave the state attorney general the power to monitor all state immigration detention centers.\n\nThe state and several local governments including the cities of San Francisco and Sacramento have also set up legal defense funds to help defend immigrants during deportation proceedings.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI\u2019m worried about the \u2018Dreamers,\u2019 hard-working immigrant families and law-abiding people who are just trying to make their way like the rest of us,\u201d Mayor Darrell Steinberg of Sacramento said this year when asked about the state\u2019s sanctuary legislation. \u201cCivil disobedience is a respectful way to show your love for country.\u201d\n\nTensions between local and federal officials reached yet another height last week, when Mayor Libby Schaaf of Oakland publicly warned of coming large-scale immigration arrest operations. Mr. Homan compared the mayor to a \u201cgang lookout yelling, \u201cPolice!\u201d and said she gave people living in the United States illegally a chance to flee. He said her warning meant that the federal immigration authorities arrested about 200 people rather than the 1,000 they had anticipated rounding up.\n\nAlthough Mr. Homan and other federal officials have warned about targeting California as it steps up immigration enforcement efforts, the number of people arrested has not drastically increased so far.

North Korea has made such strides in its nuclear and ballistic missile program in recent years that experts say it could agree to a pause in the testing of missiles, while it conducts negotiations, without really damaging its drive to be a bona fide nuclear weapons state.\n\n\u201cThey use negotiations to buy time,\u201d said Christopher R. Hill, who negotiated with North Korea for several years during the Bush administration.\n\nStill, Mr. Hill noted that it was the first time in more than eight years that North Korea had opened the door to negotiating on its nuclear program.

Those collapses have sometimes been accompanied by what Americans have called cheating, but what the North has called prudence.\n\nIn October 1994, Mr. Clinton concluded what was perhaps the most ambitious nuclear agreement ever reached between Washington and Pyongyang \u2014 called, appropriately, the Agreed Framework.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In return, the White House pledged to give North Korea two alternative nuclear power reactors that could not be used in a weapons program \u2014 as well as fuel to tide it over before the new reactors were ready.\n\nThe 1994 accord blocked the North from reprocessing plutonium from its reactor at Yongbyon. The North complied, but then purchased equipment to enrich uranium, another pathway to a bomb, from Abdul Qadeer Khan, one of the fathers of the Pakistani bomb.\n\nThe agreement headed off a threat by North Korea to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, and eased what had been one of the tensest periods on the Korean Peninsula since the armistice that ended the Korean War.\n\nThe Clinton administration tried to expand the Agreed Framework after North Korea began testing ballistic missiles in 1998. That effort culminated with a trip to Pyongyang by Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright in 2000, and what another American official, Wendy Sherman, later wrote were negotiations that came \u201ctantalizingly close\u201d to a broader agreement.\n\nBut no deal was consummated before Mr. Bush took office, and he initiated his own policy review. The disclosure by American intelligence agencies that North Korea was developing a capability to enrich uranium led the Bush administration to conclude that the Agreed Framework was not worth upholding, and construction on the new reactors was suspended.\n\nAt the end of 2002, North Korea expelled inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency, restarted its nuclear facilities and announced it was withdrawing from the nonproliferation treaty. The Agreed Framework was dead.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFrom then on, negotiations occurred within a framework of six parties: North Korea, the United States, South Korea, China, Russia and Japan. Those talks went on fitfully from 2002 to 2005, when North Korea promised to \u201cabandon nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs\u201d in return for \u201csecurity guarantees.\u201d\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s call for \u201csecurity guarantees\u201d in return for denuclearization is nothing new. It has been the basis of almost all previous negotiations with the United States. And it has usually been one of the reasons those efforts have floundered.\n\nAfter years of haggling over how to verify the North Korean pledge, the six-party talks broke down in 2009, leaving Mr. Obama to deal with a North Korea that had made progress in its nuclear program and remained opaque and suspicious of the outside world.\n\nThe Obama administration showed little appetite for reviving the talks, and instead embarked on a policy of steadily tightening economic pressure on North Korea that it called \u201cstrategic patience.\u201d But American diplomats began quietly meeting with their North Korean counterparts.\n\nOn Feb. 29, 2012, the two sides announced a deal \u2014 the so-called Leap Day Agreement \u2014 under which North Korea would halt operations at its Yongbyon nuclear reactor and allow in inspectors to verify its suspension of nuclear and missile testing. In return, the United States pledged to offer food aid to North Korea.\n\nWithin a month North Korea was threatening to launch a satellite, effectively nullifying the deal.\n\nTo a remarkable extent, diplomats said, Mr. Kim is simply reusing the playbook used by his father, Kim Jong-il, and grandfather, Kim Il-sung.\n\n\u201cLook at the pattern,\u201d said Daniel R. Russel, who served as assistant secretary of state for East Asian Affairs in the Obama administration. \u201cDrive the fear factor to a crescendo; at the maximum moment, play the \u2018maybe I can make the pain go away\u2019 game; and then dangle something vague and undefined.\u201d\n\nBut as Daryl G. Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association, noted, \u201cThe difference between March 2018 and 1994 or 2006 or 2012 is that the North Koreans\u2019 price may have gone up significantly.\u201d", "keywords": ["korean", "predecessors", "kim", "finds", "korea", "administration", "negotiations", "north", "position", "nuclear", "mr", "trump", "united", "states"], "polarity": 0.09460649117907183, "subjectivity": 0.3644311781408555},

I was right during the election campaign by relying on my instinct. I\u2019ll do the same in office.\u2019\u201d\n\nSenator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic minority leader, said that Mr. Cohn\u2019s decision to resign demonstrated that Mr. Trump\u2019s White House could not assemble a coherent team that could navigate the political and policy challenges that face a president.\n\n\u201cOne of the problems here is the White House is getting hollowed out and the number of people capable of doing things, of doing real things whether you agree or disagree ideologically, is getting smaller and smaller,\u201d Mr. Schumer told reporters. \u201cSo the mess-ups we\u2019ve seen this past week,\u201d he added, \u201cI think we\u2019re going to see over and over and over again.\u201d\n\nThe White House pointed the finger the other direction later in the day, accusing Mr. Schumer of blocking the confirmation of many officials nominated by Mr. Trump for no other reason than partisan politics.\n\n\u201cSenator Schumer is blocking nominees indiscriminately,\u201d said Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary. \u201cHe forces time-wasting procedural votes on nominees and then eventually votes in support of them.\u201d She added, \u201cIt\u2019s a disgrace, it\u2019s dangerous and it must come to an end.\u201d\n\nMany of the recent departures, however, have come from the White House staff, which does not require Senate confirmation. Mr. Cohn announced this week that he would step down after losing a fractious internal battle over imposing tariffs. Many White House officials anticipate that some of his top aides will end up leaving as well.\n\nHis resignation came soon after Hope Hicks, the president\u2019s communications director and confidant, said she would leave in the next few weeks and Rob Porter, the White House staff secretary who was part of the inner circle, resigned under pressure amid allegations of spousal abuse by two former wives.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe 43 percent turnover rate calculated by Kathryn Dunn Tenpas, a scholar at the Brookings Institution, far outpaces that of any first-year presidency in the last four decades.

Few of the original team remain in place; among the survivors are Kellyanne Conway, the president\u2019s counselor, and Stephen Miller, his senior policy adviser.\n\nMs. Conway said she frequently reminded colleagues that they served at the pleasure of the president. \u201cThere are only two people in the building that were elected to anything,\u201d she said she told other staff members. \u201cIf you don\u2019t hear your name on the list, get with the program or get out \u2014 Donald J.

The few with staying power tend to be members of the family, although even those who are exiled often stay in his orbit in some fashion. The president, several people close to him said this week, is increasingly running the Oval Office the way he ran his 26th-floor office at Trump Tower, with teams broken into small groups visiting him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously very different from most presidents but it\u2019s how Trump has operated,\u201d said Andy Surabian, a former special assistant to Mr. Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s someone who likes getting different opinions thrown at him.

Stone Jr., Mr. Trump\u2019s longest-serving political hand, said that the changes in staff were ultimately \u201ca good thing because I think that\u2019s how you get back Trumpism. The people who are leaving are the people who are telling him you can\u2019t do this, the people who would dilute the platform on which he was elected.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump has rebuffed concerns from allies and advisers about the tariffs, saying that he is right and that he believes he will be proven so. He has excoriated Mr. Cohn privately for choosing to leave.\n\nMr. Stone said that working in Mr. Trump\u2019s favor is that \u201che\u2019s extraordinarily stubborn. When he sets his mind to do something \u2014 for instance, utilize the threat of tariffs against those are utilizing tariffs against us \u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter who his advisers are. He knows his own mind on this.\u201d\n\nAt a news conference this week, Mr. Trump made clear that he thrived on the constant churning and hinted that there will be more departures soon, but he rejected the idea that he had trouble recruiting new people to work for him because \u201cthe White House has tremendous energy.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThere will be people that change,\u201d he said. \u201cThey always change.

Turns to \u2018School Safety\u2019 Image \u201cThis time, the gun rights crowd messed with the wrong community, the wrong kids and the wrong dad,\u201d said Fred Guttenberg, whose 14-year-old daughter, Jaime, was killed in the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida last month. Credit Tom Brenner/The New York Times\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Republican leaders, turning away from significant gun control legislation, have shifted instead toward measures that would beef up security at the nation\u2019s schools, hoping the push will quell public uproar over the recent massacre in Parkland, Fla.\n\nBut as students and parents from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School continue their own organizing, the school safety strategy is unlikely to end the debate. Democrats and gun control advocates accused Republicans and the National Rifle Association of using school safety to divert attention from what they see as the real issue: the proliferation of guns that have been used in mass shootings at concerts, in movie theaters, on college campuses, in churches and at workplaces, as well as at public schools.\n\n\u201cThis time, the gun rights crowd messed with the wrong community, the wrong kids and the wrong dad,\u201d said Fred Guttenberg, whose 14-year-old daughter, Jaime, was killed at the school. He added, \u201cI intend to be a part of breaking this gun lobby.\u201d\n\nThe Republican-controlled House plans to vote next week on the STOP School Violence Act, a bill that would authorize $50 million annually for safety improvements, including training teachers and students in how to prevent violence and developing anonymous reporting systems for threats of school violence.\n\nThe bill, drafted by Representative John Rutherford, a Republican and former sheriff from Jacksonville, Fla., is one of a flurry of bipartisan measures introduced in the House and the Senate devoted to school safety \u2014 without curbs on guns. In the Senate, a companion bill would also give schools money for physical improvements, such as installing metal detectors or bulletproof doors.\n\nAnd Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, the chairman of the Senate education committee, introduced his own school safety measure on Wednesday. His bill would allow 100,000 public schools to use federal dollars for school counselors, alarm systems, security cameras and crisis intervention training.\n\nEducation Secretary Betsy DeVos threw her weight behind what she said was the only approach that could muster broad support after a brief but contentious visit on Wednesday to Stoneman Douglas High School, where 17 students and faculty were gunned down on Valentine\u2019s Day.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s an opportunity to take some practical steps that many, many people agree on and continue pushing forward on things that have broad support,\u201d she said.\n\nBut as the midterm election season begins, the school safety votes may only be an opening volley.\n\n\u201cThe Republicans would like to have the public think they\u2019re doing something and have the N.R.A. think they\u2019re doing nothing,\u201d said Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 Democrat in the House.\n\nGun control has long been one of the most divisive and contentious issues in Washington, and the rush to legislate on school safety reflects the difficulty of passing measures that have anything to do with guns. On Wednesday, students advocating gun safety legislation staged a sit-in outside the office of Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, chanting \u201cEnough is enough!\u201d and \u201cNot one more!\u201d Eight were arrested, police said.\n\nBut most gun safety proposals \u2014 including expanding background checks for gun purchases, raising the minimum age for buying rifles to 21 from 18, banning assault-style weapons like the AR-15 used by the gunman in Parkland and taking guns away from people deemed mentally unfit \u2014 appear to be going nowhere on Capitol Hill. President Trump\u2019s mercurial statements have not helped. At a televised White House session, he appeared to back broad gun control legislation, only to muddy his position after an evening meeting with the N.R.A.\u2019s chief lobbyist.\n\nOne exception is the Fix NICS Act, a modest measure that would offer incentives to states and federal agencies to improve reporting to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, for gun purchasers. The measure, which is backed by the N.R.A., has already passed the House and has broad bipartisan support in the Senate.\n\nBut even that legislation is facing a hurdle: Mr. McConnell cannot bring it up quickly for a vote because Senate rules require unanimous consent to do so, and at least one senator, Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, has objected. And while Mr. McConnell is a co-sponsor of the Senate\u2019s version of the STOP School Violence Act, he has not said when the Senate will consider it.\n\nThe Senate\u2019s chief sponsor of the STOP School Violence Act, Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, said in an interview Wednesday that his aim was to focus on \u201cspecial programs and special approaches toward making these schools safer and more acceptable to the families and kids.\u201d\n\nAs for Democrats who consider the measure insufficient, Mr. Hatch said: \u201cThat\u2019s their motif every time. I mean, they know that if they can raise hell against guns and so forth, that that gives them a lot of publicity. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily help us in our educational processes.\u201d\n\nSenator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut and a co-sponsor of Mr. Hatch\u2019s bill, said he did not want the Senate to lose sight of more far-reaching legislation that would address gun violence head-on.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a useful bill, but it doesn\u2019t have anything to do with gun laws,\u201d Mr. Murphy said. \u201cAnybody whose only solution to the school shooting epidemic is to make our schools fortresses doesn\u2019t understand the root of this problem.\u201d\n\nRandi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, also welcomed efforts to increase safety measures and resources, but she said legislators and Mr. Trump had used it deflect from the larger demands of the public, including students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas, who had been in the forefront of gun control advocacy since the shooting.\n\n\u201cThe kids from Stoneman Douglas said, \u2018Do certain common-sense, gun violence reduction measures \u2014 don\u2019t change the subject,\u2019\u201d Ms. Weingarten said.\n\nWhile Republicans were talking about school safety, Senate Democrats on Thursday sought to keep the focus on guns. Senators Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, and Bill Nelson of Florida, convened a Democrats-only afternoon hearing to take testimony from those affected by gun violence.\n\nAmong the witnesses were Mr. Guttenberg and David Hogg, a 17-year-old Stoneman Douglas senior who has become a vocal national spokesman for gun control.\n\nIn Parkland on Wednesday, Ms. DeVos was greeted less than enthusiastically by many students, who took to social media to complain that she did not have any substantive interactions with them. (Dwyane Wade, a basketball star for the Miami Heat who visited after Ms. DeVos, got a much warmer reception.)\n\n\u201cI thought she would at least give us her \u2018thoughts and prayers,\u2019 but she refused to even meet/speak with students. I don\u2019t understand the point of her being here,\u201d tweeted Carly Novell, editor of the student newspaper, The Eagle Eye, which covered the secretary\u2019s visit.\n\nAnother student, Aly Sheehy, tweeted, \u201cDo something unexpected: answer our questions.\u201d\n\nThe Education Department said that Ms. DeVos visited some students and teachers and laid a wreath, and that her visit was developed with the principal\u2019s recommendations in mind to \u201cprovide minimal disruption on students\u2019 first full day back in the school.\u201d In her news conference, Ms. DeVos said she promised student journalists that she would return to meet with them.\n\n\n\nThomas Kaplan contributed reporting.

Credit Noah Berger/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Attorney General Jeff Sessions sued California this week for not doing enough to find and punish unauthorized immigrants, and said on Wednesday he was girding for an epic battle.\n\n\u201cCalifornia is using every power it has \u2014 and some it doesn\u2019t \u2014 to frustrate federal law enforcement,\u201d he said in a speech in Sacramento. \u201cSo you can be sure I\u2019m going to use every power I have to stop them.\u201d\n\nOne of the weapons Mr. Sessions is counting on is a 2012 Supreme Court ruling siding with the Obama administration, which had sued Arizona for violating federal immigration laws. But in that case Mr. Obama\u2019s lawyers accused the state of going too far in trying to find and punish unauthorized immigrants.\n\n\u201cThe state may not pursue policies that undermine federal law,\u201d Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote for the majority.\n\nSo it may turn out that the principle of federal supremacy over immigration established by the Obama administration will help the Trump Justice Department achieve diametrically different goals.\n\n\u201cThe tables are turned,\u201d said Peter J. Spiro, a law professor at Temple University.\n\nThe California case seems likely to reach the Supreme Court, where it could give rise to a landmark reckoning on the role of states in setting immigration policy. In the process, state and federal officials, along with judges and justices, will face a test of their commitment to consistency.\n\nThey will face stark choices. One is to apply legal principles established in a case that mostly protected immigrants to one that seeks to imperil them. Another is to revise those principles in light of the very different circumstances.\n\nStephen Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas, said history was repeating itself, but backward.\n\n\u201cThe suit is modeled on the Obama administration\u2019s successful suit against Arizona,\u201d he said. But he added that \u201csome of the key considerations are flipped.\u201d\n\nIn the Arizona case, conservatives insisted that respect for state sovereignty required letting states play a leading role in controlling immigration within their borders. But Mr. Sessions, a longtime conservative himself, disavowed that position in his speech on Wednesday. \u201cImmigration law is the province of the federal government,\u201d he said.\n\nJustice Antonin Scalia, the conservative jurist who died in 2016, took a different view of the Arizona case. In an impassioned partial dissent, he wrote that \u201cit is easy to lose sight of the states\u2019 traditional role in regulating immigration \u2014 and to overlook their sovereign prerogative to do so.\u201d\n\nThere is no doubt that the California lawsuit is at odds with some of the Trump administration\u2019s usual positions. \u201cIt\u2019s a fascinating suit on a number of levels,\u201d Professor Vladeck said, \u201cnot the least of which is the aggressive assertion of federal enforcement power directly against states by those, like Attorney General Sessions, who have historically been ardent defenders of states\u2019 rights in the deeply analogous contexts.\u201d\n\nCristina Rodriguez, a law professor at Yale, said she detected political parallels between the two suits.\n\n\u201cBoth administrations claim that the state laws they challenge impermissibly interfere with the executive branch\u2019s ability to enforce the immigration laws,\u201d she said. \u201cBut both lawsuits are also clearly designed to take on visible and politically powerful local officials whose vision of immigration policy conflicts with the president\u2019s and his supporters\u2019.\u201d\n\nIn a news conference on Wednesday, Xavier Becerra, the California attorney general, said he was ready for the fight. The state\u2019s laws, he said, were \u201cfully constitutional and provide for the safety and welfare of all our people.\u201d\n\n\u201cCalifornia is in the business of public safety,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not in the business of deportations.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department challenged parts of three of California\u2019s so-called sanctuary laws. One restricts employers from cooperating with immigration officials. A second generally prohibits state officials from telling federal ones when undocumented immigrants are to be released from state custody. A third requires state officials to inspect some facilities that house people detained on behalf of the federal government.\n\nJennifer Chacon, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine, said the state laws had been carefully written to avoid direct conflicts with federal immigration laws. \u201cI think it is clear that California deliberately tried to draft laws that involved core exercises of state police power in a way that did not run afoul of federal law,\u201d she said.\n\nEach state law presents different issues, and courts may give varying answers depending on how directly the state laws conflict with federal ones. More generally, though, courts will take account of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in the Arizona case, which called for collaboration rather than conflict.\n\n\u201cConsultation between federal and state officials is an important feature of the immigration system,\u201d Justice Kennedy wrote in the court\u2019s decision in the Arizona case.\n\nGov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, has said that consultation is fine but that federal officials should not use California\u2019s resources to pursue undocumented Californians. The federal government, he added, may do so on its own.\n\n\u201cThey are free to use their own considerable resources to enforce federal immigration law in California,\u201d he said in October in signing one of the challenged laws.\n\nThe Supreme Court has said that the federal government may not commandeer state resources to achieve federal objectives. In his speech on Wednesday, Mr. Sessions denied that anything like that was afoot.\n\n\n\n\u201cContrary to what you might hear from the lawless open borders radicals,\u201d he said, \u201cwe are not asking California, Oakland or anyone else to enforce immigration laws.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are simply asking California and other sanctuary jurisdictions to stop actively obstructing federal law enforcement,\u201d he added.\n\nBut Professor Rodriguez said the commandeering issue was a substantial one. \u201cTo the extent the Trump administration\u2019s claims against California would produce an outcome that would effectively force states and localities to participate in immigration enforcement,\u201d she said, \u201cthere could be an unconstitutional commandeering.\u201d\n\nProfessor Spiro said that California may have the upper hand in the suit\u2019s early stages, as the issues in it are novel, leaving judges with substantial discretion.\n\nThe Trump administration has not fared well in federal courts in California in other cases concerning immigration, including ones challenging President Trump\u2019s efforts to restrict travel from predominantly Muslim countries and to rescind a program protecting some 700,000 young unauthorized immigrants from deportation.\n\nBut the ultimate fate of the suit will probably rest with the Supreme Court. In 2012, with what may have been unwarranted optimism, Justice Kennedy said he hoped that conflicts over immigration policy would be worked out through reasoned discussion.\n\n\u201cThe national government has significant power to regulate immigration,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe sound exercise of national power over immigration depends on the nation\u2019s meeting its responsibility to base its laws on a political will informed by searching, thoughtful, rational civic discourse.\u201d\n\nFollow Adam Liptak on Twitter: @adamliptak.

The new policy does not mean that all trophies will be automatically permitted, officials said. The applicants will have to meet the same conservation and sustainability requirements as before.\n\nThe decision was long sought by Safari Club International and the National Rifle Association, which had filed the lawsuit against the agency.\n\n\u201cWe were surprised as anyone when they came out with that announcement last week, but we think it\u2019s a positive step,\u201d said Richard Parsons, chief executive of Safari Club International. \u201cAs much as some people have a distaste for hunting, in southern Africa it actually works and is very positive for wildlife conservation.\u201d\n\nWhether safari hunting ultimately helps or harms fragile animal populations is a controversial question.\n\nHunting organizations point out that big-game sportsmen \u2014 who may pay $100,000 or more per hunt to shoot a lion or elephant \u2014 can provide indispensable funding for conservation.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in this business a long time and listened to a lot of animal-rights organizations that talk loudly about how they\u2019re going to save rhinos and elephants, but we\u2019re the ones putting money on the ground to make it happen,\u201d Mr. Parsons said. \u201cWe think the Fish and Wildlife Service is on the right track to make solid decisions for elephant conservation.\u201d\n\nBut conservation groups argue that alternatives should be pursued, especially when the quarry are endangered species.\n\n\u201cThese are animals that our country has decided we\u2019re going to protect, and we should all get to have a say in their protection,\u201d said Elly Pepper, deputy director of the wildlife trade initiative at the Natural Resources Defense Council.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThe decision regarding whether someone\u2019s allowed to shoot an endangered species shouldn\u2019t be made behind closed doors.\u201d\n\nThe agency previously made determinations about trophies publicly available, she said, but under the new system interested parties will have to file a Freedom of Information request to see details of case-by-case trophy hunting permits. Each request can take months to process.\n\nOthers share Ms. Pepper\u2019s concerns. \u201cThese decisions are all going to be made in the dark, and this new case-by-case approach doesn\u2019t give anyone comfort that these animals will be protected in the way the previous system did,\u201d said Kitty Block, acting president and chief executive of the Humane Society of the United States.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The president has not been questioned by Mr. Mueller; Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers are negotiating terms of a possible interview. Learning even basic details about what other witnesses told investigators could help the president shape his own answers.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s interactions with Mr. McGahn unfolded in the days after the Jan. 25 Times article, which said that Mr. McGahn threatened to quit last June after the president asked him to fire the special counsel. After the article was published, the White House staff secretary, Rob Porter, told Mr. McGahn that the president wanted him to release a statement saying that the story was not true, the people said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Porter, who resigned last month amid a domestic abuse scandal, told Mr. McGahn the president had suggested he might \u201cget rid of\u201d Mr. McGahn if he chose not to challenge the article, the people briefed on the conversation said.\n\nMr. McGahn did not publicly deny the article, and the president later confronted him in the Oval Office in front of the White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, according to the people.\n\nThe president said he had never ordered Mr. McGahn to fire the special counsel. Mr. McGahn replied that the president was wrong and that he had in fact asked Mr. McGahn in June to call the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, to tell him that the special counsel had a series of conflicts that disqualified him for overseeing the investigation and that he had to be dismissed. The president told Mr. McGahn that he did not remember the discussion that way.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Trump moved on, pointing out that Mr. McGahn had never told him that he was going to resign over the order to fire the special counsel. Mr. McGahn acknowledged that that was true but said that he had told senior White House officials at the time that he was going to quit.\n\nIt is not clear how the confrontation was resolved. Mr. McGahn has stayed on as White House counsel, one of the few senior administration officials who has been with the president since the campaign.\n\nMr. Priebus met with the president in the West Wing in December, according to the people with knowledge of their encounter. Allies of Mr. Priebus, who left the White House in July 2017, have cautioned him to keep his distance. But Mr. Priebus, who is seeking to build a law practice as a Washington power broker who can open doors for clients, has maintained contact and occasionally visited the White House to see Mr. Trump and his own replacement, Mr. Kelly.\n\nMr. Trump brought up Mr. Priebus\u2019s October interview with the special counsel\u2019s office, the people said, and Mr. Priebus replied that the investigators were courteous and professional. He shared no specifics and did not say what he had told investigators, and the conversation moved on after a few minutes, those briefed on it said.

There is no nullification, there is no secession. Federal law is the supreme law of the land,\u201d said Mr. Sessions, one of the administration\u2019s most adamant immigration restrictionists. He accused the state of intentionally using \u201cevery power the legislature has to undermine the duly established immigration laws of America.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit, which the Justice Department disclosed on Tuesday in advance of Mr. Sessions\u2019s speech, capped a clash between the Trump administration and California that has lasted more than a year, with each side reaping political profit from the battle. The administration has sought to demonstrate that it will not tolerate noncompliance with federal immigration enforcement; California\u2019s top officials, professed leaders of the anti-Trump resistance, have pushed the state to cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement as little as possible.\n\nEven as Mr. Sessions spoke, that opposition was making itself heard. Outside the hotel where Mr. Sessions was speaking, several hundred protesters marched, holding signs saying \u201cGo Home Jeff\u201d and \u201cCrush ICE\u201d and chanting, \u201cWhat do we want? Sessions out!\u201d\n\nShortly after Mr. Sessions\u2019s speech, Mr. Brown and the state\u2019s attorney general, Xavier Becerra, both Democrats, appeared together in the Capitol to denounce the lawsuit.\n\n\u201cCalifornia is in the business of public safety,\u201d Mr. Becerra said. \u201cWe are not in the business of deportation.\u201d\n\nThe suit, filed on Tuesday evening in Federal District Court in Sacramento, is the first Mr. Sessions\u2019s Justice Department has filed against a local or state government over its immigration policies.\n\nPhoto\n\nIt targets three state laws passed in recent months: one that limits state and local agencies\u2019 ability to share information about criminals or suspects with federal immigration officers, unless they have been convicted of serious crimes; a second that prohibits local businesses from allowing ICE to examine employee records without a court order or a subpoena; and a third that gave California officials more oversight over the state\u2019s immigration detention centers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Brown and Mr. Becerra defended the legislation as constitutional on Wednesday, saying that the laws prevented neither ICE agents from working in local jails and prisons nor employers from cooperating with ICE. The employee records law, Mr. Becerra said, simply ensures that workers and employers are guaranteed \u201ctheir rights and their privacy and that those are being respected.\u201d\n\nAsked whether the law would, in effect, require warning undocumented workers to flee ahead of an ICE visit, Mr. Brown compared the provision to the practice of notifying criminal suspects that they have a right to a lawyer. \u201cWe are just following the law, and the law allows people to be advised of their rights,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cAnything else smacks of a more totalitarian approach to things.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He heartily ripped into Libby Schaaf, the Democratic mayor of Oakland, for issuing a warning last week that ICE planned to arrest immigrants across Northern California, an alert that infuriated agency officials who said her tip-off had allowed hundreds of their targets to slip away.\n\nMs. Schaaf\u2019s actions \u201csupport those who flout the law and boldly validates illegality,\u201d Mr. Sessions said, calling her warning \u201can embarrassment to the proud state of California.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo here\u2019s my message to Mayor Schaaf,\u201d he said. \u201cHow dare you, how dare you needlessly endanger the lives of our law enforcement officers to promote a radical open borders agenda?\u201d\n\nMs. Schaaf said last week that she had not publicized any information that endangered ICE officers. She said she issued the warning because \u201cI know that Oakland is a city of law-abiding immigrants and families who deserve to live free from the constant threat of arrest and deportation.\u201d\n\nInside the hotel ballroom on Wednesday, Mr. Sessions faced a polite, if somewhat divided, audience.\n\nSome police chiefs and sheriffs in liberal-leaning areas have argued that their agencies must distance themselves from ICE to avoid scaring off immigrant residents who may be more reluctant to serve as witnesses or come forward to report crimes. But there are many other officials across the country who say they would prefer to work with ICE if the legal issues surrounding such cooperation are clarified, and some who are eager to help the federal government outright with immigration enforcement.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThose tensions were palpable at Mr. Sessions\u2019s speech, which was hosted by the California Peace Officers Association, a law enforcement advocacy group. The crowd responded to the speech with brief applause; about 10 of the more than 200 officers in the room stood to clap.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m stuck in the middle,\u201d said Deputy Chief Derek Williams of the police department in Ontario, a midsize city east of Los Angeles with a large Hispanic population. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely bifurcated now.\u201d\n\nWhile the new state laws do not affect his work on a day-to-day basis, he said, the sharp increase in ICE activity has fostered \u201ca lack of trust with law enforcement\u201d among immigrant residents. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult time for us,\u201d he said.\n\nAmong those who endorsed Mr. Sessions\u2019s message was Paul R. Curry, a lobbyist for the California Correctional Supervisors Organization, which represents supervisors in the state prison system. He said California police chiefs were often caught between ICE\u2019s requests and the orders of their mayors, who might embrace sanctuary policies.\n\n\u201cEvery police officer is sworn to uphold the law not only of the state but the nation,\u201d Mr. Curry said. \u201cThe progressive agenda is running afoul of the force of our laws in the country.\u201d", "keywords": ["speech", "scolds", "sessions", "state", "law", "ice", "laws", "problem", "enforcement", "immigration", "mr", "federal", "jeff", "california"], "polarity": 0.07449416525503484, "subjectivity": 0.38028734550473675},

It offers a comprehensive look at how Mr. Trump is influencing the direction of the federal government, beyond high-profile cabinet appointments and other Senate-confirmed posts, and how he has rewarded people who have been loyal to him or share his priorities.\n\nHanding out political jobs to former campaign workers, like-minded experts, lawyers and erstwhile lobbyists is a grand tradition in Washington, where, to the victor, go the spoils. Each president has about 4,000 political posts to fill; separately, there are two million civilian federal workers who are largely hired through a competitive process.\n\nJust over a year into his presidency, Mr. Trump has yet to formally nominate candidates for nearly 35 percent of the 639 positions needing Senate confirmation, according to the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit group that tracks federal appointments. Mr. Trump arrived at the White House without a large contingent of well-known Washington names at the ready, and some jobs have been filled with people new to government or lacking experience in the fields where they now work, according to a review of financial disclosures.\n\nNo comparative database exists from previous administrations, but scholars and other experts on presidential transitions say the Trump appointments stand out.\n\n\u201cOverall, my reading is that the Trump political appointees have less expertise, in their respective areas, than any presidential administration dating back to at least the Reagan era,\u201d said Thomas E. Mann, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who reviewed the database. Mr. Mann has specialized in federal government studies for four decades and has tracked the process that previous administrations have used to fill political jobs.\n\nLindsay Walters, deputy White House press secretary, said the administration had appointed well-qualified staff.\n\n\u201cThe president selects the highest caliber of individuals from an array of backgrounds and experiences to fill positions in his administration,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cWe are proud that these individuals \u2014 whether they worked on the campaign, conservative think tanks or elsewhere \u2014 share the president\u2019s vision that got him elected.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAgency officials added that these new political hires had brought value to government. For instance, Heather Nauert, a State Department spokeswoman, said in a statement that Matthew Mowers, the former Trump campaign official who recently traveled to South Africa, provided a \u201cfresh focus and renewed passion for helping women, children and men who are living with H.I.V./AIDS.\u201d\n\nMr. Mowers, who had also worked on the presidential campaign of Chris Christie, the former governor of New Jersey, is chief of staff in the Office of the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator. Last month, he tweeted from South Africa, \u201cGreat meeting today with Ministry of Health Officials in Johannesburg.\u201d\n\nOne of the top sources of the appointees has been the presidential campaign, according to the database. Some of the people listed in the database have already left the Trump administration, but it offers a snapshot of those hired for political jobs in the past year. At the White House alone, there have been almost 60 former campaign workers. In addition, about 20 have been hired at the Energy Department, and another 20 or so at the Commerce Department.\n\nSome of the Commerce jobs have been filled with people who have extensive experience in government or the private sector. One of them is Mira Ricardel, the under secretary for export administration, whose career includes stints at Boeing, at the Defense Department and on Capitol Hill. During the campaign, she was a consultant to Trump for America.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

Jonathan Wardell, the aide in the secretary\u2019s office, graduated in 2016 from Stony Brook University in New York. William Reinert, who works in the public affairs office, graduated from Troy University in Alabama in 2016; his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 cites six months with the Trump campaign and other short-term jobs, including on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe former campaign field worker who now promotes sales of nuclear energy equipment abroad is Cameron Dorsey, a 2014 graduate of Washington and Lee University in Virginia who also worked briefly for the Republican National Committee and a political consulting firm, according to her financial disclosure form.\n\nThe Commerce Department did not comment on the experience level of some of its recent hires. But Secretary Wilbur L. Ross Jr. said in a statement that the department sought the best candidates for positions, adding, \u201cIt is important that young people show interest and get involved in public service.\u201d\n\nAt the State Department, political appointees include Taylor Bush, whose title is listed as special assistant. Mr. Bush was a field director for the campaign in Fairfax, Va., and also worked on the inaugural committee and at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. The only other recent source of income listed on his financial disclosure form was a bartending job at the Hamilton Restaurant in Washington.\n\n\u201cThe work of a special assistant requires someone who has good interpersonal skills, is well organized and who can handle multiple assignments simultaneously,\u201d the State Department spokeswoman said in a statement. \u201cTaylor Bush is a hard worker \u2014 he proved himself in these areas during the campaign and, as a result, was asked to join the State Department.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe former lobbyists who have joined the administration include some who recently lobbied the agencies where they now work. Melissa F. Burnison, for example, was in February confirmed as an assistant secretary for congressional affairs at the Energy Department. As recently as the fourth quarter of last year, Ms. Burnison was involved in lobbying the department on behalf of the Nuclear Energy Institute, which represents the nuclear industry, according to lobbying disclosures.\n\n\n\nAn Energy spokeswoman said Ms. Burnison \u201cwill continue to comply with guidelines, waiver or no waiver.\u201d Without an ethics waiver, she is prohibited from working on issues with which she was previously involved.\n\nThe administration has granted at least 31 waivers to some former lobbyists and others who had private-sector jobs that overlap with their new federal assignments, according to the database. Among them is Erik Baptist, a senior deputy general counsel at the Environmental Protection Agency. He previously worked for the American Petroleum Institute as a lobbyist on federal regulations related to renewable fuels.\n\nThe appointees from conservative research and advocacy groups reflect Mr. Trump\u2019s right-leaning politics.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation tops the list, according to the ProPublica tally, with at least 25 former employees now working for the administration.\n\nNext is Freedom Partners, a nonprofit group led by the general counsel of Koch Industries, with 16 people who were compensated by the organization. They are among about 35 Trump political appointees who worked for or consulted with different groups affiliated with the billionaire libertarian brothers Charles G. and David H. Koch.\n\nThe conservative appointees are spread across the government. At the Interior Department, Ryan Nichols is an adviser in the Office of Water and Science, after coordinating the Heritage Foundation\u2019s work with a group of climate change skeptics called the \u201cCooler Heads Coalition.\u201d Also from the Heritage Foundation is Steven Groves, who works at the White House after writing forcefully against international agreements in collaboration with groups like the United Nations Human Rights Council.\n\nIt is an open question whether the tradition of filling lower-level political jobs with people loyal to the president, or at least grateful for a job, has much influence on policy.

After Mr. Thiel spoke at the Republican National Convention in 2016, there were unsourced media reports that said Mr. Trump wanted to put him on the Supreme Court. But now even photo ops are rare.\n\nThe investor said he had last spoken to the president \u201ca few months ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t talk that often,\u201d he said, but added, \u201cI can get access anytime I want.\u201d\n\nThe Trump whom Mr. Thiel touted at the Republican convention was a candidate who would \u201cend the era of stupid wars and rebuild our country,\u201d move us past \u201cfake culture wars\u201d and start projects the equivalent of the Apollo space program. That does not seem to be the president he got.\n\n\u201cThere are all these ways that things have fallen short,\u201d Mr. Thiel said. But he said he had no regrets about his endorsement. \u201cIt\u2019s still better than Hillary Clinton or the Republican zombies,\u201d he said, referring to the other candidates.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMr. Thiel is routinely labeled a libertarian. On a bookshelf in the apartment, as if in confirmation, is a hardback copy of Ayn Rand\u2019s \u201cAtlas Shrugged,\u201d the bible of the movement. A gift, he said.\n\nA lesser-known but possibly deeper influence was the French philosopher Ren\u00e9 Girard, who taught at Stanford University when Mr. Thiel was an undergraduate there. For 15 years, on and off, Mr. Thiel sat in on a study group about Mr. Girard\u2019s ideas. Mr. Girard believed human beings were deeply mimetic, which is to say they copy one another.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very anti-Ayn Rand: There are no self-contained autonomous figures,\u201d Mr. Thiel said. \u201cOur desires are not our own. They get shaped powerfully by the society around us.\u201d\n\nIt was this illumination that helped him see the potential of Facebook \u2014 where people could find out in intimate and addictive detail what their friends were up to \u2014 when it was barely a year old. He was the first outside investor, buying 10 percent of the company for $500,000.\n\nHe sold most of his holdings in 2012 as Facebook went public. A few months ago, with Facebook\u2019s market capitalization at about $500 billion, he sold most of what he had left.\n\nLast summer, there was a flap when a memo by a fellow board member, Reed Hastings, the chief executive of Netflix, appeared in The New York Times. In the memo, Mr. Hastings wrote to Mr. Thiel that he displayed \u201ccatastrophically bad judgment\u201d in supporting Mr. Trump.\n\nMark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, did not ask him to step down from the board, and reports that he wants to leave the board are incorrect, Mr. Thiel said, noting that among other things that he brings \u201cideological diversity.\u201d He declined to say exactly how much or what kind of advice the Facebook board was offering Mr. Zuckerberg, but defended the company from criticism that it was slow to wake up to what the Russians did.\n\n\u201cRemember when Trump said the election was going to be rigged? People said that was crazy \u2014 \u2018How dare you question the integrity of the electoral process?\u2019 That was the view of most of the people working at Facebook, too,\u201d he said. \u201cThey did not think things were so hackable. It was a mistake, but an understandable mistake.\u201d Facebook declined to comment.\n\nThe anger now being turned on Facebook, Mr. Thiel argued, is less about Russia specifically and more about tech arrogance \u2014 its failure to do so much for so many. It is a sentiment that helped put Mr. Trump in the White House.\n\n\u201cThe Trump campaign slogan, \u2018Make America Great Again,\u2019 was perhaps the single most offensive thing you could say to Silicon Valley,\u201d he said. \u201cSilicon Valley says the future is going to be better than the past. That is the propaganda, if you will.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA friend of his in Silicon Valley had the idea of running for governor of California this year. Mr. Thiel\u2019s advice was that he had better have a good answer to this question: Why is tech good for the average person in California? The answer, he cautioned, couldn\u2019t be a banality, such as \u201cit\u2019s making us more connected,\u201d and it couldn\u2019t be utopian, such as \u201cit\u2019s going to cure all diseases.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in All Things Tech?

He declined to identify the friend, but it is well known in tech circles that Sam Altman, the president of Y Combinator, the prominent start-up accelerator, was thinking about running. Mr. Altman confirmed it was him and said he had decided not to run \u201cfor many reasons.\u201d\n\nThere is a big painting of a cresting wave in Mr. Thiel\u2019s living room, and it might as well be a visual metaphor for what is going on in big tech now.\n\n\u201cHaving some ambition that transcends just making money is a critical thing for a company,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there is some point where it gets crazy and self-delusional.\u201d He added that the companies \u201care probably in some trouble \u2014 maybe it\u2019s a little, maybe it\u2019s a lot.\u201d The prospect of government regulation looms.\n\nIn 2015 and 2016, Mr. Thiel gave $300,000 to Josh Hawley, who was campaigning to become Missouri\u2019s attorney general. Mr. Hawley won, and in November he opened an antitrust investigation of Google. A spokeswoman for Mr. Hawley, a Republican who is now challenging the state\u2019s Democratic senator, Claire McCaskill, said there was \u201cno connection\u201d between Mr. Thiel\u2019s donation and the investigation. Google declined to comment.\n\nThe news last month that Mr. Thiel is moving from San Francisco to Los Angeles reflects a shift that is as much mental as literal. Getting out of the tech bubble, he figures, will give him more clarity about his investments.\n\n\u201cNetwork effects are very positive things, but there\u2019s a tipping point where they fall over into the madness of crowds,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother of Mr. Thiel\u2019s contentious ideas was destroying Gawker, the online publisher. He secretly financed the privacy lawsuit that Hulk Hogan, the former pro wrestler, filed against the media company, which Mr. Hogan won. That led to Gawker\u2019s bankruptcy in 2016.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA news operation that specialized in deflating the arrogance of Silicon Valley should have been to Mr. Thiel\u2019s liking.

Hulk Hogan, is still owed some money from the Gawker sale, and that is what I am trying to get,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want the archives. I don\u2019t think it makes sense to destroy them.

He narrowly won Montgomery County, in greater Dayton, the first Republican to do so since 1988.\n\nAnd Republicans will need those voters to return in the fall if they are to maintain control of Congress.\n\nThe increase in take-home pay for Mr. Kazee was near the top among those for the more than two dozen workers interviewed \u2014 at the tavern, the lumberyard, a machine shop, a restaurant and a municipal building \u2014 about how the tax cut has affected them.

Koch. Those business factions, always important to Republicans in a campaign year, do not like new tariffs.\n\nMr. Trump, on the other hand, has for years preached about the dangers and disadvantages of free trade and the harm it has done to once-leading American industries. Republicans now hoping to talk the president down from his tariff stance may find that his campaign promises about protectionism are ones he truly wants to keep.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt is a similar situation with gun safety. Mr. Trump has in the past backed the idea of an assault weapons ban. But congressional Republicans figured that his strong campaign embrace of the National Rifle Association would keep him securely in the anti-gun-control corner.\n\nThen, in last week\u2019s extraordinary public White House meeting after the Parkland, Fla., school massacre, Mr. Trump embraced multiple aspects of the gun control agenda.

The seat is held by Representative Will Hurd, a Republican who has narrowly won twice, but Democrats argue that Mr. Hurd will have a more difficult time surviving the backlash to Mr. Trump.\n\nImage Although Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke, a Senate hopeful, won the Democratic primary race, he lost a substantial number of votes to two little-known opponents.

Colin Allred, a former Obama Housing and Urban Development Department official and an N.F.L. veteran, advanced to the runoff and will compete against either Lillian Salerno, another official in Mr. Obama\u2019s Agriculture Department, or a former television reporter, Brett Shipp, for the nomination.\n\nIn statewide races, George P. Bush, the state land commissioner and a son of former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, averted a runoff after a somewhat difficult primary campaign against Jerry Patterson, who previously held the job and accused Mr. Bush of mismanaging the General Land Office so badly that it brought him out of retirement.\n\nMr. Bush, one of the few members of his family to back Mr. Trump, was scared enough about the challenge that he produced fliers noting that he was \u201cstanding beside our president.\u201d And he offered Mr. Trump a \u201cMAGA\u201d post last week on Twitter \u2014 invoking the president\u2019s campaign slogan, \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d \u2014 after Mr. Trump offered his support via tweet and noted that Mr. Bush had supported him \u201cwhen it wasn\u2019t the politically correct thing to do.\u201d\n\nSenator Ted Cruz faced minimal opposition in the Republican primary, but his Democratic opponent, Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke, won the nomination while losing a substantial number of votes to two little-known opponents, demonstrating that he is not well known yet among many of the state\u2019s voters.\n\nGov. Greg Abbott, a Republican with a $43 million war chest, was renominated and will face either Lupe Valdez, the former Dallas County sheriff, or Andrew White, the son of former Gov. Mark White, in the general election.\n\nYet even while Mr. Abbott is an overwhelming favorite for re-election, he proved that he did not have an iron grip on his party: Two of the three Republican state representatives he opposed as part of an unusual intervention against incumbents still managed to win.\n\nManny Fernandez reported from Houston, and Jonathan Martin from Moon, Pa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "keywords": ["republican", "democratic", "bush", "state", "primary", "trump", "democrats", "antitrump", "sentiment", "polls", "mr", "surge", "runoff", "texas", "ms"], "polarity": 0.1530384517443342, "subjectivity": 0.38587420422714536},

SAD!!!\u201d\n\nCalifornia began battling the Trump administration even before Mr. Trump took office, standing in opposition on a number of issues, including marijuana, environmental regulations and taxes. But immigration has proved to be the most contentious fight, with local officials assuring undocumented immigrants that they would do all they could to protect them.\n\nLast year, California enacted the sanctuary laws, which restrict when and how local law enforcement can cooperate with federal immigration enforcement officers.\n\nBoth Mr. Sessions and Mr. Trump have threatened to pull federal grant money from cities and states that have sanctuary laws to protect undocumented immigrants. They argue that the policies flout federal laws and help criminals evade deportation.\n\nAnd the Justice Department asked 23 jurisdictions across the country this year to provide documentation that they had not kept information from federal immigration authorities, or receive a subpoena for the information. It is also exploring possible criminal charges for local politicians who enact sanctuary policies.\n\nThe lawsuit filed on Tuesday evening in Federal District Court in Sacramento is the first against a local or state government over its immigration policies filed by the Justice Department under Mr. Sessions. Department officials said that they would not rule out the possibility of other lawsuits against local governments whose policies interfere with the federal government\u2019s authority on immigration. Colorado, Illinois, New Mexico, Oregon and Vermont have state sanctuary laws, as do cities and counties in more than a dozen states, according to the Center for Immigration Studies.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne, the California Values Act, strictly limits state and local agencies from sharing information with federal officers about criminals or suspects unless they have been convicted of serious crimes. The law, which took effect Jan. 1, was the centerpiece of the State Legislature\u2019s effort to thwart the Trump administration\u2019s immigration policies.\n\nSoon after the law was enacted, Thomas D. Homan, the acting director of United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said that the state should expect to see \u201ca lot more deportation officers\u201d and that elected officials who support the policy should be arrested.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to start charging some of these politicians with crimes,\u201d he said. \u201cThese politicians can\u2019t make these decisions and be held unaccountable for people dying. I mean, we need to hold these politicians accountable for their actions.\u201d\n\nMr. Homan and three other immigration and border protection officials filed declarations with the suit claiming that California\u2019s laws had already negatively affected their work.\n\n\u201cThe administration is just angry that a state has stood up to them \u2014 one that embraces diversity and inclusivity and is the sixth-largest economy in the world thanks to the hard-working immigrants who want to become American citizens,\u201d said Kevin de Le\u00f3n, the leader of the California State Senate who wrote one of the sanctuary city laws named in the suit.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

Mr. Becerra warned that anyone who violated the new law would face a fine of up to $10,000.\n\nIn the state budget bill, California lawmakers prohibited new contracts for immigration detention in the state and gave the state attorney general the power to monitor all state immigration detention centers.\n\nThe state and several local governments including the cities of San Francisco and Sacramento have also set up legal defense funds to help defend immigrants during deportation proceedings.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI\u2019m worried about the \u2018Dreamers,\u2019 hard-working immigrant families and law-abiding people who are just trying to make their way like the rest of us,\u201d Mayor Darrell Steinberg of Sacramento said this year when asked about the state\u2019s sanctuary legislation. \u201cCivil disobedience is a respectful way to show your love for country.\u201d\n\nTensions between local and federal officials reached yet another height last week, when Mayor Libby Schaaf of Oakland publicly warned of coming large-scale immigration arrest operations. Mr. Homan compared the mayor to a \u201cgang lookout yelling, \u201cPolice!\u201d and said she gave people living in the United States illegally a chance to flee. He said her warning meant that the federal immigration authorities arrested about 200 people rather than the 1,000 they had anticipated rounding up.\n\nAlthough Mr. Homan and other federal officials have warned about targeting California as it steps up immigration enforcement efforts, the number of people arrested has not drastically increased so far. In December, the most recent month for which data is available, 1,715 unauthorized immigrants in California were arrested by ICE, compared with 1,379 in December 2016.\n\nThis is not the first time that the Justice Department has sued a state. During the Obama administration, the department filed a civil rights lawsuit against Georgia for segregating students with disabilities from classrooms and sued North Carolina over a bill to restrict bathroom use for transgender citizens. Mr. Sessions withdrew that lawsuit.\n\nIn a call with reporters on Tuesday night, Mr. Becerra said that he was confident California would prevail in court and that state and federal laws were not in conflict.\n\n\u201cIn California, our state laws work in concert with federal law,\u201d he said. \u201cOur teams work together to go after drug dealers and go after gang violence.

We\u2019re in the business of public safety, not deportation.\u201d\n\nMr. Becerra said that he was not surprised by the news of the lawsuit and that the state had already won legal battles against the Trump administration. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen this B-rated movie before,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not doing their bidding on immigration enforcement and deportation.\u201d", "keywords": ["state", "law", "laws", "administration", "enforcement", "immigration", "mr", "federal", "local", "trump", "sues", "california", "states"], "polarity": 0.05902624048930867, "subjectivity": 0.33873720975993693},

North Korea has made such strides in its nuclear and ballistic missile program in recent years that experts say it could agree to a pause in the testing of missiles, while it conducts negotiations, without really damaging its drive to be a bona fide nuclear weapons state.\n\n\u201cThey use negotiations to buy time,\u201d said Christopher R. Hill, who negotiated with North Korea for several years during the Bush administration.\n\nStill, Mr. Hill noted that it was the first time in more than eight years that North Korea had opened the door to negotiating on its nuclear program. Given that, he said the Trump administration should explore the prospect seriously, first by thoroughly debriefing South Korea\u2019s envoys.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe need to chart a course between negative churlishness and irrational exuberance,\u201d Mr. Hill said.\n\nDiplomacy between the United States and North Korea has gone through cycles of long stagnation, followed by brief bursts of hope and then disappointment, typically after North Korea reneged on any agreement. Those collapses have sometimes been accompanied by what Americans have called cheating, but what the North has called prudence.\n\nIn October 1994, Mr. Clinton concluded what was perhaps the most ambitious nuclear agreement ever reached between Washington and Pyongyang \u2014 called, appropriately, the Agreed Framework.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In return, the White House pledged to give North Korea two alternative nuclear power reactors that could not be used in a weapons program \u2014 as well as fuel to tide it over before the new reactors were ready.\n\nThe 1994 accord blocked the North from reprocessing plutonium from its reactor at Yongbyon. The North complied, but then purchased equipment to enrich uranium, another pathway to a bomb, from Abdul Qadeer Khan, one of the fathers of the Pakistani bomb.\n\nThe agreement headed off a threat by North Korea to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, and eased what had been one of the tensest periods on the Korean Peninsula since the armistice that ended the Korean War.\n\nThe Clinton administration tried to expand the Agreed Framework after North Korea began testing ballistic missiles in 1998. That effort culminated with a trip to Pyongyang by Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright in 2000, and what another American official, Wendy Sherman, later wrote were negotiations that came \u201ctantalizingly close\u201d to a broader agreement.\n\nBut no deal was consummated before Mr. Bush took office, and he initiated his own policy review. The disclosure by American intelligence agencies that North Korea was developing a capability to enrich uranium led the Bush administration to conclude that the Agreed Framework was not worth upholding, and construction on the new reactors was suspended.\n\nAt the end of 2002, North Korea expelled inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency, restarted its nuclear facilities and announced it was withdrawing from the nonproliferation treaty. The Agreed Framework was dead.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFrom then on, negotiations occurred within a framework of six parties: North Korea, the United States, South Korea, China, Russia and Japan. Those talks went on fitfully from 2002 to 2005, when North Korea promised to \u201cabandon nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs\u201d in return for \u201csecurity guarantees.\u201d\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s call for \u201csecurity guarantees\u201d in return for denuclearization is nothing new. It has been the basis of almost all previous negotiations with the United States. And it has usually been one of the reasons those efforts have floundered.\n\nAfter years of haggling over how to verify the North Korean pledge, the six-party talks broke down in 2009, leaving Mr. Obama to deal with a North Korea that had made progress in its nuclear program and remained opaque and suspicious of the outside world.\n\nThe Obama administration showed little appetite for reviving the talks, and instead embarked on a policy of steadily tightening economic pressure on North Korea that it called \u201cstrategic patience.\u201d But American diplomats began quietly meeting with their North Korean counterparts.\n\nOn Feb. 29, 2012, the two sides announced a deal \u2014 the so-called Leap Day Agreement \u2014 under which North Korea would halt operations at its Yongbyon nuclear reactor and allow in inspectors to verify its suspension of nuclear and missile testing. In return, the United States pledged to offer food aid to North Korea.\n\nWithin a month North Korea was threatening to launch a satellite, effectively nullifying the deal.\n\nTo a remarkable extent, diplomats said, Mr. Kim is simply reusing the playbook used by his father, Kim Jong-il, and grandfather, Kim Il-sung.\n\n\u201cLook at the pattern,\u201d said Daniel R. Russel, who served as assistant secretary of state for East Asian Affairs in the Obama administration. \u201cDrive the fear factor to a crescendo; at the maximum moment, play the \u2018maybe I can make the pain go away\u2019 game; and then dangle something vague and undefined.\u201d\n\nBut as Daryl G. Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association, noted, \u201cThe difference between March 2018 and 1994 or 2006 or 2012 is that the North Koreans\u2019 price may have gone up significantly.\u201d", "keywords": ["korean", "predecessors", "kim", "finds", "korea", "administration", "negotiations", "north", "position", "nuclear", "mr", "trump", "united", "states"], "polarity": 0.09460649117907183, "subjectivity": 0.3644311781408555},

Sarah Laskow of The Atlantic explained in 2014 that philosophers at this time were, in the words of the sociologist Karl Mannheim, \u201canxious to find a general law to express the rhythm of historical development, based on the biological law of the limited lifetimes of man.\u201d /But understanding societal phenomena through the lens of groups of people born around the same time has always had its limits.\n\nFor example, it\u2019s true that for young men coming-of-age during the Vietnam War, being born in a particular year (and, thanks to the draft lottery, on a particular day) could be life-shaping. But even here, an individual\u2019s class was a factor in whether he actually went to war \u2014 men from privileged backgrounds had many options to avoid the draft, the burden of which fell mainly on the working class.\n\nLike war service, entering the labor market at a time of recession, as most millennials did, can be difficult. But race and class are more important in affecting how this experience plays out for individuals.\n\nTake white millennial college graduates: Yes, they\u2019re part of an age cohort that has experienced worse economic conditions than graduates of the preceding generation \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t give us a particularly meaningful understanding of their plight, given that they are still better off when it comes to income than the average non-college-educated worker of any age.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSome may argue that the generation game, if intellectually vacuous, is basically harmless. But dividing society by generation obscures the real and enduring lines of race, class and gender. When, for example, baby boomers are blamed for \u201cruining America,\u201d the argument lumps together Donald Trump and a 60-year-old black woman who works for minimum wage cleaning one of his hotels.\n\nThe pattern of inherited privilege points to yet another reality that the generation game ignores: the decline of social mobility between generations and the rise of what the French economist Thomas Piketty has called a \u201cpatrimonial society.\u201d When it comes to wealth and its accompanying privileges, the wealth of the previous generation of one\u2019s own family matter more than whether your birth year falls on one or other side of some arbitrary boundary.\n\nToday\u2019s young people may choose political action aimed at reversing these trends or to let them continue and accelerate.

Many Germans and Swedes now recognize \u2014 and some celebrate \u2014 the fact that their fellow citizens can have any skin color or religion. But the attempt to turn countries with monoethnic identities into truly multiethnic nations is a historically unique experiment, and so it should hardly come as a surprise that it has encountered some fierce resistance.\n\nThe situation in Canada and the United States, despite their histories as countries of immigration, has important similarities to that in Europe. Both have historically had rigid racial hierarchies. And in recent decades, both have made real steps toward overcoming these injustices: African-Americans, for example, are better represented in business and government than at any previous point in American history. This has made opposition to a more equal, multiethnic society more fervid among those who feel their privileges threatened. There is a sizable number of Americans for whom the idea of the nation remains synonymous with whiteness and Christianity.\n\nSo long as nationalism is associated with one particular ethnic or religious group, it will serve to exclude and disadvantage others. The only way to keep the destructive potential of nationalism in check is to fight for a society in which collective identity transcends ethnic and religious boundaries \u2014 one in which citizens from all religious or ethnic backgrounds are treated with the same respect as citizens from the majority group.\n\nTo effect this transformation is one of the great political challenges of our age. It requires principled resistance to right-wing nationalism, but it can succeed only if those who are most open to diversity abandon their hostility to other forms of nationalism.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nOne common reaction to the dangerous excesses of nationalism has been to forgo the need for any form of collective identity, exhorting people to transcend tribal allegiances completely. But for better or probably worse, it\u2019s easier to be moved by the suffering of people with whom we have some form of kinship. That is why nationalism remains one of the most powerful vehicles for expanding our circle of sympathy.\n\nAnother common reaction to the resurgence of nationalism has been to celebrate more narrow forms of collective identity, such as race or religion. At a time when many minority groups are under attack, it is, of course, crucial to defend them against discrimination. But it is also important to remember that such groups, too, are capable of oppressing their own members, for example by enforcing restrictive moral codes. That\u2019s why the only way to allow individuals true freedom to lead their lives is to preserve some form of political identity independent of the interests of particular cultural groups.\n\nConvinced that they would be unable to redirect nationalism toward their own ends, many of the most open-minded segments of society long ago gave up on the fight to determine its meaning. In countries like Germany and the United States, advocacy for the victims of prejudice has increasingly bled into a belief that the dark chapters of those countries\u2019 history make any form of nationalism deeply suspect. Instead of exhorting their fellow citizens to live up to their nations\u2019 highest ideals, many activists seem content with denouncing past and present injustices. This has allowed the bigots and racists to bend the meaning of the nation to their own sinister ends.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt\u2019s time to fight back. Nationalism can, and should, be reclaimed for liberals.\n\nA few political leaders have made a valiant start. Barack Obama has been an especially persuasive advocate of the idea that Americans should focus on what unites rather than what divides us and that the symbolism of the nation can inspire hope, even as we reckon with the injustices of American history. \u201cWhat greater expression of faith in the American experiment than this,\u201d Mr. Obama marveled as he stood on the spot in Selma, Ala. where civil rights protesters were beaten in 1965. \u201cWhat greater form of patriotism is there than the belief that America is not yet finished, that we are strong enough to be self-critical, that each successive generation can look upon our imperfections and decide that it is in our power to remake this nation to more closely align with our highest ideals?\u201d\n\nCampaigning for France\u2019s presidency last year, Emmanuel Macron expressed inclusive patriotism in an even more explicit form. \u201cI see Armenians, Italians, Algerians, Moroccans, Tunisians,\u201d he said at a rally in Marseille, a diverse city in southern France, \u201cBut what do I see? I see the people of Marseille! What do I see? I see the people of France!\u201d This, he added in an explicit repudiation of the exclusive nationalism propagated by the far-right National Front party, \u201cis what it means to be proud to be French!\u201d\n\nAmerican \u2014 and to a lesser degree European \u2014 political culture is pregnant with the symbols of inclusive patriotism. But while we have plenty of history to build on, we must also recognize that we are fighting to establish a kind of society for which there is no clear precedent.\n\nIn the United States, the model had once been a melting pot. But asking individuals to conform to one unified culture puts the price of admission to the nation too high. In Canada, the model is often said to be that of a salad bowl, in which the overall dish is enriched by the great variety of individual ingredients. But we can now see that this may be an overly idealized image of a society in which people feel that they have little in common across ethnic and religious divides.\n\nThere may not be a perfect culinary metaphor for the kind of country inclusive nationalists seek to create. But its contours should be obvious. It is a state in which all members have the same rights and opportunities irrespective of the group into which they are born or the culture to which they belong. It is a society in which people feel that they have something important in common because they seek to govern themselves together, pledge to help one another in an hour of need and recognize that these shared commitments are ultimately more consequential than any difference of color or creed. And it is a culture that does not shy away from celebrating the nobility of this collective identity \u2014 embracing the nation\u2019s flag not because we claim never to have failed our compatriots in the past but because we aspire to realize a common future fair to all.\n\nIt would be tempting to say that this kind of patriotism has little in common with the nationalism that is now ascendant around the world. Patriotism, some philosophers argue, should be understood as an innocent love of country that is inclusive at home and cooperative abroad. Nationalism, by contrast, excludes other ethnicities and stands in competition with the interests of other countries.\n\nBut it is too clever by half to pretend that we can safely stoke the good aspects of patriotism without ever running the danger of exacerbating the worst aspects of nationalism. For the kind of patriotism I am proposing is not a completely different form of collective identity; it is, rather, one that proudly stands in competition with the exclusionary politics on display from Washington to Moscow to Beijing.\n\nNationalism is like a half-wild beast. As long as it remains under our control, it can be of tremendous use. But if we abandon it, others are sure to step in, prodding and baiting the beast to bring out its most ferocious side. For all the well-founded misgivings about it, we have little choice but to domesticate it as best we can.", "keywords": ["reclaim", "religious", "common", "political", "liberals", "form", "identity", "society", "nation", "collective", "patriotism", "nationalism"], "polarity": 0.14129125602529854, "subjectivity": 0.47932204517310895},

The powerful message was that this black man and his white fianc\u00e9e were facing her family (and the world) and saying that was O.K.

The show, which I saw reruns of as a child in the 1980s, introduced ideas like culture clash; it lightly made fun of American cluelessness about other countries, in the figures of Fred and Ethel.\n\nA comic genius, Lucy used slapstick and crocodile tears to combat her husband\u2019s machismo \u2014 and when you look at how Latina actors in her position are still forced to play stereotypes of the docile wife or the sexy spitfire, that still looks radical today.\n\n\u2014 Annie Correal, reporter, metropolitan news\n\nI am not athletic, British or Indian. But Parminder Nagra, who played Jess Bhamra in \u201cBend it Like Beckham,\u201d was close enough.

Those were also the years when the \u201cmodel minority\u201d myth was really grating me, and I was drawn to transgressive portrayals of Asians. Jon Moritsugu\u2019s movies, in all their anarchic glory, were a revelation, especially \u201cTerminal U.S.A.,\u201d which somehow made it onto TV in the 1990s despite all its gore and drug use.\n\nLater, Justin Lin\u2019s \u201cBetter Luck Tomorrow\u201d depicted a group of Asian-American high-school students who fall into a world of crime.

{"title": "\n                    New Y.A. Books by Women of Color Rewrite Old Cultural Scripts                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/02/books/review/ya-women-of-color-clayton-adeyemi.html", "text": "Now, more than anytime in recent history, we\u2019re hearing the triumphant roar of women of color as they break down longstanding barriers in art, film and literature. In young adult literature in particular, inventive, international stories told in newly empowered women\u2019s voices are claiming their rightful place at the table. Take these five new Y.A. books, ranging from fantasy to realistic fiction to memoir. In these authors\u2019 hands, non-Western sensibilities might reign in a vivid and original Yoruban religion-based world, or classical settings might be reinterpreted to create a universe in which beauty is not tied to race. A heartbreaking fictional front row seat to the Syrian refugee emergency is offset by a humorous true tale of growing up an Iranian-American immigrant without a green card. And a very modern romance proves that, despite divides both cultural and digital, love still wins. So do Y.A. readers, when it comes to seeing exhilaratingly new kinds of characters sharing space.\n\nIn Dhonielle Clayton\u2019s lavish fantasy THE BELLES (Freeform, $17.99; ages 14 to 17), a thing of beauty is only temporary. The decadent island society of Orl\u00e9ans is home to a select group of sisters born with the disconcerting ability to perform plastic surgery without the plastic. As \u201cdescendants of the goddess of beauty,\u201d the Belles have a fuzzily explained magical \u201carcana\u201d in their blood that allows them to temporarily change the physical appearance of the native Gris, who are cursed with gray skin and red eyes. After a childhood of training, the teenage Belles are introduced to upper-class society and tasked with transforming the hair, skin and bone structure of the race-fluid rich and royal. But when the rebellious Belle Camellia uncovers a plot by the truly vile Princess Sophia to enslave her and her sisters, she sows the seeds of a grass-roots revolution that is bound to blossom more fully in the inevitable sequel.\n\nPhoto\n\nClayton, a co-founder of the We Need Diverse Books organization, has created an opulent mash-up setting, which seems to be a cherry-picked combination of 18th-century France, Japan and the antebellum American South. If it never quite coalesces into a seamless cultural whole, readers seduced by the page-turning palace intrigue and the vivid food and clothing descriptions won\u2019t notice or care.\n\nMagic also lies dormant in the platelets of chosen teenagers in the Nigerian-American Tomi Adeyemi\u2019s debut, CHILDREN OF BLOOD AND BONE (Holt, $18.99; ages 12 and up). But these diviners are no debutantes. Born with snow white hair and deep brown skin in the imaginary country of Or\u00efsha, young diviners morph into mighty, magic-wielding maji, or magicians, at 13. For centuries they relied on their powers (which Adeyemi based on aspects of the religion of the Yoruban people of West Africa). All that ended when the nonmagical King Saran ordered the slaughter of all adult majis. But when a mysterious scroll falls into the hands of Amari, a defiant princess, and Z\u00e9lie, a tenacious diviner warrior, the two young women set out on a thrilling, death-defying journey to restore magic and take back the throne.\n\nPhoto\n\nBlack Girl Magic, indeed! It\u2019s no surprise that this epic trilogy opener has already been optioned for film. Full of cinematic action sequences (the most memorable of them set almost entirely underwater and employing an army of the dead) and creatures worthy of Star Wars (horse-size \u201clionaires\u201d have saber teeth and horns), it storms the boundaries of the imagination. Yet it also confronts the conscience. Adeyemi\u2019s brutally depicted war between the noble, lighter-skinned kosidans and the enslaved, darker-skinned majis poses thought-provoking questions about race, class and authority that hold up a warning mirror to our sharply divided society.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Tareq is a Syrian refugee whose perilous journey is narrated by the voice of Destiny, characterized as a kindly, prosaic entity. After Tareq\u2019s mother, grandmother and four of his siblings are killed by a bomb, he and his father flee to Turkey with his remaining sister, Susan. They hopscotch from Turkey to Greece, Serbia, Slovenia, Austria and finally to Germany, where he finds a fragile safety. Along the way he witnesses beheadings and drownings, but also experiences the kindness of aid workers like Alexia, an American student. Abawi, a foreign news correspondent, does an admirable job of showing the grim horror of refugee life. But her efforts are occasionally undermined by cartoonish villains (\u201cYou tink you will be saved? Who will save you? Captain America is not real, just movies\u201d) and by some of Destiny\u2019s well-meaning but obvious platitudes: \u201cWhen you truly love someone, their life means more to you than your own.\u201d These interruptions may pull readers out of the story, though perhaps that distance is necessary for adolescents trying to process something as bleak and overwhelming as the Syrian refugee crisis.\n\nPhoto\n\nOf course, once refugees finally arrive in their adopted country, new problems arise. Until she was 13, Sara Saedi, an Iranian-American television writer and the author of the memoir AMERICANIZED: Rebel Without a Green Card (Random House, $17.99, ages 12 and up), was cheerfully oblivious of her family\u2019s immigration status. After her older sister breaks the news that they are \u201cillegal,\u201d Saedi suffers through the usual teenage rites of passage at her Silicon Valley high school (unibrow management, pimple wars, pot smoking) with the added pressure of possible deportation hanging over her head. Saedi adroitly and humorously uses these universal pubescent ordeals to contextualize Iranian culture and the immigrant experience. A memory of being teased about her eyebrow in ninth grade expands into a discussion of beauty norms: When her mother praises her for being hairless, \u201cshe meant by Persian woman standards. I was still hairy by everyone else\u2019s standards.\u201d And she has the sobering realization that pot is a privilege American teenagers can enjoy, but not undocumented kids: \u201cIf I got caught, I\u2019d have a criminal record that could be grounds for deportation.\u201d Very funny but never flippant, Saedi mixes \u201990s pop culture references, adolescent angst and Iranian history into an intimate, informative narrative that thoroughly defies current divisive views on immigration.\n\nPhoto\n\nMary H.K. Choi\u2019s blushingly tender and piquant debut novel, EMERGENCY CONTACT (Simon & Schuster, $17.99; ages 14 and up), about two isolated, misfit college students from Austin who fall in love via text message explores our emotional rather than geographical divides. In \u201cEmergency Contact,\u201d a Korean-American would-be writer named Penny keeps everyone at a distance, the result of living with a single, oversharing mom she calls \u201cthe equivalent of \u2026 human glitter.\u201d But when she rescues Sam, a half-German, half-Polish student filmmaker, from the sidewalk during a panic attack, she becomes his \u201cemergency contact,\u201d and he hers. Their charged, initial banter on text soon develops into increasingly personal exchanges about art, death, unstable moms and pregnant ex-girlfriends. Yet their burgeoning bond keeps stalling out. Burned by past relationships and millennial-ly tethered to their devices, they struggle to connect romantically IRL. Sam \u201ccouldn\u2019t imagine the space Penny would take up in his life if she sprang out of his phone,\u201d and Penny admits \u201cSam was her phone and her phone was Sam.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nChoi, a culture correspondent for HBO\u2019s Vice News, inserts timely issues like sexual assault, cultural appropriation and even DACA into her characters\u2019 intimate conversations, but it is her examination of digital vs. F2F communication that feels the most immediate. Has digital communication become so ubiquitous, and interpersonal contact so arduous, that we\u2019d rather type than talk? Thankfully, no.

She takes comfort from local efforts like a project in Utica, N.Y., where Bosnian Muslim immigrants and local Unitarian Christians watched a Super Bowl together.

In her introduction, Chua remarked that the United States as a supertribal entity indifferent to ethnicity and culture became at best a partial reality only a generation ago. By book\u2019s end, however, the battered ideal has been polished and refurbished.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Will we, telling ourselves \u2018These immigrants are different,\u2019 be the weak link, the first generation to fail? Will we forget who we are?\u201d That\u2019s inspiring, and even more so are the citations of Martin Luther King Jr., Lin-Manuel Miranda and Langston Hughes that finish the book.\n\nInspiring \u2014 but not wholly reassuring. A lot of the interest of \u201cPolitical Tribes\u201d comes from the strong sense it emanates of an author arguing with herself. Chua both condemns tribalism and respects its power. She insists that the United States alone of nations among the earth has often transcended it \u2014 and then presents impressive contrary evidence from the past and the present. Chua reckons with the many tribalisms of the American past: ethnic, religious and racial. She hopes for a future in which tribalism fades \u2014 even as she mercilessly details its accumulating strength.\n\nAs Chua notes, tribes can coalesce out of previously unrelated pieces. Immigrants to Europe from North Africa, the Middle East and South Asia \u2014 of different languages, ethnicities, folkways and religious practices \u2014 raised children who created for themselves a new identity as post-ethnic Muslims. ISIS, as Chua mordantly observes, is in its own way a melting pot, bringing together young men and women from across Europe, Asia and the Americas to fight for a new ideology. She quotes a New York Times article about young British girls lured to ISIS. For them, \u201cIslam is punk rock.\u201d\n\nTribes can be created by fission as well as by fusion. Chua suggests that in the United States, divisions that would once have been understood as class divides have been reinterpreted in our time as cultural, even when they are not ethnic. \u201cWhite Americans often hold their biggest disdain for other white Americans \u2014 the ones on the opposite side of the cultural divide.\u201d\n\nThese fast-evolving and ever-changing identities may look contingent from the outside. They feel overwhelmingly powerful to those inside. Chua repeatedly scolds American policymakers for underestimating the importance of ethnocultural identity in Vietnam in the 1960s, Venezuela in the 1990s and Afghanistan in the 2000s. Through her book pulses an evident worry that tribal claims are now overpowering national ones within the United States. If she cannot quite bring herself to make her own anxieties explicit \u2014 or figure out what if anything to do to address them \u2014 she is hardly alone.

Otto Kerner of Illinois.\n\nPresident Lyndon Johnson had established the commission to examine the disorders and violent protests in Detroit, Newark and well over 100 other American cities during the summer of 1967, and earlier. What it found was searing. \u201cWhat white Americans have never fully understood \u2013 but what the Negro can never forget \u2013 is that white society is deeply implicated in the ghetto,\u201d the commission concluded. \u201cWhite institutions created it, white institutions maintain it, and white society condones it.\u201d\n\nMostly moderate and mostly white men, the members of the bipartisan panel carried the imprimatur of the political establishment. Their recommendations attracted widespread public debate.

The overall poverty rate remains about the same today as it was 50 years ago; the total number of poor people has increased from over 25 million to well over 40 million, more than the population of California.\n\nMeanwhile, the rich have profited at the expense of most working Americans. Today, the top 1 percent receive 52 percent of all new income. Rich people are healthier and live longer. They get a better education, which produces greater gains in income. And their greater economic power translates into greater political power.\n\nFive Indicators America of the 1960s contrasted with the most recent available data.

I\u2019d love to jump right in and hear your aspirations for Prairie View. What do you hope to accomplish in your time as president? I assume you had many offers to lead other colleges. Why was Prairie View different?\n\nRuth Simmons: Well, I\u2019m a native of Texas, and one of the things that I did when I returned to Houston after I retired from Brown was think about the ways I could use my experience to help the community. I started with small ventures in the city, but I hadn\u2019t thought really that another university would be in my life. But when I was approached by Prairie View, I thought immediately about its significant impact on my brother, who went there. And what Dillard did for me.\n\nI grew up in a segregated neighborhood in Grapeland, Tex., with very little experience with the world. The transition that Dillard enabled for me was extremely valuable. As an undergraduate, I began to grow a sense of confidence that helped me move from a fairly insular environment to a bigger stage when I went to graduate school.\n\nMy aspirations for Prairie View are to essentially make sure the university is continuing to do the same thing for students today that it did for my brother \u2014 and Dillard did for me. And that is to offer the advantage of a strong education that will prepare students for the careers they want, in a social and cultural context that helps them develop the confidence to perform after graduation.\n\nAs president, that means focusing on time-honored strategies to success that apply to universities everywhere: worrying about the faculty who are recruited here, the campus experience, and whether we are providing the leadership and internship opportunities that students need. It means worrying about the reputation of the university. It\u2019s obviously a much more competitive world today than it was when I was a student, but the underlying work to move the university to a level of achievement that makes students and alumni proud is the same.\n\nM.J.: What do you see as some of the major challenges facing historically black colleges and universities?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nR.S.: The general challenge for H.B.C.U.s is not unlike the problem many universities face today, and that is the financial model. Being tuition dependent has become a large problem for all universities. H.B.C.U.s are dependent on raising money, but that is a reality that most universities obviously face. So it very much depends on the question of whether the schools have a good-enough foundation because of secure financing. When it comes to the federal government\u2019s role in supporting H.B.C.U.s, I think we don\u2019t yet understand the extent to which they will be affected by the changes in Washington today. To say that many are not hopeful in this moment is an understatement. We just don\u2019t know.\n\nFrankly, that\u2019s why I advocate for developing enough financial independence to secure the future of our institutions. That means looking for different revenue streams, looking to increase our ability to raise funds and finding alternate programs that help to bring more income into our university. The only strategy cannot be to persistently raise tuition, making college outside the reach of many families.\n\nM.J.: You\u2019ve led several institutions that are all very different from each other, and the topic of leadership is something you\u2019ve talked a lot about. In another interview with The Times you said that it\u2019s much easier to lead people \u201cif you convey the underlying principles.\u201d Can you elaborate?\n\nR.S.: One thing that I\u2019ve learned is that the perceptions of what it takes to be a leader are often based on prototypical models that don\u2019t have much truth in reality. People look at the institutions that I have led and they see dissimilarities. I see similarities. When people think in terms of leadership, they\u2019re often thinking about the kind of specific skills needed for different types of enterprises. I think of leadership as more of a disposition \u2014 the ability to step into a situation to learn about the history of the enterprise, the opportunities that it faces, the culture that exists and the people who are served by it. To look at all of that, to listen to stakeholders and then to think about how that enterprise or institution should best be served. There is no one model of leadership if you approach it that way. What I have tried to do wherever I go is to start where the institution is rather than try to import particularly rigid constructs from other places. In that sense, I think a leader is more than anything else a facilitator. A person who is able to come in to show a community a picture of what it is, to provide some insight into what it could be \u2014 how it could be different or improved perhaps \u2014 and then enlist the help of people who are there and others who support that institution in order to move forward together.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

I don\u2019t see that. I think leadership is a community affair.\n\nM.J.: That makes sense. So how do you approach educating the current generation of students at Prairie View to lead in the way you described?\n\nR.S.: People today are fond of leadership programs that theorize about the profile and tenets of leadership. And students anxiously get involved in those programs. I rather think that our entire campuses are incubators of leadership even without the formality of such programs because if we\u2019re doing what we should be doing, we are acclimating students to an environment in which they have to learn to work with others who are very different from themselves. And that seems to me to be the first requirement of leadership. To actually learn to work with people in a respectful and inclusive way is inordinately important. A campus provides one of the best opportunities for people to be able to do that because you sit in class alongside people whom you initially don\u2019t know. You are discussing your ideas, having people respond to them and often rejecting what you\u2019re saying. You are joining organizations that have certain aims that are being advanced by the collective, so you\u2019re learning how to facilitate. You are asked to step into leadership roles either through student government or organizations. Even in the classroom context you might play a leadership role. You have to learn to express yourself, to be convincing, to write out your ideas, to be more thoughtful than you\u2019d ordinarily be. All of those things are components of leadership.\n\nM.J.: Some would argue that social media, or perhaps disagreements over the concept of safe spaces, have made it more challenging for people to come together and to work together.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nR.S.: Yeah, I would say that people frequently say that, but that has certainly not been my experience. I would say that in my days as a student, the tensions were higher, the disagreements were greater, the separation among us was certainly more pronounced. And people are kind of inventing a new narrative, that things are so much worse today than they were in the past. I don\u2019t buy that. I think we have new terminology, because the modern sciences of psychology and sociology and so forth and modern media have enabled us to peer into areas that we were not able to see as easily as before. And so when you have social media and all of the ways in which people can now say whatever they want to say \u2014 in an unartful or offensive way \u2014 that turns the volume up to be sure. But it doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t there before.\n\nI would say that the current situation ought to give us much more practice in how to engage with each other because it is not underground. It\u2019s out front, it\u2019s in the open. The media today and the things that are being reported should be upsetting or troubling to students, my goodness. But it may be an even better opportunity to engage students.\n\nAs a teacher, as an educator, I would say these times are especially fertile for teaching the skills that are needed in a world in which there are many types of people, many perspectives and so forth. Students don\u2019t need to feel silenced by the current situation. When students at Brown came to me and said, you know, they were hurt because somebody asked them about their hair, and they were tired of that and they didn\u2019t want any part of it, I would say, \u201cWell, that\u2019s just too bad!\u201d Somebody asked you about your hair, tell them about your hair. You are in college not to hide from that. You\u2019re there to teach the world about yourself, you\u2019re there to learn about others and to teach them about who you are. So I\u2019d rather think this whole notion of protecting people from that is something that we have to take in hand and deal with. And help students see the opportunity in that because if they engage with people who have those kinds of perspectives, they are going to be much stronger in the end than if they run away.\n\nM.J.: Do you see the situation differently for students at H.B.C.U.s? You mentioned that Dillard gave you the space to learn and build confidence before heading to graduate school.\n\nR.S.: There is a narrative that many people have for H.B.C.U.s. People see them as a monolith, or only see them as filling a gap that exists for African-Americans. H.B.C.U.s are not a brand. They are institutions with a certain history \u2014 they were originally set up basically to insure that there would be two separate systems for education \u2014 but they are not all alike, and are very diverse in what they offer.\n\nPrairie View, for example, is the second-oldest public institution of higher education in the state of Texas. It was set up basically to insure that there would be two separate systems for ex-slaves and whites. For a long time it provided educational opportunities for black students that wouldn\u2019t have been open to them otherwise. In nursing, architecture, engineering and other STEM fields at a time when many blacks were not able to go into those areas, the university was able to facilitate the entry of blacks into those professions.\n\nM.J.: Yes, this is something that Nikole Hannah-Jones has written about for The New York Times Magazine, in particular how Xavier University of Louisiana sends more black students to medical school than almost any other college in the country. I read that Prairie View has many more students who graduate with degrees in architecture and engineering.\n\nR.S.: Yes, going to Dillard is not like going to Prairie View. So the student who chooses to go to one H.B.C.U. may not find another appealing. That has to do with the unique features of the place, the academic culture and so on, the traditions. All of that makes a big difference.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen I went off to college, I was just trying to find a place where I could be a student without impediments that in that day and time were fairly widely known to be substantial if you enrolled in a majority-white institution. There was no question that in 1963, if you went off to college in the South, you had to be very careful about where you studied. The racial dynamic was very challenging at that time. One of the things I\u2019m learning now is that many of the students I speak to at Prairie View today have the same kinds of thoughts that I had those many years ago. They ask themselves, where can I feel comfortable so that I don\u2019t have to worry about anything but my academic work? So certainly that plays a factor in why students apply to H.B.C.U.s. And for some H.B.C.U.s, applications are way up. But if you reach the point where you think that a category of institutions are the right choice for you \u2014 going to an H.B.C.U. just to go to an H.B.C.U. \u2014 then you\u2019re not thinking broadly enough.\n\nM.J.: As you look across the landscape of higher education, what other challenges do college students face today?\n\nR.S.: I guess I worry a lot about our students having the skills and the experience to promote respectful interactions with a wide-ranging group of people. Students can be quite passionate about what they see on the national scene and how sometimes dangerous they think it is \u2014 how unpleasant it is and so forth. But we\u2019ve got to try to find a way on our campuses not to taint the national picture as hopeless, or as being antithetical to anything that we can think of as good and admirable. The last thing we want is for our students to bow out and decide that it isn\u2019t worth trying to do anything about a hopeless situation.\n\nAnd I do think that civility goes hand in hand with being hopeful. Hopeful that the next person you meet you will be able to converse with you in a respectful way. Hopeful that the next election cycle is going to give you a chance to be engaged and able to do something that makes you feel a sense of your own agency. Hopeful that the things will get better rather than worse.\n\nSo much of what we have to do on our campuses is really to hold open the possibility for people that civil society will in the end right itself \u2014 if enough of us are engaged. I am so thankful every day for the fact that I grew up in a time when nobody thought blacks would be able to be integrated into American society, they would never be able to hold important positions, they\u2019d never be respected intellectually, they\u2019d never be able to do the things that they are now able to do.

They are quiet, almost too much so. But once you learn what happened in these scenes from small towns, big cities or verdant fields, their almost unemotional first impression gives way to horror: Someone was lynched there.\n\nStarting in 2016, Mr. Clasper traveled through the United States seeking the sites of lynchings. He wanted to show how places that call no attention to themselves were the sites of hangings, slashings or execution by gunfire. In the course of covering 24 sites, they span 150 years, right up to the present century, and range from the American south to New York City.\n\n\u201cFrom my perspective, I take it back to 1903, when the American scholar and activist W.E.B. Du Bois said the problem of the 20th century is the problem of the color line,\u201d Mr. Clasper said. \u201cIt seems to me not a lot has changed despite significant advances. There has been barely a year or generation that has passed where racism and violence have not been at the forefront of the American experience.\u201d\n\nAs the London-born son of a British mother and American father, Mr. Clasper said he had \u201ca deep spiritual connection to the American landscape.\u201d In this series \u2014 titled \u201cThe Spaces We Inherit\u201d \u2014 he hopes to gently confront viewers in a way that eschews graphic images of violence.\n\n\u201cI took a different approach and focused on the spaces to encourage people to look at this history from an altered perspective,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve become desensitized to images of violence. But everything that happen s has to happen somewhere.\u201d\n\nGiven the persisting tensions over racial and religious prejudice, Mr. Clasper wants to gently provoke a necessary conversation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to investigate these deep-seated issues in America,\u201d he said. \u201cI think many agree that the nation has not dealt with its bloody past of lynchings and segregation. It seemed to me there has been no collective acceptance, let alone recognition of the mistakes made and the sins committed.\u201d\n\nInterviews were conducted by Oliver Clasper and have been edited for brevity.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Jesse Lee Bond, Arlington, Tenn., 1939\n\nOn April 28, 1939, a local sharecropper named Jesse Lee Bond was shot to death in broad daylight by employees of SY Wilson, a local hardware store. Jesse Lee Bond had asked for an invoice the day before after purchasing goods on credit, something that was no\u0095t done by African-Americans at that time as keeping sharecroppers in the dark about how much they had spent was one way for white owners to keep their workers in constant debt. The day of Jesse Lee Bond\u2019s murder he was ordered back to the store. His aunt accompanied him and witnessed the whole thing. \u201cThey shot at him and shot him. He ran out to the outhouse. They riddled the outhouse. And when he staggered out of the outhouse, they threw him down, castrated him, and dragged him to the river,\u0095\u201d she said. The family was told he had drowned accidentally.\n\nImage\n\nSylvester Lewis, Memphis\n\n\u201cI remember my cousin Jesse well. I was 9 when he was killed and he was 20. What I heard was that there had been a dispute at the SY Wilson general store over in Arlington. Jesse insisted on a receipt, but this is something they didn\u2019\u0095t do. I think whoever he was negotiating with relented, but I think the people over him, the father of the individual in question, didn\u2019\u0095t like it. They went to his home and said they wanted to talk to him and ordered him back to the store. When he returned they attacked him. He tried to run for his life but they caught up with him and shot him. I also heard that they dragged his body behind a vehicle and then dumped him in the river. The descendants are running the store now, and I\u2019\u0095m not sure they know what happened. The ones who were allegedly involved in the lynching passed a long time ago, but their relations are still in Arlington. I don\u2019t think there\u2019\u0095s any resentment now. Anyone who hears about it can\u2019\u0095t understand how that could happen. They simply can\u2019t relate to that kind of criminal activity.\u201d\n\nInterviewed November 2016.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Emmett Till, Drew, Miss., 1955.\n\nIn what is one of the most significant race-related events in the history of the United States, Emmett Till, a 14-year-old Chicago native, was brutally lynched in rural Mississippi on Aug. 28, 1955. Till, who had been visiting family members in the area, entered a local white-owned grocery store in the town of Money for less than one minute. Whatever was said between him and the proprietor, Carolyn Bryant, was used as the pretext for his murder. Four days later Till was abducted from his uncle\u2019\u0095s house by Roy Bryant, Carolyn\u2019\u0095s husband, and J.W. Milam and driven to a nearby barn where he was severely beaten and tortured (the original wall of the barn can be seen on the left of the photograph). He was then taken to the Tallahatchie River, shot in the head, and drowned with a cotton gin fan tied around his neck. In an infamous court case both defendants were found \u0094not guilty\u0095 by an all-white jury. Months later they sold their story and admitted their guilt, with Bryant claiming that the Supreme Court decision Brown v. Board of Education that desegregated schools was a mistake. Emmett Till\u2019s mother, Mamie Till Bradley, allowed photos to be taken of her son\u2019s broken and swollen body because she \u201cwanted the world to see what they did to my baby.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nDr. Jeffrey Andrews, Drew, Miss.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know the history of the property when I purchased it in 2003 and it was only two years later that a few local people told me of the Emmett Till murder. I\u2019ve lived in Drew since I was 12 and I had never heard of it. I\u2019ve since modified the barn to make it more functional and useful, and someone once asked me why I would change a historical site, but history is in the past and people should move on. Things have changed drastically here in the Mississippi Delta region and race relations are at all-time high. History is an important learning tool and it should be used to help people move forward, but one thing you have to remember is that people here don\u2019t want to be constantly reminded of how things were 60 years ago. We\u2019ve all moved forward, and sometimes people aren\u2019t given enough credit for the changes we\u2019ve made. I respect everyone\u2019s feelings towards Emmett Till, and I\u2019ve met some of his family members. They\u2019re great people. This has been a learning experience for my family and we appreciate the fact that we\u2019re part of a historical site.\u201d\n\nInterviewed March 2017.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Joe Coe, Omaha, 1891\n\nOn Oct. 10, 1891, a 50-year-old African-American named Joe Coe (also known as George Smith) was accused of sexually assaulting a 5-year-old girl and was quickly arrested. Rumors spread that the girl had died and that Coe would get off lightly, neither of which was true. A frenzied mob seized him from the jail at the Douglas County Courthouse, put a rope around his neck, and dragged his body through the streets. Coe was then hanged from a streetcar wire on the corner of 17th and Harney in front of thousands of onlookers. Souvenirs of the rope were later sold. Mayor Richard C. Cushing of Omaha condemned the lynching as \u201c\u0094the most deplorable thing that has ever happened in the history of the country.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Ell Persons, Memphis, 1917\n\nWhen the decapitated body of a 16-year-old local, Antoinette Rappel, was found near the old Wolf River Bridge in May 1917, Ell Persons, a local black woodcutter, was deemed a possible suspect. Despite being arrested and released twice, he was captured a third time and forced to confess. A local mob announced that he was to be lynched the next day. The news spread, and a crowd of 3,000 turned up to witness his lynching (including students of Central High School). Ell Persons was burned on a makeshift pyre in a carnival-like atmosphere. He was then decapitated, and his head was taken to the predominantly African-American Beale Street and thrown at locals. A century later his lynching was commemorated and a historic marker was erected near the site.\n\nImage\n\nAmal Altareb, Memphis\n\n\u201cI came to America in 2012 from Yemen. I\u2019m still learning the language and the history, and it wasn\u2019t until the spring of last year that I learned about lynchings. I knew some of the history of segregation and Jim Crow laws, and I knew how unfair the system was \u2014 that African-Americans weren\u2019t treated as equals \u2014 but I didn\u2019t know that human beings had been burned or hanged from a tree just because of their race. Last year my class at Central High School were discussing it and I asked what lynchings were and they were surprised that I didn\u2019t know. It\u2019s surprising that humans can go so far as to kill someone else in this way and create a festival-like atmosphere. There were even spectators. Uncovering the truth is painful, but it\u2019s important. The African-American students especially don\u2019t talk about it because it\u2019s painful, and it reminds them of the injustices towards their race. White Americans don\u2019t want to remember either because of the guilt they feel. I can understand why people want to avoid the topic, but we need to face history in order to move forward.\u201d\n\nInterviewed October 2016.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Leo Frank, Marietta, Ga., 1915\n\nMary Phagan, 13, was found dead on April 26, 1913, at a National Pencil Company factory where she worked. Amid an atmosphere of anti-Semitism and despite conflicting evidence, a Jewish superintendent named Leo Frank was convicted of the crime. Frank\u2019s sentence was later commuted from the death penalty to life imprisonment, a decision that led a mob on Aug. 17, 1915, to seize him from state prison and lynch him from a tree in Marietta, Mary Phagan\u2019s hometown. Later that year the second chapter of the Ku Klux Klan was founded on Stone Mountain, with a number of Leo Frank\u2019s murderers present. Leo Frank was posthumously pardoned in 1986.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of George W. Murray, Mae Murray Dorsey, Roger Malcom and Dorothy Malcolm, Walton County, Georgia, 1946\n\nAfter Roger Malcom, a World War II veteran and Georgia sharecropper, had been bailed out of jail after allegedly stabbing a white man, members of the local community decided to take revenge. On July 25, 1946, a mob of 15 to 20 stopped the car Malcom was riding in with his wife, Dorothy, and another couple, George W. Murray and Mae Murray Dorsey, who was pregnant. They tied the four of them to a nearby tree and shot them to death. Mae Murray Dorsey then had her unborn baby ripped out of her. Despite an F.B.I. investigation nobody was brought to trial for the crime, and a few months later a grand jury was \u201cunable to establish the identity of any persons guilty of violating the civil rights statute of the United States.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nCeleste Butler, Omaha\n\n\u201cTracing one\u2019s roots and one\u2019s history is hard, especially as an African-American. These are big questions we all want to know: Who are we and where do we come from? I had DNA testing done recently but it didn\u2019t lead anywhere. It just told me that my ancestors came from West Africa, but it couldn\u2019t say where exactly. Missing that part and not being able to hand it down to my children or grandchildren is frustrating. On top of that you hear some people in this country telling black people to \u2018go back home.\u2019 Home to what? Home to whom? It feels like a total assault both mentally and physically to have chapters and generations missing. Not being able to fill that void is difficult. When it comes to racial violence I feel like we\u2019re constantly suffering from PTSD. It\u2019s a stress that never really goes away. A lot of people suffer in pain and in silence, and they suffer for successive generations. Everything was stripped from us, and we\u2019ve been struggling to put the pieces back together ever since.\u201d\n\nInterviewed September 2017.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Michael Donald, Mobile, Ala., 1981\n\nMichael Donald, 19, was abducted on March 21, 1981, by Henry Hays and James Knowles as he was walking home. They beat him, slit his throat, and hanged his body from a tree outside 114 Herndon Avenue. The pretext for Donald\u2019s murder was a \u201cnot guilty\u201d verdict handed down by a partially black jury to an African-American man accused of killing a white police officer. This incensed the Alabama chapter of the Ku Klux Klan, led by Benny Jack Hays, the father of Henry Hays, who suggested killing a random black person in response. Michael Donald\u2019s mother, Beulah Mae Donald, with the help of the Southern Poverty Law Center, brought a case not just against the killers but also the United Klans of America. Beulah Mae Donald won the case and received $7 million in damages, essentially bankrupting the U.K.A. Henry Hays was executed, while Knowles received life imprisonment. Hays is the only known Klan member to have been executed in the 20th century for the murder of an African-American. Herndon Avenue has since been renamed Michael Donald Avenue and a historic marker has been erected.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Mulugeta Seraw, Portland, Ore., 1988\n\nOn the evening of Nov. 13, 1988, an Ethiopian student named Mulugeta Seraw was being dropped off at his apartment when he was attacked by Kenneth Mieske, Kyle Brewster and Steve Strasser, members of a local racist skinhead group called East Side White Pride. Mieske delivered the fatal blows with a baseball bat. He was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. In 1990 Seraw\u2019s family, represented by the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League, brought a civil lawsuit against the killers\u2019 affiliated group, the White Aryan Nation, and its leaders, Tom and John Metzger, for $12.5 million. Tom Metzger later said that the killers had done their \u201ccivic duty\u201d by killing Seraw.\n\nImage\n\nJason Downard, Portland, Ore.\n\n\u201cWhen I was 2 I was put into foster care, and in 2009 I went to prison for a gang-affiliated drive-by shooting. I didn\u2019t grow up racist, but in prison the racist skinheads pulled me into their group and drilled stuff into my head about how the media is run by Jews and that they wanted an all-white nation. I also got a tattoo of a swastika on my leg, which I\u2019ve since had covered up. It\u2019s a painful reminder. The skinheads showed me support and love and compassion, which I hadn\u2019t experienced before in my life; everyone is looking for some kind of acceptance. I was angry and uncomfortable with who I was, and I drove that anger towards people who didn\u2019t look like me. In the last two years of the movement my sister had a son with a black guy and my nephew would give me this look like he knew what I was about. I started to get a guilty conscience and began to think about the things I thought I believed in. My sister said I\u2019d been brainwashed, and I can see why. The movement just taught me to hate and reinforced those views. The problem of racism in this country is much deeper than many people think. When it comes to Trump, he\u2019s tacitly endorsed the alt-right and white supremacists. It\u2019s been a ripple effect and things have gotten worse since he came into power. The right now feel emboldened. I look back now at some of the things I\u2019ve done and I realize that I\u2019ve hurt a lot of people. I decided I wanted to help others who had been in a similar position to me, and that\u2019s been my mission ever since. Now I work for an organization called Life After Hate. I\u2019m a marked man, and maybe I\u2019ll die doing this, but at least I\u2019ll die knowing I did the right thing.\u201d\n\nInterviewed October 2017.\n\nImage\n\nThe Murder Site of Timothy Caughman, New York City, 2017\n\nOn March 17, 2017 James Harris Jackson traveled from his home in Baltimore to New York City with the intention of killing random black men. The reason, he later told police, was his hatred of interracial relationships. Three days later he found Timothy Caughman, 66, collecting cans in a trash bin on the corner of West 36th and 9th Avenue and stabbed him multiple times with an 18-inch sword. Caughman died of his injuries that night, and two days later Jackson turned himself in, telling police that he had planned to kill more black men in Times Square. On March 27, Jackson was charged with one count each of murder in the first and second degrees as an act of terrorism, second-degree murder as a hate crime, and three counts of criminal possession of a weapon.\n\n\u201cThe Spaces We Inherit,\u201d which will be published as a book by Overlapse in October 2018, is available for pre-order.\n\nFollow @nytimesphoto on Twitter.

Though his inquiry is intensely, at times painfully personal, Mr. Wilkerson is above all concerned with unpacking the mechanisms of racial domination. The procedure is akin to performing surgery on a half-conscious subject, or digging up a buried land mine that has lost little of its explosive power.\n\nVideo\n\nThe focus of his excavation is a killing that took place in Dothan, Ala., in 1946, when S.E. Branch, a white shopkeeper, shot Bill Spann, a black man who was in his store. Branch, Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s great-grandfather, was charged with first-degree murder, but no trial was ever held, and the crime faded from memory. Or rather, the memory of it was quietly and systematically suppressed. All that remains are a short newspaper article and a few photographs and home movies of the killer.\n\n\u201cDid You Wonder Who Fired the Gun?\u201d proceeds on several parallel tracks. Mr. Wilkerson returns to Alabama and tries to discover both how Bill Spann died and how he was forgotten. His investigation, accompanied by haunting images of Southern back roads and quiet houses, is punctuated by reminders that Bill Spann\u2019s death is hardly a unique or anomalous event. The names of Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner and other recent victims of racist violence appear onscreen, and two songs of protest loop into the soundtrack: Janelle Mon\u00e1e\u2019s \u201cHell You Talmbout\u201d and Phil Ochs\u2019s \u201cWilliam Moore.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat song, about a white postal worker and civil rights activist murdered on an Alabama highway in 1963, is the source of the film\u2019s title and a part of its wider cultural context. \u201cDid You Wonder Who Fired the Gun?\u201d is a passionately political film, aflame with rage in spite of its director\u2019s measured, ruminative tone of voice. It is also a horror movie, full of specters and silences and a terror that is pervasive, intimate and elusive.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Wilkerson, whose previous films include \u201cAn Injury to One\u201d and \u201cFar From Afghanistan,\u201d dispenses with many of the usual techniques of historical documentary. There are a few on-camera interviews, with neighbors and relatives, but more frequently Mr. Wilkerson narrates encounters that took place off camera. And his sleuthing often leads not to moments of revelation but to dead ends and deeper mysteries. The insertion of clips from \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d provides a chilling and ironic counterpoint to the grim story this movie is telling. S.E. Branch is the opposite of Gregory Peck\u2019s brave and decent Atticus Finch, and the truth about what happened to Bill Spann resists the kind of redemptive, healing conclusion that remains a cornerstone of American racial fantasy.\n\nInstead of consolation, Mr. Wilkerson offers commitment. Instead of idealism, honesty. He doesn\u2019t suppose that his film will solve anything, but there is nonetheless something profoundly useful about the way he confronts past and present manifestations of white supremacy. He links his great-grandfather\u2019s crime to the contemporaneous gang rape of Recy Taylor (the subject of an excellent recent documentary by Nancy Buirski), and uncovers patterns of abuse within his family. He corresponds with a relative who is part of a white nationalist, \u201cSouthern secessionist\u201d group. He notes the way racial injustice dwells in apparently mundane facts. The killer is immortalized in pictures and a well-kept tombstone. His victim has been almost entirely erased from memory, a kind of second death beyond the reach of redress or revenge.", "keywords": ["gun", "white", "wonder", "memory", "wilkerson", "movie", "spann", "supremacy", "review", "mr", "bill", "reckons", "fired", "racial"], "polarity": 0.04540441176470589, "subjectivity": 0.3202205882352941},

I can relate to self-loathing. The reason a person lashes out the way Dixon does is because he hates himself, so anybody can relate to that. I\u2019m drawn to complex characters; they\u2019re all filled with so many different feelings, and that\u2019s what makes them interesting. The first \u201cIron Man,\u201d Tony Stark, was an interesting character. He drinks too much, he\u2019s a womanizer, and then he has this epiphany. That\u2019s what\u2019s interesting.\n\nWhat do you think it was about this role, and this film, that led to so many awards?\n\nIt\u2019s the transformational aspect of it, the fact that he was really many different roles wrapped up in one role. He\u2019s a doofus, he\u2019s a racist, he\u2019s violent, he\u2019s a mama\u2019s boy. There\u2019s a few heroic things at certain points. But he\u2019s very flawed, and it\u2019s a boy-to-man journey.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThere\u2019s been criticism that your character got away scot-free for his racist behavior and for throwing a guy out the window, and never being brought to justice.\n\nIt\u2019s a small town and, who knows, in real life maybe he would have gotten thrown in prison. It\u2019s a sort of dark fairy tale in certain ways \u2014 it\u2019s not necessarily meant to be completely realistic. And if it is meant to be realistic, in real life, things aren\u2019t tied up in a bow. People who deserve to get punished don\u2019t necessarily get punished.\n\nDid it surprise you that there was criticism of the movie along these lines?\n\nNo, whenever a movie is popular and it is a complex dramatic story, I think it\u2019s going to stir up a lot of feelings. A lot of good stuff come out of it \u2014 the billboards that have been popping up [activists recreated versions of the billboards in Miami and London]. That\u2019s kind of incredible, when a movie can effect social change, that\u2019s kind of astounding. I think Mildred [the film\u2019s mother, played by Frances McDormand, who is seeking justice in the murder of her daughter] is a really beautiful working-class wonder woman in some ways. It\u2019s a kind of antihero slash protagonist thing that I think women really need right now. Mildred and [the directors] Greta Gerwig and Patty Jenkins.

Is it self-taught?\n\nIt\u2019s a long story, but I hung out with a certain crowd, and it was a way to meet girls.\n\nWhat kind of certain crowd?\n\nSan Francisco is not all cable cars and Rice-A-Roni. There were some tough kids there. When I was in middle school, there was a more white supremacist kind of group I didn\u2019t get along with. I got in a lot of fights with them and didn\u2019t win a lot of those fights. I didn\u2019t get along with the rich kids, people we called WPODs: white punks on dope. My school was interracial, and I met a cool group of friends who introduced me to some other friends. I used to do really bad break dancing, when \u201cThriller\u201d and \u201cPurple Rain\u201d came out. I was into Run-DMC, Grandmaster Flash, Doug E. Fresh, Eric B. & Rakim.

I\u2019ve worked with a lot of great actors. She\u2019s really a force. I think what\u2019s great about her is her integrity. Her sense of truth is like an iron bar.

While it may not be a common vantage point, the narrative is a natural one for Marilyn Stern, a photographer and graphic artist who is a member of the Metropolitan Postcard Club of New York City.\n\nNot surprisingly, the vast majority of postcards that feature black people in the United States from the 19th and 20th centuries were very racist, she said.\n\n\u201cI was so sick of seeing these horrible racist stereotypes,\u201d said Ms. Stern, a collector since the mid-1970s. \u201cWhenever I came across something that was not racist or not stereotypical, or even went so far as showing romance between the races, I wanted to save it and collect it.\u201d\n\nHer collection, which numbers about 3,000, has about 300 postcards that depict African-American life in all lights.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard for us to fathom how isolated people were, especially in rural areas and isolated small towns before there were telephones and radios,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were postal deliveries three times a day, so it was the internet of the early 1900s.\u201d\n\nPostcards had better printing technology than magazines and newspapers did at the time, as the burst of color in the selection below shows. They could show racism with clarity. \u201cThe idea that you could see images so realistic blew people away,\u201d she said.\n\nMany of the racist postcards were a form of propaganda, she said.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important to see how racism was manifested in the past,\u201d she said, \u201cperhaps to better fight it in the present. You can recognize something if you\u2019ve seen it before.\u201d\n\nBelow is a selection from Ms. Stern\u2019s collection with descriptions based on her research.\n\nTrade Cards\n\nImage\n\nAfrican-Americans were often subjects \u2014 and targets \u2014 of advertising cards that were issued before 1900. These cards were frequently given away in products, or with the purchase of a product.\n\nAbove, an advertisement for J & P Coats thread. Below, a country doctor dispensing Ayer\u2019s Cathartic Pills.\n\nImage\n\nThe Cakewalk\n\nImage\n\nThe Cakewalk, a dance created by plantation slaves as a satire of Southern white society, was the focus of these cards, which featured two black children and an African-American troupe that toured Europe in the late 1800s and early 1900s.\n\nRacist Cards\n\nImage\n\nThe card on the left was shot in a professional studio, but it was labeled \u201cHer Country Cousins.\u201d The implication was that no matter how refined, educated or successful black Americans became, they were still basically savages, Ms. Stern said.\n\nThe two cards on the right were produced in 1905 in New York on the common theme of the delivery stork. The first one, with the caption \u201cComparing Notes,\u201d shows both a black baby and a white baby, with no apparent bias. The second one shows two black babies with the slogan \u201cNo Race Suicide,\u201d implying that a high black birthrate threatened white supremacy, she said.\n\n\u201cLovers of All Nations\u201d\n\nImage\n\nThis postcard was from a series mailed in 1908 that was called \u201cLovers of All Nations.\u201d The banjo was a racial stereotype, but the card is in the non-discriminating \u201cFamily of Man\u201d tradition.\n\nMemories of Slavery\n\nImage\n\nPostcards once served as documentary photography. Some cards honored older African-Americans of the South, who were living memories of slavery. This was part of a series, and it was mailed in 1906.\n\nLife in the Jim Crow South\n\nImage\n\nA fortuneteller with white clients, mailed in 1908.\n\nHoliday Greetings\n\nImage\n\nIdealized country life, in a card mailed in 1907, as Americans flocked to cities.\n\nReligion\n\nImage\n\nA card, likely from the early 1950s, urging parishioners to come to church.\n\nReal Photos\n\nImage\n\nAn unidentified young woman in her graduation cap and gown, in a studio portrait taken between the 1920s and \u201940s. Cards labeled \u201cReal Photo Postcards\u201d are set apart from commercially printed postcards and are actual photographs printed on photographic paper with a preprinted postcard back.\n\nAchievement\n\nImage\n\nThe many important contributions that African-Americans made to society were rarely acknowledged in older postcards, but an exception was made for the scientist and educator George Washington Carver.\n\nHis experiments with peanuts, sweet potatoes and other crops contributed greatly to the economy of the South. This card \u2014 from a photo shot on Kodachrome or Ektachrome film \u2014 is from the late 1950s to mid-60s.\n\nFor more, see Ms. Stern\u2019s postcard blog, and a review of the film Through a Lens Darkly that deals with African-American representation in postcards and photography.

But those seeking to dismiss their stories of pain and demands for equality argued that the payments were proof that their accounts could not be trusted.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cYou get this idea immediately after the war, during these testimonies, that people talking about civil rights are literally getting paid\u201d to tell fabricated stories, Ms. Richardson said.\n\nThat belief spread to other contexts, too. Testimony from African-Americans on the violence perpetrated by the Ku Klux Klan, for example, was explained away as funded falsehoods.\n\n\u201cThey were attracted by a fee of two dollars per diem, and in many cases were evidently drilled for the occasion,\u201d one politician said of the testimony, according to an 1871 news report. The accounts, he said, were \u201cof the lowest kind and utterly unworthy of belief.\u201d\n\nTo Ms. Richardson, those early dismissals of African-American testimony, starting with the congressional hearings during the Reconstruction era, are not unlike the false theories spread about the Parkland school shooting suggesting that the student survivors were actors paid to protest for gun control.\n\n\u201cThat actually sounds very much like what you got in those first congressional hearings,\u201d she said.", "keywords": ["smear", "goes", "violence", "isnt", "spread", "idea", "civil", "crisis", "nonviolent", "richardson", "era", "actor", "sign", "africanamericans", "war", "testimony", "york"], "polarity": 0.07269919269919271, "subjectivity": 0.43285187785187784},

Alex Bowman, 24, who replaced Earnhardt in the No. 88 car for Hendrick Motorsports, will start the Daytona 500 from the pole position. Elliott and Blaney will be in the second row after winning the qualifying duels Thursday.\n\nOne driver in particular has the potential to do more than anyone to shake up the sport. A graduate of Nascar\u2019s Drive for Diversity program, Darrell Wallace Jr., 24, could give stock car racing something it has never had before: an African-American star.\n\nBut that is not why Richard Petty brought Wallace onto his team. Late last season, Wallace, who goes by the nickname Bubba, got four rides with Richard Petty Motorsports. It was enough for Petty, one of Nascar\u2019s most iconic names, to not only give Wallace a full-time ride, but also to give him his famed No. 43 racecar to drive. Wallace is the first African-American to drive full-time in the top Nascar series since Wendell Scott in 1971.\n\nPetty insisted, though, that he is colorblind when it comes to evaluating talent. Sure, it would be great if Wallace brings the sport into the African-American community, but as far as Petty is concerned, that\u2019s secondary.\n\n\u201cI hope he advances us as a race team,\u201d Petty said in an email. \u201cI care about what Bubba can do behind the wheel for us. The rest, there are a lot of eyes on Bubba, but he\u2019s handling it well. I know come Sunday he\u2019ll be ready to get into a racecar and just show his talent. If he does well, the rest will come and he\u2019ll grow our fan base.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThose eyes on Wallace, much as they were on Tiger Woods a generation ago, prompted Earnhardt to call him last week. The son of racing legend, Earnhardt knows all about the pressure of expectations.\n\n\u201cHe told me that the next few weeks will basically be hell with all the off-the-track stuff,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cBut he said it\u2019ll all be worth it because I have an opportunity to do things outside the sport that not many other drivers will ever say they\u2019ve had that kind of opportunity to do.

But there\u2019s also venturing out into a different market, into different avenues where the African-American culture lives. We all have to do better at that.\u201d\n\nThere are challenges, of course. On social media, where vulgar epithets can be spewed from faceless and fictitious monikers, Wallace has, at times, had to think twice before responding. He admits he has not always been successful.\n\n\u201cThere is always going to be haters out there, people who don\u2019t want to see you succeed,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been told that since Day 1 from my parents. Just keep your head down and keep moving, that\u2019s the best you can do.\u201d\n\nBlaney, his closest friend on the circuit, has been around Wallace when offensive remarks have been made.\n\n\u201cThankfully, it\u2019s very, very rare, but it upsets me,\u201d Blaney said. \u201cBubba\u2019s great at handling it. He\u2019s an amazing ambassador for the sport. And he\u2019s really talented and a heck of a competitor. All of us are competitive, but his competitiveness is unlike anyone I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\nNascar\u2019s diversity has become an issue again after its only female racer, Danica Patrick, announced she will retire from the circuit after the Daytona 500. But Wallace is not the only driver who can energize an overlooked community. What he can do for an African-American audience, Su\u00e1rez can do for the Latino market. A native of Monterrey, Mexico, Su\u00e1rez said he had noticed an uptick in social media messages from a variety of Latino countries.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s usually either people who tell me they\u2019re now following the sport because of me, or they\u2019ve been fans and now they have a driver to root for,\u201d said Su\u00e1rez, who is also a graduate of the Drive for Diversity program. \u201cThe potential is huge. This is the most diverse country in the world, but we have to improve diversity in Nascar. If we can make the sport more diverse, we\u2019ll see the same thing with fans. More diversity on the racetrack will mean more diversity in the stands.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, Nascar waits, wondering who will emerge as its next star.", "keywords": ["su\u00e1rez", "wallace", "petty", "racing", "leader", "sport", "hes", "generation", "emerge", "drive", "diversity", "africanamerican", "nascar", "waits"], "polarity": 0.13599389129389128, "subjectivity": 0.4590651755651755},

Sarah Laskow of The Atlantic explained in 2014 that philosophers at this time were, in the words of the sociologist Karl Mannheim, \u201canxious to find a general law to express the rhythm of historical development, based on the biological law of the limited lifetimes of man.\u201d /But understanding societal phenomena through the lens of groups of people born around the same time has always had its limits.\n\nFor example, it\u2019s true that for young men coming-of-age during the Vietnam War, being born in a particular year (and, thanks to the draft lottery, on a particular day) could be life-shaping. But even here, an individual\u2019s class was a factor in whether he actually went to war \u2014 men from privileged backgrounds had many options to avoid the draft, the burden of which fell mainly on the working class.\n\nLike war service, entering the labor market at a time of recession, as most millennials did, can be difficult. But race and class are more important in affecting how this experience plays out for individuals.\n\nTake white millennial college graduates: Yes, they\u2019re part of an age cohort that has experienced worse economic conditions than graduates of the preceding generation \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t give us a particularly meaningful understanding of their plight, given that they are still better off when it comes to income than the average non-college-educated worker of any age.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSome may argue that the generation game, if intellectually vacuous, is basically harmless. But dividing society by generation obscures the real and enduring lines of race, class and gender. When, for example, baby boomers are blamed for \u201cruining America,\u201d the argument lumps together Donald Trump and a 60-year-old black woman who works for minimum wage cleaning one of his hotels.\n\nThe pattern of inherited privilege points to yet another reality that the generation game ignores: the decline of social mobility between generations and the rise of what the French economist Thomas Piketty has called a \u201cpatrimonial society.\u201d When it comes to wealth and its accompanying privileges, the wealth of the previous generation of one\u2019s own family matter more than whether your birth year falls on one or other side of some arbitrary boundary.\n\nToday\u2019s young people may choose political action aimed at reversing these trends or to let them continue and accelerate.

Many Germans and Swedes now recognize \u2014 and some celebrate \u2014 the fact that their fellow citizens can have any skin color or religion. But the attempt to turn countries with monoethnic identities into truly multiethnic nations is a historically unique experiment, and so it should hardly come as a surprise that it has encountered some fierce resistance.\n\nThe situation in Canada and the United States, despite their histories as countries of immigration, has important similarities to that in Europe. Both have historically had rigid racial hierarchies. And in recent decades, both have made real steps toward overcoming these injustices: African-Americans, for example, are better represented in business and government than at any previous point in American history. This has made opposition to a more equal, multiethnic society more fervid among those who feel their privileges threatened. There is a sizable number of Americans for whom the idea of the nation remains synonymous with whiteness and Christianity.\n\nSo long as nationalism is associated with one particular ethnic or religious group, it will serve to exclude and disadvantage others. The only way to keep the destructive potential of nationalism in check is to fight for a society in which collective identity transcends ethnic and religious boundaries \u2014 one in which citizens from all religious or ethnic backgrounds are treated with the same respect as citizens from the majority group.\n\nTo effect this transformation is one of the great political challenges of our age. It requires principled resistance to right-wing nationalism, but it can succeed only if those who are most open to diversity abandon their hostility to other forms of nationalism.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

But for better or probably worse, it\u2019s easier to be moved by the suffering of people with whom we have some form of kinship. That is why nationalism remains one of the most powerful vehicles for expanding our circle of sympathy.\n\nAnother common reaction to the resurgence of nationalism has been to celebrate more narrow forms of collective identity, such as race or religion. At a time when many minority groups are under attack, it is, of course, crucial to defend them against discrimination. But it is also important to remember that such groups, too, are capable of oppressing their own members, for example by enforcing restrictive moral codes. That\u2019s why the only way to allow individuals true freedom to lead their lives is to preserve some form of political identity independent of the interests of particular cultural groups.\n\nConvinced that they would be unable to redirect nationalism toward their own ends, many of the most open-minded segments of society long ago gave up on the fight to determine its meaning. In countries like Germany and the United States, advocacy for the victims of prejudice has increasingly bled into a belief that the dark chapters of those countries\u2019 history make any form of nationalism deeply suspect. Instead of exhorting their fellow citizens to live up to their nations\u2019 highest ideals, many activists seem content with denouncing past and present injustices. This has allowed the bigots and racists to bend the meaning of the nation to their own sinister ends.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt\u2019s time to fight back. Nationalism can, and should, be reclaimed for liberals.\n\nA few political leaders have made a valiant start. Barack Obama has been an especially persuasive advocate of the idea that Americans should focus on what unites rather than what divides us and that the symbolism of the nation can inspire hope, even as we reckon with the injustices of American history. \u201cWhat greater expression of faith in the American experiment than this,\u201d Mr. Obama marveled as he stood on the spot in Selma, Ala. where civil rights protesters were beaten in 1965. \u201cWhat greater form of patriotism is there than the belief that America is not yet finished, that we are strong enough to be self-critical, that each successive generation can look upon our imperfections and decide that it is in our power to remake this nation to more closely align with our highest ideals?\u201d\n\nCampaigning for France\u2019s presidency last year, Emmanuel Macron expressed inclusive patriotism in an even more explicit form. \u201cI see Armenians, Italians, Algerians, Moroccans, Tunisians,\u201d he said at a rally in Marseille, a diverse city in southern France, \u201cBut what do I see? I see the people of Marseille! What do I see? I see the people of France!\u201d This, he added in an explicit repudiation of the exclusive nationalism propagated by the far-right National Front party, \u201cis what it means to be proud to be French!\u201d\n\nAmerican \u2014 and to a lesser degree European \u2014 political culture is pregnant with the symbols of inclusive patriotism. But while we have plenty of history to build on, we must also recognize that we are fighting to establish a kind of society for which there is no clear precedent.\n\nIn the United States, the model had once been a melting pot. But asking individuals to conform to one unified culture puts the price of admission to the nation too high. In Canada, the model is often said to be that of a salad bowl, in which the overall dish is enriched by the great variety of individual ingredients. But we can now see that this may be an overly idealized image of a society in which people feel that they have little in common across ethnic and religious divides.\n\nThere may not be a perfect culinary metaphor for the kind of country inclusive nationalists seek to create. But its contours should be obvious. It is a state in which all members have the same rights and opportunities irrespective of the group into which they are born or the culture to which they belong. It is a society in which people feel that they have something important in common because they seek to govern themselves together, pledge to help one another in an hour of need and recognize that these shared commitments are ultimately more consequential than any difference of color or creed. And it is a culture that does not shy away from celebrating the nobility of this collective identity \u2014 embracing the nation\u2019s flag not because we claim never to have failed our compatriots in the past but because we aspire to realize a common future fair to all.\n\nIt would be tempting to say that this kind of patriotism has little in common with the nationalism that is now ascendant around the world. Patriotism, some philosophers argue, should be understood as an innocent love of country that is inclusive at home and cooperative abroad. Nationalism, by contrast, excludes other ethnicities and stands in competition with the interests of other countries.\n\nBut it is too clever by half to pretend that we can safely stoke the good aspects of patriotism without ever running the danger of exacerbating the worst aspects of nationalism. For the kind of patriotism I am proposing is not a completely different form of collective identity; it is, rather, one that proudly stands in competition with the exclusionary politics on display from Washington to Moscow to Beijing.\n\nNationalism is like a half-wild beast. As long as it remains under our control, it can be of tremendous use. But if we abandon it, others are sure to step in, prodding and baiting the beast to bring out its most ferocious side. For all the well-founded misgivings about it, we have little choice but to domesticate it as best we can.", "keywords": ["reclaim", "religious", "common", "political", "liberals", "form", "identity", "society", "nation", "collective", "patriotism", "nationalism"], "polarity": 0.14129125602529854, "subjectivity": 0.47932204517310895},

The powerful message was that this black man and his white fianc\u00e9e were facing her family (and the world) and saying that was O.K. I think it was the first time I thought to myself: Love trumps color, race, culture, and even fear.\n\n\u2014 Vanessa Ricot, project manager, marketing\n\nMy mother was American and my father Colombian, and Lucy and Ricky on \u201cI love Lucy\u201d were the first ethnically mixed, semi-bilingual couple I had seen on TV. The show, which I saw reruns of as a child in the 1980s, introduced ideas like culture clash; it lightly made fun of American cluelessness about other countries, in the figures of Fred and Ethel.\n\nA comic genius, Lucy used slapstick and crocodile tears to combat her husband\u2019s machismo \u2014 and when you look at how Latina actors in her position are still forced to play stereotypes of the docile wife or the sexy spitfire, that still looks radical today.\n\n\u2014 Annie Correal, reporter, metropolitan news\n\nI am not athletic, British or Indian. But Parminder Nagra, who played Jess Bhamra in \u201cBend it Like Beckham,\u201d was close enough. She loved her traditional brown family, but she was fiercely independent and a talented soccer player. She even nabbed the hot (white) boyfriend over the Keira Knightley character. She was everything the tween in me wanted the chance to be.\n\n\u2014 Fahima Haque, editor, social media\n\nI didn\u2019t see myself in someone who looked particularly like me, but rather in someone who matched my passion for the performing arts. I fell in love with the movie \u201cSelena\u201d because of the singing and dancing.

Those were also the years when the \u201cmodel minority\u201d myth was really grating me, and I was drawn to transgressive portrayals of Asians. Jon Moritsugu\u2019s movies, in all their anarchic glory, were a revelation, especially \u201cTerminal U.S.A.,\u201d which somehow made it onto TV in the 1990s despite all its gore and drug use.\n\nLater, Justin Lin\u2019s \u201cBetter Luck Tomorrow\u201d depicted a group of Asian-American high-school students who fall into a world of crime. These are not the greatest movies ever made, but they meant a lot to me because they ignored the standard immigrant-experience formula and seemed to say: \u201cYeah, we\u2019re Asian. Now shove it.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Dave Kim, editor, national news\n\nIn my sophomore year of college, I attended a screening of \u201cSaving Face.\u201d During the Q. and A. with the director, Alice Wu, I realized it was the first time I had seen any representation of Chinese-American lesbians on screen. It\u2019s hard enough finding movies about queer women or about Asian-American women, so seeing both identities woven together in one film was incredible. Fourteen years after the movie came out, it remains alone at the center of such a Venn diagram of underrepresentation.\n\n\u2014 Kathy Zhang, analytics manager\n\nI was so excited in kindergarten to see a free-spirited, brown woman running around and calling the shots in \u201cPocahontas.\u201d I repeatedly watched the videotape, and my mother let me grow my hair down, like Pocahontas. The problem is, I\u2019m Indian-American, so Pocahontas doesn\u2019t actually represent me at all. It was just the closest character I could hold onto.

I was a black kid who played sports, and I looked up to athletes: Tito Trinidad, Ronaldo, Michael Johnson, Thierry Henry and Roy Jones Jr. These men of color were the best at what they did, and they wore their excellence and their beauty unflinchingly.

{"title": "\n                    New Y.A. Books by Women of Color Rewrite Old Cultural Scripts                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/02/books/review/ya-women-of-color-clayton-adeyemi.html", "text": "Now, more than anytime in recent history, we\u2019re hearing the triumphant roar of women of color as they break down longstanding barriers in art, film and literature. In young adult literature in particular, inventive, international stories told in newly empowered women\u2019s voices are claiming their rightful place at the table. Take these five new Y.A. books, ranging from fantasy to realistic fiction to memoir. In these authors\u2019 hands, non-Western sensibilities might reign in a vivid and original Yoruban religion-based world, or classical settings might be reinterpreted to create a universe in which beauty is not tied to race. A heartbreaking fictional front row seat to the Syrian refugee emergency is offset by a humorous true tale of growing up an Iranian-American immigrant without a green card. And a very modern romance proves that, despite divides both cultural and digital, love still wins. So do Y.A. readers, when it comes to seeing exhilaratingly new kinds of characters sharing space.\n\nIn Dhonielle Clayton\u2019s lavish fantasy THE BELLES (Freeform, $17.99; ages 14 to 17), a thing of beauty is only temporary. The decadent island society of Orl\u00e9ans is home to a select group of sisters born with the disconcerting ability to perform plastic surgery without the plastic. As \u201cdescendants of the goddess of beauty,\u201d the Belles have a fuzzily explained magical \u201carcana\u201d in their blood that allows them to temporarily change the physical appearance of the native Gris, who are cursed with gray skin and red eyes. After a childhood of training, the teenage Belles are introduced to upper-class society and tasked with transforming the hair, skin and bone structure of the race-fluid rich and royal. But when the rebellious Belle Camellia uncovers a plot by the truly vile Princess Sophia to enslave her and her sisters, she sows the seeds of a grass-roots revolution that is bound to blossom more fully in the inevitable sequel.\n\nPhoto\n\nClayton, a co-founder of the We Need Diverse Books organization, has created an opulent mash-up setting, which seems to be a cherry-picked combination of 18th-century France, Japan and the antebellum American South. If it never quite coalesces into a seamless cultural whole, readers seduced by the page-turning palace intrigue and the vivid food and clothing descriptions won\u2019t notice or care.\n\nMagic also lies dormant in the platelets of chosen teenagers in the Nigerian-American Tomi Adeyemi\u2019s debut, CHILDREN OF BLOOD AND BONE (Holt, $18.99; ages 12 and up). But these diviners are no debutantes. Born with snow white hair and deep brown skin in the imaginary country of Or\u00efsha, young diviners morph into mighty, magic-wielding maji, or magicians, at 13. For centuries they relied on their powers (which Adeyemi based on aspects of the religion of the Yoruban people of West Africa). All that ended when the nonmagical King Saran ordered the slaughter of all adult majis. But when a mysterious scroll falls into the hands of Amari, a defiant princess, and Z\u00e9lie, a tenacious diviner warrior, the two young women set out on a thrilling, death-defying journey to restore magic and take back the throne.\n\nPhoto\n\nBlack Girl Magic, indeed! It\u2019s no surprise that this epic trilogy opener has already been optioned for film. Full of cinematic action sequences (the most memorable of them set almost entirely underwater and employing an army of the dead) and creatures worthy of Star Wars (horse-size \u201clionaires\u201d have saber teeth and horns), it storms the boundaries of the imagination. Yet it also confronts the conscience. Adeyemi\u2019s brutally depicted war between the noble, lighter-skinned kosidans and the enslaved, darker-skinned majis poses thought-provoking questions about race, class and authority that hold up a warning mirror to our sharply divided society.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Tareq is a Syrian refugee whose perilous journey is narrated by the voice of Destiny, characterized as a kindly, prosaic entity. After Tareq\u2019s mother, grandmother and four of his siblings are killed by a bomb, he and his father flee to Turkey with his remaining sister, Susan. They hopscotch from Turkey to Greece, Serbia, Slovenia, Austria and finally to Germany, where he finds a fragile safety. Along the way he witnesses beheadings and drownings, but also experiences the kindness of aid workers like Alexia, an American student. Abawi, a foreign news correspondent, does an admirable job of showing the grim horror of refugee life. But her efforts are occasionally undermined by cartoonish villains (\u201cYou tink you will be saved? Who will save you? Captain America is not real, just movies\u201d) and by some of Destiny\u2019s well-meaning but obvious platitudes: \u201cWhen you truly love someone, their life means more to you than your own.\u201d These interruptions may pull readers out of the story, though perhaps that distance is necessary for adolescents trying to process something as bleak and overwhelming as the Syrian refugee crisis.\n\nPhoto\n\nOf course, once refugees finally arrive in their adopted country, new problems arise. Until she was 13, Sara Saedi, an Iranian-American television writer and the author of the memoir AMERICANIZED: Rebel Without a Green Card (Random House, $17.99, ages 12 and up), was cheerfully oblivious of her family\u2019s immigration status. After her older sister breaks the news that they are \u201cillegal,\u201d Saedi suffers through the usual teenage rites of passage at her Silicon Valley high school (unibrow management, pimple wars, pot smoking) with the added pressure of possible deportation hanging over her head. Saedi adroitly and humorously uses these universal pubescent ordeals to contextualize Iranian culture and the immigrant experience. A memory of being teased about her eyebrow in ninth grade expands into a discussion of beauty norms: When her mother praises her for being hairless, \u201cshe meant by Persian woman standards. I was still hairy by everyone else\u2019s standards.\u201d And she has the sobering realization that pot is a privilege American teenagers can enjoy, but not undocumented kids: \u201cIf I got caught, I\u2019d have a criminal record that could be grounds for deportation.\u201d Very funny but never flippant, Saedi mixes \u201990s pop culture references, adolescent angst and Iranian history into an intimate, informative narrative that thoroughly defies current divisive views on immigration.\n\nPhoto\n\nMary H.K. Choi\u2019s blushingly tender and piquant debut novel, EMERGENCY CONTACT (Simon & Schuster, $17.99; ages 14 and up), about two isolated, misfit college students from Austin who fall in love via text message explores our emotional rather than geographical divides. In \u201cEmergency Contact,\u201d a Korean-American would-be writer named Penny keeps everyone at a distance, the result of living with a single, oversharing mom she calls \u201cthe equivalent of \u2026 human glitter.\u201d But when she rescues Sam, a half-German, half-Polish student filmmaker, from the sidewalk during a panic attack, she becomes his \u201cemergency contact,\u201d and he hers. Their charged, initial banter on text soon develops into increasingly personal exchanges about art, death, unstable moms and pregnant ex-girlfriends. Yet their burgeoning bond keeps stalling out. Burned by past relationships and millennial-ly tethered to their devices, they struggle to connect romantically IRL. Sam \u201ccouldn\u2019t imagine the space Penny would take up in his life if she sprang out of his phone,\u201d and Penny admits \u201cSam was her phone and her phone was Sam.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nChoi, a culture correspondent for HBO\u2019s Vice News, inserts timely issues like sexual assault, cultural appropriation and even DACA into her characters\u2019 intimate conversations, but it is her examination of digital vs. F2F communication that feels the most immediate. Has digital communication become so ubiquitous, and interpersonal contact so arduous, that we\u2019d rather type than talk? Thankfully, no.

She takes comfort from local efforts like a project in Utica, N.Y., where Bosnian Muslim immigrants and local Unitarian Christians watched a Super Bowl together. She applauds aggressive racial integration programs like those run by the American military. She cites her own teaching experience in small seminars at Yale, where students from divergent backgrounds overcame disagreements to achieve mutual respect, sometimes even friendship.\n\nPhoto\n\nYet the scholar in Chua acknowledges that these individual experiences offer less of a social lesson than she would wish.\n\n\u201cStudies show that minimal or superficial exposure to out-group members can actually worsen group division. \u2026 Negative interactions with people from other groups also increase group hostility. So merely putting members of different groups in the same space is not enough and indeed can aggravate political tribalism.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Chua falls back on the very attitude to which she turned her sharply skeptical gaze at the beginning of the book: the conviction that the United States was, is and will remain an exceptional nation, different from all the others. In her introduction, Chua remarked that the United States as a supertribal entity indifferent to ethnicity and culture became at best a partial reality only a generation ago. By book\u2019s end, however, the battered ideal has been polished and refurbished.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Will we, telling ourselves \u2018These immigrants are different,\u2019 be the weak link, the first generation to fail? Will we forget who we are?\u201d That\u2019s inspiring, and even more so are the citations of Martin Luther King Jr., Lin-Manuel Miranda and Langston Hughes that finish the book.\n\nInspiring \u2014 but not wholly reassuring. A lot of the interest of \u201cPolitical Tribes\u201d comes from the strong sense it emanates of an author arguing with herself. Chua both condemns tribalism and respects its power. She insists that the United States alone of nations among the earth has often transcended it \u2014 and then presents impressive contrary evidence from the past and the present. Chua reckons with the many tribalisms of the American past: ethnic, religious and racial. She hopes for a future in which tribalism fades \u2014 even as she mercilessly details its accumulating strength.\n\nAs Chua notes, tribes can coalesce out of previously unrelated pieces. Immigrants to Europe from North Africa, the Middle East and South Asia \u2014 of different languages, ethnicities, folkways and religious practices \u2014 raised children who created for themselves a new identity as post-ethnic Muslims. ISIS, as Chua mordantly observes, is in its own way a melting pot, bringing together young men and women from across Europe, Asia and the Americas to fight for a new ideology. She quotes a New York Times article about young British girls lured to ISIS. For them, \u201cIslam is punk rock.\u201d\n\nTribes can be created by fission as well as by fusion. Chua suggests that in the United States, divisions that would once have been understood as class divides have been reinterpreted in our time as cultural, even when they are not ethnic. \u201cWhite Americans often hold their biggest disdain for other white Americans \u2014 the ones on the opposite side of the cultural divide.\u201d\n\nThese fast-evolving and ever-changing identities may look contingent from the outside. They feel overwhelmingly powerful to those inside. Chua repeatedly scolds American policymakers for underestimating the importance of ethnocultural identity in Vietnam in the 1960s, Venezuela in the 1990s and Afghanistan in the 2000s. Through her book pulses an evident worry that tribal claims are now overpowering national ones within the United States. If she cannot quite bring herself to make her own anxieties explicit \u2014 or figure out what if anything to do to address them \u2014 she is hardly alone.

Fred Harris is the second person to the right of Kerner. Underwood Archives/Getty Images\n\n\u201cOur nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one white \u2013 separate and unequal.\u201d\n\nFifty years ago, on March 1, 1968, these were the grim words of the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, called the Kerner Commission after its chairman, Gov. Otto Kerner of Illinois.\n\nPresident Lyndon Johnson had established the commission to examine the disorders and violent protests in Detroit, Newark and well over 100 other American cities during the summer of 1967, and earlier. What it found was searing. \u201cWhat white Americans have never fully understood \u2013 but what the Negro can never forget \u2013 is that white society is deeply implicated in the ghetto,\u201d the commission concluded. \u201cWhite institutions created it, white institutions maintain it, and white society condones it.\u201d\n\nMostly moderate and mostly white men, the members of the bipartisan panel carried the imprimatur of the political establishment. Their recommendations attracted widespread public debate. The paperback edition of the report sold over two million copies.\n\nOccupied by the Vietnam War and concerned about the legacy of his Great Society domestic agenda, Johnson distanced himself from the \u201ctwo societies\u201d warning. But the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Senator Robert Kennedy strongly endorsed the commission\u2019s findings and recommendations before they were assassinated and before more protests erupted during that traumatic year of 1968.\n\nThe Kerner Commission recommended \u201cmassive and sustained\u201d investments in jobs and education to reduce poverty, inequality and racial injustice.

The overall poverty rate remains about the same today as it was 50 years ago; the total number of poor people has increased from over 25 million to well over 40 million, more than the population of California.\n\nMeanwhile, the rich have profited at the expense of most working Americans. Today, the top 1 percent receive 52 percent of all new income. Rich people are healthier and live longer. They get a better education, which produces greater gains in income. And their greater economic power translates into greater political power.\n\nFive Indicators America of the 1960s contrasted with the most recent available data.

I\u2019d love to jump right in and hear your aspirations for Prairie View. What do you hope to accomplish in your time as president? I assume you had many offers to lead other colleges. Why was Prairie View different?\n\nRuth Simmons: Well, I\u2019m a native of Texas, and one of the things that I did when I returned to Houston after I retired from Brown was think about the ways I could use my experience to help the community. I started with small ventures in the city, but I hadn\u2019t thought really that another university would be in my life. But when I was approached by Prairie View, I thought immediately about its significant impact on my brother, who went there. And what Dillard did for me.\n\nI grew up in a segregated neighborhood in Grapeland, Tex., with very little experience with the world. The transition that Dillard enabled for me was extremely valuable. As an undergraduate, I began to grow a sense of confidence that helped me move from a fairly insular environment to a bigger stage when I went to graduate school.\n\nMy aspirations for Prairie View are to essentially make sure the university is continuing to do the same thing for students today that it did for my brother \u2014 and Dillard did for me. And that is to offer the advantage of a strong education that will prepare students for the careers they want, in a social and cultural context that helps them develop the confidence to perform after graduation.\n\nAs president, that means focusing on time-honored strategies to success that apply to universities everywhere: worrying about the faculty who are recruited here, the campus experience, and whether we are providing the leadership and internship opportunities that students need. It means worrying about the reputation of the university. It\u2019s obviously a much more competitive world today than it was when I was a student, but the underlying work to move the university to a level of achievement that makes students and alumni proud is the same.\n\nM.J.: What do you see as some of the major challenges facing historically black colleges and universities?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nR.S.: The general challenge for H.B.C.U.s is not unlike the problem many universities face today, and that is the financial model. Being tuition dependent has become a large problem for all universities. H.B.C.U.s are dependent on raising money, but that is a reality that most universities obviously face. So it very much depends on the question of whether the schools have a good-enough foundation because of secure financing. When it comes to the federal government\u2019s role in supporting H.B.C.U.s, I think we don\u2019t yet understand the extent to which they will be affected by the changes in Washington today. To say that many are not hopeful in this moment is an understatement. We just don\u2019t know.\n\nFrankly, that\u2019s why I advocate for developing enough financial independence to secure the future of our institutions. That means looking for different revenue streams, looking to increase our ability to raise funds and finding alternate programs that help to bring more income into our university. The only strategy cannot be to persistently raise tuition, making college outside the reach of many families.\n\nM.J.: You\u2019ve led several institutions that are all very different from each other, and the topic of leadership is something you\u2019ve talked a lot about. In another interview with The Times you said that it\u2019s much easier to lead people \u201cif you convey the underlying principles.\u201d Can you elaborate?\n\nR.S.: One thing that I\u2019ve learned is that the perceptions of what it takes to be a leader are often based on prototypical models that don\u2019t have much truth in reality. People look at the institutions that I have led and they see dissimilarities. I see similarities. When people think in terms of leadership, they\u2019re often thinking about the kind of specific skills needed for different types of enterprises. I think of leadership as more of a disposition \u2014 the ability to step into a situation to learn about the history of the enterprise, the opportunities that it faces, the culture that exists and the people who are served by it. To look at all of that, to listen to stakeholders and then to think about how that enterprise or institution should best be served. There is no one model of leadership if you approach it that way. What I have tried to do wherever I go is to start where the institution is rather than try to import particularly rigid constructs from other places. In that sense, I think a leader is more than anything else a facilitator. A person who is able to come in to show a community a picture of what it is, to provide some insight into what it could be \u2014 how it could be different or improved perhaps \u2014 and then enlist the help of people who are there and others who support that institution in order to move forward together.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nI don\u2019t subscribe to the model of hero leadership, which is identifying somebody who can come in and have magical powers and then wield the wand and fix things that have not been fixable before. I don\u2019t see that. I think leadership is a community affair.\n\nM.J.: That makes sense. So how do you approach educating the current generation of students at Prairie View to lead in the way you described?\n\nR.S.: People today are fond of leadership programs that theorize about the profile and tenets of leadership. And students anxiously get involved in those programs. I rather think that our entire campuses are incubators of leadership even without the formality of such programs because if we\u2019re doing what we should be doing, we are acclimating students to an environment in which they have to learn to work with others who are very different from themselves. And that seems to me to be the first requirement of leadership. To actually learn to work with people in a respectful and inclusive way is inordinately important. A campus provides one of the best opportunities for people to be able to do that because you sit in class alongside people whom you initially don\u2019t know. You are discussing your ideas, having people respond to them and often rejecting what you\u2019re saying. You are joining organizations that have certain aims that are being advanced by the collective, so you\u2019re learning how to facilitate. You are asked to step into leadership roles either through student government or organizations. Even in the classroom context you might play a leadership role. You have to learn to express yourself, to be convincing, to write out your ideas, to be more thoughtful than you\u2019d ordinarily be. All of those things are components of leadership.\n\nM.J.: Some would argue that social media, or perhaps disagreements over the concept of safe spaces, have made it more challenging for people to come together and to work together.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nR.S.: Yeah, I would say that people frequently say that, but that has certainly not been my experience. I would say that in my days as a student, the tensions were higher, the disagreements were greater, the separation among us was certainly more pronounced. And people are kind of inventing a new narrative, that things are so much worse today than they were in the past. I don\u2019t buy that. I think we have new terminology, because the modern sciences of psychology and sociology and so forth and modern media have enabled us to peer into areas that we were not able to see as easily as before. And so when you have social media and all of the ways in which people can now say whatever they want to say \u2014 in an unartful or offensive way \u2014 that turns the volume up to be sure. But it doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t there before.\n\nI would say that the current situation ought to give us much more practice in how to engage with each other because it is not underground. It\u2019s out front, it\u2019s in the open. The media today and the things that are being reported should be upsetting or troubling to students, my goodness. But it may be an even better opportunity to engage students.\n\nAs a teacher, as an educator, I would say these times are especially fertile for teaching the skills that are needed in a world in which there are many types of people, many perspectives and so forth. Students don\u2019t need to feel silenced by the current situation. When students at Brown came to me and said, you know, they were hurt because somebody asked them about their hair, and they were tired of that and they didn\u2019t want any part of it, I would say, \u201cWell, that\u2019s just too bad!\u201d Somebody asked you about your hair, tell them about your hair. You are in college not to hide from that. You\u2019re there to teach the world about yourself, you\u2019re there to learn about others and to teach them about who you are. So I\u2019d rather think this whole notion of protecting people from that is something that we have to take in hand and deal with. And help students see the opportunity in that because if they engage with people who have those kinds of perspectives, they are going to be much stronger in the end than if they run away.\n\nM.J.: Do you see the situation differently for students at H.B.C.U.s? You mentioned that Dillard gave you the space to learn and build confidence before heading to graduate school.\n\nR.S.: There is a narrative that many people have for H.B.C.U.s. People see them as a monolith, or only see them as filling a gap that exists for African-Americans. H.B.C.U.s are not a brand. They are institutions with a certain history \u2014 they were originally set up basically to insure that there would be two separate systems for education \u2014 but they are not all alike, and are very diverse in what they offer.\n\nPrairie View, for example, is the second-oldest public institution of higher education in the state of Texas. It was set up basically to insure that there would be two separate systems for ex-slaves and whites. For a long time it provided educational opportunities for black students that wouldn\u2019t have been open to them otherwise. In nursing, architecture, engineering and other STEM fields at a time when many blacks were not able to go into those areas, the university was able to facilitate the entry of blacks into those professions.\n\nM.J.: Yes, this is something that Nikole Hannah-Jones has written about for The New York Times Magazine, in particular how Xavier University of Louisiana sends more black students to medical school than almost any other college in the country. I read that Prairie View has many more students who graduate with degrees in architecture and engineering.\n\nR.S.: Yes, going to Dillard is not like going to Prairie View. So the student who chooses to go to one H.B.C.U. may not find another appealing. That has to do with the unique features of the place, the academic culture and so on, the traditions. All of that makes a big difference.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen I went off to college, I was just trying to find a place where I could be a student without impediments that in that day and time were fairly widely known to be substantial if you enrolled in a majority-white institution. There was no question that in 1963, if you went off to college in the South, you had to be very careful about where you studied. The racial dynamic was very challenging at that time. One of the things I\u2019m learning now is that many of the students I speak to at Prairie View today have the same kinds of thoughts that I had those many years ago. They ask themselves, where can I feel comfortable so that I don\u2019t have to worry about anything but my academic work? So certainly that plays a factor in why students apply to H.B.C.U.s. And for some H.B.C.U.s, applications are way up. But if you reach the point where you think that a category of institutions are the right choice for you \u2014 going to an H.B.C.U. just to go to an H.B.C.U. \u2014 then you\u2019re not thinking broadly enough.\n\nM.J.: As you look across the landscape of higher education, what other challenges do college students face today?\n\nR.S.: I guess I worry a lot about our students having the skills and the experience to promote respectful interactions with a wide-ranging group of people. Students can be quite passionate about what they see on the national scene and how sometimes dangerous they think it is \u2014 how unpleasant it is and so forth. But we\u2019ve got to try to find a way on our campuses not to taint the national picture as hopeless, or as being antithetical to anything that we can think of as good and admirable. The last thing we want is for our students to bow out and decide that it isn\u2019t worth trying to do anything about a hopeless situation.\n\nAnd I do think that civility goes hand in hand with being hopeful. Hopeful that the next person you meet you will be able to converse with you in a respectful way. Hopeful that the next election cycle is going to give you a chance to be engaged and able to do something that makes you feel a sense of your own agency. Hopeful that the things will get better rather than worse.\n\nSo much of what we have to do on our campuses is really to hold open the possibility for people that civil society will in the end right itself \u2014 if enough of us are engaged. I am so thankful every day for the fact that I grew up in a time when nobody thought blacks would be able to be integrated into American society, they would never be able to hold important positions, they\u2019d never be respected intellectually, they\u2019d never be able to do the things that they are now able to do. So why did we persist? And why did we continue to work toward betterment? We did it because we had people working with us in education who were ever hopeful that things were going to change. So I like to say to educators, you have to be always projecting to students that civility enables hopefulness to be ever resurgent.", "keywords": ["leadership", "think", "able", "simmons", "generation", "students", "ruth", "cultivating", "view", "college", "things", "dont", "say", "prairie", "today"], "polarity": 0.18839701321015756, "subjectivity": 0.47766767453623127},

They are quiet, almost too much so. But once you learn what happened in these scenes from small towns, big cities or verdant fields, their almost unemotional first impression gives way to horror: Someone was lynched there.\n\nStarting in 2016, Mr. Clasper traveled through the United States seeking the sites of lynchings. He wanted to show how places that call no attention to themselves were the sites of hangings, slashings or execution by gunfire. In the course of covering 24 sites, they span 150 years, right up to the present century, and range from the American south to New York City.\n\n\u201cFrom my perspective, I take it back to 1903, when the American scholar and activist W.E.B. Du Bois said the problem of the 20th century is the problem of the color line,\u201d Mr. Clasper said. \u201cIt seems to me not a lot has changed despite significant advances. There has been barely a year or generation that has passed where racism and violence have not been at the forefront of the American experience.\u201d\n\nAs the London-born son of a British mother and American father, Mr. Clasper said he had \u201ca deep spiritual connection to the American landscape.\u201d In this series \u2014 titled \u201cThe Spaces We Inherit\u201d \u2014 he hopes to gently confront viewers in a way that eschews graphic images of violence.\n\n\u201cI took a different approach and focused on the spaces to encourage people to look at this history from an altered perspective,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve become desensitized to images of violence. But everything that happen s has to happen somewhere.\u201d\n\nGiven the persisting tensions over racial and religious prejudice, Mr. Clasper wants to gently provoke a necessary conversation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to investigate these deep-seated issues in America,\u201d he said. \u201cI think many agree that the nation has not dealt with its bloody past of lynchings and segregation. It seemed to me there has been no collective acceptance, let alone recognition of the mistakes made and the sins committed.\u201d\n\nInterviews were conducted by Oliver Clasper and have been edited for brevity.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Jesse Lee Bond, Arlington, Tenn., 1939\n\nOn April 28, 1939, a local sharecropper named Jesse Lee Bond was shot to death in broad daylight by employees of SY Wilson, a local hardware store. Jesse Lee Bond had asked for an invoice the day before after purchasing goods on credit, something that was no\u0095t done by African-Americans at that time as keeping sharecroppers in the dark about how much they had spent was one way for white owners to keep their workers in constant debt. The day of Jesse Lee Bond\u2019s murder he was ordered back to the store. His aunt accompanied him and witnessed the whole thing. \u201cThey shot at him and shot him. He ran out to the outhouse. They riddled the outhouse. And when he staggered out of the outhouse, they threw him down, castrated him, and dragged him to the river,\u0095\u201d she said. The family was told he had drowned accidentally.\n\nImage\n\nSylvester Lewis, Memphis\n\n\u201cI remember my cousin Jesse well. I was 9 when he was killed and he was 20. What I heard was that there had been a dispute at the SY Wilson general store over in Arlington. Jesse insisted on a receipt, but this is something they didn\u2019\u0095t do. I think whoever he was negotiating with relented, but I think the people over him, the father of the individual in question, didn\u2019\u0095t like it. They went to his home and said they wanted to talk to him and ordered him back to the store. When he returned they attacked him. He tried to run for his life but they caught up with him and shot him. I also heard that they dragged his body behind a vehicle and then dumped him in the river. The descendants are running the store now, and I\u2019\u0095m not sure they know what happened. The ones who were allegedly involved in the lynching passed a long time ago, but their relations are still in Arlington. I don\u2019t think there\u2019\u0095s any resentment now. Anyone who hears about it can\u2019\u0095t understand how that could happen. They simply can\u2019t relate to that kind of criminal activity.\u201d\n\nInterviewed November 2016.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Emmett Till, Drew, Miss., 1955.\n\nIn what is one of the most significant race-related events in the history of the United States, Emmett Till, a 14-year-old Chicago native, was brutally lynched in rural Mississippi on Aug. 28, 1955. Till, who had been visiting family members in the area, entered a local white-owned grocery store in the town of Money for less than one minute. Whatever was said between him and the proprietor, Carolyn Bryant, was used as the pretext for his murder. Four days later Till was abducted from his uncle\u2019\u0095s house by Roy Bryant, Carolyn\u2019\u0095s husband, and J.W. Milam and driven to a nearby barn where he was severely beaten and tortured (the original wall of the barn can be seen on the left of the photograph). He was then taken to the Tallahatchie River, shot in the head, and drowned with a cotton gin fan tied around his neck. In an infamous court case both defendants were found \u0094not guilty\u0095 by an all-white jury. Months later they sold their story and admitted their guilt, with Bryant claiming that the Supreme Court decision Brown v. Board of Education that desegregated schools was a mistake. Emmett Till\u2019s mother, Mamie Till Bradley, allowed photos to be taken of her son\u2019s broken and swollen body because she \u201cwanted the world to see what they did to my baby.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nDr. Jeffrey Andrews, Drew, Miss.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know the history of the property when I purchased it in 2003 and it was only two years later that a few local people told me of the Emmett Till murder. I\u2019ve lived in Drew since I was 12 and I had never heard of it. I\u2019ve since modified the barn to make it more functional and useful, and someone once asked me why I would change a historical site, but history is in the past and people should move on. Things have changed drastically here in the Mississippi Delta region and race relations are at all-time high. History is an important learning tool and it should be used to help people move forward, but one thing you have to remember is that people here don\u2019t want to be constantly reminded of how things were 60 years ago. We\u2019ve all moved forward, and sometimes people aren\u2019t given enough credit for the changes we\u2019ve made. I respect everyone\u2019s feelings towards Emmett Till, and I\u2019ve met some of his family members. They\u2019re great people. This has been a learning experience for my family and we appreciate the fact that we\u2019re part of a historical site.\u201d\n\nInterviewed March 2017.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Joe Coe, Omaha, 1891\n\nOn Oct. 10, 1891, a 50-year-old African-American named Joe Coe (also known as George Smith) was accused of sexually assaulting a 5-year-old girl and was quickly arrested. Rumors spread that the girl had died and that Coe would get off lightly, neither of which was true. A frenzied mob seized him from the jail at the Douglas County Courthouse, put a rope around his neck, and dragged his body through the streets. Coe was then hanged from a streetcar wire on the corner of 17th and Harney in front of thousands of onlookers. Souvenirs of the rope were later sold. Mayor Richard C. Cushing of Omaha condemned the lynching as \u201c\u0094the most deplorable thing that has ever happened in the history of the country.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Ell Persons, Memphis, 1917\n\nWhen the decapitated body of a 16-year-old local, Antoinette Rappel, was found near the old Wolf River Bridge in May 1917, Ell Persons, a local black woodcutter, was deemed a possible suspect. Despite being arrested and released twice, he was captured a third time and forced to confess. A local mob announced that he was to be lynched the next day. The news spread, and a crowd of 3,000 turned up to witness his lynching (including students of Central High School). Ell Persons was burned on a makeshift pyre in a carnival-like atmosphere. He was then decapitated, and his head was taken to the predominantly African-American Beale Street and thrown at locals. A century later his lynching was commemorated and a historic marker was erected near the site.\n\nImage\n\nAmal Altareb, Memphis\n\n\u201cI came to America in 2012 from Yemen. I\u2019m still learning the language and the history, and it wasn\u2019t until the spring of last year that I learned about lynchings. I knew some of the history of segregation and Jim Crow laws, and I knew how unfair the system was \u2014 that African-Americans weren\u2019t treated as equals \u2014 but I didn\u2019t know that human beings had been burned or hanged from a tree just because of their race. Last year my class at Central High School were discussing it and I asked what lynchings were and they were surprised that I didn\u2019t know. It\u2019s surprising that humans can go so far as to kill someone else in this way and create a festival-like atmosphere. There were even spectators. Uncovering the truth is painful, but it\u2019s important. The African-American students especially don\u2019t talk about it because it\u2019s painful, and it reminds them of the injustices towards their race. White Americans don\u2019t want to remember either because of the guilt they feel. I can understand why people want to avoid the topic, but we need to face history in order to move forward.\u201d\n\nInterviewed October 2016.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Leo Frank, Marietta, Ga., 1915\n\nMary Phagan, 13, was found dead on April 26, 1913, at a National Pencil Company factory where she worked. Amid an atmosphere of anti-Semitism and despite conflicting evidence, a Jewish superintendent named Leo Frank was convicted of the crime. Frank\u2019s sentence was later commuted from the death penalty to life imprisonment, a decision that led a mob on Aug. 17, 1915, to seize him from state prison and lynch him from a tree in Marietta, Mary Phagan\u2019s hometown. Later that year the second chapter of the Ku Klux Klan was founded on Stone Mountain, with a number of Leo Frank\u2019s murderers present. Leo Frank was posthumously pardoned in 1986.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of George W. Murray, Mae Murray Dorsey, Roger Malcom and Dorothy Malcolm, Walton County, Georgia, 1946\n\nAfter Roger Malcom, a World War II veteran and Georgia sharecropper, had been bailed out of jail after allegedly stabbing a white man, members of the local community decided to take revenge. On July 25, 1946, a mob of 15 to 20 stopped the car Malcom was riding in with his wife, Dorothy, and another couple, George W. Murray and Mae Murray Dorsey, who was pregnant. They tied the four of them to a nearby tree and shot them to death. Mae Murray Dorsey then had her unborn baby ripped out of her. Despite an F.B.I. investigation nobody was brought to trial for the crime, and a few months later a grand jury was \u201cunable to establish the identity of any persons guilty of violating the civil rights statute of the United States.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nCeleste Butler, Omaha\n\n\u201cTracing one\u2019s roots and one\u2019s history is hard, especially as an African-American. These are big questions we all want to know: Who are we and where do we come from? I had DNA testing done recently but it didn\u2019t lead anywhere. It just told me that my ancestors came from West Africa, but it couldn\u2019t say where exactly. Missing that part and not being able to hand it down to my children or grandchildren is frustrating. On top of that you hear some people in this country telling black people to \u2018go back home.\u2019 Home to what? Home to whom? It feels like a total assault both mentally and physically to have chapters and generations missing. Not being able to fill that void is difficult. When it comes to racial violence I feel like we\u2019re constantly suffering from PTSD. It\u2019s a stress that never really goes away. A lot of people suffer in pain and in silence, and they suffer for successive generations. Everything was stripped from us, and we\u2019ve been struggling to put the pieces back together ever since.\u201d\n\nInterviewed September 2017.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Michael Donald, Mobile, Ala., 1981\n\nMichael Donald, 19, was abducted on March 21, 1981, by Henry Hays and James Knowles as he was walking home. They beat him, slit his throat, and hanged his body from a tree outside 114 Herndon Avenue. The pretext for Donald\u2019s murder was a \u201cnot guilty\u201d verdict handed down by a partially black jury to an African-American man accused of killing a white police officer. This incensed the Alabama chapter of the Ku Klux Klan, led by Benny Jack Hays, the father of Henry Hays, who suggested killing a random black person in response. Michael Donald\u2019s mother, Beulah Mae Donald, with the help of the Southern Poverty Law Center, brought a case not just against the killers but also the United Klans of America. Beulah Mae Donald won the case and received $7 million in damages, essentially bankrupting the U.K.A. Henry Hays was executed, while Knowles received life imprisonment. Hays is the only known Klan member to have been executed in the 20th century for the murder of an African-American. Herndon Avenue has since been renamed Michael Donald Avenue and a historic marker has been erected.\n\nImage\n\nThe Lynching Site of Mulugeta Seraw, Portland, Ore., 1988\n\nOn the evening of Nov. 13, 1988, an Ethiopian student named Mulugeta Seraw was being dropped off at his apartment when he was attacked by Kenneth Mieske, Kyle Brewster and Steve Strasser, members of a local racist skinhead group called East Side White Pride. Mieske delivered the fatal blows with a baseball bat. He was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. In 1990 Seraw\u2019s family, represented by the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League, brought a civil lawsuit against the killers\u2019 affiliated group, the White Aryan Nation, and its leaders, Tom and John Metzger, for $12.5 million. Tom Metzger later said that the killers had done their \u201ccivic duty\u201d by killing Seraw.\n\nImage\n\nJason Downard, Portland, Ore.\n\n\u201cWhen I was 2 I was put into foster care, and in 2009 I went to prison for a gang-affiliated drive-by shooting. I didn\u2019t grow up racist, but in prison the racist skinheads pulled me into their group and drilled stuff into my head about how the media is run by Jews and that they wanted an all-white nation. I also got a tattoo of a swastika on my leg, which I\u2019ve since had covered up. It\u2019s a painful reminder. The skinheads showed me support and love and compassion, which I hadn\u2019t experienced before in my life; everyone is looking for some kind of acceptance. I was angry and uncomfortable with who I was, and I drove that anger towards people who didn\u2019t look like me. In the last two years of the movement my sister had a son with a black guy and my nephew would give me this look like he knew what I was about. I started to get a guilty conscience and began to think about the things I thought I believed in. My sister said I\u2019d been brainwashed, and I can see why. The movement just taught me to hate and reinforced those views. The problem of racism in this country is much deeper than many people think. When it comes to Trump, he\u2019s tacitly endorsed the alt-right and white supremacists. It\u2019s been a ripple effect and things have gotten worse since he came into power. The right now feel emboldened. I look back now at some of the things I\u2019ve done and I realize that I\u2019ve hurt a lot of people. I decided I wanted to help others who had been in a similar position to me, and that\u2019s been my mission ever since. Now I work for an organization called Life After Hate. I\u2019m a marked man, and maybe I\u2019ll die doing this, but at least I\u2019ll die knowing I did the right thing.\u201d\n\nInterviewed October 2017.\n\nImage\n\nThe Murder Site of Timothy Caughman, New York City, 2017\n\nOn March 17, 2017 James Harris Jackson traveled from his home in Baltimore to New York City with the intention of killing random black men. The reason, he later told police, was his hatred of interracial relationships. Three days later he found Timothy Caughman, 66, collecting cans in a trash bin on the corner of West 36th and 9th Avenue and stabbed him multiple times with an 18-inch sword. Caughman died of his injuries that night, and two days later Jackson turned himself in, telling police that he had planned to kill more black men in Times Square. On March 27, Jackson was charged with one count each of murder in the first and second degrees as an act of terrorism, second-degree murder as a hate crime, and three counts of criminal possession of a weapon.\n\n\u201cThe Spaces We Inherit,\u201d which will be published as a book by Overlapse in October 2018, is available for pre-order.\n\nFollow @nytimesphoto on Twitter.

Though his inquiry is intensely, at times painfully personal, Mr. Wilkerson is above all concerned with unpacking the mechanisms of racial domination. The procedure is akin to performing surgery on a half-conscious subject, or digging up a buried land mine that has lost little of its explosive power.\n\nVideo\n\nThe focus of his excavation is a killing that took place in Dothan, Ala., in 1946, when S.E. Branch, a white shopkeeper, shot Bill Spann, a black man who was in his store. Branch, Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s great-grandfather, was charged with first-degree murder, but no trial was ever held, and the crime faded from memory. Or rather, the memory of it was quietly and systematically suppressed. All that remains are a short newspaper article and a few photographs and home movies of the killer.\n\n\u201cDid You Wonder Who Fired the Gun?\u201d proceeds on several parallel tracks. Mr. Wilkerson returns to Alabama and tries to discover both how Bill Spann died and how he was forgotten. His investigation, accompanied by haunting images of Southern back roads and quiet houses, is punctuated by reminders that Bill Spann\u2019s death is hardly a unique or anomalous event. The names of Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner and other recent victims of racist violence appear onscreen, and two songs of protest loop into the soundtrack: Janelle Mon\u00e1e\u2019s \u201cHell You Talmbout\u201d and Phil Ochs\u2019s \u201cWilliam Moore.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat song, about a white postal worker and civil rights activist murdered on an Alabama highway in 1963, is the source of the film\u2019s title and a part of its wider cultural context. \u201cDid You Wonder Who Fired the Gun?\u201d is a passionately political film, aflame with rage in spite of its director\u2019s measured, ruminative tone of voice. It is also a horror movie, full of specters and silences and a terror that is pervasive, intimate and elusive.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Wilkerson, whose previous films include \u201cAn Injury to One\u201d and \u201cFar From Afghanistan,\u201d dispenses with many of the usual techniques of historical documentary. There are a few on-camera interviews, with neighbors and relatives, but more frequently Mr. Wilkerson narrates encounters that took place off camera. And his sleuthing often leads not to moments of revelation but to dead ends and deeper mysteries. The insertion of clips from \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d provides a chilling and ironic counterpoint to the grim story this movie is telling. S.E. Branch is the opposite of Gregory Peck\u2019s brave and decent Atticus Finch, and the truth about what happened to Bill Spann resists the kind of redemptive, healing conclusion that remains a cornerstone of American racial fantasy.\n\nInstead of consolation, Mr. Wilkerson offers commitment. Instead of idealism, honesty. He doesn\u2019t suppose that his film will solve anything, but there is nonetheless something profoundly useful about the way he confronts past and present manifestations of white supremacy. He links his great-grandfather\u2019s crime to the contemporaneous gang rape of Recy Taylor (the subject of an excellent recent documentary by Nancy Buirski), and uncovers patterns of abuse within his family. He corresponds with a relative who is part of a white nationalist, \u201cSouthern secessionist\u201d group. He notes the way racial injustice dwells in apparently mundane facts. The killer is immortalized in pictures and a well-kept tombstone. His victim has been almost entirely erased from memory, a kind of second death beyond the reach of redress or revenge.", "keywords": ["gun", "white", "wonder", "memory", "wilkerson", "movie", "spann", "supremacy", "review", "mr", "bill", "reckons", "fired", "racial"], "polarity": 0.04540441176470589, "subjectivity": 0.3202205882352941},

I can relate to self-loathing. The reason a person lashes out the way Dixon does is because he hates himself, so anybody can relate to that.

But he\u2019s very flawed, and it\u2019s a boy-to-man journey.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThere\u2019s been criticism that your character got away scot-free for his racist behavior and for throwing a guy out the window, and never being brought to justice.\n\nIt\u2019s a small town and, who knows, in real life maybe he would have gotten thrown in prison. It\u2019s a sort of dark fairy tale in certain ways \u2014 it\u2019s not necessarily meant to be completely realistic. And if it is meant to be realistic, in real life, things aren\u2019t tied up in a bow. People who deserve to get punished don\u2019t necessarily get punished.\n\nDid it surprise you that there was criticism of the movie along these lines?\n\nNo, whenever a movie is popular and it is a complex dramatic story, I think it\u2019s going to stir up a lot of feelings. A lot of good stuff come out of it \u2014 the billboards that have been popping up [activists recreated versions of the billboards in Miami and London]. That\u2019s kind of incredible, when a movie can effect social change, that\u2019s kind of astounding. I think Mildred [the film\u2019s mother, played by Frances McDormand, who is seeking justice in the murder of her daughter] is a really beautiful working-class wonder woman in some ways. It\u2019s a kind of antihero slash protagonist thing that I think women really need right now. Mildred and [the directors] Greta Gerwig and Patty Jenkins. It\u2019s been an incredibly vibrant year.\n\nYou\u2019re a really good dancer \u2014 you can really bust a move. You did the splits on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d How did that come about? Is it self-taught?\n\nIt\u2019s a long story, but I hung out with a certain crowd, and it was a way to meet girls.\n\nWhat kind of certain crowd?\n\nSan Francisco is not all cable cars and Rice-A-Roni. There were some tough kids there. When I was in middle school, there was a more white supremacist kind of group I didn\u2019t get along with. I got in a lot of fights with them and didn\u2019t win a lot of those fights. I didn\u2019t get along with the rich kids, people we called WPODs: white punks on dope. My school was interracial, and I met a cool group of friends who introduced me to some other friends. I used to do really bad break dancing, when \u201cThriller\u201d and \u201cPurple Rain\u201d came out. I was into Run-DMC, Grandmaster Flash, Doug E. Fresh, Eric B. & Rakim. Probably my biggest inspiration was James Brown, and watching Tom Cruise in \u201cRisky Business.\u201d I remember practicing that, and watching James Brown do the splits. I [recently] did SoulCycle, I\u2019m not proud to say, and Usher was next to me. I thought I had rhythm until I was on a bicycle next to Usher. This is what happens when you go to spinning class in Hollywood.\n\nWere you intimidated working with Frances McDormand?\n\nI think it\u2019s the biggest compliment to Frances that people are asking, \u201cWere you intimidated by her?\u201d Not really, but I was nervous to get in the ring with a great actor. I\u2019ve worked with a lot of great actors. She\u2019s really a force. I think what\u2019s great about her is her integrity. Her sense of truth is like an iron bar. All these people \u2014 Woody [Harrelson, a co-star], Martin [McDonagh, the film\u2019s writer-director], Frances \u2014 are true anarchists, they really are. I think it comes through in their work. I\u2019m not exactly conventional either.\n\nSo your dad posted a comment on that New York Times essay criticizing the film \u2014 he defended you. Was it definitely your dad?\n\nYes that was my father. I didn\u2019t read the article, but they read that quote to me on the Jimmy Kimmel show. That was my dad being a supportive father. He was just looking out for the kid.", "keywords": ["movie", "character", "think", "rockwell", "hes", "thats", "lot", "sam", "secret", "kind", "past", "actor", "break", "bad", "dancer", "really", "york"], "polarity": 0.20883392294682618, "subjectivity": 0.5147564353209513},

While it may not be a common vantage point, the narrative is a natural one for Marilyn Stern, a photographer and graphic artist who is a member of the Metropolitan Postcard Club of New York City.\n\nNot surprisingly, the vast majority of postcards that feature black people in the United States from the 19th and 20th centuries were very racist, she said.\n\n\u201cI was so sick of seeing these horrible racist stereotypes,\u201d said Ms. Stern, a collector since the mid-1970s. \u201cWhenever I came across something that was not racist or not stereotypical, or even went so far as showing romance between the races, I wanted to save it and collect it.\u201d\n\nHer collection, which numbers about 3,000, has about 300 postcards that depict African-American life in all lights.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard for us to fathom how isolated people were, especially in rural areas and isolated small towns before there were telephones and radios,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were postal deliveries three times a day, so it was the internet of the early 1900s.\u201d\n\nPostcards had better printing technology than magazines and newspapers did at the time, as the burst of color in the selection below shows. They could show racism with clarity. \u201cThe idea that you could see images so realistic blew people away,\u201d she said.\n\nMany of the racist postcards were a form of propaganda, she said.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important to see how racism was manifested in the past,\u201d she said, \u201cperhaps to better fight it in the present. You can recognize something if you\u2019ve seen it before.\u201d\n\nBelow is a selection from Ms. Stern\u2019s collection with descriptions based on her research.\n\nTrade Cards\n\nImage\n\nAfrican-Americans were often subjects \u2014 and targets \u2014 of advertising cards that were issued before 1900. These cards were frequently given away in products, or with the purchase of a product.\n\nAbove, an advertisement for J & P Coats thread. Below, a country doctor dispensing Ayer\u2019s Cathartic Pills.\n\nImage\n\nThe Cakewalk\n\nImage\n\nThe Cakewalk, a dance created by plantation slaves as a satire of Southern white society, was the focus of these cards, which featured two black children and an African-American troupe that toured Europe in the late 1800s and early 1900s.\n\nRacist Cards\n\nImage\n\nThe card on the left was shot in a professional studio, but it was labeled \u201cHer Country Cousins.\u201d The implication was that no matter how refined, educated or successful black Americans became, they were still basically savages, Ms. Stern said.\n\nThe two cards on the right were produced in 1905 in New York on the common theme of the delivery stork. The first one, with the caption \u201cComparing Notes,\u201d shows both a black baby and a white baby, with no apparent bias. The second one shows two black babies with the slogan \u201cNo Race Suicide,\u201d implying that a high black birthrate threatened white supremacy, she said.\n\n\u201cLovers of All Nations\u201d\n\nImage\n\nThis postcard was from a series mailed in 1908 that was called \u201cLovers of All Nations.\u201d The banjo was a racial stereotype, but the card is in the non-discriminating \u201cFamily of Man\u201d tradition.\n\nMemories of Slavery\n\nImage\n\nPostcards once served as documentary photography. Some cards honored older African-Americans of the South, who were living memories of slavery. This was part of a series, and it was mailed in 1906.\n\nLife in the Jim Crow South\n\nImage\n\nA fortuneteller with white clients, mailed in 1908.\n\nHoliday Greetings\n\nImage\n\nIdealized country life, in a card mailed in 1907, as Americans flocked to cities.\n\nReligion\n\nImage\n\nA card, likely from the early 1950s, urging parishioners to come to church.\n\nReal Photos\n\nImage\n\nAn unidentified young woman in her graduation cap and gown, in a studio portrait taken between the 1920s and \u201940s. Cards labeled \u201cReal Photo Postcards\u201d are set apart from commercially printed postcards and are actual photographs printed on photographic paper with a preprinted postcard back.\n\nAchievement\n\nImage\n\nThe many important contributions that African-Americans made to society were rarely acknowledged in older postcards, but an exception was made for the scientist and educator George Washington Carver.\n\nHis experiments with peanuts, sweet potatoes and other crops contributed greatly to the economy of the South. This card \u2014 from a photo shot on Kodachrome or Ektachrome film \u2014 is from the late 1950s to mid-60s.\n\nFor more, see Ms. Stern\u2019s postcard blog, and a review of the film Through a Lens Darkly that deals with African-American representation in postcards and photography.

But those seeking to dismiss their stories of pain and demands for equality argued that the payments were proof that their accounts could not be trusted.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cYou get this idea immediately after the war, during these testimonies, that people talking about civil rights are literally getting paid\u201d to tell fabricated stories, Ms. Richardson said.\n\nThat belief spread to other contexts, too. Testimony from African-Americans on the violence perpetrated by the Ku Klux Klan, for example, was explained away as funded falsehoods.\n\n\u201cThey were attracted by a fee of two dollars per diem, and in many cases were evidently drilled for the occasion,\u201d one politician said of the testimony, according to an 1871 news report. The accounts, he said, were \u201cof the lowest kind and utterly unworthy of belief.\u201d\n\nTo Ms. Richardson, those early dismissals of African-American testimony, starting with the congressional hearings during the Reconstruction era, are not unlike the false theories spread about the Parkland school shooting suggesting that the student survivors were actors paid to protest for gun control.\n\n\u201cThat actually sounds very much like what you got in those first congressional hearings,\u201d she said.", "keywords": ["smear", "goes", "violence", "isnt", "spread", "idea", "civil", "crisis", "nonviolent", "richardson", "era", "actor", "sign", "africanamericans", "war", "testimony", "york"], "polarity": 0.07269919269919271, "subjectivity": 0.43285187785187784},

I love you guys.\u201d\n\nSeemingly channeling Earnhardt, who went by the nickname The Intimidator, Dillon bumped the leader Aric Almirola on the last lap, pushing him into the wall before zooming past.

As he took the interview podium in the media workroom, his mother, Desiree Wallace, ran up and hugged her son as both melted into tears.

Alex Bowman, 24, who replaced Earnhardt in the No. 88 car for Hendrick Motorsports, will start the Daytona 500 from the pole position.

A graduate of Nascar\u2019s Drive for Diversity program, Darrell Wallace Jr., 24, could give stock car racing something it has never had before: an African-American star.\n\nBut that is not why Richard Petty brought Wallace onto his team. Late last season, Wallace, who goes by the nickname Bubba, got four rides with Richard Petty Motorsports. It was enough for Petty, one of Nascar\u2019s most iconic names, to not only give Wallace a full-time ride, but also to give him his famed No. 43 racecar to drive. Wallace is the first African-American to drive full-time in the top Nascar series since Wendell Scott in 1971.\n\nPetty insisted, though, that he is colorblind when it comes to evaluating talent. Sure, it would be great if Wallace brings the sport into the African-American community, but as far as Petty is concerned, that\u2019s secondary.\n\n\u201cI hope he advances us as a race team,\u201d Petty said in an email. \u201cI care about what Bubba can do behind the wheel for us. The rest, there are a lot of eyes on Bubba, but he\u2019s handling it well. I know come Sunday he\u2019ll be ready to get into a racecar and just show his talent. If he does well, the rest will come and he\u2019ll grow our fan base.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThose eyes on Wallace, much as they were on Tiger Woods a generation ago, prompted Earnhardt to call him last week. The son of racing legend, Earnhardt knows all about the pressure of expectations.\n\n\u201cHe told me that the next few weeks will basically be hell with all the off-the-track stuff,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cBut he said it\u2019ll all be worth it because I have an opportunity to do things outside the sport that not many other drivers will ever say they\u2019ve had that kind of opportunity to do. So embrace it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe child of a white father and a black mother, Wallace said that he does not quite understand why his skin color makes him newsworthy in 2018.

But there\u2019s also venturing out into a different market, into different avenues where the African-American culture lives. We all have to do better at that.\u201d\n\nThere are challenges, of course. On social media, where vulgar epithets can be spewed from faceless and fictitious monikers, Wallace has, at times, had to think twice before responding. He admits he has not always been successful.\n\n\u201cThere is always going to be haters out there, people who don\u2019t want to see you succeed,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been told that since Day 1 from my parents. Just keep your head down and keep moving, that\u2019s the best you can do.\u201d\n\nBlaney, his closest friend on the circuit, has been around Wallace when offensive remarks have been made.\n\n\u201cThankfully, it\u2019s very, very rare, but it upsets me,\u201d Blaney said. \u201cBubba\u2019s great at handling it. He\u2019s an amazing ambassador for the sport. And he\u2019s really talented and a heck of a competitor. All of us are competitive, but his competitiveness is unlike anyone I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\nNascar\u2019s diversity has become an issue again after its only female racer, Danica Patrick, announced she will retire from the circuit after the Daytona 500. But Wallace is not the only driver who can energize an overlooked community. What he can do for an African-American audience, Su\u00e1rez can do for the Latino market. A native of Monterrey, Mexico, Su\u00e1rez said he had noticed an uptick in social media messages from a variety of Latino countries.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s usually either people who tell me they\u2019re now following the sport because of me, or they\u2019ve been fans and now they have a driver to root for,\u201d said Su\u00e1rez, who is also a graduate of the Drive for Diversity program. \u201cThe potential is huge. This is the most diverse country in the world, but we have to improve diversity in Nascar. If we can make the sport more diverse, we\u2019ll see the same thing with fans. More diversity on the racetrack will mean more diversity in the stands.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, Nascar waits, wondering who will emerge as its next star.", "keywords": ["su\u00e1rez", "wallace", "petty", "racing", "leader", "sport", "hes", "generation", "emerge", "drive", "diversity", "africanamerican", "nascar", "waits"], "polarity": 0.13599389129389128, "subjectivity": 0.4590651755651755},

He became senior editor there in 1958 and later executive editor. He worked for the magazine into his 80s.\n\n\u201cBefore the Mayflower\u201d established Mr. Bennett as a leading scholarly voice during the racial ferment of the 1960s.

Despite his reputation as an emancipator, Mr. Bennett wrote, Lincoln was actually a white supremacist who thought that the races would be better off separated, \u201cpreferably with the Atlantic Ocean or some other large, deep body of water between them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe man\u2019s character, his way with words and his assassination, together with the psychological needs of a racist society, have obscured his contradictions under a mountain of myths,\u201d he added.\n\nIn an interview after the article was published, he stuck to his guns. \u201cLast year, during the riot season, President Johnson said he hoped he would handle himself as Lincoln did during the Civil War,\u201d he said. \u201cIf he does, it will be a disaster.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Bennett expanded on his argument in 2000 in the book \u201cForced Into Glory: Abraham Lincoln\u2019s White Dream.\u201d The historian James M.
