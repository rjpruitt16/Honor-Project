Bannon was asked specific questions that had been negotiated between the White House and the House\u2019s lead counsel.\n\nBannon had been subpoenaed by the committee on Jan. 16 but managed to postpone the subpoena deadline three times as the White House and House lawyers negotiated which questions he could answer without the White House invoking executive privilege to prevent him from testifying.\n\nDemocrat Rep. Adam Schiff of California, ranking member of the committee, told reporters: \u201cThe only questions he would answer were questions that had been scripted, literally scripted for him by the White House. Whenever we sought to probe anything beyond the four corners of the specific wording of the question, he refused to answer. That\u2019s not how executive privilege works.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, lawmakers said that continued noncooperation on Bannon\u2019s part could result in the committee taking steps to hold him in contempt of Congress.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe claims of executive privilege will be looked into by committee member Rep. Mike Conaway (R-Texas), who said that he will work with House Speaker Paul Ryan and House lawyers to determine whether contempt proceedings would be appropriate.\n\nSo the White House was able to script what Bannon told the House Intelligence Committee, but it wasn\u2019t able to do that for Bannon\u2019s meetings with Mueller.\n\nWhich leaves us to wonder what Bannon may have told Mueller. Did he roll over on his former friend and boss? The way he slobbered on the mic for Michael Wolff for the freeski would lead one to believe that under fear of some type of legal recourse against him, he may have done the same with Mueller.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOh, to be a fly on the wall for that.\n\nI need Mueller to drop the bomb already. We\u2019ve been waiting long enough. Yes, I want the investigation to be thorough and to yield the type of fruit that might help us get Trump out of here, but I also want them to hurry the hell up.\n\nEnough is enough.\n\nSo, what do you think Bannon spilled the beans on?

Not only would clarification as to their status be helpful, but it would also seem like the right thing to do given that this administration drew a hard line in the sand over immigration and then built a wall around the line and didn\u2019t get Mexico to pay for it.\n\nAccording to the New York Daily News, while speculation surrounds the president\u2019s in-laws, he continues to ramp up his war on immigrants:\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement announced just this week that they made 40% more arrests in general within President Trump\u2019s first year compared to 2016. ICE claims to have taken 37,734 \u201cnon-criminal\u201d immigrants \u2014 people who don\u2019t have criminal records or those who might face charges \u2014 into custody. That number is more than double the amount of non-criminal arrests made in 2016.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut this is Donald Trump we\u2019re talking about, so would it surprise any of us if we were to find out one day that Trump sent a Russian spy jet to pick up his in-laws and bring them to the United States? Nope.

When it was revealed that both the FBI and White House officials knew about the allegations against both men, it raised questions as to why they were allowed to keep their jobs and whether or not this administration enables abusers.\n\nIn a White House press briefing Monday afternoon, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders asserted that the White House takes the allegations \u201cvery seriously\u201d and believes that they should be \u201cinvestigated thoroughly.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe president and the entire administration take domestic violence very seriously and believe all allegations need to be investigated thoroughly. Above all, the president supports victims of domestic violence and believes everyone should be treated fairly and with due process. We\u2019ve addressed this situation extensively, and we have nothing more to add at this time on that topic,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nWhen asked why we haven\u2019t heard the president himself say that he supports victims, Sanders said, \u201cI spoke with the president. Those are actually directly his words that he gave me.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen pressed on the issue as to why Donald Trump hasn\u2019t said that when he\u2019s had the opportunity to do so, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s my job to speak on behalf of the president. I spoke to him, and he relayed that message directly to me, and I\u2019m relaying it directly to you.\u201d\n\nOh, really?\n\nI seem to recall last summer, when asked why the president was allowed to tweet things about special counsel Robert Mueller, Sanders specifically said that it was not her job to speak for the president.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, is it \u201cOochie Wally\u201d or is it \u201cOne Mic,\u201d Suckabee?\n\nFurthermore, it\u2019s interesting that this is the spin we are being given considering that the president has tweeted on his own about the situation, and what he said is the complete antithesis of what Sanders is saying to the American people now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Saturday, the president wrote on Twitter: \u201cPeoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation. Some are true and some are false. Some are old and some are new. There is no recovery for someone falsely accused\u2014life and career are gone. Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process?\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t sound like a man who supports victims of domestic violence. That sounds like a man who wants to gaslight victims in favor of the men accused.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen asked about the Rob Porter situation Friday, Trump defended Porter publicly and said, \u201cHe says he innocent, and I think you have to remember that.\u201d\n\nThat is the same defense he lobbed for then-Senate candidate Roy Moore back in December when allegations of inappropriate sexual contact with minors emerged about Moore.\n\nAt the time, Trump said, \u201cWell, he denies it. He says it didn\u2019t happen. And you have to listen to him also.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFurthermore, the president himself has been accused 19 times of sexual harassment and sexual abuse\u2014claims that he and the White House have labeled \u201cfake news.\u201d His administration\u2019s policies do not show any amount of care for women who are victims, either. In fact, before he even took office, his team proposed eliminating the Justice Department\u2019s violence-against-women grant programs that allocate funds to organizations that deal with sexual assault and domestic abuse.\n\nAs a woman, I\u2019m not sure how Suckabee reconciles her staunch defense of the president and his bullshit in the wake of the #MeToo movement.

This, of course, comes after reports that the president\u2019s attorneys were trying to negotiate a deal where he would undergo some questioning face-to-face, but be able to answer some questions with written statements that we all know would have been ghostwritten by his attorneys anyway, so what would be the point?\n\nAccording to the New York Times, Trump seems to be unfazed by it all.

It would clear up speculation that the Knavses used their son-in-law\u2019s executive privilege to usurp the system, as he\u2019s been known to do. Not only would clarification as to their status be helpful, but it would also seem like the right thing to do given that this administration drew a hard line in the sand over immigration and then built a wall around the line and didn\u2019t get Mexico to pay for it.\n\nAccording to the New York Daily News, while speculation surrounds the president\u2019s in-laws, he continues to ramp up his war on immigrants:\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement announced just this week that they made 40% more arrests in general within President Trump\u2019s first year compared to 2016. ICE claims to have taken 37,734 \u201cnon-criminal\u201d immigrants \u2014 people who don\u2019t have criminal records or those who might face charges \u2014 into custody. That number is more than double the amount of non-criminal arrests made in 2016.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut this is Donald Trump we\u2019re talking about, so would it surprise any of us if we were to find out one day that Trump sent a Russian spy jet to pick up his in-laws and bring them to the United States?

It was a warm, caring and very emotional speech that we know wasn\u2019t heartfelt because he expressed his true feelings on Twitter around 4 this morning:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTranslation: It\u2019s the students\u2019 and teachers\u2019 fault that the shooting occurred, and they should have screamed about this dangerous kid more.

Sessions replace Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, a Comey friend who was in charge of Clinton investigation?\u201d \u201cHow can FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, the man in charge, along with leakin\u2019 James Comey, of the Phony Hillary Clinton investigation (including her 33,000 illegally deleted emails) be given $700,000 for wife\u2019s campaign by Clinton Puppets during investigation?\u201d he tweeted in December.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Washington Post reports that after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, he asked McCabe during a closed-door meeting whom he voted for during the 2016 election.\n\nThe Hill notes that because McCabe is a civil servant, it was almost impossible to fire him unless there was clear evidence that he\u2019d done something wrong.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear why McCabe decided to retire just months from his retirement, or whether scrutiny over his tenure had intensified. According to CNN, there have been conflicting reports as to what actually took place:\n\nVarious sources described McCabe\u2019s departure as a mutual decision, while others said it was the result of pressure to step down. One source briefed on the matter said McCabe announced his decision to senior executives and portrayed it as his choice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne source told the news network that McCabe\u2019s sudden announcement was not in the plans as of Friday. \u201cHe had enough of being undermined and criticized,\u201d another source said. But Trump and the administration were \u201cnot happy\u201d with him, the same source said, CNN reports.\n\nTrump did not respond when questioned about McCabe\u2019s \u201cstepping aside\u201d\u2014which appears to be the company line.\n\n\n\nClearly, this was never going to work.

Among the anti-Trump comments shared between the two, both called Trump \u201can idiot.\u201d\n\nWhen Strzok\u2019s bosses learned of his text messages with Page, he was removed from his position as top agent on Mueller\u2019s team in late July.

We all know it\u2019s been hard to get over Barack: He took America to meet his family in Kenya, brought some flowers for the National Portrait Gallery; we all know he was a good guy and America misses him.\n\nSeriously, though, what nation in its right mind would want to stay with a leader who is constantly threatening the press, is mired in corruption and built his career on racism, and who was not only accused of rape but also led chants of \u201cBurn the bitch\u201d against his political opponent? All of this sounds a lot like Trump, and you\u2019d think America would say \u201cBoy, bye\u201d to that kind of leader\u2014but we\u2019re still playing \u201che picked me for less than the popular vote\u201d with President Crotch Grabber.\n\nBelieve it or not, the aforementioned actions are by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and/or South African President Jacob Zuma. But unlike the United States, those two nations have had enough and told their leaders that they\u2019ll be sleeping on the couch until the divorce is final. Who knew it would take two second world nations with a bit of backbone to remind America of how dating while democratic is supposed to get done?\n\nOn Tuesday, South Africa\u2019s ruling national party, the African National Congress, called for President Jacob Zuma to step down by Valentine\u2019s Day or face a no-confidence vote. And you know what? He did it. You know that old anthem \u201cWhen a Nation\u2019s Fed Up\u201d? Well, Zuma had this coming to him.\n\nFrom 2005 to the present day, Jacob Zuma has been on one. He\u2019s spent the last decade fighting off 783 counts of bribery and racketeering from an illegal arms deal. He was charged with raping an HIV-positive daughter of a political ally, then claimed that he \u201ctook a shower\u201d after sex to make sure he didn\u2019t have HIV. Then he went outside the courtroom and led chants of \u201cBurn the bitch.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen he \u201cconsensually\u201d knocked up another friend\u2019s daughter. A friend who happened to be chairman of the South African World Cup committee and owner of the popular Orlando Pirates soccer team. That would be like Trump knocking up Patriots owner Robert Kraft\u2019s daughter, then turning around and asking him to promote Boston as the next Summer Olympics site. Zuma did most of this after he was elected to office in 2009. Yes, South Africa was ready to swipe left.\n\nSince Valentine\u2019s Day seems to be the perfect opportunity to cut out of a bad relationship while you still can, the Israeli government has followed the South African example.\n\nOn Tuesday, Israeli police announced that they had \u201csufficient evidence\u201d to charge Prime Minister Benjamin \u201cBibi\u201d Netanyahu with bribery, fraud and \u201cbreach of trust.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNetanyahu, who has been in office since \u201909, tried to buy off a newspaper that was critical of him, authorities charge. Then, in exchange for expensive gifts and favors, he arranged for visas and tried to push through a massive tax cut for Arnon Milchan, a big-time Hollywood producer ( movies like Pretty Woman, JFK and 12 Years a Slave) who wanted to move to Israel, officials say.\n\nHow did Bibi get caught and who ratted him out? Yair Lapid, leader of the Yesh Atid party that is part of Netanyahu\u2019s governing coalition, dropped a dime on the prime minister and has publicly asked him to step down from power. When asked by the press why he stood up to Netanyahu\u2019s pressure, he said:\n\nIn this instance as in other instances, Yesh Atid was the last barrier against government corruption, in the face of politicians occupied solely with themselves and their own well-being.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBang, bang! Shots fired!\n\nCan you imagine House Speaker Paul Ryan or Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ever flipping for special counsel Robert Mueller because the Republican Party was the last barrier against corruption? Can you imagine the Republican Party standing up to Trump\u2019s various wife-beating, sexually assaulting cronies and calling for their removal? Of course not. These guys think #MeToo is a call-and-response for who gets to kiss Trump\u2019s butt at the next staff meeting.\n\nIn high school, we\u2019re taught that American presidents are kept in check by more checks and balances than a block of Wells Fargos, but nobody is doing anything in America about Trump.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet, less democratic states like South Africa have managed to remove a corrupt leader, and in Israel, even if Netanyahu puts up a fight, it\u2019s clear that members of his own coalition are willing to hold him accountable if he strays too far.\n\nAmerica used to be savage like that. The Senate voted on Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment right before Valentine\u2019s Day, over a blow job. Yet somehow, the nation has lost its way with the current trash president, while others act like the nation we used to be.\n\nOn Wednesday, the ANC bought Zuma a nice Nando\u2019s gift certificate and a one-way ticket to GTFOH-istan. In Israel, if Netanyahu somehow survives the charges against him, there\u2019s no chance he\u2019ll be his party\u2019s leader by the 2019 elections.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmerica should totally join the Break Up With Your Terrible Leader Club today.

General Michael T. Flynn (Ret.) After over 33 years of military service to our country, including nearly five years in combat away from my family, and then my decision to continue to serve the United States, it has been extraordinarily painful to endure these many months of false accusations of \u201ctreason\u201d and other outrageous acts. Such false accusations are contrary to everything I have ever done and stood for. But I recognize that the actions I acknowledged in court today were wrong, and through my faith in God, I am working to set things right. My guilty plea and agreement to cooperate with the Special Counsel\u2019s Office reflect a decision I made in the best interest of my family and of our country. I accept full responsibility for my actions.\n\nYes, he did invoke his military service and his faith in God.\n\nClearly, former FBI Director James Comey was not going to let that slide, because he sent out the most epic subtweet, complete with biblical-Scripture quote:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd the accompanying Instagram post shows us just how deep Comey\u2019s petty runs:\n\nAs has been said many times this morning already, this finna be good.\n\nEarlier:\n\nMichael Flynn, the former national security adviser to Donald Trump, pleaded guilty Friday to charges of lying to the FBI about conversations he had with the Russian ambassador last December during the presidential transition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe New York Times reports that Flynn made an appearance in a federal court in Washington, D.C., as part of a plea deal that inches special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election just a bit closer to Donald Trump\u2019s inner circle.\n\nFlynn lasted only 24 days as national security adviser before being forced to resign after it was revealed that he had lied to Vice President Mike Pence about his conversations with Russian officials during the presidential transition.\n\nSo did he really lie to Pence, or was Pence also complicit? Is Jared Kushner now dangling in the wind? Could Flynn be preparing to testify against the president himself?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe charges Flynn pleaded guilty to Friday morning amount to a veritable slap on the wrist in comparison with all the evidence stacked against him, and they are nothing compared with the charges faced by another Trump associate, Paul Manafort.\n\nManafort was charged with conspiracy against the United States, to which he pleaded not guilty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo the question is, with Flynn pleading guilty to this light-as-a-feather charge, what is he getting\u2014and giving\u2014in exchange?\n\nThere is no way Mueller is granting plea deals for small fish. Flynn has to be dropping the goods on someone big\u2014maybe more than one someone.\n\nThis is also a clear indication that Mueller\u2019s team was able to flip Flynn, but not Manafort. Manafort took his lumps, pleaded not guilty to the charges and now waits to see what happens next.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFlynn, on the other hand, was apparently as nervous as a sow at a North Carolina pig-pulling when it became clear that the investigators would stop at nothing to get to the dirt, even if it meant taking his son Michael G. Flynn down with him.\n\nHe was ready to sing, but which song did he pick?\n\nMy money is on the Kushner-Pence-Trump trifecta. For as smug as Pence is, you know he had to know a lot. He did not operate in that campaign in the dark.

Some of the infamous beads thrown into the crowds reflected the image of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee to protest the removal of his statue from New Orleans\u2019 most prominent traffic circle, which has been a symbolic focal point of parade routes\u2014hence the bead\u2019s name, \u201cForever Lee Circle.\u201d\n\n\n\nThere were also Confederate-flag beads, T-shirts and an old image of the statue clandestinely projected on to City Hall. The Lee monument was removed by Mayor Mitch Landrieu on May 19, 2017, after steady pressure from the #TakeEmDownNOLA movement.\n\n\n\nInitially, the bead controversy mostly played out on local blogs and social media, but concerns over racism at Mardi Gras intensified this week after blackface figurines began popping up. In a statement to the Southern Poverty Law Center, \u201cForever Lee Circle\u201d creator \u201cMikas Eaux\u201d insisted that \u201cthe beads serve as a conduit to take the stigma out of Southern history.\u201d\n\nAllies like Save Nola Heritage publicized the trinket as a fun, celebratory way to preserve history, deploying the hashtag #ThrowWhatchaWanna to equate the beads with free speech. But as progressives pointed out, the hashtag ironically evoked the upbeat, brassy jazz anthem \u201cDo Whatcha Wanna,\u201d by Rebirth Brass Band, which is composed entirely of Afro-Creole and African-American musical elements.\n\nThis bitter exchange may seem out of place for an event known for apolitical merrymaking, but the collision of race and revelry is actually in keeping with Mardi Gras\u2019 long racial history. It\u2019s not the first time that white supremacists have used the parade in service of their goals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, the parading tradition itself grows right out of white anxiety over mixing and mingling between free and enslaved, black and white, rich and immigrant.\n\nBefore the 1850s, the New Orleanian celebration was more akin to the Carnevale of Venice, with its egalitarian street-level revelry and festivities. Contemporaneous newspapers and travelers reported sensationalized violence and sexual depravity of new immigrant populations, especially the Irish (who had not yet become white), and the alleged intimacy between white \u201cladies\u201d and masked black men occurring during Carnival.\n\nAfter the Louisiana Purchase, the growing English-speaking, Protestant population attempted to curtail the Carnival tradition celebrated by the Catholic Creoles. Early attempts failed, but by 1856, a tentative alliance between white Americans and white Creoles of the city\u2019s slaveholding and professional classes established the Mistick Krewe of Comus and transformed Carnival into the form we know today, a preapproved parade route followed in a neat, linear fashion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1857 the Comus Krewe introduced the tableaux vivant, or living picture, to Mardi Gras, which featured members of the secret society in elaborate costumes and posed upon lavishly decorated floats. The original floats presented allegories from classic mythology and literature, such as Milton\u2019s Paradise Lost. Members were explicit about their motives\u2014in order to salvage Mardi Gras from what they saw as cultural degeneration, they presented the best of Anglophone culture and art and literally raised the city\u2019s elite white men to aspirational levels above the crowd.\n\nDuring Reconstruction, New Orleans\u2019 white elites used the pomp and ceremony of Mardi Gras to reassert symbolic and political control after the Confederacy\u2019s defeat. The Louisiana Constitution of 1868 ushered in desegregated schools and public transportation, recognized the citizenship of African Americans, and granted the right to vote and hold office to African-American men without property requirements. Local white men perceived this new racial equality as a threat and were eager to recapture their former power.\n\nCarnival krewes took their political arguments to the streets and manipulated their festive displays to provide evidence of the illegitimacy and incongruity of black citizenship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Crescent City Democratic Club, later renamed the Crescent City White League, whose stated goal was to prevent the \u201cAfricanization\u201d of New Orleans and Louisiana, formed the city\u2019s second krewe in 1870. The Twelfth Night Revelers regularly caricatured African-American lawmakers as bumbling crows or backward strongmen.\n\nComus presented its infamous \u201cthe Missing Links to Darwin\u2019s Origin of Species\u201d and \u201cthe Aryan Race\u201d themes in 1873 and 1877, respectively. The former theme culminated with an anthropomorphic crowned gorilla standing in contrast against a white Comus, suggesting the innate inferiority of black men holding civic office. In like fashion, the Knights of Momus displayed comical yet grotesque representations of mixed-race people among equally grotesque animal hybrids in its 1873 parade themed \u201cthe Coming Races.\u201d\n\nMardi Gras had become a mode by which former slaveholders and Confederate sympathizers could maintain symbolic power and communicate ideas of white supremacy, social Darwinism and the \u201cLost Cause\u201d even under the city\u2019s interracial Republican government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOver the last century, African Americans, women and LGBTQ people have all established parading organizations that have at times directly and indirectly challenged the elite white male control of Mardi Gras.\n\nIn recent years, there has been searing political satire of the response to Hurricane Katrina and the 2016 election. This progress, however, only further demonstrates how the revelry and debauchery of Carnival does not have an inherent political bent. Carnival is a fluid, flexible form and, thus, allows for both progressive and prejudiced values to flourish. This year, my social media newsfeed was filled with posts bemoaning the Knights of Chaos\u2019 floats lampooning Colin Kaepernick, kneeling NFL players and Dreamers.\n\nIn the end, sometimes racism looks like swastikas and tiki torches, but sometimes it looks like a parade.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrederick Staidum Jr., Ph.D., is a scholar of 19th-century American culture and literature at Loyola University Chicago and a Public Voices Fellow with the Op-Ed Project.

The city she lived in and schools she attended were mostly white. But when she moved to Campinas, a city of 1 million approximately two hours outside of Sao Paulo, she decided to be proactive.\n\n\u201cI wanted to increase my connection to Afro-Brazilian people,\u201d she says.\n\nThaisa joined Afrodengo, an Afro-Brazilian dating community on Facebook. When she finally got up the nerve to post her photo and introduced herself\u2014a requirement of the community\u2014she noticed that one guy who \u201cliked\u201d her photo lived in her city. His name was Jackson Xavier.\n\nShe reached out to him on Facebook and they immediately started talking. Two days later, they went out on their first date. She instantly liked his intelligence, responsibility and the way he cared for her. He liked her stubbornness, humor and intelligence as well. Five months later, the couple were married. As Jackson explains:\n\nBefore the group, I didn\u2019t even think to look for relationships with black women, and I had never had a black girlfriend. But once I entered the group, I started to focus more on having a relationship with a black person like me because we have similar experiences. The black movement is very strong on the internet, so I entered the group wanting to see more beautiful black people and to have references in my life to black things.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfrodengo was created one year ago by Afro-Brazilian journalist and single mother Lorena If\u00e9, 29, to promote love and marriage among Afro-Brazilians. \u201cDengo\u201d is a word with African roots that Brazilians\u2014especially Afro-Brazilians\u2014call people to show love and care. Despite the country\u2019s African origins, hundreds of years of slavery and European colonialism have made affection and stable relationships between black women and black men in Brazil unique and unusual.\n\nNow Afro-Brazilians are flocking to the Afrodengo Facebook group to build relationships that they never before considered having. But If\u00e9 not only wants to spark love among Afro-Brazilians; she also wants to help them build relationships with one another so that they can combat racism in Brazil. She explains:\n\nHaving relationships between black people is a way to combat racism. Only a black person will know how racism affects you and its consequences in our lives. In a society where we learn to hate ourselves, if we unite with people like us, then we can combat racism with something as simple as having a conscious family.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo jump-start the group, If\u00e9 invited Afro-Brazilian men and women to post photos and descriptions of themselves. Within a week, it exploded\u2014with both members and photos. At one point, If\u00e9 had more than 10,000 people waiting to be approved to the group. If\u00e9 created an environment where every type of black person, regardless of sexuality, sex, religion or political viewpoint, is welcome.\n\nToday the group is still going strong; having produced at least two marriages and countless couples and friendships. There are more than 100,000 members in the main group and its affiliates (which focus on LGBT members, Christians and body positivity). If\u00e9 plans to turn the Facebook group into an app.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Afro-Brazilians enjoy the group, some white Brazilians consider If\u00e9 and the group racist because it is exclusively for black people. For African Americans, a dating site for black people seems obvious. But for Brazilians, communities restricted by race are always frowned upon. White Brazilians also want to be a part of the group.\n\n\u201cTo this day, I have to deny entrance to white people who want to join the group,\u201d If\u00e9 said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe creation of Afrodengo stems from If\u00e9\u2019s personal experiences pursuing amor afrocentrado\u2014\u201dblack love\u201d\u2014 in Salvador, Brazil. While in a relationship with her son\u2019s father, she felt that their relationship lacked the affection she sees given to white women in Brazil. Soon after they broke up, she tried her hand at online dating and even created a profile on Tinder. But although she lives in a city that is more than 80 percent black, she couldn\u2019t find any black men on the platform.\n\nIf\u00e9 says she wasn\u2019t raised with affection\u2014which is common among poor Afro-Brazilians simply trying to survive. Personally, she longs for a black man who will cherish her intelligence and give her affection when she wants\u2014even when she doesn\u2019t need it. She still longs for an \u201cAfrodengo.\u201d\n\nCreating this Afrodengo [was] a way to help me survive and help others going through a similar situation. It helped me to move on from my relationship and survive my depression.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf\u00e9\u2019s struggle is one that many black women in Brazil share. Many of their lives are marked by loneliness (solid\u00e3o da Mulher Negra) because they aren\u2019t chosen\u2014the chosen women being white women. In Brazil, black and mixed-race women have been traditionally oversexualized or looked upon as domestic servants, while white women are viewed as the perfect women to give affection to and to have a healthy marriage with. It is a given that the more money and education an Afro-Brazilian has, the more likely he will marry a white woman.\n\nTranslating from a YouTube video by anthropologist Ana Cl\u00e1udia Pacheco, a professor at the State University of Bahia:\n\nBecause of historical reasons related to racism, many black women in Brazil suffer from solitude. ... Our choices in who we give affection to and who we choose as a partner are still regulated by and structured by racism and sexism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Afrodengo isn\u2019t just for creating romantic relationships; Afro-Brazilian men and women are using the group to strengthen their black identity and create friendships with Afro-Brazilians across Brazil. Says early adopter Gabriel Rangel, 25, from Rio de Janeiro:\n\nI still haven\u2019t found a relationship through Afrodengo, but now I have friends all over the country, and the group has really opened my mind to the Black Movement in Brazil.\n\nMember Lais Mello entered the group one week after it launched. Adopted by a white family, she\u2019d lacked a strong connection to Afro-Brazilian culture. She created the first city-specific WhatsApp group for Afrodengo, which helped her organize meetups in Salvador and make friends with Afro-Brazilians close to her town in Bahia. Now Mello is a moderator of the group, and credits Afrodengo with increasing her self-esteem and pulling her out of depression:\n\nBefore Afrodengo, I wouldn\u2019t leave the house because of my depression and anxiety. My self-esteem was so low. But now I love going to Afrodengo meetups.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf\u00e9 has grand plans for the Afrodengo brand. The first thing she wants to do is get off of Facebook and create an app for the group. She\u2019s currently looking for funding and support, and plans to apply to the Vale de Dend\u00ea accelerator, which is targeting Afro-Brazilian startups based in Salvador.", "keywords": ["love", "group", "making", "afrodengo", "relationships", "afrobrazilian", "easier", "women", "afrobrazilians", "white", "if\u00e9", "brazil", "style", "black"], "polarity": 0.10571208112874778, "subjectivity": 0.43239417989417983},

Flynn, who worked as a part of Flynn Intel Group. The younger Flynn accompanied his father in 2015 on the trip to Russia where the elder Flynn appeared at a Moscow dinner sitting next to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nIn addition, ABC News reports that Democrats in Congress forwarded information to the Mueller team allegedly showing that during his confirmation process, Flynn illegally concealed more than a dozen foreign contacts and overseas trips.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a letter to Flynn\u2019s attorney, Democratic Reps.

As the Washington Post reports, the 32-year-old carpenter grew concerned about the safety of his 3-year-old twins and 1-year old son. The Post notes that the early-morning sighting capped \u201ca string of attempted intrusions\u201d into his home in recent weeks.\n\nSo Rodriguez did what many might do when confronted with a stranger on their property: He called the cops.\n\nThe officers did find the trespasser but didn\u2019t arrest him because they had no probable cause, police say. They did end up arresting Rodriguez. As CNN reports, after asking for his ID, cops discovered that he had an outstanding warrant they believed to be criminal. Not long after calling the police to investigate a possible intruder, Rodriguez, who is an undocumented immigrant, found himself in the back of a squad car.\n\nHere\u2019s what happened next, according to the Post:\n\nRodriguez overheard an officer discussing by speakerphone with a voice on the other end of the line. It was Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Cortes said. \u201cDo you want us to bring him to you?\u201d the officer asked, Rodriguez later recalled. \u201cThat would be great,\u201d the voice responded. Minutes later, the officers left Rodriguez at a nearby ICE field office. Rodriguez was shackled and later taken to the Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma, one of the largest detention facilities in the nation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs it turns out, the warrant wasn\u2019t criminal at all. According to the Tukwila Police Department\u2019s own admissions, it misinterpreted the nature of the warrant against Rodriguez. It was actually an administrative warrant, related to a missed court hearing from 2004, when authorities in Texas discovered that he had entered the country illegally.\n\nRodriguez\u2019s lawyer, Luis Cortes Romero, told the Post that his client never received the notice to attend the mandatory court meeting, but missing it triggered a removal order.\n\nThis makes Rodriguez\u2019s arrest, essentially, a mistake. The Tukwila PD confirmed that it \u201cdoes not respond to U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement requests to detain individuals on their behalf.\u201d The only reason Rodriguez was arrested was that his administrative warrant appeared like a criminal one in the National Criminal Information Center database.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite this, Immigration and Customs Enforcement now refuses to release Rodriguez, according to his lawyer. He maintains that his client has no criminal record. Rodriguez could be deported within a matter of days, leaving his young children without a father.\n\n\n\nThe arrest falls in line with one of the more troubling trends of the Donald Trump administration. Arrests of noncriminal undocumented immigrants have skyrocketed in the last year. The Washington Post found that ICE had detained 37,734 undocumented \u201cnoncriminal\u201d immigrants in 2017. This was twice the number arrested in Barack Obama\u2019s final year as president.\n\n\n\nAside from the obvious concerns, of upending the lives of thousands of people and disrupting families and communities, the immigrant crackdown has also triggered a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on crime reporting across the country. Undocumented immigrants who are the victims of crimes like robbery and sexual assault have refused to report them for fear of being handed over to ICE, according to police and immigration advocates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Police Department, which says it has \u201cworked tirelessly\u201d to develop and maintain relations with its large immigrant and refugee population, says that it will not be responding to administrative warrants from ICE going forward.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Rodriguez\u2019s lawyer has requested a stay of removal for the carpenter on humanitarian grounds, the Post reports.

I don\u2019t have any issue with him being a black Republican. I think many black Democrats, independents and definitely Hoteps fall into this trap of placing black Republicans at the heel of the white man, but I am not one of them. I believe that you can be a black Republican who just views things differently.\n\nBut beneath all of that is Pastor Mark Burns, a man so scorned that he is living in a bizarro Wakanda in which black people are living on sharecropped land that they believe they own but is really in the master\u2019s yard.\n\nOn the surface, Burns is an easily dismissible figure; he\u2019s a black pastor stumping for Donald Trump. If that isn\u2019t enough, he wears really short, fat Laurel-and-Hardy-esque ties (see below), and if you can make it past his tie, which looks like a cutoff sweatpants leg, then don\u2019t forget that he also lied about his entire r\u00e9sum\u00e9, and when he was called out on it during a live interview, he walked out. For all his heavy breathing and pastoral pauses, Burns could easily be labeled a huckster and placed into a box along with the rest of the sunken-place Trump supporters.\n\nBut we live in a social media world that trades likes and follows as digital currency, and in this sense, Burns is balling.

That kind of television changes a kid. I can\u2019t imagine the kind of woodsy upbringing that allows a black man in 2018, the year of our lord and savior Sterling K. Brown, to tweet this:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat happened. And this man is ministering to other black people. He\u2019s widening his platform daily and is one of the few public black faces that are helping to grease the asses of other black folks so that Trump\u2019s foot can fit. I don\u2019t understand how a Southern black man becomes this way, but it has me thinking that it was beaten out of him. And if so, that means that the whipping of blacks is still alive\u2014but I just can\u2019t imagine a world where you not only voluntarily allow yourself to be whipped but also actually sell it to your own people.\n\nIt\u2019d be one thing if Burns didn\u2019t have an audience, but someone is paying attention to his message, and it isn\u2019t just Southern whites and Russian bots.

Plessy was removed from a train, sparking the infamous Supreme Court decision \u201cseparate but equal,\u201d is visual artist Brandan \u201cBmike\u201d Odums\u2019 Studio Be.\n\n\n\nOutside the 35,000-square-foot warehouse, the walls are spray-painted yellow and red. A little black girl painted in shades of purple stares and smiles, her palms facing upward, her curls encased in a halo. A poem about a wild, beautiful girl who was a shelter hints at what you\u2019ll find inside.\n\nStudio Be is that shelter, not just for Bmike\u2019s first solo show, \u201cEphemeral Eternal,\u201d but for glorious blackness. It features spray-painted images of civil rights icons, art installations replicating Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath, and paintings of locals that change the conversation around who gets to be considered beautiful and holy.\n\n\u201cI think there is a lot of redemptive power in understanding your presence in the continuum,\u201d Bmike tells The Root of the reason behind his show\u2019s name. \u201cAnd knowing that you\u2019re not just an isolated incident, that somehow your existence is in a way part of a relay race, or a elevator, or escalator of moments.\u201d\n\nOver the past two years, Studio Be has become a hot spot for celebrities, tourists and students looking to experience the elevation and celebration of street art. RZA has just wrapped the film he directed, Cut Throat City, starring Wesley Snipes, Kat Graham and T.I., inside Studio Be.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDave Chappelle loved the show so much that he came back again with his wife and kids, buying pieces to hang in his home. Ava DuVernay filmed a scene for her hit show Queen Sugar at Studio Be, heavily featuring Bmike\u2019s paintings of slain Black Lives Matter icons Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Eric Garner and Oscar Grant. Encapsulating the theme of a moment in time that ripples throughout time, the four hold protest signs modeled after those from the civil rights movement, reading \u201cI Am a Man.\u201d\n\nIn a meta way of art imitating life inspiring art, Bmike\u2019s paintings are used in the episode to teach a young teenager about black history. The studio itself has a \u201cyoung artists in residence\u201d wall where an average of four classes of students who tour the show a week can color in the black-and-white printouts of his paintings and take them home or hang them on the wall, along with phrases in chalk describing what they\u2019ve learned.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat part of it is, to me, more important than the superstars coming and the Queen Sugars happening,\u201d he says of the impact celebrities have on his ability to bring more kids to his show. \u201cIt\u2019s more beautiful when the kids come in and we\u2019re able to connect.\u201d\n\nBut just as Bmike and Studio Be are connecting with kids and finding their place in pop culture, the show is expected to close\u2014likely by the summer. Before it\u2019s taken apart and taken on the road, to be featured in studios around the country, The Root traveled to New Orleans to catch up with Bmike and experience \u201cEphemeral Eternal\u201d firsthand.\n\nIt is, in a word, dope.\n\n\n\nBroken into four rooms, the show begins with hope in the midst of struggle. In a piece painted on the front wall, a black woman stares down the barrel of a policeman\u2019s gun and plugs it with a rose. The slain Black Lives Matter icons are crowned with halos. Fannie Lou Hamer, James Baldwin, Toni Morrison, Muhammad Ali and Fred Hampton commune in various murals, a buffet of incontrovertible black excellence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs one stands in the doorway looking into the second room, it almost looks as if the wall that Coretta Scott King is painted on is connected to the one Martin Luther King Jr. is painted on. From that angle, she\u2019s looking directly at him, and the words on both walls read from left to right, \u201cLove Supreme.\u201d But as you enter the \u201cLove\u201d room, there is an obvious, wide gap between Coretta\u2019s and Martin\u2019s walls. It signifies, for Bmike, the complexity of their relationship.\n\n\u201cMaybe [King] just loved a little bit too much, because some of his behavior as a human, people could find problematic, and I wanted to explore that but not in a subtle way,\u201d he says. Noting that much of MLK\u2019s infidelities were thrown in Coretta\u2019s face and yet she stayed with him, Bmike paints Coretta with an ambivalent look as she eyes her husband. \u201cMaybe she just had a better, a higher understanding of love and her love for him,\u201d he speculates with his work. \u201cShe\u2019s looking at him like, \u2018I see you, but I see you.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn continuing to challenge how we view and define heroes, that room contains an old phone booth papered over with the FBI\u2019s redacted files on King.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAllegedly, those [redacted] areas are supposed to be lifted in 2027, 2028, I think. So, what happens when we learn new information about Dr. King and the humanity of Dr. King? Would that change the way we preserve that eternal image of him?\u201d\n\nThose questions continue on the other side of King\u2019s wall to the most controversial of the pieces. Bmike has painted Black Panther leader and convicted rapist Eldridge Cleaver, along with words from one of Cleaver\u2019s love letters in his book Soul on Ice, which, within the context of love, Bmike admits is \u201ca totally different hurricane of ideas and emotions.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAs a young kid in college, it really awakened me to this idea of black consciousness, in a way,\u201d he says of Cleaver\u2019s writing. \u201cBut then as I would share this with people, especially women would be very upset, especially because I overlooked or didn\u2019t focus on the fact that one of the reasons he was in jail was because he was raping women, and he had a way of justifying it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCourtesy of Studio Be Muhammad Ali mural at Studio Be.

That\u2019s the beauty of art, I think; it doesn\u2019t really remain one thing.\u201d\n\nPaintings of tatted-up locals as Black Jesus and Black Mary also used to mirror each other in this room, but a lucky patron took Jesus into his home, leaving the Holy Mother to bless the room on her own. In the very Catholic city of New Orleans, it\u2019s no small thing to make a black woman the pillar of God\u2019s love.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat love is challenged as you move into the most devastating room in the warehouse. Half of a wooden ship sticks out of the wall, part slave ship, part rescue boat for the refugees of Hurricane Katrina. In the far-right corner sits what appears to be a regular living room: a floor lamp, TV, couch, family portraits on the wall. The bottom half of the portrait is covered in purple paint; then you notice that the rest of the wall is covered in purple, too, along with the entire couch, the floor lamp and all of the TV. Then it hits you: The purple paint is the water line, and everything below it is what was baptized when the levees broke.\n\n\n\nAn installation in the middle of the room is the eye of the hurricane, with white clouds and wind and shadows, and words for the survivors: \u201cYou\u2019re Still Here.\u201d A video compilation captures the dichotomy of the storm: Old gospel songs play over footage of thousands of black folks getting baptized in a river, intercut with footage from failed Katrina rescue efforts, Kanye West\u2019s \u201cGeorge Bush doesn\u2019t care about black people\u201d moment, and a cartoon of Noah\u2019s family praying and trembling inside the ark.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe final room brings you back to the beginning. The murals Bmike painted in abandoned and dilapidated buildings after Katrina that brought him to prominence a few years ago have been cut out of the walls and installed in Studio Be. As one looks back at these early murals of King, Malcolm X, Nina Simone and more, his growth in skill and theme over the past five years is apparent.\n\n\u201c[There was a time everyone had] halos and crowns,\u201d he says of his earlier pieces. But after a conversation with a mentor, his idea of the over-assertion of black royalty and black godliness became unnecessary. \u201cHe asked me, \u2018Why, at the expense of feeling less than human, do we have to boast a superhuman identity? Why we can\u2019t just be like, \u2018I\u2019m human, and that\u2019s enough for you to love and respect me?\u2019 And that kind of changed how I created from that point.\u201d\n\nNow a painting of a black teen girl, wearing a simple black T-shirt, hangs in his studio with the powerful message, \u201cI Am My Ancestors\u2019 Wildest Dreams.\u201d A millennial black man, tatted up and shirtless, re-creates an iconic photo by drinking from a water fountain marked \u201cWhite Only,\u201d eyes staring into you. Before it sold, a painting hung of another young black boy in a red tee standing next to the word \u201cAlchemist.\u201d Three kids. Just humans. All worthy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was like, OK, how can I approach paintings like that and say it\u2019s enough that this person exists? I don\u2019t need to add a crown or a halo to force somebody to be like, \u2018Oh, this person is valuable,\u2019\u201d he says.\n\nThough these revelations in the form of Studio Be will only be around for a short while longer, Bmike\u2019s work isn\u2019t going anywhere. In honor of New Orleans\u2019 300th anniversary, Bmike has been commissioned to paint a series of murals highlighting the hidden history of people and communities throughout the city.\n\nHis goal remains for black kids to see value in themselves when they walk away from his work, in whatever context.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI want them to see a different prism of their potential and possibility,\u201d he says. When kids walk through his studio and say, \u201cI could do that,\u201d it\u2019s the most exciting thing for him: \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018Yes! You can! I hope you do it better.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn that way, he says, the art lives forever.", "keywords": ["glorious", "room", "love", "queen", "root", "celebrating", "bmike", "blackness", "wall", "way", "painted", "orleans", "studio", "featured", "art", "sugar", "odums", "black", "paint"], "polarity": 0.1028882432146764, "subjectivity": 0.4517228489839952},

So to circumvent that, Mueller is using a secret weapon to prevent those pardons from happening.\n\nMueller has added Michael Dreeben to his team, according to Bloomberg. Dreeben is a career government lawyer who has the distinction of being one of only eight people in history to argue before the U.S. Supreme Court more than 100 times.\n\nSince Mueller brought him on, Dreeben has spent his time researching presidential pardons and figuring out what, if any, limits to them exist. He will also serve to make sure that everything Mueller does in a prosecutor capacity is legally airtight.\n\nIn reference to Dreeben, Kathryn Ruemmler of Latham & Watkins LLP\u2014 who was White House counsel under President Barack Obama\u2014told Bloomberg: \u201cHe\u2019s seen every criminal case of any consequence in the last 20 years.

He lost to a private practice lawyer by the name of John Roberts, the same John Roberts who is now chief justice of the United States.\n\nJust what Dreeben will be able to help Mueller achieve remains to be seen, but the simple fact that Mueller is stacking his deck in his own favor shows that this Russia probe is far from over and is likely on the way to yielding some low-hanging fruit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at Bloomberg.", "keywords": ["filed", "lawyer", "try", "spent", "solicitor", "pardon", "secret", "court", "criminal", "friends", "weapon", "seen", "supreme", "bloomberg", "mueller", "prevent", "trump", "dreeben", "help", "special"], "polarity": 0.10190476190476191, "subjectivity": 0.4786375661375661},

The Trump administration temporarily expanded this guest-worker program in 2017 while restricting other avenues of legal immigration, including the H-1B program for high-skilled workers. The Trump Organization is exactly the kind of company that relies on the H-2B visa program for low-skilled workers. Vox reviewed recruiting files submitted to the US Department of Labor for two Trump properties in Florida (including Mar-a-Lago) and one in New York from the start of 2016 through the end of 2017. In that period, hiring managers said they were able to find and hire only one qualified American worker \u2014 a cook \u2014 for 144 open positions for servers, cooks, housekeepers, and bartenders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Vox, all of the businesses owned by Trump appeared to suffer from the same issue: They\u2019d post a job listing and then no one applied or was skilled enough to do the work.\n\n\n\nThe hiring manager at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Fla., noted that only seven U.S. workers applied for jobs. Mar-a-Lago jobs allowed workers to make anywhere from $10.33 per hour for housekeepers to $13.43 for cooks and $11.88 for servers (no tips).\n\n\n\nApparently, no Americans wanted to work at Trump\u2019s Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., property, as Vox reports that no one applied for any of the available positions.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe New York Daily News notes that after the Trump administration got the cap raised on H-2B visas, \u201cthree days later Trump properties put in a request to bring on 76 guest workers.\u201d\n\n\n\nThere is no magic here.", "keywords": ["program", "jobs", "vox", "american", "guest", "h2b", "needed", "believe", "employees", "foreign", "maga", "actually", "properties", "trump", "trumps", "workers", "hired"], "polarity": 0.09428970152654365, "subjectivity": 0.4257651705020125},

In those memos, Comey wrote about each time the president attempted to manipulate, dominate, bully and outright obstruct the federal investigation into Russian involvement in the election.\n\nMueller was appointed special counsel after a memo written by Comey revealed that the president had attempted to get him to put an end to the FBI\u2019s investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe was appointed to both investigate the Russian collusion and look into whether or not the president had obstructed justice.\n\nObstruction of justice appears to be the larger part of Mueller\u2019s focus at this time, but he is still gathering information on possible Russian interference. Sessions, who was head of the Trump campaign\u2019s foreign policy team, can answer questions on the campaign\u2019s ties to the Russians as well as on whether or not Trump tried to obstruct the investigation.\n\nRemember, Trump was very upset when Sessions recused himself from the Russia investigation last year and even said in an interview that he never would have given Sessions the job of attorney general if he had known that was going to happen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClearly, Sessions has tea to spill.\n\nThis is all leading up to the eventual interview between Trump and Mueller, during which the president will likely be questioned about his decisions to send both Flynn and Comey packing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump\u2019s team are already preparing themselves for the inevitable.

(Because of legislative and city-charter changes, Cantrell, who was elected Nov. 18, will be sworn in May 7.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMy vision [for New Orleans] is for real inclusion and real equity in this city to where we truly are meeting people where they are regardless of who and race, as well,\u201d she says. \u201cThat manifests itself in many different ways: in real growth and opportunity; being able to be connected to not just a job but professional growth opportunities as well; starting your own business; the quality of education is the same no matter where you are.\u201d\n\nMentioning the fact that New Orleans\u2019 incarceration rate is nearly double the nationwide rate, Cantrell shares her commitment to strengthening community support to decrease crime, and re-entry programs to help the formerly incarcerated have another chance at a full life.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to build people up so that they can feel their worth in their city,\u201d she says of her upcoming administration\u2019s focus on the most vulnerable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how I\u2019m going to measure myself: How am I impacting the most vulnerable?\u201d she adds. \u201cPeople who have done well, they\u2019ve done well and they should be able to continue to do well, but it shouldn\u2019t be at the expense of those who cannot and do not have an opportunity to do well.\u201d\n\nRecently, Cantrell released her transition plan, consisting of six committees, 19 subcommittees and 12 working groups that will advise the mayor-elect on policies in key areas\u2014from transportation to education.\n\n\u201cWe will be focusing on neighborhood stabilization, economic development and growth, public safety [and] infrastructure improvements as well as healthy families,\u201d says Cantrell.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the key to both her election and her upcoming administration, she says, will be accountability.\n\n\u201cNew Orleanians will tell you straight,\u201d she says. \u201cSo accountability is continuing to be accessible; having, again, that ability to listen to people. You\u2019re accountable by being able to demonstrate that you have listened because it needs to culminate into some level of action that impacts people.\u201d\n\nThat action, she says, must be open to scrutiny: \u201cWhen you remain accessible, that means you\u2019re not hiding from them, so you\u2019re always open to the criticisms, the feedback, the input, the ideas\u2014and I just plan to continue to be that way.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs an example, Cantrell shares the story of one of her supporters, \u201cMs. Helen,\u201d who texted her the day before our chat: \u201cShe said, \u2018It\u2019s amazing. A woman who was homeless can text the next mayor. How is that?!\u2019 And I say, \u2018Ms. Helen, nothing\u2019s changing!\u2019 That gives people hope that they\u2019ve been a part of something and will continue to be a part of something.\u201d\n\nAcknowledging that women, and particularly black women, are the backbone of society and have been socialized to nurture communities, Cantrell also shares ideas for electing black women to office, not as a trend or an anomaly, but as something communities will get behind consistently.\n\n\u201cWe have to support women who are doing the work on the ground and being intentional about it,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are women every single day turning it out, doing the job, and are overlooked. They\u2019re not elevated.

But ultimately, I\u2019ve always thought of the internet as a haven for the congregating of niche and segmented voices and a market of hawk-eyed entrepreneurs willing to serve them. So it was much to my surprise when, on some random whim, I Googled \u201cblack atheist dating sites\u201d and came up with ... zilch\u2014a dearth of recent content.\n\n\n\nWhat I did find was like a barren field scattered with abandoned Blogspot posts from 2009 to 2012. WordPress graveyards, old podcasts, small forums and Reddit convos largely expressing exhaustion about being a black atheist trying to date other black people\u2014most of them from men, a particular one aptly titled, \u201cCan Atheist Brothas be Blamed for Looking Outside Their Race for Other Atheist Women?\u201d while another posited, \u201cBlack women would rather date a drug dealer than a black male atheist.\u201d\n\nFascinating stuff. However, after some mild lurking and subsequent cackling, I was left with a few questions. Why on earth isn\u2019t there a dating site for black atheists? What\u2019s dating like for them? What online outlets do they even have for this kind of social mingling? By all accounts, atheists residing in the U.S. in general are a small segment of the population. That number is significantly smaller when you specify black people in America. Despite a growing number of people who prefer to identify as \u201cspiritual\u201d as opposed to Christian, the number of black people who identify as atheist or \u201creligiously unaffiliated\u201d is still marginal. Nonetheless, there still seem to be sites that cater to even smaller niches.\n\nTake Redhead Dates, which serves 1 or 2 percent of the nation\u2019s population of gingers, or others serving sci-fi and sailing enthusiasts, like Trek Passions and Sea Captain Date. There are sites with more obvious utility, like Dating 4 Disabled and Cancer Match, connecting people and communities who share more than a rare genetic trait and hobbyist passions. Finally, we can fall directly into the Hellmouth with obscure places like the Atlasphere\u2014a dating and community website (likely created by Rand Paul and Satan himself) for the tasteless cretins and libertarians who love Ayn Rand books.\n\nOf course, there are a scarce few dating sites for atheists; however, the members look exactly the way you expect them to: a vast sea of taupe with a few colored folks peppered in for good measure. There were a lot less fedoras than I imagined, but I still got the sense that you are one click away from a Richard Dawkins quote and a vigorous defense of The Bell Curve.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI did some more light digging and came up with a Facebook group called Black Atheists Mingle that has a membership totaling 863 people. Still, I found the seeming void in online voices and content from young black atheists and secularists particularly confounding. At a time where every category of black identity is vocalized and monetized and given some visibility on social media, this does not seem to be the case for black people who identify as nonbelievers. Fortunately, I was able to take it to Twitter and ask a few black atheist folk what dating was like with them and what challenges (if any) they face.\n\n\n\nMark, a 36-year-old tech director and Baltimore resident, described his experience in dating as \u201cproblematic\u201d:\n\nI didn\u2019t grow up too religious. My mom is a believer, but she never really pushed it on me. She never really talked to me about it. She does now simply because she has become stronger in her faith. There is an effect. I\u2019ve had women flat out tell me that they couldn\u2019t deal with someone like me. I\u2019ve had a relationship dissolve around the issue. I don\u2019t think that it was an issue in my latest relationship even though she was really religious. I have never dated a black woman (any woman) with the same outlook. I can\u2019t say that I\u2019ve met more than one and she is the homey. Maybe someone should make Black Atheists Meet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTr\u00e9, a 25-year-old Maryland resident, expressed similar experiences:\n\nThere wasn\u2019t a set time where I was like \u201cI don\u2019t believe,\u201d but I remember being in church in my early teens, and they just so happened to start the \u201cgay isn\u2019t OK.\u201d It was in that moment where I started to have that whole Conceited rap battle gif toward religion. Guys that aren\u2019t religious are very rare! Which is weird, considering what the Bible says ... but yeah, some guys can\u2019t handle the God isn\u2019t real \u201cjokes\u201d so they don\u2019t get me/my humor, so dating is harder because of it.\n\nFrom Desmond, 21:\n\nI was born and raised in Nigeria and religion is heavily (and stupidly) interwoven into practically all we do. Most Nigerians are violently religious. My siblings and cousins know I\u2019m atheist but my parents, aunts and uncles don\u2019t.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen asked about his dating life:\n\n\n\nI don\u2019t have a dating life, but I\u2019m fairly certain being atheist would play a major role in it.\n\nNot all men who responded to my questions expressed running into the same road blocks, however.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrian, a 26-year-old receptionist from Brooklyn, N.Y.:\n\nBeing an atheist hasn\u2019t affected my dating life too much, although I briefly clashed with one ex about it because she was Hindu and had her doubts as to whether our differing beliefs could coexist, and also whether or not I took her beliefs seriously. I haven\u2019t met many other Black atheists.\n\nAmong the women who responded, similar experiences were echoed, but their atheist ID didn\u2019t seem to be as polarizing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSydney, a 20-year-old student in Atlanta whose father is a deacon:\n\nI also have trouble dating other atheists because they want to actively bash Christianity and other religions and come from a morally superior background. Personally, I don\u2019t have a problem with religions, Christianity or otherwise. I see how they can be empowering for others even if they don\u2019t do anything for me, so conversations where people talk down on religious people make me very uncomfortable.\n\nMonica, a 32-year-old attorney in Washington, D.C.:\n\nBoth parents Christian (dad Baptist, mom Seventh-day Adventist), raised with a mix of both Baptist and SDA principles. It hasn\u2019t stopped me from dating but leads to lots of debates. Black men tend to want to date women who are Christian, but I try to stay away from devout Christian and aim for \u201cspiritual.\u201d Most of the guys I\u2019ve dated ended up questioning their beliefs rather than shunning me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nR, a 34-year-old physician from Houston:\n\nFirst called myself a nonbeliever from about the first year of college or so, which was 12 years ago. Ive had several men be turned off because they are looking for \u201ca God-fearing woman,\u201d and on dating apps I tend to not even contact men who state how important their faith is. There are not a lot of atheists in this part of the country, so I\u2019ve only dated Christian men, and most of them just figured I\u2019d change or were semi-OK as long as I would come to church sometimes or even pretend for family lol. I went on a date with an agnostic man this past week. That was nice, but it\u2019s not common at all so no real experience with dating atheist men. Would be awesome to meet more while I live here though.\n\nThe responses to my questions were a lot more mixed than I expected. While almost all acknowledged that there are certainly challenges and that it\u2019s generally rare to have never dated other black atheists, a lot professed that they were leading moderate-to-successful dating lives, and in some cases marriages, with theists. Several commented on wanting to \u201cavoid Bill Maher types,\u201d and when it came to finding other black atheists to date, responses ranged from mild enthusiasm to apathy. On the rare occasion, some expressed not even having a lot of chemistry with other black atheists.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJulian Rafael Hassan Roden, a 22-year-old artist from Chicago:\n\nI seem to go after the \u201cgood girl\u201d college type who puts God first. Immediately turns most off \u2019cause a lot are closed-minded, not accepting of the lack of faith. They see it as disrespectful and an attack on theirs. The only Black atheist women I know really aren\u2019t interested in me romantically, nor I to them, as the relationships are based on intellectual conversation mostly, not attraction.\n\nThe eager flood of responses I received, however, did illustrate that while not as rabid and visible in community as some of their white ideological counterparts, black atheists do want a space to express their ideas about faith and God among other black people without fear of reprimand or being ostracized. Phil, an IT professional in his late 40s who expressed being a skeptic since he was a child, told me, \u201cI don\u2019t often get a chance to freely discuss my belief(s) or lack thereof. When I do share the fact that I\u2019m an atheist, I\u2019m often met with derisive laughter or utter disbelief (or both).\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt a time where there has been room made for \u201cgeeky,\u201d \u201cnerdy,\u201d \u201calternative,\u201d \u201cexcellent\u201d and even \u201cawkward\u201d blackness, black atheism and secularism still remain a pretty open and barren field online, and in our ongoing efforts to call for a multifaceted presentation of the black experience, it\u2019s apparently long past due for someone to take up this much-neglected mantle.", "keywords": ["atheist", "dont", "atheists", "lot", "women", "dating", "men", "date", "black", "ive"], "polarity": 0.05948836370348002, "subjectivity": 0.450392211148025},

They targeted civil rights activists for years.\n\nWe really don\u2019t have proof of the Russians doing anything. Why trust these agencies now?\n\nThese are completely legitimate questions that I hear from black folks from time to time on social media and in person. I get it. Black people have a very conflicted relationship with law enforcement, be it local or federal policing. There are plenty of examples throughout the decades of these powerful entities harming black communities. Yet we depend on them to protect and serve us, despite their horrendous records of abuse.\n\nThe FBI has a particularly violent history (and if we are discussing the intelligence community in general, that extends to the present) of being aggressive against black liberation movements. COINTELPRO, for example, was one of the most disruptive anti-black law-enforcement programs the nation has ever waged against black civil rights activists.\n\nYet today the FBI stands as the single most important federal entity that will ultimately determine whether charges should be filed against people in Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign for working with Russian entities to secure his victory on Election Day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJeffrey O.G. Ogbar, a historian at the University of Connecticut who researches the history of law enforcement targeting black people, told me he looks at the FBI the same way he does police agencies, school systems, the military or any other institution in the United States over the course of history. Ogbar brings up the history of the Atlanta Police Department as an example. One-quarter of the officers were once allegedly Ku Klux Klan members, and black officers could not arrest white people until 1960, Ogbar told me. By comparison, today\u2019s Atlanta Police Department is majority African American and has black leadership.\n\n\u201cInstitutions aren\u2019t static,\u201d said Ogbar, who believes the intelligence community\u2019s assessment of Russian collusion. \u201cI can\u2019t see the Atlanta Police Department the same as it was in 1960, any more than I can think [the] FBI is the same as it was in 1960. It doesn\u2019t mean it is incapable of committing some of the same offenses as it did before.\u201d\n\nFor me, one of the toughest facts to respond to is that there is no publicly available smoking gun proof connecting the Democratic National Committee hack and other disinformation efforts to the Kremlin. The intelligence report released (pdf) in January is an assessment of what happened, not proof of an actual crime. It\u2019s the job of the FBI and special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation to figure out if any crime happened from either the Russian or Trump sides.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nC. Christian Grant, who spent 12 years as an FBI and Defense Intelligence Agency officer, told me it could take decades before Americans learn the real facts of the Russia investigation. For starters, if the intelligence community laid out every detail of proof it has of Russia collusion, it could hamper the current investigation and even lead to the loss of life.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you divulge that information, you run the risk of divulging sources and collecting methods, and you want to still continue to be able to collect [information],\u201d Grant, who is African American and tracked Russian targets in the U.S. for four years, told me. \u201cThat information is probably held by a small number of individuals or possibly one individual. If that information gets out, Russia, as you know, has a way of dealing with spies and folks who they think are giving up information.\u201d\n\nA recent example of the FBI\u2019s surveillance of black people dates back to the years after 9/11, when, Vice reported, the bureau identified Ayyub Abdul-Alim as a possible informant who could spy on members of the Mosque of the Islamic Brotherhood in Harlem, which was connected to the black nationalist movement during the 1960s. Somehow, the FBI drew a connection between black nationalism and al-Qaida, Michael German, a fellow with the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University and a former FBI special agent specializing in terrorism, told Vice earlier this year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe [FBI] files suggest that Muslims with family connections to black nationalist groups of the 1960s and 1970s were, after 9/11, viewed as suspicious, as part of the heightened focus on international terrorism and al-Qaida,\u201d German said.\n\nAbdul-Alim is serving a four- to six-year sentence for illegal-gun-possession charges. He believes that the charges are connected to his refusal to become an FBI informant.\n\nOf course, the Russia investigation is a different can of worms. But the case of Abdul-Alim is another example of how our federal agencies have tried to draw conclusions that simply are not there. There was no proof of criminal activity at the Mosque of the Islamic Brotherhood, but the possibility of criminality was strongly considered after Sept. 11.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI asked Grant, the FBI and DIA officer, if he was ever asked to spy on black organizations. He said, \u201cNo.\u201d (I get it. He would not admit to such actions anyway, but I had to ask.) But he did tell me that he was very aware of the history of modern-day intelligence and law-enforcement agencies like the FBI and how some black people may be resistant to trusting the bureau\u2019s judgment on Russian collusion.\n\n\n\nIn the end, he feels it is important that people remember that the Kremlin\u2019s actions hurt every American, regardless of race. An attack against America\u2019s electoral process is one of the toughest blows one can inflict. Grant also feels confident that the DIA and FBI he joined in the 2000s aren\u2019t the same as their forebears of the 1960s.\n\nBut if you still have reservations about the investigation, given the intelligence community\u2019s history, Grant understands.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFolks have a right to be skeptical,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re not skeptical, then something is wrong with you.\u201d", "keywords": ["proof", "targeting", "intelligence", "history", "grant", "given", "fbis", "investigation", "russia", "fbi", "russian", "told", "folks", "black", "communities", "trust"], "polarity": 0.0165030850375678, "subjectivity": 0.36226489028213166},

According to a scathing bit of news from Vanity Fair, not only is Kelly\u2019s time coming to an end, but Ivanka is already looking for his replacement.\n\nHere\u2019s how Vanity Fair breaks it down:\n\nTwo prominent Republicans in frequent contact with the White House told me that Trump has discussed choosing Kelly\u2019s successor in recent days, asking a close friend what he thought about David Urban, a veteran Washington lobbyist and political operative who helped engineer Trump\u2019s victory in Pennsylvania. Ivanka is also playing a central role in the search, quietly field-testing ideas with people. \u201cIvanka is the most worried about it. She\u2019s trying to figure who replaces Kelly,\u201d a person who\u2019s spoken with her said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the magazine, the only reason Kelly hasn\u2019t been tossed out of the White House like Uncle Phil used to do Jazzy Jeff is that Trump knows that firing another senior staff member would do nothing but bring more trouble to his wobbly tenure.\n\nSources told Vanity Fair that Kelly doesn\u2019t want to be in the White House anymore and is only holding on to stay longer than Reince Priebus, the former White House chief of staff.\n\nThe seam started to split between Kelly and Trump after Kelly did an interview noting that the president\u2019s position had evolved since campaigning for office. The president was reportedly furious that Kelly would leak that truth on national television, since anyone with working ears and a decent set of eyes knows that his positions have moved more than an air hockey puck. Shortly after Kelly\u2019s interview, Trump took to Twitter, as he\u2019s been known to do, tweeting: \u201cThe Wall is the Wall, it has never changed or evolved from the first day I conceived of it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut who didn\u2019t see all of this coming? In fact, many people were surprised that Kelly, a four-star Marine general, who was highly respected, would agree to work with a president who\u2019s been a hot button and arguably on the wrong side of history since running for office.\n\nKelly has been credited with streamlining who has access to the president and was instrumental in kicking hangers-on Omarosa Manigault Newman and Steve Bannon out of the White House. But Trump can\u2019t stand it when someone else is seen as the adult to his petulant-child antics, so of course this was never going to work out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe more Kelly plays up that he\u2019s being the adult in the room\u2014that it\u2019s basically combat duty and he\u2019s serving the country\u2014that kind of thing drives Trump nuts,\u201d a Republican close to the White House told Vanity Fair.\n\nIn recent days, Trump has fumed to friends that Kelly acts like he\u2019s running the government while Trump tweets and watches television.\n\nAlso, Trump reportedly told one friend: \u201cI\u2019ve got another nut job here who thinks he\u2019s running things,\u201d referring to Kelly, Vanity Fair reports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, the White House will tell you that this is more fake news and that there\u2019s nothing wrong between Kelly and Trump. In fact, that\u2019s exactly what the White House did.\n\nA White House official told Vanity Fair: \u201cIt\u2019s categorically false that Trump is unhappy with Kelly. He\u2019s only ever referred to him as the general, tough, can be rough, and commands respect.\u201d\n\nAt this point, I don\u2019t believe anything that comes out of the White House.

Mitchell, who had spent his childhood listening to family stories, said he was related to the legendary Oscar James Dunn. But according to Mitchell, his teacher had no idea who that was. \u201cHe\u2019s the first black Lieutenant Governor, not just for Louisiana, but for the entire nation,\u201d Mitchell remembers saying. \u201cThere\u2019s never been a black lieutenant governor of Louisiana,\u201d his teacher replied.\n\n\n\nBut there was, and he was Mitchell\u2019s great great great-uncle. \u201cAs I child, I\u2019d spend my days after school with my great-grandmother,\u201d Mitchell recalls. And her family stories \u201calways sort of lead to important patriarchs or matriarchs,\u201d including Dunn. Now Mitchell is an assistant professor of history at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, and he\u2019s spent much of his career studying Dunn so future teachers don\u2019t make the same mistake his did some four decades ago.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s never been a black lieutenant governor of Louisiana,\u201d his teacher said.\n\nAs New Orleans has been in the national spotlight over the removal of four city monuments\u2014all erected after the end of Reconstruction, years after the Civil War, to reassert white power\u2014Mitchell is bringing attention to a monument of is ancestor that was intended to be built. It was supposed to honor Reconstruction\u2019s success, and it featured a prominent black politician named Oscar James Dunn, who during his relatively short life wrestled with white politicians over civil rights.\n\n\n\nDunn was supposed to be a hero: Around the time he suffered an untimely and mysterious death, a journalist wrote, \u201cThere will be three pictures that hang in the home of every African-American \u2026 Abraham Lincoln, Frederick Douglass, and Oscar James Dunn.\u201d Thanks to some historical amnesia, and a smear campaign against Dunn, that didn\u2019t end up being true.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDunn was born in New Orleans around 1822 to an enslaved mother. She fell in love with a free man of color named James who bought her and her two children for $800 in 1831. By the time Oscar James Dunn turned 11, he was free: \u201cThat changes Dunn\u2019s life forever,\u201d Mitchell says. Now the young Dunn could go to school\u2014and he was good at school. He learned a trade (plastering) and he was excellent at that, too. Dunn grew up to become the head of the black Masonic Lodges in Louisiana, a powerful civic force working on education and youth initiatives for free blacks in the state. Then the Civil War ended, and the Reconstruction era began.\n\nAround this time, \u201cAfrican-Americans are all over the South,\u201d Mitchell says. \u201cThey\u2019re released and people need their labor for agriculture.\u201d Dunn opened an office to cater to their needs, and used his education to write contracts for recently released enslaved people, so they could work on plantations without being cheated.\n\nDunn made sure these newly free people actually got paid for their labor, and he was quite good at that, too\u2014which inspired those close to him to suggest he might make a good politician. Around that time, people of color freed prior to the Emancipation Proclamation (like Dunn) were beginning to enter politics. Dunn ran for office: he was elected to be Louisiana\u2019s Lieutenant governor in 1868.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDunn was a member of what was known as the Radical Republican party. \u201cThey were the progressive party that was trying to extend civil rights to African Americans, especially in the South,\u201d says Nick Weldon, who works for the Historic New Orleans Collection, a museum and research center. Weldon discovered Dunn\u2019s history as he was going through some of his historical documents. He recently found quotes from the New Orleans Times where local Democrats described Dunn, their political opponent, and the \u201cthe taint of honesty and of scrupulous regard for the official properties,\u201d which was a \u201cserious drawback in innervating a reproach on the lieutenant governor.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe did a lot against a lot of pressure, and in a pretty hostile environment.\u201d\n\n\u201cBasically, they\u2019re like, he is so fair-minded and scrupulous that it\u2019s annoying,\u201d Weldon says.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDunn used such bipartisan respect to advance his career: \u201cHe became a big proponent for universal male suffrage\u201d as well as civil rights legislation and the integration of public schools, according to Weldon. \u201cHe did a lot against a lot of pressure, and in a pretty hostile environment.\u201d\n\n\u201cHostile\u201d is one way to put it. The Louisiana governor at the time was a man named Henry Warmoth, a white, 20-something Republican from New York. Three years after the Civil War ended, in 1868, he and Dunn were elected on the same ticket. Dunn was two decades older than Governor Warmoth, and at first Dunn believed, perhaps naively, that this young Yankee wanted equality between white Louisianans and their black counterparts. But then Governor Warmoth betrayed Lieutenant Governor Dunn.\n\n\u201cWhen it actually came time for him to sign a bill that would protect blacks,\u201d Brian Mitchell says, \u201che says no.\u201d The governor vetoed a bill that would have penalized bus and business owners who did not provide equal services to both races.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Governor Warmoth refused to sign this civil rights bill, it divided the Republican party. Despite the fact that that both Dunn and Warmoth were members of the same party, they found themselves in direct competition over the most explosive issues of the time. There was a Dunn camp and a Warmoth camp at the time; they had separate police forces, seperate conventions.\n\n\u201cIt was complete chaos,\u201d Weldon says. \u201cThere was no order.\u201d\n\nWarmoth began to lose power. The Democrats, once Souther Confederates, didn\u2019t accept Governor Warmoth because they saw him as a \u201ccarpetbagger,\u201d a foreign leader with little local interest. The Radical Republicans, and in particular the black members of the party, realized quickly that Governor Warmoth was working against their interests. By 1872 another gubernatorial election was on the horizon, and there was talk amongst these factions of impeaching Warmoth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, Dunn\u2019s career was going well\u2014and if Warmoth were to be impeached, he would become the first black governor in the country. Rumors started flying around the state that that the president of the United States, Ulysses S. Grant, was considering Dunn as his vice president after Dunn visited the capitol. And then, in November of 1871, Dunn went to a public dinner. Two days later, he was dead.\n\nAnd then, in November of 1871, Dunn went to a public dinner. Two days later, he was dead.\n\nAccording Mitchell, Dunn fell violently ill soon after attending the dinner, vomiting, shivering, and falling unconscious. He called a few close friends, says Mitchell, but there wasn\u2019t much they could do. \u201cAnd there is speculation that he may have been, as they say, \u2018dosed\u2019\u201d with poison.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNick Weldon says Dunn\u2019s death was a \u201cshock to the city.\u201d The official cause of death: congestion of the brain and lungs, technically classified as natural causes. But many people, Weldon included, say Dunn\u2019s symptoms were consistent with arsenic poisoning. And four out of the seven doctors who examined the lieutenant governor refused to sign off on the official cause of death.\n\nBut, says, Mitchell, \u201cwe really just don\u2019t know what happened to Dunn.\u201d His immediate family refused an autopsy, so we\u2019ll never know whether he was poisoned by political rivals. It remains something of a historical mystery. \u201cThere have probably been more papers on Dunn\u2019s death than on Dunn\u2019s life,\u201d Mitchell notes.\n\nDunn died at the age of 49, at the height of his political career. The city was in shock. \u201cOver 50,000 people turned out for the funeral. It\u2019s called the largest in New Orleans\u2019 history,\u201d Mitchell says. \u201cThe composition of the crowd was made up of every facet of New Orleans society, black and white. And I always point out that it\u2019s probably one of the oldest second lines in New Orleans history. There are jazz bands that are there.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe mourners included most of Dunn\u2019s political rivals\u2014the men who could have poisoned him. Governor Warmoth, of all people, was a pallbearer. The second line stretched a mile long, from the intersection of Claiborne and Canal (where Dunn\u2019s house is) to Magazine street. It proceeded to the cemetery. \u201cTo say he was well loved in the city would have been an understatement,\u201d Mitchell says.\n\nBut that regard was never memorialized the way white Confederate heroes were. Weldon says $10,000 was dedicated to create a monument of Dunn in an act signed by the governor\u2014a couple hundred thousand, in today\u2019s money\u2014but it was never spent. Today, we don\u2019t even really know why. \u201cAll I know is that it isn\u2019t there,\u201d Mitchell says.\n\nBut he has found evidence of a movement to discredit Dunn: an old drawing from that era of a Mardi Gras ball, where the Krewe of Comus dressed their king up as an ape to mock the lieutenant governor. \u201cI argue,\u201d says Mitchell, \u201cthat it\u2019s at this point that revisionists start trying to take over the narrative and rewrite Dunn as a villain instead of a hero in American history.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBy taking down Dunn, they were able to reinforce notions of black inferiority in Louisiana.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you see this somewhat rising African-American political star at the time of all this strife \u2026 The guy dies and pretty much with him was all the gains that he had fought for: Civil rights, suffrage, integration in public schools,\u201d Weldon says.\n\n\n\n\u201cReconstruction started to go away after that. At the same time, the Ku Klux Klan is just getting started. The White League is just getting started,\u201d Weldon says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBy taking down Dunn, they were able to reinforce notions of black inferiority in Louisiana,\u201d Mitchell points out.\n\nSo two decades after Dunn died, instead of building a monument for a formerly enslaved man who could have become the vice president, a monument goes up in Liberty Place to honor a white supremacist group, the Crescent City white League.\n\n\u201cAll of this progress that was made gets immediately wiped off the slate,\u201d Weldon says. But a hundred years later, Dunn\u2019s descendant, Brian Mitchell, goes to elementary school in New Orleans, where his teacher tells him his ancestor never existed. \u201cMy entire life I went to classes, and I loved history. And I heard about Manifest Destiny and I heard about the melting pot, and none of these things seem to explain my condition as an African-American in the United States,\u201d he says. \u201cBut Dunn did.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn our conversation, I asked Mitchell if he thought the scrapped monument to Dunn would have made a difference in how well-known the politician was. \u201cMost certainly,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nThis feature is part of Splinter\u2019s project to recruit local, embedded reporters, essayists, and photographers across the country.

Rockford is one of those cities where people get married and start families at an age when they still need a co-signer to rent an Enterprise vehicle\u2014not exactly fertile dating ground for a 20-something black professional. So immediately following that breakup, I turned to the internet to meet women who lived an hour southeast in Chicago.\n\nI met a handful of women on Myspace before it was overrun by bots posing as strippers, and I signed up to Match for the first time. I\u2019ve dated online since then, with the only protracted break being the five-and-a-half years I was with my former wife (whom I actually met on Match; believe the commercials when they tell you it sends some niggas over that broom). I was terrified to approach women in person until I was in my early 20s, but I\u2019ve always been able to convey my personality through writing, so meeting people online was a good fit.\n\nThe stigma of online dating was different when I started\u2014smartphones and dating apps weren\u2019t yet a thing, and many women were understandably concerned that dating online would get them ax-murdered by some schmuck resembling the bad guy from Last Action Hero. In recent years, it\u2019s become more widely accepted that regular people are seeking other regular people online instead of hoping that the love of their life finds them in the kumquat section of their local grocery store.\n\nHowever, I learned quickly that we black folks have our own unique challenges through which to traverse in dating online. We encounter many of the same issues we do when dating while black \u201cconventionally\u201d\u2014chief among them racism, limited options and self-haters who don\u2019t want to date you because you resemble them. Plus, anecdotal information and conversations I\u2019ve had with black men and women lead me to believe that we\u2019re still a bit more skeptical about meeting a good partner online.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you\u2019re in that camp, allow me to disabuse you of the notion that online dating isn\u2019t meant for \u201cus\u201d; it demands patience and time, but it\u2019s a great method of proactivity for those of us who\u2019d rather not wait for God to \u201cplace\u201d someone in our lives.\n\nIt also helps to understand that not all online dating services are built equally for us, so I\u2019m here to help. I\u2019ve paid for and used several of the services designed for computers, as well as the more popular location-based smartphone apps. I live in Chicago\u2014whose metropolitan area contains millions of black folks\u2014and fired up the apps in black cities I visited recently (New York, Baltimore, D.C., Detroit). I rated the apps between 1 and 5 based on their ability to find you black love (or booty) if you reside in a black enclave, with 5 being your best bet and 1 meaning you\u2019re probably better off giving the nigga with the S curl and kissy-lips neck tattoo that your auntie recommended from her job a shot.\n\n(Note: This list is certainly not comprehensive because there are, like, 24,502, 850,462,404 online dating apps. Most of them have trash interfaces and not nearly enough users to matter.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMatch\n\nStill the gold standard. Match has been around the longest and has the biggest user base, so chances are the hapless bastard who\u2019s tired of buying women watered-down amaretto sours at the bar will have acquiesced to one of Match\u2019s three-month membership ads. Sending messages requires a paid membership, which tends to bring more serious people to the yard. If your city has a lot of black folks, you\u2019ll find a lot of options on Match, and likely a good representation of your city: I created a search for black women ages 24 to 40 in Atlanta and fell in love about 27 times before I left the second page. Rating: 5\n\nOKCupid\n\nSimilar to Match but with a few more bells and whistles to ostensibly get you closer to your boo thang; black folks play heavily on OKCupid. Unlike Match, however, you can message people for free, which means fielding a bunch of people who might not take it as seriously as you do. Paying members can, among other things, tailor their search to attractiveness, segmented into \u201caverage,\u201d \u201cabove average\u201d and \u201chot.\u201d Placing the meter on \u201chot\u201d definitely produced some bad sistas, but so did the \u201caverage\u201d settings. Which is likely proof that \u201cwe\u201d aren\u2019t the ones rating our attractiveness. Rating: 4\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTinder\n\nTinder came out after I met my wife-to-be, so I didn\u2019t give it a spin until after my divorce. Sure enough, there\u2019s no better place to rebound than a dating app whose reputation as a hookup shop precedes it. Even if you write, \u201cI\u2019m not here to hook up,\u201d some dude will let you know in graphic detail what he wants to do with your feet. Of the location-based \u201cswipe\u201d apps, Tinder is the most popular, with about 50 million users, so if you live around black folks, you\u2019ll find them here. Beware, though\u2014I\u2019ve never seen so many damn prevarications on a program that prides itself on pure superficiality. Do yourself a favor and research before a meet to make sure they aren\u2019t trying to pass off pictures of themselves from George W.\u2019s second term. Rating: 3\n\nPlenty of Fish\n\nPoF is the hood of online dating. It\u2019s that gas station that sells the sticky buns you like but you won\u2019t go to after a certain hour because of the risk of encountering some bullshit. If you don\u2019t mind getting picked up in a teal 2003 Chevy Impala with a Sally Beauty Supply mirror duct-taped to the missing side-view mirror, this is your app. Like OKCupid, Plenty of Fish is free to use, except it\u2019s that Popeyes biscuits-they-give-away-before-closing type of free. You can do better. Rating: 2\n\nAdvertisement\n\neHarmony\n\nY\u2019know what \u2026 ? Fuck eHarmony. Several dating sites use psychology-based algorithms as part of their matchmaking process, but that\u2019s eHarmony\u2019s whole business. They\u2019re like parents who arrange your marriage, but the only things they know about you are from an online survey you filled out. The one time I used eHarmony, I narrowed my search to black and Latina women and got precisely zero matches\u2014in Chicago, a city where those demos combined is close to a million people. eHarmony is also the Chick-fil-A of dating sites\u2014it refuses to open its virtual doors to you blaspheming gays or \u201cstrange\u201d gender-nonbinary folks. On top of all that, it\u2019s the most expensive mainstream dating site, at motherfucking $60 a month! Save your coins. Rating: 1\n\nBumble\n\nThe swipe mechanics are the same as Tinder\u2019s, but the woman has to initiate contact upon matching. In every city I visited, using Bumble produced the whitest results ever. It\u2019s as if every woman who wears Uggs over leggings, outfits her Yorkie in a bubble vest during the winter and swears by pumpkin spice everything all descended on the same app. I met and dated exactly one black woman from Bumble, which felt like encountering a black person in downtown Eau Claire, Wis. Rating: 2\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCoffee Meets Bagel\n\nI was pleasantly surprised when giving this a whirl. I found more black folks on it than most other smartphone-based apps, and it\u2019s not designed for hookups, like most of its competitors. You must pay for its premium features ($35 per month), and I\u2019m not a fan of the corny nomenclature (\u201cMeet your everything bagel,\u201d etc.), but I see it growing to become a viable alternative to the Tinders of the world. Bonus points to the founding sisters for turning down a hypothetical $30 million for the app from Mark Cuban on Shark Tank. Rating: 3.5\n\nHappn\n\nYeah, see \u2026 Happn is how people get robbed and shit. The app uses GPS to connect people based on their recent physical proximity to each other, identifying where they crossed paths on a map by a matter of feet. I saw very few black people on the app, and for good reason: We\u2019re way too averse to submitting to Big Brother to that degree. Like I want my potential partner knowing out the gate how often I go to Buffalo Wild Wings. Rating: 1.5\n\nAdvertisement\n\nZoosk\n\nBruh. For the love of Jehoshaphat, keep away from Zoosk. If Plenty of Fish is the hood of online dating, Zoosk is the county jail cell on a Saturday night. Don\u2019t try Zoosk. Trust me. You might as well light your $30 membership money on fire.

When it was revealed that both the FBI and White House officials knew about the allegations against both men, it raised questions as to why they were allowed to keep their jobs and whether or not this administration enables abusers.\n\nIn a White House press briefing Monday afternoon, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders asserted that the White House takes the allegations \u201cvery seriously\u201d and believes that they should be \u201cinvestigated thoroughly.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe president and the entire administration take domestic violence very seriously and believe all allegations need to be investigated thoroughly. Above all, the president supports victims of domestic violence and believes everyone should be treated fairly and with due process.

And you have to listen to him also.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFurthermore, the president himself has been accused 19 times of sexual harassment and sexual abuse\u2014claims that he and the White House have labeled \u201cfake news.\u201d His administration\u2019s policies do not show any amount of care for women who are victims, either. In fact, before he even took office, his team proposed eliminating the Justice Department\u2019s violence-against-women grant programs that allocate funds to organizations that deal with sexual assault and domestic abuse.\n\nAs a woman, I\u2019m not sure how Suckabee reconciles her staunch defense of the president and his bullshit in the wake of the #MeToo movement. That she could stand at that podium and give that bullshit-ass statement is sickening. She knows what her boss has said publicly (more than once!) when it comes to accused abusers, and she continues to defend him anyway. It\u2019s gross.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s obvious the president doesn\u2019t care about victims of domestic violence.

Obama\u2019s soaring speech, followed by Springsteen\u2019s song, offered a momentary respite from the grief, dread and shock many Americans experienced after the election of Donald Trump.\n\nAs the night came to a close and Michelle and Barack Obama walked off the stage hand in hand, one era was ending and another was coming into sharper view. Obama\u2019s and Springsteen\u2019s messages blended together to reassure listeners that everything would be all right: \u201cLeave behind your sorrows/Let this day be the last/Tomorrow there\u2019ll be sunshine/And all this darkness past.\u201d\n\nOne year after Trump\u2019s inauguration, a majority of Americans know that everything is not all right. The darkness that Springsteen sang about has not passed. Instead, it has surrounded and battered us on a daily, sometimes hourly, basis. Just when we think things can\u2019t get any worse, news breaks of another ill-informed, inappropriate and unpresidential tweet.\n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s lead role in escalating tensions between the United States and North Korea created mass hysteria in Hawaii when an emergency message was sent in error about a ballistic missile threat. Hawaiians and tourists ran to seek shelter and wrote frantic goodbyes via text message to their loved ones. Pick your nightmare. Anything is possible\u2014even nuclear holocaust\u2014with Trump as president.\n\nWe have serious cause to question whether our democratic principles will endure. Let\u2019s face the facts: The president of the United States is a racist, a xenophobe, a sexual predator, a chauvinist, and a thin-skinned and small-minded man who lacks empathy, morality and competence. He knows too little history to recognize that he is on the wrong side of it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is not only naive but it is dangerous to excuse Trump\u2019s words and actions with a wave of the hand and an assertion, as House Speaker Paul Ryan made after \u201ccandid conversations\u201d with Trump, that \u201chis heart is in the right place.\u201d\n\nIt is equally wrongheaded to claim that we could not have known that Trump would disparage women and people of color as viciously as he has. Recall Trump\u2019s comments before the election about grabbing women\u2019s genitalia or his view that Mexico was sending \u201ccriminals\u201d and \u201crapists\u201d to America. Indeed, Trump catapulted himself into the political arena by ruthlessly questioning the citizenship status and the birth certificate of the country\u2019s first black president.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s racist deeds did not begin with his run for president or his decision to absolve neo-Nazis and white supremacists in Charlottesville, Va., for their hateful acts this summer. For the last 40 years, Trump has actively engaged in stoking this country\u2019s racist fires.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Justice Department sued Trump in 1973 for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in some of his housing developments to African Americans. In 1989 Trump spent $85,000 on full-page advertisements in New York City newspapers that called for the death penalty for the African-American and Latino teenagers who were wrongly accused of raping a white woman in the city\u2019s Central Park.\n\nAmericans knew who they were voting for, and still, they elected Trump.\n\nIf Trump has his way, America will no longer be a place where countless success stories of immigrants and the sons and daughters of immigrants are possible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the past two years, Trump has dishonored the day that celebrates the life of Martin Luther King Jr. While former presidents\u2014Republicans and Democrats alike\u2014have honored the wishes of the King family and participated in a day of service, this year, Trump played golf.\n\nLast year, during the weekend of the King holiday, Trump mischaracterized the district of civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) as \u201cfalling apart (not to mention crime-infested)\u201d and \u201cin horrible shape.\u201d This was yet another example of Trump\u2019s ignorance: The district, which includes parts of Atlanta and its suburbs, is, in fact, a prosperous hub of tech companies and colleges.\n\nAs the 50th anniversary of King\u2019s assassination approaches this April, we must steel ourselves for more unpresidential behavior, as we have no reason to expect anything else.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump\u2019s comments about \u201cshithole countries\u201d should come as no surprise to those who are familiar with his long history of racism and who have followed his rise to power. But what makes these comments so disturbing is not whether they prove that Trump is a racist. We already knew that. His comments erode American values.\n\n\n\nA poll released Thursday showed a free fall in other nations\u2019 approval of American leadership, with such approval down 18 points to a historical low of 30 percent. The United States lags behind Germany and China and ranks just slightly ahead of Russia. Recall that on the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly boasted that he would restore the respect that Obama had supposedly lost while in office.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBruce Springsteen\u2019s song underscores American ideals and uses the image of a train as a powerful metaphor for America as a nation of immigrants. Springsteen calls for a motley group of passengers to board a train and meet him in the \u201cland of hope and dreams.\u201d This train, we are told, carries \u201csaints and sinners,\u201d \u201closers and winners,\u201d \u201cwhores and gamblers,\u201d \u201clost souls,\u201d the \u201cbrokenhearted,\u201d \u201cthieves and sweet souls departed,\u201d and \u201cfools and kings.\u201d These passengers do not need tickets, Springsteen explains; all they have to do is \u201cjust get on board.\u201d\n\nOne could argue that throughout his presidency, Obama told people in the United States and around the world that in America, a singular opportunity existed to take a seat on the train that Springsteen describes. Obama reminded us that \u201cin no other country on earth is [his] story even possible.\u201d The son of a Kenyan immigrant, a black man named Barack Hussein Obama had ascended to the highest office in the United States.\n\nIf Trump has his way, America will no longer be a place where countless success stories of immigrants and the sons and daughters of immigrants are possible. America will be a fundamentally different country. We have already seen parents separated from their children and deported after living in the United States for 30 years. The lives of 800,000 \u201cDreamers\u201d continue to hang in the balance after Trump ended the Obama administration\u2019s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program in September.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf we give up on the hard work of maintaining a vibrant and diverse democracy and if we stop striving to become a \u201cmore perfect union,\u201d we will become more isolated and more diminished in the eyes of the world than we are now. We have always fallen short of our ideals, but the current occupant of the White House appears woefully ignorant of what those ideals are.\n\n\n\nTrump sorely needs a history lesson to learn about the untold contributions of immigrants who built this country and risked their lives to defend it. Trump has no curiosity or knowledge about the realities of the lives of Haitian immigrants, who he believes \u201call have AIDS.\u201d Nor does he understand Haiti\u2019s historic achievement of becoming the world\u2019s first black republic in 1804.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe fails to grasp the consequences of military interventions, imperialism and economic exploitation that Haiti has faced. He believes that Nigerians live in \u201chuts\u201d and remains unaware that according to the U.S. census, Nigerian immigrants eclipse both whites and Asians and have the highest levels of education in the country.\n\nIt will be a herculean, if not impossible, task to disabuse Trump of the numerous stereotypes, unsophisticated thoughts and outright incorrect ideas that he holds.\n\nOne wonders if Trump knows that Founding Father and fellow New Yorker Alexander Hamilton was an immigrant born to unmarried parents on the West Indian island of Nevis. Hamilton, who created a national bank and would become the first secretary of the treasury, moved with his mother to St. Croix, which was devastated by a hurricane in 1772. He eventually made it to New York after impressing local businessmen who raised money for his passage upon reading his eloquent report about the hurricane in a local newspaper.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe preservation of American values and principles requires the courage and constant vigilance of political officials\u2014Republican and Democrat\u2014and everyday citizens. The \u201cland of hope and dreams\u201d that Bruce Springsteen sang of is not guaranteed to last forever.", "keywords": ["springsteen", "states", "america", "soul", "train", "losing", "immigrants", "obama", "united", "trump", "trumps", "springsteens"], "polarity": 0.011970418470418466, "subjectivity": 0.4373466810966811},

During a conversation on the June 28 edition of Premiere Radio Network\u2019s The Sean Hannity Show, the conservative kook lamented about how unfair various users of Tinder, Bumble and other online dating apps are being for sending all of his orange homeboys\u2019 supporters to the left (yes, I hear Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s voice now, too, beloved).\n\nThe exchange, courtesy of Media Matters, went as follows:\n\n\n\nSEAN HANNITY (HOST): Alright so I don\u2019t know if you have the same thing, what do they call this matchmaking thing, timber and all that other stuff that they got? Tinder and all that other stuff? KATIE HOPKINS: Yeah, we have that. HANNITY: OK so there apparently Donald Trump according to the Sacramento Bee is saying people will ask straight up do you vote for or do you support Trump. And if you did boom, that\u2019s it. HOPKINS: You\u2019re off. HANNITY: You\u2019re off. Trump voters please swipe left and go to your room and think about what you have done on Tinder. I mean where is this hatred coming from? Salon had to take a Trump free Tuesday day today because they\u2019re so unhinged over there. What\u2019s going on? HOPKINS: Well I mean first things first, Mr. Hannity, I think you and I and the rest of the population should always be very cautious of anybody that meets their date online. Like if you have to form a relationship online it probably means that in real life you\u2019re a bit of a prat and nobody wants to hang out with you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhere is the hatred coming from?\n\nI was always encouraged to avoid asking dumb-ass questions; pity that Hannity was never #Blessed with that nugget of valuable intel. For fellow fools with similar inquiries, seek counsel from a Mexican, a Muslim, one of \u201cthe blacks,\u201d or any woman who both bleeds and has no issue with questioning Bankruptcy Batista. Shoutout to Mika Brzezinski.\n\nMeanwhile, anyone who still questions online dating is a dial-up dummy who needs to get with us broadband baddies. That said, consider the source of such accusations\u2014that folks who date online are social pariahs who can\u2019t function in real life. Folks like Hannity cater to an audience who miss the days of segregated water fountains, so it\u2019s impossible for them to understand how \u201cTimber\u201d works.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe article that riled \u2019em up is titled \u201cHow Donald Trump Is Killing Romance.\u201d In it, writer Angela Hart explores how our current political climate\u2014so nasty, so rude\u2014has impacted those online looking to get some good lovin\u2019, body rockin\u2019, knockin\u2019 boots all night long (yeah).

It\u2019s another example of how massively our dating culture has changed over the past four years, partly because of politics and also because of technology.\u201d Tinder allows people 500 characters to write their profiles. For Bumble, it\u2019s only 300. Since January, many are using that limited space to make it public how much they detest Donald Trump .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn my Tinder profile, I mention that I don\u2019t trust anyone who doesn\u2019t like Beyonc\u00e9. I\u2019ve tried to date Beytheists before, but it\u2019s a fool\u2019s errand. When seeking companionship, you have to find those who align with you spiritually and, yes, politically. Evidently, quite a few folks are only now realizing how important it is not to date anyone who supports someone with the political ideology of a Twitter egg, Klansman or suburbanite complicit in demagoguery.\n\nHart goes on to write:\n\nThe site\u2019s data also underscores what dating experts are seeing: 60 percent of singles say they are less open to dating across party lines than two years ago. It\u2019s more stark among liberals. Conservatives are 57 percent more likely to date across party lines. But if you voted for Trump last election, you may have limited your dating pool. Match found that 91 percent of liberals say they judge potential dates negatively for having voted for Trump, and more than half said they\u2019re more likely to ask about their political views since the election. \u201cPeople are so divided in our country right now that they don\u2019t even want to start a relationship with someone who they don\u2019t agree with politically. I\u2019ve never seen it like this, ever,\u201d Spira said. \u201cBeing on the same political page is more important to singles now than it has ever been in history. It used to be that dating a smoker was a top deal-breaker. That\u2019s been replaced with politics.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI don\u2019t know what planet a lot of you folks were living on, but welcome to the rational side of life. For the life of me, I\u2019ll never understand why it took a 71-year-old man-baby, audacious bigot and overall ignoramus to get many to see what\u2019s already been there. But better late than never, folks.\n\nDo not date people with political views that will drive you mad. There is no middle ground between respecting black lives and not giving a damn about state-sanctioned violence against black women, men and children. There is no accord that can be reached between respecting a woman\u2019s autonomy and thinking Planned Parenthood is a baby-killing factory. No way in hell can you find peace with someone who voted for Peachy Pol Pot.\n\nSean Hannity may feel otherwise, but does anyone really want relationship advice from someone who is so far up 45\u2019s ass that he can smell the bullshit at least 45 minutes before it shows up on our morning Twitter feeds?", "keywords": ["tinder", "political", "sean", "relationship", "dont", "supporters", "cant", "dating", "hannity", "accept", "voted", "online", "date", "trump", "sex"], "polarity": 0.02842938311688312, "subjectivity": 0.46251014610389607},

I was in the Post newsroom when Jayson Blair was pushing out fake pieces for the New York Times about the Washington, D.C., sniper, and Post brass were going nuts believing that an out-of-town reporter was beating them in their own backyard.\n\nIt was Post reporters and editors who steadied the ship and assured the higher-ups that the stories Blair was producing weren\u2019t where their reporting was leading them. Those reporters and editors worked long hours, stayed later and came in on days off to make sure that everything put into print was right.\n\n\n\nSince taking office, President Donald Trump has been tireless in his attack on the media. He\u2019s called the media and the stories they\u2019ve produced \u201cfake media\u201d and claimed to be \u201cfailing\u201d any news outlet that pens a piece he doesn\u2019t find flattering about him or his administration. I can\u2019t speak for all journalists, but I can say that the people I know at the Washington Post and the institution itself don\u2019t take kindly to this presidential bashing of who they are and what they represent. To date, the Post is the only newspaper in the country that has taken down a president, and I can assure you that those reporters covering the White House would love nothing more than to do it again.\n\nLate Thursday, the Post released a scathing report that not only are Trump and his team trying to undercut special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation, but they are also literally Googling for whom Trump can issue pardons and how.\n\nI\u2019m not sure how The Root got this photo, but we have actual footage of Trump Googling \u201cpardons\u201d:\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Washington Post story notes that Mueller is looking deep into the Russia rabbit hole and wants all of it: Trump\u2019s taxes, Trump\u2019s business associates, his dealings with and in Russia.

Like a spouse who\u2019s been cheated on, non-Trump Americans know full well when something doesn\u2019t smell right. We know that when Trump started staying late after work and trying to lose weight, he was dating Russia. We know that when Trump got a second credit card that didn\u2019t have our name on it, he was meeting Russia at a hotel downtown. We know what cheating looks like.\n\nBut make no mistake about it: Trump has brought this on himself with his boisterous tweets and his \u201cI don\u2019t have a care\u201d attitude. The walls are closing in on this wasted administration, and hopefully we can get this marriage annulled because we haven\u2019t been together that long.

Four months later, in July, his father is alleged to have begun an affair with Stormy Daniels after meeting her at a golf tournament in Nevada.\n\nSo much for that supposed \u201cloyalty.\u201d I guess much like his being a \u201cstable genius,\u201d it\u2019s just a figment of his imagination.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn that same interview, Trump told Stern that he had seen \u201cbeautiful women that for the rest of their lives have become a horror\u201d after giving birth.\n\n\u201cYou know, they gain, like, 250 pounds,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a disaster.\u201d\n\nHe had all of that to say when he has put on significant weight and looks the way he does? OK. I guess he doesn\u2019t hold the same standards for himself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then there\u2019s this quote from New York Post columnist Andrea Peyser, who visited the Trumps about two months after Melania gave birth to Barron:\n\nWhen I visited about two months after his lovely wife, Melania, now 46, gave birth to the couple\u2019s son, Barron, now 10, the infamous germaphobe boasted that after fathering five children, he\u2019d never changed a diaper. I enthused that Melania, who stood quietly nearby aboard 5-inch stilettos, had lost all her baby weight.

It has nothing to do with my dislike for you or your people. In fact, some of my best friends are white. Well ... one of my best friends is white. OK, I\u2019ll be honest, all of my best friends are black, but one of them is kinda light-skinned, and when I was in the 11th grade, I went to a New Edition concert with three Caucasian classmates, so that should count for something.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut my hesitancy in penning this correspondence is based on another fact: I didn\u2019t believe you were real. I didn\u2019t discount your existence the way I don\u2019t believe in unicorns, good cops or Rihanna. (Yeah, I said it. I believe Rih Rih is a highly advanced, computer-generated image based on our collective fantasies. You might think it\u2019s crazy, but I stand by my research.)\n\nWhen people told me that there were actual individuals upset about the upcoming Marvel movie Black Panther, I thought they were exaggerating or overestimating the number. I suspect there are always a few fringe kooks who share an idiotic ideology.\n\nKyrie Irving and B.o.B think the Earth is flat. Some people believe that Donald Trump is both stable and a genius. And once, on the dance floor of a crowded nightclub, a woman told me I was handsome and cute. (At least that\u2019s what I think she said, although she may have said, \u201cYou\u2019re standing on my foot.\u201d It was pretty crowded and I\u2019d consumed a few beverages. But for the sake of this argument, let\u2019s just say it was the cute thing.) My point here is, sometimes people have wildly diverging opinions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust as I was ready to dismiss the notion that there might be more than a handful of people who disliked the notion of a Black Panther movie before they even saw it, someone sent me a transcript of Rush Limbaugh ranting about liberals embracing Black Panther.\n\nI honestly get why Limbaugh was upset. If I were a half-deaf, impotent walrus who had to sit in front of a microphone yelling to white senior citizens who still listen to AM radio while popping Oxycontin like Tic Tacs during commercial breaks, I\u2019d probably be a little jealous of T\u2019Challa, too. Plus, Limbaugh is racist, and the film does have the words \u201cBlack\u201d and \u201cPanther\u201d in it, so .... there\u2019s that.\n\nBut people kept sending me things. There was a story calling Black Panther \u201cobviously racist,\u201d a Breitbart article that called the comic book \u201cBlack Lives Matter-themed,\u201d and that piece where Ben Shapiro crumpled into a rice-paper-thin ball of fuckboy fragility in a nonsensical monologue about how this is the fault of black people, leftists and, of course, Barack Obama.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, that\u2019s only three racists people.\n\nAnd then, like a fool, I ventured into the land of white nonsense where coffee machines and Bluetooth speakers somehow have all colluded to form a plot to eradicate the great arrhythmic race: Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s Twitter,\u201d I reasoned. White people on Twitter are like the Incredible Hulk when he\u2019s off his meds: They\u2019ll get mad at anything. Then I happened upon this well-reasoned discourse between writer Zack Linly and a random Facebooker:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can understand why some white people are upset. After all, I distinctly recall how upset black people were about Harry Potter, The Lord of the Rings, When Harry Met Sally, Twilight, Terminator and The Passion of the Christ (yes, they literally made a movie about Jesus with no black people!).\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be fair, the above-mentioned movies were not comic book movies. Making a film about a superhero from an all-black place is an egregious offense. Especially since Marvel put so much detail into making sure its other superhero movies had diverse casts.\n\nI recall how the white outrage forced Hollywood into casting a South American actress to play Wonder Woman, since she was from a fictional race of Amazonian warriors. (I didn\u2019t Google it, but I\u2019m pretty sure Gal Gadot is from Brazil or somewhere. If she were Israeli or something, it would mean white people didn\u2019t care about the ethnicity of comic book characters until a black one came around and triggered their racist ... you know what? I\u2019m not even going there. She\u2019s gotta be from South America, or wypipo would look very stupid right now.) We really thank you for making sure they include black actors every time they flash back to Superman\u2019s home planet of Krypton.\n\nPlus, I\u2019m probably making up the white outcry when someone floated the idea that Donald Glover might be the next Superman, or Idris Elba could play James Bond. I probably imagined that wypipo were upset about John Boyega playing a Stormtrooper, just like I dreamed about Rihanna or that woman who thought I was handsome. (I\u2019m pretty sure she said \u201chandsome and cute,\u201d not \u201cstanding on my foot.\u201d I mean ... I was actually standing on her foot, but that\u2019s neither here nor there.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause white people have repeatedly stood up for inclusion and diversity in casting, we would like to admit that this is our fault. Forgive us for being excited that there is finally a movie that caters to our sensibilities without kowtowing to the notion of a white savior.\n\nI tell you what we\u2019ll do. To make this up to you, we promise that we will remain marginalized, mostly ancillary characters in most of the Hollywood blockbusters for the rest of the year. We also swear that we will allow you to win and be nominated for the bulk of Oscars, Golden Globes, Emmys, Tony Awards, Peabody Awards, Billboard Awards, MTV Awards, America\u2019s Got Talent, spelling bees, luge races, school shootings, mass murders, police-shooting trials, Senate races and rose ceremonies on The Bachelor.\n\nI don\u2019t want there to be any hard feelings. I know that white people have so little to celebrate in America that seeing black people smile, if only for one second, could just be the thing that breaks your brittle little racist hearts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSincerely,\n\nYour handsome and cute black friend", "keywords": ["open", "making", "im", "handsome", "upset", "white", "sure", "movie", "panther", "black", "racist", "letter"], "polarity": 0.12658975328878244, "subjectivity": 0.4967231258493393},

He also took issue with the acting FBI director and the deputy attorney general who recommended Comey\u2019s dismissal.\n\nNot only did Trump unironically say that Mueller is running an office full of conflicts of interest, but he also issued a veiled threat and warned investigators against looking into matters that move away from the Russia investigation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(What?! No, really. The irony is making me constipated.)\n\nYour president said, \u201cJeff Sessions takes the job, gets into the job, recuses himself, which frankly I think is very unfair to the president.

Trump obstructed justice to suppress the tape of him splish-splashing naked in a puddle of post-orgy Soviet urine like an albino walrus wallowing in a pool of off-brand apple juice. Authorities will reveal how he rigged the election, stuffed his pocket full of rubles and manipulated the Justice Department to cover it up.\n\n\n\nEven worse ... none of it will matter.\n\nWhen dissecting the authoritarian-esque rise of the lace-front-wearing chief executive, pundits strain to explain why Trump is bulletproof. They point to partisanship, conservatism and the recently discovered phenomenon of working-class white oppression as the reason that 83 percent of white Republicans and 47 percent of all white people still approve of the job he is doing as president.\n\nDespite Trump\u2019s legislative failures, unrepentant racism, and unfortunate allergy to facts and truth, The Donald\u2019s devotees will not admit that he has committed a single misstep. He has convinced congressional Republicans, Fox News watchers and people who consider Nick Cannon \u201ctoo urban\u201d that verifiable evidence means nothing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor them, thousands of media outlets have formed a secret cabal to perpetuate fake news. The FBI, CIA, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and the mythical \u201cdeep state\u201d have all manufactured his decadeslong connection with Russia. Random women have all made up similar lies about his sexual misdeeds. Even science and math have joined the party to misstate his popular vote totals, his poll numbers and how many people showed up to his inauguration. There is only one way to explain why logic and reason no longer apply to the president:\n\nDonald Trump is a God.\n\nTrumpism has evolved from a political ideology into a religion with an unerring tyrannical messiah at the center of it all. He is no longer a politician, he is a religious figure, and admitting it is the first step to understanding the cultlike devotion to Donald Trump.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Gospel According to Trump\n\nI do not make this claim without acknowledging the fact that I, too, have made a god out of a mere mortal. Even before I knew or understood what religion or a Bible was, my mother was my first deity, and her words might as well have been written in red in a religious text.\n\nLike Trump\u2019s acolytes toward him, when it came to my mother, I believed that whatever came out of her mouth was the unadulterated truth. In the rare instances that I questioned her, she responded to my queries with the same reasoning offered by the president or a Baptist preacher forced to answer a biblical inconsistency:\n\nBecause she said so.\n\nWhen someone points out that immigrants are less likely to commit a crime, that white men commit more acts of terrorism or that the economy is a product of Obama\u2019s policies, Trump bypasses reason and doubles down on rhetoric. Even though net immigration has been negative for more than 10 years, Trump\u2019s followers believe that kicking out Mexicans and Muslims will magically transform America into a utopian paradise in the same way that some Christians show up on Sundays to pay 10 percent of their income to an already wealthy pastor to buy a seat in the VIP section of the afterlife.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump\u2019s fans dismiss anyone who questions as an unholy blasphemer using their carnal mind. Nothing has to make sense. He said it. That\u2019s enough.\n\nThus sayeth Trump.\n\nTrump Is Great and Worthy of Praise\n\nWhen talking about Trump\u2019s disciples, we often imagine poor whites in the South and Appalachia who haven\u2019t had anyone so blond and worthy of reverence since Rick Flair hung up his unitard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut even learned men have converted to the cult of Trump, as his Cabinet meetings have become eerily similar to the last supper or the final Kool-Aid brunch in Jonestown, Guyana, replete with seemingly intelligent people showering him with praise. He even opens every meeting with praise and worship devotional service:\n\nHe is no longer campaigning, but like other religious figures, Trump travels around the country holding tent revivals and rallies whipping crowds into Holy Ghost-like frenzies when he preaches. He\u2019s not doing this for votes. He\u2019s just spreading his gospel to the masses, calling NFL players \u201csons of bitches\u201d and explaining how he could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue in New York City and shoot a man, all to thunderous applause.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe entire Republican Party has joined the church, including the seemingly sane apostle Paul Ryan, who gushed over Trump\u2019s \u201cexquisite leadership.\u201d Ben Carson even thanked his lord and savior for Donald Trump in a recent White House prayer.\n\nLater this year, Trump will go all out and order the U.S. armed forces to honor him with a formal military parade. The Navy SEAL who killed Osama bin Laden criticized the plans for a formally attired military display as \u201cThird World bullshit,\u201d but those of us who have attended a black church know that the choir always marches in on the pastor\u2019s anniversary.\n\nTrump Is a Miracle-Maker\n\n\u201cHe performs wonders that cannot be fathomed, miracles that cannot be counted.\u201d \u2014Job 5:9\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyone examining the cult of Trump cannot ignore his incredible record of accomplishments:\n\n\n\nThere might be some people who fact-check these claims and discover that none of them are true, but those people aren\u2019t true believers. When members of his congregation casually dismiss truth as \u201cfake news,\u201d they are essentially accusing the press of being false prophets trying to smear their savior. Anyone who besmirches his sanctity is a heathen, a liar or\u2014even worse\u2014a Democrat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey will tell you that he kept America safe from terrorism because they don\u2019t count the Las Vegas killing, the Texas church massacre, the Unite the Right killing, or any of the long list of mass shootings and hate crimes as \u201cterrorist events,\u201d in the same way that God answers prayers when anything good happens, but it\u2019s Satan\u2019s fault when anything bad occurs.\n\nThat\u2019s how the cult of Trump works. It also explains why trying to apply reason to the presidency of Donald Trump is an exercise in futility. Facts are irrelevant. Logic is meaningless.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis followers will never believe he\u2019s racist. Republican voters will continue to reject the claims of the 18 women who have accused him of sexual misconduct. Fox News won\u2019t even cover any scandal that doesn\u2019t have to do with Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama. Trump is Teflon. He will never be impeached out of office, even if the FBI investigation turns up concrete evidence that shows he colluded with Russia or obstructed justice.\n\nThe fact that he has been deified by white America is not likely to change.

The 14-episode first season was an exploration of what Blay calls \u201cblack-girl culture\u201d\u2014in all its regular, degular, schmegular everyday magic. As she stated in her launch video, \u201cWhatever it means to be a black girl, I\u2019m that.\u201d\n\nHere at The Glow Up, we couldn\u2019t agree more, which is why we were excited to speak with Blay about the next phase of Professional Black Girl. It\u2019s been a profound and joyful labor of love for the professor and now producer\u2014with an endowed chair in political science at North Carolina Central University\u2014whose academic work has focused specifically on black body politics and black racial identity:\n\nMost of my work is about trying to teach through images. I use images\u2014and now, moving images\u2014to spark conversations ... [but] the fulfillment for me now is coming from recognizing that the internet and these platforms are my classroom. The joy that I get when the light bulbs go off for my students, I also get that when just being able to have regular conversations with folks and throwing some information, or pushing folks to think a little differently.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe conversations sparked by the first season of Professional Black Girl resonated deeply with all types of black women. This, despite the show\u2019s concept being a happy accident that occurred while Blay was developing another series, centered on black hair:\n\nAnd then, once I launched it, it just became a thing. I mean, I wasn\u2019t ready for it, but it brings me so much joy. I\u2019ve gotten so many messages from women\u2014I mean, women have stopped me on the street just to say \u201cThank you.\u201d And it\u2019s, like, amazing to me to hear women who are, like, literally rocket scientists, and medical doctors, and CEOs who are saying, \u201cGirl, thank you.\u201d\n\nNow she\u2019s ready to take her show on the road, hoping to film her second season in New Orleans\u2014hopefully, with a little help from her Professional Black Girl friends:\n\nNew Orleans is and has long been considered probably the most\u2014not just black\u2014but the most African city in America ... I\u2019m used to being in black spaces, but, like, there\u2019s something different about New Orleans and it\u2019s really\u2014for me\u2014it\u2019s culture, you know? And so, when I think of how I came to be a professional black girl, of course it\u2019s based upon my memories and my experiences growing up in New Orleans. There\u2019s just nowhere like New Orleans, you know? I just feel like we deserve so much better than the memory of Katrina. Like, we still there, so wanting the joy that Professional Black Girl has brought to us up to this point, [I\u2019m] wanting to bring some of that to New Orleans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a brief 48 hours, Blay\u2019s season 2 Kickstarter campaign has gained significant steam. But as she now works to bring this project to NOLA and beyond, she could use our support\u2014and is already focused on the bigger picture:\n\nMy intention is to crowdfund this, But I hope it catches the attention of a major platform or production company or angel investor or somebody with some money who recognizes how important this is to black women. ... We\u2019re out here, [and] we want to see a variety of depictions of ourselves and our experiences in the same kind of regular ways that white folks get to see themselves. And this is regular, everyday kind of joy. And so, I\u2019m constantly thinking of how I can move the project forward ... each season will be another city, and through Professional Black Girl experiences, then you would get to know a little bit about the city, outside of whatever is the popular area ... I\u2019m trying to think of places that we don\u2019t always go to.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Professional Black Girls ourselves, here\u2019s the official endorsement from The Glow Up: If you haven\u2019t yet checked out Professional Black Girl for yourself, you definitely should. It\u2019s addictive and affirmative. And if you feel moved to support, you should do that, as well. But more than anything, whatever kind of Professional Black Girl you might be, be that\u2014in all of your regular-black-girl glory. Because all other credentials aside, trust us, it\u2019s enough.

On Friday he confirmed that he was under investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller and then pointed out a rather interesting note, all in one tweet:\n\nThis tweet made me howl, for a number of reasons:\n\nIt\u2019s completely inaccurate.\n\nIt confirms that the president is being investigated for the firing of FBI Director James Comey.\n\nIt shows why everyone inside the White House wants this jackass to stay off Twitter.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of work for one tweet.\n\n\n\nNow, let\u2019s break this all down. Trump is being investigated by Mueller, not Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, but sources at Fake News Fox News have confirmed that this was all Rosenstein\u2019s shade to catch:\n\nRosenstein\u2019s May memo critical of ex-FBI Director James Comey\u2019s performance was among the reasons cited by Trump and others in Comey\u2019s firing. Soon after Comey\u2019s ouster, Rosenstein\u2014who had been Comey\u2019s direct superior at the Justice Department\u2014appointed Mueller, a former FBI director himself and a friend of Comey\u2019s, to lead a wide-ranging probe, ostensibly focused on Russian meddling in the U.S. presidential election but also encompassing a host of allegations made against Trump and his associates.\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUntil the president\u2019s tweet, it was unconfirmed as to whether or not the president was officially part of Mueller\u2019s investigation. The tweet seems to confirm that he is, in fact, being investigated, but CNN notes that it\u2019s unclear whether Trump\u2019s text is referring to reports that he\u2019s under investigation or whether the White House received official notice that he\u2019s being investigated.\n\nWhich leads to why everyone remotely associated with Trump wants his dumb ass to stay off Twitter. It\u2019s one thing to be an incompetent leader who can hide behind an intelligent staff (see: the second Bush). But Trump\u2019s insistence on speaking directly to his followers as if he\u2019s the lead singer of a boy band is leading to more trouble.\n\nSarah Huckabee Sanders, the deputy White House press secretary, has to answer for his dumbass tweets, and CNN notes that she\u2019s referring inquiries into his tweets to his private attorney, Marc Kasowitz. This proves how reckless his tweeting has become: His press staff can\u2019t even answer for him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut for those of us who wish him out of office, this might be his best use of 140 characters.

Chase is as much of a reason for guests to come as her food.\n\nHer 95th birthday was Jan. 6, arriving just as the city began celebrating its tricentennial. The culinary icon was just a few days shy of her own milestone when The Glow Up caught up with her.\n\nAs she makes her way back into the kitchen for a chat, she doesn\u2019t get far before an excited food blogger comes up behind her. Anxious but polite, he asks, \u201cPlease, Mrs. Chase, can I take a picture with you? We love you in Brazil!\u201d\n\nShe happily obliges, turning around with her walker to pose for a photo. She\u2019s rocking a hot-pink jacket emblazoned with \u201cChef Chase\u201d over the left pocket, a matching bedazzled cowboy hat and the widest smile.

Together, the two eventually took over the po\u2019boy sandwich shop and bar that Dooky Chase Sr. and his wife, Emily, founded and turned it into a sit-down restaurant with Leah cooking the meals.\n\nDuring the civil rights era, the upper room of Dooky Chase\u2019s was the spot where movement leaders held their planning meetings over a plate of her food. Ray Charles immortalized the restaurant in his song \u201cEarly in the Morning,\u201d and Disney used Chase\u2019s story as the inspiration for its first black princess, Tiana, in The Princess and the Frog. When Beyonc\u00e9 filmed her iconic visual album, Lemonade, in the city, she featured Chase sitting in front of gold curtains on a plush chair fit for the Queen of Creole Cuisine.\n\nFor Chase, it\u2019s all in a day\u2019s work.\n\n\u201cEverybody can\u2019t be a leader.

Before she made her way to New Orleans in the sixth grade because of the small town\u2019s lack of high schools for black children, Chase helped her father plant food for their family and neighbors to eat.\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t one to plant one little row to service his family,\u201d she says of her father. \u201cHe planted plenty so he could share it around.

It was our first outing together, and he was going through the regular first date particulars. All the while my mind wandered, thinking about if my new liquid lipsticks had been shipped yet, wondering what sheet mask I should apply tonight, when and if someone is gonna finally kill Ramsay Bolton\u2019s ole sadistic ass. It wasn\u2019t that my date was particularly boring. No, we had rather nice and lengthy conversations over the phone before we met face-to-face. Standard for me, as I hate going on a first date completely foreign to the person I\u2019d be spending the next few hours with. He had passed the initial conversational tests; decent sense of humor, didn\u2019t say anything transphobic, homophobic, misogynist, or self loathing. All seemingly low standards, but as a 31-year-old Black woman in the field, all standards a lot of men frequently fail to meet.\n\nHe was a generally attractive guy, in good shape, great job, all the good on paper qualities that should count for at least something. He made me laugh, and seemed very interested in me. And still, even though I was generally fond of him, and even toyed with the idea of fucking him, I still couldn\u2019t get my mind off how much I would\u2019ve rather been home. Soon, I began to feel guilty. Here I was wasting this guy\u2019s time, I had no business being on a date, and I didn\u2019t realize it until I was sitting across from him.\n\nTypically, I actually enjoy going on dates. I don\u2019t get out the house much if it isn\u2019t with my son, and any excuse to gussy up and let the world know this old gal still got it is met with some enthusiasm. I usually obsess over the visual details, nail color, makeup (Evening glam? A natural beat? Winged liner? Vamp?) hair, ensemble, accessories, scent. Not so much that I think the guy even notices that shit, just all the bells and whistles that make me happy and feel at my most confident. I enjoy the ritual of femme performance and adornment. But this time? I threw on a coat of clear polish, tied my hair up in a bun, put on medium coverage foundation, a nude lip, a maxi dress, and called it one. I didn\u2019t feel like beguiling anyone, I didn\u2019t feel like pretending to be charming, or effervescent, I just didn\u2019t feel like playing. I had checked out, not just on him, but on dating period.\n\nIn retrospect, I suppose the writing was on the wall. I had recently came off a break up from a 1 \u00bd year relationship. I wasn\u2019t reeling with pain, but I was bored and desired companionship. My best friend, also coming off a breakup, suggested I throw my hat back in the ring and download Tinder. I resisted for weeks, until finally, I gave in. As he had warned me, my selection of bachelors was rife with dudebros, a sea of mayo, it looked as if I was picking men from a Cubs game, or a Kanye concert. Eventually I was able to match up with some colored folk, and began the underwhelming dance of Tinder messaging: Banal two-three day intervals of smiley faced emojis and the following small talk/icebreakers:\n\n\u201cHi Gorgeous\u201d\n\n\u201cHow was your weekend?\u201d\n\n\u201cI loved your pictures\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you do?\u201d\n\nI frequently stared at these messages, internally groaning, tasked with the job of turning this shit into something engaging. Even then I forced myself to respond with the tepid, \u201clol I\u2019m good how are you?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI realize that these initial steps are always awkward, but I didn\u2019t remember it being this painful. Horrified by the monotony of Tinder communication, I signed up for another site to see for myself if this was just par for the course with the app, or my fate in online dating. Fear confirmed; dozens of \u201cHey miss lady\u201d and profiles of \u201cGod Fearing men who aren\u2019t here to play games\u201d later, I resigned myself to my reality. But still, I was haunted by the questions, \u201cWas it always this boring? Are people just not interesting or witty anymore? Have things changed that much, or is it me?\u201d Even with the guys I had managed to progress from message purgatory with, my interaction felt forced. It didn\u2019t help that I had the misfortune of speaking with a Morehouse grad who earnestly referred to himself as a \u201csapiosexual,\u201d and a short film producer who wanted to argue the possibility of the world being flat. Every fiber in my being responded with a resounding \"meh\" with every man I had contact with. I didn\u2019t respond to text messages for hours or even days later; any attempts to facetime me, any request for a picture, all met with disdain.\n\nSo, what the hell was I doing and why was I subjecting myself and these poor schmucks to this painful exercise in futility? I suppose I figured it was time to move on, and this was how I typically moved on. But, so far my dating experience felt like I was at a house gathering, trying to figure out which partially drunk can of room temperature Pepsi on the table belonged to me. I kept picking up random cans nearby and shaking em to see if I could tell if it was the right one, had the right amount of contents, if it was mine. None of them were, it was just a bunch of partially empty God damn cans. It was time for me to be honest with myself and realize I had nothing to offer anyone but general apathy and the occasional desire for sex and companionship. I know you\u2019re thinking that most men would be more than happy to oblige such an arrangement, but you\u2019d be mistaken. Even men want to know that you are somewhat interested in who they are, what they like, what they think, etc, even in casual arrangements. I soon found I couldn\u2019t even muster up the desire to do that. I\u2019d rather watch Sephora haul videos on YouTube.\n\nUltimately, I made the decision that Jay Z should have made when someone asked him to do a verse on the \"All The Way Up\" remix, I decided to sit my ass down and leave people alone. I cancelled all my accounts, and began the process of fading to black. Soon realizing, it wasn\u2019t just dating I had divested in, after my last breakup I had also decided I was done with the emotional labor involved with romantic relationships in general. I don\u2019t want to learn, I don\u2019t want to teach, I don\u2019t want to compromise, meet people halfway, to hurt, to forgive, to make space, to give space, to love, to lose, to reclaim, growing, regressing, progressing, decaying, wash, rinse repeat until the wheel lands on \u2018free spin\u2019 or one of us dies. I just\u2026don\u2019t wanna do it again. That cycle is fulfilling and completely worth it, for millions of people, I\u2019m just not included in that population.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am comfortable with accepting this about myself because it's not coming from a place of scorn, or hurt (even though those are totally valid reasons), but an honest self assessment. I\u2019m warming up to the idea of living the rest of my life sans the pursuit of a committed partner, and enjoying continuing to invest in myself, and the friends and family that I love. I\u2019m opting out, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a phase, I think this is it, and it\u2019s actually kind of a freeing to say it out loud. I know I hit all the markers for people to dismiss this proclamation as the swan song of a bitter Black bitty. Hell, I\u2019m a feminist, a Black woman, single mother divorced by the age of 25, etc. Lots of folks will mutter \"yeah right bitch, like you had a choice lol.\" That\u2019s expected, and I\u2019m ok with it, because the alternative is participating in a farce, to save face, in an effort to prove to the world that I\u2019m desired and that I am not bitter.\n\nHowever, the older I\u2019ve gotten, the more aware I am of the few facets of life in which we are really able to exercise choice. Long term partnership or relationships is just one facet where I am exercising mine. This doesn\u2019t mean that my decision doesn\u2019t come with its drawbacks. Of course I\u2019ll have bouts with loneliness, and ever since I hit 30 my libido is that of a jack rabbit drinking a maca root smoothie during mating season. But long as God sees fit to keep Xvideos's server lifted in favor, and I still have the names and numbers of old work stored in my phone, I think I\u2019ll be fine. I have great friends, dope family, an amazing kid, fantastic eyebrows, and my best friends' Netflix password. Things not lookin' too shabby for ya girl.

It was here that I acquired my first job, my first apartment, and my first sugar daddy. All within six months which, if you think about it, is a damn good list of accomplishments for an 18-year-old community college dropout.\n\nI don\u2019t know how I learned about the world of sugar daddy dating, but I found its mecca, Seeking Arrangement, via Google, and within 48 hours of signing up, my entire life changed.\n\nNow, there\u2019s never been a shortage of men wanting to have sex with me. And even at 18, I\u2019d clocked a year on OKCupid (thanks to a mom who had no idea how to monitor my internet usage and my own personal laptop), so I was used to a bombardment of online (and offline) attention from horny men. What I was not used to, however, was a bombardment of online attention from horny, rich men. Men who wanted to pay my rent, buy me shoes and take me out to restaurants with napkins folded into swans and shit, all just to spend time with me. And hopefully, eventually, spend time with me naked.\n\nShit was lit.\n\nMy very first taste of sugar was from a man named Rod. I mean, that wasn\u2019t his name, but I didn\u2019t change it to protect him, I changed it because I forgot. After a while, all rich White men start to just blend together. But I digress. Rod was, in the words of Nene Leakes, very rich, bitch. He owned several car dealerships and lived down the street from a couple of Houston Rockets. He\u2019d spent millions of dollars on custom suits, wine he\u2019d never drink, and really awkward African statues with huge penises that he informed me were meant to \u201cpromote fertility.\u201d Why a 72 year old man needed to have anything to do with fertility is still beyond me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore our first date, Rod asked if I\u2019d been to any of the \u201cnice\u201d restaurants in Houston, yet. At this point, \u201cnice\u201d to me was still Luby\u2019s on a Sunday evening, so, of course, I answered no. He named some fancy ass place and asked if I had anything to wear. It was Houston in the summer, and as a barely above-minimum-wage employee, my wardrobe mainly consisted of black collared shirts, shorts for work that I kept getting written up for, Keds and some Forever 21 dresses. Again, I answered no.\n\nNow, you\u2019ll probably call me stupid and naive for this next part and I won\u2019t blame you.\n\nRod was sympathetic, but probably also just didn\u2019t want me to show up and embarrass his ass, so he asked for my info, so that he could send me a little cash with which to buy something nice. I didn\u2019t hesitate. I gave him all the details required to send a Western Union transfer, and he sent me a receipt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThree. Hundred. Dollars.\n\nThis man, who I\u2019d never met, sent me $300 just to buy something to wear to dinner with him. I was blown away.\n\nThe day of the dinner, I got off work around 4pm. Since I worked downtown, I just walked over to Macy\u2019s to go get my outfit. Unfortunately, it took me absolutely forever to find something, and I scrambled back to work to drop my clothes off in my locker, change, and rush off to catch the 81 bus to the restaurant on Post Oak Blvd. I fired off a text about running late, and my phone died just as I was walking in. I didn\u2019t worry about it, as I knew my way home and he\u2019d offered me a ride back, anyway. We had a lovely dinner and I had my first glass of wine. I was a lightweight then, and I\u2019m a lightweight now, so that one glass of chardonnay had me tipsy enough to agree to go back to his place.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was a long drive up to the Woodlands, but goddamn, his house was nice. The biggest house I\u2019d been in at that point had been my godmother\u2019s with four bedrooms and two stories. His had six. All for him. And two living rooms.\n\nNow, Rod, like most old, rich White men I'd encounter, was really fucking horny. And weird about it. He kissed with too much tongue, he made stupid sexual jokes, and would reach over and grab my breasts in the middle of conversation. At the time, I was a very sexual young gal, but I still hadn\u2019t gotten to a point where I could just have sex with someone for money, especially if I didn\u2019t find them attractive. Obviously, that\u2019s changed, but then, I was just creeped out, so I pretended I was tired and he said he\u2019d drive me home.\n\nIn the car, Rod turned into every boy I\u2019d dated in my one year of college. \u201cYou got me so worked up,\u201d \u201ccan\u2019t believe you\u2019re leaving me with blue balls,\u201d \u201ccome on, just touch it.\u201d When he unzipped his pants and put my hand on his penis, I snatched my hand away, and that\u2019s when shit got dark.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s when, at 11pm on a Wednesday night, on i-45, near Spring, Texas, a 72-year old man stopped his car, unbuckled my seatbelt, and told me to get out of his car.\n\nI was stunned. I told him to stop joking, and he assured me he wasn\u2019t. Tears sprang to my eyes, my heart started racing, and all I could think about was my dead and useless phone in my purse. \u201cPlease.\u201d The look in his eyes told me not a chance, and I slowly\u2014still hoping he\u2019d change his mind\u2014opened the door, and stepped out.\n\nHe sped off before I even closed the door all the way.\n\nAnd there I was. Stranded, with no idea where I was, in a too-short dress with too much cleavage, on the fucking freeway with no way home.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo I started to walk. And I walked. And I walked. I probably walked about two miles before I got to an exit where I could see civilization. I passed a couple car dealerships and distinctly remember Rod saying he owned one on the way to his house. I wondered which one. I kept walking to a Kroger. Teary eyed, I bought a bottle of water, and calmly asked my cashier if there was a phone I could use because my date had stranded me and I needed a way home. She called her manager\u2014luckily, also a woman\u2014who took me to the employee break room, let me use the phone, and gave me twenty dollars for the cab ride. It ended up being more than that. Life before Uber was tough.\n\nAs soon as I got home, I opened my laptop, ready to delete my Seeking Arrangement account forever.\n\nInstead, I noticed I had a new message. From a man named John, in Los Angeles.\n\nI looked at the new shoes I\u2019d bought with Rod\u2019s money\u2014that surprisingly weren\u2019t ruined after walking two miles on the freeway. I looked at the gorgeous Betsey Johnson clutch I\u2019d bought for the night, and the BCBG dress I got on clearance and, finally, at the $100 I still had left because my momma raised me to be cheap.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI messaged him back.\n\nThe next day, I bought a spare battery for my phone that I kept charged and in my purse. And just six days after that, I was on my first plane, ever, to LAX.\n\nLakyn is a twenty-something aspiring Beyonce living in LA.

He enrolled at Howard University to continue his biology degree, and because he no longer had the scholarship he had while at Xavier, he turned to the Federal Emergency Management Agency for help.\n\n\u201cSo they asked like, \u2018What did you have?\u2019\u201d Allen told WUSA9. \u201cWhat did you leave down there?

He owed a total of $12,203\u2014the original $10,000 he was given plus a 28 percent penalty the department assessed for having to collect the money from him in the first place\u2014and the agency was going to begin garnishing his wages to get the money.\n\nThe Treasury Department said it had tried unsuccessfully to contact him about the debt in 2013 but got no response after sending mail to at least two different addresses it had for him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFEMA decided that the funds that they gave me, I was ineligible for,\u201d Allen told WUSA9. \u201cI lived through Hurricane Katrina, but I\u2019m ineligible for these funds.

I don\u2019t even understand how they just arbitrarily chose this.\u201d\n\nAllen was told that he was ineligible for the funds he had received, but he was not given a reason as to why he has been deemed ineligible. When neither FEMA nor the Treasury Department could give him a straight answer, he turned to WUSA9.\n\nInvestigative reporter Erik Flack began making phone calls on his behalf, and eventually, FEMA arranged for Allen to receive a phone call on a Friday night.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was on that call that Allen learned that he was considered ineligible for the funds because FEMA was not supposed to have given funds to college students who applied through the method he used. To put it another way, Allen unwittingly used the wrong application process, and FEMA did not catch the error, but now that it has, he is being penalized for it.\n\nTo make matters worse, because FEMA had already transferred the debt to collections, Allen could not appeal the finding.\n\nIn response to a request for comment, FEMA sent a statement to WUSA9 that read: \u201cFEMA reviews disaster-assistance payments to ensure those payments have been properly awarded and appropriately spent. Whether through human or accounting errors, duplication of benefits, fraud, or other reasons, assistance sometimes goes to individuals who are not eligible.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWUSA9 reports that while FEMA did not respond to questions about how often this type of thing happens, federal oversight offices say improper and potentially fraudulent payments after Katrina total between $600 million and $1.4 billion.\n\nFEMA told Congress in a 2011 report that it has put in a new system of checks and balances that has drastically reduced the problem of improper payments.\n\nRead more at WTSP 10 News.", "keywords": ["garnishing", "mans", "wusa9", "hurricane", "funds", "fema", "given", "allen", "check", "told", "agency", "katrina", "treasury", "used", "department", "ineligible"], "polarity": 0.023607503607503598, "subjectivity": 0.38295093795093793},

My son has had the same nightmares every night since then as well. Most people will say, \u201cBe lucky he wasn\u2019t shot or killed,\u201d but when you send your child to college, the last thing you expect to happen is for him to call you at 1:30 a.m. on a Sunday saying that a traffic stop turned into police officers drawing their guns.\n\nEarly Sunday morning, my son was heading back to his college campus in Petersburg, Va., after hanging out in Richmond, Va. He was driving, and his friend from college was the passenger.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust a few blocks from approaching the gates of their university, they spotted the Chesterfield County, Va., police at what looked like checkpoints near an off-campus party location. According to my son, he approached a stop sign, stopped and proceeded through it. Shortly after, as he was approaching the university, cops pulled him over, saying that he had done a \u201croll stop\u201d instead of a full stop (we\u2019ll get back to this in a few).\n\nAnd here\u2019s where the story goes from being just a routine stop to every parent\u2019s nightmare:\n\nThe cops then used the age-old tactic of, \u201cSir, we smell marijuana in your car,\u201d and asked my son and his friend to exit the vehicle. Mind you, neither of them smokes. The only smells ever in my son\u2019s car are those of his dirty gym clothes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Chesterfield County police officers (who were white) then approached my son and asked if he was carrying a weapon. My son informed them that he had his pocketknife in his pocket (a knife that is legal to carry and which I had given him because of the area where his school is located).\n\nWhen my son went to pull up his shorts to show the officers the knife in his pocket, guns were drawn on him. Because I\u2019ve had the \u201ctalk\u201d with my son several times, he knew what to do if ever he was in any sort of contact with police. As the cops continued to search his car and found nothing, my son and his friend remained calm and actually talked about their history paper on democracy. The irony.\n\nAfter the search was over and the guns were put away, one of the Chesterfield County police officers asked my son and his friend if they were OK with how the situation had been handled. And, of course, they replied, \u201cYes.\u201d Because, of course, the officers were trying to intimidate them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter they gave their reply, the officers laughed and sent them on their merry way, without a ticket for this alleged \u201croll-through\u201d of a stop sign.\n\nMy son called me at 1:23 Sunday morning. I thought it was his usual check-in call, but he was hysterical, angry and scared. I had no idea what was going on because I couldn\u2019t get him to calm down. He had remained calm in front of the police officers because I had told him to never let them see you sweat. But as soon as he was away from them and got me on the phone, there was no reason not to let out his anger and frustration.\n\nAs soon as he told me what had happened, my heart sank. And the anger rose. First with my son, because I had warned him about being out on a Saturday night in that area. As a young black man with a fairly decent car, you\u2019re bait for cops. But then I became enraged because my son has done everything right in life and can\u2019t even attend college without being profiled and ending up looking down the barrel of a police officer\u2019s gun.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy son was so distraught, he couldn\u2019t even tell me which police department had pulled him over. For reference, in the area of his university, there\u2019s the Petersburg Police Department, the Colonial Heights Police Department, the Chesterfield County Police Department and the university\u2019s own police department. I literally had to call each police department to figure out which was involved in the stop. And after I called Chesterfield County twice, the sergeant on duty finally said that its Police Department was involved.\n\nAround 3 a.m. Sunday, I was informed by the sergeant on duty that its officers were equipped with bodycams and that he had seen the video, and if I wanted to have a copy, I should put in a Freedom of Information Act request. And so I did.\n\nThe following morning, Feb. 5., my FOIA request was denied by Karen Leonard, the department\u2019s FOIA officer, who in an email wrote, \u201cThe Code of Virginia, \u00a72.2-3706, Virginia Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), states that complaints, memoranda, correspondence, case files or reports, witness statements and evidence relating to a criminal investigation or prosecution, other than criminal incident information, are excluded from the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I asked what exactly was being investigated, since no citation or crime was committed, Leonard replied, \u201cCriminal investigations do not always result in charges or arrests. I have referred you to the investigator, Officer Murphy, for any information he can share.\u201d\n\nSo, of course, I emailed Officer Murphy of the Chesterfield County Police Department, and he wanted to know what information my son had shared with me. Yeah, no. Why would I give that information?\n\nHe then informed me, \u201cDue to the fact that he is an adult, I am not allowed to discuss anything that he has not informed you of previously. That is why I was asking you to please share with me what your son has already told you so I know what I can and cannot discuss with you.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I asked for an authorization form my son could sign, to release any information about the stop to me, Murphy seemingly went silent.\n\nRegardless, before all of the interaction with Murphy, on the advice of an attorney, I had already filed a complaint with the Chesterfield County cops\u2019 internal-affairs department.\n\nThere have been other complaints from students about the actions of the police officers in the area when it comes to harassment. But unlike my son and his friend and me, many are afraid to speak out. But if you choose to be silent, you\u2019re choosing to keep others in harm\u2019s way and not changing the flawed law enforcement system.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, here I am now, with the same headache from Sunday. Still trying to help my son process the fact that he\u2019s lucky he wasn\u2019t shot or killed. Still trying to figure out the next steps. Still trying to figure out why guns were drawn. Still trying to figure out why college students at an HBCU aren\u2019t even safe from the cops who should be protecting them, not profiling them.", "keywords": ["county", "cops", "stop", "officers", "friend", "information", "draw", "son", "receive", "chesterfield", "guns", "child", "trying", "feels", "department"], "polarity": -0.023083028083028083, "subjectivity": 0.3914896214896216},

Especially in black history month black people cannot continue to be treated this way. My friend and I were shopping at the independence center in independence, Missouri(Near Kansas City), when we were done we decided to get a bite to eat at Applebee\u2019s. About an hour into [our] dinner we were approached by a Independence police officer, a mall cop, and the restaurant manager. We were told that we were accused of eating and not paying for CHICKEN the day before (dining and dashing). Mind you that we have proof that can show our whereabouts and it\u2019s not even in our character to steal. After being mocked, humiliated, and embarrassed we were asked to pay for our food, leave, and not come back. After leaving, calls were made to the restaurant and the manager stated that our accuser remembered that there was a SKINNY girl and a girl who wore MAKEUP. In 2018 is this really what we\u2019re debased to? Our weight and whether or not we wore makeup. She could not recognize any facial features or any defining characteristics . This is a clear example of RACIAL PROFILING that should not be stood for. Just because we are black does not mean we are all criminals and I will not be treated as such. #repost Applebee\u2019s Grill & Bar\n\nIn the video, it is easy to see that both women are shocked, embarrassed and upset at the accusation.

Gordon maintained that she should be, while Newman said she was there to speak as someone whose family members had been killed, though not by police.\n\nNewman did answer questions about Trump, however, saying that she disagreed with Trump\u2019s recent remarks that police should not be so \u201cnice\u201d to suspects taken into custody. She also insisted that, as she is often the only African American at the president\u2019s policy table, it is important that she be there to transmit black anger over such statements.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not at the table, you are the menu,\u201d she said.\n\nWatching was an overflow crowd in a room only half as large as could accommodate those who were lined up to attend. Many were enticed by an overheated Page Six story in the New York Post that reported \u201cheavy drama\u201d at the convention because of Newman\u2019s scheduled appearance. Of those who were admitted, eight stood and turned their backs to the stage.

Hannah-Jones and Cobb pulled out of the panel, and Bounce TV\u2019s Ed Gordon stepped in to serve as the event\u2019s moderator,\u201d Carlos Greer reported in the Post Thursday. His piece was headlined, \u201cOmarosa causes uproar at National Assoc. of Black Journalists conference.\u201d\n\nConvention chair Ryan Williams considered the story over the top.

In June, Yanez was acquitted of all charges by a Minnesota jury.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSandra Sterling is the aunt of Alton Sterling, who was fatally shot by police in Baton Rouge, La., the same month. According to police, officers Blane Salamoni and Howie Lake saw Sterling, 37, outside a convenience store after it was reported that a man had threatened someone there with a gun. Police said Sterling, who was selling CDs outside the store, fit the description of that man, Matt Zapotosky and Wesley Lowery reported in the Washington Post.\n\nThe NABJ plenary session, \u201cBlack and Blue,\u201d this year\u2019s effort to honor the memory of sociologist, intellectual and civil rights leader W.E.B.

Do it all,\u201d she said. Asked by Gordon how she feels seeing the video of her nephew\u2019s shooting replayed over and over, she said, \u201cit\u2019s like I died every day with him for 365 days.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGordon told the audience when the afternoon session began that he knew of the \u201c800-pound gorilla\u201d in the room\u2014Newman\u2019s scheduled appearance. He urged \u201ca little decorum,\u201d and declared that no stipulation had been placed on him stating what he could ask. Gordon said that Newman had requested not to appear by herself and would join a group discussion.\n\nNewman entered to polite applause after a second panel was introduced that included retired Los Angeles Police Sgt. Cheryl Dorsey, author of \u201cBlack and Blue\u201d; political analyst Jason Johnson of Morgan State University, who is also political editor of TheRoot.com; Arthur \u201cSilky Slim\u201d Reed, a former gang leader now a motivational speaker, and BuzzFeed writer Joel Anderson.\n\nNewman said she wanted to talk about the impact of losing relatives to violence, saying that most people \u201cjust don\u2019t know me.\u201d But was not long before Gordon turned the conversation to Trump.

When arresting \u201cthese thugs,\u201d Trump said then, \u201cPlease don\u2019t be too nice.\u201d\n\nLaw enforcement officers around the country denounced the statement, and the White House responded that Trump was joking.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNewman told Gordon that nothing she said would appease him, and asked whether the panel had become simply a dialogue between the two of them.\n\nShe also said, \u201cno black boy should be treated the way Freddie Gray was, or any of these other young men were treated,\u201d referring to the 25-year-old Baltimore man who died in police custody in 2015.\n\nAsked for his response, Reed said, \u201cfirst of all, Freddie Gray was not a boy . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPressed for her own responses to such deaths, Newman advised the audience to Google \u201cEric Garner\u201d and her own name.\n\n\u201cLook for yourselves,\u201d she said. The suggestion was met with groans.\n\nAlong the way, three, then four, five, six and finally eight audience members stood with their backs to those on stage. Others walked out. The BuzzFeed report said, \u201cBrittany Packnett \u2014 a Ferguson protester who rose to prominence inside the Black Lives Matter movement as a part of the policy group Campaign Zero, and a well-respected activist on race, justice, and policing \u2014 was among the less than ten protesters who stood with their backs to Manigault as she spoke. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Gordon asked whether the White House was aware of \u201cthe anger that some of us feel,\u201d Newman replied, \u201cI think they see it. We\u2019re very keen on that,\u201d and noted that the administration had invited civil rights leaders, the Congressional Black Caucus and other African Americans to come to the White House. The Congressional Black Caucus has refused.\n\nRep. Cedric Richman, D-La., the Caucus chair, told NABJ\u2019s opening session on Wednesday, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to the White House for a social gathering.\u201d He wrote to constituents in June, \u201cWe gave the administration a 130 page document. No Response. We sent 8 letters. No Response. We have had zero meetings with cabinet secretaries.\u201d\n\nAnd when he [Trump] didn\u2019t take us seriously, we declined a second meeting. Because we have to get his attention.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNewman said at the panel discussion, \u201cWhen you don\u2019t come to the table, decisions are made whether you\u2019re at the table or not.\u201d\n\nEventually, Newman left the stage.\n\nGlover stood in front of the audience to explain that NABJ felt obligated to to invite members of the Trump administration to the convention, that Newman had accepted and that Friday was the only day she was available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGordon, still on stage, replied that organizers had discussed Newman\u2019s appearance for an hour and a half and that \u201cit would be foolhardy to assume that we would sit here and not ask certain questions.\n\n\u201cLet us close this out. I\u2019ll see you at the White House Christmas party in December,\u201d Gordon concluded, raising his fist.\n\nNABJ issued this statement:\n\n\u201cAs an organization of professional journalists, NABJ seeks to have candid and frank conversations with newsmakers. For years, the NABJ has invited the White House administration to partake in the annual convention. We appreciate that the Director of Communications for the White House Office of Public Liaison Omarosa Newman is participating this year and has come to share her perspective on issues that are critical to our members, and moreover, critical to the communities that we serve.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHannah-Jones, who watched the proceedings from the audience rather than the moderator\u2019s perch, told Journal-isms as she left the discussion, \u201cYou can see that I made the right decision.\u201d\n\nCobb wrote on Facebook, \u201cA man does not grow up on the South Side of Queens in the crack era without learning to recognize a set-up when he sees one.\u201d\n\nHe elaborated, \u201cUnder other circumstances, maybe. But NABJ was talking some craziness about her being there as someone who has been impacted by violence, not as a member of the administration. So it wasn\u2019t even clear we would actually get to discuss anything important. More likely it was going to devolve into precisely the kind of fiasco that wound up happening. So basically, the idea was to get people with good standing in the community and reputations for doing serious work and drag them into a gutter of ad hominem insults.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI can play the dozens with the best of them (Drew Hall, 87-88) but not in my professional setting, not when I\u2019m sitting next to the grieving mothers of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling, not when we\u2019re dealing with an ignorant administration that has used insult and distraction to its advantage so shamelessly. And not when I\u2019m there with someone whose whole agenda is to turn a serious forum into reality TV.\u201d\n\nAt the annual NABJ business meeting earlier Friday, Glover and Shirley Carswell, interim executive director, announced that the convention had attracted 3,289 registrants, an unaudited Thursday figure, of which 2,554 were paid.

(Shoutout to Issa and Molly!) Black women\u2019s friendship is more than boozy brunches, epic catfights and screaming \u201cYasss Queen\u201d to one another. I mean, don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014all of these are small elements of our bonds\u2014but to fully capture and re-create the sisterhood of black girls\u2019 friendships, you need limitless talent.\n\nGirls Trip has just that, from the star-studded ensemble cast\u2014Queen Latifah, Jada Pinkett Smith, Regina Hall and Tiffany Haddish\u2014to the film\u2019s director, Malcolm D. Lee, and producer (and 2016 The Root 100 honoree) Will Packer.\n\nGirls Trip comes out Friday, and it\u2019s about time! We\u2019ve been patiently waiting (to exhale) since 1995 (when Waiting to Exhale was released) for a beautiful group of black female friends who love and support one another, despite all of life\u2019s ills, as a plotline in a major motion picture.\n\n\n\nIn order to fully understand this movie\u2019s stretch beyond a black female version of The Hangover, you\u2019ve got to understand that Girls Trip\u2019s director and producer are geniuses in bringing out simple, yet compelling human nature in their characters.\n\nFirst, let me tell you about the subtle complexities of each character:\n\nSasha: Queen Latifah plays this bad-and-boujee journalist who found her way into the gossip-blogging world and is finding it hard to keep up appearances and page views. Queen plays Sasha with integrity and a stubborn vulnerability that makes you root for her throughout the movie. Her friendship means something, but she holds on to hurt because she wants those who have wronged her to acknowledge their wrongdoing.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRyan: Regina Hall plays this cookie-cutter, have-it-all, best-selling author, trophy wife and heir to Oprah\u2019s throne. Ryan is married to the thick chocolate brother Stewart Pierce (played by Mike Colter, whom we all know from Luke Cage). Well, he\u2019s no hero in this movie, and Ryan is torn between maintaining her picture-perfect image or living happily ever after in an unplanned way. Hall\u2019s character means well but is often misguided by her own decisions.\n\nDina: Tiffany Haddish\u2019s may be the most hilarious character in this movie. She steals every single scene she is in with her raunchy humor and one-liners. But there\u2019s something refreshing about Haddish\u2019s character. She\u2019s the type of woman you\u2019d kill to have as a friend because honestly, she\u2019d kill for you. She\u2019s the definition of ride-or-die and never spares her friends from brutal honesty. She\u2019s a lot of things, but one thing she is not is a bad friend.\n\nLisa: Jada Pinkett Smith plays the resident mother hen of the group. She\u2019s the type to wear a full-length, hand-embroidered Guatemalan skirt to the club. She\u2019s a single mother who dotes on her two young children way too much and lives with her mother. Lisa is clearly all about family, and that is something she takes into her friendships. She\u2019s conservative, kind and in real need of all the deliciousness that is Kofi Siriboe, who plays her young buck, Malik.\n\nTogether, these women make up the \u201cFlossy Posse.\u201d Sasha, Ryan, Dina and Lisa went to college together and vowed to continue their friendship long after they received their degrees. They meet up for their \u201cgirls trips\u201d as often as they can, but the Essence Festival trip from the movie is evidently after the Flossy Posse\u2019s meet-ups have dwindled down. This reconnection is important to the foursome, and so is each character\u2019s growth throughout the movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though the movie relies on laughter to carry it, you can tell that the characters have been tenderly cared for. Each woman is a full person, complete with dualities in her personality. Lisa is a perfect doting mother, but it takes just a little convincing (from Dina) to get her to let young Malik give her all the sexual healing her body\u2019s been craving. And you think that Ryan is never going to let go of her flawless image, but eventually she does. Sasha somehow avoids the one shady and lucrative action that could save her blog, and watching her character grow through moral and financial dilemmas is exhausting, but may even remind you of your own journey to being a better person. And Dina\u2014well, she never changes, but honestly, her beautifully ratchet character doesn\u2019t need to. Be warned: Her moments are the raunchiest and the funniest, but so worth it.\n\n\n\nThis movie is everything you think it is: a beautiful display of black not cracking on the faces of these stressed-out, middle-aged women who allow themselves an unadulterated weekend in sultry New Orleans during Essence Festival. Obviously the group\u2019s wild card, Dina gets them into more trouble than they know how to get out of (thank God for Larenz Tate\u2014who plays Julian Stevens\u2014a musician-turned-heartthrob for one of the women. He\u2019s a knight in shining armor), which is what makes the movie swim along in such hilarious fun that there\u2019s hardly a moment without sidesplitting laughter.\n\nLee and Packer capture the unbreakable bonds of black women\u2019s friendships. This special connection, despite the trials, is strong enough to take on infidelity, truth telling (over sparing feelings) and those all-too-real, I\u2019m-sick-of-your-shit moments that end a lot of fragile friendships. No doubt, black women strive in a world that doesn\u2019t support us the way we support it. I\u2019ve watched my own friends lift up people, places and things that have done nothing but tear them down. The hearts of black women are large and capable of that type of love for what doesn\u2019t always love us back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd to see each of these characters love each other hard was just the type of refreshment we needed the silver screen to bless us with. Yes, you are going to see Girls Trip because you wanted to laugh till you cried, and you will, but you\u2019ll also get to leave the theater with a full heart. You\u2019ll also likely want to call up your girls and plan the next trip.

In this case, Hanceville Mayor Kenneth Nail claims he\u2019s gotten nothing but a thumbs-up from his constituents after reaching out to New Orleans leaders offering to take the city\u2019s now-banned Confederate monuments and display them proudly in his city.\n\n\u201cEverybody who\u2019s approached me has said they think it\u2019s a great idea, and it seems like I haven\u2019t offended anybody\u2014which is never the goal,\u201d Nail told the Cullman Times.\n\nOf course, of course, Nail even has a black friend who approves and offered to chip in to help move the monuments\u2014which, you know, celebrate slavery, racism and generally the wrong side of history\u2014to their dear old town.\n\n\u201cOne of my good friends, who is black, even messaged me on Facebook and told me, \u2018Look, some of my ancestors were forced to fight in [the Civil War], and I think it\u2019s a good idea to remember these things,\u2019\u201d Nail claimed. \u201cHe told me, \u2018I drive a truck, and I\u2019ll even go down there and pick them up if the city needs me to.\u2019\u201d\n\nAnyway, the Times reports that Nail recently sent a letter to New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu asking about the four statues that were recently removed in light of protests and, you know, general acknowledgment about what the men they depict stood for.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was previously reported that the four monuments\u2014an obelisk honoring the militia known as the White League, a statue of Confederate President Jefferson Davis, a statue of Confederate Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard and a statue of Robert E. Lee\u2014would have been stored in an undisclosed location.\n\nThe removal of the monuments in the wake of a 2015 City Council vote to censor the images was not without contention and was met with protests.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNonetheless, down they came, and now Nail wants them. In his letter to Landrieu he wrote: \u201cWe have located in our city a Veterans Memorial Park that honors all Veterans and all struggles. We would put these monuments on display there. They would be safely protected and enjoyed by all people who visit the park.We would truly consider it an honor and a blessing for you to kindly make allowance for our humble request.\u201d\n\n\u201cI sent the letter to see what they might do,\u201d he told the Times. \u201cI don\u2019t know if they\u2019re going to sell them, give them away or something else. Honestly, we\u2019re a small town, and if they end up selling them off for a lot of money, of course we couldn\u2019t do that. If they do give them away, then I would approach the [Hanceville] City Council to see how they want to proceed.\u201d\n\nOf course, Nail is of the school that says it\u2019s about \u201cheritage,\u201d not \u201chate.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I told the mayor, and what I\u2019ve told everyone I\u2019ve talked about it with, is that for me, remembering these people and these events is about heritage\u2014not hate,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsk certain folks to talk about slavery, though, or police brutality and they froth at the mouth. So I guess only some events and people should be remembered.\n\nAnyway, Nail went on to say: \u201cAnybody who knows me knows that I\u2019m no racist. But ultimately, it will be up to the folks in New Orleans\u2014and up to the people who live in Hanceville, and the Hanceville City Council\u2014to decide what\u2014if anything\u2014happens next.\n\n\u201cMy view is that it\u2019s an opportunity, a great teaching tool that we could have in our city,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for all of us to reflect on all our struggles, and to celebrate how far we\u2019ve come\u2014while clearly acknowledging that we had those struggles. Different symbols mean different things to different people. We definitely don\u2019t need to forget or be blind to history, which I think some well-meaning folks in our society are kind of pushing for, intentionally or unintentionally.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNail, admittedly, is not the only Alabamian in government working hard to keep the Confederacy alive. Back in May, Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey signed legislation designed to prevent cities and counties from removing Confederate monuments from public property, \u201cpreserving\u201d at least nine Confederate monuments around Alabama.\n\nRead more at the Cullman Times.", "keywords": ["course", "confederate", "disassembled", "mayor", "memorial", "does", "hanceville", "nail", "orleans", "know", "display", "city", "wants", "told", "park", "recently", "times", "monuments"], "polarity": 0.09619374966597188, "subjectivity": 0.5091112848057292},

Right now, however, I\u2019m sitting here slightly annoyed because my flight was delayed, but mostly just perplexed about what happened after I passed through security just now.\n\n\n\nAfter walking through the body scanner, I was asked by a Transport Security Administration agent to wait.

Like loads of other filmgoers around the country, many of them arrived early and dressed in African-inspired garb to watch the movie.\n\nThe Sun notes what 22-year-old college student Tabitha Morgan wrote in an email:\n\n\u201cI was very pumped to go see the movie. Like ever since I first seen Angela Basset styling silvery white dreads, I knew I had to go see it,\u201d she wrote. \u201cOnce we arrived in Towson and just seeing people with African print skirts, dashikis, and Black affirmation shirts, I was so excited.\u201d\n\nBut that excitement soured later in the evening when, after some delays, attendees were told that all Black Panther screenings for that night would be canceled because of technical problems. One Twitter user mentioned waiting at the theater over an hour before being told that the movie wouldn\u2019t be shown.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Jeanine Carter, a 33-year-old paralegal, told the Sun: \u201cThere was a lot of cussing.

For a blockbuster being shown on multiple screens, Kieley says, it\u2019s safe to assume that the theater would have backups.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way a large exhibitor like that would have technical issues at the last minute,\u201d Kieley said, adding that the whole thing \u201csmells really rotten.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo other film screenings were canceled, so it wasn\u2019t a theater-wide technical issue. Just any theaters / DCPs that were showing Black Panther,\u201d Keiley wrote. \u201cSeems awfully convenient.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to one Twitter user, 10 showings in total of Black Panther were canceled that evening.\n\nFurther complicating matters is a curfew, imposed in 2016, at the Towson theater and accompanying mall for unaccompanied minors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBack then, officials with the Baltimore County chapter of the NAACP raised concerns about how the curfew might discriminate against teens of color, but there was \u201cno outcry\u201d against the curfew, the Sun reports.\n\nThe curfew is enforced only on Fridays and Saturdays, which means that it would not have been in effect on Thursday, the night the Black Panther screenings were canceled. Some readers who wrote in to The Root wondered whether the lack of a curfew to enforce played into the theater\u2019s cancellation.\n\nThe Towson Cinemark employees told the Sun that all Black Panther screenings for Friday would continue as planned.", "keywords": ["eyebrows", "wrote", "theater", "canceled", "screenings", "mess", "curfew", "md", "screening", "cancellation", "movie", "told", "panther", "black", "wakanda", "towson", "raising"], "polarity": 0.005948000412286124, "subjectivity": 0.3812646876932591},

So keep the check with you, verify, take your time,\u201d he said. \u201cSimply we were just going there to deposit a check. We were not asking for money.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut even despite his affable approach to the situation, Ali soon found himself in handcuffs. \u201cI was talking to them for less than five minutes and I found the police behind me, handcuffed me, confiscated everything and took me outside,\u201d he explained.\n\nAli said more than 15 police cars showed up for his arrest.\n\nTo make matters worse, two other members of Ali\u2019s family\u2014his wife, Hadil, and their 15-year-old daughter Hawra, who were not even in the bank at the time of the incident, but waiting in the car outside\u2014were also taken into custody for reasons beyond comprehension.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s assume I made a mistake and gave them a bad check,\u201d Ali suggested, according to the Wichita State Sunflower. \u201cWhy would they arrest my wife and daughter?\u201d\n\nThe police even took it upon themselves to call the private school that Ali\u2019s 11-year-old son attends and tell the school to hold the child because the family was in police custody.\n\nWhen all was said and done, the family was in custody for almost three hours, bewildered as to what was going on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t say why or what happened or what did we do. I\u2019m trying to figure out what did we do,\u201d Sattar Ali said.\n\n\u201cNo one told me why I was being arrested until we were being released,\u201d he told the Sunflower. \u201cThey didn\u2019t read me rights or anything.\u201d\n\nAli now believes that he was racially profiled and called out Wichita for the actions taken against him and his family.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey jumped to conclusions,\u201d Ali told the Sunflower, because the check was \u201cpresented by someone named Sattar Ali, not James or Robert.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes Wichita not welcome any foreigners? Then tell us. Be up front and forward with people and say, \u2018You are not welcome in our city,\u2019\u201d he added, according to KAKE.\n\nHe was also confused as to why the bank couldn\u2019t verify the check but police managed to. It was later reported that the bank did not, in fact, call Dearborn to verify the check, but instead for some reason placed a call to Boise, Idaho, KAKE notes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEmprise, for its part, appears to be unrepentant, issuing a statement claiming, \u201cWe are aware of a situation at the 21st and Woodlawn branch yesterday and can confirm that our team acted in accordance with our policies and procedures. If faced with the same circumstances today, we would expect our team to take the same actions.\u201d\n\nAli, who originally lived in Wichita from 1999 to 2008, told the Sunflower that this was the first time he ever felt unwelcome.\n\n\u201cI would expect this in the 1950s. Not now,\u201d he said\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want people to feel sad for me. I just want people to be aware that we have an issue,\u201d Ali said. \u201cThis shouldn\u2019t be a product of 21st century.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe outraged father said he plans to take legal action in response to the arrests.\n\nRead more at KAKE and the Wichita State Sunflower.\n\n", "keywords": ["going", "arrested", "sunflower", "verify", "took", "family", "sattar", "wichita", "check", "ali", "told", "iraqiamerican", "deposit", "bank", "large", "sale"], "polarity": -0.04504504504504503, "subjectivity": 0.389060489060489},

Even the trailer for the movie caused discussion and dissent. Fraternities are a brotherhood, and this movie looked like a public airing of dirty laundry.\n\nGerard McMurray\u2019s film, Burning Sands, arriving March 10, is the story of Zurich, a student at the fictional Frederick Douglass University making his way through hell week of Lambda Lambda Phi, a black, Greek-letter organization. The movie deals with the topics of academics, history, the importance of HBCUs and myriad other issues. Take a look at an exclusive clip from the movie:\n\nBut it is mostly about pledging.\n\nHazing has always been a contentious topic among fraternity and sorority members. Its advocates say it is part of a long-held tradition that can\u2019t be understood unless you belong, while detractors paint it as a needless, brutish ritual whose time has long passed. These two diverging opinions clash head to head in Burning Sands.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is plain that McMurray, who directed and co-wrote the film, gleaned much of the film\u2019s material from his experience as a member of Omega Psi Phi (a fraternity to which I, too, belong). McMurray doesn\u2019t shy away from showing the brutality, purposeless tradition and unhinged machismo that have intertwined themselves into the pledge process of many black Greek-letter organizations, which is sure to upset many fraternity and sorority members.\n\nWhat the trailer doesn\u2019t show, however, is how the movie balances this narrative by having the main characters continually voice\u2014to themselves and others\u2014that they want to endure the process, often reiterating how they understand the choices they are making. It explores the topic and allows the viewer to make up his or her mind.\n\nThe star of the movie, Trevor Jackson, prepared for the role by talking with members of Kappa Alpha Psi to get an unbiased view of pledging. Explained McMurray: \u201cI wanted to ask this question. I knew it would upset some people, but I think the film explores the question without passing judgment.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith the film debuting during a time when black moviegoers have complained about the lack of diversity in stories for people of color, both McMurray and Jackson are proud that they were able to produce a film that shows educated, well-rounded characters outside of the \u201cslave narrative\u201d who don\u2019t need to be rescued by a white savior. The movie doesn\u2019t try to appeal to a wider, more mainstream audience by explaining itself or watering down the content.\n\nBurning Sands forces the viewer to take an unfiltered, close-up look at the tradition of pledging and whether it belongs in a civilized, new-millennium world.

There, I said it! And as a straight, cisgender Afro-Caribbean woman, I noticed how my privilege shielded me from certain challenges as a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Inc.\n\nI say this about my organization and others when I say it\u2019s time to revisit what it means to be a National Pan-Hellenic Council, or NPHC, woman. And by that, I mean it\u2019s time to stop clutching our pearls about lifestyles we don\u2019t \u201caccept\u201d or \u201cunderstand,\u201d and admit that we have created a culture that is the antithesis of liberating black people. And I\u2019m not the only one who sees that.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs organizations rooted in Christianity, sororities follow certain traditions that underscore heteronormative and feminine ideas about women that make it difficult to fit the mold. For 35-year-old Rachel Crouch, this made it difficult to \u201cpass\u201d or simply be an active member of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority Inc.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to be active because I don\u2019t feel like I fit in. I mean the simple fact that you can\u2019t wear pants to events, and I would never put on a skirt. And why would I want to be a part of a system/organization that makes me feel like I have to change who I am?\u201d Crouch said, touching on the rules that often guide official proceedings of BGLO (black Greek-letter organization) sororities.\n\nCrouch was initiated into Delta Sigma Theta 15 years ago, and admitted that she hid her sexuality in the beginning. \u201cI actually pretended to be straight so my sexuality wasn\u2019t the determining factor,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, that doesn\u2019t mean that supportive chapters don\u2019t exist\u2014for instance, chapters like the one of which 23-year-old Candice Delgado is part. She says her chapter had a \u201clarge LGBTQ membership, ironically,\u201d which made her experience as a lesbian Greek woman both unique and positive. She described her sisters as supportive and respectful, who tried to help broaden her support system as black and LGBT.\n\n\n\nAs a newly initiated member of Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority Inc., Delgado shared that the image of an NPHC woman is mainly of a straight, cisgender woman. \u201cEspecially in BGLOs, since homosexuality is still frowned upon in the black community,\u201d she wrote in an email.\n\nThe only time Delgado said she felt isolated was when it came to bonding over the things sisters often share; the intricacies of their sex lives and relationships. Delgado said that her sisters never made her feel awkward about it, but also being femme made it easier to \u201cblend into the mold,\u201d in her opinion. For Crouch, being a masculine lesbian was \u201cabsolutely\u201d isolating.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI was in the closet, and the only thing my line sisters and I talked about while working together was Delta and men. I had nothing to contribute to the conversation and felt out of place,\u201d said Crouch.\n\nSo even after becoming a member, women like Crouch either have to maintain the facade to protect themselves or risk \u201ccoming out\u201d and being ostracized. And it\u2019s members in positions of power who make open acceptance of the LGBT community a flat-out \u201cno,\u201d even if certain people weren\u2019t homophobic. So when Crouch\u2019s sisters found out that she was a lesbian, they were generally accepting, but her older sisters, or \u201cprophytes,\u201d were not.\n\n\u201cIt was horrible,\u201d said Crouch about the experience of coming out, even with supportive sisters.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo Crouch, representation of the LGBT Greek community in BGLOs wasn\u2019t the problem. It was how LGBT members were treated within those organizations. She said that within her 15 years of being a Delta, she has interacted with many gay Greeks and described it as \u201crefreshing.\u201d But this also has not motivated her to remain an active voting member.\n\nCrouch and Delgado are black women who joined for the same reasons any straight woman would.\n\nDelgado said that she became a member of Sigma Gamma Rho to be a part of something bigger than herself. And even after the negative experience of coming out, Crouch said that she would still encourage other young women to seek membership, and can recall positive moments where her sexuality didn\u2019t matter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe national president asked my sister and I to be the resident artists for Centennial. It was an honor I couldn\u2019t describe,\u201d Crouch said. \u201cThat\u2019s when I\u2019ve felt the most accepted in Delta. Everyone loved us, and it didn\u2019t matter that we were gay.\u201d\n\nBut the \u201chow\u201d often means a difference of opinion on a conversation that isn\u2019t so popular. I reached out to Alpha Kappa Alpha, Delta Sigma Theta and Sigma Gamma Rho and received no comment on whether they support LGBT women in their organizations.\n\nBut women like Crouch believe that change has to start at the national level, whereas Delgado thinks it should start within the chapter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAs chapters become more accepting, then nationals will see it and will follow suit. I believe that there should be branches in both fraternities and sororities for the LGBTQ population to join if that\u2019s where they\u2019re more comfortable,\u201d said Delgado, who would also describe the experience of being queer in a BGLO as \u201clow-key supportive, almost like a mom who loves their child more than they hate who they love.\u201d\n\nBoth Crouch and Delgado share an unwavering pride in and love for their sororities. Ultimately, BGLOs\u2019 failure to successfully replicate experiences more like Delgado\u2019s nationwide is rooted in the black community\u2019s struggle with homophobia. But what little is known about the LGBT community in black Greekdom makes it even easier to ignore.\n\nThis is why research done by educators and LGBT members of NPHC organizations is even more vital in order to move forward. Brandon Stroud of the University of Rochester\u2014an educator, femme gay man and member of Omega Psi Phi Fraternity\u2014started researching the LBGT experience in BGLOs before being initiated in 2011. After recruiting five fraternity members to survey, he shared that NPHC\u2019s culture of silence forces LGBT members to hide, making it harder to solve the representation issue when no one wants to be labeled \u201cgay.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStroud shared that during his survey, \u201cinterestingly enough, when it came to sexual identification a lot of men still identified as MSM [men who have sex with men] because the stigma of using any language associated with the LGBTQ community could place them at risk of losing family and friends and possibly relationships within their organization.\u201d\n\nAnd the stereotypes that perpetuate ideas about femininity and masculinity, in his opinion, \u201coftentimes may place individuals lives in danger\u2014for LGBTQ members that means keeping your sexuality under wraps.\u201d He cited instances of increased hazing to prove one\u2019s worth or ability to fit the straight, cisgender mold.

Whether they are blood relatives, football teammates or sorority sisters, they all understand the unwritten rule that applies to these bonds:\n\nDon\u2019t put our business in the streets.\n\nBefore Netflix has even released its newest movie focusing on a black fraternity at a historically black college, it has already been embroiled in controversy. Even the trailer for the movie caused discussion and dissent. Fraternities are a brotherhood, and this movie looked like a public airing of dirty laundry.\n\nGerard McMurray\u2019s film, Burning Sands, arriving March 10, is the story of Zurich, a student at the fictional Frederick Douglass University making his way through hell week of Lambda Lambda Phi, a black, Greek-letter organization. The movie deals with the topics of academics, history, the importance of HBCUs and myriad other issues. Take a look at an exclusive clip from the movie:\n\nBut it is mostly about pledging.\n\nHazing has always been a contentious topic among fraternity and sorority members. Its advocates say it is part of a long-held tradition that can\u2019t be understood unless you belong, while detractors paint it as a needless, brutish ritual whose time has long passed. These two diverging opinions clash head to head in Burning Sands.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is plain that McMurray, who directed and co-wrote the film, gleaned much of the film\u2019s material from his experience as a member of Omega Psi Phi (a fraternity to which I, too, belong). McMurray doesn\u2019t shy away from showing the brutality, purposeless tradition and unhinged machismo that have intertwined themselves into the pledge process of many black Greek-letter organizations, which is sure to upset many fraternity and sorority members.\n\nWhat the trailer doesn\u2019t show, however, is how the movie balances this narrative by having the main characters continually voice\u2014to themselves and others\u2014that they want to endure the process, often reiterating how they understand the choices they are making. It explores the topic and allows the viewer to make up his or her mind.\n\nThe star of the movie, Trevor Jackson, prepared for the role by talking with members of Kappa Alpha Psi to get an unbiased view of pledging. Explained McMurray: \u201cI wanted to ask this question. I knew it would upset some people, but I think the film explores the question without passing judgment.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith the film debuting during a time when black moviegoers have complained about the lack of diversity in stories for people of color, both McMurray and Jackson are proud that they were able to produce a film that shows educated, well-rounded characters outside of the \u201cslave narrative\u201d who don\u2019t need to be rescued by a white savior. The movie doesn\u2019t try to appeal to a wider, more mainstream audience by explaining itself or watering down the content.\n\nBurning Sands forces the viewer to take an unfiltered, close-up look at the tradition of pledging and whether it belongs in a civilized, new-millennium world. While the subject matter may prompt wild differences of opinion, Jackson notes, \u201cAt its heart, what I love about the movie is that it is a story.

It has nothing to do with my dislike for you or your people. In fact, some of my best friends are white. Well ... one of my best friends is white. OK, I\u2019ll be honest, all of my best friends are black, but one of them is kinda light-skinned, and when I was in the 11th grade, I went to a New Edition concert with three Caucasian classmates, so that should count for something.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut my hesitancy in penning this correspondence is based on another fact: I didn\u2019t believe you were real. I didn\u2019t discount your existence the way I don\u2019t believe in unicorns, good cops or Rihanna. (Yeah, I said it. I believe Rih Rih is a highly advanced, computer-generated image based on our collective fantasies. You might think it\u2019s crazy, but I stand by my research.)\n\nWhen people told me that there were actual individuals upset about the upcoming Marvel movie Black Panther, I thought they were exaggerating or overestimating the number. I suspect there are always a few fringe kooks who share an idiotic ideology.\n\nKyrie Irving and B.o.B think the Earth is flat. Some people believe that Donald Trump is both stable and a genius. And once, on the dance floor of a crowded nightclub, a woman told me I was handsome and cute. (At least that\u2019s what I think she said, although she may have said, \u201cYou\u2019re standing on my foot.\u201d It was pretty crowded and I\u2019d consumed a few beverages. But for the sake of this argument, let\u2019s just say it was the cute thing.) My point here is, sometimes people have wildly diverging opinions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust as I was ready to dismiss the notion that there might be more than a handful of people who disliked the notion of a Black Panther movie before they even saw it, someone sent me a transcript of Rush Limbaugh ranting about liberals embracing Black Panther.\n\nI honestly get why Limbaugh was upset. If I were a half-deaf, impotent walrus who had to sit in front of a microphone yelling to white senior citizens who still listen to AM radio while popping Oxycontin like Tic Tacs during commercial breaks, I\u2019d probably be a little jealous of T\u2019Challa, too. Plus, Limbaugh is racist, and the film does have the words \u201cBlack\u201d and \u201cPanther\u201d in it, so .... there\u2019s that.\n\nBut people kept sending me things. There was a story calling Black Panther \u201cobviously racist,\u201d a Breitbart article that called the comic book \u201cBlack Lives Matter-themed,\u201d and that piece where Ben Shapiro crumpled into a rice-paper-thin ball of fuckboy fragility in a nonsensical monologue about how this is the fault of black people, leftists and, of course, Barack Obama.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, that\u2019s only three racists people.\n\nAnd then, like a fool, I ventured into the land of white nonsense where coffee machines and Bluetooth speakers somehow have all colluded to form a plot to eradicate the great arrhythmic race: Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s Twitter,\u201d I reasoned. White people on Twitter are like the Incredible Hulk when he\u2019s off his meds: They\u2019ll get mad at anything. Then I happened upon this well-reasoned discourse between writer Zack Linly and a random Facebooker:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can understand why some white people are upset. After all, I distinctly recall how upset black people were about Harry Potter, The Lord of the Rings, When Harry Met Sally, Twilight, Terminator and The Passion of the Christ (yes, they literally made a movie about Jesus with no black people!).\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be fair, the above-mentioned movies were not comic book movies. Making a film about a superhero from an all-black place is an egregious offense. Especially since Marvel put so much detail into making sure its other superhero movies had diverse casts.\n\nI recall how the white outrage forced Hollywood into casting a South American actress to play Wonder Woman, since she was from a fictional race of Amazonian warriors. (I didn\u2019t Google it, but I\u2019m pretty sure Gal Gadot is from Brazil or somewhere. If she were Israeli or something, it would mean white people didn\u2019t care about the ethnicity of comic book characters until a black one came around and triggered their racist ... you know what? I\u2019m not even going there. She\u2019s gotta be from South America, or wypipo would look very stupid right now.) We really thank you for making sure they include black actors every time they flash back to Superman\u2019s home planet of Krypton.\n\nPlus, I\u2019m probably making up the white outcry when someone floated the idea that Donald Glover might be the next Superman, or Idris Elba could play James Bond. I probably imagined that wypipo were upset about John Boyega playing a Stormtrooper, just like I dreamed about Rihanna or that woman who thought I was handsome. (I\u2019m pretty sure she said \u201chandsome and cute,\u201d not \u201cstanding on my foot.\u201d I mean ... I was actually standing on her foot, but that\u2019s neither here nor there.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause white people have repeatedly stood up for inclusion and diversity in casting, we would like to admit that this is our fault. Forgive us for being excited that there is finally a movie that caters to our sensibilities without kowtowing to the notion of a white savior.\n\nI tell you what we\u2019ll do. To make this up to you, we promise that we will remain marginalized, mostly ancillary characters in most of the Hollywood blockbusters for the rest of the year. We also swear that we will allow you to win and be nominated for the bulk of Oscars, Golden Globes, Emmys, Tony Awards, Peabody Awards, Billboard Awards, MTV Awards, America\u2019s Got Talent, spelling bees, luge races, school shootings, mass murders, police-shooting trials, Senate races and rose ceremonies on The Bachelor.\n\nI don\u2019t want there to be any hard feelings.

I thanked her without smiling as she led me to the bright cell with cornflower-colored bars where I would stay until I was summoned once more to be fingerprinted. I wondered how the woman in the cell across from mine could sleep, curled up in a fetuslike ball. She seemed oblivious to the goings-on around her.\n\n\n\nI was still in my cocktail dress and stiletto heels, my makeup fresh. My left arm felt tender, a result of having an officer squeeze it tightly as he led me, handcuffed, to the squad car.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat are you in here for?\u201d a young Asian woman in the same cell as the snoring woman asked.\n\n\u201cViolation of the noise ordinance. I was having a birthday party for a friend,\u201d I replied. She, along with the four other women waiting to be processed, was in disbelief. \u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d I insisted.\n\n\u201cWhere do you live?\u201d a young black woman with sweatpants and a T-shirt inquired.\n\n\u201cIn Chevy Chase,\u201d I answered. She began to shake her head, and I knew why.\n\nThe Barnaby Woods neighborhood of Chevy Chase in Washington, D.C., is a heavily Democratic, progressive enclave known for its walkability and lush greenery. It is also the neighborhood chosen by Vice President Mike Pence to live before he moved into the vice president\u2019s mansion. In an act of resistance, residents hung rainbow flags and placed signs in their yards proclaiming their commitment to inclusivity and diversity. In that moment, I felt proud to belong to a community that seemed to be on the right side of history.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe neighborhood, while progressive, is not racially diverse, with about 10 percent of the population African American or other people of color. It is also the wealthiest zip code in the city. Most African Americans in the city reside in wards 7 or 8, across the Anacostia River, where poverty rates hover above 30 percent. I am one of only a handful of black people in the neighborhood.\n\nI chose Barnaby Woods because of its top-ranked public elementary school. I have 7-year-old twins and was not interested in competing for the too few slots available for decent schools in the citywide lottery. Finding a home here felt like such a boon.\n\nOn Sunday night, I hosted a milestone birthday party for a dear friend whom I have known for more than a decade. She also recently landed a big job as a senior vice president at a prestigious firm. Long-ago friends had flown in from across the country to celebrate with us. The party began in earnest at 9:30 p.m., and by 10:45 p.m., a little more than an hour later, I was arrested and in a squad car headed down to the 2nd District precinct.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe police officers, one white and the other black, responded to a noise complaint from my neighbors. When I came to the door, I noticed the demeanor of the white officer right away. He was not friendly. I believed that he was surprised that it was I, an African-American woman, who had come to the door.\n\nThe officer proceeded to let me know that I was in violation of the noise ordinance that had begun about 15 minutes prior to his arrival at 10:15 p.m. He asked me to turn off the music. The second sentence out of his mouth was, \u201cYou can be arrested for this.\u201d He then returned to his squad car. I worked frantically with another guest to turn the music down and to research the noise ordinance.\n\nAfter about 20 minutes of waiting at the foot of my driveway, the white officer returned to my porch and arrested me for violating the noise ordinance. I was silent. I knew what could happen to me if I asked a question or refused to go. Immediately I thought of Sandra Bland, the black woman pulled over for a routine traffic shot in Texas who, days later, was found dead in her jail cell; the young girl, also in Texas, who was assaulted by a police officer while attending a pool party; and the high schooler in South Carolina who was manhandled by a school safety officer while sitting at her desk.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI could be beaten or, even worse, killed. And it would be my fault. My fear was justified. I also thought about my children, who were away at a slumber party, and how panicked they would feel if I failed to pick them up the following morning.\n\n\n\nWhen my friends\u2014doctors, lawyers and other professionals in their best clothes\u2014gathered in the driveway to inquire about why he was arresting me, the white officer refused to respond and replied only that he \u201cdidn\u2019t have to listen to this.\u201d He scrambled into his squad car, but not before hitting one of the guests with the door as he slammed it shut. Before I was placed in the car, the music had been turned completely off.\n\n\n\nIn that moment, we all felt hopeless and helpless. We were the \u201cgood\u201d blacks. We had all done the right thing: gone to college, purchased homes and had outstanding careers. We followed the rules. I am the first in my family to graduate from high school, attend college and earn a Ph.D. If there was, in the words of W.E.B. Du Bois, a Talented Tenth, we were among them. However, none of that mattered.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I arrived at the police station, I was left handcuffed in the squad car. Both of the arresting officers got out of the car and huddled by the precinct door. Before I knew it, a visibly frustrated sergeant appeared and asked pointedly why I had been arrested and not just given a citation or ticket. The officers had no answer.\n\n\n\nIn the most recent history of the noise ordinance, there have been no arrests in the Barnaby Woods neighborhood under similar circumstances. While I was being fingerprinted, the black female officer told me that in all of her 29 years on the force, she had never seen anyone arrested for violation of the noise ordinance.\n\n\n\nBack at my home, although there was no music, the police continued to harass the remaining guests. The officers refused to leave the scene until they were told to do so by a higher commanding officer.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter I was released a couple of hours later, I was welcomed with smiling faces by a group of friends who had been dispatched from the party to make sure I was OK. On the drive home, I hoped that the party was still carrying on. It was. When I entered the house, there was a collective sigh of relief. I was seemingly unharmed and in good spirits. However, I was rattled to my core.\n\n\n\nWhat I know to be true is that although I have managed to achieve a certain measure of personal and professional success, I have never been fooled into believing I was above the dehumanizing treatment and suspicion often visited upon black people regardless of class or education. Through marked and sometimes painful experiences of racism, I understand plainly what it means to be black in America and to be robbed of human dignity, not only for what you have failed to achieve because of institutional and structural racism, but also for what you\u2019ve been able to achieve despite these prejudices.\n\n\n\nThat night, I chose to celebrate despite feeling dehumanized and powerless. I would not let them steal my joy.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI see you, Serena Williams, LeBron James, Gabby Sidibe, Forest Whitaker and Colin Kaepernick. We already know what is.\n\nC.

In the past four years, the third-generation hairstylist has been making her mark on Marvel films, leading the hair departments of the last two Captain America films, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 and, now, Black Panther.\n\nOf course, the Black Panther is a unique superhero, and Black Panther is already proving to be an exceptionally unique film, as Friend tells The Glow Up:\n\nI think Black Panther is\u2014I call it a stand-alone Marvel movie, even though Marvel still has a formula. But I feel like it\u2019s a stand-alone movie, especially for me, because I\u2019m a black woman, and [to do] the first black superhero, that was really an honor, in the sense [that] we\u2019re presenting all of this to the world. We had an important job to do, and I looked at it in a whole different way, because it represents my people. So I felt like, the weight of the world on me at some points, but in the greatest way\u2014that I had the opportunity to present us in the best possible light and put something on camera that\u2019s never been [seen]. So it\u2019s a great responsibility and it\u2019s a great challenge, but it\u2019s my greatest joy in doing it, also.\n\nRepresenting her people was paramount in Friend\u2019s mind as she approached the task of helping to bring Black Panther to life. To begin, she divided the film into three elements: traditional Africa, contemporary Africa and the futuristic Africa represented by the technologically advanced civilization that is Wakanda. In her research, she drew inspiration from everything from traditional African tribes like the Maasai and Zulu to the groundbreaking fashion statements we\u2019ve seen at Afropunk celebrations around the globe.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really taking and looking at traditional styles, traditional tribal looks, and seeing what we can make into a modern style,\u201d Friend says. \u201cI like to take, like, a period hairstyle and put it in a modern movie and just put a twist on it. For me, it\u2019s still about classic hairdressing and beautiful lines and silhouettes. That\u2019s how I design hair.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFriend has certainly had her share of experience with period styles, having also headed the hair departments of Miles Ahead, The Help, Django Unchained, Rock of Ages and Dreamgirls. But whether it\u2019s long and flowing or elaborately braided and twisted, one thing you won\u2019t see in Black Panther is any straightened hair. For Friend, natural hair textures were a major part of her contribution to the visual narrative.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a beautiful time where people are wearing their natural hair,\u201d she says. \u201cI mean, there [are] women everywhere who are like, \u2018Throw the pressing comb away, throw the relaxer away. I\u2019m going to wear my natural hair.\u2019 So that whole movement of the empowerment of the hair is there,\u201d Friend explains.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCreating a diverse universe of naturally styled characters involved a team highly skilled in styling, caring for and mimicking natural hairstyles, as in the case of Angela Bassett\u2019s glorious custom-made wig of 24-inch silvery locs, inspired in equal parts by writer Toni Morrison and director Ryan Coogler\u2019s mother, Joselyn.\n\nBut while Friend isn\u2019t playing favorites on the styles she created, she\u2019s already seeing the influence this film is having on our beauty and fashion choices. She\u2019s received countless raves on the twisted crop Lupita Nyong\u2019o rocks as Dora Milaje operative Nakia and graciously provided The Glow Up with the how-to (hint: The key is keeping it close to the scalp):\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the \u2018Wakanda knot\u2019\u2014because it is different than a Bantu knot,\u201d she tells us. \u201c[Because] basically, the hair is rolled down, kind of like a cinnamon roll. And then, once the hair is dried, then, we lifted it from there.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEducating other hairstylists is a huge part of Friend\u2019s career, as her greatest hope is to see more hairstylists performing at the top of their game. That\u2019s why she created Hair Scholars, a consortium of award-winning artists led by Friend in educating and preparing aspiring stylists to be the best at their craft and ready to work in the industry.\n\nFriend knows firsthand the value of having a talented team by her side. She credits her Black Panther team for being a large part of the inspiration and craftsmanship that we\u2019ll see on-screen next week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt just felt like our brains\u2014the brainpower was just so high, and the energy was so high, just because we got to create,\u201d she says. \u201cOr somebody\u2019s like, \u2018Well, let\u2019s try this.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018Let\u2019s try it!\u2019\n\n\u201cSo it was really great to have that think tank, where we could just be in there and be creating, and just really coming up with things on the fly ... just really having the momentum just to create original pieces that are going to stand the test of time on film,\u201d she continues.\n\nAnd of course, we couldn\u2019t end our conversation without asking Friend how it felt to be on the purple carpet for Black Panther\u2019s epic premiere in Los Angeles last week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe premiere was like, you know, it was like 2018 Coming to America\u2014like, it was for real. People took it all the way,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I think what it is too, is as black people, we have like\u2014especially now\u2014there\u2019s a sense of pride. People are wearing their hair natural. People are [saying] \u2018black excellence.\u2019 People are rising to the occasion, and I think this movie comes at the time where black people, we want to step forward; we want to be recognized.\n\n\u201cThis movie hits all the right notes for having a black superhero,\u201d she explains. \u201cI mean, at the end of the day, we all want to be superheroes, in whatever we do. If we\u2019re a mom, if we\u2019re a secretary, if we\u2019re a hairdresser\u2014whatever we do, we all want to be a superhero.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up tip: If you\u2019re an Los Angeles-based hair artist, you can join Camille Friend for a Hair Scholars master class at the \u201cHair and Makeup by ... \u201d Symposium on March 11 from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.", "keywords": ["traditional", "hero", "designer", "having", "teamsupernatural", "think", "movie", "really", "panthers", "camille", "friend", "panther", "black", "natural", "meet", "hair"], "polarity": 0.17398076259489295, "subjectivity": 0.5284920634920632},

However, a new report now indicates that researchers from San Diego State University who helped with the report softened their language a great deal while writing some of the results, and even removed some of the findings entirely.\n\nAccording to the Voice of San Diego, when addressing the overarching question of whether officers and the Police Department as a whole showed racial bias, San Diego State researchers acknowledged that there were differences in the way minority motorists and white motorists were treated. But researchers also added that those differences \u201care by no means unique to the SDPD,\u201d noting that the findings only \u201csuggest\u201d that implicit bias \u201cmay exist\u201d among officers.\n\nHowever, when the Voice of San Diego obtained draft copies of the study from San Diego State, the findings were, in fact, more pointed. According to the report, city officials had attempted to stop the drafts from being released publicly, saying that the disclosure \u201cwould likely increase community tension and discontent.\u201d (Of course, any signs of a cover-up would not have had the same effect, I\u2019m sure.)\n\nIn comparing the draft copy with the final version released to the City Council, the Voice of San Diego found that some of the harsher language had been softened and some findings were completely removed. The changes included the following:\n\n\u2022 In more than two-dozen instances, the word \u201cbias\u201d was replaced with \u201cdisparities.\u201d \u2022 An early draft recommended the department stop making traffic stops for minor violations unrelated to public safety, and instead simply issue citations by mail\u2014something, researchers noted, other departments are exploring. \u2022 Also cut from the final draft was the finding, via police survey, that the majority of officers felt they wouldn\u2019t benefit from additional training in fair and impartial policing. \u2022 The final version of the study found that black drivers were more likely than white drivers to be stopped in only one of the San Diego Police Department\u2019s nine divisions, northeastern, which includes the largely white neighborhoods of Mira Mesa, Rancho Bernardo, Rancho Pe\u00f1asquitos and Scripps Ranch. A draft version reached a different conclusion, finding evidence of racial disparities in three divisions, not just one, and, in aggregate, all police divisions located north of Interstate 8, often considered to be San Diego\u2019s racial and economic dividing line.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Voice of San Diego notes that, regarding the last finding, the study\u2019s lead researcher, Joshua Chanin, professor of public affairs at SDSU, said the change was made because researchers opted to use a different threshold to determine whether a finding was statistically significant. Initially, researchers considered a finding statistically significant if there was at least a 90 percent chance that it was true, but they later changed that threshold to 95 percent.\n\nIn the Northern Division of the Police Department, the likelihood that racial disparities in traffic stops weren\u2019t just by chance was about 93.4 percent, while in the Southeastern Division it was 92.3 percent, and for all of the divisions located above the Interstate 8 divide, it was 94.2 percent.\n\nA draft of the study provided to the city on Oct. 27 noted, \u201c[O]ur analysis of combined stops from all five divisions above Interstate 8 shows that when compared to Whites, Black drivers are 15 percent more likely to be stopped during daylight hours, when driver race is visible, than after dark, when driver race is obscured.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, by the time the final draft rolled around, the finding read as follows: \u201cAnalysis of the aggregated data from [divisions north of I-8] shows no statistically significant difference in the daylight-darkness stop patterns of Black and White drivers.\u201d\n\nChanin said that the intent was to provide a study in which the findings were \u201cunassailable\u201d by the city and the Police Department, and that the 95 percent threshold is considered a standard in scientific research, the Voice of San Diego notes.\n\nHe also stated that the research team thought that the edits were necessary in order to get the Police Department to take the study seriously. However, City Councilman David Alvarez told the site that he wished researchers had found a way to explain that some of the findings were almost within the threshold.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s even more important when you\u2019re dealing with the public who aren\u2019t statisticians and who need to get a narrative and a description of what the findings were because that\u2019s how you\u2019re transparent about information,\u201d the councilman said.\n\nIn an earlier draft of the study, researchers recommended that the Police Department cut back on using traffic stops for equipment violations such as broken brake lights or tinted windows, as a means of improving community relations and officer safety.\n\n\u201cWe note that other police departments are currently in the process of reconsidering their approach to traffic stops in this way by directing officers to focus on the violations most related to safety, such as speeding and the running of red lights,\u201d the draft noted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nResearchers also recommended that officers just record the car\u2019s license plate number and suggested that the department implement a system to give the driver a warning or \u201cfix-it\u201d ticket through the mail.\n\nHowever, the department turned up its nose at that recommendation, according to what Chanin told the Voice of San Diego, and then researchers were left with the choice of whether to keep a recommendation that would have been ignored or to cut it to \u201cfoster goodwill and enable some of the other [changes] that we felt were possibilities.\u201d\n\nChanin claims that this was the only major change made in response to pressure from the city, adding that regardless of any changes made between versions, \u201cthere\u2019s clear evidence in this report that there is a difference in the way that black and brown people are treated that whites.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at the Voice of San Diego.", "keywords": ["watereddown", "san", "racial", "voice", "researchers", "profiling", "diego", "likely", "finding", "study", "language", "used", "department", "draft", "report", "removed", "findings"], "polarity": 0.08382760532150775, "subjectivity": 0.4872021609826488},

While waiting to pre-purchase tickets for Black Panther, I developed an unhealthy obsession with Fandango, and my wallet wept when the Funko POP! figures were released. I was excited to go to Wakanda, y\u2019all, and Wakanda did not disappoint.\n\nExcept for one aspect.\n\n\n\nMaybe.\n\n\n\nSee, something was revealed about the movie before its release: a missed opportunity at queer representation. Back in April, news spread of a rough cut where Okoye (Danai Gurira) and Ayo (Florence Kasumba) did a bit of flirting. Vanity Fair\u2019s Joanna Robinson had this to say:\n\n\n\nIn the rough cut of this Black Panther scene, we see Gurira\u2019s Okoye and Kasumba\u2019s Ayo swaying rhythmically back in formation with the rest of their team. Okoye eyes Ayo flirtatiously for a long time as the camera pans in on them. Eventually, she says, appreciatively and appraisingly, \u2018You look good.\u2019 Ayo responds in kind. Okoye grins and replies, \u2018I know.\u2019\n\nShortly after the story broke, Marvel reached out to say that no, their relationship was not a romantic one (as stated in the update to Robinson\u2019s article). Oh, and it turns out, the scene was cut from the film, hence the \u201cmissed opportunity\u201d commentary on every single article that pops up if you google the words \u201cBlack Panther Queer\u201d right now. Co-screenwriter Joe Robert Cole said this in an interview with Screen Crush:\n\n\n\nI think the short answer is yes. I know that there were quite a few conversations around different things, different directions with different characters, and characters that we may have. We thought, \u2018Well, maybe we\u2019ll work it this way with an arc or work it that way with an arc.\u2019 The scene you\u2019re talking about, I don\u2019t remember. I can\u2019t remember the exact exchange you\u2019re talking about, but I think it was really brief. I\u2019m not sure. I know that it was not \u2013 there wasn\u2019t some major theme through that we were looking to explore with that in terms of the story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI sat there, waiting to feel betrayed, like Santa didn\u2019t deliver the puppy I wanted, no matter how good I\u2019d been. It\u2019s an all too familiar feeling as a black, queer woman: the Hollywood game of \u201cQueerness? What\u2019s that?\u201d Some exceptions may apply, like if it\u2019s a niche movie that won\u2019t have an entire toy section dedicated to it or that one side character whose name you don\u2019t remember. And of course, there\u2019s Netflix or television (and I\u2019ve praised Black Lightning character Anissa Pierce to the heaven\u2019s above). But when it comes to those multi-million dollar box office hits? Yeah, no.\n\nSeeing Black Panther, I was fully prepared to be salty. But the salt never hit me. I went out, saw the movie, got home and ... No salt. Just pure black joy.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, then I thought, \u201cWow Bri, what kind of queer woman are you?\u201d I should\u2019ve been cursing Ryan Coogler out, swift and fast like my mama taught me when someone pisses me off. But after thinking it over, I\u2019m happy the scene didn\u2019t make it into the movie, and that feels blasphemous to admit as someone who is always championing representation\u2014especially for queer folks of color like me.\n\nBefore I explain why, let me preface it by saying two things: 1) I don\u2019t expect every queer POC to feel this way, and neither should anyone reading this. We\u2019re not some monolith that is always gonna see eye-to-eye, so don\u2019t be out here using my words to discredit someone\u2019s valid feelings. 2) People who have expressed disappointment with the scene\u2019s removal have still found joy in the movie. It doesn\u2019t make them a hypocrite, it just means that they\u2019re capable of criticizing something they love. And that\u2019s how improvement happens.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m gonna level with you, as someone who\u2019s been squinting through heteronormative romance to try and find a whisper of queerness: Okoye and Ayo flirting with each other ain\u2019t enough for me anymore. It\u2019s the bare minimum of queer representation\u2014the table scraps\u2014especially if it\u2019s two women, and especially if those two women are attractive.\n\nLet\u2019s be real: T\u2019Challa and Nakia are getting whole-ass scenes that go beyond, \u201cI looked at you, then you looked at me.\u201d That\u2019s what I want more of in my queer representation, especially considering the source material that people were referencing when discussing Okoye and Ayo: World of Wakanda. Written by Roxane Gay and Yona Harvey, this story is about Ayo and another Dora Milaje named Aneka (who doesn\u2019t appear in the movie, but people suspected Okoye had taken her place as a love interest). In the book, Ayo and Aneka are the focal points, and they\u2019re allowed to develop as both characters and lovers, with each turn of the page.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can understand the excitement of potentially including this aspect in the movie, but that breeze of commentary between Okoye and Ayo? That ain\u2019t it. A moment like that can get easily swept away as, \u201cYou\u2019re reading too much into this,\u201d or even, \u201cThat\u2019s just how women are.\u201d After all, if Katy Perry taught us anything, it\u2019s that she kissed a girl\u2014and she liked it\u2014but don\u2019t read too much into it. To do this plot justice, there\u2019d need to be multiple interactions between those women, ones that didn\u2019t solely revolve around flirtation.\n\n\n\nGIF\n\nI didn\u2019t think that was gonna happen with Black Panther. I would\u2019ve loved to see it, especially with all the time and care put into portraying Africa and black culture. But you know what else came with that clear love letter to Africa? Boycotts and plans to give negative reviews, because we\u2019re clearly trying to take over white superhero-dom.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow imagine, for a moment, the reaction if we also had queerness within this blackity-black movie. Actually, you don\u2019t have to imagine it, you can read the comments on any article that dares to complain about the scene\u2019s removal. Nothing says encouragement to implement some intersectionality like being told to let folks enjoy the damn movie without making things so \u201cpolitical\u201d\u2014even if there\u2019s already a comic featuring queer Dora Milaje.\n\n\n\nSo maybe Coogler and his crew are pacing themselves. Actress Florence Kasumba (who plays Ayo) recently spoke to Jamie Broadnax and Abraham Riesman in an interview for Vulture about it. For the record, Kasumba is here for queer Ayo, but also had this to add:\n\n\n\nThe thing is, if the makers would have wanted everyone to see the scene, it would have been in the movie. The final result that we\u2019ve seen, there were a few scenes that have been cut. Different scenes, also. They didn\u2019t make it into the movie for certain reasons, and at that point, I have to say: What their reason is, I can\u2019t tell you, because nobody told me about whether it\u2019s in or not. But at this point, I personally think people have no idea who T\u2019Challa is, who are the Wakandans, what is Wakanda, where is Wakanda, what is their culture. There are so many important things that had to be told in these two hours. So the focus was on what is so important for T\u2019Challa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI realize that all of this is a frustrating pill to swallow. And real talk: if there\u2019s any group that\u2019s used to being told, \u201cYour representation might be there later,\u201d it\u2019s queer POC. Black Panther made his first appearance back in 1966 and it took 50 years for there to be a comic based primarily on two queer characters ... and it quickly got canceled. So yeah, those disappointed reactions? Completely justified. I might want better representation before I settle on any ol\u2019 thing, but I also know that when you\u2019re starving, table scraps are savored like a full course meal.\n\nBut if there\u2019s something I want you to take away from this: it\u2019s that we\u2019re actually discussing queer women of color making a big screen appearance, and we\u2019re being taken seriously. This scene has started something, and if Coogler puts as much effort into artfully portraying queerness as he did blackness, the future movies in the series will be the most intersectional thing in any movie-verse, not just Marvel\u2019s.\n\nI never thought my cynical, eye-rolling, \u201cOf course the queer scene got cut,\u201d self would be saying this, but I think the forces behind this movie are capable of giving queer characters the respect they deserve.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019re not there yet, but I think we can be in the future.", "keywords": ["emotions", "dont", "ayo", "women", "scene", "queer", "think", "okoye", "play", "movie", "panther", "black", "representation"], "polarity": 0.12237330712101353, "subjectivity": 0.49367263725061883},

They wrote that Griffin had \u201cbeen subjected to and spoke out against the same actions that will weigh heavily in the determination of Mr. Smith\u2019s guilt or innocence.\u201d\n\n\n\nGriffin made it clear that he would not be recusing himself\u2014as multiple judges had done before him for various reasons\u2014and that the defense was wrong for trying to use his blackness to suggest that he wouldn\u2019t do his job fairly.\n\n\u201cThis is not a stop-and-search case,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cThis is a murder case.\u201d Griffin also said that the officer who stopped him was black, the Montgomery Advertiser reports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou brought race in here,\u201d Griffin told Smith\u2019s lawyer Roianne Conner. \u201cI\u2019m a black judge. I can take this black robe off, but I can\u2019t take off this black skin. I live in west Montgomery. I live in the hood. Should I recuse myself from every criminal case that has happened on the west side?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe took it very personally,\u201d Conner said.\n\nThe Death of Gregory Gunn\n\nMontgomery Police Officer Aaron Smith is charged with murder in the Feb. 25, 2016, death of Gregory Gunn, 58, a black man who was attempting to walk home without being killed by police.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Gunn\u2019s family, he was walking home from a neighbor\u2019s house\u2014where he had gone to play cards after getting off work from a local grocery store\u2014when Smith approached him.\n\nAccording to Montgomery Police Chief Ernest N. Finley, Smith spotted Gunn \u201cin an area of the city which had been the subject of a rash of burglaries and is generally known as a high-crime area\u201d and initiated a \u201cfield interview.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn other words, Smith saw a black man walking and thought he fit the description of a criminal. In a lawsuit filed by Gunn\u2019s family last summer, they insisted that Gunn was unarmed and that Smith had no reason to stop or talk to him at all.\n\nAccording to testimony from a state investigator during a preliminary hearing in March, Smith hit Gunn three times with a stun gun, beat him with a baton and shot him five times.\n\nSmith fired his weapon seven times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more about the case from AL.com:\n\n\n\nA state investigator testified at the preliminary hearing that Smith told them two versions of what happened that night. In one version Smith told investigators that during the confrontation Gunn picked up a long pole used for a paint roller and swung it at him. In the other version Smith wasn\u2019t sure if Gunn had swung a pole at him, the investigator stated. The pole also did not have Gunn\u2019s fingerprints on it, the investigator testified. Gunn was still clutching a black baseball cap in one hand when investigators arrived at the scene. A paint roller was off to one side.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSmith did not turn on his body camera, and the dashboard camera in his police cruiser was allegedly not operating.\n\nSmith was arrested and charged with murder less than a week after Gunn\u2019s killing. He was released after police officers from across the state helped him post his $150,000 bail.\n\n\n\nSmith\u2019s lawyer, and former police officer, Mickey McDermott called Smith\u2019s arrest a \u201cpolitical witch hunt\u201d and said that the Montgomery Police Department had \u201csold out a good officer\u201d who is the second generation of law enforcement in his family.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis is on the back of a 23-year-old police officer working by himself in a high crime area, with a larger man who ran,\u201d McDermott said after Smith\u2019s arrest. \u201cWe\u2019re sorry for the loss of this man, but he brought it on himself.\u201d\n\nGunn is the son of one of Montgomery\u2019s first black police officers, but McDermott didn\u2019t mention that as he went on to implicate the Movement for Black Lives in Smith\u2019s arrest.\n\n\n\n\u201cBecause of this social media culture that we\u2019re living in, [Smith] was thrown under the bus,\u201d McDermott said. \u201cI assure you we are going to stop that bus.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe case has exploded throughout the Montgomery community, which is 57 percent black. With the city\u2019s long history of white supremacist and state-sanctioned violence, mistrust of law enforcement is justifiably high. McDermott said that Smith\u2019s arrest was also a calculated move to circumvent civil unrest.\n\n\u201c[Police] have a duty to protect the public from itself sometimes,\u201d said McDermott.\n\nSmith\u2019s lawyers argued in December that the trial should be moved to another county because Montgomery had become \u201cinfested with racial prejudice and hatred\u201d toward Smith. That motion was also denied. The defense further claimed that race had been used against him as \u201cammunition,\u201d the New York Times reports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it is Smith\u2019s ammunition that left a man dead\u2014a man simply trying to get home to his family.\n\n\n\nSmith\u2019s lawyers are preparing to challenge Griffin\u2019s decision not to recuse himself in the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals, the New York Times reports.\n\nAs it stands right now, though, when Smith\u2019s still-unscheduled murder trial begins, Judge Greg Griffin will be presiding.", "keywords": ["racial", "cops", "smiths", "profiled", "judge", "murder", "black", "smith", "case", "officer", "man", "white", "montgomery", "griffin", "step", "trial", "speaking", "gunn", "policing"], "polarity": -0.030792901182511562, "subjectivity": 0.36742068177133114},

Luckily, our editor-in-chief, Danielle Belton, was able to score tickets so that we could be there to give you our impressions of the film. (Although we\u2019re not too spoilery, if you\u2019re afraid to know too much, it might be better to see the movie first.)\n\n\n\nDanielle Belton, Editor-in-Chief\n\nFor most of Black Panther, I couldn\u2019t believe what I was watching. An African nation that was never colonized? Two black women talking to each other about their mission and not, I dunno, either not talking at all or talking about a man? Moments that went on forever where no white characters spoke, or where they were summarily chastised for speaking? Black women who were fully realized characters with agency and their own beliefs? Black men who were completely confident and actualized in their ideals, even if the viewpoints were opposing and varied? A cinematic parallel for the real-world tensions and conflicts that often exist between Africans and African Americans? Black people who were the victors and not victims? What!\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat did I just watch?\u201d was all I could think after I saw it, but in a good way\u2014but also in a sad way, in that I\u2019m 40 and a lifelong movie lover who\u2019s seen almost every clich\u00e9 in cinema; but Black Panther took clich\u00e9 and chucked it off a waterfall, making me wonder why Hollywood is so lazy and often afraid of new ideas that it took this long to see a black film like this, on this scale.\n\nBut ultimately, I want to see more. I want there to be a sequel (I\u2019d love to see where things go in Wakanda after the actions of this film), but I also want there to be more blockbuster movies that take risks and tell new stories. Lastly, I want people to respect assigned seating in theaters. One dude in our theater almost ruined the entire movie because he did not want to find his ... probably crappy ... seat. But nobody has time for this game of seat leap frog. Not today.\n\n\n\nGenetta M. Adams, Managing Editor\n\nIt\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve been this hyped for a movie. And in this age when the most eager fans can line up the night before the official opening to see a movie, I\u2019ve rarely felt the urge to be among the first paying customers to see a film\u2014until now.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the splendor and beauty of Wakanda washed over me, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about what Africa would\u2019ve looked like if it had never been invaded by colonizers. What if the continent\u2019s vast riches were never stolen and the plunder of black bodies never happened? Black Panther offers the best version of that possibility.\n\n\n\nThe eye-popping fashion was even more amazing on the big screen (and if costume designer Ruth E. Carter isn\u2019t nominated for ALL the awards, I\u2019m boycotting award shows forever). And the storyline (again, the screenplay and director Ryan Coogler better be up for ALL the awards) is so timely and relevant that I actually felt empathy for the \u201cvillain\u201d Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan).\n\n\n\nAnd though the movie is called Black Panther, it is the black women of Wakanda\u2014from the fiercest warriors of the Dora Milaje to Shuri (Letitia Wright), the brilliant scientist who develops Wakanda\u2019s tech (and delivers the funniest lines in the movie), and the calm, regal beauty of Queen Mother Ramonda (Angela Bassett)\u2014who give the movie its heart. I wish my 12-year-old self could have seen such badass black women so prominently featured in a big-budget action movie. And I know that 12-year-old black girls who see the movie today will feel inspired and empowered by these black women, and encouraged to pursue their dreams, no matter what.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLook for me in the line as I hit the theater a few more times to bask in the glorious world of Wakanda.\n\n\n\nGIF\n\nAngela Helm, Contributing Editor\n\nI was hopeful but a little bit afraid of the hype surrounding Black Panther (see Empire three years ago). I shouldn\u2019t have been. It was every single thing. Big-budget action. Drama. Comic relief. And an all-encompassing, well-lit blackness that flew off the screen and overwhelmed my senses.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere will be much said about Killmonger, a complicated character who had one of the most powerful lines of the film (I gasped when he said it, and then threw a hand in the air), but what I loved most about him was that although he graduated from the Naval Academy at 19 and went to MIT, he was still so Oakland with his gold teeth and unrepentant brilliance.\n\n\n\nThe white gaze was nonexistent. This was for us, by us and quite possibly a game changer for cinema. I cannot wait for my unborn grandchildren to see it. Wakanda forever.\n\nCorey Townsend, Weekend Social Editor\n\nOne word: FASHION! The looks that were served in Black Panther sent me into a state of euphoria. The bold patterns served as a reminder that color was indeed invented for those with melanin.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe movie also served as a reminder that the world would be lost without black women!\n\nTerrell Jermaine Starr, Senior Reporter\n\nAs soon as I stepped out of the movie theater, I was no longer in Wakanda. And that made me sad. I was forced to share an UberPool with two colonizers. I wanted to yell \u201cColonizers!\u201d and ask them for their tourist visas, but I could not. We weren\u2019t in Wakanda. Nor am I Shuri. I am joking, but I\u2019m really not.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor more than two hours, I was surrounded by blackness, consumed with a power of self and possibility I\u2019d never experienced during a film. For two hours, whiteness was not centered. I was. It was challenging to wrestle with that reality and the possibilities of such a world because I was born into a reality where whiteness is the default. My struggles, my successes, my dreams are all predicated on fending off and negotiating with whiteness. In Wakanda, whiteness negotiates with me and has few options but to comply.\n\nThat is a wonderful feeling. I have never watched a Marvel film\u2014nor am I a comics fan\u2014but that has changed. Black Panther left me with a buoyancy about what our current world strives to make impossible: a world centered in blackness, our existence. There are no bells and whistles to Wakanda. It just was. For two hours, so was I. I just was.\n\nNow I am in America, where just being is a struggle. I long for Wakanda.\n\nDanielle Young, Producer\n\nThis is my second time seeing Black Panther, and it won\u2019t be my last. My emotions are not done with this movie. It not only lives up to the epic hype but also pens the only love letter to Diasporic blackness that you\u2019ll ever need. When I got a chance to watch the movie the first time, I wrote a spoiler-free review that allowed me to dig into the black pride this movie undeniably gifts you. Watching T\u2019Challa\u2019s (Chadwick Boseman) baby sister, Shuri, bounce around her lab, brilliantly leading Wakanda\u2019s tech, made me feel like a little girl watching her new role model. Representation matters, and there\u2019s nothing quite like showing little black girls and boys that tech is a possibility for them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are just so many good parts, pieces, moments, visuals, everything, but Killmonger is another standout. Obviously, Michael B. Jordan is ribbed for our pleasure, but his portrayal of a villain is delicious. His character is so well-rounded, so wounded and almost right in his attempt to dethrone King T\u2019Challa. And having his character represent black America in the sense of longing to reach home, the Motherland, was so uncomfortably beautiful. The only thing I have left to say about Black Panther is thank you for ...\u201dcolonizer.\u201d\n\nP.J. Rickards, Video Producer\n\nI\u2019ve been taking my 12-year-old son to see superhero movies for years now. It\u2019s definitely his thing: the opening, big action scenes, the one-liners, the larger-than-life graphics and the excitement after. It hit me while watching Black Panther: We\u2019re going to share that with a movie about a black superhero, strong black characters in a remarkable, all-black world. I already felt that way after seeing the trailer, but it was a whole other thing when I got to finally experience the full movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll I could think about was how he would react at certain parts and the discussions it could open up. And to see it with black people proud and dressed up. It reminded me a bit of the level of pride when Malcolm X came out and everyone was wearing X hats and dashikis. You could tell it was made with love by people of color for our people. It also made me hopeful that this will continue to be a regular occurrence, and even though it\u2019s a big deal for the grown-ups, the impact on young people growing up might be greater than we think.\n\nJason Johnson, Politics Editor\n\nI still don\u2019t know what the heck I saw, and I\u2019ve seen the movie three times. All I know is that I was fighting back thug tears every time Killmonger spoke, and this might\u2019ve been the first time in my life that I sat in a mostly black theater and people only made noise at the appropriate times. The other thing I know is this: it\u2019s Valentine\u2019s week and Black History Month, so if you bought us Black Panther tickets this weekend, we go together \u2026.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAshley Velez, Digital Video Producer\n\nBlack Panther made me feel so many things. I\u2019ve shouted \u201cWakanda forever!\u201d too many times to count since last night. Not only was Black Panther visually stunning\u2014from the cinematography to the lighting and costume design\u2014but the writing was also incredibly executed and engaging. It created space for film watchers to have meaningful dialogue surrounding things like generational trauma, conflicting methods of liberation, and identity throughout the Diaspora. Nothing about how these themes was presented felt forced, which is where modern films and television tend to drop the ball.\n\nI really appreciated the fact that Black Panther didn\u2019t feel like it solely revolved around T\u2019Challa\u2019s mental and physical conflicts. The bulk of the characters were elevated in sincere ways. Because of this, I was able to connect with multiple characters throughout the film. I still can\u2019t decide if I want to be Okoye (Danai Gurira), Nakia (Lupita Nyong\u2019o) or Shuri! That alone speaks to the significance of how black women were portrayed throughout the film.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOh yeah, listen to the soundtrack again after watching the movie! I appreciated it so much more!\n\n\n\nA final note: If you\u2019re a colonizer, I feel bad for you, son.\n\nPsych. No, I don\u2019t.\n\nAnne Branigin, News Fellow\n\nBefore the film, I kept thinking about how Black Panther came out almost a year after Get Out. Wakanda is in some ways the antithesis of \u201cthe sunken place.\u201d Where the latter expressed a loss of control\u2014being at the mercy of \u201cbenevolent\u201d whiteness\u2014Wakanda represents liberation and self-determination in a powerful way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy mother\u2019s country has been colonized twice: first by the Spanish, then by the U.S. Although one of our national heroes killed one of the world\u2019s greatest colonizers, Ferdinand Magellan, the enduring evidence of their actions is in our names, food, features, vocabulary. I love how Black Panther imagines a land written off as a Third World country as being, instead, a superpower\u2014a land free from colonization and subjugation. I love the questions it asks\u2014about what we could be if we got to keep the most precious parts of ourselves, and about the responsibility associated with that.\n\n", "keywords": ["love", "went", "thing", "live", "film", "opening", "women", "world", "night", "movie", "panther", "black", "wakanda", "watching", "forever"], "polarity": 0.11046091495310241, "subjectivity": 0.48518148518148513},

Six deputies came into Manning\u2019s home, handcuffed her boyfriend and threatened to put him in jail unless she made up a statement about her neighbor\u2019s boyfriend.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union on Monday filed a lawsuit against the Madison County (Miss.) Sheriff\u2019s Department alleging that the law enforcement agency encroached on almost every aspect of the lives of the black citizens who lived in the county, according to The Guardian.\n\nMadison County sits smack dab in the middle of Mississippi, just north of the city of Jackson. The city of Madison is 85 percent white, while the county seat of Canton is 75 percent black. It is the richest county in the state, but most of that wealth is concentrated in the white areas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the complaint filed by the ACLU, the Madison County Sheriff\u2019s Department has routinely terrorized the majority-black citizens of Canton with illegal searches, warrantless arrests and brutal violence. While 38 percent of the county\u2019s population is African American, blacks make up 78 percent of those arrested. USA Today calculated that in 2011-2012, Madison County\u2019s per capita arrest rate for blacks was more than six times the rate for whites.\n\nMuch of what the lawsuit alleges is focused on the Madison County sheriff\u2019s primary tool for targeting the black population: roadblocks. According to the suit, the county regularly sets up roadblocks outside housing projects and black businesses and in majority-black neighborhoods. The class action, civil rights suit cites the fact that between May and September, 81 percent of the people arrested at roadblocks were African American, although they make up just over a third of the people in the county.\n\nThe filing tells the story of Marvin McField, who was arrested and placed in the back of a hot car with the windows rolled up; then officers took him to another location to beat him in the head and chest.

It has nothing to do with my dislike for you or your people. In fact, some of my best friends are white. Well ... one of my best friends is white. OK, I\u2019ll be honest, all of my best friends are black, but one of them is kinda light-skinned, and when I was in the 11th grade, I went to a New Edition concert with three Caucasian classmates, so that should count for something.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut my hesitancy in penning this correspondence is based on another fact: I didn\u2019t believe you were real. I didn\u2019t discount your existence the way I don\u2019t believe in unicorns, good cops or Rihanna. (Yeah, I said it. I believe Rih Rih is a highly advanced, computer-generated image based on our collective fantasies. You might think it\u2019s crazy, but I stand by my research.)\n\nWhen people told me that there were actual individuals upset about the upcoming Marvel movie Black Panther, I thought they were exaggerating or overestimating the number. I suspect there are always a few fringe kooks who share an idiotic ideology.\n\nKyrie Irving and B.o.B think the Earth is flat. Some people believe that Donald Trump is both stable and a genius. And once, on the dance floor of a crowded nightclub, a woman told me I was handsome and cute. (At least that\u2019s what I think she said, although she may have said, \u201cYou\u2019re standing on my foot.\u201d It was pretty crowded and I\u2019d consumed a few beverages. But for the sake of this argument, let\u2019s just say it was the cute thing.) My point here is, sometimes people have wildly diverging opinions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust as I was ready to dismiss the notion that there might be more than a handful of people who disliked the notion of a Black Panther movie before they even saw it, someone sent me a transcript of Rush Limbaugh ranting about liberals embracing Black Panther.\n\nI honestly get why Limbaugh was upset. If I were a half-deaf, impotent walrus who had to sit in front of a microphone yelling to white senior citizens who still listen to AM radio while popping Oxycontin like Tic Tacs during commercial breaks, I\u2019d probably be a little jealous of T\u2019Challa, too. Plus, Limbaugh is racist, and the film does have the words \u201cBlack\u201d and \u201cPanther\u201d in it, so .... there\u2019s that.\n\nBut people kept sending me things. There was a story calling Black Panther \u201cobviously racist,\u201d a Breitbart article that called the comic book \u201cBlack Lives Matter-themed,\u201d and that piece where Ben Shapiro crumpled into a rice-paper-thin ball of fuckboy fragility in a nonsensical monologue about how this is the fault of black people, leftists and, of course, Barack Obama.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, that\u2019s only three racists people.\n\nAnd then, like a fool, I ventured into the land of white nonsense where coffee machines and Bluetooth speakers somehow have all colluded to form a plot to eradicate the great arrhythmic race: Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s Twitter,\u201d I reasoned. White people on Twitter are like the Incredible Hulk when he\u2019s off his meds: They\u2019ll get mad at anything. Then I happened upon this well-reasoned discourse between writer Zack Linly and a random Facebooker:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can understand why some white people are upset. After all, I distinctly recall how upset black people were about Harry Potter, The Lord of the Rings, When Harry Met Sally, Twilight, Terminator and The Passion of the Christ (yes, they literally made a movie about Jesus with no black people!).\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be fair, the above-mentioned movies were not comic book movies. Making a film about a superhero from an all-black place is an egregious offense. Especially since Marvel put so much detail into making sure its other superhero movies had diverse casts.\n\nI recall how the white outrage forced Hollywood into casting a South American actress to play Wonder Woman, since she was from a fictional race of Amazonian warriors. (I didn\u2019t Google it, but I\u2019m pretty sure Gal Gadot is from Brazil or somewhere. If she were Israeli or something, it would mean white people didn\u2019t care about the ethnicity of comic book characters until a black one came around and triggered their racist ... you know what? I\u2019m not even going there. She\u2019s gotta be from South America, or wypipo would look very stupid right now.) We really thank you for making sure they include black actors every time they flash back to Superman\u2019s home planet of Krypton.\n\nPlus, I\u2019m probably making up the white outcry when someone floated the idea that Donald Glover might be the next Superman, or Idris Elba could play James Bond. I probably imagined that wypipo were upset about John Boyega playing a Stormtrooper, just like I dreamed about Rihanna or that woman who thought I was handsome. (I\u2019m pretty sure she said \u201chandsome and cute,\u201d not \u201cstanding on my foot.\u201d I mean ... I was actually standing on her foot, but that\u2019s neither here nor there.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause white people have repeatedly stood up for inclusion and diversity in casting, we would like to admit that this is our fault. Forgive us for being excited that there is finally a movie that caters to our sensibilities without kowtowing to the notion of a white savior.\n\nI tell you what we\u2019ll do. To make this up to you, we promise that we will remain marginalized, mostly ancillary characters in most of the Hollywood blockbusters for the rest of the year. We also swear that we will allow you to win and be nominated for the bulk of Oscars, Golden Globes, Emmys, Tony Awards, Peabody Awards, Billboard Awards, MTV Awards, America\u2019s Got Talent, spelling bees, luge races, school shootings, mass murders, police-shooting trials, Senate races and rose ceremonies on The Bachelor.\n\nI don\u2019t want there to be any hard feelings. I know that white people have so little to celebrate in America that seeing black people smile, if only for one second, could just be the thing that breaks your brittle little racist hearts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSincerely,\n\nYour handsome and cute black friend", "keywords": ["open", "making", "im", "handsome", "upset", "white", "sure", "movie", "panther", "black", "racist", "letter"], "polarity": 0.12658975328878244, "subjectivity": 0.4967231258493393},

Carter\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 reads like a list of iconic favorites from contemporary black cinema. In the 30 years since her first film, Spike Lee\u2019s 1988 hit, School Daze, the Oscar- and Emmy-nominated costume designer has amassed more than 60 film and television credits, including I\u2019m Gonna Git You Sucka (1988); Do the Right Thing (1989); Mo\u2019 Better Blues (1990); House Party 2 (1991); Jungle Fever (1991); The Five Heartbeats (1991); Malcolm X (1992); What\u2019s Love Got to Do With It (1993); Crooklyn (1994); Clockers (1995); B*A*P*S (1997); Rosewood (1997); Amistad (1997); Love & Basketball (2000); Shaft (2000); Bamboozled (2000); Black Dynamite (2009); Sparkle (2012); The Butler (2013); Selma (2014) and Marshall (2017), not to mention Being Mary Jane and the recent reboot of Roots (2016).\n\nNow Carter is stunning us once again with her work in the most anticipated film of the year, Black Panther, her 40th film and first superhero narrative (unless you count Malcolm X). The Glow Up was blessed with the opportunity to speak with her during the flurry of publicity for this groundbreaking film while she took a rare timeout in Cape Town, South Africa. It proved a fitting setting to discuss how she helped create the fictional African country of Wakanda, and how it feels to quietly be one of the architects of black cultural collective consciousness. Ever humble, the now legendary designer told us:\n\nI always felt a responsibility to be authentic and real with depicting the culture. ... You look at enough research, you know the people. They\u2019re your relatives, they\u2019re your family. And so, collectively, when [I] look at my work, I just feel proud that I had some consistency with my approach to all of them. There was never one that I felt wasn\u2019t important for us to learn from. I was challenged each time to really get it right. ... That\u2019s kind of been my journey. And so when I look back at everything, I feel a sense of accomplishment and pride that Black Panther has kind of brought me full circle. I feel like I traveled from slavery with Roots and Amistad. And I went through the Depression with Rosewood in the \u201920s. I did Selma in the \u201950s. With Malcolm X, it was the \u201920s all the way through the \u201960s, and then I got a little \u201970s here and there with some funny ones like Black Dynamite. And then Black Panther came along, and now I\u2019m circling right back to Africa. So I actually feel like I closed the circle a little bit ... and I think they all helped to connect African history and African-American history. I\u2019m hoping for that.\n\nCarter, who has made history of her own as the first African American to be nominated for an Academy Award in costume design\u2014first for Malcolm X and again for Amistad\u2014ventured into new territory for her first Marvel film. In a stroke of luck, she learned she\u2019d gotten the job while working on Marshall, the Thurgood Marshall biopic starring future T\u2019Challa, Chadwick Boseman, directed by Black Panther comic writer Reginald Hudlin.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m like, you know how lucky is this? I get to study [Chadwick\u2019s] body; I get to ask Reggie questions about the Black Panther concept,\u201d Carter said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut even that recon couldn\u2019t fully prepare Carter for the Marvel experience, working with a team of five illustrators and a huge crew to bring the citizens of Wakanda to life. It was also the first time she had to design with movie merchandise in mind\u2014including action figures\u2014which meant that unlike Carter\u2019s previous work, many of the major costumes, like T\u2019Challa\u2019s iconic suit, were already well-defined. Instead, her role was to bring authenticity to characters that the fans of Black Panther have previously known only as illustrations, as she told The Glow Up: \u201cOnce I got the framework, we did a lot of experimentation. ... It\u2019s kind of like they gave me a coloring book and a big box of crayons.\u201d\n\nThat experimentation involved extensive research by Carter\u2019s team of four, exploring the ancient peoples of Africa\u2014including the Zulu, Maasai, Himba, Xhosa and the Turkana, which inspired the beautiful beading and neckpieces of the Dora Milaje. (Notably, Carter tries to steer clear of the word \u201ctribe\u201d because of its colonialist overtones, preferring to simply call each group of people by its name.)\n\nIn doing so, her team divided Wakanda into districts, according to a \u201cbible\u201d of sorts composed by director Ryan Coogler and production designer Hannah Beachler, that outlined both the story and layout of the fictional country. Said Carter:\n\nIt was an incredible piece of work; it was an incredible notebook that really forged us all so far ahead, because we were all working from the same nucleus ... there\u2019s different [communities] of Wakanda, and that bible that they did really outlined what parts of Wakanda were what. [For example] if you take any city, like New York, and you divide it by, you know, midtown, Brooklyn, the Village, NYU area, uptown, Columbia, Harlem, you kind of have a good sense of how Wakanda is broken up, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to Carter\u2019s core team, she also employed locals in South Africa and Ghana to search out antiques that would inspire the handmade feel she strongly felt Black Panther\u2019s costumes needed to have. Following Coogler\u2019s request that even the armor of the Dora Milaje feel like jewelry, Carter also brought on board friend and jeweler Douriean, who specializes in Afrofuturistic, hand-tooled, hand-hammered pieces, many of which have been worn by cast members during the film\u2019s premieres and press. Douriean is also the creator of Black Panther\u2019s officially licensed line of jewelry.\n\nAnd while Carter doesn\u2019t describe the experience as a seamless one, she credits Marvel for helping her realize the vision; even when some of the challenges of bringing Wakanda to life proved daunting:\n\nI had the greatest support from Marvel. The head executives, they never wavered. I never, ever felt\u2014and you know, every costume designer has at some point on a show felt like, \u201cThey\u2019re going to fire me, I know it. I\u2019m going to be fired tonight.\u201d We all go through that. And even though I may have had those thoughts, they were few and far between because I felt like I was supported 100 percent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney 1 / 15\n\nCarter is no stranger to making even the improbable possible; in her days as a student at Hampton University, she created a costume-design curriculum for herself after finding that there was nothing available to foster her budding talent. After graduation and a few opera-company internships, her HBCU experience and ingenuity came in handy when a chance meeting with director Spike Lee led to her first film, the now classic School Daze. It was the first of 14 films they\u2019d make together.\n\nBut even if she\u2019d do it all again, would she advise others to follow in her footsteps? She told The Glow Up: \u201cWell, don\u2019t do what I did, because I don\u2019t think it works today. I think that there\u2019s more avenues than I had. So I hope that my career has made some of those avenues available for other people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI always felt a responsibility to be authentic and real with depicting the culture. They\u2019re your relatives, they\u2019re your family. There was never one that I felt wasn\u2019t important for us to learn from.\n\nIf nominated for next year\u2019s Academy Award, Carter could become both the first woman ever to win for a superhero film and the first black woman to win for best costume design. But when asked if she has any reservations or resentments about primarily being hired to costume black films\u2014which make up most, but far from all, of her work\u2014she had this to say:", "keywords": ["cultural", "wannabes", "feel", "film", "marveldisney", "carter", "consciousness", "know", "theyre", "ruth", "costumes", "black", "wakanda", "panther", "felt"], "polarity": 0.2138487889520948, "subjectivity": 0.47147418697005467},

The lending data was independently confirmed and reviewed by the Associated Press and basically covered every single conventional mortgage in 2015 and 2016.\n\nThe information covered nine factors, including income, the amount of the loan, the ratio of the size of the loan to the applicant\u2019s income and the type of lender, as well as the racial makeup and median income of the neighborhood where the person wanted to buy property.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause credit-reporting agencies do not disclose how they determine credit scores, the study could not include it in their research. Banks say that credit scores are not the overwhelming factor in their lending decisions, and some studies (pdf) have shown credit scores to be discriminatory because they do not include rent, utility payments, income and cellphone bills. Besides, the investigation had access to the information that supposedly determines credit scores.\n\nHere is what they found in some major metropolitan areas:\n\nIn the Greater Atlanta area, black applicants were 2.4 times as likely to be denied a conventional home mortgage as white applicants.\n\n\n\nIn the Greater Washington, D.C.-Virginia-Maryland region, black applicants were denied 2.2 times as often as whites.\n\n\n\nLenders in Philadelphia turned away black applicants at 2.7 times the rate of white applicants.\n\n\n\nBlacks in St. Louis were denied mortgages 2.5 times as often as whites.\n\n\n\nMobile, Ala., and Greenville, N.C., were the worst. Potential black homebuyers were turned away at 5.6 times the rate of their white counterparts.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNone of this is new. JPMorgan Chase paid $55 million in January to settle charges that it discriminated against black and Latino borrowers. In 2011, Bank of America handed over $335 million for making its minority customers pay more than its white customers for the same loans. Just this past May, the city of Philadelphia filed a federal lawsuit against Wells Fargo, alleging that the bank has discriminated against black and Latino borrowers since 2004.\n\nDespite this information, financial institutions across the country continue to discriminate against black and Latino borrowers. ProPublica uncovered car insurers doing the same thing. The Wall Street Journal reported on inequities in auto loans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is the real-world economic manifestation of privilege.

We\u2019d fallen in love with the looks served alongside the lyrics, the black panthers prancing alongside Lamar, and the black excellence on full display, climaxing in that dazzling black-and-gold tableau (at the 2:59 mark) clearly created by British-Liberian artist Lina Iris Viktor in the style of her Constellations art series ... *record scratch.*\n\nOK, in homage to Viktor?\n\nUnfortunately, neither is the case, though Lamar, director Dave Meyers and their little friends\u2014I mean, \u201cthe little homies\u201d\u2014will likely claim otherwise. As revealed by the New York Times on Sunday, Viktor was unaware that her signature artistic style had been co-opted for the scene until friends began showering her with accolades for contributing to the video. [Editor\u2019s note: As of press time, Viktor could not be reached for comment. Lamar and Meyers either refused comment or did not respond to requests for comment by the Times.]\n\nAnd perhaps the imitation would\u2019ve been at least mildly flattering, except for one thing: She\u2019d already said no.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs it turns out, Viktor was purportedly contacted not once, but twice, with requests to use her art in association with Black Panther\u2014first for the film itself, and a year later to be a contributor to the artistic campaign for the film. The first offer didn\u2019t meet her financial requirements; the second would\u2019ve required her to exclusively license the work she produced to Marvel and Disney, likely putting into jeopardy an upcoming solo exhibition. Regardless, she was well within her rights to decline.\n\n\u201cWe walked away. That\u2019s the last I heard,\u201d Viktor told the New York Times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo one can only imagine her shock and anger in discovering that someone\u2014or several someones\u2014on Lamar\u2019s production team felt entitled enough to mimic her work for \u201cAll the Stars.\u201d As Viktor\u2019s lawyer Christopher Robinson told the Times: \u201cWe\u2019re in an age when \u2018no\u2019 is supposed to mean \u2018no\u2019 in whatever field you\u2019re in ... [i]t\u2019s outrageous that they\u2019re taking advantage of her.\u201d\n\nBut there are far deeper implications here, especially since Lamar and Co. are likely aware that in art, as in fashion, \u201cstyle\u201d is not protected. While clearly inspired by Viktor\u2019s work, nothing we saw in \u201cAll the Stars\u201d was a clear forgery, meaning that her recourse may be limited, but what we indisputably have here is a particularly grimy case of appropriation.\n\nIt\u2019s a bitter pill to swallow, particularly from a rapper who is widely considered perhaps the most \u201cwoke\u201d of his generation\u2014though this is not the first time he\u2019s been accused of swagger-jacking.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdding to that, what does it mean for a black male artist at the top of his career\u2014taking home five new Grammys mere weeks ago\u2014to poach from a black female artist arguably on the verge of a breakthrough in hers? What level of arrogance and cognitive dissonance does one have to have to admire someone\u2019s work, yet risk diminishing it by imitating it?\n\nCulturally, black people have become experts at calling out appropriation when we see it\u2014and occasionally been called appropriators in return. Black Panther has been no exception, whether weathering speculation about how it perpetuates stereotypes or taking criticism for not actually filming the fictional Wakanda in Africa.\n\nBut while those debates may ultimately be matters of opinion, this situation is ripe for a discussion about cultural currency, who possesses it and who feels entitled enough to wield it, regardless of who else might end up collateral damage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhy would they do this?\u201d Viktor asked the New York Times. \u201cIt\u2019s an ethical issue, because what the whole film purports is that it\u2019s about black empowerment, African excellence\u2014that\u2019s the whole concept of the story. And at the same time, they\u2019re stealing from African artists.\u201d\n\nWhile \u201cAll the Stars\u201d would arguably be less stellar without the climactic black-and-gold scene, the insistence upon appropriating Viktor\u2019s work\u2014despite her express wishes not to be involved\u2014raises deep questions about our allegiances to one another, both artistically and culturally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWere those 19 seconds worth betraying another artist? And even if and when the law doesn\u2019t protect us, shouldn\u2019t we feel the least obligation to protect\u2014or, at least, respect\u2014one another?\n\nOne can only hope that Lamar\u2019s camp finds a way to make this right with Lina Iris Viktor\u2014especially since, for us, at least, the video is now tainted by the knowledge that all of the intellectual property wasn\u2019t given willingly. But the bottom line is that Viktor deserved better\u2014and frankly, so did we.", "keywords": ["lamar", "lamars", "viktors", "kendrick", "does", "appropriator", "video", "iris", "belong", "lina", "work", "artist", "york", "black", "constellations", "viktor", "stars"], "polarity": 0.012035738882329798, "subjectivity": 0.45026748819362444},

In the past four years, the third-generation hairstylist has been making her mark on Marvel films, leading the hair departments of the last two Captain America films, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 and, now, Black Panther.\n\nOf course, the Black Panther is a unique superhero, and Black Panther is already proving to be an exceptionally unique film, as Friend tells The Glow Up:\n\nI think Black Panther is\u2014I call it a stand-alone Marvel movie, even though Marvel still has a formula. But I feel like it\u2019s a stand-alone movie, especially for me, because I\u2019m a black woman, and [to do] the first black superhero, that was really an honor, in the sense [that] we\u2019re presenting all of this to the world. We had an important job to do, and I looked at it in a whole different way, because it represents my people. So I felt like, the weight of the world on me at some points, but in the greatest way\u2014that I had the opportunity to present us in the best possible light and put something on camera that\u2019s never been [seen]. So it\u2019s a great responsibility and it\u2019s a great challenge, but it\u2019s my greatest joy in doing it, also.\n\nRepresenting her people was paramount in Friend\u2019s mind as she approached the task of helping to bring Black Panther to life. To begin, she divided the film into three elements: traditional Africa, contemporary Africa and the futuristic Africa represented by the technologically advanced civilization that is Wakanda. In her research, she drew inspiration from everything from traditional African tribes like the Maasai and Zulu to the groundbreaking fashion statements we\u2019ve seen at Afropunk celebrations around the globe.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really taking and looking at traditional styles, traditional tribal looks, and seeing what we can make into a modern style,\u201d Friend says. \u201cI like to take, like, a period hairstyle and put it in a modern movie and just put a twist on it. For me, it\u2019s still about classic hairdressing and beautiful lines and silhouettes. That\u2019s how I design hair.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFriend has certainly had her share of experience with period styles, having also headed the hair departments of Miles Ahead, The Help, Django Unchained, Rock of Ages and Dreamgirls. But whether it\u2019s long and flowing or elaborately braided and twisted, one thing you won\u2019t see in Black Panther is any straightened hair. For Friend, natural hair textures were a major part of her contribution to the visual narrative.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a beautiful time where people are wearing their natural hair,\u201d she says. \u201cI mean, there [are] women everywhere who are like, \u2018Throw the pressing comb away, throw the relaxer away. I\u2019m going to wear my natural hair.\u2019 So that whole movement of the empowerment of the hair is there,\u201d Friend explains.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCreating a diverse universe of naturally styled characters involved a team highly skilled in styling, caring for and mimicking natural hairstyles, as in the case of Angela Bassett\u2019s glorious custom-made wig of 24-inch silvery locs, inspired in equal parts by writer Toni Morrison and director Ryan Coogler\u2019s mother, Joselyn.\n\nBut while Friend isn\u2019t playing favorites on the styles she created, she\u2019s already seeing the influence this film is having on our beauty and fashion choices. She\u2019s received countless raves on the twisted crop Lupita Nyong\u2019o rocks as Dora Milaje operative Nakia and graciously provided The Glow Up with the how-to (hint: The key is keeping it close to the scalp):\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the \u2018Wakanda knot\u2019\u2014because it is different than a Bantu knot,\u201d she tells us. \u201c[Because] basically, the hair is rolled down, kind of like a cinnamon roll. And then, once the hair is dried, then, we lifted it from there.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEducating other hairstylists is a huge part of Friend\u2019s career, as her greatest hope is to see more hairstylists performing at the top of their game. That\u2019s why she created Hair Scholars, a consortium of award-winning artists led by Friend in educating and preparing aspiring stylists to be the best at their craft and ready to work in the industry.\n\nFriend knows firsthand the value of having a talented team by her side. She credits her Black Panther team for being a large part of the inspiration and craftsmanship that we\u2019ll see on-screen next week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt just felt like our brains\u2014the brainpower was just so high, and the energy was so high, just because we got to create,\u201d she says. \u201cOr somebody\u2019s like, \u2018Well, let\u2019s try this.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018Let\u2019s try it!\u2019\n\n\u201cSo it was really great to have that think tank, where we could just be in there and be creating, and just really coming up with things on the fly ... just really having the momentum just to create original pieces that are going to stand the test of time on film,\u201d she continues.\n\nAnd of course, we couldn\u2019t end our conversation without asking Friend how it felt to be on the purple carpet for Black Panther\u2019s epic premiere in Los Angeles last week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe premiere was like, you know, it was like 2018 Coming to America\u2014like, it was for real. People took it all the way,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I think what it is too, is as black people, we have like\u2014especially now\u2014there\u2019s a sense of pride. People are wearing their hair natural. People are [saying] \u2018black excellence.\u2019 People are rising to the occasion, and I think this movie comes at the time where black people, we want to step forward; we want to be recognized.\n\n\u201cThis movie hits all the right notes for having a black superhero,\u201d she explains. \u201cI mean, at the end of the day, we all want to be superheroes, in whatever we do. If we\u2019re a mom, if we\u2019re a secretary, if we\u2019re a hairdresser\u2014whatever we do, we all want to be a superhero.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up tip: If you\u2019re an Los Angeles-based hair artist, you can join Camille Friend for a Hair Scholars master class at the \u201cHair and Makeup by ... \u201d Symposium on March 11 from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.", "keywords": ["traditional", "hero", "designer", "having", "teamsupernatural", "think", "movie", "really", "panthers", "camille", "friend", "panther", "black", "natural", "meet", "hair"], "polarity": 0.17398076259489295, "subjectivity": 0.5284920634920632},

For the first 32 years of its existence, the Black Panther\u2014created by Marvel Comics legends Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in 1966\u2014had been written by whites. Christopher Priest and Hudlin, two very talented black writers, drastically changed the direction of the character when they took over his adventures in 1998 and 2005, respectively. Under their collective direction, the character\u2014the king and head priest of a Bast-worshipping, xenophobic African nation who had never been invaded by European colonialists\u2014was infused with an African-centered, self-determining ethos. In his run, Hudlin decided to shake up the Marvel fanbase by making the character a truly \u201cBlack\u201d Panther, an unapologetic African man openly opposed to white, Western supremacy.\n\n\n\nWith the Black Panther happily in vogue, I wanted to point out two important stories written by filmmaker Reginald Hudlin, the former BET executive who made that Black Panther animated miniseries in 2010.\n\n\n\nThe first story is \u201cBlack to the Future,\u201d in the first-ever Panther annual published in 2008. The plot: in one possible future, Hudlin shows one of the Panther\u2019s and Storm\u2019s sons marrying the U.S. President, the daughter of former Avengers leader Luke Cage! This story, much of it told in flashback, answers an honest, real-world question: how did Wakanda escape being colonized without going to war against the entire Western world? The answer: the Wakandans made a pact with the white European colonial powers: if you don\u2019t make war on Wakanda, Wakandans will turn a blind eye to the Trans-Atlantic slave trade and European colonialism of the rest of Africa.\n\n\n\nThe story, which balanced Wakanda\u2019s past and possible future, seemed to be a return to the serious European colonization themes of Hudlin\u2019s first story arc, \u201cWho is the Black Panther?\u201d a story which he adapted to that cartoon (and has since been novelized).\n\n\n\nThe second of Hudlin\u2019s greatest Panther stories is one of the greatest Panther stories ever. It used the idea, first developed by Christopher J. Priest (the Panther\u2019s previous writer and Marvel\u2019s first Black editor), then furthered by Hudlin, that an ancestor Panther met Captain America in Wakanda during World War II!\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCaptain America/Black Panther: Flags of Our Fathers, a 2010 mini-series drawn by Denys Cowan, the African-American artist who was one of the co-founders of Milestone Comics, expands on that story greatly. It tells a tale of white/Aryan racism and American militarism from the point of view of Gabriel Jones, the sole Black member of Sgt. Nick Fury\u2019s \u201cHowling Commandos\u201d U.S. Army Ranger squad. (This the same military unit Steve Rogers led in the first Captain America movie.)\n\n\n\nIn this story, Captain America and the Howling Commandos are sent to prod Wakanda to the side of the Allies in World War II. Azzuri, the Black Panther (T\u2019Challa\u2019s grandfather), tells the Americans that Wakanda will remain neutral. Meanwhile, the Red Skull and other Aryan supervillains under his command\u2014portrayed as unapologetic white supremacists and open racists\u2014attempt to invade Wakanda, wanting its vibranium.\n\n\n\n(Of course, America wants the vibranium, too; Fury tells Jones to spy for America and steal a sample.)\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJones, who is as impressed with Wakanda as Azzuri and the Wakandans are with him, has to decide whose side he will ultimately serve.\n\n\n\nAs a writer, Hudlin would not win any awards for subtlety. But looking at his complete body of Panther work, why he chose such a ham-fisted but potent approach was not hard to understand.\n\n\n\nHudlin clearly saw comic book writing not as a novel with pictures or a forum for deep psychological insights, but as a romp through the imagination, with the opportunity to strike pop satire notes and illustrate socio-political points. In a way, his approach was not that much different from (Panther creators) Stan Lee\u2019s and Jack Kirby\u2019s in the 1960s, before comic creators became enamored with literary pretentions. Also, Comics were not Hudlin\u2019s day job, so he could\u2014and did\u2014have fun.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn terms of public reach, Hudlin made a much greater mark on the character than anyone before him combined.\n\n\n\nHudlin not only kept the character alive in a title, but because of the digital comic/animated series that aired on BET (with a small-but-important assist from the Panther\u2019s recurring appearances on Avengers: Earth\u2019s Mightiest Heroes, the animated series which aired on the Disney XD channel from 2010 to 2013), he singlehandedly made him Black America\u2019s best-known Black superhero not named Static or Blade. Black Americans who had never gone, and perhaps never would go, into a comic book shop now knew who the Black Panther was by name; they had seen or heard about the digital comic/animated mini-series that was sold in stores, aired on BET, and, as of 2018, is still available illegally somewhere online. The fact that the Panther was unapologetically Black in that mini-series significantly added to that popularity.\n\n\n\nThe filmmaker, a huge Black comic book fanboy, did the job he set out to do: he kept Panther\u2019s A-list standing among comic book fans while making him an A-lister in the 21st century Black popular imagination, right next to 20th and early 21st-century Black fantasy male icons like John Shaft, Hawk, and Blade.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe turbo-charged Panther\u2019s coolness factor.\n\n\n\nHudlin acted in the tradition of Denny O\u2019Neil and Neal Adams\u2019s early 1970s Green Lantern/Green Arrow comic book title, in deftly combining bluntly socio-political content with action.\n\n\n\nAnd notably, with the creation (by Hudlin) of T\u2019Challa\u2019s sister, Princess Shuri, who grew into a strong, competent, grown-ass African woman warrior in her own right, he made the Panther title reflect Black feminism in a stronger way. No longer were Black women characters in Black Panther relegated to girlfriends/wives/fianc\u00e9es, kidnap victims, scorned women, sarcastic teenage sidekicks, or sexy, mostly silent bodyguards.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUntil T\u2019Challa\u2019s film debut in 2016\u2019s Captain America: Civil War, it was Hudlin\u2019s (animated) Panther that was the one most non-comic book-reading Black people knew about.\n\nCopyright 2018 by Diasporic Africa Press.\n\n", "keywords": ["america", "war", "comic", "wakanda", "book", "partly", "panthers", "panther", "black", "reginald", "hudlin", "marvel", "character", "movie"], "polarity": 0.09702287946428571, "subjectivity": 0.4092819940476186},

There is no white guy born on a distant planet who came to Kansas and discovered that he could fly. If you are ever bitten by a bat, you probably want to get a tetanus shot before making plans to build your bat cave. When I was 8, I tried to convince my cousin to let a radioactive spider (I had put it in the microwave) bite him, but for some reason he had no interest in becoming Spider-Man.\n\n\n\nAnd, of course, when black America streams into movie theaters on Feb. 15 and 16, we\u2019ll do so knowing that Black Panther has nothing to do with reality. We are well aware that there was never a hidden African country so rich that its king would have been the wealthiest man who ever existed. Sure, there were rich African countries, but the leader of the fictional land of Wakanda is supposedly so wealthy that it is impossible to calculate his wealth. Of course, it is a fictional comic book tale that could never really happen.\n\nExcept it did.\n\nIn 1324 Musa I, the 10th Mansa, or king, of the West African empire of Mali, began his 4,000-mile pilgrimage to Mecca. Before his hajj, the African and the Muslim worlds had heard little about the emperor who was uniting many parts of modern-day Mauritania and Mali (Melle), and the tale was unknown to most of Europe. But after his trip, Mansa Musa literally put the kingdom of Mali on the map, and to this very day, historians universally consider him the richest person who ever lived.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo abundant is the gold which is found in his country that he is the richest and most noble king in the land.\u201d \u2014Spanish cartographer, 1375\n\nMusa didn\u2019t gain his wealth through an internet-software startup or the stock market\u2014he got it the old-fashioned way: He earned it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe was born around 1280 as \u201cKanga Musa,\u201d a name that refers to his mother, Kankou Hamidou, in the matriarchal Mandinka society. Although his father was not a royal, Musa was appointed a \u201cdeputy\u201d to the empire and assumed the throne in 1312 when the previous king took a pilgrimage to Mecca and did not return.\n\nWhile Europe was slowly emerging from the famine, war, disease and mass poverty that killed 1 in every 10 Europeans between 1315 and 1316, Musa was building universities, mosques and city centers throughout the empire of Mali. Instead of conquering through war, he expanded his empire through annexation as he used his control of gold and salts to connect disparate city-states into one empire. It is said that by the end of his life, it would have taken an entire year to go from one end of the Mali empire to the other.\n\nBecause of this, Mansa earned more titles than a Game of Thrones character. He was called Emir of Melle, Lord of the Mines of Wangara, Conqueror of Ghanata, Lion of Mali. The only titles he never earned were Mother of Dragons and King of the North. At its height, scholars say, the kingdom had 400 densely populated cities in the Niger Delta. The University of Sankore in Timbuktu, Mali, still stands where he built it after conquering the area.\n\nWestern Europe was basically the PJs, and Mansa Musa\u2019s West African empire was the deluxe apartment in the sky.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite his immense wealth and power, very few outside of Africa knew of Mansa until his pilgrimage. Most accounts say that he took 60,000 men on his trip with him and balled out along the way, much to white people\u2019s dismay.\n\nNever one to be stingy with his money, Musa is reported to have handed out gold bars to poor people along his travel route. Almost every version of his hajj tells the same story: King Musa handed out so much gold to the poor, it actually collapsed the entire gold market in the Middle East! To use the academic terms of macroeconomics, Mansa made it rain so much in da\u2019 club, everyone else in the world look broke by comparison!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo what did he do to fix this?\n\nIn perhaps the greatest money move ever made, the king borrowed all of the gold his crew could carry from Cairo. Of course he didn\u2019t need it, but the scarcity of the precious metal settled the market. Then, like the baller he was, he simply repaid the Egyptian moneylenders back, plus interest.\n\nI\u2019m sure he also included a note that said: \u201cMy bad. I\u2019m not used to hanging out with broke people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen he returned to Mali, Musa brought back some of Spain\u2019s and Egypt\u2019s most prized architects and builders, creating an even wealthier kingdom. Historians say that by the time he returned from Mecca, he controlled most of the gold and salt in the Mediterranean. Coincidentally, this is when the kingdom of Mali began showing up on European maps.\n\nSo when you\u2019re fantasizing about a fictional African kingdom of untold fortune, remember that there was once a real king who could probably have lent T\u2019Challa a few dollars until Wakanda\u2019s vibranium check cleared the bank.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow and when Mansa Musa died is a topic of fierce debate, but in our extensive research, we could not determine whether Mansa Musa released his tax returns. We could, however, confirm that even after the death of Mansa Musa, for centuries the Mali kingdom made Western Europe look like a collection of shithole countries.", "keywords": ["musa", "mali", "african", "gold", "europe", "wealth", "empire", "kingdom", "king", "real", "wakanda", "mansa"], "polarity": 0.1177283105022831, "subjectivity": 0.409336812350511},

And then I Googled \u201cWakanda ticket prices,\u201d as if the country were real.\n\n\n\nThe short review is: Black Panther is a thing of cinematic black excellence, and the world just has to deal. It\u2019s everything you want it to be and more. I\u2019m still hype, and I screened this movie Jan. 30 and kept my mouth shut about details all this time! I think I deserve an award.\n\nI am going to try my best to wrap up my bubbling emotions (yes, still bubbling) into a cute little package for you all, just to tell you what you already know: Ryan Coogler\u2019s Black Panther is powerful enough to shift the planet. It\u2019s like Coogler grabbed everything black people talk about in barbershops, church, kitchens, cookouts and group texts and wrapped it in Wakanda magic.\n\nImagine living in a northeastern country in Africa and having the entire world see you as a developing nation, but you\u2019re literally sitting on a gold (vibranium) mine. If you\u2019re triggered, it\u2019s because, throughout this mystifying film, Coogler reminds you of how close the themes are to what\u2019s happening or has happened in the world around us. The entire continent of Africa is often perceived as developing, when, in reality, it\u2019s a rich land of kings and queens.\n\nWakanda (much like another fan favorite with a nod to the Motherland, Coming to America\u2019s Zamunda) shows off its royalty through elaborate and blatant displays. Black Panther has a strong focus on legacy\u2014who gets to be a part of it, how far a king would go to protect his country\u2014but it also explores how the entire world changes because of an unexpected shakeup of political power (cough\u2014Donald Trump\u2014cough).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack Panther is a Marvel Cinematic Universe that delivers a superhero story with heart, soul and rhythm. Black Panther confronts the conflict of being a wealthy nation refusing to disturb itself by helping the rest of the ailing world.\n\nYou can see immediately that the \u201cgood guy,\u201d T\u2019Challa, operates in a gray area. His choices are political and often clouded by his drive to protect his people. And even though the film is named for his superhero namesake and T\u2019Challa is one of the most complicated of heroes, Chadwick Boseman plays it in a way that makes room for his star-studded ensemble cast to shine bright.\n\n\n\nAnd no one shines like T\u2019Challa\u2019s little sister, Shuri (Letitia Wright). Wright is what Tiffany Haddish was to Girls Trip. Her hilarious one-liners from \u201cwhatter thooooosssee\u201d to \u201ccolonizer\u201d will have you wishing she was in every scene.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWright\u2019s Shuri works in the tech lab in the Wakanda kingdom. She\u2019s in charge of all things Black Panther. She rebels against the poised nature found in royal bloodlines and wins you over with her espressolike spunk, quick wit and mind-shattering tech talents. Shuri is a beacon for little black girls who may have been called nerds as if that were a bad thing. Watching Shuri bounce around her lab, decorated in funky paintings, walls vibrating with music, is like sharing dreams in color of all the young black girls who code.\n\n\n\nBlack Panther delivers a message of power in many forms to young black girls. Every female character in this film has an arc that makes her live long after the credits roll. Okoye (Danai Gurira) is a stunning character, but Gurira\u2019s portrayal of her makes me want to be a soldier\u2014not for America, of course\u2014for Wakanda. The Dora Milaje is a group of female soldiers devoted to T\u2019Challa\u2019s protection; they believe in their country over everything.\n\n\n\nI will not spoil it for you, but the fight scenes in which the Dora Milaje are featured will have you signing up for all kinds of self-defense courses. But it\u2019s Okoye and Nakia (Lupita Nyong\u2019o) who are the Beyonc\u00e9s of combat. As the leader of the Dora Milaje and a war dog, respectively, these women showcase a quiet inner and outer strength you\u2019d want the entire movie wrapped around. And it does.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack women are the stars here. From Okoye snatching off her own wig to Nakia using her heel as a weapon, there\u2019s no denying this ode to black women.\n\n\u201cShow them who you are.\u201d Ramonda (Angela Bassett) shouts at son T\u2019Challa during a battle for the throne. \u201cStand up. You are a king,\u201d T\u2019Challa\u2019s father, T\u2019Chaka says to him from the afterlife.\n\n\n\nThese may have been encouraging words for T\u2019Challa to dig in and fight harder, but they sank in for me. Black Panther was a full-on love letter to the Motherland, but there were also several smaller love notes to blackness throughout. Whether they were the cheers from Ramonda, or Nakia\u2019s Bantu knots, or the Wakanda dignitaries with lip plates, or Wakandans speaking isiXhosa, a South African language known for its tongue clicks, there was more than enough evidence of the appreciation and adoration for all things black in this film.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven Black Panther\u2019s villain, Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan), is someone to be proud of. Coogler uses him as a means to explore identity, legacy and the distress of black Americans.\n\n\n\nJordan\u2019s Killmonger just might be the best villain I\u2019ve seen since Heath Ledger\u2019s the Joker. You immediately think Marvel villain Ulysses Klaue is going to be who T\u2019Challa is up against, but Killmonger shuts that down quickly.\n\nKillmonger is undoubtedly scary and will end your life without a first, second or third thought, but his heart is actually in the right place. He wants to fight for the black people who are left in America\u2019s poverty and need just a taste of the riches Wakanda offers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe\u2019s the scariest villain because Killmonger actually believes in what he\u2019s doing, and, honestly, so will you. He\u2019s an advocate for black people outside of Wakanda. But we all know, black or white, Wakanda doesn\u2019t do outsiders. Without saying too much, sometimes it be your own people.\n\nKillmonger doesn\u2019t want to take Wakanda down. He wants everyone to have a piece of the kingdom\u2019s glory and is determined to make it happen by any means necessary\u2014even if that means taking down T\u2019Challa.\n\nIt\u2019s clear why Michael B. Jordan is one of Ryan Coogler\u2019s go-to stars. His range and depth are awe-inspiring. At one point, Killmonger shifts your entire morality by saying, \u201cBury me in the ocean where my ancestors jumped from ships because they knew death was better than bondage.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCoogler\u2019s genius can be seen and felt the entire time you\u2019re sitting there, thrown smack-dab into Wakanda. I get antsy after about an hour and a half during movies, but Black Panther held my attention far longer.\n\nLet\u2019s all do what we can to make sure Ryan Coogler stays protected because we need his genius. We need his storytelling and his ability to make T\u2019Challa and all of Wakanda jump off the comic book page with so much seasoning, I don\u2019t think we even deserve it.\n\nThis movie is the epitome of Issa Rae\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m rooting for everybody black.\u201d Black Panther is an entire body raised in goosebumps. It\u2019s a ride I wasn\u2019t ready for, but would gladly ride over and over again. I already know I\u2019m going to see this movie at least three more times. It\u2019s the same reason Black Panther\u2019s presale tickets have already outpaced those of any other superhero movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s about time we get to see our people in a movie like this. And this is only the beginning. We should all experience Black Panther.\n\n", "keywords": ["shuri", "killmonger", "tchalla", "blackest", "world", "good", "delivers", "superhero", "biggest", "panther", "black", "wakanda", "entire", "villain", "movie"], "polarity": 0.09222331630118515, "subjectivity": 0.47526997137652854},

It was born in the freedom movement, against the backdrop of the Watts rebellion, the rise of the Black Panther Party, the FBI\u2019s COINTELPRO and the assassination of Malcolm X (el-Hajj Malik el-Shabazz).\n\n\n\nMaulana Karenga, professor and chair of Africana studies at California State University, is often credited as the sole creator of Kwanzaa, while the collective efforts of the Us Organization\u2014a black liberation group founded in 1966 by Karenga and Malcolm X\u2019s cousin Hakim Abdullah Jamal\u2014are minimized to prop up Karenga as a revolutionary messiah of Pan-African culture.\n\nJamal ultimately ended his association with Karenga as a result of clashes over ideological and organizational differences, but Kwanzaa continued to grow in popularity despite a war, fueled by COINTELPRO, between Us and the Southern California chapter of the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense. Even without FBI interference, there was an intracommunity battle for the allegiance of young black radicals intensifying between Us and the BPP. It was the machinations of the FBI, though, that ultimately drove Us members to murder Alprentice \u201cBunchy\u201d Carter, leader of the BPP\u2019s Southern California chapter, and his comrade John Huggins on Jan. 17, 1969, on UCLA\u2019s campus.\n\nHow do we grapple with the reality that the freedom dreams of some black men do not include free black women?\n\nDespite this tramautic history\u2014or, perhaps, because of it\u2014it is important to position Kwanzaa as freedom work and not the whitewashed, often commercialized version we may see today during public school recitals. The seven principles\u2014unity (Umoja), self-determination (Kujichagulia), collective work and responsibility (Ujima), cooperative economics (Ujamaa), purpose (Nia), creativity (Kuumba) and faith (Imani)\u2014serve as a survival blueprint for black people in this nation and around the world. This is why Kwanzaa has grown so much larger than its regional origins. These seven days, for many black people, feed an ancestral need for connection to the African roots from which we were so brutally ripped.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo what happens when black men crying freedom don\u2019t adhere to their own moral compass?\n\n\n\nIn 1971, five years after Kwanzaa\u2019s founding, Karenga was convicted of felonious assault and false imprisonment for torturing two women at his Inglewood, Calif., home, crimes for which he served four to five years in prison.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Los Angeles Times reported on May 13, 1971:\n\nDeborah Jones, who once was given the Swahili title of an African queen, said she and Gail Davis were whipped with an electrical cord and beaten with a karate baton after being ordered to remove their clothes. She testified that a hot soldering iron was placed in Miss Davis\u2019 mouth and placed against Miss Davis\u2019 face and that one of her own big toes was tightened in a vise. Karenga, head of US, also put detergent and running hoses in their mouths, she said. They also were hit on the heads with toasters.\n\nKarenga has also been accused of rape by people within his community. Today, though, he seems to be too beloved or, perhaps, inconsequential for any criticism of him to matter. In 2006, Rosemary Lytle, president of the Colorado Springs NAACP branch and communications director of the ACLU Colorado, told The Gazette that she was not even aware of Karenga\u2019s past and that it didn\u2019t change her thoughts on Kwanzaa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t diminish, for me, Kwanzaa, because Kwanzaa is not based on any kind of charismatic personality or a personality of any sort, but more on community,\u201d Lytle said.\n\nThis may be true, since the creation of Kwanzaa was a collective endeavor, but the question remains: With what \u201ccommunity\u201d in mind?\n\nKarenga\u2019s history of violence against black women\u2014more specifically, the widespread willful ignorance of it\u2014is both disturbing and instructive, particularly in the #MeToo era.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen organizer and activist Tarana Burke created \u201cMe Too\u201d over a decade ago, she did so to create a safe space for black women and girls who had been victimized in their homes, in their schools and in their churches. She did it for the black women and girls who suffer in silence. She did it for black women and girls who are deemed collateral damage in the service of the so-called greater good\u2014in this context, protecting black men from the blunt force of the state by not reporting them for rape and/or abuse.\n\n\n\nWhat we see in the protection of Karenga is black women\u2019s pain, black women\u2019s bodies and black women\u2019s stories\u2014black women\u2014being thrown into the trash bin of history. Even now, though there are numerous articles discussing the charges against Karenga, some links are broken or no longer available. I\u2019m sure that in a few years, there will be fewer articles still, until all talk of Karenga\u2019s crimes will be reduced to white supremacist myth.\n\nWhen framing Pan-Africanism as a racist fail, white supremacists often use Karenga\u2019s violent past to undermine Kwanzaa\u2019s credibility\u2014and that troubles some who observe Kwanzaa. Distancing themselves from Karenga means that the racists win\u2014so how to reconcile Karenga\u2019s violence against black women with the Pan-African week of observation that he created?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore generally, how do we grapple with the reality that the freedom dreams of some black men do not include free black women?\n\n\n\nHow do we insist on modeling forward-facing movements that do not deify and protect those who would harm black women, but instead cast them out?\n\n\n\nHow do we do all of this while calling out the hypocrisy of a nation that either vilifies or whitewashes Kwanzaa because of the actions of its main architect, but will honor, with complete sincerity, the genocidal colonizers of the land on which we stand?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWriting for the Los Angeles Sentinel last week, Karenga shared that this year\u2019s Kwanzaa theme is \u201cPracticing the Principles of Kwanzaa: Repairing, Renewing and Remaking.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs old heteropatriarchal templates for movement building are being thrust aside for a movement that demands accountability for crimes against black women and the LGBTQ+ community\u2014as well as clear, unapologetic investment in the material conditions of our lives and trust in our leadership\u2014this is perfect timing for such a theme.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJohn Henrik Clarke made it clear that Karenga went to prison for \u201cmutilating black women.\u201d The Kwanzaa founder has \u201cnot atoned to the community for his attempt to destroy the Panther movement. He has not atoned for being a police informant. He has not atoned for the way he treated black women,\u201d Clarke is also quoted as saying.\n\n\n\nNot only has he not atoned, but Karenga cast himself as a political prisoner instead of owning his actions\u2014including, but not limited to, his violence against black women.\n\nPerhaps, in the spirit of Kwanzaa and this year\u2019s theme, he should start practicing there.", "keywords": ["karenga", "legacy", "freedom", "maulana", "women", "movement", "revisiting", "karengas", "atoned", "community", "men", "kwanzaa", "black"], "polarity": 0.017598967297762492, "subjectivity": 0.47006119716963085},

People who were familiar with the comics were buzzing about which iteration would be translated to the big screen and how he would fit in with other characters, such as Captain America and Iron Man. Then, in 2016, Captain America: Civil War was released into cinemas worldwide and audiences went wild, as did I.\n\nHere we had two black men who were representative of the richest and most advanced nation on Earth: the father\u2014T\u2019Chaka, the king\u2014and his son T\u2019Challa. As the plot of Civil War advanced and T\u2019Challa interacted with the other characters, one thing remained constant: T\u2019Challa was constantly shown respect and, in some instances, deference because of his position as a king. The only person who seemed to forget to whom she was speaking was Natasha, but she learned quickly enough to mind her manners. Yes, I cackled with petty glee when the Dora Milaje security chief told Natasha to \u201cmove or be moved.\u201d But I digress.\n\nAs time drew closer to the Black Panther premiere, Marvel released more trailers, and in one of the promotional featurettes that serve to give viewers insight into the world of Wakanda, I heard this: \u201cWakanda\u2019s walls have been up since its inception; it\u2019s the best-kept secret in the world because they have something the world wants.\u201d And a revelation took shape.\n\nWhen I heard it, a thought that had been sitting in the back of my mind came to the forefront: that Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) and Everett K. Ross\u2019 (Martin Freeman) intention to find a way into Wakanda and take its resources for themselves is exactly what Europeans did to Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom the moment Europeans learned to sail the open seas, they did it with one goal in mind: Conquer foreign lands and seize control of whatever resources they could get their hands on. Who cared if there were established societies with their own systems of government? They invaded, pillaged and decimated entire countries and their indigenous people, without a care for the destruction left in their wake. And it seems that this is exactly what Klaue and Ross intend to do.\n\nThey don\u2019t care that Wakanda is a sovereign nation with a thriving society that wants to be left alone. Like the English and Portuguese of yore, all Ross and Klaue care about is their own selfish need to take what they consider to be Wakanda\u2019s most vital resource, vibranium.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, the Ottoman Empire successfully prevented European travelers from making significant inroads into continental Africa, forcing them to settle for exploring the coastal regions of Western Africa, as the Portuguese did in the 1400s. Eventually the Portuguese, French, Dutch and British made their way into the African interior, but it wasn\u2019t without significant resistance from native tribes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor centuries, African nations have had to defend their right to exist because white people and nonblack people of color believed that black people were less than, and unsophisticated \u201csavages\u201d who needed ruling. But instead of finding uneducated beings, Europeans were quite surprised to find a continent that was rich in more than minerals such as gold. They found people who had created governments, trade that spanned the Eastern Hemisphere, kingdoms with grand palaces and, most important, knowledge.\n\n\n\nSimilarly to countries like Egypt and empires like the Ottoman, Wakanda is a land unlike anywhere else because it is developing technologies advanced far beyond what the world knows, and it\u2019s mostly because of a young black girl, Shuri, who is the head of technology as well as T\u2019Challa\u2019s sister. As everyone in the West looks to Tony Stark as a pinnacle of intelligence, Shuri is creating technology that would make Tony blush in shame. For goodness\u2019 sake\u2014Shuri made it so that T\u2019Challa\u2019s panther suit automatically recharges by absorbing the kinetic energy from striking bullets. Your angsty fave could neva.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s a saying that goes, \u201cThe most disrespected person in the world is a black woman,\u201d so it\u2019s quite interesting that in the MCU, the most intelligent person is a black woman. This is significant because in our society, black women are constantly denigrated while the work we accomplish is co-opted; we are insulted for our looks and fashion while nonblack people copy them without shame. And since appropriation is a trend that never seems to go out of style, we have two white men seeking to steal Shuri\u2019s technology in order to claim it as their own and turn it into a bastardized version as a means to bring destruction for their own selfish gains.\n\nLike the early colonizers who saw black people as \u201cless than\u201d simply because their skin was dark, and their hair and facial features not like white people\u2019s, Klaue and Ross see the Wakandans as people they can walk over, shoot through and push aside, simply because they don\u2019t view black people as individuals with rights and ownership of their home.\n\nInstead of approaching T\u2019Challa in peace and friendship, Klaue and Ross conspire to enter Wakanda through subterfuge so that they can learn the secrets that King T\u2019Chaka and the elders have protected for a millennium.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut like the Portuguese, Ross and Klaue will learn that black people\u2014particularly black women\u2014will fight tooth and nail to protect what\u2019s theirs. In Wakanda, there is a resisting force of warriors known as the Dora Milaje, and like Queen Nzinga of Ndongo (now known as Angola) and the legendary female Dahomean army, the Dora Milaje, led by their general, Okoye, and aided by Shuri\u2019s technology, will do what they must to protect their king and kingdom against all invaders because they have no other choice.\n\nThe way I see it, black people have always had to fight to hold on to what is rightfully ours, not only our land but our very identities. It\u2019s as though being black equates to having to struggle, especially when colonization comes into play. Even though slavery was abolished in the Caribbean and North America over 150 years ago, the impact is still felt today and affects the African Diaspora in myriad ways. One of those ways is our understanding of who we are as a people and as individuals. By that I mean knowing where we literally come from.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom an early age I knew what slavery was. I was taught about colonialism and its effects not just on Africa but also on the Caribbean. We learned that Barbados, as the easternmost island in the Caribbean chain, was the first port of call for slave ships. It was on the island that some of the most devastating and insidious characteristics of colonization were revealed.\n\nOnce the ships landed in port, those held in captivity were made to accept European names, their hair shaved and tribalwear stripped away. In essence, their very identity, along with their freedom, was stolen. Over time they were made to be ashamed of what made them distinguishable not only as Africans but also as a tribal people.\n\nA prime example of this effect was in how the slaves dressed. Gone were the colorful robes and beaded collars that identified them as belonging to a specific tribe, as well as their marital status and even age. Instead, our ancestors had to wear stiff cotton and bleached muslin. The women could no longer wear the traditional and intricate hairstyles; instead, they were forced to cover their heads in plain cloth, leading to insecurities that affect us to this day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven though the civil rights movement in the 1960s and \u201970s created an emergence of pride in and appreciation for African culture and traditions, black people in the Western world still have to contend with ignorance of our heritage from people of all walks of life and ethnicities. How often are black women insulted for the way we wear our hair, while white women are praised for being \u201ctrendy\u201d? How many stories are there about black people being snubbed for wearing traditional African clothing, only to see white models strutting down catwalks in imitations while designers like Stella McCartney get applauded?\n\nThough I\u2019ve always been proud of being black and having African ancestry, I didn\u2019t realize how much I longed to see my heritage on-screen until one Sunday night in 2017. Marvel had released the Black Panther teaser trailer, and the world, the collective black community, was shaken to our very core. And we\u2014I\u2014haven\u2019t been the same since.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Wakanda, there are people wearing their traditional garb with pride. Characters like Erik Killmonger are covered in tribal scarification, and there\u2019s an elder adorned with a lip plate as worn by the Mursi people of Ethiopia.\n\n\n\nAs someone who loves everything about film, I\u2019ve always felt bereft at not seeing enough positive representations of black people or of Africa herself in mainstream media. So the power of seeing a film of this magnitude, with the backing of one of the world\u2019s biggest film studios, centered on black people living in an \u201cAfrican\u201d nation, untouched by the destructive hands of colonizers, cannot be overstated. In one moment I realized that we, black people, were being given a major piece of the proverbial pie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo have one of the major plots of Black Panther be about a black king, his army of black women and his black sister fighting against two would-be white invaders and their goons is what I would call poetic justice. I can\u2019t wait to see the colonizers and interlopers be beaten at a game they never had a chance of winning this time.

Bleak because the president of these United States stood in front of a portrait of former President Andrew Jackson and made a joke about Pocahontas while \u201chonoring\u201d Navajo code talkers. Bleak because all of these developments happened within the past month alone.\n\n\n\nThe criminal-justice system took a hard beating this year \u2014especially at the federal level. The Department of Justice\u2019s head honcho, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, directed all federal prosecutors (pdf) to seek the harshest charges possible in every criminal case, scaled back police department investigations, bolstered civil asset forfeiture, put military-grade weapons back in the hands of local police and expanded the federal government\u2019s role in immigration enforcement. Important crime statistics \u2014 including arrest data \u2014 were stripped from the FBI\u2019s annual crime report, which is typically used to assess national trends and develop potential solutions. Police officers are still getting away with killing unarmed civilians.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, this year was one of the worst in recent memory. But what if I told you that there\u2019s reason to hope \u2014 that there is still some good to latch on to?\n\n\n\nWell, there is. Here are 11 criminal-justice victories to prove it.\n\n\n\n1. New York and North Carolina \u201craised the age.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScientists, juvenile-justice experts and courts agree that kids and teenagers are different from adults. The part of the brain associated with decision-making is still underdeveloped, which renders them immature, reckless and impulsive. They are also heavily influenced by environmental factors, including family dynamics, trauma and income instability. But children across the country are still being prosecuted as adults in federal and local courts \u2014 sometimes automatically, sometimes at the discretion of a prosecutor or judge.\n\nThis year, New York and North Carolina passed legislation to \u201craise the age\u201d and will no longer automatically prosecute 16- and 17-year-olds as adults. Instead, these teenagers can legally be processed in the juvenile-justice system, which is better equipped to assess and tackle young people\u2019s unique needs, and aims to be rehabilitative, not punitive.\n\n\n\n2. The Senate passed critical juvenile-justice legislation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWay back in 1974, the federal government passed the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act, agreeing that there should be a basic set of guidelines for approaching incarcerated youths. As outlined by the Coalition for Juvenile Justice, there were four major tenets of the legislation: Youths shouldn\u2019t be locked up with adults, they shouldn\u2019t be prosecuted as adults, they shouldn\u2019t be prosecuted for offenses that wouldn\u2019t be considered crimes if committed by adults, and there are racial disparities among detained youths that need to be reduced. With these ideas in mind, the JJDPA gave the federal government an opportunity to create a path for states and municipalities to follow \u2014 and fund them accordingly. But Congress has failed to reauthorize and update it since 2002.\n\n\n\nIn August, the Senate finally voted in favor of a bill to reauthorize the legislation, after passage of a sister bill in the House last year. Now that both houses of Congress have advanced legislation, they will hold a conference committee to consolidate the bills and send a final version to the president. But the fact that Congress is addressing JJDPA at all, after 15 years, counts as a victory.\n\n3. Some juvenile lifers were released from prisons.\n\nIn case you missed it, the Supreme Court has ruled, twice, that sentencing juveniles to life without parole is unconstitutional. In accordance with these rulings, many states have agreed to eliminate the harsh sentence, resentence those locked up before the landmark decisions and put parole back on the table.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, as Jessica Pishko wrote in The Nation, it is remarkably difficult for convicted lifers to get out of prison. Some prosecutors just push for another life sentence or another lengthy sentence, with parole as an option down the line. Waiting for a parole board to review a case can take years, and release comes with a major condition that people who claim innocence have to grapple with: an acknowledgment that they are responsible for the crime for which they\u2019ve spent a lifetime behind bars.\n\n\n\nDespite these challenges, some have made it out. There\u2019s Bobby Hines, who, at age 15, was sentenced to life without parole in Michigan for his connection to a murder. He didn\u2019t pull the trigger but has spent the last 28 years behind bars because prosecutors said he was responsible for the killing. There\u2019s Earl Rice Jr., who was 17 at the time he was locked up in a Pennsylvania prison for a robbery gone wrong. Rice has spent the past 43 years in prison because a woman he stole a purse from fell to the ground and fatally hit her head. There\u2019s also Giovanni Reid in Pennsylvania, who was found guilty of conspiracy in relation to a murder when he was 16. While the numbers are still small, these three count among dozens given another chance by the Supreme Court and states acknowledging that kids are kids.\n\n\n\n4. Thousands of convictions were dropped because of lab scandals in Massachusetts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor years, Annie Dookhan served as a drug-lab chemist, helping prosecutors build thousands of cases in Massachusetts. But by her own admission, she tampered with evidence, wrote false reports, failed to complete vital drug tests and lied about her credentials. In April, prosecutors decided to drop over 21,000 cases tied to Dookhan \u2014 many of which were prosecuted in Boston \u2014 rather than spend countless dollars and resources to retry all of them.\n\n\n\nIn November, prosecutors dismissed another 6,000 cases because of chemist Sonja Farak\u2019s illegal activity in another crime lab. In addition to tampering with evidence, Farak stole and used drugs from a lab at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and conducted most of her work over eight years while high.\n\n\n\n5. Louisiana passed a comprehensive reform package.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLouisiana has long been known as the incarceration capital of the world. In 2014 it had the highest incarceration rate, with nearly 40,000 people behind bars. Now there are about 36,000. As the state mulled over ways to fix this bleak reality, I was lucky to be one of many people to testify before the state\u2019s House Judiciary Committee about mass incarceration\u2019s disastrous impact on the population \u2014 and the whopping price tag that comes with it. In June, the legislature finally did something about the problem, passing a massive reform package to reduce the prison population by 10 percent in 10 years at the urging of Gov. John Bel Edwards.\n\n\n\nThe package includes a number of sentencing and parole reforms. Mandatory minimums were gutted for various offenses: theft, arson, drug possession and others. Judges now have more discretion to sentence violent offenders and repeat offenders. Prosecutors have more discretion to send people to diversion programs as an alternative to prison. There are no more automatic parole terms for low-level offenses, and judges can now shorten probation terms for some violent offenders and repeat offenders.\n\n\n\n6. A progressive district attorney candidate in Philadelphia won the election by a landslide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast month, Democratic candidate Larry Krasner not only won the race to become Philadelphia\u2019s next district attorney, but he won close to 75 percent of the vote. Krasner, who once called himself \u201ccompletely unelectable,\u201d has long been a thorn in the side of law enforcement. He notoriously sued Philadelphia officers for breaching civil rights 75 times. He has also spent much of his decadeslong career fighting for activists who have been criminalized by the government.\n\nHis platform was also one of the most progressive ones to date. He promised to end death penalty sentences, the prosecution of cases that involve stop-and-frisk, civil asset forfeiture and cash bail for nonviolent offenses. He vowed to treat addiction as a public health problem, to prosecute police engaged in misconduct and to protect immigrants.\n\nWith their overwhelming support, local voters declared that reform is necessary in the city with the highest incarceration rate among the 10 largest U.S. cities and rampant police abuse. The victory also continued a slow but growing national trend of prosecutorial candidates running on platforms to rethink and scale back tough-on-crime policies that have contributed to the bloated carceral population.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. New York City announced a plan to close Rikers Island.\n\nNew York City is famous for jailing thousands of criminal defendants pretrial\u2014the vast majority of whom can\u2019t afford bail \u2014 at Rikers Island. There, they face extreme violence and the rampant use of solitary confinement. Medical neglect is the norm. Many prisoners have been driven to suicide. The air is toxic.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn March, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that the facility will be shuttered over the next 10 years and replaced with a smaller jail in each of the city\u2019s five boroughs. The decision was a response to recommendations made by the Independent Commission on New York City Criminal Justice and Incarceration Reform, which was assembled in 2016 at the urging of City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito. At the time of the announcement, roughly 9,360 people were detained at the facility.\n\n\n\n8. There are more eyes on prosecutors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolice officers are easy to scrutinize for many reasons. They are the most public-facing law enforcement officials, and there is no shortage of stories about how they racially profile people, prey on marginalized groups, violate basic constitutional rights and kill. By and large, they get away with these behaviors. Considering all of this, it makes sense that activists, reporters and lawmakers have been critical of policing and have pushed for reform. But there\u2019s another group of law enforcement officials who deserve the same amount of scrutiny: local prosecutors.\n\n\n\nUnlike federal prosecutors operating under Jeff Sessions, prosecutors at the state, county and city levels have the discretion to file charges, request bail and fines and fees, establish plea deals and push for harsh sentences. While this is nothing new, more and more people are starting to understand the profound role that prosecutors play in driving mass incarceration.\n\nThe ACLU of California launched a campaign to educate voters about their local district attorneys and the policies they promote \u2014 including those that contradict what voters actually want. Journalists have also produced deep dives on prosecutors\u2019 abuses of power and misconduct, including Brady violations, the presentation of false evidence, questionable remarks made to jurors and a total lack of accountability. More eyes on these officials ultimately means that there can be a bigger push for accountability.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. Use of the death penalty is still on the decline.\n\nAccording to the Death Penalty Information Center, which tracks national execution and death penalty sentencing, there were 23 executions this year. This marks the second-lowest number of executions in the past 25 years, and the continuation of a downward trend that\u2019s lasted nearly two decades. The total number of new death sentences, 39, was historically low as well, marking the second-lowest number of new death sentences in any year since 1972. Public support for the death penalty is also the lowest it has been since that year.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese trends can be attributed to a better understanding of how flawed cases can be because of science, juror bias and shady prosecutor behavior. Executions themselves are rife with problems, including but not limited to the fact that the drugs used to execute people are manufactured in unregulated pharmacies and don\u2019t work. The costs associated with the appeals process, detention and the execution process are also astronomical.\n\n\n\n10. Poor drivers in California got some relief.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere was a time when motorists in the Golden State could have their driver\u2019s licenses suspended because they were too poor to pay traffic fines. This put them in a classic \u201cDamned if you do, damned if you don\u2019t\u201d scenario. Many people in this position still needed to drive to jobs where they earned what little money they had, at the risk of getting pulled over and accruing more tickets and fines that couldn\u2019t be paid. They still had to take kids to school. Some caught driving with a suspended license were jailed.\n\nIn June, Gov. Jerry Brown signed legislation that put a stop to these license suspensions. The legislation will also be applied retroactively. This month, Alameda County became one of the first to reverse the suspensions in accordance with the new law \u2014 a move expected to affect 54,000 drivers.\n\n\n\n11. Multiple programs are helping formerly incarcerated people rebuild.\n\nRelease from prison can be incredibly complicated. On one hand, people get their freedom back. On the other hand, former prisoners often have no money, home or support system in place to truly get back on their feet. A criminal record can also prevent them from accessing social services that they would otherwise qualify for, and hurt their chances of securing a job or getting a college degree. Buying a bus ticket can be impossible. All of these obstacles perpetuate the cycle of poverty and incarceration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut more and more programs are starting to offer vital assistance upon re-entry, and this year was full of success stories. For instance, my campaign to end mass incarceration, FREEAMERICA, helped to launch Unlocked Futures. The project will fund, offer guidance to and promote new entrepreneurial ventures by people who were once locked up.\n\nIn Los Angeles, formerly incarcerated individuals have been hired for construction jobs and given an opportunity to build up their own communities. In fact, re-entry grants for health care, treatment programs and educational programming have been awarded throughout California. In Louisiana, criminal-justice advocates established a comprehensive re-entry plan to address the needs of people impacted by the criminal-justice overhaul.\n\n\n\nThis article was published in partnership with In Justice Today.\n\nJohn Legend is a 10-time Grammy Award winner, an Academy and Tony Award winner, a philanthropist and the founder of the #FreeAmerica campaign.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCarimah Townes is a criminal-justice reporter for the Fair Punishment Project.

Newton and Bobbly Seale had a brilliant idea.\n\nInitially conceived as a way to protect the black community against the oppressive presence and indiscriminate violence of the police in Oakland, Calif., the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense evolved into a organization that advocated for revolutionary black love, mass organizing and community programs in an effort to combat the institutional racism rampant in America and around the world.\n\nThe legacy of the Panthers has been deeply impacted by the federal government\u2019s attempts to destabilize the organization. They were portrayed as violent radicals intent on overthrowing the government, but the very animal chosen as a symbol for the group sheds light on what the organizers had in mind.\n\n\u201cThe symbol of the black panther was chosen because of its nature,\u201d said Huey P. Newton in an interview. \u201cIf you strike it, it will rear back. But if the aggressor continues, the panther will strike with deadly efficiency.\u201d\n\nThis was an organization founded with an eye for self-defense.\n\nWhen most people think of racist violence in the 1960s, they think of the Ku Klux Klan in Tennessee or Bull Connor in Birmingham, Ala. What is often overlooked is the way in which the police visited violence upon black, working-class communities in the North.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey did not call you a [n\u2014ger],\u201d said former Black Panther Sherwin Forte. \u201cBut they treated you just the same as in the South.\u201d\n\nThe Black Panther Party was not an organization led and populated by upper-middle-class, black, religious elites committed to nonviolence like the leaders of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. This was an organization full of people from the communities that were hardest hit by poverty, educational inequality and economic marginalization. These were members of the community taking it upon themselves to participate in their liberation\u2014and the way the group engaged in resistance sometimes troubled civil rights leaders who were given access to political power in the 1960s. They were confrontational and unapologetic in their critiques of white supremacy. Many dressed in a way that signified black cool and displayed the beauty of African identity\u2014and they married a Marxist critique of class to a critique of race.\n\nWhite progressives often offered a critique of class that marginalized its intersection with race for people of color. This prompted W.E.B. Du Bois to write Socialism and the Negro Problem in which he argues that one can actualize progressive economic policies and leave racism intact. Addressing economic concerns, he argues, will not address the racism experienced by African Americans. Enacting progressive economic policies will not automatically fix unfair hiring practices due to implicit and explicit bias.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, many in the civil rights movement emphasized race and did not say much about class. Martin Luther King Jr. later moved into a critique of what he deemed the triple evils of militarism, racism and materialism, but many black activists working at that time emphasized race without addressing how capitalistic exploitation contributed to a unique form of oppression affecting people of color.\n\nThe Panthers addressed both. They taught Marx in their meetings and offered free meals to those who otherwise would have gone without eating. They were receptive to revolutionary ideas if those holding those ideas were willing to include race in their program. The party\u2019s willingness to self-identify as radical makes it noteworthy; yet it is the impact of black women on the party that I find most remarkable.\n\n\u201cThe irony of the Black Panthers is that the image is one of a black man and a gun,\u201d says Clayborne Carson, historian at Stanford University. \u201cBut the reality is that the majority of the rank and file at the end of the \u201960s were women.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndeed, many of the men in the party were patriarchal and held traditional, oppressive views of gender roles; however, many women in the movement were intentional about ensuring that their voices were heard and making room for the ideas of black women to be considered alongside their male counterparts. Former party Chairwoman Elaine Brown\u2019s famous saying was, \u201cWe didn\u2019t get these brothers from revolutionary heaven.\u201d\n\nDespite the U.S. government\u2019s infiltration of the movement with spies, assassination of key leaders and depiction of the party as an organization to be feared for its radicalism, the Panthers continue to inspire. They refused to apologize for loving black people and were profound in how they centered a black aesthetic and conceptual frame. Their influence can be seen in areas as diverse as free-lunch programs, African-American-studies departments and movements like the Black Lives Matter Network.\n\nThe Black Panther Party for Self-Defense was not perfect, but its members loved us\u2014and that\u2019s enough.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLawrence Ware is a progressive writer in a conservative state.

The video of the 2016 shooting was not released until after Brailsford was acquitted Thursday of second-degree murder charges.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the wake of this horrific act of state violence, there has been some outrage. Black activists, as usual, have sounded the alarm, while the #AllLivesMatter trolls have remained predictably silent. This is not unusual in the aftermath of a white person being killed by cops. We witnessed this two years ago after police officers in Louisiana killed 6-year-old Jeremy Mardis.\n\nThis time, though, there have also been passive-aggressive and intellectually dishonest statements that pass judgment on the Movement for Black Lives for not taking to the streets and protesting on Shaver\u2019s behalf.\n\nWriting for The Atlantic, Conor Friedersdorf stops just short of blaming black people for a perceived lack of mainstream media coverage surrounding Shaver\u2019s death.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDaniel Shaver\u2019s case is instructive,\u201d Friedersdorf writes. \u201cHis killing deserves more journalistic coverage as a matter of substance and more activist attention as a matter of strategy.\u201d\n\nThe author also writes that though he finds the movement \u201claudable\u201d for focusing on state violence against black people, \u201cpublicizing and protesting egregious instances of white people being killed would do as much to advance its agenda.\u201d\n\nFriedersdorf claims he believes that \u201cthe race-neutral policy reforms that the movement advances are long overdue,\u201d but in the next breath, he claims that the movement\u2019s \u201cexplicitly racial focus has been alienating to others, including those who don\u2019t believe that racism is a significant factor in police killings; those who put fighting racism low on their priority list; and anti-black racists.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe author links to Campaign Zero, founded by Brittany Packnett, Samuel Sinyangwe, DeRay Mckesson and Johnetta Elzie (who is no longer associated with Campaign Zero), as evidence of \u201cthe movement\u2019s\u201d \u201crace-neutral policy reforms.\u201d He does this even though Campaign Zero does not represent the Movement for Black Lives; even though the campaign is not associated with the Black Lives Matter Global Network in any capacity; and even though the campaign has platforms that tackle white supremacist policies, such as broken-windows policing.\n\n(Click here to read M4BL\u2019s comprehensive platform, which is unapologetically not race-neutral and calls for an end to the war on black people, reparations, political power, economic justice and community control.)\n\nFriedersdorf focuses on the benefits of so-called race neutrality, and not the movement\u2019s explicit focus on the most marginalized, targeted and oppressed communities in this country, for reasons that soon become clear.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLater in the piece, he mentions the \u201cdebate\u201d surrounding the veracity of claims that black people are disproportionately killed by police. He does this by sourcing an article from the National Review, known for being a racist publication, which claims that more black people are killed by police because more black people commit crimes.\n\nThe author doesn\u2019t want to dwell there, though, because it\u2019s \u201clargely irrelevant.\u201d\n\nNo, no, it\u2019s not.\n\nLet\u2019s make this plain: Black people are disproportionately killed by police officers in this country because they are black. That is not speculation. That is not up for debate. That is fact. It is fact that statistical analysis has shown that crime rates do not influence the rate by which police officers kill black people.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2016 the Washington Post\u2019s Wesley Lowery tackles the myth of black criminality being the root cause for increased police violence in black communities:\n\nA 2015 study by a University of California at Davis researcher concluded there was \u201cno relationship\u201d between crime rates by race and racial bias in police killings. A report released [pdf] ... by the Center for Policing Equity, which reviewed arrest and use-of-force data from 12 police departments, concluded that black residents were more often targeted for use of police force than white residents, even when adjusting for whether the person was a violent criminal. ... an independent analysis of The Post\u2019s data conducted by a team of criminal-justice researchers concluded that, when factoring in threat level, black Americans who are fatally shot by police are no more likely to be posing an imminent lethal threat to the officers at the moment they are killed than white Americans fatally shot by police.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis does not even include arrest rates.\n\nAs The Root previously reported, New York City police make more arrests in working-class black and brown communities than they do in predominantly white communities, even when officers are responding to similar 911 or 311 calls in each of those communities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack communities have been brutally and relentlessly tormented in ways that often seem unfathomable, and to even entertain the idea that police brutality and state violence are race-neutral is abhorrent. It is equally abhorrent to give such blatantly racist analysis breathing room under the guise of objectivity in order to make the point that a movement focused on the desecration of black lives must center white lives in order to be most effective.\n\nWe live in a nation where a 12-year-old child was gunned down in a police drive-by simply for playing in a park\u2014and the state insisted that he caused his own death.\n\nThe answer to that is not centering white lives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a nation built on stolen land, genocide and slavery; in a country that has lynched and incarcerated black, brown and indigenous people with impunity, the audacity of anyone to slyly reprimand black organizers, activists and journalists for not spending enough time begging white people to see their own humanity\u2014in hopes that, in turn, the protection of whiteness will blanket us all\u2014is the most condescending and ill-advised analysis that I have read in quite some time.\n\nBlack activists are fighting for an end to white supremacy, the material ways in which whiteness poisons every single thing it touches. There is absolutely no redeeming value in a racial and political construct that, by design, empowers and protects one group of people while systemically dehumanizing another.\n\nThough we are living in a political zeitgeist where liberals are negotiating with \u201cthe white working class\u201d and calling it progress, it is not our job to save white folks from the very institutions they protect and pledge their allegiance to, black lives be damned. It is not our job to create space for \u201cthose who put fighting racism low on their priority list; and anti-black racists\u201d hoping that \u201crace-neutral\u201d calls for justice will activate their humanity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe have told white people for a long, long time, that if they come for us in the morning, they will come for them in the night. We have said time and again that more white people will be collateral damage in a murderous, white supremacist system. We have warned over and over again that the house is burning, but white people continue to act shocked and awed when their loved ones are burned, and then blame black people for not abandoning their own children to bring back the hose.\n\nWhat else do they want from us?\n\nBlack people have put their lives on the line for this movement, and some have died because of it. Black journalists have lost countless hours of sleep reporting from the front lines and being arrested for doing so; some have stayed awake with tears in their eyes and rage in their hearts, amplifying through social media stories that mainstream media deemed unimportant.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack activists are suffering with post-traumatic stress disorder, unable to bear the sound of fireworks because it reminds them of the sound of rubber bullets and tear gas. Black organizers are being surveilled by the state, and some fear they will be the next Fred Hampton.\n\nThere is no room for trickle-down progressivism in this movement. To suggest that black people are better served by focusing equally on saving white lives as a matter of \u201cstrategy\u201d\u2014effectively neutralizing the movement\u2014knowing the cost of protest and the heavy toll of movement work, is to show a blatant disregard for black lives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDaniel Shaver did not deserve to die. The next Daniel Shaver will not deserve to die, either\u2014neither will the next Jeremy Mardis. It is up to white people to decide if their ignited desire for justice is greater than their apathy and, at times, hatred for black lives, because there is a movement already in progress.\n\nIt is not black people\u2019s job to create a White Lives Matter version of it to appease white sensibilities.\n\nIt is not our job to hunt for the morality within white people who would otherwise be content watching black people die.", "keywords": ["black", "raceneutral", "officers", "killed", "peoples", "white", "danielshaver", "lives", "create", "movement", "campaign", "job", "state", "matter"], "polarity": -0.045962101170434526, "subjectivity": 0.35431948452781753},

Consider the case of Jemele Hill.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nESPN suspended her earlier this week because she said in a tweet that the best way to respond to Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones\u2019 demand that all of the team\u2019s players stand during the national anthem was to go after his advertisers. Nothing gets white people\u2014especially white people in positions of extreme power\u2014angrier than going after their bag, so they went after hers.\n\nThe president of the United States found time in his busy schedule to directly attack her\u2014a black woman and a journalist who operates under the presumption of freedom of speech\u2014on Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe is not the first, and she won\u2019t be the last.\n\nThey already iced Colin Kaepernick out and took his bag, making it impossible for him to play in a league he worked so hard to get into, and he didn\u2019t even say a gotdamn thing. He simply knelt during the national anthem and explained to those who asked why he was kneeling. He wanted justice. He wanted black lives to matter.\n\nApparently that is too much to ask.\n\nThey want your Colins and your Jemeles to stop talking so loud with all their uppity learning, getting all the other darkies riled up. There\u2019s no place for that here. Just be glad you are being allowed to earn a living and stay in your place. There\u2019s no need for you to be going around causing all this trouble.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExcept we aren\u2019t the ones causing the trouble; we are simply seeking an end to it.\n\nThe shaky premise of the entire \u201cblack identity extremists\u201d narrative is that in response to the unending cycle of black lives being cut down by police who are never punished, black people will react with violence against police. This is a false-flag attack. There is data that directly contradicts this narrative. The fact is, the number of police officers killed on the job (pdf) is far lower than the number of civilians killed by police, and when police are killed by citizens, statistics suggest that it is more often by white perpetrators than black.\n\nBlack Lives Matter demonstrations are not violent. There are no torches. No one is being attacked except, usually, the demonstrators themselves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe can\u2019t talk about justice. We can\u2019t march for justice. We can\u2019t kneel for justice and we can\u2019t tweet for justice.\n\nAll of these things are being treated as extreme, when, in fact, they are not.\n\nWhat is extreme is the narrative being crafted to make black people appear as though they are somehow in the wrong for wanting the same rights and treatment as everyone else: freedom of speech, freedom of the press and equal protection under the law.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd because the internet exists, those presenting this narrative are able to get this propaganda out faster and spread it far and wide in a way they weren\u2019t able to do in the days of Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X and the original Black Panther Party.\n\nThe base they are appealing to and using this dog whistle for exists in a media vacuum. As this message gets repeated over and over again by the FBI, the alt-Reich \u201calt-right\u201d media and the president himself, it becomes a call to action for them.\n\nAnd because their ideology is being normalized, no one will be shocked or surprised when they act out in racially motivated attacks against us. Hell, no one is surprised when it happens now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey want us to appear to be the enemy on our own soil because doing so allows their white supremacist system to continue to exist. All of these acts against black people and the Movement for Black Lives are the real extremism.\n\nBut because the voices speaking out against it are largely black, no one is listening.\n\n(Shoutout to Feminista Jones by way of @N7IRL for inspiring this headline with her Twitter display name.)", "keywords": ["basic", "attack", "way", "bie", "fighting", "killed", "cant", "extremism", "human", "justice", "white", "lives", "narrative", "extreme", "isnt", "felicia", "rights", "black"], "polarity": -0.009294426747256933, "subjectivity": 0.4409625228021452},

There are also hints of infighting, people disillusioned with the movement and where it is headed, and questions about how it will be sustained and continued.\n\nOrganizers within the Movement for Black Lives took issue with that portrayal and wrote their own op-ed on Mic addressing the things said in Sands\u2019 article.\n\n\u201cThese are dangerous times for our people,\u201d they wrote. \u201cHistory tells us that we need responsible, thoughtful and brave journalism.

We must consider what we believe in, who we stand with, and what we are fighting for.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s worth reading both pieces to consider the differing opinions surrounding the movement. Those who spoke on the record with Sands echoed some of his assertions, the same assertions that Movement for Black Lives seeks to clarify.\n\nOne point that Movement for Black Lives makes clear is that just as in previous movements, there is going to be conflict; not everyone is going to agree on every point or every approach, but it\u2019s the way that conflict is handled that will dictate how far the movement can go:\n\nWe are not always in full agreement, we have competing ideas and we will undoubtedly upset each other in the process of making difficult decisions. We are here because we believe that our victories in service of black people are bigger and better when we win together.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then:\n\nAnd when we arrive at conflict, we do our best to hold each other to that standard, no matter how difficult or inconvenient.

On this day in 1886, men and women, many of them recent immigrants, organized a nationwide workers strike that led to the creation of the eight-hour workday and other basic protections for workers.\n\n\n\nThis May Day, that struggle continues as the Movement for Black Lives, wage activists and those who believe in freedom (\u201cthe Majority\u201d) join forces in support of racial, gender, immigrant, disability, queer, economic and environmental justice. This resistance goes Beyond the Moment, beyond moments of outrage, beyond narrow concepts of sanctuary and beyond barriers between communities that have much at stake and so much in common. We will strike, rally and resist. We will amplify the voices of the unheard, recognize the labor of those who are silenced and marginalized, and lift up those people in this country for whom protection has never been guaranteed.\n\nMalcolm X once said that \u201cthe most disrespected person in America is the black woman.\u201d These words, unfortunately, are still true today decades after his death. Today and every day, we center and celebrate women and femmes of the past as we stand up for the future of our communities.\n\nThe contributions and labor of black women are erased in our stories of social change, in media, in our homes and workplaces, and in our movements. We cannot value what we cannot see. The erasure of black women\u2019s work\u2014by men and white women\u2014and the rendering of that work as invisible contribute to its ongoing devaluation.\n\n\n\nDomestic work is an example of how black women\u2019s work has been devalued. Domestic work is rooted in the legacy of slavery, and today, this industry is largely made up of women of color and immigrant women. Domestic work is paid and unpaid labor that occurs inside the home, and it is the work that makes all other work possible. And yet domestic work, because it is done by black women, women of color and immigrant women, is not valued as work. It is seen as simply \u201cwhat women are supposed to do.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019ve heard that women make 77 cents to every dollar that men make, and yet few address the racial disparities in the wage gaps between women and men (pdf), as well as between women of color and white women, and between transgender and cisgender women.\n\nHistorically, Martin Luther King Jr. is often credited with leading the civil rights movement, when we know that black women like Rosa Parks, Diane Nash, Fannie Lou Hamer and Ella Baker were its backbone. This legacy, unfortunately, continues today as the work and contributions of the women of color who organized the Women\u2019s March on Washington were dismissed in favor of narratives that credited only white women for the largest mobilization in this nation\u2019s history.\n\n\n\nAs we celebrate May Day, we also observe that this day is no exception.\n\nDuring the 1886 Haymarket Uprising, a clash between thousands of workers striking for an eight-hour workday and Chicago police, Lucy Gonzales Parsons, a black, Mexican and indigenous woman, was allegedly described by a Chicago official as \u201cmore dangerous than a thousand rioters.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLucy Gonzales Parsons, firmly positioned at the center of the uprising, was one of the most dedicated and radical labor organizers this country has ever seen. She organized that famous Haymarket strike and should be considered an integral part of what we observe today as International Workers\u2019 Day\u2014but we rarely hear her name spoken in relation to the history of the labor movement in the United States. Her labor\u2014alongside the labor of millions of black women, women of color and immigrant women\u2014remains unseen and uncelebrated.\n\nUnseen and unpaid labor built and maintains the American economy\u2014an economy not only rooted in but also reliant on militaristic, anti-black, anti-worker and anti-women principles. The American economy functions because it pools the wealth of the people in the hands of the few, strategically disenfranchises black communities, and perpetuates the falsehood of a separate and inferior sphere of women\u2019s work. Its function is enforced and maintained by a hypermilitarized police force whose primary directive is to keep those in power and those with wealth safe. But, as Lucy Gonzales Parsons declared in 1890, \u201cWhen the prison, stake or scaffold can no longer silence the voice of the protesting minority, progress moves on a step, but not until then.\u201d\n\n\n\nWe are no longer the protesting minority: we are the Majority. But we will achieve no progress on any of the issues we care about and organize around if our speech is repressed by law enforcement, our bodies are imprisoned behind bars and our voices are silenced while our work is erased.

Then I layered it with my own life experience.\u201d\n\nAs for Hill\u2019s journey to this point, it\u2019s certainly been one that is unique in its own right.\n\nWith his father\u2019s untimely death due to cancer when he was 8, Hill desperately needed something to have faith in. After entering a comic book store and coming across a Batman comic that seemed to mirror his emotional weight of losing a parent, the St. Louis native found something to believe in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBruce Wayne was going through everything I was going through, but he was able to take that pain and turn it into something,\u201d Hill recalls. \u201cAs a kid, you are looking for your pathways and trying to figure out what is possible and what is impossible.

That led me to writing, and comics were always the most exciting stories you can read. I couldn\u2019t get that experience from any other forum.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter graduating from New York University film school, Hill worked as a freelance journalist before landing his first comic-writing job with Top Cow Productions in 2010. Since then, he\u2019s worked on a number of comics, including Witchblade, Postal and 7 Days From Hell.\n\nHe recognized early on that he was a black writer in a predominantly white space and needed to find a way to balance servicing the needs of readers with introducing characters of color.\n\n\u201cWhen I started writing, I knew that if you were to platform and agenda the task of writing characters of color and center them in fiction, you would have a very difficult path to be a professional,\u201d he says. \u201cEarly on, I would always balance things.

With a history of black characters being trapped in their own blackness, Hill sought to ensure that Cray was a black man with black experiences, but one who was not defined solely by those encounters.\n\n\u201cI know that as a black man, I don\u2019t wake up every day thinking about being black and filter every experience I have through a prism of race,\u201d Hill says. \u201cBut there tends to be a trend when you have characters of color that is the only thing they think about the entire time, and every conversation is governed by it.

But McKesson\u2019s lawyer asked that the case be thrown out.\n\nFrom The Advocate:\n\nBilly Gibbens, who represents DeRay Mckesson, of Baltimore, argued the suit against Mckesson should be thrown out because it makes only unsupported, speculative allegations. Donna Grodner, one of the officer\u2019s attorneys, acknowledged in court that it is not known who threw a piece of concrete at the officer, causing him to lose teeth and suffer other injuries during the July 9 protest outside Baton Rouge Police Department headquarters at the intersection of Airline Highway and Goodwood Boulevard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs previously reported on The Root, the officer, who is identified only as John Doe in the lawsuit, says that he was struck in the face by a \u201crocklike substance\u201d that was thrown at police during the July 9 protest over the death of Sterling, a black man who was shot and killed by two white police officers July 5.\n\nThe suit, which also names Black Lives Matter as a defendant, doesn\u2019t accuse Mckesson of throwing anything at officers, but says he \u201cincited the violence\u201d on behalf of Black Lives Matter.\n\nThe suit says that Mckesson \u201cwas in charge of the protests and he was seen and heard giving orders throughout the day and night of the protests.

North Carolina. Florida. My God. This is really happening.\u201d\n\nAs last night\u2019s results rolled in, I was hunkered down in a war room with colleagues. Together we watched our greatest fear, and that of millions of others around the country, be actualized in real time.\n\nMy body stiffened as state by state, vote by vote, our nation transitioned into the hands of a man who galvanized millions by activating the hateful, racist, misogynistic, sexist and xenophobic feelings residing in the hearts of so many Americans. Upon realizing it was over, I sat almost paralyzed in my chair, and surprisingly, the first thing that popped into my mind was, \u201cWe have to get the hell out of here.\u201d\n\nNow, to those who understand the gravity and tremendous danger that comes with a Donald Trump presidency and a Republican-dominated House and Senate, that sentiment would make perfect sense, especially for black and brown people. But in that moment of legitimately contemplating whether I could get my family and loved ones out of the country, I entered into immediate internal conflict with myself.\n\nShortly after that, I posted a comment on social media about getting a passport with the hashtag #WeOutOrNah? While it was admittedly clever, I wrestled with it later. In that moment, I was serious about leaving because how could I stay in a place that would elect someone like Donald Trump? But on the other hand, how could I consider leaving when I\u2019ve dedicated my life to fighting for black and brown people and those living at the margins in this country? \u201cWhat the hell kind of movement-minded, community-focused person would leave their people behind to suffer?\u201d I asked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTaking a step back, I realized that this was one of those pivotal, existential moments that come with walking in my full, unapologetic blackness. I was forcing myself to acknowledge and reckon with the complexity of my identity, and within that I came face-to-face with fears I\u2019ve refused to deal with. Not because anyone invalidated them, but because I had convinced myself that there was no room for them if I was going to really support my people, some of whom are suffering from institutional oppression in ways I can\u2019t begin to relate to personally.\n\nBut it was those repressed, suppressed fears that led to thoughts of leaving the U.S. The reality of living in a nation run by someone as deplorable and unfit as our president-elect ignited all kinds of thoughts and ideas that connected to and conflicted with my blackness and role in my community.\n\nThe black woman in me who wants to raise children in a safe environment within the next few years chirped up and said, \u201cNo way that\u2019s happening with Trump in office. Roll out.\u201d But my passion for and commitment to creating safe environments for all black and brown children, not just my own, reside with that identity, too. I\u2019ve committed to fighting in the battle to end state-sanctioned criminalization of young people of color, and to dismantle the school-to-prison pipeline. But I\u2019m afraid to stay and have kids who would live in communities filled with stop-and-frisk- and law-and-order-happy police officers who would have even less incentive to see our children as anything other than criminals and threats.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDoes being terrified of these and other things really put me at odds with who I\u2019ve committed myself to being and, more importantly, who my community needs me to be? Can I be \u201csuper woke,\u201d someone who believes that liberation must be achieved by any means necessary, and still in this moment have thoughts about a Trump-free life in Ghana?\n\nI can. And anyone else who finds him- or herself conflicted in the aftermath of the election can, too. That\u2019s the beautiful and complicated thing about black consciousness and identity. Our experiences as people of African descent in this country are so laden with struggles, triumphs, fears, hopes, nightmares and dreams deferred that there\u2019s room for any and all feelings about our existence. They may not all be right or ideal for your circumstance, and they may not be in alignment with commitments you\u2019ve made, but they\u2019re OK, and they\u2019re yours to process how you see fit.\n\nFor me and others conspiring in this fight for racial justice and equality, leaving at this moment is not the right thing to do. In essence, this is what we\u2019ve been working for; this is the moment our ancestors have prepared us for. But for others, leaving now to explore other opportunities or experiences outside the U.S. might be what\u2019s best for their well-being and that of their family. And that\u2019s fine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I firmly believe that the organizing and building we\u2019ve been doing the past few years, connected with the legacy of our ancestors, will come together now as never before. The love and the shared passion and vision we\u2019ve seen manifest is transformative, and I\u2019m supposed to stick around and help where I\u2019m needed. So in the end, I answered my own question: Nah, I\u2019m not going anywhere.\n\nChelsea Fuller is a strategic communicator working in Washington, D.C.

Masterfully produced and directed by DuVernay, it is a poignant documentary detailing white America\u2019s continual, desperate and ever-changing attempts to maintain racial and legal domination over black people.\n\nWhat has emerged as common knowledge through the Movement for Black Lives is laid out clearly and plainly in the film: Mass incarceration and modern-day policing are mutations of American slavery that mean to maintain the economic, social, political and legal subjugation of black people to support the (white) American enterprise.\n\nHailed as one of the most important films of the year, 13th evokes the eponymous 13th Amendment, which simultaneously emancipated enslaved Africans and laid the groundwork for their continued confinement and the forced extraction of labor from their bodies through convict leasing, Jim Crow and, more recently, \u201cbroken windows\u201d policing and the war on drugs. The abolition of slavery, \u201cexcept as a punishment for crime,\u201d is an insidious loophole in the 13th Amendment that provides an instructive framework from which audiences can better understand today\u2019s crisis of mass incarceration: The U.S. has less than 5 percent of the world\u2019s population and a quarter of the world\u2019s prisoners.\n\n13th boasts an impressive slate of organizers, historians, advocates, scholars and formerly incarcerated people who tell the origin story and contemporary impact of America\u2019s hypercriminalization of black people, including the power of media to create narratives about blackness that were so terrifying that even black America took up the mantle to cage and confine our kindred in the name of \u201claw and order.\u201d\n\nHowever, the film\u2019s power is tempered by a glaring omission: black women\u2019s stories.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring neither slavery nor Jim Crow nor the deceptively named war on drugs have black women been immune from the hypercriminality imposed on black people. In 2000, black women and men were incarcerated at 6 and 7.5 times (pdf) the rates of white women and men, respectively.\n\nA pivotal moment in the timeline presented by 13th is Ronald Reagan\u2019s ascendance to the presidency in 1981, when he launched his war on drugs, which was manufactured to decimate black communities and later became the foundation for Bill Clinton\u2019s 1996 doubly horrible crime bill.\n\nBut by centering the story of the criminalization squarely on black men, 13th invisibilizes the unique conditions that compound and give way to both cis and transgender black women\u2019s experiences in America at the intersections of racial and gender policing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo date, black women are the fastest-growing prison population, and this phenomenon can directly be tied into the disgraceful war on drugs that effectively criminalized people suspected of trafficking and using drugs as well as their partners, children and parents. Lest we not forget, Alberta Spruill, 57, was killed after New York City police officers broke down her door and threw a concussion grenade into her home while searching for guns and drugs that were not there.\n\n13th briefly mentions Sharanda Jones, a black woman serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole for a first-time drug offense, but her story is more common than is alluded to in the film. Black women are often swept into the carceral system either from being targeted by the war on drugs themselves or for little more than their relationship to partners who are being targeted by the state.\n\nSimilarly, when conversations about bail reform and the heartbreaking story of Kalief Browder\u2014a young black man who killed himself after being held for three years at New York City's Rikers Island jail for his inability to make bail\u2014emerged in the film, important insights into how black women are affected by the lack of access to fair bail hearings failed to be brought to light. Imagine being held in incarceration while waiting for trial because you can\u2019t make bail and being pregnant. Currently, 28 states still enforce \u201cshackling laws\u201d that require pregnant women to be \u201cshackled\u201d by the hands, feet, stomach or all three during childbirth\u2014a practice that has led to stillborn births, birth defects and maternal mortality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile 13th remembers Reagan as the chief architect of the war on drugs, many black feminists also remember him as the creator and exploiter of the \u201cwelfare queen,\u201d a mythical black woman who defrauded the government for millions through public assistance. The welfare queen, and the conservative lore that surrounded her, gave way to a massive destabilization of welfare and the criminalization of those on public assistance.\n\nYes, black men are heavily criminalized and brutalized by police aggression, but so are black women.\n\nWe cannot talk about Trayvon Martin and not mention Renisha McBride. We cannot discuss Michael Brown and not say the name of Sandra Bland. Kayla Moore and Alfred Olango are equally important to understanding how black people are affected by state violence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is critical that histories of white supremacy in America recognize that as long as there have been black women in America, the anti-blackness of the state has fashioned itself to eviscerate black women just as intentionally as it has black men.\n\nWe are more than a brief aside to black men\u2019s stories. We are, and have always been, under attack from the American carceral state. It\u2019s time to tell our stories, too. #SayOurNames.\n\nSamantha Master is a black-queer-feminist activist, educator and member of the Black Youth Project 100.

The statement closes with a solemn commitment and enduring promise to fight anti-blackness everywhere: 'We see you. We hear you. We stand with you.'\"\n\nRead the full #Arabs4BlackPower statement below:\n\n\n\nWe, the undersigned artists, academics, mothers, fathers, students, refugees, and community organizers with ties to Arabic\u00ad-speaking regions, declare our unwavering solidarity with the Movement for Black Lives (M4BL). We fully and wholeheartedly endorse the policy demands put forth by the US\u00ad-based Movement for Black Lives platform and its transnationalist vision for Black power, freedom and justice. We join you in reiterating the necessity of shared struggle and collective liberation of all oppressed and indigenous people globally. For liberation to be real and genuine, we all need to get free. The current iteration of the movement to end the war and genocide against Black people in the US is rooted in centuries of the Black freedom struggle. As we commemorate the month of Black August and its history of radical resistance, we as #Arabs4BlackPower commit to amplifying the rebellions of Black and indigenous people in the settler\u00ad-colonies of the Americas; and to joining in the fight against white supremacy, patriarchy, and hyper\u00ad-militarized late capitalism. Once again, Black people in the US are defending themselves from the violence inscribed in the Americas' settler colonialist regimes built on the backs of Indigenous, Black, and Brown people through the expropriation of indigenous lands, genocide, and slavery. Once again, Black freedom fighters are refusing colonial and imperial narratives that uphold white supremacy and are continuing to craft a language rooted in the struggle for justice. Once again, Black liberation movements are challenging systems of criminalization that dehumanize, incarcerate, and assassinate Indigenous, Black, and Brown people\u2014systems that simultaneously transcend and reinforce national boundaries through border-control complexes to terrorize people around the world under the umbrella of the global \u201cwar on terror.\u201d And once again, Black organizers in the US have put forth a vision to continue imagining and transforming these systems within and across borders. The U.S. empire violently exerts control over Indigenous, Black, and Brown communities internally and around the globe. People in predominantly Arabic\u00ad-speaking regions experience empire in locally specific material forms: bombings, drone strikes, forced disappearances, checkpoints, carceral wars, forced migration, indigenous displacement, starvation, the theft of natural resources, apartheid, and more. The geography of \u2018Ferguson to Palestine\u2019 is integral to #Arabs4BlackPower charting the structural connections, albeit different manifestations, inscribed by the US-\u00adled \u201cwar on terror.\u201d It connects anti\u00ad-Blackness as well as anti\u00ad-Muslim and anti\u00adArab racism in the US with global imperial wars in the rest of the world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe \u201cwar on terror\u201d rests on regional geopolitical alliances forged for the sole purpose of maintaining and furthering imperial and Zionist hegemony. It is situated within a genealogy of colonial legacies that have structured power in Arabic\u00adspeaking regions along the lines of gender, religion, ethnicity, skin color, language, and sexual orientation, to name a few. With these genealogies in mind, those of us struggling to rid all communities of the Maghreb and the Mashreq* from militarization and neoliberalism must center the lived experiences and aspirations of women, Black Arabs, Nubians, Imazighen, Kurds, Armenians, migrant workers, refugees, gender\u00ad-nonconforming individuals, queers, and others. We pledge to work against marginalization within our communities in all its forms and to continue examining the language we use as we continue dismantling colonial legacies. We must refuse and erase national boundaries created to divide us\u00ad\u00ad\u2014building with the oppressed from Palestine to Western Sahara, from Yemen to Syria, from Algeria to Sudan, from Tunisia to Egypt and beyond, as we come together in solidarity with the Movement for Black Lives. In pledging to resist and overcome, we as #Arabs4BlackPower unequivocally support the M4BL platform for reparations, invest\u00ad-divest, economic justice, community control and political power. We recognize, as did many before us, that only through joint struggle will we dismantle the distinct yet intersecting systems that both oppress Black and Indigenous people in the settler colonies of the Americas and institutionalize a war of terror from within US boundaries to the Mashreq, Maghreb, and beyond. To this end, we commit ourselves to combating anti\u00ad-Blackness wherever we find it in our communities\u2014both within the boundaries of the US as immigrant\u00ad-settlers complicit in white supremacy, as well as in Arabic\u00adspeaking regions where socio\u00ad-historically distinct forms of discrimination against Black Arabs intersect with other forms of marginalization along the lines of gender, religion, ethnicity, skin color, language, and sexual orientation to name a few. From Ferguson to Palestine: we will work for liberation. To everyone building towards the Movement for Black Lives: We see you. We hear you. We stand with you. **Maghreb and Mashreq are locally referenced geographies within predominantly Arabic speaking regions spanning from the Maghreb (Western Africa) to the Mashreq (Eastern Africa and Western Asia).

But the picture many saw told only one side of the story.\n\nPolice killed the woman, Korryn Gaines, and her 5-year-old son was wounded in the altercation. She had attempted to share her encounter with police using Instagram. The police urged Facebook, which owns Instagram, to deactivate her accounts. In response, Facebook cut Gaines\u2019 live stream from its feed.\n\n\n\nThis wasn\u2019t an isolated incident. In July, Diamond Reynolds used Facebook Live to record the immediate aftermath of the horrific police shooting of her boyfriend, Philando Castile. Once footage hit 1 million views, Facebook temporarily removed the video. A Facebook spokesperson claimed this was due to a \u201ctechnical glitch,\u201d but many media reports suggest otherwise.\n\nFor many, Facebook has come to represent a public square\u2014a place where we can assemble with others, share information and speak our minds. But it isn\u2019t public. It\u2019s a private platform where everyone\u2019s rights to connect and communicate are subject to Facebook\u2019s often arbitrary terms and conditions.\n\nThe Constitution protects everyone\u2019s right to record police officers in the public discharge of their duties. But this right goes only as far as your smartphone. Once people decide to share the resulting videos\u2014including those that expose shocking police abuses\u2014the potential for state and private forces to censor the footage becomes very real.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFacebook claims to take down or block videos that glorify violence and says that it will grant law-enforcement requests to suspend accounts in cases where there is an \u201cimmediate risk of harm,\u201d but that\u2019s a vague and difficult standard to apply, and one that\u2019s subject to police discretion.\n\nThe Gaines and Reynolds videos remind us that social media companies like Facebook, Google (which owns YouTube) and Twitter ultimately control our ability to share the images that have fueled the Movement for Black Lives.\n\nThe fact that these companies can arbitrarily remove our speech, images and videos has serious consequences for those struggling to expose racial injustice to a wider audience. Earlier this week, more than 40 social justice and digital-rights groups sent Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg a letter (pdf) urging the company to clarify its policy on honoring police requests to censor videos and other content.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe groups, which include the Center for Media Justice, ColorOfChange.org, Daily Kos, Free Press and SumOfUs, also asked Facebook to restore Gaines\u2019 videos from her encounter with police so the public can decide whether the police violated her rights.\n\nIn the second half of 2015, Facebook received 855 requests from government and local authorities, including local police forces, for \u201cemergency\u201d action related to users\u2019 accounts. According to Facebook, these actions included the blocking of user access to accounts as well as the handover of user information. Over that time period, the company complied with nearly 3 out of every 4 such requests.\n\nThis raises several questions: Will police demand that Facebook cover up potential abuses that witnesses have recorded and then shared on the platform, even when there is no real risk of immediate harm? And how will it respond when the risk of harm comes from police violence itself? Shouldn\u2019t our right to record such interactions with law enforcement include our right to share these recordings with others?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFacebook needs clear guidelines and processes that are transparent to users on how it determines whether to block someone\u2019s stream or deactivate an account. It shouldn\u2019t allow police to demand takedown requests to avoid scrutiny or cover up abuse. We need to know when and why Facebook and other social media platforms have granted these requests, with clear standards for the future.\n\n\u201cRisk of harm\u201d is a factor, but one could interpret that standard to justify censoring almost any interaction with law enforcement\u2014and especially those in which an interaction escalates because of a person\u2019s race.\n\nThe fight for racial equity in the media is often a fight against media monopoly, especially when these companies are white-owned and operated. And Facebook is a face of monopoly in the age of social media.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNew gatekeepers like Facebook must make confronting racism a priority. Yes, Zuckerberg has been outspoken in his support for racial justice\u2014even hanging a Black Lives Matter sign outside company headquarters. But we must urge him to ensure that his company\u2019s actions match his words. Providing clarity and accountability on Facebook\u2019s policy for suspending accounts and blocking images of police encounters is a start.\n\nThe Root aims to foster and advance conversations about issues relevant to the black Diaspora by presenting a variety of opinions from all perspectives, whether or not those opinions are shared by our editorial staff.\n\nTimothy Karr is the senior director of strategy for Free Press, a nonpartisan organization that advocates for universal access to an open and affordable internet.

However, the past few years have finally seen some cracks in the proverbial glass ceiling as black culture has permeated into the mainstream of the comic book universe. From Marvel\u2019s reimagining of classic rap album covers as comic book covers to the success of Black Lightning, Luke Cage and what is expected to be a massive bow at the box office for Black Panther, minorities in comic books are no longer a rarity in 2018.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s astounding to consider that it took this long for comic book publishers to recognize the appeal of black characters who are more than just sidekicks and henchmen. But with the buzz for Black Panther and seeing just how much a black character resonated with an audience, the door has been thrust wide open for more black characters who look, talk and act like us to be featured in this medium.\n\n\u201cRepresentation matters. The lack of representation also matters,\u201d comic book writer Bryan Edward Hill explains to The Root. \u201cStories ultimately tie back to mythology, and it\u2019s the way we rationalize good and evil. When you\u2019re not represented in stories, especially when you\u2019re not a protagonist or a hero, and you\u2019re confronted with that over and over again, subconsciously you start to question your own agency in the world.\u201d\n\nThe significance of black children and adults seeing themselves in comic books has long been undervalued by publishers. But with a diverse crop of black heroes (and anti-heroes) cropping up and finding success, films like Black Panther will hopefully become the norm and no longer outliers that we have to celebrate because we\u2019re unsure we\u2019ll ever see something like them again.\n\nHill\u2019s ongoing DC Comics series, Michael Cray, is one that will draw its fair share of attention because of the comic\u2019s unique narrative and the fact that it is written by a black man with a black title character and a black artist providing the visual element.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichael Cray is a fascinating story in which the title character is an assassin who exists in an alternate version of the DC universe and is tasked with hunting down evil versions of DC heroes, which include Arrow, the Flash and Aquaman.\n\n\u201cThe initial concept was pretty broad,\u201d Hill says of the spinoff to DC\u2019s The Wildstorm, by Warren Ellis. \u201c[Ellis] wanted me to tell a story of this guy who is in between masters and found a new organization that wanted him to take out evil versions of DC heroes. I was interested in the idea of not being able to trust your own consciousness and Cray\u2019s background as a guy who has received dogma his entire life. There\u2019s a story of a guy growing in power while simultaneously being a weapon for other people, and how those things come into conflict [is] really interesting.\u201d\n\nHill drew upon his own personal experiences as well as conversations with family and friends who had a military background to mold the personality of Cray.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI try to find real-world experience that I can insert into the work,\u201d he says. \u201cI was able to reach out to some people and get some stories about what it was like to hunt human beings for a living. From that research, I was able to paint a portrait that felt authentic to me. Then I layered it with my own life experience.\u201d\n\nAs for Hill\u2019s journey to this point, it\u2019s certainly been one that is unique in its own right.\n\nWith his father\u2019s untimely death due to cancer when he was 8, Hill desperately needed something to have faith in. After entering a comic book store and coming across a Batman comic that seemed to mirror his emotional weight of losing a parent, the St. Louis native found something to believe in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBruce Wayne was going through everything I was going through, but he was able to take that pain and turn it into something,\u201d Hill recalls. \u201cAs a kid, you are looking for your pathways and trying to figure out what is possible and what is impossible. For me, Batman became an instructive mythology on how to deal with grief, anger and all of those emotions.\u201d\n\nWith St. Louis admittedly not being a fertile ground for breeding African-American writers, Hill grew up enjoying comics but never really considered a career writing comics until later in life.\n\n\u201cI wanted to go into law enforcement,\u201d Hill reveals. \u201cI thought I was going to be an FBI agent, but my mother said, \u2018Nope, you can\u2019t have a gun so pick something else.\u2019 If I couldn\u2019t be an FBI agent, I wanted to tell stories. That led me to writing, and comics were always the most exciting stories you can read. I couldn\u2019t get that experience from any other forum.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter graduating from New York University film school, Hill worked as a freelance journalist before landing his first comic-writing job with Top Cow Productions in 2010. Since then, he\u2019s worked on a number of comics, including Witchblade, Postal and 7 Days From Hell.\n\nHe recognized early on that he was a black writer in a predominantly white space and needed to find a way to balance servicing the needs of readers with introducing characters of color.\n\n\u201cWhen I started writing, I knew that if you were to platform and agenda the task of writing characters of color and center them in fiction, you would have a very difficult path to be a professional,\u201d he says. \u201cEarly on, I would always balance things. There were less opportunities for writers of color and characters of color to be in these stories. This evolution that we\u2019ve had is a great thing. We\u2019re no longer telling a new generation what they can\u2019t do; they are growing up with a more wide-open field of participation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeing at the helm of Michael Cray has been yet another balancing act for the 40-year-old. With a history of black characters being trapped in their own blackness, Hill sought to ensure that Cray was a black man with black experiences, but one who was not defined solely by those encounters.\n\n\u201cI know that as a black man, I don\u2019t wake up every day thinking about being black and filter every experience I have through a prism of race,\u201d Hill says. \u201cBut there tends to be a trend when you have characters of color that is the only thing they think about the entire time, and every conversation is governed by it. It\u2019s just not realistic. A lot of it is well-intentioned and broadens the conversation, but a lot of it left me cold because it doesn\u2019t feel real to me.\u201d\n\nRather than force Michael Cray\u2019s blackness into every conversation he has in the comic, Hill made it a point that while his character is black, it isn\u2019t all that the story is about. After all, Michael Cray is about a man who is hunting down a twisted version of the Flash. The psychology behind that alone is worth dissecting, and Hill manages to do that while making sure the reader is never misled into thinking that Michael Cray is anything but a black man.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe have more dimensions than [just being black],\u201d Hill says while looking toward the future in a post-Black Panther world. \u201cThat is the next evolution of characters of color.

The killing sparked two weeks of protest from unarmed Black Lives Matter demonstrators carrying signs proclaiming, \"I am Mike Brown\" and \"Hands up, don\u2019t shoot.\"\n\nThey faced off against a militarized force of Ferguson police using armored vehicles and rooftop snipers. It was a visual demonstration\u2014as clear as when Birmingham, Ala., Police Chief Bull Connor turned German shepherds and water hoses on African-American schoolchildren in 1963\u2014of how far a white supremacist police structure would be willing to protect a social hierarchy that made black bodies expendable, their deaths explainable and the protests of the black community discountable.\n\nBut Ferguson was also a pivot point for Black Lives Matter, a movement that started as a hashtag, created three years prior by three black women, two of whom are queer: Alicia Garza, Patrisse Khan-Cullors and Opal Tometi. Ferguson would prove to be the catalyst for Black Lives Matter moving from being a #hashtag movement to a tangible one in the streets of America. And as it has matured, the potential for it to become the most powerful mass movement for racial justice in the 21st century is real.\n\nWatching Black Lives Matter activists in Ferguson, I knew that there would be blowback, particularly from the white community, over this direct confrontation of white police power. After all, when Black Lives Matter was formed after the acquittal of non-police officer George Zimmerman for the killing of Trayvon Martin in 2011, one of the initial reactions of many in white America was that \"All lives matter.\"\n\nBut a curious thing happened in the two years after Ferguson. More white, Asian and Latino allies began understanding, translating to their own communities and fighting alongside African Americans behind the Black Lives Matter banner. Instead of embracing intentional ignorance over the meaning of Black Lives Matter, multiracial allies owned the work of opening up a dialogue over systemic police brutality, including white bodies being killed by police lethal use of force.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOver the past two years, it\u2019s become clear that one of the genius moves by founders Garza, Tometi and Cullors was to make Black Lives Matter a grassroots, nonhierarchal and inclusive movement. Traditionally, black racial-justice movements have been primarily patriarchal and top-down\u2014from the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund as it was led by Thurgood Marshall to the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, led by Martin Luther King Jr., to the Black Panthers led by Huey Newton and Bobby Seale\u2014while hundreds of others, black women, gays and lesbians, have usually stayed in the background.\n\nBy rejecting that patriarchal model and giving power to grassroots chapters versus a main corporate headquarters, Black Lives Matter empowered women like Marissa Johnson, a Black Lives Matter activist from Seattle, to disrupt a Bernie Sanders campaign stop on the one-year anniversary of the death of Mike Brown. Her demands? That Sanders, who had, to date, couched all of his policies in economic terms, both acknowledge the Black Lives Matter movement and create policy surrounding systemic racism.\n\nDays later, Sanders hired a Black Lives Matter activist and put together a policy paper on police brutality. That one act, along with Black Lives Matter protests throughout the Democratic presidential nomination process\u2014such as when protesters confronted the eventual Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton\u2014resulted in talk about systemic racism and police brutality becoming part of the 2016 presidential campaign on the Democratic side.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Ferguson also taught us something else that should be a warning shot for those who support the Black Lives Matter movement. Since Black Lives Matter is one that intentionally goes without a leader, there are people who wish to fill the void. African-American racial-justice organizations have always been destroyed through the targeting of so-called leaders who, once neutralized, have the effect of making the organization impotent.\n\nThus, more importantly, Black Lives Matter is successful because it doesn\u2019t need a man leading it. It\u2019s a racial social-justice organization that wasn\u2019t founded by men, and yes, that\u2019s a good thing. By having black men take a step back from using our privilege to drown out the voices of black women, gays and lesbians, it allows us to see the full humanity within our community.\n\nFor example, the #SayHerName hashtag has been a subset within the Black Lives Matter movement that has addressed the reality that the reaction within the black community to black bodies being killed is not equal. When black men die at the hands of white police, black women rush to the front lines to defend the humanity of their black sons, brothers, fathers, husbands and lovers, and do it unflinchingly. On the other hand, a combination of patriarchy, misogyny and sexism has resulted in an opposite reaction from black men when police kill black women.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe names of Sandra Bland, Korryn Gaines and dozens of other black women killed by the police often get the \u201cYeah \u2026 but she wasn\u2019t perfect\u201d treatment from black men\u2014the same black men who would be outraged if being perfect were a standard that white \u201cAll Lives Matter\u201d activists imposed on their humanity. This is a standard that Mike Brown assuredly couldn\u2019t pass. And yet, having black women as leaders and not as addendums of Black Lives Matter means that we\u2019re closer to addressing the inequities within our own community that are created by patriarchy, misogyny and sexism.\n\nAnd if Black Lives Matter weren't constructed as it is, the discussion of black lives and police violence would certainly remain a binary one that would exclude the lives of black LGBT people. For example, Bayard Rustin, the chief architect of the civil rights nonviolent movement, and an openly gay black man, remained in the shadows of the civil rights movement in the 1960s, even as it was his methods that changed American society. Black Lives Matter demands that everyone has worth.\n\nOf course, not everything has gone smoothly over the past two years. There was the dangerous accusation from some in white America that being supportive of Black Lives Matter was being anti-police, which was, as Mother would say \u2026 a bold-faced lie. But as Joseph Goebbels, the notorious Nazi minister of propaganda, once said, \u201cIf you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it.\u201d Telling and retelling that lie of Black Lives Matter being anti-police was the goal of the political right in this country and, often, was part of the talking points for the police as they tried to connect any violence against the police to the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA confluence between that big lie and real-life events happened after five Dallas police officers were fatally gunned down during a peaceful Black Lives Matter march over the police killings of two black men: Philando Castile outside St. Paul, Minn., and Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, La. And when three Baton Rouge police officers were killed by a Missouri man, it seemed as if the big lie about Black Lives Matter being anti-police would destroy the organization.\n\nBut it didn\u2019t.\n\nInstead, those affiliated with Black Lives Matter gathered to create a comprehensive set of policy solutions, first with Campaign Zero last year, and now the Movement for Black Lives. For every Black Lives Matter critic who asks, \"What is the goal of Black Lives Matter?\" these campaigns lay out solutions, addressing everything from police brutality, the militarization of police and the broken-windows policies that create over-policing in black and minority communities, to independent boards to investigate police shootings. It\u2019s comprehensive, and also just the beginning. Future Black Lives Matter policy positions will take on issues like immigration reform and immigration rights.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s the sign of a maturing social movement that in just two years, Black Lives Matter has moved from the streets of Ferguson to affecting policy in this country. And like all other racial-justice movements, it, too, will morph into a more complex organization as it grows through the years. But what Black Lives Matter won\u2019t do is go away. And that\u2019s probably Mike Brown\u2019s greatest legacy: that his death helped empower a Black Lives Matter movement that will eventually prevent future Mike Browns.\n\nLawrence Ross is the author of the Los Angeles Times best-seller The Divine Nine: The History of African American Fraternities and Sororities.

However, the past few years have finally seen some cracks in the proverbial glass ceiling as black culture has permeated into the mainstream of the comic book universe. From Marvel\u2019s reimagining of classic rap album covers as comic book covers to the success of Black Lightning, Luke Cage and what is expected to be a massive bow at the box office for Black Panther, minorities in comic books are no longer a rarity in 2018.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s astounding to consider that it took this long for comic book publishers to recognize the appeal of black characters who are more than just sidekicks and henchmen. But with the buzz for Black Panther and seeing just how much a black character resonated with an audience, the door has been thrust wide open for more black characters who look, talk and act like us to be featured in this medium.\n\n\u201cRepresentation matters. The lack of representation also matters,\u201d comic book writer Bryan Edward Hill explains to The Root. \u201cStories ultimately tie back to mythology, and it\u2019s the way we rationalize good and evil. When you\u2019re not represented in stories, especially when you\u2019re not a protagonist or a hero, and you\u2019re confronted with that over and over again, subconsciously you start to question your own agency in the world.\u201d\n\nThe significance of black children and adults seeing themselves in comic books has long been undervalued by publishers. But with a diverse crop of black heroes (and anti-heroes) cropping up and finding success, films like Black Panther will hopefully become the norm and no longer outliers that we have to celebrate because we\u2019re unsure we\u2019ll ever see something like them again.\n\nHill\u2019s ongoing DC Comics series, Michael Cray, is one that will draw its fair share of attention because of the comic\u2019s unique narrative and the fact that it is written by a black man with a black title character and a black artist providing the visual element.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichael Cray is a fascinating story in which the title character is an assassin who exists in an alternate version of the DC universe and is tasked with hunting down evil versions of DC heroes, which include Arrow, the Flash and Aquaman.\n\n\u201cThe initial concept was pretty broad,\u201d Hill says of the spinoff to DC\u2019s The Wildstorm, by Warren Ellis. \u201c[Ellis] wanted me to tell a story of this guy who is in between masters and found a new organization that wanted him to take out evil versions of DC heroes. I was interested in the idea of not being able to trust your own consciousness and Cray\u2019s background as a guy who has received dogma his entire life. There\u2019s a story of a guy growing in power while simultaneously being a weapon for other people, and how those things come into conflict [is] really interesting.\u201d\n\nHill drew upon his own personal experiences as well as conversations with family and friends who had a military background to mold the personality of Cray.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI try to find real-world experience that I can insert into the work,\u201d he says. \u201cI was able to reach out to some people and get some stories about what it was like to hunt human beings for a living. From that research, I was able to paint a portrait that felt authentic to me. Then I layered it with my own life experience.\u201d\n\nAs for Hill\u2019s journey to this point, it\u2019s certainly been one that is unique in its own right.\n\nWith his father\u2019s untimely death due to cancer when he was 8, Hill desperately needed something to have faith in. After entering a comic book store and coming across a Batman comic that seemed to mirror his emotional weight of losing a parent, the St. Louis native found something to believe in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBruce Wayne was going through everything I was going through, but he was able to take that pain and turn it into something,\u201d Hill recalls. \u201cAs a kid, you are looking for your pathways and trying to figure out what is possible and what is impossible. For me, Batman became an instructive mythology on how to deal with grief, anger and all of those emotions.\u201d\n\nWith St. Louis admittedly not being a fertile ground for breeding African-American writers, Hill grew up enjoying comics but never really considered a career writing comics until later in life.\n\n\u201cI wanted to go into law enforcement,\u201d Hill reveals. \u201cI thought I was going to be an FBI agent, but my mother said, \u2018Nope, you can\u2019t have a gun so pick something else.\u2019 If I couldn\u2019t be an FBI agent, I wanted to tell stories. That led me to writing, and comics were always the most exciting stories you can read. I couldn\u2019t get that experience from any other forum.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter graduating from New York University film school, Hill worked as a freelance journalist before landing his first comic-writing job with Top Cow Productions in 2010. Since then, he\u2019s worked on a number of comics, including Witchblade, Postal and 7 Days From Hell.\n\nHe recognized early on that he was a black writer in a predominantly white space and needed to find a way to balance servicing the needs of readers with introducing characters of color.\n\n\u201cWhen I started writing, I knew that if you were to platform and agenda the task of writing characters of color and center them in fiction, you would have a very difficult path to be a professional,\u201d he says. \u201cEarly on, I would always balance things. There were less opportunities for writers of color and characters of color to be in these stories. This evolution that we\u2019ve had is a great thing. We\u2019re no longer telling a new generation what they can\u2019t do; they are growing up with a more wide-open field of participation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeing at the helm of Michael Cray has been yet another balancing act for the 40-year-old. With a history of black characters being trapped in their own blackness, Hill sought to ensure that Cray was a black man with black experiences, but one who was not defined solely by those encounters.\n\n\u201cI know that as a black man, I don\u2019t wake up every day thinking about being black and filter every experience I have through a prism of race,\u201d Hill says. \u201cBut there tends to be a trend when you have characters of color that is the only thing they think about the entire time, and every conversation is governed by it. It\u2019s just not realistic. A lot of it is well-intentioned and broadens the conversation, but a lot of it left me cold because it doesn\u2019t feel real to me.\u201d\n\nRather than force Michael Cray\u2019s blackness into every conversation he has in the comic, Hill made it a point that while his character is black, it isn\u2019t all that the story is about. After all, Michael Cray is about a man who is hunting down a twisted version of the Flash. The psychology behind that alone is worth dissecting, and Hill manages to do that while making sure the reader is never misled into thinking that Michael Cray is anything but a black man.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe have more dimensions than [just being black],\u201d Hill says while looking toward the future in a post-Black Panther world. \u201cThat is the next evolution of characters of color. Allowing them to escape the gravitational pull of the story being about their race. We have other stories to tell. Being black is an element of the story, but we don\u2019t want to make his story only about that.\u201d", "keywords": ["hill", "representation", "flash", "black", "michael", "comic", "characters", "writing", "edward", "comics", "color", "book", "writer", "kill", "explains", "cray", "matter"], "polarity": 0.05555084426353084, "subjectivity": 0.5093901434386509},

While waiting to pre-purchase tickets for Black Panther, I developed an unhealthy obsession with Fandango, and my wallet wept when the Funko POP! figures were released. I was excited to go to Wakanda, y\u2019all, and Wakanda did not disappoint.\n\nExcept for one aspect.\n\n\n\nMaybe.\n\n\n\nSee, something was revealed about the movie before its release: a missed opportunity at queer representation. Back in April, news spread of a rough cut where Okoye (Danai Gurira) and Ayo (Florence Kasumba) did a bit of flirting. Vanity Fair\u2019s Joanna Robinson had this to say:\n\n\n\nIn the rough cut of this Black Panther scene, we see Gurira\u2019s Okoye and Kasumba\u2019s Ayo swaying rhythmically back in formation with the rest of their team. Okoye eyes Ayo flirtatiously for a long time as the camera pans in on them. Eventually, she says, appreciatively and appraisingly, \u2018You look good.\u2019 Ayo responds in kind. Okoye grins and replies, \u2018I know.\u2019\n\nShortly after the story broke, Marvel reached out to say that no, their relationship was not a romantic one (as stated in the update to Robinson\u2019s article). Oh, and it turns out, the scene was cut from the film, hence the \u201cmissed opportunity\u201d commentary on every single article that pops up if you google the words \u201cBlack Panther Queer\u201d right now. Co-screenwriter Joe Robert Cole said this in an interview with Screen Crush:\n\n\n\nI think the short answer is yes. I know that there were quite a few conversations around different things, different directions with different characters, and characters that we may have. We thought, \u2018Well, maybe we\u2019ll work it this way with an arc or work it that way with an arc.\u2019 The scene you\u2019re talking about, I don\u2019t remember. I can\u2019t remember the exact exchange you\u2019re talking about, but I think it was really brief. I\u2019m not sure. I know that it was not \u2013 there wasn\u2019t some major theme through that we were looking to explore with that in terms of the story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI sat there, waiting to feel betrayed, like Santa didn\u2019t deliver the puppy I wanted, no matter how good I\u2019d been. It\u2019s an all too familiar feeling as a black, queer woman: the Hollywood game of \u201cQueerness? What\u2019s that?\u201d Some exceptions may apply, like if it\u2019s a niche movie that won\u2019t have an entire toy section dedicated to it or that one side character whose name you don\u2019t remember. And of course, there\u2019s Netflix or television (and I\u2019ve praised Black Lightning character Anissa Pierce to the heaven\u2019s above). But when it comes to those multi-million dollar box office hits? Yeah, no.\n\nSeeing Black Panther, I was fully prepared to be salty. But the salt never hit me. I went out, saw the movie, got home and ... No salt. Just pure black joy.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, then I thought, \u201cWow Bri, what kind of queer woman are you?\u201d I should\u2019ve been cursing Ryan Coogler out, swift and fast like my mama taught me when someone pisses me off. But after thinking it over, I\u2019m happy the scene didn\u2019t make it into the movie, and that feels blasphemous to admit as someone who is always championing representation\u2014especially for queer folks of color like me.\n\nBefore I explain why, let me preface it by saying two things: 1) I don\u2019t expect every queer POC to feel this way, and neither should anyone reading this. We\u2019re not some monolith that is always gonna see eye-to-eye, so don\u2019t be out here using my words to discredit someone\u2019s valid feelings. 2) People who have expressed disappointment with the scene\u2019s removal have still found joy in the movie. It doesn\u2019t make them a hypocrite, it just means that they\u2019re capable of criticizing something they love. And that\u2019s how improvement happens.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m gonna level with you, as someone who\u2019s been squinting through heteronormative romance to try and find a whisper of queerness: Okoye and Ayo flirting with each other ain\u2019t enough for me anymore. It\u2019s the bare minimum of queer representation\u2014the table scraps\u2014especially if it\u2019s two women, and especially if those two women are attractive.\n\nLet\u2019s be real: T\u2019Challa and Nakia are getting whole-ass scenes that go beyond, \u201cI looked at you, then you looked at me.\u201d That\u2019s what I want more of in my queer representation, especially considering the source material that people were referencing when discussing Okoye and Ayo: World of Wakanda. Written by Roxane Gay and Yona Harvey, this story is about Ayo and another Dora Milaje named Aneka (who doesn\u2019t appear in the movie, but people suspected Okoye had taken her place as a love interest). In the book, Ayo and Aneka are the focal points, and they\u2019re allowed to develop as both characters and lovers, with each turn of the page.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can understand the excitement of potentially including this aspect in the movie, but that breeze of commentary between Okoye and Ayo? That ain\u2019t it. A moment like that can get easily swept away as, \u201cYou\u2019re reading too much into this,\u201d or even, \u201cThat\u2019s just how women are.\u201d After all, if Katy Perry taught us anything, it\u2019s that she kissed a girl\u2014and she liked it\u2014but don\u2019t read too much into it. To do this plot justice, there\u2019d need to be multiple interactions between those women, ones that didn\u2019t solely revolve around flirtation.\n\n\n\nGIF\n\nI didn\u2019t think that was gonna happen with Black Panther. I would\u2019ve loved to see it, especially with all the time and care put into portraying Africa and black culture. But you know what else came with that clear love letter to Africa? Boycotts and plans to give negative reviews, because we\u2019re clearly trying to take over white superhero-dom.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow imagine, for a moment, the reaction if we also had queerness within this blackity-black movie. Actually, you don\u2019t have to imagine it, you can read the comments on any article that dares to complain about the scene\u2019s removal. Nothing says encouragement to implement some intersectionality like being told to let folks enjoy the damn movie without making things so \u201cpolitical\u201d\u2014even if there\u2019s already a comic featuring queer Dora Milaje.\n\n\n\nSo maybe Coogler and his crew are pacing themselves. Actress Florence Kasumba (who plays Ayo) recently spoke to Jamie Broadnax and Abraham Riesman in an interview for Vulture about it. For the record, Kasumba is here for queer Ayo, but also had this to add:\n\n\n\nThe thing is, if the makers would have wanted everyone to see the scene, it would have been in the movie. The final result that we\u2019ve seen, there were a few scenes that have been cut. Different scenes, also. They didn\u2019t make it into the movie for certain reasons, and at that point, I have to say: What their reason is, I can\u2019t tell you, because nobody told me about whether it\u2019s in or not. But at this point, I personally think people have no idea who T\u2019Challa is, who are the Wakandans, what is Wakanda, where is Wakanda, what is their culture. There are so many important things that had to be told in these two hours. So the focus was on what is so important for T\u2019Challa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI realize that all of this is a frustrating pill to swallow. And real talk: if there\u2019s any group that\u2019s used to being told, \u201cYour representation might be there later,\u201d it\u2019s queer POC. Black Panther made his first appearance back in 1966 and it took 50 years for there to be a comic based primarily on two queer characters ... and it quickly got canceled.

Like loads of other filmgoers around the country, many of them arrived early and dressed in African-inspired garb to watch the movie.\n\nThe Sun notes what 22-year-old college student Tabitha Morgan wrote in an email:\n\n\u201cI was very pumped to go see the movie. Like ever since I first seen Angela Basset styling silvery white dreads, I knew I had to go see it,\u201d she wrote. \u201cOnce we arrived in Towson and just seeing people with African print skirts, dashikis, and Black affirmation shirts, I was so excited.\u201d\n\nBut that excitement soured later in the evening when, after some delays, attendees were told that all Black Panther screenings for that night would be canceled because of technical problems. One Twitter user mentioned waiting at the theater over an hour before being told that the movie wouldn\u2019t be shown.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Jeanine Carter, a 33-year-old paralegal, told the Sun: \u201cThere was a lot of cussing. From myself and others.\u201d\n\nFilmgoers were given free movie passes for their trouble, but the event has some people scratching their heads.\n\nOne person who wrote to The Root said it was highly unlikely that the cinema would have issues with its reels, especially for a highly anticipated blockbuster that he points out had \u201csold out almost every show.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPatrick Kieley, a 31-year-old Towson native who, before working as an editor on movie trailers, worked in film distribution for five years, said that the digital cinema packages\u2014basically, the new film reels\u2014are always proofed when a theater receives them. For a blockbuster being shown on multiple screens, Kieley says, it\u2019s safe to assume that the theater would have backups.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way a large exhibitor like that would have technical issues at the last minute,\u201d Kieley said, adding that the whole thing \u201csmells really rotten.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo other film screenings were canceled, so it wasn\u2019t a theater-wide technical issue. Just any theaters / DCPs that were showing Black Panther,\u201d Keiley wrote. \u201cSeems awfully convenient.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to one Twitter user, 10 showings in total of Black Panther were canceled that evening.\n\nFurther complicating matters is a curfew, imposed in 2016, at the Towson theater and accompanying mall for unaccompanied minors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBack then, officials with the Baltimore County chapter of the NAACP raised concerns about how the curfew might discriminate against teens of color, but there was \u201cno outcry\u201d against the curfew, the Sun reports.\n\nThe curfew is enforced only on Fridays and Saturdays, which means that it would not have been in effect on Thursday, the night the Black Panther screenings were canceled. Some readers who wrote in to The Root wondered whether the lack of a curfew to enforce played into the theater\u2019s cancellation.\n\nThe Towson Cinemark employees told the Sun that all Black Panther screenings for Friday would continue as planned.", "keywords": ["eyebrows", "wrote", "theater", "canceled", "screenings", "mess", "curfew", "md", "screening", "cancellation", "movie", "told", "panther", "black", "wakanda", "towson", "raising"], "polarity": 0.005948000412286124, "subjectivity": 0.3812646876932591},

T\u2019Challa\n\nI\u2019m not saying this because I\u2019m a member, but the king would be an Alpha.

Notice his proclivity to wear no shirt with flashy, royal attire? Did you notice how his hair was ALWAYS laid\u2014even when he was fighting in water? Instead of a priceless artifact, he kept his eyes on a beautiful mask. In fact, Killmonger\u2019s entire existence in the movie was outfit-based. That nigga pretty; you read between the lines.\n\n7.

In fact, that whole damn tribe is a tribe of Que Dawgs. They never wear shirts; they enter every party by barking; they love to fight; but, at their core, they are good-hearted, loyal brothers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd, of course, the Jabari didn\u2019t care that they got kicked off the yard.\n\n8. W\u2019Kabi\n\nA royal adviser and head of security for the nation\u2019s border tribe, W\u2019Kabi is an important member of Wakanda\u2019s inner circle. He is always lurking in the background, paying close attention to events as they unfold. His loyalty to family can, at times, do more harm than good\u2014and he is awfully fond of the color blue. He would have been a Sigma.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. Zuri\n\nHe is important to the story, but he wasn\u2019t around much.

And in this age when the most eager fans can line up the night before the official opening to see a movie, I\u2019ve rarely felt the urge to be among the first paying customers to see a film\u2014until now.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the splendor and beauty of Wakanda washed over me, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about what Africa would\u2019ve looked like if it had never been invaded by colonizers. What if the continent\u2019s vast riches were never stolen and the plunder of black bodies never happened? Black Panther offers the best version of that possibility.\n\n\n\nThe eye-popping fashion was even more amazing on the big screen (and if costume designer Ruth E. Carter isn\u2019t nominated for ALL the awards, I\u2019m boycotting award shows forever). And the storyline (again, the screenplay and director Ryan Coogler better be up for ALL the awards) is so timely and relevant that I actually felt empathy for the \u201cvillain\u201d Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan).\n\n\n\nAnd though the movie is called Black Panther, it is the black women of Wakanda\u2014from the fiercest warriors of the Dora Milaje to Shuri (Letitia Wright), the brilliant scientist who develops Wakanda\u2019s tech (and delivers the funniest lines in the movie), and the calm, regal beauty of Queen Mother Ramonda (Angela Bassett)\u2014who give the movie its heart. I wish my 12-year-old self could have seen such badass black women so prominently featured in a big-budget action movie. And I know that 12-year-old black girls who see the movie today will feel inspired and empowered by these black women, and encouraged to pursue their dreams, no matter what.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLook for me in the line as I hit the theater a few more times to bask in the glorious world of Wakanda.\n\n\n\nGIF\n\nAngela Helm, Contributing Editor\n\nI was hopeful but a little bit afraid of the hype surrounding Black Panther (see Empire three years ago). I shouldn\u2019t have been. It was every single thing. Big-budget action. Drama. Comic relief. And an all-encompassing, well-lit blackness that flew off the screen and overwhelmed my senses.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere will be much said about Killmonger, a complicated character who had one of the most powerful lines of the film (I gasped when he said it, and then threw a hand in the air), but what I loved most about him was that although he graduated from the Naval Academy at 19 and went to MIT, he was still so Oakland with his gold teeth and unrepentant brilliance.\n\n\n\nThe white gaze was nonexistent. This was for us, by us and quite possibly a game changer for cinema. I cannot wait for my unborn grandchildren to see it. Wakanda forever.\n\nCorey Townsend, Weekend Social Editor\n\nOne word: FASHION! The looks that were served in Black Panther sent me into a state of euphoria. The bold patterns served as a reminder that color was indeed invented for those with melanin.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe movie also served as a reminder that the world would be lost without black women!\n\nTerrell Jermaine Starr, Senior Reporter\n\nAs soon as I stepped out of the movie theater, I was no longer in Wakanda. And that made me sad. I was forced to share an UberPool with two colonizers. I wanted to yell \u201cColonizers!\u201d and ask them for their tourist visas, but I could not. We weren\u2019t in Wakanda. Nor am I Shuri. I am joking, but I\u2019m really not.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor more than two hours, I was surrounded by blackness, consumed with a power of self and possibility I\u2019d never experienced during a film. For two hours, whiteness was not centered. I was. It was challenging to wrestle with that reality and the possibilities of such a world because I was born into a reality where whiteness is the default. My struggles, my successes, my dreams are all predicated on fending off and negotiating with whiteness. In Wakanda, whiteness negotiates with me and has few options but to comply.\n\nThat is a wonderful feeling. I have never watched a Marvel film\u2014nor am I a comics fan\u2014but that has changed. Black Panther left me with a buoyancy about what our current world strives to make impossible: a world centered in blackness, our existence. There are no bells and whistles to Wakanda. It just was. For two hours, so was I. I just was.\n\nNow I am in America, where just being is a struggle. I long for Wakanda.\n\nDanielle Young, Producer\n\nThis is my second time seeing Black Panther, and it won\u2019t be my last. My emotions are not done with this movie. It not only lives up to the epic hype but also pens the only love letter to Diasporic blackness that you\u2019ll ever need. When I got a chance to watch the movie the first time, I wrote a spoiler-free review that allowed me to dig into the black pride this movie undeniably gifts you. Watching T\u2019Challa\u2019s (Chadwick Boseman) baby sister, Shuri, bounce around her lab, brilliantly leading Wakanda\u2019s tech, made me feel like a little girl watching her new role model. Representation matters, and there\u2019s nothing quite like showing little black girls and boys that tech is a possibility for them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are just so many good parts, pieces, moments, visuals, everything, but Killmonger is another standout. Obviously, Michael B. Jordan is ribbed for our pleasure, but his portrayal of a villain is delicious. His character is so well-rounded, so wounded and almost right in his attempt to dethrone King T\u2019Challa. And having his character represent black America in the sense of longing to reach home, the Motherland, was so uncomfortably beautiful. The only thing I have left to say about Black Panther is thank you for ...\u201dcolonizer.\u201d\n\nP.J. Rickards, Video Producer\n\nI\u2019ve been taking my 12-year-old son to see superhero movies for years now. It\u2019s definitely his thing: the opening, big action scenes, the one-liners, the larger-than-life graphics and the excitement after. It hit me while watching Black Panther: We\u2019re going to share that with a movie about a black superhero, strong black characters in a remarkable, all-black world. I already felt that way after seeing the trailer, but it was a whole other thing when I got to finally experience the full movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll I could think about was how he would react at certain parts and the discussions it could open up. And to see it with black people proud and dressed up. It reminded me a bit of the level of pride when Malcolm X came out and everyone was wearing X hats and dashikis. You could tell it was made with love by people of color for our people. It also made me hopeful that this will continue to be a regular occurrence, and even though it\u2019s a big deal for the grown-ups, the impact on young people growing up might be greater than we think.\n\nJason Johnson, Politics Editor\n\nI still don\u2019t know what the heck I saw, and I\u2019ve seen the movie three times. All I know is that I was fighting back thug tears every time Killmonger spoke, and this might\u2019ve been the first time in my life that I sat in a mostly black theater and people only made noise at the appropriate times. The other thing I know is this: it\u2019s Valentine\u2019s week and Black History Month, so if you bought us Black Panther tickets this weekend, we go together \u2026.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAshley Velez, Digital Video Producer\n\nBlack Panther made me feel so many things. I\u2019ve shouted \u201cWakanda forever!\u201d too many times to count since last night. Not only was Black Panther visually stunning\u2014from the cinematography to the lighting and costume design\u2014but the writing was also incredibly executed and engaging. It created space for film watchers to have meaningful dialogue surrounding things like generational trauma, conflicting methods of liberation, and identity throughout the Diaspora. Nothing about how these themes was presented felt forced, which is where modern films and television tend to drop the ball.\n\nI really appreciated the fact that Black Panther didn\u2019t feel like it solely revolved around T\u2019Challa\u2019s mental and physical conflicts. The bulk of the characters were elevated in sincere ways. Because of this, I was able to connect with multiple characters throughout the film. I still can\u2019t decide if I want to be Okoye (Danai Gurira), Nakia (Lupita Nyong\u2019o) or Shuri! That alone speaks to the significance of how black women were portrayed throughout the film.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOh yeah, listen to the soundtrack again after watching the movie! I appreciated it so much more!\n\n\n\nA final note: If you\u2019re a colonizer, I feel bad for you, son.\n\nPsych. No, I don\u2019t.\n\nAnne Branigin, News Fellow\n\nBefore the film, I kept thinking about how Black Panther came out almost a year after Get Out. Wakanda is in some ways the antithesis of \u201cthe sunken place.\u201d Where the latter expressed a loss of control\u2014being at the mercy of \u201cbenevolent\u201d whiteness\u2014Wakanda represents liberation and self-determination in a powerful way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy mother\u2019s country has been colonized twice: first by the Spanish, then by the U.S. Although one of our national heroes killed one of the world\u2019s greatest colonizers, Ferdinand Magellan, the enduring evidence of their actions is in our names, food, features, vocabulary. I love how Black Panther imagines a land written off as a Third World country as being, instead, a superpower\u2014a land free from colonization and subjugation. I love the questions it asks\u2014about what we could be if we got to keep the most precious parts of ourselves, and about the responsibility associated with that.\n\n", "keywords": ["love", "went", "thing", "live", "film", "opening", "women", "world", "night", "movie", "panther", "black", "wakanda", "watching", "forever"], "polarity": 0.11046091495310241, "subjectivity": 0.48518148518148513},

But with the buzz for Black Panther and seeing just how much a black character resonated with an audience, the door has been thrust wide open for more black characters who look, talk and act like us to be featured in this medium.\n\n\u201cRepresentation matters. The lack of representation also matters,\u201d comic book writer Bryan Edward Hill explains to The Root. \u201cStories ultimately tie back to mythology, and it\u2019s the way we rationalize good and evil. When you\u2019re not represented in stories, especially when you\u2019re not a protagonist or a hero, and you\u2019re confronted with that over and over again, subconsciously you start to question your own agency in the world.\u201d\n\nThe significance of black children and adults seeing themselves in comic books has long been undervalued by publishers. But with a diverse crop of black heroes (and anti-heroes) cropping up and finding success, films like Black Panther will hopefully become the norm and no longer outliers that we have to celebrate because we\u2019re unsure we\u2019ll ever see something like them again.\n\nHill\u2019s ongoing DC Comics series, Michael Cray, is one that will draw its fair share of attention because of the comic\u2019s unique narrative and the fact that it is written by a black man with a black title character and a black artist providing the visual element.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichael Cray is a fascinating story in which the title character is an assassin who exists in an alternate version of the DC universe and is tasked with hunting down evil versions of DC heroes, which include Arrow, the Flash and Aquaman.\n\n\u201cThe initial concept was pretty broad,\u201d Hill says of the spinoff to DC\u2019s The Wildstorm, by Warren Ellis. \u201c[Ellis] wanted me to tell a story of this guy who is in between masters and found a new organization that wanted him to take out evil versions of DC heroes. I was interested in the idea of not being able to trust your own consciousness and Cray\u2019s background as a guy who has received dogma his entire life. There\u2019s a story of a guy growing in power while simultaneously being a weapon for other people, and how those things come into conflict [is] really interesting.\u201d\n\nHill drew upon his own personal experiences as well as conversations with family and friends who had a military background to mold the personality of Cray.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI try to find real-world experience that I can insert into the work,\u201d he says. \u201cI was able to reach out to some people and get some stories about what it was like to hunt human beings for a living. From that research, I was able to paint a portrait that felt authentic to me. Then I layered it with my own life experience.\u201d\n\nAs for Hill\u2019s journey to this point, it\u2019s certainly been one that is unique in its own right.\n\nWith his father\u2019s untimely death due to cancer when he was 8, Hill desperately needed something to have faith in. After entering a comic book store and coming across a Batman comic that seemed to mirror his emotional weight of losing a parent, the St. Louis native found something to believe in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBruce Wayne was going through everything I was going through, but he was able to take that pain and turn it into something,\u201d Hill recalls. \u201cAs a kid, you are looking for your pathways and trying to figure out what is possible and what is impossible. For me, Batman became an instructive mythology on how to deal with grief, anger and all of those emotions.\u201d\n\nWith St. Louis admittedly not being a fertile ground for breeding African-American writers, Hill grew up enjoying comics but never really considered a career writing comics until later in life.\n\n\u201cI wanted to go into law enforcement,\u201d Hill reveals. \u201cI thought I was going to be an FBI agent, but my mother said, \u2018Nope, you can\u2019t have a gun so pick something else.\u2019 If I couldn\u2019t be an FBI agent, I wanted to tell stories. That led me to writing, and comics were always the most exciting stories you can read. I couldn\u2019t get that experience from any other forum.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter graduating from New York University film school, Hill worked as a freelance journalist before landing his first comic-writing job with Top Cow Productions in 2010. Since then, he\u2019s worked on a number of comics, including Witchblade, Postal and 7 Days From Hell.\n\nHe recognized early on that he was a black writer in a predominantly white space and needed to find a way to balance servicing the needs of readers with introducing characters of color.\n\n\u201cWhen I started writing, I knew that if you were to platform and agenda the task of writing characters of color and center them in fiction, you would have a very difficult path to be a professional,\u201d he says. \u201cEarly on, I would always balance things. There were less opportunities for writers of color and characters of color to be in these stories. This evolution that we\u2019ve had is a great thing. We\u2019re no longer telling a new generation what they can\u2019t do; they are growing up with a more wide-open field of participation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeing at the helm of Michael Cray has been yet another balancing act for the 40-year-old. With a history of black characters being trapped in their own blackness, Hill sought to ensure that Cray was a black man with black experiences, but one who was not defined solely by those encounters.\n\n\u201cI know that as a black man, I don\u2019t wake up every day thinking about being black and filter every experience I have through a prism of race,\u201d Hill says. \u201cBut there tends to be a trend when you have characters of color that is the only thing they think about the entire time, and every conversation is governed by it.

The psychology behind that alone is worth dissecting, and Hill manages to do that while making sure the reader is never misled into thinking that Michael Cray is anything but a black man.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe have more dimensions than [just being black],\u201d Hill says while looking toward the future in a post-Black Panther world. \u201cThat is the next evolution of characters of color.

I still don\u2019t think I\u2019ve fully processed or fully understand what impact this movie is going to have on people\u2019s lives. So I\u2019m excited.\u201d \u2014Douriean\n\nJewelry designer and metalsmith Douriean Fletcher\u2014who designs and retails simply as Douriean\u2014is having the kind of breakthrough moment most artists can\u2019t even begin to dream of. Handpicked by friend and legendary costume designer Ruth E. Carter to join the costume team of Black Panther (the two previously worked together on 2016\u2019s Roots), Douriean\u2019s handcrafted jewelry and metalwork adorn the citizens and royalty of Wakanda\u2014perhaps most dazzlingly as the armor and neckpieces of the incredible warrior women of the Dora Milaje.\n\nWatching her own work in action was a thrilling experience, as Douriean told The Glow Up:\n\n\n\nSeeing the movie, it was an absolute joy to see this glistening armor just pop off the screen. ... These Dora characters are the first defense of Wakanda; they\u2019re the ones that defend the honor and the safety of the country. So I think I didn\u2019t really fully process what that meant\u2014that I was creating those pieces\u2014until I saw the movie the other day. The actual craftsmanship of those pieces was a very interesting yet challenging experience ... these pieces have a meaning. They have a specific meaning of who these women are, and what they do for their country. They\u2019re there to be resilient and strong, and to protect Wakanda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m inspired and intrigued by how we choose to represent ourselves as resilient and beautiful and functional, regardless of what we\u2019ve experienced in life.\u201d\n\nDouriean\u2019s handmade, often hand-hammered aesthetic was a perfect match for this newest cinematic corner of the Marvel Universe, which introduces us to the technologically advanced, culturally rich fictional African nation of Wakanda. Douriean, who considers her work not only Afrofuturistic but \u201cAncient Futuristic\u201d or \u201cPrimal Chic,\u201d welcomed the challenge to translate her artistic aesthetic to the big screen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDouriean explained:\n\nI feel like I have a lot of responsibility, first off, to communicate a certain message through my work. I feel like it\u2019s a lot of responsibility, but I think it\u2019s a great position to be in. ... But I think as far as the Marvel Universe, it\u2019s a perfect match because I was able to bring something different to this culture of Wakanda, this fictional country that they had yet to really tap into.\n\nCostume designer Carter agreed, telling The Glow Up that she\u2019d specifically chosen Douriean because she felt strongly that the metal pieces used in Black Panther had to have a \u201chand-tooled African, hand-hammered\u201d aesthetic. That, coupled with director Ryan Coogler\u2019s desire for even the armor to look like beautiful African jewelry, made Douriean the ideal choice. The jewelry designer confessed to us that initially, she held back in deference to the Marvel aesthetic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c[Ruth E. Carter] said, \u2018This isn\u2019t Douriean enough. You have to put more of yourself in it.\u2019 That was exciting. Like, oh, wait, you\u2019re giving me some space to do my thing,\u201d Douriean said.\n\nA Pasadena, Calif., native, Douriean has been creating jewelry since 2010. She is mostly self-taught, save for a three-month metalsmithing class in New Orleans. Having traveled throughout Tanzania and South Africa and now based in Los Angeles, she makes work that \u201cexplores cultural identity, femininity, spirituality and divine power.\u201d When asked where she gleans her inspiration, she told The Glow Up:\n\n\n\nSometimes it\u2019s my story; if I experience something that\u2019s quite challenging, I\u2019ll take inspiration from that\u2014and, sometimes, motivation from those experiences\u2014and put that into a piece. Sometimes I literally just have dreams, and I wake up in the middle of night and sketch them out. And sometimes other people\u2019s stories, or just their essence ... women, we\u2019re very multifaceted creatures. So I\u2019m inspired and intrigued by how we choose to represent ourselves as resilient and beautiful and functional, regardless of what we\u2019ve experienced in life. ... The physique of a woman is very beautiful, and I want\u2014whenever I create something\u2014to be able to adorn someone to where they feel regal and beautiful and powerful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a female metalsmith, Douriean admitted that her eight-year journey has been a challenge, as there aren\u2019t many women in the field, let alone black women. But she credits the obstacles with her growth as an artist and innovator:\n\n\n\nI feel like I\u2019ve been underestimated at times; people are just surprised that I can create what I do, or doubt that I can create what I make. And because it\u2019s so different from what people think when they think of jewelry-making, it\u2019s been a challenge to find my niche and my clientele. Like this whole entire process, like this is the first time\u2014these past two years\u2014where I feel like I\u2019ve finally found my tribe and my clientele of people who can understand and accept my work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith that growth and increasing exposure have come major shifts for Douriean, especially as the officially licensed jewelry designer for both Black Panther and the upcoming Avengers film, which promises to be an even larger production. While creating for mass market raises her exposure and reach, it definitely presented challenges to her typically one-of-a-kind approach to design. According to Douriean:\n\nAs an artist, I like to create one-offs\u2014I like to create one thing, it has a story to it, it means something and it\u2019s for one particular person. To be able to have to expand that, and create a narrative for a group of people, it\u2019s a different way of approaching my work. So, for instance, the Black Panther line ... I created that, number one, for the comic book fan; the young men and women or the young boys and girls who grew up on the comics, who are super excited, who have been waiting for this moment for years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor those of us coveting a piece of Black Panther to take home, the sterling silver Black Panther collection is currently available on Douriean\u2019s website. A collection inspired by Panther villain Killmonger is next, and lastly, a collection inspired by the Dora Milaje, which Douriean will handcraft herself.\n\nThe Glow Up caught a preview of both Lupita Nyong\u2019o and the designer herself at the Marvel Studios Black Panther Welcome to Wakanda New York Fashion Week presentation on Monday. Frankly, we can\u2019t wait to see if 24-karat-gold neck rings and epaulets are in our futures. The designer was coy:\n\n\u201cI wanted the Dora pieces to be very special, so I\u2019m handcrafting all of those. So it\u2019s coming. It\u2019s coming,\u201d she told us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut right now, Douriean is just savoring the moment and trying to process how it feels to become part of cinematic history:", "keywords": ["create", "designer", "feel", "jeweler", "women", "jewelry", "think", "douriean", "work", "panther", "black", "adorned", "metal", "heavy", "armored"], "polarity": 0.2566777954749653, "subjectivity": 0.5426845952789348},

It has nothing to do with my dislike for you or your people. In fact, some of my best friends are white. Well ... one of my best friends is white. OK, I\u2019ll be honest, all of my best friends are black, but one of them is kinda light-skinned, and when I was in the 11th grade, I went to a New Edition concert with three Caucasian classmates, so that should count for something.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut my hesitancy in penning this correspondence is based on another fact: I didn\u2019t believe you were real. I didn\u2019t discount your existence the way I don\u2019t believe in unicorns, good cops or Rihanna. (Yeah, I said it. I believe Rih Rih is a highly advanced, computer-generated image based on our collective fantasies. You might think it\u2019s crazy, but I stand by my research.)\n\nWhen people told me that there were actual individuals upset about the upcoming Marvel movie Black Panther, I thought they were exaggerating or overestimating the number. I suspect there are always a few fringe kooks who share an idiotic ideology.\n\nKyrie Irving and B.o.B think the Earth is flat. Some people believe that Donald Trump is both stable and a genius. And once, on the dance floor of a crowded nightclub, a woman told me I was handsome and cute. (At least that\u2019s what I think she said, although she may have said, \u201cYou\u2019re standing on my foot.\u201d It was pretty crowded and I\u2019d consumed a few beverages. But for the sake of this argument, let\u2019s just say it was the cute thing.) My point here is, sometimes people have wildly diverging opinions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust as I was ready to dismiss the notion that there might be more than a handful of people who disliked the notion of a Black Panther movie before they even saw it, someone sent me a transcript of Rush Limbaugh ranting about liberals embracing Black Panther.\n\nI honestly get why Limbaugh was upset. If I were a half-deaf, impotent walrus who had to sit in front of a microphone yelling to white senior citizens who still listen to AM radio while popping Oxycontin like Tic Tacs during commercial breaks, I\u2019d probably be a little jealous of T\u2019Challa, too. Plus, Limbaugh is racist, and the film does have the words \u201cBlack\u201d and \u201cPanther\u201d in it, so .... there\u2019s that.\n\nBut people kept sending me things. There was a story calling Black Panther \u201cobviously racist,\u201d a Breitbart article that called the comic book \u201cBlack Lives Matter-themed,\u201d and that piece where Ben Shapiro crumpled into a rice-paper-thin ball of fuckboy fragility in a nonsensical monologue about how this is the fault of black people, leftists and, of course, Barack Obama.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, that\u2019s only three racists people.\n\nAnd then, like a fool, I ventured into the land of white nonsense where coffee machines and Bluetooth speakers somehow have all colluded to form a plot to eradicate the great arrhythmic race: Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s Twitter,\u201d I reasoned. White people on Twitter are like the Incredible Hulk when he\u2019s off his meds: They\u2019ll get mad at anything. Then I happened upon this well-reasoned discourse between writer Zack Linly and a random Facebooker:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can understand why some white people are upset. After all, I distinctly recall how upset black people were about Harry Potter, The Lord of the Rings, When Harry Met Sally, Twilight, Terminator and The Passion of the Christ (yes, they literally made a movie about Jesus with no black people!).\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be fair, the above-mentioned movies were not comic book movies. Making a film about a superhero from an all-black place is an egregious offense. Especially since Marvel put so much detail into making sure its other superhero movies had diverse casts.\n\nI recall how the white outrage forced Hollywood into casting a South American actress to play Wonder Woman, since she was from a fictional race of Amazonian warriors. (I didn\u2019t Google it, but I\u2019m pretty sure Gal Gadot is from Brazil or somewhere. If she were Israeli or something, it would mean white people didn\u2019t care about the ethnicity of comic book characters until a black one came around and triggered their racist ... you know what? I\u2019m not even going there. She\u2019s gotta be from South America, or wypipo would look very stupid right now.) We really thank you for making sure they include black actors every time they flash back to Superman\u2019s home planet of Krypton.\n\nPlus, I\u2019m probably making up the white outcry when someone floated the idea that Donald Glover might be the next Superman, or Idris Elba could play James Bond. I probably imagined that wypipo were upset about John Boyega playing a Stormtrooper, just like I dreamed about Rihanna or that woman who thought I was handsome. (I\u2019m pretty sure she said \u201chandsome and cute,\u201d not \u201cstanding on my foot.\u201d I mean ... I was actually standing on her foot, but that\u2019s neither here nor there.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause white people have repeatedly stood up for inclusion and diversity in casting, we would like to admit that this is our fault. Forgive us for being excited that there is finally a movie that caters to our sensibilities without kowtowing to the notion of a white savior.\n\nI tell you what we\u2019ll do. To make this up to you, we promise that we will remain marginalized, mostly ancillary characters in most of the Hollywood blockbusters for the rest of the year. We also swear that we will allow you to win and be nominated for the bulk of Oscars, Golden Globes, Emmys, Tony Awards, Peabody Awards, Billboard Awards, MTV Awards, America\u2019s Got Talent, spelling bees, luge races, school shootings, mass murders, police-shooting trials, Senate races and rose ceremonies on The Bachelor.\n\nI don\u2019t want there to be any hard feelings. I know that white people have so little to celebrate in America that seeing black people smile, if only for one second, could just be the thing that breaks your brittle little racist hearts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSincerely,\n\nYour handsome and cute black friend", "keywords": ["open", "making", "im", "handsome", "upset", "white", "sure", "movie", "panther", "black", "racist", "letter"], "polarity": 0.12658975328878244, "subjectivity": 0.4967231258493393},

However, the past few years have finally seen some cracks in the proverbial glass ceiling as black culture has permeated into the mainstream of the comic book universe. From Marvel\u2019s reimagining of classic rap album covers as comic book covers to the success of Black Lightning, Luke Cage and what is expected to be a massive bow at the box office for Black Panther, minorities in comic books are no longer a rarity in 2018.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s astounding to consider that it took this long for comic book publishers to recognize the appeal of black characters who are more than just sidekicks and henchmen. But with the buzz for Black Panther and seeing just how much a black character resonated with an audience, the door has been thrust wide open for more black characters who look, talk and act like us to be featured in this medium.\n\n\u201cRepresentation matters. The lack of representation also matters,\u201d comic book writer Bryan Edward Hill explains to The Root. \u201cStories ultimately tie back to mythology, and it\u2019s the way we rationalize good and evil. When you\u2019re not represented in stories, especially when you\u2019re not a protagonist or a hero, and you\u2019re confronted with that over and over again, subconsciously you start to question your own agency in the world.\u201d\n\nThe significance of black children and adults seeing themselves in comic books has long been undervalued by publishers. But with a diverse crop of black heroes (and anti-heroes) cropping up and finding success, films like Black Panther will hopefully become the norm and no longer outliers that we have to celebrate because we\u2019re unsure we\u2019ll ever see something like them again.\n\nHill\u2019s ongoing DC Comics series, Michael Cray, is one that will draw its fair share of attention because of the comic\u2019s unique narrative and the fact that it is written by a black man with a black title character and a black artist providing the visual element.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichael Cray is a fascinating story in which the title character is an assassin who exists in an alternate version of the DC universe and is tasked with hunting down evil versions of DC heroes, which include Arrow, the Flash and Aquaman.\n\n\u201cThe initial concept was pretty broad,\u201d Hill says of the spinoff to DC\u2019s The Wildstorm, by Warren Ellis. \u201c[Ellis] wanted me to tell a story of this guy who is in between masters and found a new organization that wanted him to take out evil versions of DC heroes. I was interested in the idea of not being able to trust your own consciousness and Cray\u2019s background as a guy who has received dogma his entire life. There\u2019s a story of a guy growing in power while simultaneously being a weapon for other people, and how those things come into conflict [is] really interesting.\u201d\n\nHill drew upon his own personal experiences as well as conversations with family and friends who had a military background to mold the personality of Cray.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI try to find real-world experience that I can insert into the work,\u201d he says. \u201cI was able to reach out to some people and get some stories about what it was like to hunt human beings for a living. From that research, I was able to paint a portrait that felt authentic to me. Then I layered it with my own life experience.\u201d\n\nAs for Hill\u2019s journey to this point, it\u2019s certainly been one that is unique in its own right.\n\nWith his father\u2019s untimely death due to cancer when he was 8, Hill desperately needed something to have faith in. After entering a comic book store and coming across a Batman comic that seemed to mirror his emotional weight of losing a parent, the St. Louis native found something to believe in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBruce Wayne was going through everything I was going through, but he was able to take that pain and turn it into something,\u201d Hill recalls. \u201cAs a kid, you are looking for your pathways and trying to figure out what is possible and what is impossible. For me, Batman became an instructive mythology on how to deal with grief, anger and all of those emotions.\u201d\n\nWith St. Louis admittedly not being a fertile ground for breeding African-American writers, Hill grew up enjoying comics but never really considered a career writing comics until later in life.\n\n\u201cI wanted to go into law enforcement,\u201d Hill reveals. \u201cI thought I was going to be an FBI agent, but my mother said, \u2018Nope, you can\u2019t have a gun so pick something else.\u2019 If I couldn\u2019t be an FBI agent, I wanted to tell stories. That led me to writing, and comics were always the most exciting stories you can read. I couldn\u2019t get that experience from any other forum.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter graduating from New York University film school, Hill worked as a freelance journalist before landing his first comic-writing job with Top Cow Productions in 2010. Since then, he\u2019s worked on a number of comics, including Witchblade, Postal and 7 Days From Hell.\n\nHe recognized early on that he was a black writer in a predominantly white space and needed to find a way to balance servicing the needs of readers with introducing characters of color.\n\n\u201cWhen I started writing, I knew that if you were to platform and agenda the task of writing characters of color and center them in fiction, you would have a very difficult path to be a professional,\u201d he says. \u201cEarly on, I would always balance things. There were less opportunities for writers of color and characters of color to be in these stories. This evolution that we\u2019ve had is a great thing. We\u2019re no longer telling a new generation what they can\u2019t do; they are growing up with a more wide-open field of participation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeing at the helm of Michael Cray has been yet another balancing act for the 40-year-old. With a history of black characters being trapped in their own blackness, Hill sought to ensure that Cray was a black man with black experiences, but one who was not defined solely by those encounters.\n\n\u201cI know that as a black man, I don\u2019t wake up every day thinking about being black and filter every experience I have through a prism of race,\u201d Hill says. \u201cBut there tends to be a trend when you have characters of color that is the only thing they think about the entire time, and every conversation is governed by it. It\u2019s just not realistic. A lot of it is well-intentioned and broadens the conversation, but a lot of it left me cold because it doesn\u2019t feel real to me.\u201d\n\nRather than force Michael Cray\u2019s blackness into every conversation he has in the comic, Hill made it a point that while his character is black, it isn\u2019t all that the story is about. After all, Michael Cray is about a man who is hunting down a twisted version of the Flash. The psychology behind that alone is worth dissecting, and Hill manages to do that while making sure the reader is never misled into thinking that Michael Cray is anything but a black man.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe have more dimensions than [just being black],\u201d Hill says while looking toward the future in a post-Black Panther world. \u201cThat is the next evolution of characters of color. Allowing them to escape the gravitational pull of the story being about their race. We have other stories to tell. Being black is an element of the story, but we don\u2019t want to make his story only about that.\u201d", "keywords": ["hill", "representation", "flash", "black", "michael", "comic", "characters", "writing", "edward", "comics", "color", "book", "writer", "kill", "explains", "cray", "matter"], "polarity": 0.05555084426353084, "subjectivity": 0.5093901434386509},

Carter\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 reads like a list of iconic favorites from contemporary black cinema. In the 30 years since her first film, Spike Lee\u2019s 1988 hit, School Daze, the Oscar- and Emmy-nominated costume designer has amassed more than 60 film and television credits, including I\u2019m Gonna Git You Sucka (1988); Do the Right Thing (1989); Mo\u2019 Better Blues (1990); House Party 2 (1991); Jungle Fever (1991); The Five Heartbeats (1991); Malcolm X (1992); What\u2019s Love Got to Do With It (1993); Crooklyn (1994); Clockers (1995); B*A*P*S (1997); Rosewood (1997); Amistad (1997); Love & Basketball (2000); Shaft (2000); Bamboozled (2000); Black Dynamite (2009); Sparkle (2012); The Butler (2013); Selma (2014) and Marshall (2017), not to mention Being Mary Jane and the recent reboot of Roots (2016).\n\nNow Carter is stunning us once again with her work in the most anticipated film of the year, Black Panther, her 40th film and first superhero narrative (unless you count Malcolm X). The Glow Up was blessed with the opportunity to speak with her during the flurry of publicity for this groundbreaking film while she took a rare timeout in Cape Town, South Africa. It proved a fitting setting to discuss how she helped create the fictional African country of Wakanda, and how it feels to quietly be one of the architects of black cultural collective consciousness. Ever humble, the now legendary designer told us:\n\nI always felt a responsibility to be authentic and real with depicting the culture. ... You look at enough research, you know the people. They\u2019re your relatives, they\u2019re your family. And so, collectively, when [I] look at my work, I just feel proud that I had some consistency with my approach to all of them. There was never one that I felt wasn\u2019t important for us to learn from. I was challenged each time to really get it right. ... That\u2019s kind of been my journey. And so when I look back at everything, I feel a sense of accomplishment and pride that Black Panther has kind of brought me full circle. I feel like I traveled from slavery with Roots and Amistad. And I went through the Depression with Rosewood in the \u201920s. I did Selma in the \u201950s. With Malcolm X, it was the \u201920s all the way through the \u201960s, and then I got a little \u201970s here and there with some funny ones like Black Dynamite. And then Black Panther came along, and now I\u2019m circling right back to Africa. So I actually feel like I closed the circle a little bit ... and I think they all helped to connect African history and African-American history. I\u2019m hoping for that.\n\nCarter, who has made history of her own as the first African American to be nominated for an Academy Award in costume design\u2014first for Malcolm X and again for Amistad\u2014ventured into new territory for her first Marvel film. In a stroke of luck, she learned she\u2019d gotten the job while working on Marshall, the Thurgood Marshall biopic starring future T\u2019Challa, Chadwick Boseman, directed by Black Panther comic writer Reginald Hudlin.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m like, you know how lucky is this? I get to study [Chadwick\u2019s] body; I get to ask Reggie questions about the Black Panther concept,\u201d Carter said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut even that recon couldn\u2019t fully prepare Carter for the Marvel experience, working with a team of five illustrators and a huge crew to bring the citizens of Wakanda to life. It was also the first time she had to design with movie merchandise in mind\u2014including action figures\u2014which meant that unlike Carter\u2019s previous work, many of the major costumes, like T\u2019Challa\u2019s iconic suit, were already well-defined. Instead, her role was to bring authenticity to characters that the fans of Black Panther have previously known only as illustrations, as she told The Glow Up: \u201cOnce I got the framework, we did a lot of experimentation. ... It\u2019s kind of like they gave me a coloring book and a big box of crayons.\u201d\n\nThat experimentation involved extensive research by Carter\u2019s team of four, exploring the ancient peoples of Africa\u2014including the Zulu, Maasai, Himba, Xhosa and the Turkana, which inspired the beautiful beading and neckpieces of the Dora Milaje. (Notably, Carter tries to steer clear of the word \u201ctribe\u201d because of its colonialist overtones, preferring to simply call each group of people by its name.)\n\nIn doing so, her team divided Wakanda into districts, according to a \u201cbible\u201d of sorts composed by director Ryan Coogler and production designer Hannah Beachler, that outlined both the story and layout of the fictional country. Said Carter:\n\nIt was an incredible piece of work; it was an incredible notebook that really forged us all so far ahead, because we were all working from the same nucleus ... there\u2019s different [communities] of Wakanda, and that bible that they did really outlined what parts of Wakanda were what. [For example] if you take any city, like New York, and you divide it by, you know, midtown, Brooklyn, the Village, NYU area, uptown, Columbia, Harlem, you kind of have a good sense of how Wakanda is broken up, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to Carter\u2019s core team, she also employed locals in South Africa and Ghana to search out antiques that would inspire the handmade feel she strongly felt Black Panther\u2019s costumes needed to have. Following Coogler\u2019s request that even the armor of the Dora Milaje feel like jewelry, Carter also brought on board friend and jeweler Douriean, who specializes in Afrofuturistic, hand-tooled, hand-hammered pieces, many of which have been worn by cast members during the film\u2019s premieres and press. Douriean is also the creator of Black Panther\u2019s officially licensed line of jewelry.\n\nAnd while Carter doesn\u2019t describe the experience as a seamless one, she credits Marvel for helping her realize the vision; even when some of the challenges of bringing Wakanda to life proved daunting:\n\nI had the greatest support from Marvel. The head executives, they never wavered. I never, ever felt\u2014and you know, every costume designer has at some point on a show felt like, \u201cThey\u2019re going to fire me, I know it. I\u2019m going to be fired tonight.\u201d We all go through that. And even though I may have had those thoughts, they were few and far between because I felt like I was supported 100 percent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney 1 / 15\n\nCarter is no stranger to making even the improbable possible; in her days as a student at Hampton University, she created a costume-design curriculum for herself after finding that there was nothing available to foster her budding talent. After graduation and a few opera-company internships, her HBCU experience and ingenuity came in handy when a chance meeting with director Spike Lee led to her first film, the now classic School Daze. It was the first of 14 films they\u2019d make together.\n\nBut even if she\u2019d do it all again, would she advise others to follow in her footsteps? She told The Glow Up: \u201cWell, don\u2019t do what I did, because I don\u2019t think it works today. I think that there\u2019s more avenues than I had. So I hope that my career has made some of those avenues available for other people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI always felt a responsibility to be authentic and real with depicting the culture. They\u2019re your relatives, they\u2019re your family. There was never one that I felt wasn\u2019t important for us to learn from.\n\nIf nominated for next year\u2019s Academy Award, Carter could become both the first woman ever to win for a superhero film and the first black woman to win for best costume design. But when asked if she has any reservations or resentments about primarily being hired to costume black films\u2014which make up most, but far from all, of her work\u2014she had this to say:", "keywords": ["cultural", "wannabes", "feel", "film", "marveldisney", "carter", "consciousness", "know", "theyre", "ruth", "costumes", "black", "wakanda", "panther", "felt"], "polarity": 0.2138487889520948, "subjectivity": 0.47147418697005467},

A young black woman narrating. References to Fannie Lou Hamer and Harriet Tubman. Mentions of SZA and Solange. Testosterone might power Black Lightning, the superhero, but a healthy dose of estrogen helps drive Black Lightning, the series.\n\nIn the series, based on the DC Comic launched in 1977, actor Cress Williams (who\u2019s been paying dues as far back as Scooter on Living Single and Lavon Hayes on Hart of Dixie) plays Jefferson Pierce, a hometown Olympic-gold-medal hero-turned-do-gooder principal at Garfield High and community leader, forced to secretly crusade as Black Lightning. Forced because the father of two daughters\u2014high schooler Jennifer (China Anne McClain) and medical student Anissa (Nafessa Williams)\u2014still pines for their mother, Lynn (Christine Adams, Agent Weaver from Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.).\n\nUnable to handle the painful physical demands and the emotional toll on Jeff (broken bones, bloody wounds), Lynn made it painfully clear that there would be no \u201cwe\u201d with Black Lightning around, eventually divorcing Jeff. And though he suppressed his superhero alter ego, opting to \u201csave more lives as a principal,\u201d she has yet to relent.\n\nHowever, that doesn\u2019t stop Jeff\u2019s eyes from burning with desire for only her (even though there is at least one woman waiting in the wings to happily scoop him up). Because, ultimately, he\u2019s \u201cjust a man who wants his woman back,\u201d he desperately wants to let go of Black Lightning, especially since there is clearly still love on Lynn\u2019s part, too\u2014if only she would allow herself to go there. But despite Jeff\u2019s best intentions, the streets keep calling and derailing their reunion. Since his heart also bleeds for his girls, he will do whatever it takes to keep them safe, even if it means resurrecting Black Lightning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Jeff\u2019s daughters are no damsels in distress. Instead, they are formidable forces in their own right: Jennifer is \u201ca standout scholar-athlete, just like her father,\u201d while Anissa chips in as a health educator. Both are intelligent and strong-willed free thinkers steeped in black history\u2014and \u201cherstory.\u201d While Jennifer is in the throes of teenage rebellion, Anissa goes #BlackLivesMatter hard for social justice. And though their father doesn\u2019t hesitate to protect them, Black Lightning shows that these young women are more than capable of handling themselves. In fact, their strength foreshadows the superhero gifts that surely await them.\n\nStill, some challenges are too big to fight alone. When the rebellious Jennifer entangles herself with local gang the 100, putting both herself and her sister in danger, their father is left with few options to save them. But Black Lightning soon discovers that he can\u2019t just use his gift to save his own and walk away; his entire community is in danger, and just putting in work at Garfield High isn\u2019t going to change that. However, his necessary heroics don\u2019t dim the community\u2019s female voices and concerns.\n\nOne of the more interesting developments in Black Lightning is that the 100\u2019s reign of terror very much includes the sexual violation and exploitation of young black women. Sex trafficking is actually tagged as one of their most egregious crimes here, while most crime stories in urban communities\u2014fictional as well as real-life depictions\u2014overlook the high price that black girls and women pay with their bodies and lives. It\u2019s a grim reality to address in a world that often acts as if black womanhood is expendable and black girlhood is nonexistent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEqually refreshing, black female sexuality isn\u2019t just a straight affair. Through elder daughter Anissa, queer black women are represented and acknowledged. Though this is also true of the comic book series, television is notorious for not following the rules.\n\nBut Anissa\u2019s sexuality is not just significant to the superhero genre; queer black women are typically ignored in all stories, even in LGBTQ-focused ones\u2014and especially in black ones. If they are depicted at all, as in the recent She\u2019s Gotta Have It, it\u2019s more fetishistic than real. Even as black gay men become more regular fixtures in television, demanding at least obligatory representation in contemporary black stories like Insecure, black gay women remain invisible\u2014or seemingly unicorns, like in Survivor\u2019s Remorse. So Black Lightning\u2019s inclusion is a key departure.\n\nBlack Lightning seizes every opportunity to show that black women are very much an organic part of the black community, far beyond the classroom and the church. From the TV news anchor to the cop at the police station to the senator speaking at the school fundraiser, black women are well-represented here. And they aren\u2019t cookie-cutter in appearance, either\u2014not even in hairstyles. Jennifer wears her hair straight and long and Anissa is loose and curly, while their mother, Lynn, is close-cropped. And as a bonus, the women featured are overwhelming chocolate sisters. So clearly the Kerry Washingtons, Issa Raes and Rutina Wesleys are making strong impressions on showrunners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen it comes to how we are represented on the small screen, screenwriter and producer Mara Brock Akil just keeps raising the bar. From Girlfriends to Being Mary Jane\u2014with a little of The Game in between\u2014she has been a key catalyst for projecting images of the contemporary black woman on TV. That she\u2019s been able to accomplish this largely by creating and collaborating with her husband, Salim Akil, is even more impressive. Salim Akil might well be the driving force behind bringing Black Lightning to TV, but the execution clearly demonstrates that he and his wife balance each other out.\n\nEven in the male-dominated superhero genre, the Akils have managed to adapt 1970s idealism to the harsh realities of now, without forcing black women to the background, while staying true to the comics\u2019 black-family spirit. With Black Lightning, they\u2019ve created a TV series for the present that finally includes us all.", "keywords": ["ladies", "woman", "young", "women", "doesnt", "jennifer", "lightning", "superhero", "father", "strike", "tv", "anissa", "black"], "polarity": 0.052559820275647574, "subjectivity": 0.4887036305021914},

If Batman is DC Comics\u2019 king of out-of-nowhere moments of surprise, T\u2019Challa handily takes the crown for Marvel. Here\u2019s a few times he grandly let us know he\u2019s always a few steps ahead of Marvel\u2019s mightiest.\n\n\n\nThe Time He Absolutely Clowned the Fantastic Four\n\nBlack Panther is a man who\u2019s all about plans, and he\u2019s literally been doing it since his first appearance, all the way back in 1966's Fantastic Four #52. T\u2019Challa invites the Fantastic Four to his isolated nation by gifting them a fancy hovercraft, only to use the opportunity to test their skills as a fighting unit. It does... not go well for the FF gang.\n\nDonning his Black Panther garb, T\u2019Challa systematically hunts down each member of the team, strategizing how to best isolate them all and counteract their superpowers. He does it easily, too, and only relents\u2014to bluntly inform them it was merely a test of their skills and little more than an experiment to him\u2014when they get a chance to gang up on him. But it was a hell of an entrance to make, nonetheless.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Time He Exposed His Identity to the World\n\nBy the time the \u201860s were over, T\u2019Challa\u2019s adventures were branching out beyond the borders of Wakanda. He was a card-carrying Avenger and started regularly operating in the US alongside the rest of Earth\u2019s mightiest heroes. But T\u2019Challa also found himself and his fellow Avengers caught up in bubbling racial tension in the country, stoked by hateful debates on a popular talk show... and the fact that there had been sightings of the Black Panther running around committing petty crimes, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt turns out the whole thing was a plan stoked by the Sons of the Serpents to try and kick off a new civil war, with the unmasking of their \u201ccriminal\u201d Black Panther imposter as a black, anti-white activist on national television as a catalyst. T\u2019Challa himself spends most of the story on the run from the allegations against him, and is ultimately captured by the Serpents\u2014but he saves the day in the climax by smashing his way onto TV to unmask the Serpent\u2019s faux-Panther, who it turns out was actually a white guy wearing an elaborate mask. In the process, he reveals his own identity to the watching world, but T\u2019Challa doesn\u2019t care in the slightest.\n\nThe Time He Stopped Iron Man\u2019s Heart\n\nOkay, this doesn\u2019t technically happen to \u201cour\u201d Tony Stark\u2014it happens to a sinister time paradox version of him during the twisty-turny, time travel shenanigans of the \u201cEnemy of the State II\u201d storyline in Christopher Priest and Sal Velluto\u2019s Black Panther back in 2002. But our Tony watches T\u2019Challa go up against the time-twisted version of himself, clad in special armor to counteract Black Panther\u2019s vibranium-enhanced suit, and is absolutely horrified to see what T\u2019Challa is more than willing to do to fight him, if the need ever arises (which, given that superheroes love to fight each other all the time, is a logical potential future).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s not just that T\u2019Challa beats the time paradox Iron Man, though, it\u2019s the way he does it. He overwhelms the functions of Iron Man\u2019s suit, not just disabling it, but literally stopping evil Tony\u2019s heart in the process. That alone scares the bejesus out of regular Tony, but when he confronts T\u2019Challa about it afterward, it\u2019s the fact that Black Panther casually admits he\u2019s fine having a back-up plan like that against one of his closest friends that truly surprises Iron Man.\n\nThe Time He Dumped Storm\n\nNot everyone is a fan of Storm and Black Panther\u2019s marriage, but T\u2019Challa ended it as ruthlessly as he would any fight with a supervillain during the Avengers vs. X-Men event in the bluntest, harshest of ways.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdmittedly at the time, T\u2019Challa was going through a hell of a lot, as Wakanda had been through catastrophic destruction at the hands of a Phoenix Force-infused Namor. But while the disastrous aftermath pained T\u2019Challa, what incensed him even more was that Storm chose to stay with the X-Men instead of coming to Wakanda to offer her godlike powers in assistance. So when she does eventually show up to offer aid, T\u2019Challa bluntly refuses it. And then promptly tells her\u2014surrounded by their fellow heroes\u2014that as Chief of the Panther clan, he had already annulled their marriage, and that she is no longer welcome in Wakanda.\n\nLater on in the series when the Avengers and X-Men start duking out, as the title implies, he rubs salt in the wound by fighting Storm and revealing he\u2019s always known how to disable her weather-controlling powers, then beats her easily in hand-to-hand combat. Ouch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Time He Wiped Out the Wakanda\u2019s Entire Vibranium Supply to Screw Over Doctor Doom\n\nThe 2010 storyline \u201cDoomwar\u201d is a tough one for Black Panther; it\u2019s a moment when he finds himself not just defeated, but overthrown by none other than Doctor Doom himself. Doom doesn\u2019t just covertly take over Wakanda, either, but even offers himself up to the panther god Bast, allowing him access to Wakanda\u2019s vibranium reserves after he humiliatingly steals them from under T\u2019Challa\u2019s nose.\n\nEventually, after infiltrating Latveria in return and almost starting an all-out war, Black Panther eventually confronts Doom in a one-on-one battle. Doom mocks T\u2019Challa for his and Wakanda\u2019s overreliance on vibranium, only for T\u2019Challa to agree... and then send a signal boosted through Doom\u2019s suit that rendered every piece of Wakandan vibranium in the world inert. It robs Doom of his advantage in a moment of total shock, but it also left T\u2019Challa and Wakanda in a suddenly intriguing new state.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Time He Was Daredevil\n\nThe year 2010 was a hectic time for Black Panther. Remember when, err, Daredevil became head of the Hand Ninja Clan and then kinda sorta got possessed by a demon and went evil/mad? \u201cShadowland\u201d was a whole thing that caused not just the street-level heroes of New York to get involved, but a good chunk of Marvel\u2019s mightiest too, including T\u2019Challa. At the end of the storyline Matt Murdock sacrifices himself to defeat the demon within, leaving Hell\u2019s Kitchen without its usual protector for a period.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat is, until T\u2019Challa\u2014who at the time wasn\u2019t Wakanda\u2019s king, having passed on the mantle of Black Panther and of the nation\u2019s rule to his sister, Shuri\u2014 decides to stick around and become Hell\u2019s Kitchen\u2019s premier superhero. It led to the great series Black Panther: The Most Dangerous Man Alive by David Liss and Jefte Palo, but it\u2019s really just the surprise of T\u2019Challa looking around in the wake of \u201cShadowland\u201d and basically going \u201cThis is my turf now\u201d that\u2019s the fun part.\n\nThe Time He Smacked Dr. Doom Around With the Infinity Gauntlet\n\nThe climactic moments of 2015's Secret Wars see the gathered heroes of (what\u2019s left of) the Marvel universe take the fight to \u201cGod Doom,\u201d a wildly powerful Victor Von Doom who forged the Battleworld out of the shattered remnants of the Marvel multiverse in the wake of the universe-mashing \u201cconvergence.\u201d Few people can go up against Doom in such a god-like state... and those few include T\u2019Challa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it\u2019s not just T\u2019Challa as he normally he is. He\u2019s wielding an Infinity Gauntlet from one of the myriad destroyed universes, something that would destroy most people in an instant, or drive them mad. But through sheer force of will, and much to Doom\u2019s surprise, T\u2019Challa doesn\u2019t just have the capacity to use it, but is very happy to use it to beat the hell out of God Doom\u2014at least long enough to distract him from Reed Richard\u2019s plans.\n\nThe Time He Got Into a War of Words With Galactus... and Won\n\nIf you want another series that highlights what a wildly smart (and thoroughly prepared) Black Panther can look like, the recent Ultimates book from Al Ewing and Kenneth Rocafort is a great choice. Because not only do you get to see Black Panther on a cosmic-level superteam, you get to see him do the nearly impossible: Stand toe-to-toe with the devourer of worlds himself and come out on top.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Ultimates\u2019 first mission sees them attempt to solve \u201cthe Galactus problem,\u201d which is to say they want to stop the giant almighty cosmic being who eats planets from continually returning to Earth for a snack. Naturally, the team leaves the bulk of this plan down to T\u2019Challa, so he casually transports himself to Galactus\u2019 realm (an act that, like wielding an Infinity Gauntlet, would drive most people mad) and... just talks to Galactus. Actually, he doesn\u2019t just talk to Galactus, but debates him, running intellectual circles around the world-devourer long enough that the rest of the Ultimates have the time to enact their plan to blast Galactus into the chamber that created him in the first place, turning him into the heroic Life-Bringer instead.

Some of the infamous beads thrown into the crowds reflected the image of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee to protest the removal of his statue from New Orleans\u2019 most prominent traffic circle, which has been a symbolic focal point of parade routes\u2014hence the bead\u2019s name, \u201cForever Lee Circle.\u201d\n\n\n\nThere were also Confederate-flag beads, T-shirts and an old image of the statue clandestinely projected on to City Hall. The Lee monument was removed by Mayor Mitch Landrieu on May 19, 2017, after steady pressure from the #TakeEmDownNOLA movement.\n\n\n\nInitially, the bead controversy mostly played out on local blogs and social media, but concerns over racism at Mardi Gras intensified this week after blackface figurines began popping up. In a statement to the Southern Poverty Law Center, \u201cForever Lee Circle\u201d creator \u201cMikas Eaux\u201d insisted that \u201cthe beads serve as a conduit to take the stigma out of Southern history.\u201d\n\nAllies like Save Nola Heritage publicized the trinket as a fun, celebratory way to preserve history, deploying the hashtag #ThrowWhatchaWanna to equate the beads with free speech. But as progressives pointed out, the hashtag ironically evoked the upbeat, brassy jazz anthem \u201cDo Whatcha Wanna,\u201d by Rebirth Brass Band, which is composed entirely of Afro-Creole and African-American musical elements.\n\nThis bitter exchange may seem out of place for an event known for apolitical merrymaking, but the collision of race and revelry is actually in keeping with Mardi Gras\u2019 long racial history. It\u2019s not the first time that white supremacists have used the parade in service of their goals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, the parading tradition itself grows right out of white anxiety over mixing and mingling between free and enslaved, black and white, rich and immigrant.\n\nBefore the 1850s, the New Orleanian celebration was more akin to the Carnevale of Venice, with its egalitarian street-level revelry and festivities. Contemporaneous newspapers and travelers reported sensationalized violence and sexual depravity of new immigrant populations, especially the Irish (who had not yet become white), and the alleged intimacy between white \u201cladies\u201d and masked black men occurring during Carnival.\n\nAfter the Louisiana Purchase, the growing English-speaking, Protestant population attempted to curtail the Carnival tradition celebrated by the Catholic Creoles. Early attempts failed, but by 1856, a tentative alliance between white Americans and white Creoles of the city\u2019s slaveholding and professional classes established the Mistick Krewe of Comus and transformed Carnival into the form we know today, a preapproved parade route followed in a neat, linear fashion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1857 the Comus Krewe introduced the tableaux vivant, or living picture, to Mardi Gras, which featured members of the secret society in elaborate costumes and posed upon lavishly decorated floats. The original floats presented allegories from classic mythology and literature, such as Milton\u2019s Paradise Lost. Members were explicit about their motives\u2014in order to salvage Mardi Gras from what they saw as cultural degeneration, they presented the best of Anglophone culture and art and literally raised the city\u2019s elite white men to aspirational levels above the crowd.\n\nDuring Reconstruction, New Orleans\u2019 white elites used the pomp and ceremony of Mardi Gras to reassert symbolic and political control after the Confederacy\u2019s defeat. The Louisiana Constitution of 1868 ushered in desegregated schools and public transportation, recognized the citizenship of African Americans, and granted the right to vote and hold office to African-American men without property requirements. Local white men perceived this new racial equality as a threat and were eager to recapture their former power.\n\nCarnival krewes took their political arguments to the streets and manipulated their festive displays to provide evidence of the illegitimacy and incongruity of black citizenship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Crescent City Democratic Club, later renamed the Crescent City White League, whose stated goal was to prevent the \u201cAfricanization\u201d of New Orleans and Louisiana, formed the city\u2019s second krewe in 1870. The Twelfth Night Revelers regularly caricatured African-American lawmakers as bumbling crows or backward strongmen.\n\nComus presented its infamous \u201cthe Missing Links to Darwin\u2019s Origin of Species\u201d and \u201cthe Aryan Race\u201d themes in 1873 and 1877, respectively. The former theme culminated with an anthropomorphic crowned gorilla standing in contrast against a white Comus, suggesting the innate inferiority of black men holding civic office. In like fashion, the Knights of Momus displayed comical yet grotesque representations of mixed-race people among equally grotesque animal hybrids in its 1873 parade themed \u201cthe Coming Races.\u201d\n\nMardi Gras had become a mode by which former slaveholders and Confederate sympathizers could maintain symbolic power and communicate ideas of white supremacy, social Darwinism and the \u201cLost Cause\u201d even under the city\u2019s interracial Republican government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOver the last century, African Americans, women and LGBTQ people have all established parading organizations that have at times directly and indirectly challenged the elite white male control of Mardi Gras.\n\nIn recent years, there has been searing political satire of the response to Hurricane Katrina and the 2016 election. This progress, however, only further demonstrates how the revelry and debauchery of Carnival does not have an inherent political bent. Carnival is a fluid, flexible form and, thus, allows for both progressive and prejudiced values to flourish. This year, my social media newsfeed was filled with posts bemoaning the Knights of Chaos\u2019 floats lampooning Colin Kaepernick, kneeling NFL players and Dreamers.\n\nIn the end, sometimes racism looks like swastikas and tiki torches, but sometimes it looks like a parade.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrederick Staidum Jr., Ph.D., is a scholar of 19th-century American culture and literature at Loyola University Chicago and a Public Voices Fellow with the Op-Ed Project.

At its core, the series focuses on the lives of those behind the costumes, and their endeavors to overcome real-world issues. \u201cI could not be more excited by the opportunity to excavate the canon of the DC Universe through a vast array of characters who\u2019ve earned their seat at the table,\u201d explains Ridley. \u201cI\u2019m very impressed with DC\u2019s commitment to making their history as reverent and urgent as it is engaging and entertaining for all its many fans.\u201d THE OTHER HISTORY OF THE DC UNIVERSE isn\u2019t about saving the world, it\u2019s about having the strength to simply be who you are. Ridley will discuss his latest project for the first time this weekend on DC in D.C.\u2019s \u201cThe Many Shades of Heroism: DC Heroes Through the African-American Lens\u201d panel. DC in D.C. is a landmark pop culture event illuminating the story of America and current issues through the lens of comics and Super Heroes. Tune in via the live stream on Saturday, January 13, at 11 a.m. ET on the DC YouTube channel and follow along in the conversation on social media with #dcindc2018. The new miniseries is slated to launch in winter 2018, following Ridley\u2019s current run at Vertigo with THE AMERICAN WAY: THOSE ABOVE AND THOSE BELOW. Additional details will be provided over the coming months\u2014check dccomics.com for updates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRidley\u2019s current American Way project is the sequel to a 2006 miniseries and has looked at how living with racism and political oppression affects the motivations of people with superpowers. (I\u2019ve been talking with him about it in a series of interviews.) If The Other History of the DC Universe channels that same ethos, it should be a very fresh and energetic look at characters who\u2019ve stood apart from their peers.", "keywords": ["heroes", "john", "marginalized", "project", "miniseries", "superheroes", "ridleys", "way", "history", "tell", "dc", "series", "universe", "ridley", "personal"], "polarity": 0.1741012396694215, "subjectivity": 0.4233889216843762},

Some of the infamous beads thrown into the crowds reflected the image of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee to protest the removal of his statue from New Orleans\u2019 most prominent traffic circle, which has been a symbolic focal point of parade routes\u2014hence the bead\u2019s name, \u201cForever Lee Circle.\u201d\n\n\n\nThere were also Confederate-flag beads, T-shirts and an old image of the statue clandestinely projected on to City Hall. The Lee monument was removed by Mayor Mitch Landrieu on May 19, 2017, after steady pressure from the #TakeEmDownNOLA movement.\n\n\n\nInitially, the bead controversy mostly played out on local blogs and social media, but concerns over racism at Mardi Gras intensified this week after blackface figurines began popping up. In a statement to the Southern Poverty Law Center, \u201cForever Lee Circle\u201d creator \u201cMikas Eaux\u201d insisted that \u201cthe beads serve as a conduit to take the stigma out of Southern history.\u201d\n\nAllies like Save Nola Heritage publicized the trinket as a fun, celebratory way to preserve history, deploying the hashtag #ThrowWhatchaWanna to equate the beads with free speech. But as progressives pointed out, the hashtag ironically evoked the upbeat, brassy jazz anthem \u201cDo Whatcha Wanna,\u201d by Rebirth Brass Band, which is composed entirely of Afro-Creole and African-American musical elements.\n\nThis bitter exchange may seem out of place for an event known for apolitical merrymaking, but the collision of race and revelry is actually in keeping with Mardi Gras\u2019 long racial history. It\u2019s not the first time that white supremacists have used the parade in service of their goals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, the parading tradition itself grows right out of white anxiety over mixing and mingling between free and enslaved, black and white, rich and immigrant.\n\nBefore the 1850s, the New Orleanian celebration was more akin to the Carnevale of Venice, with its egalitarian street-level revelry and festivities. Contemporaneous newspapers and travelers reported sensationalized violence and sexual depravity of new immigrant populations, especially the Irish (who had not yet become white), and the alleged intimacy between white \u201cladies\u201d and masked black men occurring during Carnival.\n\nAfter the Louisiana Purchase, the growing English-speaking, Protestant population attempted to curtail the Carnival tradition celebrated by the Catholic Creoles. Early attempts failed, but by 1856, a tentative alliance between white Americans and white Creoles of the city\u2019s slaveholding and professional classes established the Mistick Krewe of Comus and transformed Carnival into the form we know today, a preapproved parade route followed in a neat, linear fashion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1857 the Comus Krewe introduced the tableaux vivant, or living picture, to Mardi Gras, which featured members of the secret society in elaborate costumes and posed upon lavishly decorated floats. The original floats presented allegories from classic mythology and literature, such as Milton\u2019s Paradise Lost. Members were explicit about their motives\u2014in order to salvage Mardi Gras from what they saw as cultural degeneration, they presented the best of Anglophone culture and art and literally raised the city\u2019s elite white men to aspirational levels above the crowd.\n\nDuring Reconstruction, New Orleans\u2019 white elites used the pomp and ceremony of Mardi Gras to reassert symbolic and political control after the Confederacy\u2019s defeat. The Louisiana Constitution of 1868 ushered in desegregated schools and public transportation, recognized the citizenship of African Americans, and granted the right to vote and hold office to African-American men without property requirements. Local white men perceived this new racial equality as a threat and were eager to recapture their former power.\n\nCarnival krewes took their political arguments to the streets and manipulated their festive displays to provide evidence of the illegitimacy and incongruity of black citizenship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Crescent City Democratic Club, later renamed the Crescent City White League, whose stated goal was to prevent the \u201cAfricanization\u201d of New Orleans and Louisiana, formed the city\u2019s second krewe in 1870. The Twelfth Night Revelers regularly caricatured African-American lawmakers as bumbling crows or backward strongmen.\n\nComus presented its infamous \u201cthe Missing Links to Darwin\u2019s Origin of Species\u201d and \u201cthe Aryan Race\u201d themes in 1873 and 1877, respectively. The former theme culminated with an anthropomorphic crowned gorilla standing in contrast against a white Comus, suggesting the innate inferiority of black men holding civic office. In like fashion, the Knights of Momus displayed comical yet grotesque representations of mixed-race people among equally grotesque animal hybrids in its 1873 parade themed \u201cthe Coming Races.\u201d\n\nMardi Gras had become a mode by which former slaveholders and Confederate sympathizers could maintain symbolic power and communicate ideas of white supremacy, social Darwinism and the \u201cLost Cause\u201d even under the city\u2019s interracial Republican government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOver the last century, African Americans, women and LGBTQ people have all established parading organizations that have at times directly and indirectly challenged the elite white male control of Mardi Gras.\n\nIn recent years, there has been searing political satire of the response to Hurricane Katrina and the 2016 election. This progress, however, only further demonstrates how the revelry and debauchery of Carnival does not have an inherent political bent. Carnival is a fluid, flexible form and, thus, allows for both progressive and prejudiced values to flourish. This year, my social media newsfeed was filled with posts bemoaning the Knights of Chaos\u2019 floats lampooning Colin Kaepernick, kneeling NFL players and Dreamers.\n\nIn the end, sometimes racism looks like swastikas and tiki torches, but sometimes it looks like a parade.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrederick Staidum Jr., Ph.D., is a scholar of 19th-century American culture and literature at Loyola University Chicago and a Public Voices Fellow with the Op-Ed Project.

It\u2019s the Southern-white-man thing to do to champion the losers of the Confederacy.\n\n\n\nSo, on Monday, when Virginia state Sen. Emmett W. Hanger Jr. (R-Augusta) stood up to lionize the birthday of Confederate Gen. Thomas J. \u201cStonewall\u201d Jackson during a state Senate meeting, Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax, Virginia\u2019s first black statewide elected official since Douglas Wilder in 1989, quietly walked off the dais, as he didn\u2019t want to be disrespectful, but as a black man in the South, he didn\u2019t want to hear that shit.\n\nFairfax bounced, and Sen. Stephen D. Newman (R-Bedford), the Senate pro tempore, moved into Fairfax\u2019s place.\n\nThe Washington Post reports that Fairfax\u2019s exit was so smooth, many senators didn\u2019t even realize it was a protest move.\n\n\u201cThere are people in Virginia history that I think it\u2019s appropriate to memorialize and remember that way, and others that I would have a difference of opinion on,\u201d he told reporters afterward, the Post reports. \u201cI just wanted to, in a very respectful but very definite way, make it clear that these were not adjournment motions that I felt comfortable presiding over, and I was not going to do it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Post notes that Fairfax knew beforehand that the move to commemorate both Jackson and Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee was coming, and since he presides over the Senate, he informed some members of his plans to hand over the gavel so as not to be a part of the shenanigans commemorating those who wanted to enslave his ancestors.\n\nHere\u2019s how the Post described Fairfax\u2019s decision to protest as well as Virginia\u2019s history of honoring those who fought to continue slavery:\n\nFairfax described his protest as a \u201cpersonal decision\u201d based, in part, on his family history. Tucked in his jacket pocket when he was sworn in as lieutenant governor on Jan. 13 was the manumission document that freed his enslaved ancestors in 1798. Honoring Confederate figures and other prominent Virginians is nothing unusual for either Republicans or Democrats in the former capital of the Confederacy. Comedian Stephen Colbert lampooned the Virginia Senate in 2013 for adjourning its Martin Luther King Jr. Day session in honor of Jackson\u2014on a motion from a Democrat, Sen. R. Creigh Deeds of Bath. Such tributes have become more politically charged amid the push to remove monuments and rename schools and roads honoring Confederate leaders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut why would Fairfax\u2019s presence as only the second black man to be elected statewide stop tradition or the history of honoring white men who fought for the losing side?\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve done this numerous times before, and I expect that someone on this floor has repeated this tradition here in the General Assembly every year\u2014perhaps 155 times over 155 years since Jackson was killed in battle and lay in state here behind me down the hall in this Capitol,\u201d Hanger, whose great-great-grandfather served with Jackson in the Stonewall Brigade, said during his speech.\n\n\u201cAnd yet today is different,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all know it and we struggle to hide our discomfort\u2014discomfort with people who have given disgusting voice and vile action to the racism and bigotry that seemingly respectable people have managed to hide in their hearts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cJackson was not a perfect man,\u201d Hanger said, the Post reports. \u201cAs a devout Christian, he had conflicting views on slavery. But there\u2019s no questioning the fact that in his short life, he became one of the most respected military leaders the modern world has known.\u201d\n\nI love how Hanger notes that Stonewall Jackson was a Christian with \u201cconflicting views on slavery,\u201d or how about he was a slave owner who never freed any of the slaves he owned, and when he went to fight for the side of America that wanted to expand slavery, his wife rented his slaves to neighbors because she found them difficult to \u201ccontrol\u201d without her husband\u2019s help.\n\nYeah, I\u2019m with Fairfax, and fuck this tribute and the retelling of history that completely tries to whitewash the racist past of horrible men.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at the Washington Post.", "keywords": ["heroes", "virginia", "fairfaxs", "confederate", "hanger", "sorry", "justin", "wanted", "lt", "history", "wax", "gov", "fairfax", "post", "white", "jackson", "honoring", "poetic", "senate", "hear"], "polarity": 0.020267489711934157, "subjectivity": 0.4388683127572018},

I asked four friends, who usually love going to the movies, to go to the Justice League screening and the collective answers were \u201cI\u2019ve got Bible study,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m mentoring\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m sleeping,\u201d until finally someone said, \u201cI guess, since the theater\u2019s near my house.\u201d\n\nWhen we got there, a young black woman who worked for the promotions company was taking the tickets when I heard someone loudly playing Vince Staples\u2019 \u201cBagBak,\u201d the song from the second Black Panther trailer. The woman was literally watching the Black Panther trailer on her phone while collecting tickets to see Justice League. If that\u2019s not some passive-aggressive \u201cThis movie is trash and I\u2019m just here till February so I don\u2019t get fined\u201d Black Girl Magic, I don\u2019t know what is.\n\nTurns out the signs were right: Justice League is terrible, the action sequences are bad, the cast has no chemistry and it\u2019s a CGI nightmare in most parts. I know you\u2019re going to see it anyway, but here\u2019s what you\u2019re setting yourself up for.\n\n\n\nThe plot of Justice League is perfectly serviceable: Batman (Ben Affleck) forms a team of heroes he\u2019s been hinting at for three movies to stop an alien invasion. The problem is with everything else. We\u2019re now five movies into the DC Comics universe (Man of Steel, Suicide Squad, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and Wonder Woman), and none of these films have a firm handle on who these characters really are. When you bring them all together, it\u2019s like awkward speed dating more than team building.\n\nIs Cyborg (he and his dad are apparently the only speaking black people in the DC Universe) a brooding internet Frankenstein or is he the \u201cbooyah\u201d-loving kid from Teen Titans Go? Is Ezra Miller\u2019s Flash the anxious kid haunted by his dad\u2019s imprisonment or is he the quirky Ross-from-Friends, Jesse Eisenberg-in-every-movie trope, forcing \u201ccomedy relief\u201d down our throats? And Bat-fleck? The guy who is supposedly obsessed with bringing the team together but has given every indication that he wants out of the franchise? I\u2019m not saying he phoned in his performance, but his effort was about as consistent as T-Mobile on the subway.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs little as the characters are actually together in movie time (maybe two days tops), it\u2019s hard to see any camaraderie. Mind you, this is a superhero movie, not Moonlight\u2014as long as the action is good and it\u2019s visually appealing, it should be salvageable, right? Unfortunately, the action scenes and character designs are lousy, too, and suffer from a serious case of doing too much.\n\nThe problem starts with Flash (who is never actually called that name in the movie) and permeates the entire film. Between Quicksilver in X-Men: Days of Future Past and Quicksilver in Avengers: Age of Ultron, Hollywood has produced some really fascinating effects for showing superspeedsters. Justice League muddles everything about the Flash by only showing his powers in slow motion and constantly circling him in electricity, and he seldom interacts with anything that\u2019s not CGI.\n\nIn Justice League\u2019s first battle as a \u201cteam,\u201d there is a tepid attempt to re-create parts of the incredible shootout scene from X-Men: Days of Future Past (right up to running along the walls). However, in Justice League, someone decided that it\u2019s more fun to blur the entire background, slow everything down and make it almost impossible to contrast Flash\u2019s speed with the world around him. You should never be watching an action sequence with the Flash and think to yourself, \u201cWill he just hurry up?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead of giving Cyborg (Ray Fisher) a RoboCop physique that is a mixture of flesh and machine, Justice League designs him like a first-generation Cylon from Battlestar Galactica, complete with a lack of genitals or flesh (which adds some interesting racial subtext to the furtive glances between Cyborg and Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot). (Have to make sure the tin black man with the genius IQ and the athletic background will never have sex!)\n\nDespite being crucial to the plot, Cyborg is the only Justice Leaguer who can\u2019t consistently control his powers, and when he does, it looks clunky. Two of the three big fight scenes in Justice League occur in dark places or with a rusted red-and-orange background, which gives the film\u2019s big set pieces a lack of depth and a drab feeling. You\u2019ll see the contrast in these poor cinematic choices at work in Batman\u2019s dark and confusing opening fight with a CGI Parademon, compared with Wonder Woman\u2019s amazing takedown of some actual real-life bank robbers. (Wonder Woman\u2019s opening is the second-best action sequence in any DC movie behind Man of Steel\u2019s superhuman fight in Smallville.)\n\nFinally, maybe somebody at Warner Bros. has stock in black pixel footage, or maybe somebody in production has a weird obsession with hentai, but this is the third DC movie (Man of Steel, Suicide Squad and now Justice League) in which some large black tentacle thing has to be defeated in order to save the world. It\u2019s getting kind of weird.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWas there anything to like about Justice League? A little. There is a semibig surprise near the middle of the movie with a really fun action scene and fight that hasn\u2019t been spoiled by trailers. The whole setup could\u2019ve been a game changer had it lasted longer and the chemistry between characters been better. Aquaman doing his best Khal Drogo/Wolverine impression by running around shirtless seemed to impress a few people in the audience.\n\nThere were a few witty lines of dialogue, but you\u2019ve seen most of the punchlines in the trailers, so they weren\u2019t as funny in the movie. The movie sets up the Flash and Aquaman for their own films (but not Cyborg), so if the movie is a huge success, those spinoff films will be coming for fans. There are a few references to other DC superheroes that may appear down the line if the movie is successful enough. Honestly, though, the way Justice League ends, there isn\u2019t any real indication as to why this group would need to team up again except for another cash grab, no matter what the two post-credit scenes try to hint at.\n\nIf you have to see something before Thanksgiving weekend, I suspect you could drag yourself to see this movie, but I would recommend Justice League for \u201cRedbox and chill.\u201d That way you won\u2019t be mad about the $2 you spent.", "keywords": ["youre", "going", "desperate", "flash", "wonder", "league", "grab", "cyborg", "dc", "money", "justice", "trash", "action", "team", "black", "movie"], "polarity": 0.04552579365079365, "subjectivity": 0.4982953042328042},

He is the very first mainstream black superhero ever to appear in and receive his own comic book series. His story arcs have tackled xenophobia, white supremacy, apartheid, geopolitics and everything in between.\n\nAnd while Stan \u201cthe man\u201d Lee and Jack \u201cKing\u201d Kirby deserve all credit due for his creation\u2014and his debut in Fantastic Four No. 52 (in July 1966, roughly three months before the Black Panther Party officially adopted its name)\u2014it was the writers in later decades who really seemed to shape the man and the mythology we see on the screen. Writers like Christopher Priest, Reginald Hudlin and, most recently, Ta-Nehisi Coates have greatly influenced the character of the last few decades in the books and what we see on film.\n\nBut this is an event worth remarking on because it is a first in so many aspects. It is the first big-budget superhero film from a major studio to star and feature a predominantly black cast, a black director, black screenwriters, a black executive producer and a black wardrobe designer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, it\u2019s a given that most of the film-viewing world\u2019s introduction to the warrior-king named T\u2019Challa was through 2016\u2019s Captain America: Civil War. He was arguably the breakout character of that film, leading many to remark, \u201cWhoa, who is that guy?\u201d upon his debut. But this wasn\u2019t the first Marvel movie reference to the Panther.\n\nInterestingly enough, the existence of the Panther was hinted at as far back as 2010\u2019s Iron Man 2, where his fictional homeland of Wakanda was shown on a map as a place Nick Fury was surveilling. It has also been confirmed that T\u2019Challa has been the current Panther since at least 2008.\n\nBut Civil War was when eagle-eyed fans understandably started asking, \u201cSo what\u2019s up with that movie though?\u201d to which Marvel came back with the highly suspect response at the time that could be summed up as, \u201cUmmm ... well, we don\u2019t have the technology to create an accurate Wakanda right now ... but let us know what you think of Thor\u2019s majestic otherworldly realm of Asgard, the Kree homeworld, and Neverwhere in Guardians of the Galaxy!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I digress.\n\nAfter his Civil War appearance was met with overwhelmingly positive feedback, Marvel Studios finally green-lighted a Black Panther film.\n\nT\u2019Challa and Wakanda\u2019s mythology are potent symbols on multiple levels.\n\nIn T\u2019Challa, you have essentially the ultimate overachiever ruling a veritable nation of overachievers. Here is a man who can trace his lineage back to 10 millennia of warrior kings and queens.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWakanda itself has a proud legacy based on its being not only the sole place on Earth where the fictional metal vibranium (the substance Captain America\u2019s shield is composed of) can be found, but also a society that has blended nature and technology to such an advanced stage, it is centuries ahead of anywhere else on the planet. This is in no small part due to Wakanda\u2019s never knowing the horrors of colonialism. It\u2019s literally a nation of the unconquered.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t for lack of trying by nearly everyone. Rival African nations, Belgian slave traders and honest-to-goodness extraterrestrial invaders (the intergalactic Skrull Empire and emissaries of the Mad Titan, Thanos, no less) all tried, and failed, in the comics to take over the African nation.\n\nBut, ultimately, with Black Panther the character, the thing that most strongly resonates for me is the idea that this is a superhero who is self-empowered. Even in his first cinematic appearance in Captain America: Civil War, you never get the sense that he is getting swept up in the other characters\u2019 stories. It\u2019s very clear that he has his own agenda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, as much as characters like James Rhodes (War Machine) and Sam Wilson (the Falcon) are satisfactory heroes in their own right, they seem mainly there to support Tony Stark and Steve Rogers, respectively. Also, their particular gimmicks are bestowed upon them through technology\u2014technology of which neither is the creator.\n\nWhich means that if they lose their gadgets, they are essentially powerless.\n\nInterestingly, Sam \u201cthe Falcon\u201d Wilson in the Ultimate Marvel series of books, which the Marvel Cinematic Universe was heavily influenced by, was the creator of the flight harness that gives him the ability to fly. However, for some reason, they decided not to include this as part of the character\u2019s backstory in the films.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCompare this with Black Panther\u2019s powers: He was a peak-level human mentally and physically before any enhancements. He possesses elite Olympic athletic abilities and has multiple degrees, including a Ph.D. from Oxford in physics. He is considered to be one of the most brilliant minds on Earth. The Black Panther title is a rank of office. The habit he wears is a mark of status as the protector and spiritual leader of Wakanda and the Panther Cult.\n\nAfter undergoing the trials that all Black Panthers must overcome, he earns the right to consume a heart-shaped herb indigenous to Wakanda that further enhances his already formidable abilities to superhuman levels. The herb is roughly analogous to the super soldier serum that is responsible for Captain America\u2019s powers. This plant, however, is toxic to anyone who is not a member of the royal bloodline. So if you aren\u2019t genetically related to Bashenga, the first leader of the Panther Cult 10,000 years ago, you will suffer potentially lethal side effects and no benefit from eating the plant. (It has recently been revealed that Bashenga is the second being in history to hold the Black Panther title and is predated by another in 1,000,000. Don\u2019t ask. It gets even weirder.)\n\nHow weird will the movie get? It\u2019s delving into the realm of utopian Afrofuturism, something we\u2019ve never really seen on this scale in a motion picture. In fact, it\u2019s pretty likely that Black Panther, the film, will be sui generis, completely unlike anything we\u2019ve seen on film before (and quite a few reviews bear this out).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo don\u2019t be ashamed to get hyped, get your tickets and get somewhat initiated into the Panther Cult via this filmgoing experience\u2014something I\u2019ve been into since childhood (and not just because my last name almost spells \u201cpanther\u201d). Because for comic readers like me, the reality of Black Panther and Wakanda getting their due in a multimillion-dollar sci-fi spectacular is the culmination of a lifelong dream that has me saying, \u201cLong live the king,\u201d but also, long live this dream of black excellence personified.\n\nJada Prather is an educator, artist and illustrator based in Washington, D.C., by way of New York City.

A mix of pick-up trucks and sedans flying the Confederate Battle Flag began to trickle in. In a few minutes, the manager of the Walmart, flanked by multiple police officers, would ask them to leave. (\u201cIt\u2019s private property,\u201d he\u2019d say.) But at 10:30 am, a group of about 15 Dixie Freedom Riders were still huddled in a circle, puffing on cigarettes and preparing to drive a few miles north to Memphis, where they would protest what they considered the illegal removal of two Confederate monuments.\n\nLast month, the Memphis city council voted in favor of transferring ownership of two public parks to a recently formed non-profit organization called Greenspace, Inc, who bought them for $1,000 each. Within hours of the vote on December 20, the city had removed statues of Confederate president Jefferson Davis and Confederate general (and early Ku Klux Klan member) Nathan Bedford Forrest.\n\nIn the wake of the controversy, a Facebook group calling itself Confederate 901 put out a call for protesters to meet in Memphis on January 6. But after missing the city\u2019s deadline to apply for a protest permit, Confederate 901 decided instead to caravan through Memphis and display Confederate flags from their vehicles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping to bring the African-American community and the white community\u2014you know, all communities together as one,\u201d said Confederate supporter Renee Land as she waited in the Walmart parking lot Saturday morning. \u201cWe don\u2019t want our history removed. If you\u2019re going to remove that statue, then let\u2019s just go all over entire United States to remove every statue we have.\u201d\n\nBilly Sessions, a Confederate activist and an organizer of the Memphis protest, also disavowed any association with white nationalist groups.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe Confederacy, the history has been twisted on that, but we\u2019re all Southerners,\u201d Sessions said later. \u201cNo matter what color you are, we\u2019re all Southerners. It\u2019s not about racism. It might have been about racism hundreds of years ago when the slave ships come across the Atlantic, but it\u2019s not anymore. The white supremacists have hijacked the Confederate flag and it has been seen as a symbol of hate, but it never intentionally was.\u201d\n\n\n\nBilly Roper of The Shield Wall Network, who also showed up in Memphis that day, has a different view. Roper is a self-proclaimed white nationalist who the Southern Poverty Law Center describes as \u201cthe uncensored voice of violent neo-Nazism.\u201d Roper is known for his unabashed use of racist, anti-Semitic language and violent rhetoric, at times suggesting that genocide and eugenics should be considered as potential tools to create an all-white ethno-state within the borders of United States. \u201cEthnic cleansing is no new concept,\u201d he said during the Memphis protest. \u201cIt\u2019s always been human nature.\u201d\n\nThe way he saw it, the Shield Wall Network was here to nudge the Confederate activists in the right direction. \u201cMy job is to be as extreme as I can be legally,\u201d he said. \u201cMy radical flank works to make Confederate 901 more radical and extreme.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt one point during the day, Billy Roper and a group of about a dozen supporters managed to post up just outside of Health Sciences Park, formerly known as Forrest Park. Once there, they unfurled a banner: \u201cDiversity = White Genocide.\u201d\n\n\n\nBy 10 am on Saturday, it was clear that the City of Memphis had no intention of turning this protest into another Charlottesville. A quarter-mile perimeter was established around the park with various checkpoints that included metal detectors and an extensive police presence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe violence some community members feared never materialized as counter-protesters from Take \u2018Em Down 901, the NAACP, and other city and civic leaders urged residents not to engage, instead calling for a day of community service.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTami Sawyer, founder of Take \u2018Em Down 901 and political planning chair of the Memphis Branch of the NAACP, posted a message to Facebook on Friday evening: \u201cWhile some will choose to ride around and gather in the name of hatred and white supremacy, we are calling for all Memphis to \u2018show up!\u2019 But don\u2019t show up by protesting, counter protesters. Show up by taking this opportunity to show the world that we work together to serve our community.\u201d\n\nBy Saturday morning the hashtag #SHOWUPMEMPHIS began to circulate on social media. Sawyer said she drew inspiration from the efforts of Take \u2018Em Down NOLA in New Orleans where the city saw the removal of three confederate monuments in May.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019d been on the front lines for three or four years and saw no change,\u201d Sawyer said. \u201cI was encouraged to think of a small change that might be able to happen in the short term and I immediately focused on the monuments.\u201d\n\n\n\nBy 3 pm on Saturday, only a small pocket of anti-racist activists had come and gone. Neither the protesters nor the counter-protesters had the opportunity to lay eyes on one another. The Confederate 901 caravan never drove into the city, opting only to make a continuous loop around the I-240 for two hours before stopping at a rally point to disband outside of the city.\n\n\u201cWe did it and it was peaceful,\u201d said Billy Sessions as he sat back in his chair, exhausted and dazed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBack at a smoky hotel room in Arkansas a few minutes outside Memphis, Sessions, along with members of \u201cpatriot\u201d organizations Hiwaymen, the Carolina Defenders, and the leadership of Confederate 901, shared stories over beer.\n\nBut the protesters couldn\u2019t completely relax. They\u2019d received a number of threats on social media during the day, they said. A Springfield XD handgun sat on the nightstand, a remnant of the tension earlier that day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe night that the statues came down, I was angry,\u201d said George, a Confederate 901 organizer, who didn\u2019t want to give his last name. \u201cI\u2019m a real big history guy and a big fan of Nathan Bedford Forrest. I\u2019ve even been up there to clean the statue and I\u2019ve put flowers on his grave for the past four or five years. I have a great respect for him.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI know how inner-city Memphis is,\u201d added James Del Brock, co-founder of the Hiwaymen. \u201cI\u2019ve drove through a lot of it. I\u2019ve drove through it with my motorcycle and battle flag. I\u2019ve always wanted to know, because I\u2019m a white person, how to reach into the inner city without getting shot.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs they sipped their beers, the protesters signed a Confederate flag. The founder of the Carolina Defenders, who offered his first name, Tom, made a point to note that the signatures were in commemoration, not desecration.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t sit back and watch it anymore,\u201d Tom said. \u201cThere\u2019s a point where every American has to stand up and say, \u2018Look, our kids aren\u2019t going to have a future or anything to look forward to if the constitution keeps getting trashed the way it is.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOverall, though, the mood was hopeful. A man who would only identify himself as Phillip and the founder of Confederate 901 says the group is seeking 501c3 status. They recently received a $10,000 donation from a single donor. \u201cThe money is coming in,\u201d he said proudly.\n\nThis feature is part of Splinter\u2019s project to recruit local, embedded reporters, essayists, and photographers across the country.

Now, if you consult your history books, you\u2019ll find that Ohio was a Union state during the Civil War. Which makes the fact that the township installed a marker in 1927 honoring Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee all the more peculiar.\n\nAnd so it was until August, WKYC reports, when the neighboring town, Franklin, removed the monument after a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., turned deadly.\n\nAccording to WKYC, the marker was removed by a Franklin city crew, since they controlled the area where the marker was located.\n\nBut some Franklin Township residents got big mad about the removal. According to a USA Today article from August, residents blamed Black Lives Matter for the monument\u2019s removal\u2014even though the organization doesn\u2019t have any presence in the town.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom USA Today:\n\nSome say the monument should return because it has historic value. Some embrace President Donald Trump\u2019s controversial comments after Charlottesville and say they\u2019re sick of \u201cpolitical correctness.\u201d And some say they simply don\u2019t want outsiders, like those who signed the petition, telling them what to do. \u201cI think they should just leave things alone,\u201d said Judy Vullen, who\u2019s lived in Franklin for 45 years and didn\u2019t know the monument existed until it was removed last weekend. \u201cIt\u2019s wrong what they did.\u201d\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause fools and their Confederate monuments are not soon parted, the Lee monument will be returned to be reinstalled and rededicated.

Maybe you know that the Oscar-winning writer/producer behind those works also scripts comics, too. Last week at San Diego Comic-Con, John Ridley talked about why.\n\n\n\nRidley was at Comic-Con, at least in part, to talk up The American Way: Those Above and Those Below, a miniseries just kicked off by DC Comics. It\u2019s a sequel to a 2006 miniseries that centered on how the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s impacted a government-sponsored superhero program. Ridley\u2019s work often harbors an unflinching focus on how racial politics complicate individual lives and social histories, and both American Way series explore how that complication would become even greater for people who are superpowered symbols.\n\nI spoke with Ridley in the Hard Rock Hotel in downtown San Diego. Comic-Con fills up just about everywhere with loud, raucous revelry and Ridley offered to take a walk with me to find a quieter place to talk. The chaos was everywhere, though, so he just wound up holding my phone close to his face and mine to make sure we were both heard. Here\u2019s what we talked about.\n\n\n\nThe Origins for Story and Creator\n\nThe American Way happens in its own pocket universe. I asked Ridley about the origination of the first series, and the kind of impulses he was trying to work out in this fiction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJohn Ridley: Part of it just came from my love of comic books. I was a kid growing up, we\u2019d be reading them\u2014they were fantastic. I mean that literally and figuratively. That space where what writers and artists could do was absolutely amazing. I was a younger man in the mid-\u201880s when I think there was a real shift in the quality and the auteurship. Obviously Watchmen and The Dark Knight Returns, but in particular The Question series by Dennis O\u2019Neil and Denys Cowan. I just thought it was amazing, the grayness of it all. The fact that it was meant to be\u2014just from irony\u2014 The Question is not about answers. It was just this guy out there, struggling. And I thought it was absolutely amazing.\n\nBut as a younger man, too, I remember when Black Lightning showed up. And I didn\u2019t read a lot of Marvel as a kid so I didn\u2019t see a lot of heroes of color that had pre-existed, so in the DC Universe, that was a big deal. John Stewart was around and he was always terrific. But it was always weird having the black replacement hero. So, for me, there were those elements of the quality of storytelling, the impact of just comic books in general, but also just what it was like for me when a hero of color arrived.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI wanted to combine all those thoughts and feelings into a story. I\u2019ve always loved history. And I\u2019ve always loved history because there was a certain resolve. You know, part of\u2014obviously\u2014science fiction/fantasy is about being speculative about tomorrow, about possibilities. Where history is about examining the things that did happen in certain realities.\n\nAnd there was a story from history that I was aware of. Where Lyndon Johnson had gone to Kennedy and said, \u201cLook\u2014our biggest issues are not the Cubans or Russia\u2014it\u2019s race relations. It\u2019s integration.\u201d And when we see people being exceptional\u2014there are always going to be deniers\u2014but it makes it that much harder to deny. What if one of the astronauts was a black man? And what would that mean? And showing him working with and for the best and the brightest. So, ironically, Kennedy was like, \u201cYeah, that ain\u2019t going to happen.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I thought that was an interesting departure point, that like the space program\u2014which had very real-world applications\u2014was also a bit agitprop. A lot of it was, \u201cWe\u2019re going to the moon to show how great we are as Americans.\u201d What if they did that with superheroes? Where a lot of it was certainly real, but part of what their mandate for existence was simply to make Americans feel good about themselves. And what if, in this new administration\u2014new being the Kennedy administration\u2014they said, \u201cYou know what we gotta do? We gotta bring in a black hero.\u201d\n\nSo that\u2019s where we began. A love of comic books, a love of history, a moment for me, when I was able to pick up a comic and go, \u201cOh, this is more specific in its representation.\u201d But also to make sure the story was fantastic. And I don\u2019t just mean a good read, but that when you read comic books, the art, the thru all of it, everything that is happening, the buyer deserves to have something that\u2019s fantastic.\n\n\n\nThe Times, They Are A-Changin\u2019\n\nThe American Way: Those Above and Those Below follows members of the Civil Defense Corps after the government-sponsored superteam is dissolved. They\u2019re trying to find some purpose in normal life but their status as larger-than-life figures makes that hard, especially during a time of socio-political upheaval.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nio9: In this new series, you\u2019re acting in an analogous timeline where the hope and optimism of the Space Race era curdled after Martin Luther King was assassinated. In the real world, people started violently venting their frustrations in American cities. You have the same kind of things happening in this series, even though it\u2019s set in the \u201870s, correct?\n\n\n\nRidley: Yeah, the second series is set 10 years later [in] 1972. But you\u2019re absolutely correct; the beginning of the 1960s was nothing but optimism. The middle to later part of the 1960s was certainly a lot of agitation, but with the hope that MLK\u2019s passive, non-violent resistance would show people there\u2019s a better way. By the end of the \u201860s and in the \u201870s, there was just a cynicism and a disregard. Even though the Vietnam War was winding down, and even though there were some gains in civil rights, there were a lot of people who said, \u201cIt\u2019s not enough,\u201d and \u201cThe peace movement does not work,\u201d thinking we\u2019ve got to fight it out. So that\u2019s where we see these primary characters of Jason Fisher, Amber Headen, and Missy Deveroux. They\u2019re in these three different spaces, but dealing with the realities of the world where the optimism they were part of is stripped away, and you\u2019re left with nothing but cynicism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nio9: It\u2019s funny, because black superhero characters used to be locked into either a ghettofied, blaxploitation mode or a concept where they need to \u201crise above\u201d that, which is an inherently racist notion in and of itself. How are you going to tackle that tension within this series?\n\nRidley: It\u2019s difficult, because, unfortunately, when we tell these stories, even in 2017, characters who are black or Hispanic, or Muslim or another orientation, they\u2019re still rather singular. They stand in for the whole population. So there are absolutely elements, and I don\u2019t want to talk about any particular hero that\u2019s out there, but, there are moments where I go, \u201cWhy does he have to be that guy?\u201d\n\n\n\nBut you realize there\u2019s not an opportunity for there to be 15, 20, 25 of them, but the ones that achieve some cultural density still are fairly singular. So what we want to try to do is\u2014with regard to representations of different aspects of different thought\u2014is hopefully say, \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to be any one thing to all people, we hope within this story that we embrace the complex nature.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd I think in the first issue, you can see between Jason and Evan, where Jason\u2019s going, \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d I\u2019m trying to do this. I\u2019m trying to do that. I\u2019m not necessarily trying to do this. And Evan is going, \u201cYeah, but you\u2019re still trying to make the world into your vision.\u201d So with that, you gotta take what comes with it.\n\nOn another space, we see Missy dealing with someone, in comparison, was progressive 10 years ago\u2014and I think we see a lot of that right now. People who may have voted one way in the last election go, \u201cWell, I gave that a chance and what did I get?\u201d It kind of boggles the mind. And then with Amber, someone who\u2019s just completely\u2014\u201cHey, you know what? Optimism doesn\u2019t work. Hope doesn\u2019t work. I need to go out and I need to bring the pain!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo what I think you\u2019re getting at is its\u2014trust me, [I\u2019ve] done it in many spaces\u2014it is very difficult to avoid people who come with an agenda in place. Jason is a black man, he\u2019s going to get compared to this black character or that one. but it is one of those things that as a storyteller, I can\u2019t help what people bring to it. I can hope what they bring away from it is more than what they thought initially, coming to the story.\n\nCrisis on Opposite Earths\n\nAdvertisement\n\nio9: You\u2019re publishing under DC now. How would the characters in this pocket universe of yours react to the characters of the mainline DC universe? Let\u2019s say Jason runs into Black Lightning, or Superman, or Batman;. How would that go down?\n\n\n\nRidley: First of all, I wish you were in charge of DC, for even bringing that up. It\u2019s interesting because I remember when Milestone had these crossover events, just that sense of\u201cThese folks are not distilled concepts of people of color, these are people of color speaking for themselves.\u201d And now they\u2019re going to a space where it\u2019s amazingly progressive and people are doing everything they can but the reaction was still like, \u201cHeeey, whoaaa...\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nio9: One of my favorites comics of all time is Icon #16, that\u2019s the one where Icon and Superman meet. And Icon is obviously a Superman analogue, right? Alien crashes on Earth... lands in a plantation in the 19th Century instead of a farm in 20th-Century Kansas. It was Dwayne [McDuffie] talking about white privilege before it was even a term, and essentially saying \u201cYou had the same journey but you get to be Superman because you look this way.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRidley: Your passport is already stamped. And mine never will be. To me, there would be very similar issues, whether it\u2019s Jason facing off against whoever\u2019s a bit more of a street-level hero, or whether Amber goes after Supergirl: \u201cYou\u2019ve got all the powers in the universe and you\u2019re still playing dress up!\u201d Or Missy saying to people, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to placate. There\u2019s nothing wrong with being proud of being white, it\u2019s not anti-black.\u201d\n\nTo me, to have characters who can say that in a very fundamental way, I think that\u2019s the big thing. A lot of people say, \u201cIt must be great\u201d\u2014and it is\u2014\u201dto be able to write a character like Jason.\u201d But it\u2019s equally great to write a character like Missy, and say, \u201cWell I\u2019m going to put this through my filter now...\u201d And here\u2019s how, to me, this character would represent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Lost Cause\n\nWhen DC Comics offered the opportunity to talk to Ridley, I knew I\u2019d have to ask him about Confederate, since the screenwriter\u2019s work has dealt with the transatlantic slave trade and written science fiction.\n\n\n\nio9: The things you said about speculative fiction have me wondering about your reaction to Confederate, the new show that got announced from the Game of Thrones producers. There\u2019s already been some pushback because they\u2019re dealing with an alternate universe where the Civil War ended one way\u2014there was a successful succession\u2014and slavery still exists. Would you mind giving me your thoughts?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRidley: [pauses for a long beat] Well, the preamble and the caveat is that I work in the space, I know some of these people, and I have to be genuinely diplomatic in what I say. Look, I never hope it\u2019s a litmus test in who can say what, who can write what kind of stories. I\u2019ve also told stories that have taken place in the American slave era, prior to the Civil Rights movement. But I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t say that I think that these folks\u2014if this is what they choose to tell a story about\u2014they\u2019re really going to have to rise to the occasion.\n\nI don\u2019t want to say that somehow people of color own every Civil Rights or slave story, or it can be told [only] one way. Again, I\u2019ve visited that time space so I can\u2019t say you shouldn\u2019t do it. But when you look at the lack of overall representation, to say that \u201cThis is what we\u2019re going to speculate about\u201d is a charged thing to say.\n\nKnowing that all of us have blind spots in terms of our storytelling, I think the makeup of the individuals who are going to be telling that story is important. Exceptional latitude is going to need to be given to other people to make sure there are other emotions that come through that are correct. I didn\u2019t live in 1849 when 12 Years a Slave was set, but I was working as someone who struggled to make sure that document was left behind. So I\u2019ve been on both sides of it. I get it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I also understand the personal amount of research or pain or baggage that I carry with me when we do things like Guerilla or American Crime, or whatever. So I look forward to all the people involved proving that they have the time, capacity, patience, to tell a story that surprises\u2014put that in bold and italics\u2014surprises all of us. I didn\u2019t come up with this idea, but if they\u2019re going to tell that story, then I look forward to being able to tell a story where there was no slavery, or where people of color were in charge.\n\nio9: Those stories exist, as with Steven Barnes\u2019 Lion\u2019s Blood books. I wonder if the green light would happen as easily with those adaptations\u2026.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRidley: That would be part of my thing. You know, I\u2019ve been blessed. I don\u2019t want to make this about me or the things I want to do, but, there\u2019s still that struggle for people of color to say, \u201cWhat about this?\u201d or, \u201cHow about that?\u201d And those sorts of works don\u2019t get the blessing of \u201cDo it! Go with that.\u201d\n\n\n\nA Question in Search of an Answer\n\nSteering the conversation back to comics, I asked Ridley if there were any characters in the DC Comics canon he\u2019d like to write.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRidley: I\u2019m very excited to see Black Lightning coming to television. Very excited to see Cyborg in Justice League. Very excited to see what his spinoff movie is going to be like. You know, in the DC Universe, those were the guys who arrived on the scene when I was just at that age, and I feel like they\u2019ve grown up in interesting ways. I\u2019d love to see Mr. Terrific. I love what he\u2019s about. I\u2019d love to see Vixen. I would love to see a...\n\n\n\nio9: She\u2019s right there waiting for someone to champion. She\u2019s been on some of the TV shows. But the story potential for her is so great; she\u2019s a supermodel with fantastic animal powers...\n\n\n\nRidley: Just everything about her. Not just in the writing; I can\u2019t help but think, \u201cWho would you cast as that part?\u201d At this moment, that\u2019s a character that needs to be a priority, as DC is sort of plotting out their movie universe. If it were me, the question is who are the easter eggs you want in that Cyborg movie? Mr. Terrific? You don\u2019t say a word about it, and when the movie comes out you say, \u201cOh, shit, is that Mr. Terrific?\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe one other character I already said I love: The Question. Why the Question does not have\u2014and I know I\u2019m saying something now that somebody else is going to repurpose and I\u2019ll lose out\u2014why the Question doesn\u2019t have a film is beyond me. I would do a Question film in a heartbeat.\n\n\n\nio9: I wrote an article about that specific run, which I also love. I identified with that character a lot because he wasn\u2019t perfect. Vic Sage was didn\u2019t do anything right.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nRidley: In the first issue, he gets his arm broken, shot in the head, dropped in the river...and you\u2019re the hero.\n\n\n\nio9: And at the end of 36 issues, he gets airlifted out of the city he was trying to save. Because he just couldn\u2019t do it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRidley: It\u2019s a great, great run.\n\n\n\n...why the Question doesn\u2019t have a film is beyond me. I would do a Question film in a heartbeat.\n\nio9: We don\u2019t think about failure enough in superhero fiction. What does it mean when you don\u2019t win? And I think that would be a great thing to explore in an adaptation. Plus, his visual? A guy with no face? Come on.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRidley: I started out in a noir space when I was writing, and just that look \u2014 that alienation and obsession. He\u2019s obsessed with fixing his city, but he\u2019s alienated from it in every way, shape, and form. It was just a great, great, run. And I think the only unfortunate thing was that it comes out of the same space as Watchmen and Dark Knight. Like now, say you\u2019re doing a great series in the Game of Thrones era, it doesn\u2019t matter what you do, you\u2019ve got this other machine that just sucks all the air out. But it\u2019s one of the truly great series in the history of comic books.\n\nAdapting the Work of a Science Fiction Master\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile we talked, Ridley mentioned Needle in a Timestack, the science fiction movie that he\u2019s working on in its early stages, based on a short story by Robert Silverberg.\n\n\n\nRidley: So, it\u2019s a Robert Silverberg short story\u2014very short story. But, like the best science fiction, it is less about the science and more about the possibilities, and more about the very question of \u201cWhat if time travel\u2014like really good science, the way people are on their iPhones now\u2014is just part of our lives?\u201d And if time travel was really part of our life, it\u2019d still in a space [where] the rich have it, like with private jets. It\u2019s aspirational and you kind of got to put up with it, if you don\u2019t have it. What if?\n\nWhat does love mean? What do relationships mean? What is the timeless nature of love? Is it better to love a lot and know it\u2019s going to be short? Or is it better to fight for a relationship that\u2019s going to go for a long time? But in that fighting, you never get to appreciate your partner and who you\u2019re with. It\u2019s an amazing story. It\u2019s a very beautiful story. It\u2019s one that, frankly, I\u2019ve been chasing for maybe twenty years. I mean really chasing, because I didn\u2019t own the underlying rights, and I finally got the opportunity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf I was going to say something to your readers, perseverance matters. And people say, \u201cWow, it\u2019s really great that you get to do these things.\u201d I\u2019m fortunate because I\u2019ve had a lot of really great people supporting me, but I have to say, more than anything else, just being dogged about the things I believe in, and Needle in a Timestack is one of those things. I can\u2019t wait. We\u2019re putting it together now and I can\u2019t wait to start shooting and bring it to an audience. I also think it\u2019s a little different in that, obviously, I\u2019ve worked with a lot of very politicized pieces. It\u2019s not an accident. I\u2019m very happy for it. But it is nice to look at the different space and work in a film that is going to be colorblind, but race-aware.\n\nWhat we\u2019re trying to put together\u2014to follow up about what we talked about earlier, the \u201cWhy does it have to be like that?\u201d\u2014this is one where it\u2019s just going to be people struggling with something that\u2019s extraordinary, but see those extraordinary struggles about love and life and relationship reflected in more of a world that we live in.\n\nio9: It\u2019s interesting because some of what you\u2019re saying is the same reaction I had to the Wrinkle in Time trailer. \u201cOf course Oprah Winfrey could be a cosmic force in the universe.\u201d She\u2019s a cosmic force in this universe. And you can have these characters \u2014 the \u201cWise Woman Archetype\u201d who don\u2019t have to look like a suburban mom from the 1950s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRidley: We also have people of color who are marginalized into that magical part, or that sidekick part. The great thing about watching that trailer is you go, \u201cThis really looks like the world that we live in.\u201d But rendered in a big, inviting way. So, we want to do the same thing with Needle in a Time Stack. To take very fundamental stories that are often told from the POV of the prevailing culture, and say, \u201cNo, these are relevant stories\u201d for any culture. For any one.\n\nio9: It\u2019s funny. I watched the new Planet of the Apes movie... it reminds [me] of black freedom struggles throughout history. But at the same time, I was heartened, because that\u2019s a universal story. You know? It\u2019s not like we were the first people in slavery, or the first people to fight for civil rights, but it\u2019s a universal story. So I felt it was good to have that response because it reminds me of the work that people all around the world did to become free. It\u2019s now something that people can use to inspire other kinds of stories, and that\u2019s inherently a good thing.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRidley: Well, it\u2019s interesting to me, because, you look at Planet of the Apes and where it really originated, back in the \u201860s, and what it\u2019s about is ultimately\u2014and I want to be very careful, because I\u2019m talking about the ideology of the story, not the iconography of things that are happening in it\u2014but it\u2019s the story of the prevailing culture losing their power. And you have this other group over here saying, \u201cHey, you know what? We just want to live. We just want to go on. But we\u2019re in ascension right now and you need to learn to deal with us. They say peace over and over again, we\u2019ve got a waning culture going, \u2018Well, we can\u2019t accept that. And we\u2019ll fight you to the death.\u2019\n\nI think that is very interesting, because, to me\u2014and by the way Rod Serling co-wrote the film version of the original Planet of the Apes\u2014to me, that\u2019s what it was about. \u201cYou bastards, you changed everything\u201d There are levels there: a different group tearing down these icons that you built up but it was you actually destroyed this stuff; we\u2019re just picking up the pieces. And I think that\u2019s always very, very powerful. I\u2019ve not seen the new film yet. Clearly it is very powerful and well rendered in terms of how people are receiving it. But imagine if that were people of color, and we\u2019ve just taken over, and we\u2019ve got no issue, we\u2019re just living in peace over here. The repsonse would be something like, \u201cYeah, we can\u2019t accept that. So every time we find a gun, we\u2019re going to go at you.\u201d", "keywords": ["youre", "love", "scifi", "making", "john", "going", "superheroes", "live", "lot", "dont", "way", "say", "great", "think", "thats", "ridley", "screenwriter", "world"], "polarity": 0.18875257256404798, "subjectivity": 0.5231227852293425},

After an early childhood of correcting anyone who dared mispronounce it, I spent most of grammar school feeling burdened by a name seemingly so difficult, no one could be bothered to learn to say it right. By the time I reached junior high, I just wanted to fit in with a cute nickname. The clique of \u201cmean girls\u201d who conditionally befriended me at that age were happy to oblige, suggesting I call myself \u201cMisha\u201d because it was \u201ceasier.\u201d\n\n\n\nThey were right. Misha was easier than Maiysha. She was less ethnic, less complicated, less ... unique in the upscale Chicago suburb where I attended school. And it stuck; all through high school in the suburbs of Minneapolis and my elite liberal arts college years in New York, I was Misha.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until after college, while on a date with a brother who asked me point-blank why I hated the name my father had so lovingly chosen from the back of a Miles Davis album, that I began to ask myself. Very soon after, Maiysha took her rightful place in every introduction.\n\nOne of our undisputed #faves, Danai Gurira, had a similar experience in coming to accept\u2014and embrace\u2014her Zimbabwean name. The actress and writer\u2014who\u2019s rocking worlds this week as Dora Milaje general Okoye in Black Panther (and celebrated her 40th birthday on Valentine\u2019s Day)\u2014penned an intimate essay for Glamour magazine\u2019s February issue. In it, she talks about accepting her African name, which she confesses not even knowing she had until she was 5 years old:\n\nBorn in Grinnell, Iowa, to Zimbabwean academic parents, I was given a nickname, Dede, that stuck before I was cognizant enough to have a choice in the matter. Danai was on the register, certificates, trophies. Dede prevailed still. My own endorsement made it so. It sounded close enough to a Western name and made me feel like I fit in, to some extent at least. We were one of only two black families in town, and Mom and Dad already talked differently from everyone else. A strong African name? Too much.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite having African-American parents, I knew that feeling all too well. And like me, Gurira had a \u201ccome to the culture\u201d moment that inspired a major shift in how she self-identified. She shares that transition with Glamour:\n\nI started reading Toni Morrison, Alex Haley, James Baldwin, speeches by Martin Luther King Jr., The Autobiography of Malcolm X. I started to connect the dots around why I was rejecting my people\u2019s cultural markers and the dominating effects of Eurocentric culture. I questioned why I didn\u2019t speak my parents\u2019 native language and began to test how much Shona I knew. I can\u2019t say exactly when it happened, but thank God that it did: I saw that rejecting my own culture, down to the name my parents had given me, was unacceptable. All of a sudden I needed to lay claim to what folks had fought and died for me to have\u2014the freedom to speak my own language, my own name.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat freedom led Gurira to begin to refer to herself as \u201cZimerican,\u201d acknowledging her Zimbabwean and American identities as equal and inextricable from each other. It also led her to truly embrace both the beauty and troubled histories of her home countries, which, she writes, currently \u201csit at defining moments: America faces political division and a crisis of leadership, and Zimbabwe is finding its footing in a transition of power after decades under one man\u2019s rule.\u201d Owning that history was empowering for Gurira, who writes:\n\nI realized my heritage was to be celebrated, not denied. I didn\u2019t want to fit into what I perceived as a more Western, more acceptable mainstream. My middle name, Jekesai, means to \u201cilluminate,\u201d taken from a hymn about praying for a light at the end of a dark tunnel. I was born amid the war for independence in Zimbabwe, and my parents didn\u2019t know whether they\u2019d ever be able to go back. Jekesai was a declaration of their hopes that light would come. I wanted to bring light to those who should be seen more, heard more: people of marginalized cultures.\n\nIlluminating, indeed. In Shona, her parents\u2019 native tongue, Danai means \u201cto be in love\u201d or \u201cto love one another.\u201d The name is perfect for a Valentine\u2019s Day baby, but even more so for a woman who now consciously infuses her identity into everything she creates and chooses to participate in.\n\nI began to ask people to call me Danai. That choice has affected every choice I\u2019ve made since\u2014the stories I tell, the characters I play, the activism I embark upon. It has influenced everything from plays I write (including Eclipsed, about a girl thrown into a rebel war camp in Liberia) to portraying a general of an African king\u2019s army in Black Panther to co-founding the nonprofit Almasi Arts, a Zimbabwean American dramatic arts collaborative.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust when we thought we couldn\u2019t love her more, Danai Gurira keeps stunning us with her beauty, her strength and, now, her transparency.

The proposal is authored by a representative who has long been a vocal defender of the Confederate flag and another Republican lawmaker who said that the victims of the Charleston, S.C., church massacre \u201cwaited to be shot.\u201d There is only one problem with the plan:\n\nSouth Carolina didn\u2019t have any black Confederate soldiers.\n\nOn Dec. 13, state Reps. Bill Chumley (R-Spartanburg) and Mike Burns (R-Greenville) filed a proposed piece of legislation to recognize African Americans who fought for the Confederate States of America in the bloodiest conflict in the nation\u2019s history. The lawmakers are seeking to form a commission that would eventually build a monument dedicated to black Confederate soldiers, according to The State.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut experts say there is no evidence that black soldiers fought alongside Southern whites in the War Between the States. \u201cIn all my years of research, I can say I have seen no documentation of black South Carolina soldiers fighting for the Confederacy,\u201d said historian Walter Edgar, author of South Carolina: A History. Edgar also served for 32 years as director of the University of South Carolina\u2019s Institute for Southern Studies. \u201cIn fact, when secession came, the state turned down free [blacks] who wanted to volunteer because they didn\u2019t want armed persons of color,\u201d Edgar added.\n\nThe South Carolina Department of Archives and History has no records of black soldiers receiving combat pay during the Confederacy, according to The State. Documents show that blacks served as cooks, buglers and body servants, but not as combat soldiers. Confederate law banned blacks from owning firearms until 1865, the very end of the Civil War, when blacks fought in states like Virginia and Texas but not South Carolina. South Carolina\u2019s laws even prohibited mixed-race citizens from serving in combat duty and showed a complete rejection of any nonwhite armed participation in the Confederacy\u2019s cause.\n\nChumley and Burns basically responded to those facts with a Caucasian version of, \u201cYeah, but still ... \u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see that\u2019s a problem,\u201d said Chumley, when asked about the lack of evidence. \u201cIf they served in the Confederate Army, they deserve to be recognized.\u201d The politicians also filed a companion bill that would form a commission to construct a plan to teach the state\u2019s public school students about African Americans\u2019 participation in the Civil War.\n\nBoth lawmakers voted against the removal of the symbol of white supremacy from the Statehouse following Dylann Roof\u2019s 2015 mass murder at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston. Burns famously wrote an op-ed dripping with white supremacist tears for USA Today on why removing the Confederate flag was a mistake. And during the debate on the flag removal, Chumley said that the nine victims \u201cwaited their turn to be shot.\u201d\n\nI have come up with a solution to the controversy that should make everyone happy. If South Carolina wants to build a monument to people who never existed, just make the monument invisible, too. In fact, I\u2019ve already built it. Maybe you can\u2019t see it, but trust me\u2014just like the black soldiers of the Confederacy\u2014it\u2019s there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSee?

Tom Crittenden, the church\u2019s rector, told the Times-Dispatch. \u201cBut Charlottesville seems to have moved us to this point. Not that we have a different view of Lee historically in our church, but we have appreciation for our need to move on.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPeople have left the church,\u201d vestry member Doug Cumming added. \u201cPeople have felt exhausted by it.

Black power had faded, to be replaced by Afro Sheen. This was the period when Stevie Wonder, Aretha Franklin, Marvin Gaye, Isaac Hayes, and Earth, Wind & Fire were pushing the boundaries of spirit, social reality and sound; when black folks had briefly tried out the term \u201cAfro-American\u201d (presumably a historical echo of Malcolm X\u2019s suggestion?) and everybody was, indeed, kung fu fighting.\n\nMuhammad Ali was already a superhero in the black community, long before DC Comics thought up the crazy idea of pairing him with Supes. I remember watching his fights, post-mortem, on the ABC Wide World of Sports broadcasts. (They aired on network television sometimes live, but sometimes after the fact because cable television was still a technology being tested. Often, the only way you could see a live Ali fight in the rabbit-ears, five-channel era and not be in the arena was via something called \u201cclosed-circuit television,\u201d where you would have to go a theater and pay to see the broadcast via satellite. Closed-circuit television was the analog to pay-per-view.) These weekend ABC network broadcasts, sometimes narrated by Ali and ABC sportscaster Howard Cosell, were how those of us in Any Ghetto, U.S.A., got to see many Ali fights for free.\n\nMeanwhile (a favorite transition word in superhero land), I loved comics, then and now. In 1978 Mom bought me this huge 10-by-14-inch comic (known as a \u201cTreasury edition\u201d) called Superman vs. Muhammad Ali. It was a massive 78 pages, and thanks to the top-talent team-up of penciler Neal Adams and inker Dick Giordano, it had the greatest artwork I had ever seen. (Dennis O\u2019Neil, the writer responsible for making Batman cool after the 1960s television series, worked on the story with Adams.)\n\nFor a moment\u2014just one\u2014I put aside the greatness of Marvel Comics\u2019 creators Stan Lee, Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko and devoured the story. Plot: an green alien race\u2014called the Scrubb, believe it or not!\u2014challenged Earth\u2019s mightiest warrior, Ali, to a fight, or its space armada would destroy the Earth! Superman intervenes, saying that he should fight the alien instead. When Ali balks at this, the Scrubb demand that the two duke it out (under a red sun that neutralizes Superman\u2019s powers) as a preliminary match to the main event.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAli trains Superman at the Fortress of Solitude and then, in a massive arena packed with beings from different galaxies (and a universewide television audience), kicks the Man of Steel\u2019s white, red and blue ass! Then the champ takes on the alien, who looks like a cross between, well, the Hulk and Hulk Hogan, and wins! Super black power, baby! Power to the people! The Earth was saved by the Greatest in the universe, in fact and fiction!\n\nBy 1978, the conflict between Ali and Malcolm X\u2014the latter then a black-counterculture dangerous radical, not the human rights martyr/American postage stamp he\u2019s viewed as now\u2014had faded in the African-American mind. America was now in 2-D: desegregation and disco. And Ali, whom white America had considered a dangerous, unpatriotic \u201cBlack Muslim\u201d (Nation of Islam) racist just a decade ago, had publicly proved himself on many levels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe United States had stripped Ali of his world heavyweight boxing title and tried to put him in jail because of his conscientious objection to the Vietnam War. But \u201cthe People\u2019s Champion\u201d fought back and won. Ali had beaten George Foreman in Zaire in 1974, regaining his heavyweight championship title against all odds. America respects character, perseverance and, above all else, the ability to win. Black comic book historian Adilifu Nama writes that the superhero comic was an important marker in the ongoing image makeover that Ali, now an orthodox Muslim, was undergoing with the American public. As he stood side by side with Superman, Ali\u2019s attitude, name and religion had officially been accepted.\n\nThe irony of this comic book is that when it came out, Ali had just lost the heavyweight title (a point that Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man, by the way, did not fail to point out). Out of nowhere, some nobody from the Olympics named Leon Spinks had beaten him and become the champion! So a tired, aging Ali had to come back, and did. Three times a champion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Ali-Superman wraparound cover has its own history. The audience is packed with 1970s celebrities and DC\u2019s superhero comic book characters, from Lucille Ball to Michael Jackson and his brothers to Lex Luthor and Batman. (The inside cover even had a code so you could see who was there.) Adams did an homage cover for ESPN: The Magazine with Ali vs. Michael Jordan, for Athlete of the Century, in 2000.\n\nThis hokey story is considered by comic book geeks of a certain age either one of the worst or one of the best\u2014or both?\u2014comics made in the 20th century. But either way, it was a unique treasure and is forever, like its hero.\n\nTodd Steven Burroughs, an independent researcher and writer based in Newark, N.J., is the author of Son-Shine on Cracked Sidewalks, an audiobook on Amiri Baraka and Ras Baraka through the eyes of the 2014 Newark mayoral campaign.

Some of the infamous beads thrown into the crowds reflected the image of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee to protest the removal of his statue from New Orleans\u2019 most prominent traffic circle, which has been a symbolic focal point of parade routes\u2014hence the bead\u2019s name, \u201cForever Lee Circle.\u201d\n\n\n\nThere were also Confederate-flag beads, T-shirts and an old image of the statue clandestinely projected on to City Hall. The Lee monument was removed by Mayor Mitch Landrieu on May 19, 2017, after steady pressure from the #TakeEmDownNOLA movement.\n\n\n\nInitially, the bead controversy mostly played out on local blogs and social media, but concerns over racism at Mardi Gras intensified this week after blackface figurines began popping up. In a statement to the Southern Poverty Law Center, \u201cForever Lee Circle\u201d creator \u201cMikas Eaux\u201d insisted that \u201cthe beads serve as a conduit to take the stigma out of Southern history.\u201d\n\nAllies like Save Nola Heritage publicized the trinket as a fun, celebratory way to preserve history, deploying the hashtag #ThrowWhatchaWanna to equate the beads with free speech. But as progressives pointed out, the hashtag ironically evoked the upbeat, brassy jazz anthem \u201cDo Whatcha Wanna,\u201d by Rebirth Brass Band, which is composed entirely of Afro-Creole and African-American musical elements.\n\nThis bitter exchange may seem out of place for an event known for apolitical merrymaking, but the collision of race and revelry is actually in keeping with Mardi Gras\u2019 long racial history. It\u2019s not the first time that white supremacists have used the parade in service of their goals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, the parading tradition itself grows right out of white anxiety over mixing and mingling between free and enslaved, black and white, rich and immigrant.\n\nBefore the 1850s, the New Orleanian celebration was more akin to the Carnevale of Venice, with its egalitarian street-level revelry and festivities. Contemporaneous newspapers and travelers reported sensationalized violence and sexual depravity of new immigrant populations, especially the Irish (who had not yet become white), and the alleged intimacy between white \u201cladies\u201d and masked black men occurring during Carnival.\n\nAfter the Louisiana Purchase, the growing English-speaking, Protestant population attempted to curtail the Carnival tradition celebrated by the Catholic Creoles. Early attempts failed, but by 1856, a tentative alliance between white Americans and white Creoles of the city\u2019s slaveholding and professional classes established the Mistick Krewe of Comus and transformed Carnival into the form we know today, a preapproved parade route followed in a neat, linear fashion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1857 the Comus Krewe introduced the tableaux vivant, or living picture, to Mardi Gras, which featured members of the secret society in elaborate costumes and posed upon lavishly decorated floats. The original floats presented allegories from classic mythology and literature, such as Milton\u2019s Paradise Lost. Members were explicit about their motives\u2014in order to salvage Mardi Gras from what they saw as cultural degeneration, they presented the best of Anglophone culture and art and literally raised the city\u2019s elite white men to aspirational levels above the crowd.\n\nDuring Reconstruction, New Orleans\u2019 white elites used the pomp and ceremony of Mardi Gras to reassert symbolic and political control after the Confederacy\u2019s defeat. The Louisiana Constitution of 1868 ushered in desegregated schools and public transportation, recognized the citizenship of African Americans, and granted the right to vote and hold office to African-American men without property requirements. Local white men perceived this new racial equality as a threat and were eager to recapture their former power.\n\nCarnival krewes took their political arguments to the streets and manipulated their festive displays to provide evidence of the illegitimacy and incongruity of black citizenship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Crescent City Democratic Club, later renamed the Crescent City White League, whose stated goal was to prevent the \u201cAfricanization\u201d of New Orleans and Louisiana, formed the city\u2019s second krewe in 1870. The Twelfth Night Revelers regularly caricatured African-American lawmakers as bumbling crows or backward strongmen.\n\nComus presented its infamous \u201cthe Missing Links to Darwin\u2019s Origin of Species\u201d and \u201cthe Aryan Race\u201d themes in 1873 and 1877, respectively. The former theme culminated with an anthropomorphic crowned gorilla standing in contrast against a white Comus, suggesting the innate inferiority of black men holding civic office. In like fashion, the Knights of Momus displayed comical yet grotesque representations of mixed-race people among equally grotesque animal hybrids in its 1873 parade themed \u201cthe Coming Races.\u201d\n\nMardi Gras had become a mode by which former slaveholders and Confederate sympathizers could maintain symbolic power and communicate ideas of white supremacy, social Darwinism and the \u201cLost Cause\u201d even under the city\u2019s interracial Republican government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOver the last century, African Americans, women and LGBTQ people have all established parading organizations that have at times directly and indirectly challenged the elite white male control of Mardi Gras.\n\nIn recent years, there has been searing political satire of the response to Hurricane Katrina and the 2016 election. This progress, however, only further demonstrates how the revelry and debauchery of Carnival does not have an inherent political bent. Carnival is a fluid, flexible form and, thus, allows for both progressive and prejudiced values to flourish. This year, my social media newsfeed was filled with posts bemoaning the Knights of Chaos\u2019 floats lampooning Colin Kaepernick, kneeling NFL players and Dreamers.\n\nIn the end, sometimes racism looks like swastikas and tiki torches, but sometimes it looks like a parade.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrederick Staidum Jr., Ph.D., is a scholar of 19th-century American culture and literature at Loyola University Chicago and a Public Voices Fellow with the Op-Ed Project.

Earlier that night, the Memphis City Council had voted unanimously to take down the monument.\n\nBut the city of Memphis wasn\u2019t done. By 10:40 p.m., a smaller statue of Confederate President Jefferson Davis had also been removed from another park in the city.\n\nTami Sawyer, one of the leaders of Take \u2019Em Down 901, a group that had actively petitioned to remove the statues, told the Times that to \u201cfinally get to this moment is overwhelming.\u201d\n\n\u201cI looked Nathan Bedford in the eyes and shed a tear for my ancestors,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nU.S. Rep.

The sale of the two park properties, Health Sciences Park (the site of the Forrest statue, and which had previously been called Forrest Park) and Memphis Park, was approved by the council at a price of $1,000 apiece, according to WREG-TV.\n\nNext, the City Council voted to remove the two Confederate statues from the parks\u2014a measure that passed unanimously.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs WREG-TV reports, \u201cwithin minutes of the decision\u201d a crane rolled into Health Science Park, which was flanked by \u201ca heavy police presence.\u201d\n\nNot everyone was happy with the decision, of course. According to Time, the Sons of Confederate Veterans in Memphis claims that the statues do not represent white supremacy\u2014despite that being the very basis of the Confederate States of America\u2014and said it would be a mistake to remove them.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what will happen with Forrest\u2019s remains, which, Time reports, are buried under the monument.", "keywords": ["tenn", "confederate", "council", "memphis", "dark", "statue", "reports", "statues", "city", "come", "night", "remove", "times", "park"], "polarity": 0.10168109668109668, "subjectivity": 0.4387518037518037},

Because Robert Lee, an Asian announcer for ESPN, happens to share the same name as the Confederate Gen. Robert E.

The news station adds that the move was a sensitive one not just because of the recent violence that erupted in Charlottesville, Va., but because Lee just got a promotion and didn\u2019t want to cause any waves.\n\nWhile I understand that ESPN is trying to be sensitive to those offended by statues of the Confederate general and by the white nationalist rally of pale-faced white men wearing angry scowls and carrying tiki torches, this feels like a stretch at best. But before you start in with your ESPN jokes, keep in mind that the network was trying not only to be sensitive to viewers who might\u2019ve been offended; it also didn\u2019t want Lee to become a punchline to crude social media jokesters. Both efforts seem genuine, I guess.\n\nThe news that Lee had been switched because of his name started to trickle out late Tuesday.

The occasion was the annual Black Comic Book Festival\u2014an event that draws thousands of comic enthusiasts, creators, publishers and collectors. Black Panther tickets had just gone on sale days before, and an evening event at the festival promised advanced clips from the film. But the Marvel film was, in many ways, old news to some of the attendees.\n\nThey were there to commune with one another, promote their stories, explore new stories and revel in a space that was wholly theirs.\n\nLining the halls were comic book heads of all levels\u2014the devout, with decades of reading under their belt; others who were in their nascency; and kids curious about the characters in costumes lining the vendor tables. At a Black Characters Matter panel, Stacey Robinson, an artist and Arthur Schomburg fellow, spoke in the Langston Hughes Auditorium about his art. How, through it, he transforms the gallery spaces containing his pieces\u2014areas that have long excluded black people as creators and audience\u2014into spaces where black liberation was foregrounded, if only temporarily.\n\n\n\nRobinson spoke to the audience about the need to \u201cdefine our blackness instead of responding to our colonial situation.\u201d By putting work centering black life in historically white spaces, Robinson said that he aimed to \u201ctransform the original concept of that space.\u201d\n\nJust days before, Black Panther broke yet another barrier: The film had smashed the presale records for the Marvel Comics Universe, the most lucrative film franchise of all time.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nListening to Robinson, it was hard not to consider the anticipation for Black Panther against what American theaters have historically been: segregated spaces largely unconcerned with depicting black life. Now, in the days leading up to Black Panther\u2019s official release, the biggest story in cinema right now is about a black utopian space\u2014Wakanda.\n\n\n\nBack in January, the early numbers assigned a quantitative value to the anticipation many had felt for months. During a news cycle that felt frequently dystopic, the pull of a true black utopian space, whether it be the fictional Wakanda or the community of enthralled movie theatergoers immersing themselves in it, was real.\n\nBlack Panther offers up a singular hero and what may be the strongest case to date (though far from the first) for racial parity in Hollywood. But just as important as the film\u2019s titular main character is its setting\u2014an African country that has never been colonized or pillaged. A place that kept its dearest and most valuable resources secret in order to protect them, and to develop as a sovereign state on its own terms.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs i09 writer and co-author of The Rise of the Black Panther, Evan Narcisse, told the Washington Post, \u201cWakanda represents this unbroken chain of achievement of black excellence that never got broken by colonialism.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that Wakanda isn\u2019t a utopia for its lack of conflict\u2014there would certainly be no movie without it\u2014but because of the break it offers from the dystopic narrative that is the literal history of many native peoples around the world: one where colonization, subjugation and, in some places, extermination have been the story.\n\n\ufeff\u201cI always wanted to play a normal person. For me, my goal was to maybe be the best friend.\u201d \u2014Florence Kasumba, actress, \u2018Black Panther\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWakanda also presents a welcome break from an American cinematic tradition that has either ignored the lives of black people or focused heavy-handedly on black trauma and victimhood.\n\nThe net result is a flat cinematic rendering of black humanity, where black people are viewed primarily as survivors of racial trauma and violence. The secondary effect is that many of these films\u20142017\u2019s Detroit is a prime example\u2014often feel like primers for white audiences about the evils of racism than compassionate and complex imaginings of black people as living beings.\n\nThis singular presentation has limited the ways that black audiences could view themselves, stymied filmmakers eager to tell alternative narratives and restricted actors looking to bring more nuanced, truthful characters to the screen. Actress Florence Kasumba, who plays a member of Wakanda\u2019s all-woman royal guard, the Dora Milaje, can speak to that void.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen I grew up, I wanted to have these role models and I wanted to see maybe people that looked like me where I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh my gosh, I could do that, too!\u2019 But I didn\u2019t have that,\u201d Kasumba told The Root. \u201cAll of a sudden there\u2019s this movie that\u2019s coming out and you\u2019ve already seen all these different people. And we represent all these different countries or tribes.\u201d\n\nThe Ugandan-born German actress, despite having just one line in Captain America: Civil War, was memorable in that film, as much for the quiet force of her presence as her striking looks. Kasumba is dark-skinned, with Grace Jones-high cheekbones and hair that she keeps cut short even when she\u2019s not playing a member of the Wakandan royal guard. Her looks could easily be described by \u201cmainstream\u201d (that is, white) audiences as \u201cexotic\u201d\u2014a label that always raises the question, \u201cExotic to whom?\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose labels typically keep actors like Kasumba from playing the sort of characters that most resemble their experiences.\n\n\u201cI always wanted to play a normal person. For me, my goal was to maybe be the best friend,\u201d Kasumba said, adding that the roles she had played before, of refugees and prostitutes, felt very different from her reality.\n\n\n\nWhile those stories are necessary to tell, Wakanda\u2019s is noteworthy because it isn\u2019t a world of compounded trauma; it\u2019s one of self-determination and sovereignty. And for Kasumba, the world of Wakanda on set provided the sort of sisterhood, and normalization, that was missing on other films.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI always loved the atmosphere. It was very inspirational,\u201d she said of working with the other Dora. Not only did the actresses who played the Wakandan royal guards represent the diversity of the African Diaspora, but they all had extensive martial arts training and, Kasumba says, frequently assisted one another with fight moves on set.\n\n\u201cI would see my colleagues\u2014I would look at their hair, when they still had hair, or the way they would dress themselves, and there were all these things where I just thought\u2014\u2018I\u2019m not used to that,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\n\n\n\u201cUsually people always say [to me], \u2018Oh wow. You look different.\u2019 Or, \u2018Your style ... ,\u2019 and I don\u2019t find my style so special,\u201d Kasumba added. \u201cBut there I was around all these different people that were all very confident and very at peace with themselves.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Kasumba, working on Black Panther was that chance to blend in\u2014to just feel normal. She never thought she would get that from a superhero film.\n\n\n\n\u201cI thought it was just guys fighting. That\u2019s not the case,\u201d she said. \u201c[My family and I] can\u2019t buy tickets yet in Germany, but I will go out and buy these tickets. Although I was in the movie I\u2019m still thinking, \u2018No, I want to support it because I want people to see it.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI have to see it probably a hundred times. You know that\u2019s going to be very expensive,\u201d Kasumba said, tilting her head back in laughter.\n\nIn Captain America: Civil War, Kasumba delivered just one line. \u201cMove,\u201d she told Scarlett Johansson\u2019s Black Widow, \u201cor be moved.\u201d It\u2019s a line that, nearly two years later, stands in for the arrival of Wakanda into the cinematic imagination.\n\nBlack Panther director Ryan Coogler is certainly not the first to visualize and create a black utopian space on film. But the difference here is one of scale and magnitude: Never before will so many eyes around the world, at the same time, thanks to a singular movie, confront, revel in and contemplate the possibility of black utopia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis massive collective experience can also give audiences a new shared vocabulary, both visual and verbal, with which to have conversations about blackness, as artist Stacey Robinson says. Last year, for examples, filmgoers used the shorthand of \u201cthe sunken place\u201d from Get Out to discuss the white allegiance and subservience some black people and people of color experience.\n\n\u201cThe beautiful thing about Wakanda, and the way I think about it even in my work as an artist, is I look at these free black spaces as spaces to jump-start conversations about blackness,\u201d said Robinson. \u201cThe way I think about black utopian spaces in my speculative work is we get out of colonialism to begin the conversation about who we are. Outside of colonialism, we can be all things that we want to be. Wakanda is a visualization of that.\u201d\n\n\u201c[Wakanda] can actually be the template for what is actually here. What is factual.\u201d\ufeff \u2014Stacey Robinson, artist\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRobinson adds that Wakanda, beyond offering a welcome tonic to a dystopian news cycle, beyond serving as a guide with which to imagine the future, \u201ccan actually be the template for what is actually here. What is factual.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe points out the technologies that black people have created in spite of years of abuse and exploitation. Superheroes like T\u2019Challa are aspirational, but the utopia of Wakanda may give us a way of thinking about and experiencing blackness in the present, Robinson says.\n\n\n\n\u201cWho else on the planet has taken the type of abuse that we\u2019ve taken for hundreds of years, and not only have we survived it, but we\u2019ve created some of the best technologies that the world has seen from the last few hundred years?\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s taking the guts of pigs and creating a delicacy that white people sell to other white people for high dollars. We\u2019ve taken the chitlins, our survival mechanism, and we turned it into a technology for our survival that now is something that\u2019s even gentrified,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cEven the guts that they gave us. We are an amazing people.\u201d\n\n\n\nLast year the images of Themyscira, Wonder Woman\u2019s homeland, enthralled audiences around the world with its glimpse at a lush, women-only utopia (albeit one dominated, it seems, by white women). It hinted at a very specific freedom, away from the war and turmoil of men.\ufeff\n\nWakanda will likely have similar resonance. Wakanda is an unmistakably black utopia, but the fundamental fact of worldwide colonization\u2014one that afflicted the Americas and Asia as well as Africa\u2014gives the mythical African nation enduring symbolism. The questions Wakanda raises, and the success the Black Panther film carves out from this place of origin, are sure to sit with audiences and artists for a long time:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWho could we be if the most precious, valuable and beautiful parts of ourselves were left untouched, unpillaged and unspoiled?\n\nWhat would \u201cnormal\u201d have been?

The latest targets of federal immigration audits are businesses in the Los Angeles area.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times reports that after a five-day operation that ended Thursday, ICE issued audit notices to more than 120 businesses.\n\nThe audits are said to have dual purposes: ICE wants to punish employers and employees who are breaking immigration rules, as well as discourage others from entering the country unlawfully.\n\nICE spokeswoman Dani Bennett told the Times: \u201cIt\u2019s a deterrent to somebody who is thinking about crossing the border, paying a smuggler and taking that perilous journey.

People of all ages, races, gender expressions and backgrounds followed the buoyant brass band horns and booty-shaking drumbeats of the second-line parade honoring the Purple One. We clapped, shouted and sang to the heavens.\n\nThere was no place I would rather have been to celebrate and mourn our collective beloved, Prince.\n\nThe Trem\u00e9 is a birthplace to numerous aspects of American musical culture, specifically because of the African Diaspora and African-American contributions. The 1700s and 1800s Congo Square, located in this neighborhood, was where African slaves could gather on Sundays to dance, play music and sell goods. It was a place of resistance, freedom and holiness as they honored their traditional African spirituality, veiled under more \u201cacceptable\u201d Catholic practices. From these roots, jazz was born, and the city\u2019s black culture has influenced every musical genre since. New Orleans is a city that can\u2019t be separated from music.\n\nPrince and his music are a direct result of this lineage. All four of his grandparents were from Louisiana; his mother was a jazz singer, and his dad was a pianist and songwriter. He grew up surrounded by music, and his father encouraged his creativity. Music was in his blood, along with this spirit of defiance against conformity. It is evident in his unmatched musicianship dominating the guitar and drums, among other instruments. We saw it clearly in his lyrical content, style of dress (or undress) and ostentatious stage shows.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Crescent City is also known for its partying. The city\u2019s motto is \u201cLaissez les bons temps rouler\u201d (\u201cLet the good times roll\u201d), and you\u2019ll see that written pretty much everywhere. But Mardi Gras culture is more than beads, breasts and daiquiris to go. Beyond Bourbon Street, in black neighborhoods, the celebration reflects the history and culture of the city. Mardi Gras Indians with brightly colored, ornately feathered and beaded suits embody the ties between African slaves and Native Americans. You\u2019ll see numerous \u201csocial aid and pleasure clubs\u201d participating, organizations that were set up by black communities in the Jim Crow era to take care of one another. There are spectacular organized parades\u2014and then there are more-impromptu second lines.\n\nThis merging of music and celebration comes alive through the tradition of the second line, brass band street celebrations that descended from jazz funerals. There I stood amid the official Prince second line, only four days after he passed, feeling raw like so many others around me. I quickly ended up next to a couple of \u201cBaby Dolls,\u201d members of a group started by African-American sex workers in 1912.\n\nVanessa, a petite, fiery woman perhaps in her 50s, was working her purple satin baby-doll dress with white ruffles and waving her white parasol. You could not stand still around her; she was life-giving because of her infectious energy. She was joined by another woman sporting a purple sequined fedora who is the daughter of legendary Baby Doll \u201cQueen Mercy.\u201d Together they danced on their friends\u2019 stoops, chanting \u201cPurple Rain,\u201d and danced with passersby before they tag-team humped a motorcycle with the policeman still sitting on it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Baby Dolls formed in black Storyville, the segregated red-light district. According to Kim Vaz, historian and author of The \u201cBaby Dolls\u201d: Breaking the Race and Gender Barriers of the New Orleans Mardi Gras Tradition, when the African-American women who worked in the area heard that their white counterparts\u2014and competitors\u2014were dressing up for Mardi Gras, they wanted to show out, too. They decided to dress in short skirts and bonnets like little girls to make fun of imposed gender constructs.\n\nJust by \u201cmasking,\u201d they were challenging women\u2019s roles at the time; beyond being sex workers, it was taboo and dangerous for them. But to really cause a stir, they adopted other stereotypical male behaviors like \u201csmoking cigars and flinging money at the men\u201d to assert their independence. The early Baby Dolls sang songs criticizing the men who judged them. It wasn\u2019t just about being rowdy in the streets\u2014they were rebelling against the racial and gender discrimination that greatly affected their lives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs I watched Vanessa and her dance partner in crime, I realized that Prince and the Baby Dolls came from the same spirit of free sexual expression that is particularly taboo for black people in America. Both used overt sexuality to disrupt and challenge gender norms. They made people uncomfortable by using sex to approach social issues. African Americans have always been hypersexualized but not allowed to be autonomous sexual beings. Both the Purple One and the Baby Dolls smashed that paradigm and gave zero f\u2014ks about rules and respectability. Sex was on their terms, and their gender fluidity was on full display. They paved the way for burlesque dancers like me to use nudity for social commentary. Just like the Baby Dolls, Prince gave folks permission to be sensual, bawdy and entrepreneurial.\n\nI eventually lost the Baby Dolls in the crowd as I stood back in awe taking iPhone videos and enjoying a woman with a bike-and-boom-box contraption blasting Prince jams like \u201cI Would Die 4 U,\u201d \u201cDarling Nikki\u201d and \u201c1999.\u201d She\u2019d stop every once in a while, and a crowd would gather to sing along or grind.\n\nAs the party moved, we passed a column holding up Interstate 10 with \u201cBig Up the Black Woman\u201d spray-painted on it. Around the corner, an adorable young man in a G-string and devil horns twerked for partygoers using a gold-painted wooden cross to keep his balance as he bent over. Women slipped dollars into his sweaty black panties. This is Prince\u2019s legacy, only one level of a multifaceted musical genius. He is a son of New Orleans, and he brought this city\u2019s raucous, seductive and subversive cultural spirit to the world. It is now our time to carry on his Purple legacy \u201c4ever\u201d in our hearts and under our skirts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJanna A.

But they deserve to be honored for what they did on behalf of South Carolina.\u201d\ufeff\n\n\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time a Southern state has provoked controversy by promoting the existence of black Confederates. Back in 2010, Virginia was called to revise a fourth-grade textbook that claimed thousands of black soldiers had fought under Stonewall Jackson.\n\nYes, black Confederate soldiers did exist, as this 2015 article from The Root details. Frederick Douglass even wrote of them in 1861 at the Battle of First Manassas, even though black men were officially barred from enlisting for the Confederate Army until the final months of the Civil War in 1865.\n\nBut as the writer, African-American-studies professor John Stauffer, pointed out in his explainer for The Root, there were a handful of Jews who supported the Nazis, as well. One simply cannot tell the history of black Confederates\u2014most of whom were enslaved and forced to labor or to perform menial duties for their masters on the battlefield\u2014without talking about the coercion. \u201cConfederates impressed slaves as laborers and at times forced them to fight. In effect, they put guns to their heads, forcing them to fire on Yankees,\u201d Stauffer wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMemorializing black Confederate soldiers with a monument does more than acknowledge their existence\u2014a history book can do that\u2014but as Civil War historian Kevin Levin told Newsweek, the focus on black Confederates has always been \u201cpart of a larger attempt to reinterpret the Confederacy to separate it from slavery and white supremacy.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIn other words, if African Americans, free and enslaved, fought as soldiers in the Civil War,\u201d Levin continued, \u201cthen you can\u2019t say today that its primary goal was the protection of slavery and white supremacy.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s clear, just a few days after a second white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., around a Robert E.

Lee, Albert Sidney Johnston, John Reagan and James Stephen Hogg from the university\u2019s Main Mall, citing last week\u2019s horrific violence at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va.\n\nLee and Johnston were both Confederate generals, while Reagan was the postmaster general of the Confederacy. Hogg served as governor of Texas from 1891 to 1895 and was the son of a Confederate general.\n\nFenves wrote in his statement regarding the statues\u2019 removal:\n\nThe University of Texas at Austin is a public educational and research institution, first and foremost. The historical and cultural significance of the Confederate statues on our campus\u2014and the connections that individuals have with them\u2014are severely compromised by what they symbolize. Erected during the period of Jim Crow laws and segregation, the statues represent the subjugation of African Americans. That remains true today for white supremacists who use them to symbolize hatred and bigotry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFenves noted that the statues of Lee, Johnston and Reagan will be added to the collection of the school\u2019s Briscoe Center for scholarly study, while the statue of Hogg will be considered for reinstallation at another campus site.\n\n\u201cThe University of Texas at Austin has a duty to preserve and study history.

P.G.T. Beauregard and a statue of Robert E. Lee\u2014would have been stored in an undisclosed location.\n\nThe removal of the monuments in the wake of a 2015 City Council vote to censor the images was not without contention and was met with protests.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNonetheless, down they came, and now Nail wants them. In his letter to Landrieu he wrote: \u201cWe have located in our city a Veterans Memorial Park that honors all Veterans and all struggles. We would put these monuments on display there. They would be safely protected and enjoyed by all people who visit the park.We would truly consider it an honor and a blessing for you to kindly make allowance for our humble request.\u201d\n\n\u201cI sent the letter to see what they might do,\u201d he told the Times. \u201cI don\u2019t know if they\u2019re going to sell them, give them away or something else. Honestly, we\u2019re a small town, and if they end up selling them off for a lot of money, of course we couldn\u2019t do that. If they do give them away, then I would approach the [Hanceville] City Council to see how they want to proceed.\u201d\n\nOf course, Nail is of the school that says it\u2019s about \u201cheritage,\u201d not \u201chate.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I told the mayor, and what I\u2019ve told everyone I\u2019ve talked about it with, is that for me, remembering these people and these events is about heritage\u2014not hate,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsk certain folks to talk about slavery, though, or police brutality and they froth at the mouth. So I guess only some events and people should be remembered.\n\nAnyway, Nail went on to say: \u201cAnybody who knows me knows that I\u2019m no racist. But ultimately, it will be up to the folks in New Orleans\u2014and up to the people who live in Hanceville, and the Hanceville City Council\u2014to decide what\u2014if anything\u2014happens next.\n\n\u201cMy view is that it\u2019s an opportunity, a great teaching tool that we could have in our city,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for all of us to reflect on all our struggles, and to celebrate how far we\u2019ve come\u2014while clearly acknowledging that we had those struggles.

It is a history, our history, that holds in its heart the stories of Native Americans \u2014the Choctaw, Houma Nation, the Chitimacha, Hernando De Soto, Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, the Acadians, the Islenos, the enslaved people from Senegambia, Free People of Colorix [sic], the Haitians, the Germans, both the empires of France and Spain. The Italians, the Irish, the Cubans, the South and Central Americans, the Vietnamese and so many more.\n\nYou see, New Orleans is truly a city of many nations, a melting pot, a bubbling caldron of many cultures. There is no other place quite like it in the world that so eloquently exemplifies the uniquely American motto: e pluribus unum\u2014out of many we are one. But there are also other truths about our city that we must confront.\n\nNew Orleans was one of America\u2019s largest slave market[s], a port where hundreds of thousands of souls were bought, sold and shipped up the Mississippi River to lives of forced labor, of misery, of rape, and of torture. America was a place where nearly 4,000 of our fellow American citizens were lynched, 540 in Louisiana alone; where our courts enshrined \u2018separate but equal\u2019; where Freedom riders were beaten to a bloody pulp. So when people say to me that the monuments in question are history, well, what I just described to you is our history as well, and it is the searing truth.\n\nAnd it immediately begs the questions, why there are no slave ship monuments, no prominent markers on public land to remember the lynchings or the slave blocks; nothing to remember this long chapter of our lives of pain, of sacrifice, of shame, all of it happening on the soil of New Orleans. So for those self-appointed defenders of history and the monuments, they are eerily silent on what amounts to this historical malfeasance, a lie by omission. There is a difference, you see, between remembrance of history and reverence of it.\n\nFor America and New Orleans, it has been a long, winding road, marked by great tragedy and great triumph. But we cannot be afraid of the truth. As President George W. Bush said at the dedication ceremony for the National Museum of African American History and Culture, \u201cA great nation does not hide its history. It faces its flaws and it corrects them.\u201d So today, I want to speak about why we chose to remove these four monuments to the Lost Cause of the Confederacy, but also how and why this process can move us towards healing and understanding each other.\n\nSo, let\u2019s start with the facts.\n\nThe historic record is clear, Robert E. Lee, [Jefferson] Davis, and P.G.T. Beauregard statues were not erected just to honor these men, but as part of the movement which became known as \u201cThe Cult of the Lost Cause.\u201d This cult had one goal\u2014through monuments and through other means\u2014to rewrite history to hide the truth, which is that the Confederacy was on the wrong side of humanity.\n\nFirst erected over 166 years after the founding of our city and 19 years after the end of the Civil War, the monuments that we took down were meant to rebrand the history of our city and the ideals of a defeated Confederacy. It is self-evident that these men did not fight for the United States of America; they fought against it. They may have been warriors, but in this cause they were not patriots. These statues are not just stone and metal. They are not just innocent remembrances of a benign history. These monuments purposefully celebrate a fictional, sanitized Confederacy; ignoring the death, ignoring the enslavement, ignoring the terror that it actually stood for.\n\nAnd after the Civil War, these statues were a part of that terrorism as much as a burning cross on someone\u2019s lawn; they were erected purposefully to send a strong message to all who walked in their shadows about who was still in charge in this city.\n\nA piece of stone\u2014one stone. Both stories were history. One story told. One story forgotten or maybe even purposefully ignored. As clear as it is for me today ... for a long time, even though I grew up in one of New Orleans\u2019 most diverse neighborhoods, even with my family\u2019s long proud history of fighting for civil rights ... I must have passed by those monuments a million times without giving them a second thought. So I am not judging anybody, I am not judging people. We all take our own journey on race.\n\nI just hope people listen like I did when my dear friend Wynton Marsalis helped me see the truth. He asked me to think about all the people who have left New Orleans because of our exclusionary attitudes. Another friend asked me to consider these four monuments from the perspective of an African-American mother or father trying to explain to their fifth-grade daughter why Robert E. Lee sat atop of our city.\n\nCan you do it? Can you do it? Can you look into the eyes of this young girl and convince her that Robert E. Lee is there to encourage her? Do you think she will feel inspired and hopeful by that story? Do these monuments help her see a future with limitless potential? Have you ever thought that if her potential is limited, yours and mine are too? We all know the answer to these very simple questions. When you look into this child\u2019s eyes is the moment when the searing truth comes into focus. This is the moment when we know what we must do\u2014when we know what is right. We can\u2019t walk away from this truth.\n\nNow I knew that taking down the monuments was going to be tough, but you elected me to do the right thing, not the easy thing, and this is what that looks like. So relocating these [Confederate] monuments is not about taking something away from someone else. This is not about politics, this is not about blame; it\u2019s not about retaliation. This is not a naive quest to solve all our problems at once.\n\nThis is, however, about showing the whole world that we as a city, that we as a people, are able to acknowledge, to understand, to reconcile and most importantly, choose a better future for ourselves making straight what has been crooked and making right what was wrong. Otherwise, we will continue to pay a price with discord, with division and, yeah, violence.\n\nTo literally put the Confederacy on a pedestal in our most prominent places in honor is an inaccurate recitation of our full past. It is an affront to our present, and it is a bad prescription for our future. History cannot be changed. It cannot be moved like a statue. What is done is done. The Civil War is over, and the Confederacy lost\u2014and we are better for it. Surely we are far enough removed from this dark time to acknowledge that the cause of the Confederacy was wrong.\n\nAnd in the second decade of the 21st century, asking African Americans\u2014or anyone else for that matter\u2014to drive by property that they own; occupied by reverential statues of men who fought to destroy the country and deny that person\u2019s humanity seems perverse; it seems absurd. Centuries-old wounds are still raw because, you see, they never healed right in the first place. Here is the essential truth: We are better together than we are apart.\n\nIndivisibility is our essence. Isn\u2019t this the gift that, we, the people of New Orleans have given to the world? We radiate beauty and grace in our food, in our music, in our architecture, in our joy of life, in our celebration of death; in everything that we do. We gave the world this funky thing called jazz; it is the most uniquely American art form that is developed across the ages\u2014and from different cultures. Think about second lines, think about Mardi Gras, think about muffuletta, think about the Saints, gumbo, think about red beans and rice. By God, just think. All we hold dear is created by throwing everything in the pot; creating, producing something better; everything a product of our historic diversity. We are proof that out of many we are one\u2014and better for it. Out of many we are one\u2014and we really do love it! And yet, we still seem to find so many excuses for not doing the right thing. Again, remember President Bush\u2019s words, \u201cA great nation does not hide its history. It faces its flaws and corrects them.\u201d\n\nWe forget, we deny how much we really depend on each other, how much we really need each other. We justify our silence and inaction by manufacturing noble causes that marinate in historical denial. We still find a way to say, \u201cWait, wait, wait, not so fast.\u201d Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said, \u201cWait has almost always meant never.\u201d We can\u2019t wait any longer. We need to change. And we need to change now. No more waiting.\n\nThis is not just about statues, this is about our attitudes and behavior as well. If we take these statues down and don\u2019t change to become a more open and inclusive society, then all of this would have all been in vain. While some have driven by these monuments every day and either revered their beauty or failed to see them at all, many of our neighbors and fellow Americans see them very clearly. Many are painfully aware of the long shadows their presence casts; not only literally but figuratively. And they clearly receive the message that the Confederacy and the cult of the lost cause intended to deliver.\n\nEarlier this week, as the cult of the lost cause statue of P.G.T Beauregard came down, world renowned musician Terence Blanchard stood watch, his wife, Robin, and their two beautiful daughters at their side. Terence went to school on the edge of City Park named after one of America\u2019s greatest heroes and patriots, John F. Kennedy. But to get there, he had to pass by the monument to a man who fought to deny him his humanity.\n\nHe said, \u201cI\u2019ve never looked at them as a source of pride ... it\u2019s always made me feel as if they were put there by people who don\u2019t respect us. This is something I never thought I\u2019d see in my lifetime. It\u2019s a sign that the world is changing.\u201d\n\nYes, Terence, it is and it is long overdue.\n\nNow is the time to send a new message to the next generation of New Orleanians, a message about the future, about the next 300 years and beyond; let us not miss this opportunity New Orleans, and let us help the rest of the country do the same. Because now is the time for choosing. Now is the time to actually make this city we always should have been, had we gotten it right in the first place.\n\nWe should stop for a moment and ask ourselves\u2014at this point in our history\u2014after Katrina, after Rita, after Ike, after Gustav, after the national recession, after the BP oil catastrophe, after the tornado\u2014if presented with the opportunity to build monuments that told our story or to curate these particular spaces ... would these [...] monuments be what we want the world to see?\n\nIs this really our story?\n\nWe have not erased history; we are becoming part of the city\u2019s history by righting the wrong image these monuments represent and crafting a better, more complete future for all our children and for future generations. And unlike when these Confederate monuments were first erected as symbols of white supremacy, we now have a chance to create not only new symbols, but to do it together, as one people. In our blessed land we all come to the table of democracy as equals. We have to reaffirm our commitment to a future where each citizen is guaranteed the uniquely American gifts of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\n\nThat is what really makes America great, and today it is more important than ever to hold fast to these values and together say a self-evident truth that out of many we are one. That is why today we reclaim these spaces for the United States of America. Because we are one nation, not two; indivisible with liberty and justice for all ... not some. We all are part of one nation, all pledging allegiance to one flag, the flag of the United States of America. And New Orleanians are in ... all of the way. It is in this union, it is in this truth that real patriotism is rooted and flourishes. Instead of revering a four-year brief historical aberration that was called the Confederacy, we can celebrate all 300 years of our rich, diverse history as a place named New Orleans and set the tone for the next 300 years.\n\nAfter decades of public debate, of anger, of anxiety, of anticipation, of humiliation and of frustration. After public hearings and approvals from three separate community-led commissions. After two robust public hearings and a 6-1 vote by the duly elected New Orleans City Council. After review by 13 different federal and state judges. The full weight of the legislative, executive and judicial branches of government has been brought to bear and the monuments in accordance with the law have been removed. So now is the time to come together and heal and focus on our larger task. Not only building new symbols, but making this city a beautiful manifestation of what is possible and what we as a people can become.\n\nLet us remember what the once exiled, imprisoned and universally loved, now, Nelson Mandela and what he said after the fall of apartheid: \u201cIf the pain has often been unbearable and the revelations shocking to all of us, it is because they indeed bring us the beginnings of a common understanding of what happened and a steady restoration of the nation\u2019s humanity.\u201d\n\nSo before we part, let us again state the truth clearly. The Confederacy was on the wrong side of history and humanity. It sought to tear apart our nation and subjugate our fellow Americans to slavery. This is the history we should never forget and one that we should never, ever again put on a pedestal to be revered. As a community, we must recognize the significance of removing New Orleans\u2019 Confederate monuments. It is our acknowledgment that now is the time to take stock of, and then move past, a painful part of our history. Anything less would render generations of courageous struggle and soul-searching a truly lost cause.\n\nAnything less would fall short of the immortal words of our greatest president, Abraham Lincoln, who with an open heart and clarity of purpose calls on us today across the ages to unite as one people when he said: \u201cWith malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation\u2019s wounds ... to do all which may achieve and cherish\u2014a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.\u201d\n\nGod bless you all.

Because all Latinos look alike, am I right?\n\nIronically (or, perhaps, sadly) enough, at the time this was taking place, a demonstration against the arrest of undocumented immigrants was just wrapping up at the courthouse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAndrade-Tafolla is a U.S. citizen who has worked in the country for almost 20 years, according to The Oregonian.\n\nAn Oregon ACLU legal observer captured video footage of some of the interaction. In the background, a woman can be heard demanding to know whether the ICE agents had any identification on them or a warrant to conduct their business.\n\nAt any rate, the couple refutes the claim that Andrade-Tafolla is the man in the photo. Andrade-Tafolla\u2019s wife is not having it at all, adamantly stating, \u201cBitch, please, that is not my husband!\u201d She adds: \u201cYou are not part of the court, we do not know you. Please back away from my husband, please back away from our car before we call the cops.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Raw Story, Andrade-Tafolla refused to give the agents his ID but readily provided his name. Still the officers attempted to argue with him about his own damn identity, and it was only when another agent drove up and confirmed that Andrade-Tafolla wasn\u2019t the man in the photo that the agents left.\n\nTwo Oregonian lawmakers\u2014U.S. Reps. Suzanne Bonamici and Earl Blumenauer\u2014are now demanding a federal investigation into the two agents\u2019 behavior, saying that they were \u201cgreatly disturbed\u201d by Andrade-Tafolla\u2019s treatment.\n\nThe two Democrats sent a letter to Elizabeth Godfrey, the regional supervisor for ICE Enforcement, expressing their hopes that the agency would apologize to Andrade-Tafolla. Bonamici and Blumenauer also called into question ICE tactics, including the fact that the agents did not identify themselves during the stop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAs Oregon officials have repeatedly made clear, targeting immigration enforcement in areas near courthouses deters individuals from accessing our justice system and is contrary to the fair administration of law in Oregon,\u201d the letter read, according to The Oregonian. \u201cMore seriously, targeting U.S. citizens on the basis of race is a clear violation of their constitutional rights.\u201d\n\nOf course, ICE had nothing to say about the letter from the representatives, but bullshitted its way around an excuse as to why Andrade-Tafolla was treated the way he was.\n\n\u201cIn this instance, our officers went to a specific location seeking a particular individual and interacted with someone whom they believed resembled our arrest target,\u201d ICE spokesperson Virginia Kice told The Oregonian. \u201cIt turned out the man was not the target and no further action was taken.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKice reportedly also said that while officers must identify themselves as part of their official duties, sometimes they don\u2019t if they determine that the situation may be dangerous.\n\nSure, Jan.\n\nPlease tell me what was so dangerous about Andrade-Tafolla and his wife?\n\nThe Oregonian reports that the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation of Oregon has also lashed out, slamming the interaction as a \u201cclear case of racial profiling.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cICE can\u2019t just go around stopping anyone who looks Latino and asking them to show their papers,\u201d the Oregon ACLU said in the statement. \u201cThis is America.\u201d\n\nThe Oregon group claims that its legal observers have witnessed at least 10 people being detained by ICE officers at the courthouse since April, according to The Oregonian.\n\nRead more at The Oregonian and Raw Story.", "keywords": ["plainclothes", "wife", "oregon", "citizen", "officers", "video", "agents", "demanding", "identify", "latino", "andradetafolla", "man", "harassing", "ice", "caught", "oregonian", "letter"], "polarity": 0.0638591083713035, "subjectivity": 0.4377192590607224},

It started with statues of Confederate monuments but somehow morphed into black people wanting every piece of marble and stone tossed into the deepest volcano.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet me explain to you how this all started: The origin has many roots, but it blew up when pro-Confederate groups (I know you don\u2019t have a working mouth or tongue, but it\u2019s pronounced \u201cwyt suh prem uh sists\u201d) objected to the removal of the monument to the Battle of Liberty Place in New Orleans. Like most Confederate statues, the monument was a tribute to white people\u2019s 1874 losing effort when they took up arms to try to prevent black people from voting. If you look really close, you can still see the original inscription, which reads:\n\n[Democrats] McEnery and Penn having been elected governor and lieutenant-governor by the white people, were duly installed by this overthrow of carpet-bag government, ousting the usurpers, Governor Kellogg (white) and Lieutenant-Governor Antoine (colored). United States troops took over the state government and reinstated the usurpers but the national election of November 1876 recognized white supremacy in the South and gave us our state.\n\nNow, what right-minded black citizen of New Orleans would like to have his or her tax dollars go toward maintaining that?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen they tried to bamboozle us into believing that the statue of Jefferson Davis wasn\u2019t a tribute to white supremacy. They tried it, even though he turned traitor and took up arms against his own country to create his own nation that was exactly like the one he committed treason against, except the whole slave thing. Even though he is quoted as saying, \u201cWe recognize the fact of the inferiority stamped upon that race of men by the Creator, and from the cradle to the grave, our Government, as a civil institution, marks that inferiority.\u201d\n\nSo yeah, we saw a statue celebrating Davis as a little off-putting, as we did the monument to P.G.T. Beauregard, who helped create the Confederate flag along with William Thompson, who said this:\n\nAs a people we are fighting to maintain the heavenly ordained supremacy of the white man over the inferior or colored race; a white flag would thus be emblematical of our cause. Such a flag would be a suitable emblem of our young confederacy, and sustained by the brave hearts and strong arms of the south, it would soon take rank among the proudest ensigns of the nations, and be hailed by the civilized world as THE WHITE MAN\u2019S FLAG.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI hope you can see why we object to these Confederate statues. I know the conservative media have turned our distaste for monuments to white supremacy into a hate for all statues by using the straw man of the \u201cslippery slope argument.\u201d First they said we wanted to erase history\u2014as if the only way to learn about the past is by seeing stone replicas of it. Hell, they just made a statue of Martin Luther King Jr. the day before yesterday, and yet somehow we were already aware of his existence.\n\nThen they started saying that we wanted to eliminate statues of every slaveholder, which is just not true. Now some politician is saying he\u2019s worried about us wanting to tear down the monument to 9/11. I have no idea where that idea came from, but you know that white people are prone to hyperbole. They can\u2019t help it. It\u2019s like they\u2019re always playing a game of perpetual, historical telephone.\n\nDo you remember how they took a positive affirmation about self-worth and turned \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d into a terrorist group that wants to kill all police officers? Or how they turned a war about upholding slavery into some jumbled cacophony of bullshit about states\u2019 rights and Southern tradition? Well, that\u2019s what they are trying to do with this statue thing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019d just like you to know that we aren\u2019t like them. We are not in favor of ethnic cleansing like some people we know. We aren\u2019t asking for an executive order banning statues, or for statues to be rounded up and deported. We haven\u2019t grabbed tiki torches or asked for money to build a wall and make the monuments pay for it. I have yet to hear a single black person mention statues raping our women and how \u201csome, we assume, are good statues.\u201d\n\nA lot of the outrage you see about the non-Confederate statues is coming from white people offended on our behalf. It\u2019s not as if we adore slave owners like Thomas Jefferson and George Washington, but we are aware that slavery existed and that the celebration of them as great men must be placed in the context that all white men were white supremacist hypocrites who talked out of one side of their mouths about \u201cliberty and justice for all\u201d while participating in the evilest form of inhumanity. It\u2019s the American way.\n\nPlus, it\u2019s hard for us to get belligerent about racist inanimate objects when we have to deal with actual, real-life racism on a daily basis.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrust us, we know how you feel. We\u2019ve seen our people chopped down and returned to the earth, too. We know what it\u2019s like to be branded something you wish did not exist. To be hammered into something you do not wish to be. To have bits of yourself chipped away until you resemble something you are not. To be stolen from a land and slowly shaped into a different thing. To be fashioned into a memory. To stand in one place, unmoving, for centuries.\n\nDo not fear us, dear statues. We may not love you, but we live in a world where replicas of white supremacists are far less troubling and demeaning than living in a country whose leader has unleashed actual hordes of rock-headed throwbacks to a bygone era. We\u2019ve dealt with your existence for far too long to be worried about it now. Our sentiment about white statues echoes our sentiment about white people: Some of you are cool; we just wish you weren\u2019t in our faces so much.\n\nI hate cultural appropriation, but in order to adequately explain our position, I am forced to borrow one of the greatest lines in Caucasian history. I guess what we\u2019re trying to say is:\n\nNot all statues.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBlack people", "keywords": ["open", "confederate", "america", "turned", "took", "statue", "statues", "know", "white", "supremacy", "black", "monument", "letter"], "polarity": 0.07187110553587825, "subjectivity": 0.37934909156500063},

As previously stated, this was undertaken at the local level without the knowledge of senior management.

Motel 6 apologizes for this incident and will continue to work to earn the trust and patronage of our millions of loyal guests.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarlier:\n\nTwo Phoenix Motel 6 locations in predominantly Latino neighborhoods are suspected of calling federal immigration officials on undocumented guests who checked in for short stays with them.\n\nThe Phoenix New Times conducted a review of court records and found that between February and August, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents made 20 arrests at the same two Motel 6 locations in Phoenix.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne such arrest was that of 33-year-old landscaper Manuel Rodriguez-Juarez, who got a room at one of the two Motel 6 locations in June. When the front-desk clerk asked for ID, Rodriguez-Juarez showed the only thing he had\u2014a Mexican voter-ID card.\n\nSix hours later, three agents from ICE came to the hotel room and took him into custody after authorities say he admitted that he was not authorized to be in the United States. He is now being held at an immigration detention center in Florence, Ariz., while his lawyer tries to get him asylum.\n\nThat lawyer, Juan Rocha, believes that someone at Motel 6 tipped off ICE.\n\nAccording to the New Times, the statement of probable cause in Rodriguez-Juarez\u2019s case indicates that ICE officers were \u201cfollowing a lead\u201d when they arrested him. Department of Homeland Security records say that ICE\u2019s Phoenix Mobile Criminal Alien Team Unit received information that gave the exact number of the room where Rodriguez-Juarez was staying.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking to myself, \u2018How would they know that?\u2019\u201d Rocha told the New Times. \u201cThe client said he gave them a Mexican ID card\u2014but there\u2019s people who visit the U.S. all the time who have Mexican IDs. How does that establish that you\u2019re here without authorization?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m assuming it was a Motel 6 person\u2014I don\u2019t know who else would have told them\u2014thinking, \u2018Hey, this guy doesn\u2019t speak English, he has a Mexican ID card, I\u2019m going to call ICE,\u2019\u201d Rocha added.\n\nAlthough Motel 6 has not responded to direct inquiries about the arrests, employees at both locations told the New Times off the record that it is standard practice to send guest information to ICE.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe send a report every morning to ICE\u2014all the names of everybody that comes in,\u201d one front-desk clerk told the New Times. \u201cEvery morning at about 5 o\u2019clock, we do the audit and we push a button and it sends it to ICE.\u201d\n\nYasmeen Pitts O\u2019Keefe, a spokesperson for ICE\u2019s Phoenix division, would not tell the New Times whether or not the agency is acting on tips sent in by Motel 6 employees.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be able to confirm how we are getting our information.

And as the New Times notes, the company has been criticized by the American Civil Liberties Union for sharing guest lists with local police.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA 2015 Supreme Court decision made it so that a city cannot compel a hotel to turn over guest information without a warrant, so that means if front-desk staff are doing so in these cases, they are doing it voluntarily.\n\nLate Wednesday, after the report from the Phoenix New Times broke, Motel 6 posted the following statement on its Twitter account: \u201cThis was implemented at the local level without the knowledge of senior management.

Meanwhile, it\u2019s interesting that Politico reporters Elana Schor and Gabriel Debenedetti cite former Sweet Potato Saddam strategist Steve Bannon\u2019s previous claims that Democrats lose when they peddle identity politics, without denoting that Bannon, the white nationalist who ran the site with the black-crime section, peddles identity politics his damn self.\n\nThat tablespoon of irony aside, they note that some Democrats think fighting over monuments is impractical given that it speaks more to symbolism rather than substantive issues related to racism like voter suppression. However, now that we\u2019ve seen that people can be injured, if not murdered, over fights over Confederate monuments, the issue has since shown itself to be a matter of public safety. In other words, Democrats, get you some pols who can do both.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat aside, the piece ends with this dubious proclamation from a former paid Bernie Bro:\n\n\n\nVeteran Democratic strategist and ad maker Mark Longabaugh, a senior adviser to Bernie Sanders\u2019 2016 presidential campaign, recommended that the party\u2019s candidates \u201cfollow our values\u201d when it comes to thorny racial issues. \u201cAt the end of the day, America and most voters are pretty smart on this stuff,\u201d Longabaugh said. \u201cI don\u2019t think Bannon is going to fool anybody with his outright racist appeals.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsidering who is president and who came in second place in the Democratic primary, it\u2019s pretty apparent that Bannon does indeed fool plenty of voters\u2014including Bernie supporters. American voters aren\u2019t that smart. We have a reality-TV star and real-estate-scamming thot as president. Let\u2019s not bestow praise on an electorate that doesn\u2019t deserve it.\n\n\n\nFunny enough, data from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study\u2014an election survey of around 50,000 people\u2014recently revealed that 1 in 10 voters who supported Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary ended up voting for that big bag of orange soda and misspellings in the general election.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen there\u2019s that fun li\u2019l tidbit that highlights that, much on par with the double-duty deplorables, the Bernie-to-Bankruptcy Batista voters are just as delusional about white privilege and institutional racism as their deplorable brethren are.\n\nSanders has received a lot of criticism\u2014notably from me and especially on this site\u2014about the problems with his colorblind policy. Racism is an economic issue. As is sexism. As are homophobia and transphobia. The same goes for Islamophobia.\n\n\n\nThis is not hard, and I can help with the recipe for success. Talk about economic policy in all the aforementioned forms, rather than just \u201cJobs! Jobs! Jobs,\u201d and voil\u00e0, you might actually put together a winning coalition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSanders never got that, which is why he lost. Democrats should know this by now, given that it\u2019s not as if they\u2019ve had that great a portion of the white vote in decades.\n\nYet, here we are once again being met with articles expressing Democrats\u2019 anxiety over calling a thing a thing in an effort not to offend those racist fucks who don\u2019t fuck with the Democratic Party anyway.\n\n\n\nYou know who does seem to get it, though? Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).\n\n\n\nCNN reports:\n\nIn the months since then, Warren has increasingly added a focus on racism and cultural issues to her signature economic populism over several major speeches\u2014while also developing new relationships with black leaders across the country. Among them is Bernice King, the youngest daughter of Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King. The two spoke by phone, exchanged numbers and then met privately in Atlanta when Warren was in town for a progressive gathering. \u201cIn order for us to make effective change, leaders have to be courageous. They have to be willing to take a stance ... willing to lose some things,\u201d King said in an interview. \u201cAnd she was willing to risk some things in this process, being silenced on the floor.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter Hillary Clinton\u2019s defeat, Jamelle Bouie wrote \u201cKeep Hope Alive,\u201d which argued that Democrats have a road map to winning in the age of 45 if they follow the template Jesse Jackson laid out in the 1980s.\n\n\n\nCNN actually spoke to Jackson in the Warren piece:\n\nSome black leaders say they see major differences in Sanders\u2019 early 2016 candidacy and Warren today. \u201cWhen Sanders ran, he was very distant and had to learn how to relate to blacks,\u201d said Rev. Jesse Jackson. Warren represents a more diverse state, and \u201cshe does not talk with a strain; she talks with a comfort level and familiarity\u201d in speaking with black leaders, he added. Jackson said he and Warren speak \u201csemi-regularly\u201d and that the two have \u201copen access to each other.\u201d In July, he hosted Warren in Chicago for a speech to the Rainbow PUSH Coalition, a civil rights and political activist group he founded, where Warren hammered a legal system that fails to deliver justice when \u201cblack men and women die at the hands of those sworn to protect them\u201d and warned of GOP efforts to restrict voting access. In Warren, Jackson said he sees an economic message\u2014and a delivery\u2014that carries few cultural limitations. \u201cThe best news is that these issues affect whites in Appalachia and blacks in the Delta,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSanders may be teasing another presidential run, but if he doesn\u2019t learn how to make inroads with black voters, he\u2019ll once again be a crotchety sore loser in yet another primary race. The same fate will await Democrats in general next year and in every election cycle thereafter. I\u2019d like to think Democrats will listen to the professor, but they\u2019re clearly not that good at listening to smart women in their party.\n\n\n\nIn this current horror show of a presidential administration, Trump, his minions and Republicans nationwide are being quite audacious in how they perpetuate racism, be it symbolically or in terms of legislation. It\u2019s very clear what they believe.\n\nThe question is. what do Democrats believe and what are they willing to say? In recent months, we\u2019ve seen the likes of Nancy Pelosi say that Democratic candidates should not be forced to toe the party line on abortion. And since then, we\u2019ve seen Democratic hack after hack publicly opine on TV or in the op-ed pages of various newspapers that need higher standards that we shouldn\u2019t be fixated on matters like trans rights and black people being treated equally on every level.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy are so many of them so goddamn simplistic in their thinking? Why do they feel as if they have to grovel at the feet of the white working class at the expense of everyone else? Why is something as simple as conveying to the public that Robert E. Lee ain\u2019t shit so hard a task for some of them? New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu did an excellent job explaining the issue in May. Send him on tour, Democratic National Committee.\n\n\n\nIf the Democrats don\u2019t stop acting as if they have to be the political equivalent of unseasoned chicken to win, they are doomed. And I can\u2019t deal with several years of Gargamel in the House, the meanest and oldest Ninja Turtle in the Senate, and Heathcliff in the White (Nationalist) House.\n\nGet it together, dummies.

Inevitably, the whole awful exchange gets a screenshot, and then there\u2019s a 48-hour news cycle of said bigot claiming, I don\u2019t have a racist bone in my body or I was just reciting a rap lyric or I thought \u201cnooses\u201d were a popular brand of neckties in the black community.\n\n\n\nThis week\u2019s \u201cFace-bigotry\u201d comes courtesy of a fight over Confederate monuments in Georgia between a black woman, former Democratic state Rep. LaDawn Blackett Jones, and a white guy: current Republican state Rep. Jason Spencer (no relation to Richard Spencer \u2026 we think). Jones and Spencer, former colleagues in the Georgia Legislature, got into an argument about the role of Confederate monuments, which led Spencer to say if \u201cNorth Georgia\u201d Democrats like Jones tried to come downstate to agitate about statues, they might \u201cgo missing\u201d in the swamp.\n\nIn the wake of the Charlottesville, Va., terror attack, any fight about Confederate statues is national news, but in the state of Georgia this story is a bit more complicated. Jones is being depicted as the strong black woman fighting back against the racist white guy\u2014and while Spencer was out of line suggesting that Jones might go missing in a swamp, knowing her political history in Georgia, one might think that she could already be in \u201cthe sunken place.\u201d\n\n\n\nJones and Spencer sat next to each other in the Georgia Legislature from 2012 to 2016 and developed the kind of grudging relationship you create with your old high school friends who are racist but basically harmless. When Spencer started posting pictures in which he was proudly standing next to Confederate monuments in Georgia, Jones took the bait and went in, calling him a bigot, predicting that his children would abandon him and making Game of Thrones references (you can see the entire exchange here.)\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven after Spencer said, \u201cI guarantee you will not be met with torches but something a lot more definitive. People in South Georgia are people of action, not drama,\u201d Jones didn\u2019t seem fazed; she ended the whole conversation with sarcastic and laughing emojis.\n\nWhile the Facebook posts have brought the former representative national attention, Jones insists that she didn\u2019t take Spencer\u2019s \u201cthreats\u201d seriously. Which makes you wonder: What kind of African-American politician (current or former) gets into heated debates about the symbolism of Confederate monuments online but, when threatened with a Southern-style lynching, gives a big shoulder shrug?\n\nMaybe the kind of politician who likes to stir up racial drama but ain\u2019t really about that life. Jones served for four years in the Georgia Legislature before resigning to continue her law career full-time. During her short tenure, she made a name for herself as a rabble-rouser and trash-talker who was willing to make some strange alliances depending on who invited her to the cool-kids table.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJones was presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 Georgia campaign director in 2016, and after the election of Donald Trump, she chastised the Democratic Party for focusing too much on Native, Asian, African-American and LGBT issues and not giving enough attention to working-class white men. She even went so far as to say that the Democratic Party should create a \u201cwhite guy\u201d caucus to make sure white men don\u2019t feel left out of the political process. Is the teaspoon stirring yet?\n\n\n\nThe Georgia Democratic primary for governor is a competitive race between Stacey Abrams, head of the state Democratic caucus, who is vying to become the first black female governor in American history, and Stacey Evans, a lawyer and state representative from Cobb County who is seeking to become the 41st white female governor in American history. Evans also supports school vouchers, has been relatively silent on police brutality and violence against African Americans in her county, and straddles the fence so hard on Confederate monuments that she could split a pantsuit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite Evans\u2019 decidedly nonprogressive policy positions, Jones has become one of her biggest supporters in the Democratic gubernatorial campaign. Not only that, but Jones has adopted the tried-and-true position of becoming the official African-American attack dog of the Evans campaign\u2014every white Democrat facing a black Democrat has one. She has even been trotted out to question Abrams\u2019 \u201cblackness\u201d on the campaign trail, arguing at one point that Abrams, a black woman, would not be better or worse on racial policy issues than Evans, a white woman.\n\nWhen chants of \u201cTrust black women\u201d drowned out Evans\u2019 speech at the liberal Netroots Nation convention in Atlanta last month, it was LaDawn Jones who fired off a blog post and did interviews complaining how black women in the Democratic Party (the same black women who make up 40 percent of the Georgia primary electorate) aren\u2019t giving white \u201cprogressives\u201d enough space to speak.\n\nWhich brings us back to Facebook. It is easy to empathize with LaDawn Jones becoming the latest victim of Donald Trump-encouraged bigotry, and to enjoy her Face-bigotry clapback. However, before we crown her the Maxine Waters of the Dirty South, her role in Georgia politics has to be put in context. Jones can find it in her heart to forgive a racist death threat, endorses a candidate who is silent on local issues of criminal justice and believes that white men are the most aggrieved group in the national Democratic Party. All while going out of her way to chastise black female voters, the Democratic Party\u2014the party that 96 percent of black women voted for last fall\u2014and a black woman who is running for governor. Jones should have all of the seats, except of course in the Statehouse, where she no longer has one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat Rep. Spencer posted to Jones was a cowardly racist threat, and he should be punished by the Statehouse of Georgia. Jones\u2019 convenient racial anger on issues suits her, but her silence on others is problematic. Former constituents and African-American voters certainly don\u2019t want to see Jones disappear in the swamps of Georgia, but it might be a good idea if she dug herself out of the sunken place.", "keywords": ["missing", "evans", "confederate", "threatens", "place", "racist", "woman", "georgia", "jones", "spencer", "lawmaker", "ga", "white", "black", "democratic", "state", "sunken"], "polarity": 0.045709835336003556, "subjectivity": 0.37282228156059927},

Earlier Wednesday, after Lima-Marin had been released from his Colorado sentence, ICE officials took him into custody \u201cpending his removal to Cuba.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the Post, the U.S. does not control whether or not Cuba will accept a deportee, so it is possible that Lima-Marin, 38, could spend up to six months in ICE custody and then be put on an order of supervision that would require him to check in regularly with ICE authorities and possibly wear a GPS ankle bracelet.\n\nEarlier:\n\nA Colorado inmate who was sent back to prison to serve out the remainder of his sentence after it was discovered he was mistakenly released was given his freedom by a judge Tuesday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRene Lima-Marin was sentenced to 98 years in prison for robbing two video stores in 1998, and CNN reports that he was released improperly from prison in 2008. He was rearrested in 2014 when authorities discovered their mistake.\n\nOn Tuesday, in a 165-page decision, Arapahoe County District Judge Carlos Samour Jr. said, \u201cIt would be utterly unjust to compel Lima-Marin, at this juncture, to serve the rest of his extremely long sentence.\u201d\n\nLima-Marin was free for six years, and during that time he found a job, got married, started a family and bought a home, his attorney Kimberly Diego said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHis case was unique in that sense,\u201d Diego said. \u201cNot all people who are rehabilitated behave that way.\u201d\n\nThe judge\u2019s ruling noted that Lima had been called an \u201casset to society\u201d and an \u201coutstanding citizen\u201d who worked with children and encouraged them to make good decisions.\n\nFrom CNN:\n\nThe mix-up for the father of two boiled down to an error in paperwork that said Lima-Marin\u2019s sentences were to be served concurrently, instead of consecutively. Based on the paperwork, an attorney, who met with Lima-Marin in prison to discuss an appeal, told him that his sentence had been reduced to 16 years. The attorney advised him to forgo the appeal and instead wait to be released on parole in 2008. Lima-Marin\u2019s absence from prison wasn\u2019t noticed until Jan. 7, 2014, when a former prosecutor searched for his name on the DOC\u2019s inmate locator website and couldn\u2019t find it. Lima-Marin was arrested by 11 p.m. that same day in front of his family, according to Samour\u2019s report, in order to serve the remainder of his 98-year sentence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn his ruling, Samour said:\n\nIn effect, after its utter lack of care led to Lima-Marin\u2019s premature release and prolonged erroneous liberty, in January 2014, the government decided to compensate for its transgressions by swiftly turning back the clock and returning Lima-Marin to prison\u2014not through the use of a magic wand or the invention of a time machine built out of a DeLorean, which might have transported him back to his life in April 2008, but through the simple issuance of an arrest warrant, which merely put him back in prison, disregarding everything that had transpired between April 2008 and January 2014.\n\nAccording to CNN, Lima-Marin originally began his sentence in April 2000 after he was convicted of multiple counts of kidnapping, burglary, aggravated robbery and use of a deadly weapon during commission of a crime. It is noted that no shots were fired and no one was injured in any of the robberies that Lima-Marin committed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe judge called Lima-Marin a model citizen and said he completed five years of parole with flying colors. He added that the government acted with \u201cconscience-shocking\u201d indifference in reincarcerating Lima-Marin in 2014.\n\n\u201cRequiring Lima-Marin to serve the rest of his prison sentence all these years later would be draconian, would deprive him of substantive due process and would perpetrate a manifest injustice. Because the court finds that Lima-Marin is being unlawfully detained, he is ordered released. No other remedy will result in justice in this case,\u201d the judge said.\n\nDiego said that Lima-Marin is currently being held at the Fremont Correctional Facility in Canon City, Colo., and he could be released in the next day or two.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis is a really uplifting case,\u201d Diego said. \u201cThe judge was very thorough, took a lot of time and gave this case a lot of attention. You can tell he wanted to make sure this was perfect. We are thankful that he took the time that he did.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for the Colorado Attorney General\u2019s office said that it is currently reviewing the case.\n\n\n\nRead more at CNN.", "keywords": ["won", "immigration", "judge", "released", "colorado", "limamarins", "ice", "taken", "sentence", "custody", "release", "serve", "prison", "limamarin", "inmate"], "polarity": 0.08582175925925926, "subjectivity": 0.4627467439967439},

CNN reports that although DHS issued corrections, spokesman David Lapan characterized them as \u201cdata processing\u201d errors. Some jurisdictions said that they felt bound by court rulings to decline the detainer requests without a warrant.\n\nFrom CNN:\n\nImmigration advocates also criticized the list for singling out the criminals among undocumented immigrants without acknowledging the contributions of the broader population to their communities. When asked about the pushback, Lapan did not say that the move was a result of the response from cities and advocates, but did say a \u201cdialogue\u201d had been opened, as was partially the hope of the report. \u201cThere is no time frame associated with that (suspension) because it\u2019s based on a desire to make sure that we have quality data that the information that we\u2019re publishing is as accurate as we can be,\u201d Lapan said. \u201cAnd so (it will take) as long as it takes to get to that level of comfort that the secretary believes what we have is as good as it can be.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Los Angeles Times offers another take:\n\n\u201cThere have been some data processing errors, and some other issues,\u201d Lapan told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cWe want to make sure we look at this holistically and make sure we are getting this as accurate as possible.\u201d The department still intends to \u201clet the public know which jurisdictions have policies that do not assist ICE in its mission,\u201d he said, adding that he didn\u2019t know when the reports would resume. Under the Obama administration, a program called Secure Communities enlisted local police as partners in immigration enforcement. But there was a backlash after immigrants were detained and deported after minor violations like traffic tickets. And some court rulings have questioned the legality of police or jails continuing to hold someone without due process. One immigration rights advocate said the pullback points out the flaws in the new get-tough policy. \u201cOne of the fundamental problems with what the attorney general and President Trump are trying to do is to mobilize a massive deportation task force\u201d by shaming and pressuring states and cities, said Gregory Chen, director of advocacy for the American Immigration Lawyers Assn. \u201cThe fact that the federal government has had to pull back and apologize is a perfect example of how the federal government is overreaching here.\u201d Another point of contention: Just what does it mean to be a \u201csanctuary city?\u201d Some cities that won\u2019t honor detainers or detainers still work with ICE, by letting the agency know when someone is about to be released. One of them is Franklin County in south central Pennsylvania, which landed on the \u201cuncooperative\u201d list after ICE said the county jail was not honoring requests to hold five prisoners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHmm, sounds like DHS didn\u2019t really have it all together when it decided to go crazy and publish this report in the first place, which is a trait that has become all too typical of the current administration: Act hastily now, then try to spin and fix it later.\n\nNo one is arguing that a criminal who poses a real threat to the safety of U.S. citizens should not be detained\u2014indeed, keep those people in jail and let them go through the court system if they are indeed guilty of those crimes\u2014but do not use our criminal-justice system as a backup plan for ICE.\n\nThat seems unreasonable and a way to target people who otherwise would be able to continue to be contributing members of American society as they attempt to navigate the confusing labyrinth that is our immigration system.", "keywords": ["county", "administration", "wont", "detain", "immigration", "temporarily", "meant", "cities", "reports", "declined", "suspends", "list", "immigrants", "weekly", "ice", "detainers", "report", "shame", "detainer"], "polarity": 0.07233340871400576, "subjectivity": 0.4356041760892506},

Let\u2019s set aside his basketball commentary for a minute (where I still find him to be the NBA\u2019s most consistently entertaining and insightful commentator). Is there anyone who thinks that Barkley\u2019s statements about race reveal anything other than his repeated willingness to throw black people under the bus for our stupid unwillingness to assimilate into whiteness?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYeah, yeah, I know. I\u2019m sure some educated, right-leaning Negro conservative has already jumped in the comment section typing in all italics (because a black Republican would never use all caps, like a savage) about how \u201cblack people are not a monolith\u201d and something about questioning people\u2019s blackness. But let\u2019s be honest\u2014we all have a friend, co-worker or cousin who believes that the white man\u2019s ice is a few degrees colder, and no one exemplifies the black man\u2019s subconscious acceptance of white superiority more than Barkley.\n\nThe \u201cRound Assclown of Rebound\u201d was at it again Thursday, talking about politics and race with journalist Rick Karle, and as usual, he took white people\u2019s side of the issue.\n\nI\u2019m not gonna waste my time thinking about these Confederate statues. That\u2019s wasted energy. You know what I\u2019m gonna do? I\u2019m gonna keep doing great things. I\u2019m gonna keep trying to make a difference, number one in the black community, because I\u2019m black, but I\u2019m also gonna try to do good things in the world. I\u2019m not gonna waste my time screaming at a neo-Nazi who\u2019s gonna hate me no matter what, and I\u2019m not gonna waste my time ... worrying about these statues they got all over the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile that might sound a little benign, you must remember that Barkley only recently discovered racism after someone at TNT had the bright idea to let a man whose primary achievement in life was his uncanny ability to catch a basketball when someone else missed host a show about the intricacies of race in America. Unsurprisingly, Barkley, whose viewpoints consistently coincide with those of the oppressors of black America, decided that the best way to solve the race problem in America was to make a space on his national platform for white supremacist Richard Spencer.\n\nBut it was the second part of Barkley\u2019s comments on Thursday that really raised eyebrows and tightened anuses:\n\nWhat we as black people need to do, we need to worry about getting our education. We need to stop killing each other. We need to try to find a way to have more economic opportunity and things like that. Those things are important and significant.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApparently, Barkley believes that black people aren\u2019t worried about \u201cgetting our education.\u201d He parrots the same perspective as white people who interrupt every black liberation argument with, \u201cBut what about black-on-black crime?\u201d He obviously believes that black people miss out on economic opportunities because we are in the club \u201cmaking it rain\u201d or buying big rims for our shiny new cars.\n\nHere\u2019s an important piece of advice: Whenever anyone begins a sentence with \u201cWhat we as black people need to do is ... ,\u201d stop listening immediately. What is sure to follow will either be:\n\nA platitude you can get from any corner barbershop like \u201cUnite, and trust in Jesus\u201d\n\nSomething very Hotepish that combines the wisdom of ancient Egypt with jailhouse logic\n\nWhite-people solutions\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ve heard white-people solutions before. \u201cWhite-people solutions\u201d are the Caucasian answers to all black problems: \u201cWhite people circulate their dollar 120,333 times in the white community before it leaves their neighborhood.\u201d \u201cWhite people start reading to their kids when they are still a sperm.\u201d \u201cWhite people invest their money in stocks, pork futures and private prisons.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be clear, these aren\u2019t solutions for or by white people. Instead, they are the imaginings of black people who are white supremacists. Black white supremacists believe that the only correct way to do things is how they envision the white man would do it. A black white supremacist could never find anything wrong with a white man\u2019s methodology, so he or she continually contorts him- or herself to end up on the Caucasian side of the argument.\n\nAnd this is the difference between independent thinkers and black white supremacists. Most independent thinkers sometimes have legitimate disagreements with the accepted opinions of black America, but black white supremacists never find fault with white America, which means that everything ailing black people is black people\u2019s fault. For them, nothing\u2014not even the monuments of white supremacy\u2014is the fault of racism. We\u2019re just doing it wrong.\n\nI could explain to Barkley that a black child is more likely to go to an underfunded school, and how America spends $355 more per white student than it does on nonwhite students. I could point out that 84 percent of white people are killed by other white people, but no one ever mentions white-on-white crime. I could reveal to Barkley the disparities in business loans and hiring practices, but none of it would make any difference.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApparently, we don\u2019t focus enough on education and money, like the smart, genius Caucasians do, so ... umm ... that\u2019s why the statues shouldn\u2019t come down. Barkley answered a question about monuments to white supremacy by going into a rant about black-on-black crime and insinuating that it somehow had something to do with black people being dumb and poor. Because Barkley doesn\u2019t want to hear logic. He is a true believer in the infallibility and superiority of whiteness.\n\nBecause Charles Barkley is a white supremacist.", "keywords": ["im", "supremacists", "example", "america", "things", "race", "barkley", "great", "supremacist", "white", "need", "charles", "black", "gonna"], "polarity": 0.01839936633414897, "subjectivity": 0.36178900809335585},

The claims were originally made in a lawsuit filed against GEO Group, one of the largest private prison companies in the U.S., in 2014. However, the lawsuit recently gained class action status, making it the first time that a class action lawsuit accusing a private U.S. prison company of forced labor has been allowed to move forward, the Washington Post reports.\n\nMany of the allegations center around the Denver Contract Detention Facility in Aurora, Colo., which is owned and operated by GEO Group under a contact with ICE. Mind you, the facility was one of the GEO facilities that are used just to house immigrants awaiting their court dates to clarify their status. Some do not end up being deported.\n\nThe lawsuit was originally filed on behalf of nine immigrants who sought more than $5 million in damages, although the damages are expected to grow, given the new class action status. That status also means that up to 60,000 current and former detainees at the Denver Contract Detention Facility are now part of the lawsuit without having to jump on as plaintiffs.\n\nThe original nine plaintiffs claim that the detainees were forced to work without pay and that those who refused were threatened with solitary confinement. Plaintiffs claim that about six detainees were picked at random each day and forced to clean the facility\u2019s housing units, which the lawsuit says is a violation of the federal Trafficking and Victim Protection Act, which prohibits modern-day slavery, the Post notes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cForced labor is a particular violation of the statute that we\u2019ve alleged,\u201d Andrew Free, one of the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys, told the Washington Post. \u201cWhether you\u2019re calling it forced labor or slavery, the practical reality for the plaintiffs is much the same. You\u2019re being compelled to work against your will under the threat of force or use of force.\u201d\n\nGEO Group is also facing accusations that it paid at least $8 less than Colorado\u2019s mandated minimum wage of about $9 an hour, and thus \u201cunjustly enriched\u201d itself through the cheap labor of those being held.\n\nAs the Post notes, the troubling accusations have raised concern, particularly given President Donald Trump\u2019s promise to deport millions of undocumented immigrants, who may also be subject to inhumane treatment. Private prison companies also stand to benefit from Trump\u2019s harsh policy of detaining and deporting en masse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat means you need to round up and detain more people in order to determine whether they have the rights to stay in this country before you deport them,\u201d Nina DiSalvo, executive director of Towards Justice, a nonprofit that represents low-wage workers, including undocumented immigrants, told the Post. \u201cMore people could be moving through, not just in the Aurora facility. More people could be subjected to GEO\u2019s forced labor policy.\u201d\n\nIt is also worth noting, as the Post points out, that the stocks of GEO Group and CoreCivic, another huge private prison operator, have jumped since Trump\u2019s election. Both companies donated a collective $500,000 to Trump\u2019s inaugural celebrations.\n\nICE has declined to comment on any of the accusations because it is not \u201cspecifically a party in the suit,\u201d acting press secretary Jennifer D. Elzea told the Post.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it is ICE\u2019s Voluntary Work Program, which detainees sign up for to work and through which they are paid $1 a day, that gives the practice some legitimacy. In the program, detainees can work for up to eight hours a day, 40 hours a week, cleaning bathrooms, showers, toilets, windows and other locations. However, Jacqueline Stephens, who runs Northwestern University\u2019s Deportation Research Clinic, told the Post that the program does not align with labor laws\u2019 definition of volunteer work.\n\nGEO, for its part, is not so much denying that it makes the detainees work as much as it is denying that pay of $1 per day violates any laws.\n\n\u201cThe volunteer work program at immigration facilities as well as the wage rates and standards associated with the program are set by the federal government. Our facilities, including the Aurora, Colo., facility, are highly rated and provide high-quality services in safe, secure and humane residential environments pursuant to the federal government\u2019s national standards,\u201d GEO Group spokesperson Pablo Paez said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at the Washington Post.", "keywords": ["program", "forced", "laws", "prison", "class", "lawsuit", "claims", "thousands", "detainees", "post", "immigrants", "violating", "labor", "work", "ice", "private"], "polarity": 0.06507575757575758, "subjectivity": 0.3667946708463949},

His & Hers, which began as a podcast conceived and hosted by Smith and Hill, proved so popular that in 2014 it replaced the ESPN2 show Numbers Never Lie, which Smith began co-hosting with Charissa Thompson in 2011.\n\n\n\nSince then the duo have scored with many nonsports bits, like their spoofs of Empire, Anchorman and Boyz n the Hood, as well as relationship debates like whether women who reach for their wallets ever really intend to pay on dates.\n\nAnd while Hill and Smith have individual sports acumen that is undeniable, it\u2019s hard to ignore that their status as a male-female duo makes them all the more formidable. Even as sports broadcasting has actively beefed up its female ranks, the relationship that Hill and Smith enjoy is extremely rare. And now ESPN is rewarding that uniqueness with its ultimate prize: the 6 p.m. SportsCenter slot.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think for most [sports] people, you grew up watching SportsCenter, and it\u2019s ESPN\u2019s baby,\u201d says Hill, explaining the flagship\u2019s significance. \u201cI think for us, thinking about not only the position and the reverence it holds within the company is one layer to it, but another layer to it is all the prominent, legendary broadcasters that have come through the 6 p.m. SportsCenter\u2014somebody like Stuart Scott, Keith Obermann and Dan Patrick. So to follow in those footsteps is very meaningful.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s more than meaningful. It\u2019s also historic. Hill and Smith\u2019s SportsCenter takeover is the first for a black sports duo. Of course, individual black SportsCenter anchors in the 6 p.m. slot have not been an anomaly. In the early 1990s, Robin Roberts, who joined ESPN in 1990 and enjoyed a 15-year career there, became the first black woman to co-anchor the coveted SportsCenter slot.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the transition for Hill and Smith is noteworthy in that they both initially chose print as their primary medium and enjoyed successful stints at prominent papers like the Detroit Free Press and Orlando Sentinel for Hill and the Boston Globe for Smith, at a time when black sports professionals were much rarer. That shared background, however, is largely responsible for their personal and professional chemistry.\n\n\u201cJemele and I may be on the younger side [Editor\u2019s note: Hill is 41, Smith is 37] relative to some of our colleagues at ESPN, but we\u2019re dinosaurs in that we came up through the newspaper age, where it was like, either you were on newspaper and radio, where there was damn near no black people, or on television, which had mostly black people that were former athletes,\u201d says Smith, a New Orleans native.\n\n\u201cBecause we were so like-minded,\u201d recalls Hill, who hails from Detroit, \u201cand we had kind of very parallel careers, it just built an automatic kinship. Plus, we were at a point where we were coming to Bristol a lot. Neither one of us was based in Bristol, Conn. [where ESPN is based], and we were coming a lot, and so we started to hang out and go to dinner and go to movies together, and it just kind of established itself that way.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSportsCenter may look a little different, with its updated look, but it plays no significant role in Smith and Hill\u2019s grand scheme of making it uniquely their own. Instead, the pair promise that they are not deviating far from what has brought them to the dance in the first place.\n\n\u201cWe make [SportsCenter] ours the same way we did His & Hers\u2014just by being our unapologetic selves,\u201d vows Hill. \u201cThroughout this entire process and our journey together, the one principle Mike and I have always stuck to is: No matter what, we\u2019re going to go down swinging as ourselves. We\u2019re not going to sit there and use somebody else\u2019s idea of what television is.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a sort of period of where the audience has to get used to what we bring,\u201d Hill admits. \u201cWe\u2019re a pair that, while we can be serious, we don\u2019t take ourselves too seriously. We\u2019re bringing a lot of fun and spontaneity to this brand. This is what the ESPN brass wanted. They wanted us to be us. They didn\u2019t want us to come and try to be anyone else than what we\u2019ve already been. So it\u2019s going to be our own from day one because that\u2019s the only way that we know how to approach anything.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth of them are very much aware that their \u201cbe us\u201d approach and ESPN\u2019s embracing of it owe a lot to legendary SportsCenter anchor Stuart Scott, who brought hip-hop culture to the center of the network\u2019s sports coverage long before losing his battle with cancer in 2015.\n\n\u201cStuart had a lot of conversations and took a lot of bullets so we didn\u2019t have to,\u201d says Smith. \u201cHe made it OK to be you, to take risks and be outside the box.\u201d\n\nStill, that \u201cbrand of me\u201d doesn\u2019t work on everyone. \u201cThere are people from a viewership standpoint that\u2019s just never going to feel us. We\u2019re not going to be certain people\u2019s cup of tea because they are not even willing to taste it, and that\u2019s fine,\u201d says Smith.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Smith and Hill, SportsCenter is their Cavs championship. \u201cIt\u2019s like validation for all the sacrifices we made, all the hustle, all the grind,\u201d Smith explains. \u201cIt just goes to show that, if you stay true to yourself, the rest of the world, or the rest of the industry, will eventually catch up.

Journal apologized Thursday after being widely criticized for running a cartoon equating the young, undocumented immigrants known as \u201cDreamers\u201d with members of the criminal Latino gang MS-13.\n\n\u201cIt was a mistake,\u201d Karen Moses told Journal-isms by telephone on Friday. \u201cGoing forward, there definitely will be\u201d closer scrutiny of the cartoons selected for the newspaper.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t talk about how we make our decisions,\u201d Moses said, declining to disclose who made the decision to green-light the offending cartoon. However, Moses added that as the editor of the newspaper, with jurisdiction over its editorial pages, she takes responsibility.\n\nSimon Romero reported for the New York Times that the cartoon was \u201cprompting outrage from prominent Democrats and Republicans in the state.\u201d The illustration, by Sean Delonas, \u201cdepicts a white couple being accosted in a back alley by three men. One is holding the couple at gunpoint and taking the woman\u2019s purse. Another is wearing a jacket emblazoned with \u2018MS-13,\u2019 the name of a gang that President Trump and others have repeatedly invoked to denounce illegal immigration. The third has on a ski mask and a suicide vest of smoking explosives.\n\n\u201cThe male victim tells the woman, \u2018Now, honey ... I believe they prefer to be called \u201cDreamers,\u201d \u2018 a reference to young undocumented immigrants predominantly from Latin America, and adds, \u2018Or future Democrats.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe cartoon, which was published on Wednesday, quickly elicited criticism around New Mexico, where about 48.5 percent of the population is Hispanic, the highest percentage of any state in the country. Tensions have simmered in the state, which Mr. Trump lost in the 2016 election, over the federal government\u2019s immigration policies. . . . \u201c\n\nRomero also noted Moses\u2019 written apology, in which she said \u201cthat the cartoon \u2018appeared to us to be poking at President Trump\u2019s rhetoric by portraying a quaking Republican couple who were painting Dreamers with a broad, totally false, brush.\u2019\n\n\u201cBut Mr. Delonas, the cartoonist, said that while he sympathized with Ms. Moses, he disagreed with her assessment of the illustration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c \u2018That\u2019s not the way I read it,\u2019 said Mr. Delonas, 56, a former cartoonist at The New York Post. \u2018I\u2019ve learned that MS-13 is purposely sending minors over here to commit crimes. I\u2019m pretty sure that the cartels are using minors for a lot of their drug dealing.\u2019 . . .\u201d\n\nMoses told Journal-isms that she was not aware of previous controversies involving Delonas\u2019 cartoons, but \u201cI am now.\u201d\n\nAfter 23 years at the paper, Delonas took a buyout from the New York Post in 2013, during the Barack Obama administration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDuring a long career at the Post, Mr. Delonas was definitely un-PC,\u201d Kara Bloomgarden-Smoke wrote then for the New York Observer. \u201cHis cartoons for the tabloid at times attracted controversy \u2014 like his 2009 cartoon of a [cop] shooting a monkey, while [another cop quips] that they will need to find someone else to write the stimulus bill (prompting cries of racism since Mr. Delonas seemed to be equating a chimp with the president). . . .\u201d\n\nIn a rare move, the Post responded to the outcry by apologizing \u201cto those who were offended by the image.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, after the Associated Press reported on the New York Police Department\u2019s clandestine spying on Muslim communities, for which the AP won a Pulitzer Prize, Delonas depicted three Muslims making bombs in an apartment. Looking out the window at the police, one says, \u201cHello, AP Press? I\u2019d like to register a complaint against the N.Y.P.D. for spying on us.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Thursday, May Ortega, president of the New Mexico chapter of the National Association of Hispanic Journalists, wrote that she was dissatisfied with Moses\u2019 printed apology. \u201cThrough publishing this image, you have failed your community and your staff \u2014 some of whom we represent. We demand a proper apology for publishing this racist image and a retraction of it. And we ask that you implement a better internal system to avoid these kinds of regrettable actions.\u201d\n\nNationally, NAHJ issued a statement Friday saying, \u201cThis morning, NAHJ is able to report a meeting that occurred over the phone with Karen Moses, Editor-in-Chief of the Albuquerque Journal. This critical and sincere conversation included the EIC taking responsibility for the grave error, identified the issue allowing this to happen and laying out the preventative measures the Journal will be putting in place moving forward. . . .\u201d\n\nHowever, Moses told Journal-isms that the telephone call lasted 30 seconds \u2014 \u201cmaybe two minutes\u201d \u2014 and that she did not specify what preventative measures would be taken.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Journal did not participate in the 2017 newsroom diversity survey of the American Society of News Editors. Moses said there was \u201cquite a bit of diversity\u201d at her news organization, listing the managing editor, an editorial writer, the arts and entertainment editor and assistant sports editor as people of color.\n\n\u201cWe take it for granted,\u201d Moses said of diversity.\n\nElaine Baumgartel with May Ortega, KUNM-FM, University of New Mexico: Journalism Group Condemns Racist Cartoon Published By ABQ Journal (audio)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuzette Hackney, Indianapolis Star: Trump\u2019s tweet about Colts player\u2019s death full of deception\n\nEsther Yu Hsi Lee, thinkprogress.org: Cartoon depiction of Dreamers as gang members draws backlash from New Mexico residents\n\nRuben Navarrette Jr., Washington Post Writers Group: Trump should stop enabling American \u2018victims\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElizabeth Preza, Raw Story: This cartoon depicting DREAMers as gang members was so \u2018insanely racist\u2019 the newspaper had to apologize\n\nJulian Sancton, Vanity Fair: Sean Delonas: Stupid, Racist, or Both?

Their story was produced in collaboration with Univision Chicago, and made available in English and Spanish.\n\n\u201cIn 2017, the police department hired whites and Latinos at rates more than double that of African-Americans, who made up just 17 percent of the total 1,126 new hires,\u201d Stark and Litttle continued. For Univision, the angle for the story, written by Adriana Cardona Maguigad, was, \u201cMore Hispanics make it through the CPD hiring process but African Americans are falling behind.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStark and Little wrote, \u201cIt\u2019s not that blacks shy away from seeking police jobs. A Chicago Reporter examination of police hiring data going back to 2013 \u2014 the most complete recruitment records available \u2014 shows that many African-Americans have applied to the force in recent years. They just haven\u2019t been hired, hurting efforts to further diversify the department as it struggles to improve its relationship with black communities.\n\n\u201cOf more than 8,000 black applicants, nearly 30 percent didn\u2019t show up for the written entrance exam, the first step in the recruitment process, while 17 percent failed the test, according to data analyzed by the Reporter. Many applicants who passed the test later dropped out of the process, which includes an extensive background check and physical, psychological and drug tests.\n\n\u201cIn some policing circles, the prevailing sentiment has been that few African-Americans were interested in joining the force. But the five-year data indicate a different story: When it comes to cultivating black candidates, the issue may be retention, not recruitment, in a multistep process that can take years. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow a Police Department Institutionalizes Racism\n\nFrom 2013 to 2017, members of the Columbus, Ohio, Division of Police \u201cfatally shot 28 people, according to Mapping Police Violence.

But aggressive behavior by officers often goes unchecked by the department \u2014 which is backed by a powerful police union \u2014 and decades of non-indictments from the prosecutor\u2019s office for those who kill shows how, in Ohio\u2019s [capital], the victim\u2019s families are often silenced and officers\u2019 perspective becomes the main narrative.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe CPD has operated this way for decades \u2014 a narrative not dissimilar to other police departments across the country. But how does that sort of aggression, that deep-seated racism, become institutionalized into an organization?

Her personal twitter doesn\u2019t contain an ESPN handle nor was it given to her by ESPN, so I\u2019m trying to understand how she was violating \u201ccompany interest\u201d by talking about Donald Trump. What company interest do we have with the White House? Politics don\u2019t seem to matter when we allow it in our content regularly and we didn\u2019t seem to care when we hosted town halls with President Obama (which I loved BTW). So exactly how was she violating company policy? She didn\u2019t once mention ESPN in her comments nor did she imply she was speaking on behalf of ESPN. It\u2019s awfully funny how we have employees who get arrested, mugshots plastered all over social media and news outlets, and the statement we get from the company is \u201cwe\u2019re looking into the matter.\u201d Nothing more, nothing less. But Jemele uses her personal platform to speak out on how she feels as a black woman in America (where I can certainly relate) and the company issues statements distancing themselves? I am disappointed in ESPN, as much as I love this company and love working here, that we care more about the perception of someone\u2019s words than someone\u2019s criminal action. A simple disclaimer such as, \u201cThe tweets of Ms. Hill do not represent ESPN or it\u2019s political views; however, we stand behind Ms. Hill\u2019s right to express her views and opinions on her personal platform as an American citizen,\u201d would have sufficed.

I have to admit, the headline was a lapse in judgment (admittedly so) by a former employee, who was promptly fired for what was viewed as having a potential racist tone. The writer of the piece apologized profusely and I sincerely believe that he meant no ill will or was in any manner attempting a racist pun (however he was still fired).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTurn the clock ahead 5 years and as a company we are allowing someone to use terms such as \u2018white supremacist\u2019, calling the President of the United States (the leader of our country) a \u2018bigot,\u2019 without much more than a slap on the wrist. While I agree in the amendment of freedom of speech\u2014I believe that people with a platform (such as Jemele) should be using it to lift people up and turn negatives into positives. No matter what you think of President Trump, why not take the higher road and use your talents to try and make this country a better place to live and this company a better place to work? Too many people take advantage of what the freedom of speech actually means and take it as their podium to complain and spew garbage.\n\nOverall, I am very disappointed that the company did not take a more aggressive stance against what was said. Hopefully it is not too late, as I find it difficult to respect policies that are not consistent from case-to-case.\n\nYellow responding to Dark Blue\n\nWas Jemele formally writing on behalf of ESPN? No. That person was racially insensitive. Jemele was simply stating her opinion as others do on social media every single day. As you are doing here. Should you get fired for that? Of course not.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDark Blue responding to Yellow\n\nWhat I was trying to get across is what the ESPN writer wrote was allegedly a mistake that was taken into a different context than what he intended. What Jamele wrote was very intentional and obviously how she feels. I cannot fault her for how she feels about what she stated. However I do believe that anything that an employee of ESPN writes on social media (and as you pointed out, my opinions on this forum) are up for scrutiny and can be seen as representing the company. If I slandered someone or made rationally insensitive comments (which, in my opinion, she did) \u2014 I would expect actions to be taken.\n\nI see social media as an extremely powerful tool - if used wisely, we can learn from one another and grow together. In cases such as these, it causes more of a divide and can tear us apart.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPink on September 14 at 5:15 PM\n\nQuestions:\n\nWhen Hank Williams Jr. was being interviewed by Fox News, was he speaking for ESPN or speaking on an ESPN platform?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Curt Schilling posted a cartoon on Facebook, was he speaking for ESPN or speaking on an ESPN platform?\n\nI\u2019m actually stunned that there are people willing to defend her because her message above is clearly not an apology, it was a double down. And there are roughly 63 million people who voted for and support the president , and I\u2019m willing to bet that they\u2019re not happy being called white supremacists. I\u2019m certainly not. It\u2019s offensive. And we\u2019re going to lose even more viewers as a result. How does this just keep getting worse?\n\nOrange responding to Pink\n\nMy better sense is to assume that no one cares about what I think, but I agree with your comment. Whether you support the president or don\u2019t, the fact is that ESPN\u2019s brand suffers when these happen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI follow ESPN on social media for sports. I watch it for sports and sports commentary . On social media I see in almost every post, droves of comments about how we get involved politically and lean one way over another. Trolls maybe? But these sentiments combined with our loss of subscribers is not helped when these happen. Could this effect future distribution deals as we try to get carried by DMVPDs? Who knows, but it doesn\u2019t help.\n\nOn a positive note, when we did the Ocho, I was hard pressed to find comments that bashed us. The comments were fun and on topic, praising us for showcasing a varied array of sports. While viewership wise it didn\u2019t do well, I think it helped our brand, and I hope we continue to do things like that.\n\nWe have outlets that can venture Outside The Lines \ud83d\ude0a but the viewer expects that from that shows angle, even E:60.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut when SportsCenter inadvertently does it, or ESPN\u2019s brand (or a perceived spokesperson for the brand) I think it\u2019s damaging.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreen on September 15 at 10:35 AM:\n\nRegardless of how you fee l about the content of Jemele\u2019s tweets, the fact is that because of her forward facing role at ESPN, anything she says or writes will be considered by the public to represent ESPN. That goes for anyone who has a forward facing role.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat\u2019s disappointed me most over the last month is how often ESPN has made news, rather than reporting it. In today\u2019s overly political environment, that\u2019s not good for us. Although I\u2019m clearly not in a position to tell our talent how they should communicate, I would encourage t hem to think carefully about what and how they communicate, and its impact on the company. Although it\u2019s been overused, Herm Edwards\u2019 quote about \u201cthink before hitting send\u201d never had more meaning than now ...\n\nRed responding to Green\n\nThe same should be said for 45. He is \u201csupposed\u201d to be the forward face and representation of the United States. What saddens me most is how ESPN has made themselves look to the Nation with a \u201cfor sale\u201d sign around a specific group of people\u2019s neck, on their own network. Any repercussions? Anyone reprimanded publicly? No. Where was the assembly line of support on ITK about this?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGreen responding to Red\n\n[Red], we can\u2019t control what the President does with his communications, and his job status/security is a political, not business, issue. While I find POTUS\u2019 behavior reprehensible (and that\u2019s being kind), if I were a forward facing ESPN employee, I would be very careful in stating my views on his performance, b/c regardless of the forum/venue I stated such views, they will be interpreted by someone as my speaking on ESPN\u2019s behalf. This is clearly not fair, but it\u2019s reality.\n\nWhile the Constitution guarantees that the government can\u2019t prohibit free speech, such freedoms don\u2019t necessarily apply to private businesses. Remember that last month Google fired an employee for his views on women in technology. Whether or not you, I or anyone else agreed/disagreed with his opinions, no one disputes that Google had the right to terminate his employment (whether Google should have done so is a debate for another time ...) .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat we have to remember is that b/c of ESPN\u2019s position in business, media, and culture, there are numerous folks/organizations who want nothing better than to take a piece of our hides. Our talent especially have to keep this in mind with every interaction they have. Again, not fair, but reality.\n\nRed responding to Green\n\nIt depends on who is on the \u201cchopping block.\u201d As we can see. And \u201cfair\u201d is no where to bee seen. Reality.

His & Hers, which began as a podcast conceived and hosted by Smith and Hill, proved so popular that in 2014 it replaced the ESPN2 show Numbers Never Lie, which Smith began co-hosting with Charissa Thompson in 2011.\n\n\n\nSince then the duo have scored with many nonsports bits, like their spoofs of Empire, Anchorman and Boyz n the Hood, as well as relationship debates like whether women who reach for their wallets ever really intend to pay on dates.\n\nAnd while Hill and Smith have individual sports acumen that is undeniable, it\u2019s hard to ignore that their status as a male-female duo makes them all the more formidable. Even as sports broadcasting has actively beefed up its female ranks, the relationship that Hill and Smith enjoy is extremely rare. And now ESPN is rewarding that uniqueness with its ultimate prize: the 6 p.m. SportsCenter slot.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think for most [sports] people, you grew up watching SportsCenter, and it\u2019s ESPN\u2019s baby,\u201d says Hill, explaining the flagship\u2019s significance. \u201cI think for us, thinking about not only the position and the reverence it holds within the company is one layer to it, but another layer to it is all the prominent, legendary broadcasters that have come through the 6 p.m. SportsCenter\u2014somebody like Stuart Scott, Keith Obermann and Dan Patrick. So to follow in those footsteps is very meaningful.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s more than meaningful. It\u2019s also historic. Hill and Smith\u2019s SportsCenter takeover is the first for a black sports duo. Of course, individual black SportsCenter anchors in the 6 p.m. slot have not been an anomaly. In the early 1990s, Robin Roberts, who joined ESPN in 1990 and enjoyed a 15-year career there, became the first black woman to co-anchor the coveted SportsCenter slot.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the transition for Hill and Smith is noteworthy in that they both initially chose print as their primary medium and enjoyed successful stints at prominent papers like the Detroit Free Press and Orlando Sentinel for Hill and the Boston Globe for Smith, at a time when black sports professionals were much rarer. That shared background, however, is largely responsible for their personal and professional chemistry.\n\n\u201cJemele and I may be on the younger side [Editor\u2019s note: Hill is 41, Smith is 37] relative to some of our colleagues at ESPN, but we\u2019re dinosaurs in that we came up through the newspaper age, where it was like, either you were on newspaper and radio, where there was damn near no black people, or on television, which had mostly black people that were former athletes,\u201d says Smith, a New Orleans native.\n\n\u201cBecause we were so like-minded,\u201d recalls Hill, who hails from Detroit, \u201cand we had kind of very parallel careers, it just built an automatic kinship. Plus, we were at a point where we were coming to Bristol a lot. Neither one of us was based in Bristol, Conn. [where ESPN is based], and we were coming a lot, and so we started to hang out and go to dinner and go to movies together, and it just kind of established itself that way.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSportsCenter may look a little different, with its updated look, but it plays no significant role in Smith and Hill\u2019s grand scheme of making it uniquely their own. Instead, the pair promise that they are not deviating far from what has brought them to the dance in the first place.\n\n\u201cWe make [SportsCenter] ours the same way we did His & Hers\u2014just by being our unapologetic selves,\u201d vows Hill. \u201cThroughout this entire process and our journey together, the one principle Mike and I have always stuck to is: No matter what, we\u2019re going to go down swinging as ourselves. We\u2019re not going to sit there and use somebody else\u2019s idea of what television is.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a sort of period of where the audience has to get used to what we bring,\u201d Hill admits. \u201cWe\u2019re a pair that, while we can be serious, we don\u2019t take ourselves too seriously. We\u2019re bringing a lot of fun and spontaneity to this brand. This is what the ESPN brass wanted. They wanted us to be us. They didn\u2019t want us to come and try to be anyone else than what we\u2019ve already been. So it\u2019s going to be our own from day one because that\u2019s the only way that we know how to approach anything.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth of them are very much aware that their \u201cbe us\u201d approach and ESPN\u2019s embracing of it owe a lot to legendary SportsCenter anchor Stuart Scott, who brought hip-hop culture to the center of the network\u2019s sports coverage long before losing his battle with cancer in 2015.\n\n\u201cStuart had a lot of conversations and took a lot of bullets so we didn\u2019t have to,\u201d says Smith. \u201cHe made it OK to be you, to take risks and be outside the box.\u201d\n\nStill, that \u201cbrand of me\u201d doesn\u2019t work on everyone. \u201cThere are people from a viewership standpoint that\u2019s just never going to feel us. We\u2019re not going to be certain people\u2019s cup of tea because they are not even willing to taste it, and that\u2019s fine,\u201d says Smith.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Smith and Hill, SportsCenter is their Cavs championship. \u201cIt\u2019s like validation for all the sacrifices we made, all the hustle, all the grind,\u201d Smith explains. \u201cIt just goes to show that, if you stay true to yourself, the rest of the world, or the rest of the industry, will eventually catch up. They\u2019ll learn to like it, and they did.\u201d\n\n", "keywords": ["smiling", "hill", "jemele", "going", "lot", "michael", "scott", "way", "smith", "sportscenter", "espn", "stuart", "thats", "duo", "taking", "black"], "polarity": 0.20560125060125053, "subjectivity": 0.539087061087061},

Bannon was asked specific questions that had been negotiated between the White House and the House\u2019s lead counsel.\n\nBannon had been subpoenaed by the committee on Jan. 16 but managed to postpone the subpoena deadline three times as the White House and House lawyers negotiated which questions he could answer without the White House invoking executive privilege to prevent him from testifying.\n\nDemocrat Rep.

Bannon was asked specific questions that had been negotiated between the White House and the House\u2019s lead counsel.\n\nBannon had been subpoenaed by the committee on Jan. 16 but managed to postpone the subpoena deadline three times as the White House and House lawyers negotiated which questions he could answer without the White House invoking executive privilege to prevent him from testifying.\n\nDemocrat Rep. Adam Schiff of California, ranking member of the committee, told reporters: \u201cThe only questions he would answer were questions that had been scripted, literally scripted for him by the White House.

He didn\u2019t want to hold a congressional hearing, convene an investigative committee or appoint a special prosecutor. No, when Ol\u2019 Jughead James discovered that America\u2019s mortal enemy was trying to undermine the foundation of American democracy, he wanted to write an article about it.\n\nAccording to Newsweek, Comey gathered Attorney General Loretta Lynch, Secretary of State John Kerry, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, national security adviser Susan Rice and others to inform them that Russia was trying to hack the election. Instead of advocating for sanctions, a diplomatic solution or even counterintelligence, the FBI director held up a piece of paper with an outline and offered to fight what amounts to an act of war by writing a public opinion piece. \u201cHe had a draft of it or an outline.

After he investigated the Hillary Clinton email scandal and declared that the Justice Department would not indict her, the FBI chief sent a letter to Congress informing its members that he was reopening the investigation. Then, three days before the election, the Lurch look-alike penned another letter that basically said, \u201cMy bad. I didn\u2019t find out anything new,\u201d and closed the Clinton case again.

I accept full responsibility for my actions.\n\nYes, he did invoke his military service and his faith in God.\n\nClearly, former FBI Director James Comey was not going to let that slide, because he sent out the most epic subtweet, complete with biblical-Scripture quote:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd the accompanying Instagram post shows us just how deep Comey\u2019s petty runs:\n\nAs has been said many times this morning already, this finna be good.\n\nEarlier:\n\nMichael Flynn, the former national security adviser to Donald Trump, pleaded guilty Friday to charges of lying to the FBI about conversations he had with the Russian ambassador last December during the presidential transition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe New York Times reports that Flynn made an appearance in a federal court in Washington, D.C., as part of a plea deal that inches special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election just a bit closer to Donald Trump\u2019s inner circle.\n\nFlynn lasted only 24 days as national security adviser before being forced to resign after it was revealed that he had lied to Vice President Mike Pence about his conversations with Russian officials during the presidential transition.\n\nSo did he really lie to Pence, or was Pence also complicit? Is Jared Kushner now dangling in the wind? Could Flynn be preparing to testify against the president himself?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe charges Flynn pleaded guilty to Friday morning amount to a veritable slap on the wrist in comparison with all the evidence stacked against him, and they are nothing compared with the charges faced by another Trump associate, Paul Manafort.\n\nManafort was charged with conspiracy against the United States, to which he pleaded not guilty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo the question is, with Flynn pleading guilty to this light-as-a-feather charge, what is he getting\u2014and giving\u2014in exchange?\n\nThere is no way Mueller is granting plea deals for small fish. Flynn has to be dropping the goods on someone big\u2014maybe more than one someone.\n\nThis is also a clear indication that Mueller\u2019s team was able to flip Flynn, but not Manafort. Manafort took his lumps, pleaded not guilty to the charges and now waits to see what happens next.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFlynn, on the other hand, was apparently as nervous as a sow at a North Carolina pig-pulling when it became clear that the investigators would stop at nothing to get to the dirt, even if it meant taking his son Michael G. Flynn down with him.\n\nHe was ready to sing, but which song did he pick?\n\nMy money is on the Kushner-Pence-Trump trifecta. For as smug as Pence is, you know he had to know a lot. He did not operate in that campaign in the dark. He is just as complicit as his boss and his boss\u2019s puppet of a son-in-law.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf we are lucky, Donald Trump Jr. will go down, too.\n\nAt this point, Michael Flynn is Nino Brown to the bullshit, and I\u2019m here for it. \u201cIf I\u2019m going down, I\u2019m taking all y\u2019all with me.\u201d\n\nSing, Michael Flynn. Sing. Sing until you can\u2019t sing no more.\n\nWe need to flush the toilet on this administration and power-wash the White House.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe only way to do that is to get everyone out first.\n\nRead more at the New York Times.", "keywords": ["responds", "charges", "james", "pleaded", "michael", "flynn", "trump", "releases", "russian", "sing", "subtweet", "pence", "times", "lying", "pleading", "guilty", "statement"], "polarity": 0.015477855477855481, "subjectivity": 0.45993839493839483},

Because Sessions straight up lied during his Senate confirmation hearing, claiming that he\u2019d never met with Russian officials, he recused himself from all Russia-related matters.\n\nNow, according to several reports, Trump was not only pissed that Sessions recused himself from the Justice Department\u2019s investigation into potential ties between Russia and the Trump campaign, but he reportedly ordered his top lawyer to try to stop Sessions from doing so.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, White House counsel Don McGahn, acting on orders from the president, tried but failed to persuade Sessions not to recuse himself.\n\nNBC News reports that McGahn and several White House officials called Sessions to insist that he not recuse himself, but Sessions had already made up his mind after reports surfaced that Sessions had conveniently forgotten to disclose contacts he\u2019d had with Russia\u2019s ambassador to the United States.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter recusing himself in March, Sessions would suddenly remember several interactions he had with Russians during Senate committee hearings in June and October.\n\nA White House lawyer for Trump, Ty Cobb, told NBC News that he had no comment on the Times report.\n\n\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that the Trump administration has been vocal about Sessions\u2019 recusal. In fact, during a July press conference, Trump blatantly stated that he didn\u2019t believe that Sessions should have taken himself out of the investigation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe should not have recused himself from the Russia investigation almost immediately after he took office, and if he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me prior to taking office, and I would have quite simply picked somebody else,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair to the presidency.\u201d\n\n\n\nOne thing has been consistent since Trump took office, and that\u2019s the fact that skullduggery, lying and Russia\u2019s raiding of the White House fridge at ungodly hours is the new state of the nation.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter what comes out of this administration; at this point, this is how I feel about every claim lobbed at the president:\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at the New York Times and NBC News.", "keywords": ["lawyer", "recused", "urged", "house", "recuse", "persuade", "jeff", "reports", "russia", "investigation", "times", "white", "trump", "report", "probe", "sessions"], "polarity": 0.020730027548209365, "subjectivity": 0.3796700773973502},

Flynn, who worked as a part of Flynn Intel Group. The younger Flynn accompanied his father in 2015 on the trip to Russia where the elder Flynn appeared at a Moscow dinner sitting next to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nIn addition, ABC News reports that Democrats in Congress forwarded information to the Mueller team allegedly showing that during his confirmation process, Flynn illegally concealed more than a dozen foreign contacts and overseas trips.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a letter to Flynn\u2019s attorney, Democratic Reps. Elijah Cummings and Eliot L. Engel wrote, \u201cIt appears that General Flynn violated federal law by omitting this trip and these foreign contacts from his security clearance renewal application in 2016 and concealing them from security clearance investigators who interviewed him as part of the background check process.\u201d\n\nThe information the congressmen reference is information House investigators collected from executives at three private companies Flynn advised in 2015 and 2016 prior to joining then-candidate Trump on the campaign trail.\n\nFlynn was named as Trump\u2019s first national security adviser, but 24 days later, he was forced to resign when it was revealed that he had lied to Vice President Mike Pence about his conversations with Russian officials during the presidential transition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe has, over and over, omitted information that he should have disclosed,\u201d Cummings told ABC News. \u201cIt\u2019s not an aberration, and that\u2019s clear.\u201d\n\nCummings said that intentionally omitting foreign contacts when applying for security clearance can carry a five-year prison term, but acknowledged that penalties are rarely so severe.\n\nThe alleged transgressions do, however, provide the type of leverage that prosecutors can use to compel Flynn to assist in the broader investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at ABC News.", "keywords": ["abc", "michael", "president", "flynn", "information", "legal", "russian", "team", "told", "security", "testify", "trumps", "preparing"], "polarity": 0.030451127819548868, "subjectivity": 0.2551691729323308},

They targeted civil rights activists for years.\n\nWe really don\u2019t have proof of the Russians doing anything. Why trust these agencies now?\n\nThese are completely legitimate questions that I hear from black folks from time to time on social media and in person. I get it. Black people have a very conflicted relationship with law enforcement, be it local or federal policing. There are plenty of examples throughout the decades of these powerful entities harming black communities. Yet we depend on them to protect and serve us, despite their horrendous records of abuse.\n\nThe FBI has a particularly violent history (and if we are discussing the intelligence community in general, that extends to the present) of being aggressive against black liberation movements. COINTELPRO, for example, was one of the most disruptive anti-black law-enforcement programs the nation has ever waged against black civil rights activists.\n\nYet today the FBI stands as the single most important federal entity that will ultimately determine whether charges should be filed against people in Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign for working with Russian entities to secure his victory on Election Day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJeffrey O.G. Ogbar, a historian at the University of Connecticut who researches the history of law enforcement targeting black people, told me he looks at the FBI the same way he does police agencies, school systems, the military or any other institution in the United States over the course of history. Ogbar brings up the history of the Atlanta Police Department as an example. One-quarter of the officers were once allegedly Ku Klux Klan members, and black officers could not arrest white people until 1960, Ogbar told me. By comparison, today\u2019s Atlanta Police Department is majority African American and has black leadership.\n\n\u201cInstitutions aren\u2019t static,\u201d said Ogbar, who believes the intelligence community\u2019s assessment of Russian collusion. \u201cI can\u2019t see the Atlanta Police Department the same as it was in 1960, any more than I can think [the] FBI is the same as it was in 1960. It doesn\u2019t mean it is incapable of committing some of the same offenses as it did before.\u201d\n\nFor me, one of the toughest facts to respond to is that there is no publicly available smoking gun proof connecting the Democratic National Committee hack and other disinformation efforts to the Kremlin. The intelligence report released (pdf) in January is an assessment of what happened, not proof of an actual crime. It\u2019s the job of the FBI and special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation to figure out if any crime happened from either the Russian or Trump sides.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nC. Christian Grant, who spent 12 years as an FBI and Defense Intelligence Agency officer, told me it could take decades before Americans learn the real facts of the Russia investigation. For starters, if the intelligence community laid out every detail of proof it has of Russia collusion, it could hamper the current investigation and even lead to the loss of life.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you divulge that information, you run the risk of divulging sources and collecting methods, and you want to still continue to be able to collect [information],\u201d Grant, who is African American and tracked Russian targets in the U.S. for four years, told me. \u201cThat information is probably held by a small number of individuals or possibly one individual. If that information gets out, Russia, as you know, has a way of dealing with spies and folks who they think are giving up information.\u201d\n\nA recent example of the FBI\u2019s surveillance of black people dates back to the years after 9/11, when, Vice reported, the bureau identified Ayyub Abdul-Alim as a possible informant who could spy on members of the Mosque of the Islamic Brotherhood in Harlem, which was connected to the black nationalist movement during the 1960s. Somehow, the FBI drew a connection between black nationalism and al-Qaida, Michael German, a fellow with the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University and a former FBI special agent specializing in terrorism, told Vice earlier this year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe [FBI] files suggest that Muslims with family connections to black nationalist groups of the 1960s and 1970s were, after 9/11, viewed as suspicious, as part of the heightened focus on international terrorism and al-Qaida,\u201d German said.\n\nAbdul-Alim is serving a four- to six-year sentence for illegal-gun-possession charges. He believes that the charges are connected to his refusal to become an FBI informant.\n\nOf course, the Russia investigation is a different can of worms. But the case of Abdul-Alim is another example of how our federal agencies have tried to draw conclusions that simply are not there. There was no proof of criminal activity at the Mosque of the Islamic Brotherhood, but the possibility of criminality was strongly considered after Sept. 11.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI asked Grant, the FBI and DIA officer, if he was ever asked to spy on black organizations. He said, \u201cNo.\u201d (I get it. He would not admit to such actions anyway, but I had to ask.) But he did tell me that he was very aware of the history of modern-day intelligence and law-enforcement agencies like the FBI and how some black people may be resistant to trusting the bureau\u2019s judgment on Russian collusion.\n\n\n\nIn the end, he feels it is important that people remember that the Kremlin\u2019s actions hurt every American, regardless of race. An attack against America\u2019s electoral process is one of the toughest blows one can inflict. Grant also feels confident that the DIA and FBI he joined in the 2000s aren\u2019t the same as their forebears of the 1960s.\n\nBut if you still have reservations about the investigation, given the intelligence community\u2019s history, Grant understands.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFolks have a right to be skeptical,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re not skeptical, then something is wrong with you.\u201d", "keywords": ["proof", "targeting", "intelligence", "history", "grant", "given", "fbis", "investigation", "russia", "fbi", "russian", "told", "folks", "black", "communities", "trust"], "polarity": 0.0165030850375678, "subjectivity": 0.36226489028213166},

And the NFL our biggest and most popular sports league. But while the NFL\u2019s status as the king of America\u2019s sports hill remains, I don\u2019t remember its position ever being as precarious. To wit, each of the biggest NFL-related stories of the year has been extremely unflattering to the league.\n\nThere\u2019s all of the Colin Kaepernick-related stories (the protests, the reactions from the fans and the front offices and the freakin president to the protests, the boycotts, and the possible collusion to blackball him). And, then, the action on the field has been overshadowed by the conversations about what the action on the field is doing to the brains and bodies of the players.\n\nThe NFL\u2019s ratings have reflected this, falling 9.7 percent this year after falling 8 percent last year\u2014a dip that was then attributed to the election. This decline has led to a $300 million drop in ad revenue. Which, for a multibillion-dollar behemoth, isn\u2019t the end of the world. I doubt anyone in the league\u2019s front office is panicking. But I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the whiskeys they order at their pre-Super Bowl meetings and parties this weekend were doubles.\n\nNaturally, there are myriad possible reasons for this decline in viewership. Most notable is the fact that there are just too many things to watch and too many ways to consume media. People are just doing other things.\n\nIt is interesting, though, that a week before the Super Bowl\u2014the biggest sports and television event of the year\u2014the stories dominating the national sports conversation have nothing to do with the NFL. Instead, we\u2019re discussing, debating and arguing about a draft. A draft for the NBA All-Star Game. A draft that wasn\u2019t even televised. A motherfucking conference call. A Skype conversation between LeBron James and Steph Curry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be fair, I\u2019m sure by this time next week (as the actual game nears), the NFL will be back at the center of our public and cultural consciousness. Especially as the country puts our collective psychic powers together to band against Tom Brady and his merry crew of\u201cMAGA\u201d Patriots.\n\nAnd like every other year, there will be Super Bowl parties, where many people will be only tangentially interested in the actual game.

General Michael T. Flynn (Ret.) After over 33 years of military service to our country, including nearly five years in combat away from my family, and then my decision to continue to serve the United States, it has been extraordinarily painful to endure these many months of false accusations of \u201ctreason\u201d and other outrageous acts. Such false accusations are contrary to everything I have ever done and stood for.

My guilty plea and agreement to cooperate with the Special Counsel\u2019s Office reflect a decision I made in the best interest of my family and of our country. I accept full responsibility for my actions.\n\nYes, he did invoke his military service and his faith in God.\n\nClearly, former FBI Director James Comey was not going to let that slide, because he sent out the most epic subtweet, complete with biblical-Scripture quote:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd the accompanying Instagram post shows us just how deep Comey\u2019s petty runs:\n\nAs has been said many times this morning already, this finna be good.\n\nEarlier:\n\nMichael Flynn, the former national security adviser to Donald Trump, pleaded guilty Friday to charges of lying to the FBI about conversations he had with the Russian ambassador last December during the presidential transition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe New York Times reports that Flynn made an appearance in a federal court in Washington, D.C., as part of a plea deal that inches special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election just a bit closer to Donald Trump\u2019s inner circle.\n\nFlynn lasted only 24 days as national security adviser before being forced to resign after it was revealed that he had lied to Vice President Mike Pence about his conversations with Russian officials during the presidential transition.\n\nSo did he really lie to Pence, or was Pence also complicit? Is Jared Kushner now dangling in the wind? Could Flynn be preparing to testify against the president himself?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe charges Flynn pleaded guilty to Friday morning amount to a veritable slap on the wrist in comparison with all the evidence stacked against him, and they are nothing compared with the charges faced by another Trump associate, Paul Manafort.\n\nManafort was charged with conspiracy against the United States, to which he pleaded not guilty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo the question is, with Flynn pleading guilty to this light-as-a-feather charge, what is he getting\u2014and giving\u2014in exchange?\n\nThere is no way Mueller is granting plea deals for small fish. Flynn has to be dropping the goods on someone big\u2014maybe more than one someone.\n\nThis is also a clear indication that Mueller\u2019s team was able to flip Flynn, but not Manafort. Manafort took his lumps, pleaded not guilty to the charges and now waits to see what happens next.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFlynn, on the other hand, was apparently as nervous as a sow at a North Carolina pig-pulling when it became clear that the investigators would stop at nothing to get to the dirt, even if it meant taking his son Michael G.

I was in the Post newsroom when Jayson Blair was pushing out fake pieces for the New York Times about the Washington, D.C., sniper, and Post brass were going nuts believing that an out-of-town reporter was beating them in their own backyard.\n\nIt was Post reporters and editors who steadied the ship and assured the higher-ups that the stories Blair was producing weren\u2019t where their reporting was leading them. Those reporters and editors worked long hours, stayed later and came in on days off to make sure that everything put into print was right.\n\n\n\nSince taking office, President Donald Trump has been tireless in his attack on the media. He\u2019s called the media and the stories they\u2019ve produced \u201cfake media\u201d and claimed to be \u201cfailing\u201d any news outlet that pens a piece he doesn\u2019t find flattering about him or his administration. I can\u2019t speak for all journalists, but I can say that the people I know at the Washington Post and the institution itself don\u2019t take kindly to this presidential bashing of who they are and what they represent. To date, the Post is the only newspaper in the country that has taken down a president, and I can assure you that those reporters covering the White House would love nothing more than to do it again.\n\nLate Thursday, the Post released a scathing report that not only are Trump and his team trying to undercut special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation, but they are also literally Googling for whom Trump can issue pardons and how.\n\nI\u2019m not sure how The Root got this photo, but we have actual footage of Trump Googling \u201cpardons\u201d:\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Washington Post story notes that Mueller is looking deep into the Russia rabbit hole and wants all of it: Trump\u2019s taxes, Trump\u2019s business associates, his dealings with and in Russia. He wants to lay to rest the claims that Trump and/or members of his Cabinet colluded with Russia. The obvious question here is, if Trump has nothing to hide, then why is he so bothered by Mueller\u2019s investigation?\n\nThose of us who didn\u2019t vote for this large orange mass of hate know the answer in full: Trump and Russia are fucking! Like a spouse who\u2019s been cheated on, non-Trump Americans know full well when something doesn\u2019t smell right. We know that when Trump started staying late after work and trying to lose weight, he was dating Russia. We know that when Trump got a second credit card that didn\u2019t have our name on it, he was meeting Russia at a hotel downtown. We know what cheating looks like.\n\nBut make no mistake about it: Trump has brought this on himself with his boisterous tweets and his \u201cI don\u2019t have a care\u201d attitude. The walls are closing in on this wasted administration, and hopefully we can get this marriage annulled because we haven\u2019t been together that long.

The prosecutor said that the officer believed he was firing high enough that he would miss Kodi if he was standing next to his mother.\n\nRuckle then placed the blame on Gaines for her son getting shot by saying that she allowed him to stand near her while she was holding a gun.\n\n\u201cWhat parent puts their kid in front of a shotgun?

His tough stance against the Soviet Union\u2019s expansionism and his efforts to support anti-Soviet movements in former communist-bloc states helped lead to the USSR\u2019s fall in 1991. His \u201cTear down this wall\u201d speech at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin on June 12, 1987, is remembered for its symbolism and defiance as well as Reagan\u2019s robust behind-the-scenes diplomacy. (Of course, Reagan\u2019s other policies in general were horrible, but that is another story.)\n\nRepublicans today herald Reagan as the guardian who stood up against Soviet aggression and a symbol of the Republican Party\u2019s hawkish foreign policy against Moscow. But it is obvious that the reputation Reagan cultivated for his party is under threat by Donald Trump, a Republican president who many believe is in cahoots with the Kremlin. Not only is there a special investigation into whether Trump\u2019s campaign colluded with Russia to win the 2016 presidential election, but Trump\u2019s attempts to cozy up to Vladimir Putin are doing little to ease those concerns.\n\nBefore and during his campaign for president, Trump lamented that former President Barack Obama was weak on Russia\u2019s aggression in Ukraine and Syria. During a videoconference call to a high-profile annual conference in Kiev, Ukraine, in September of 2015, Trump said, \u201cOur president is not strong\u2014so far all we have is lip service,\u201d adding, \u201cPart of the problem that Ukraine has with the United States is that Putin does not respect our president whatsoever.\u201d In 2016, Trump tweeted about Obama\u2019s lack of strength against Russia over Ukraine.\n\nInterestingly, though, Trump has essentially failed to stand up to Russia\u2019s meddling in European elections or, for that matter, our own elections. Trump\u2019s lack of enthusiasm for blasting the Kremlin is obvious\u2014I mean, Putin helped him win the White House\u2014but that should not stop Republicans from attacking Trump with the same zeal as they did Obama\u2014if, of course, they really are Russia hawks.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), one of Obama\u2019s sharpest critics, wrote in the National Review that Obama needed to reverse his \u201cpolicy of weakness\u201d against Russia over Syria. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said in April 2014 that Obama\u2019s refusal to grant Ukraine critical defensive weapons was \u201canother sign of weakness\u201d in Putin\u2019s eyes. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told CNN that Obama was \u201cweak and indecisive.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFast-forward several years later, and we have Trump, who has yet to grant Ukraine defensive weapons, failing to punish Russia for arguably the greatest attack against U.S. democracy in American history or criticize Putin for what many human rights organizations say is Russia\u2019s bombing of civilian targets in Syria.\n\nThe lack of criticism from the Republican Party for Trump\u2019s handling of Russian aggression is just as apparent. There was plenty of room to criticize Obama for his response to Putin\u2019s geopolitical chess match in Europe and elsewhere, but Trump? Not so much.\n\nSure, he is the GOP\u2019s president, but does party loyalty rank higher than allowing Trump to stand down against Putin\u2019s geopolitical aggression, which has only intensified over the past year? That appears to be the case. Has McCain, Rubio or Graham called Trump weak even once? I Googled and actually found Russian officials calling Trump \u201cweak.\u201d Ironic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nObama\u2019s stance against Russia may have been slow, and his understanding of Moscow\u2019s motives may have left much to be desired, but in light of the Trump campaign\u2019s possible collusion with the Kremlin, Obama, comparatively speaking, looks like the real hawk.\n\nObama\u2019s economic sanctions helped force Russia\u2019s economy to contract by 3.7 percent in 2015. In addition, key drilling projects were forced to shut down as a result. Naturally, Ukraine and U.S. Russia hawks wanted more, but the devastating impact of the Obama administration\u2019s action was hardly weak.\n\nOn the other hand, the Republican response to the Russian collusion scandal has been very weak. When then-acting U.S. Attorney General Sally Yates and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper testified in May that ex-national security adviser Mike Flynn may have been compromised by Russia, GOP senators were more concerned about who leaked the story to the media than gathering information about Flynn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRepublicans also pushed back against former FBI Director James Comey during his June testimony when he said Trump fired him because of his handling of the Russia investigation. House Speaker Paul Ryan brushed off Comey\u2019s claims by saying Trump was \u201cjust new to this\u201d and didn\u2019t understand protocol.\n\nI doubt Obama would have been afforded the same pass, especially since McCain once said during a 2008 debate that the presidency doesn\u2019t allow time for \u201con-the-job training.\u201d\n\nToday\u2019s Republicans are showing their true colors. They do not care about defending America against Moscow. During the presidential campaign, the GOP cared about votes, something that was obvious from Trump\u2019s base, which clearly didn\u2019t care about Russian meddling as long as it helped Hillary Clinton lose.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne Trump supporter told the New York Times, \u201cIf that\u2019s what it took, I\u2019m glad they did it.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, American democracy is being taken to the sunken place by a Congress and a White House full of doves.", "keywords": ["making", "republican", "ukraine", "president", "gop", "fake", "russias", "look", "russia", "hawks", "weak", "obama", "russian", "trump", "trumps"], "polarity": 0.020474241594931254, "subjectivity": 0.44415667346701815},

I knew how that was, and the fact that\u2019s what Floyd is, I connected with it immediately.\u201d\n\nFor Pharoah, White Famous is slightly more than \u201cthe story of a black comedian on the underground that gets the chance to cross over to the industry.\u201d He is just as intrigued by Floyd\u2019s battle to \u201cnot lose himself while making himself more relevant in Hollywood.\u201d\n\nIn the pilot, in which Jamie Foxx makes an appearance, Floyd is confronted with wearing a dress\u2014a common Hollywood trope, especially for black men\u2014for a lucrative career-boosting film role. Like Floyd, Pharoah also refuses to wear a dress. \u201cHave I ever worn a dress?\u201d he quips, shooting the question back. Then he vows, \u201cYou\u2019re not going to see me doing that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFloyd\u2019s determination to achieve fame on his own terms is one of his most appealing features, says Pharoah. \u201cThe fact that he didn\u2019t want to give up on his moral code and standing, I thought that that was fantastic, and I feel the same way,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like you have to sell out to make it. I feel like talent is talent, and talent will transcend what anybody says. It will transcend politics. It breaks through. Talent always breaks through.\u201d\n\nFar from being alone in his journey, Floyd has a son, Trevor (Lonnie Chavis), whom he co-parents with his longtime love Sadie (Cleopatra Coleman), with whom he has a friendly, in-flux relationship. Then there\u2019s his Indian agent, Malcolm (Utkarsh Ambudkar), who is determined to make him a star, even when Floyd doesn\u2019t see the vision; and his friend, roommate and unofficial life and career coach Ron Balls (Jacob Ming-Trent), who filters through his projects and keeps it real with him.\n\n\n\nThe relationship Pharoah and Coleman display on-screen is one of his proudest. \u201cYou got some people who are actually working together, not fighting. [They] have a child, but they\u2019re both putting in the hard work to do what they need to do so he is raised in a loving environment,\u201d he explains.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMore television should be like that,\u201d he continues. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to perpetuate negative stereotypes. There\u2019s no need for that when you can find a smart way to tackle a relationship. It could be good, it could be bad, but at the end of the day, when two responsible parties actually step up and they do take care and handle their business\u2014and, by \u2018business,\u2019 I mean a child\u2014it speaks multitudes about two people in a relationship that are constantly fighting back and forth, and the child doesn\u2019t know where to go, feel me? I feel like the show does a real good job of showing that.\u201d\n\nDoing the show definitely made him appreciate his time on NBC\u2019s iconic sketch-comedy show even more. \u201cSNL is comedy boot camp. That place prepares you for everything,\u201d he says. \u201cI think that\u2019s why I fell into my lead character so well, just because of the quickness that you have to have to adapt to certain things [on SNL]. I got that training from being over there so I\u2019m grateful.\u201d\n\n\n\nHaving Foxx, whom Pharoah has known since 2012, behind White Famous is very comforting, he admits. \u201cJamie Foxx has been nothing but a big brother to me. Honest to God,\u201d he explains. \u201c[To have] somebody who\u2019s established, who is kind of on the same frequency\u2014not saying that we\u2019re equal, but just as far as the talents: being able to do music, being able to do comedy, being able to act\u2014to have somebody who\u2019s like that who\u2019s backing you, who you kind of feel like y\u2019all got a similar vibe, it\u2019s really dope and it does comfort you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAnd it just lets you know,\u201d he adds, \u201cyou\u2019re doing exactly what you need to do, and you\u2019re exactly where you need to be.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhite Famous premieres with two episodes on Sunday at 10 p.m. Eastern time on Showtime.\n\n", "keywords": ["youre", "foxx", "relationship", "ready", "famous", "pharoah", "talent", "jay", "floyd", "snl", "know", "white", "need", "alum", "showtime", "feel"], "polarity": 0.1997642238713667, "subjectivity": 0.496345856524428},

It is communal, emotive and performative, as black people are wont to be, and much the same the world over. After news of the death spreads, people pour out of their homes to a common area\u2014a park, or to the place where the blood has dried.\n\n\n\nThey weep. Tell stories. Laugh. Smash bottles. Drink bottles. Pour out some liquor and get loud. They light candles, offer teddy bears, photos and prayers. Get louder. It is a catharsis of the first kind, a loosening of our deepest emotions, just to get by.\n\nWhen the police do the killing, there is a palpable anger and tension. There is a visceral heartbreak, especially when the death feels tragically unfair. When police kill a young person, a kid you see every day, there are never answers; there is no reprieve. The hand-wringing sorrow stays trapped in alleys and bodies. It is exacerbated by cops and their unions who smear these young victims to justify their mistakes, their deadly prejudice, their ever-present violence.\n\nThe chaotic presidency of Donald Trump may have shifted the lens from the police violence that once dominated headlines, but unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t stop. It never stops. Nor does it prevent the collective trauma of a community reeling with grief and frustration in the aftermath\u2014a trauma that one Los Angeles community is reckoning with after another one of its sons was stolen, swiftly and irrevocably.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Feb. 4, Super Bowl Sunday, dozens of residents of one community in the Westmont neighborhood of South Los Angeles poured out into the 80-degree heat to decry the shooting death of 16-year-old Anthony \u201cA.J.\u201d Weber. He was killed by a member of the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department.\n\n\n\nAnthony was reportedly outside with his neighbors celebrating the Philadelphia Eagles\u2019 win when, police say, he matched the description of a man wielding a gun in the neighborhood. Although details are sketchy, the LASD says that deputies confronted Anthony, saw a weapon, gave chase and shot him after he turned toward them.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs it now stands, no one knows if A.J. was shot in the back; no one knows how many bullets penetrated his young body. No one even knows the names of the officers involved (The Root has reached out repeatedly to the LASD since last week, to no avail). The Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department, notoriously secretive about any investigation involving an \u201cofficer-involved shooting,\u201d has not released much information, and the information it did release raises more questions than answers.\n\n\n\nThe day after Anthony was shot, the LASD convened a press conference that barred activists and members of the community; there, the police played an \u201cedited\u201d version of the 911 call that described a \u201ccall for service\u201d that described a black man in a black shirt and blue jeans, with a black handgun, about 20 years old. Police contend that this was Anthony Weber.\n\n\n\nDuring the press conference, though authorities couldn\u2019t release Anthony\u2019s name because he was a juvenile, Sheriff\u2019s Capt. Chris Bergner was sure to note that A.J. was \u201ca local gang member in the area,\u201d something his father vehemently denies. The captain went on to say that after A.J. was shot, 30 to 40 people from the neighborhood overwhelmed police and took the alleged weapon, and he referred to the area as a \u201chigh violent-crime area,\u201d what the Los Angeles Times called \u201cdeath alley.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCommunity activist and Black Lives Matter Los Angeles member Melina Abdullah calls the police version of the scenario \u201chighly unlikely,\u201d and said that one of her biggest concerns is how this extrajudicial killing affects not only Anthony\u2019s family but also an entire neighborhood.\n\n\u201cWe have to remind people that we\u2019re not subjects, we\u2019re people. We\u2019re entitled to our humanity.\u201d \u2014Melina Abdullah, BLMLA\n\n\u201cFirst they assassinate the body, and then they assassinate the character,\u201d said Abdullah. \u201cAnd so [LASD] is alleging that [Anthony\u2019s] a gang member, that he had a gun. But they\u2019re not listing the fact that this is a 16-year-old child, who the entire community saw all day long, walking around the neighborhood with no shirt on.\u201d\n\n\n\nAbdullah says that she got on the scene about an hour after Anthony was killed, and was disgusted at how the police continued to reinforce pain on an already distraught community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo when we got there, they had at least two city blocks completely cordoned off. There had to be at least 30 officers standing at the line, with billy clubs out,\u201d she recounted, saying that she stood outside the cordoned-off area with a pair of sisters, 12 and 13 years old, who kept saying that they wanted to get home to their mother.\n\n\u201cThis is also community trauma,\u201d said Abdullah. \u201cWe were out there with those little girls until 3 a.m.\u201d\n\nMembers of the Westmont community report that one of A.J.\u2019s brothers (he comes from a family of 10 siblings) was arrested for having a breakdown on the scene. Other witnesses say that A.J.\u2019s father was just aimlessly wandering the street, \u201cout of his head\u201d and talking with people just following behind him at a distance because they didn\u2019t know what to do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrisha Michael, a Black Lives Matter Los Angeles member who has lived in the neighborhood for three years, said that her entire family has been floored by Anthony\u2019s death. Michael said that she has tried to be there for the family because she can sympathize. Her sister was killed by Inglewood, Calif., police two years ago. She helps her mother raise her sister\u2019s sons.\n\n\u201cA.J. ... used to be in front of my house, and my daughter knows him very well. She told me he used to pull up and say, \u2018Be careful in the neighborhood, It\u2019s a lot going on,\u2019 or \u2018Be in the house at such and such time because it\u2019s getting dark early,\u2019\u201d said Michael. \u201cI\u2019m sad, my kids are sad, my nephews knew who he was. I mean, we all live on the same block.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichael continued, clear that she wants to focus on A.J.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not about me; it\u2019s about a 16-year-old kid,\u201d she said emphatically. \u201cIt just brings me back to my situation, you know? It takes me all the way back to these kids, and how these kids are feeling about A.J. getting killed at such a young age. And the amount of times he got shot; their mama got shot 13 times. They just were hurt.\u201d\n\nDr. Imani J. Walker, a psychiatrist and mental health advocate, says that the grieving process for a community inundated by violence, especially at the hands of police, is ongoing.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen a community such as this one is so justifiably upset by the death of a child at the hands of police, the grieving process often doesn\u2019t get time to be fully completed,\u201d Walker explained. \u201cYou\u2019ll have a large group of people going through each stage [of grief] at their own pace. [What] this effectively creates are people who may be at this stage of anger while someone else may be at the stage of depression. So in effect, there are members of the community at various stages who are all pulling each other back into earlier stages of grief. All of these confused emotions generally lead towards feelings of anger and mistrust of their surroundings.\u201d\n\nShe adds, \u201cShared trauma within an affected community can linger for several years, especially if resources are not in place to immediately help manage the feelings generated by the traumatic event. This can cause an affected community to experience not only symptoms of PTSD but depression and anxiety for years to come.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe community is taking it hard right now. The community don\u2019t know where to go, how to go,\u201d said Michael. \u201cThis community is so used to police invading, instead of [...] working with us, or talking to us instead of targeting young black men in so-called dangerous neighborhoods.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYes, I do feel like A.J. was profiled,\u201d Michael continued. \u201cEverybody is not a fucking suspect. You better know who and what. Because my daughter is standing there, she\u2019s 5 feet away from a suspect. What the fuck you gonna do, shoot her, too, because she\u2019s next to him?\u201d\n\n\u201cOur neighborhoods sometimes become like reservations,\u201d conceded Abdullah. \u201cLike, they put us on these little, impoverished tracts of land and try to impose rules that are not laws and treat us like colonial subjects. Saying that 16-year-olds and children don\u2019t have the right to celebrate the Super Bowl if they live in a poor black neighborhood. But we have to remind people that we\u2019re not subjects, we\u2019re people.

On Monday, prosecutors finally announced that three jail staffers will be facing criminal charges in the death.\n\n\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, jail Supervisor Kashka Meadors and jail Deputy James Lee Ramsey-Guy are both charged with neglect of a resident of a penal facility, which is a felony punishable by up to three-and-a-half years in prison. Meanwhile, jail Cmdr. Nancy Lee Evans is charged with felony misconduct and misdemeanor obstructing an office.\n\nProsecutors claim that it was Meadors who ordered Ramsey-Guy to shut off Thomas\u2019 water, while Evans, who could be facing more than four years in prison, was the one who failed to keep surveillance footage showing the water turned off, and then lied to police about what that footage showed.\n\nAccording to the report, investigators asked Evans in a questionnaire if there was any documentation showing whether the water had been turned off the entire time Thomas was incarcerated or intermittently. Evans signed a document claiming that \u201cthere is no documentation indicating this.\u201d Later, prosecutors said that Evans was, in fact, aware that there was a tape showing that the water to Thomas\u2019 cell was turned off and never turned back on again.\n\nThomas, who grappled with bipolar disorder, was denied both water and a mattress for a full week at the jail, which was then run by \u201cBlue Lives Matter\u201d advocate, Donald Trump supporter and all-around windbag Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. Clarke, who was not involved in the inquest because he was not directly involved in the death, has since resigned to join a political action committee in support of Orange Julius.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThomas\u2019 family said that the then-38-year-old was in the midst of a mental crisis when police arrested him on April 14, 2016, for shooting a man in front of his parents\u2019 home and then later firing a gun inside a casino.\n\n\u201cOur expectation when Mr. Thomas was brought into custody was that he would be kept safe. The allegations set forth in the criminal complaint document that that did not happen,\u201d District Attorney John Chisholm said.\n\nProsecutors further presented jurors with jail logs showing that this was not the first time an inmate at that jail had been punished through water deprivation. Logs show two cases in which inmates had water to their cells turned off, both occurring within a month of Thomas\u2019 death. One incident actually occurred a week after Thomas\u2019 death.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterim Sheriff Richard Schmidt told AP that the three staffers who have been charged were suspended Monday, and signaled that he would announce by Friday whether further discipline is needed, after his office conducts a separate investigation.\n\n\u201cMy heart bleeds for these people,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cI\u2019m a human being, I have family members.

That\u2019s when the law-enforcement-adjacent officer decided that he needed to act quickly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAs they were walking, the student became noncompliant on two separate occasions and made an attempt to free herself by pulling away from the officer,\u201d said Vasquez. \u201cTo prevent the student from escaping, the officer forced the student to the ground.\u201d\n\nThe officer reflected on the carnage of recent pepper-spray attacks like the Las Vegas Pepper Spray Attack, often called the largest mass peppering in U.S. history, when a woman pepper-sprayed four guys outside Circus Circus trying to hand out flyers for the Bunny Ranch.\n\nIn the La Mesa case, the quick-thinking policeman decided to defuse the issue with an MMA-style body slam of an already handcuffed 17-year-old girl.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe threw her entire body over his shoulder and then pinned her to the ground using his knees. The friendly officer admirably refrained from punching or kicking the teenager as bystanders caught the act of heroism on video.\n\nTo be fair, some people, like Aeiramique Blake, spoke on behalf of the girl\u2019s family, who are calling the incident an act of police brutality.

Although I survived, I was paralyzed and, soon thereafter, charged with aggravated assault and resisting arrest, charges that were thrown out three years later.\n\n\n\nSince that fateful incident, which began as a \u201croutine\u201d traffic stop, I\u2019ve chosen to use my platform as an activist and a motivational speaker to promote greater police accountability, and to call for an end to racist policing practices that continue to keep black and brown communities under siege.\n\n\n\nThis is one of many reasons that I find Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 latest dog-whistling to be so alarming.\n\n\n\nThis week, Sessions spoke before a meeting at the National Sheriffs\u2019 Association, where he praised the office\u2019s \u201cAnglo-American heritage.\u201d His remarks were a thinly veiled reference to law enforcement\u2019s well-documented and persisting link to the Ku Klux Klan and its history of suppressing black Americans and other people of color through physical and systemic violence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe deeply problematic context behind his words was best summed up in a tweet sent out later that morning by Bernice King, daughter of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King, who vocally opposed Sessions\u2019 judgeship back in 1986.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nPredictably, a Department of Justice spokesperson attempted to convince the public otherwise, saying that Sessions was merely using an antiquated legal term used by lawyers and legal scholars. Perhaps that explanation would have flown if Sessions\u2019 comments were not the latest in a long string of examples demonstrating his use of the attorney general\u2019s office to promote a white supremacist agenda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, Sessions\u2019 mention of Anglo-Americanism as separate from other aspects of American heritage was obviously intended to celebrate only white sheriffs and police officers.\n\n\n\nThe auspicious timing of Sessions\u2019 remarks is also telling. Just last week, Mapping Police Violence and Boston University published new data highlighting the connection between structural racism and racial disparities in fatal police shootings. Key findings from the first-of-its-kind study show that:\n\nOf 1,147 people killed by police in the U.S. in 2017, 25 percent, or 282 people, were black, despite making up only 13 percent of the population.\n\n30 percent of black people killed by police in 2015 were unarmed, compared with 21 percent of white victims.\n\nA strong association was found between the racial disparity in fatal police shootings of unarmed people and structural racism in states.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis data drives home the inherent truth behind Sessions\u2019 speech: Black and brown communities are being disproportionately targeted and killed because America\u2019s justice system continues to be governed by people with a vast lineage of racial subjugation and violence. The attorney general\u2019s comments only reinforce the dangerous notion that law enforcement is bound not just by duty but also by racial and ethnic heritage to exert power in any way it sees fit, while using racial profiling, intimidation and abuse as its tried-and-true policing tools.\n\n\n\nThis is the legacy that allows structural inequities to persist, and for cases like mine and countless others across the country to happen. Despite Sessions\u2019 romanticized interpretation of history, racism and white supremacy are firmly baked in our nation\u2019s DNA. To accomplish real, lasting transformation of our deeply flawed criminal-justice system, other lawmakers and the whole of society must meet this hard truth head-on and break all ties with the torchbearers of America\u2019s racist past.\n\n\n\nLeon Ford is a police-violence survivor, activist and author of the forthcoming book Untold.

It is communal, emotive and performative, as black people are wont to be, and much the same the world over. After news of the death spreads, people pour out of their homes to a common area\u2014a park, or to the place where the blood has dried.\n\n\n\nThey weep. Tell stories. Laugh. Smash bottles. Drink bottles. Pour out some liquor and get loud. They light candles, offer teddy bears, photos and prayers. Get louder. It is a catharsis of the first kind, a loosening of our deepest emotions, just to get by.\n\nWhen the police do the killing, there is a palpable anger and tension. There is a visceral heartbreak, especially when the death feels tragically unfair. When police kill a young person, a kid you see every day, there are never answers; there is no reprieve. The hand-wringing sorrow stays trapped in alleys and bodies. It is exacerbated by cops and their unions who smear these young victims to justify their mistakes, their deadly prejudice, their ever-present violence.\n\nThe chaotic presidency of Donald Trump may have shifted the lens from the police violence that once dominated headlines, but unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t stop. It never stops. Nor does it prevent the collective trauma of a community reeling with grief and frustration in the aftermath\u2014a trauma that one Los Angeles community is reckoning with after another one of its sons was stolen, swiftly and irrevocably.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Feb. 4, Super Bowl Sunday, dozens of residents of one community in the Westmont neighborhood of South Los Angeles poured out into the 80-degree heat to decry the shooting death of 16-year-old Anthony \u201cA.J.\u201d Weber. He was killed by a member of the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department.\n\n\n\nAnthony was reportedly outside with his neighbors celebrating the Philadelphia Eagles\u2019 win when, police say, he matched the description of a man wielding a gun in the neighborhood. Although details are sketchy, the LASD says that deputies confronted Anthony, saw a weapon, gave chase and shot him after he turned toward them.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs it now stands, no one knows if A.J. was shot in the back; no one knows how many bullets penetrated his young body. No one even knows the names of the officers involved (The Root has reached out repeatedly to the LASD since last week, to no avail). The Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department, notoriously secretive about any investigation involving an \u201cofficer-involved shooting,\u201d has not released much information, and the information it did release raises more questions than answers.\n\n\n\nThe day after Anthony was shot, the LASD convened a press conference that barred activists and members of the community; there, the police played an \u201cedited\u201d version of the 911 call that described a \u201ccall for service\u201d that described a black man in a black shirt and blue jeans, with a black handgun, about 20 years old. Police contend that this was Anthony Weber.\n\n\n\nDuring the press conference, though authorities couldn\u2019t release Anthony\u2019s name because he was a juvenile, Sheriff\u2019s Capt. Chris Bergner was sure to note that A.J. was \u201ca local gang member in the area,\u201d something his father vehemently denies. The captain went on to say that after A.J. was shot, 30 to 40 people from the neighborhood overwhelmed police and took the alleged weapon, and he referred to the area as a \u201chigh violent-crime area,\u201d what the Los Angeles Times called \u201cdeath alley.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCommunity activist and Black Lives Matter Los Angeles member Melina Abdullah calls the police version of the scenario \u201chighly unlikely,\u201d and said that one of her biggest concerns is how this extrajudicial killing affects not only Anthony\u2019s family but also an entire neighborhood.\n\n\u201cWe have to remind people that we\u2019re not subjects, we\u2019re people. We\u2019re entitled to our humanity.\u201d \u2014Melina Abdullah, BLMLA\n\n\u201cFirst they assassinate the body, and then they assassinate the character,\u201d said Abdullah. \u201cAnd so [LASD] is alleging that [Anthony\u2019s] a gang member, that he had a gun. But they\u2019re not listing the fact that this is a 16-year-old child, who the entire community saw all day long, walking around the neighborhood with no shirt on.\u201d\n\n\n\nAbdullah says that she got on the scene about an hour after Anthony was killed, and was disgusted at how the police continued to reinforce pain on an already distraught community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo when we got there, they had at least two city blocks completely cordoned off. There had to be at least 30 officers standing at the line, with billy clubs out,\u201d she recounted, saying that she stood outside the cordoned-off area with a pair of sisters, 12 and 13 years old, who kept saying that they wanted to get home to their mother.\n\n\u201cThis is also community trauma,\u201d said Abdullah. \u201cWe were out there with those little girls until 3 a.m.\u201d\n\nMembers of the Westmont community report that one of A.J.\u2019s brothers (he comes from a family of 10 siblings) was arrested for having a breakdown on the scene. Other witnesses say that A.J.\u2019s father was just aimlessly wandering the street, \u201cout of his head\u201d and talking with people just following behind him at a distance because they didn\u2019t know what to do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrisha Michael, a Black Lives Matter Los Angeles member who has lived in the neighborhood for three years, said that her entire family has been floored by Anthony\u2019s death. Michael said that she has tried to be there for the family because she can sympathize. Her sister was killed by Inglewood, Calif., police two years ago. She helps her mother raise her sister\u2019s sons.\n\n\u201cA.J. ... used to be in front of my house, and my daughter knows him very well. She told me he used to pull up and say, \u2018Be careful in the neighborhood, It\u2019s a lot going on,\u2019 or \u2018Be in the house at such and such time because it\u2019s getting dark early,\u2019\u201d said Michael. \u201cI\u2019m sad, my kids are sad, my nephews knew who he was. I mean, we all live on the same block.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichael continued, clear that she wants to focus on A.J.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not about me; it\u2019s about a 16-year-old kid,\u201d she said emphatically. \u201cIt just brings me back to my situation, you know? It takes me all the way back to these kids, and how these kids are feeling about A.J. getting killed at such a young age. And the amount of times he got shot; their mama got shot 13 times. They just were hurt.\u201d\n\nDr. Imani J. Walker, a psychiatrist and mental health advocate, says that the grieving process for a community inundated by violence, especially at the hands of police, is ongoing.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen a community such as this one is so justifiably upset by the death of a child at the hands of police, the grieving process often doesn\u2019t get time to be fully completed,\u201d Walker explained. \u201cYou\u2019ll have a large group of people going through each stage [of grief] at their own pace. [What] this effectively creates are people who may be at this stage of anger while someone else may be at the stage of depression. So in effect, there are members of the community at various stages who are all pulling each other back into earlier stages of grief. All of these confused emotions generally lead towards feelings of anger and mistrust of their surroundings.\u201d\n\nShe adds, \u201cShared trauma within an affected community can linger for several years, especially if resources are not in place to immediately help manage the feelings generated by the traumatic event. This can cause an affected community to experience not only symptoms of PTSD but depression and anxiety for years to come.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe community is taking it hard right now. The community don\u2019t know where to go, how to go,\u201d said Michael. \u201cThis community is so used to police invading, instead of [...] working with us, or talking to us instead of targeting young black men in so-called dangerous neighborhoods.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYes, I do feel like A.J. was profiled,\u201d Michael continued. \u201cEverybody is not a fucking suspect. You better know who and what. Because my daughter is standing there, she\u2019s 5 feet away from a suspect. What the fuck you gonna do, shoot her, too, because she\u2019s next to him?\u201d\n\n\u201cOur neighborhoods sometimes become like reservations,\u201d conceded Abdullah. \u201cLike, they put us on these little, impoverished tracts of land and try to impose rules that are not laws and treat us like colonial subjects. Saying that 16-year-olds and children don\u2019t have the right to celebrate the Super Bowl if they live in a poor black neighborhood. But we have to remind people that we\u2019re not subjects, we\u2019re people.

On Monday, prosecutors finally announced that three jail staffers will be facing criminal charges in the death.\n\n\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, jail Supervisor Kashka Meadors and jail Deputy James Lee Ramsey-Guy are both charged with neglect of a resident of a penal facility, which is a felony punishable by up to three-and-a-half years in prison. Meanwhile, jail Cmdr. Nancy Lee Evans is charged with felony misconduct and misdemeanor obstructing an office.\n\nProsecutors claim that it was Meadors who ordered Ramsey-Guy to shut off Thomas\u2019 water, while Evans, who could be facing more than four years in prison, was the one who failed to keep surveillance footage showing the water turned off, and then lied to police about what that footage showed.\n\nAccording to the report, investigators asked Evans in a questionnaire if there was any documentation showing whether the water had been turned off the entire time Thomas was incarcerated or intermittently. Evans signed a document claiming that \u201cthere is no documentation indicating this.\u201d Later, prosecutors said that Evans was, in fact, aware that there was a tape showing that the water to Thomas\u2019 cell was turned off and never turned back on again.\n\nThomas, who grappled with bipolar disorder, was denied both water and a mattress for a full week at the jail, which was then run by \u201cBlue Lives Matter\u201d advocate, Donald Trump supporter and all-around windbag Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. Clarke, who was not involved in the inquest because he was not directly involved in the death, has since resigned to join a political action committee in support of Orange Julius.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThomas\u2019 family said that the then-38-year-old was in the midst of a mental crisis when police arrested him on April 14, 2016, for shooting a man in front of his parents\u2019 home and then later firing a gun inside a casino.\n\n\u201cOur expectation when Mr. Thomas was brought into custody was that he would be kept safe. The allegations set forth in the criminal complaint document that that did not happen,\u201d District Attorney John Chisholm said.\n\nProsecutors further presented jurors with jail logs showing that this was not the first time an inmate at that jail had been punished through water deprivation. Logs show two cases in which inmates had water to their cells turned off, both occurring within a month of Thomas\u2019 death.

The grieving family and community had an opportunity to be heard on a national level. An opportunity to say or do what they needed in front of Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department officials, with less of a chance of being threatened, beaten or shot. An opportunity to expose the Sheriff\u2019s Department\u2019s actions for what they are: the coverup and justification of the state-sanctioned murder of a black child.\n\nBut, as usual, in the long history of white-owned media covering black grief, you were there to consume and exploit. To film and take notes the entire time, but only explicitly publish the parts that discredit the community being harmed. To get clicks and likes with buzzwords like \u201cgang member,\u201d \u201cangry mob\u201d and \u201cchaos.\u201d And, most disappointingly, to uplift the narrative put forward by the very people who killed Anthony Weber\u2014members of the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department. A narrative designed to protect them from liability and justify their actions while the murderer is on paid administrative leave.\n\nFor those of us who were present Wednesday night, we know that the Town Hall was not accurately covered. If it had been, the media would be focusing on the fact that Anthony\u2019s father asked why the LASD was able to confidently say on live TV that his son was a gang member and had a gun when that was not true, but when he asks the LASD any questions, its representatives\u2019 reply is, \u201cWe can\u2019t discuss that, since this is an ongoing investigation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy are they able to discuss details that discredit his son on TV during an ongoing investigation with absolutely no evidence to support them?

That is a question that was brought up at the Town Hall and left unanswered by the LASD. Could you, as an investigative reporter, not have researched and reported on that?\n\nHow about when Anthony\u2019s brother asked people in the room to stand if they were there because they cared about Anthony, and everyone stood up except for the LASD representatives? Is that not the kind of controversy that gets clicks and reactions?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow about when Anthony\u2019s brother described how he himself had been handcuffed and put in a police car while his brother was dying on the concrete and the deputies told him, \u201cFuck your brother\u201d\u2014is that not newsworthy?\n\nThere is one part the news media did grasp onto\u2014when the audience got so fed up by not being answered and by being disrespected, they stood up and raised their voices\u2014but you didn\u2019t accurately describe why.

The cameras might encourage positive behavioral change and the video footage might be useful as evidence.\u201d\n\nNot only did D.C. outfit its cops with the technology, but it teamed up with The Lab @ DC, a team of research scientists in D.C.\u2019s Office of the City Administrator, to conduct a \u201crigorous field experiment\u201d to see if the cameras achieved the goals for which they were intended.\n\nBeginning in June 2015, the MPD began randomly issuing cameras to officers.

The boy ran when faced with the police, so they gave chase. During the chase, the police spotted the boy holding a gun, and when he turned, they shot the teenager. The youngster wasn\u2019t critically injured, and it seemed like an open-and-shut case of a justifiable use of force.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow people are wondering.\n\nThe Baltimore Police Department is currently in court over one of the biggest scandals in the history of American law enforcement. The corruption case is replete with intrigue as police reveal secrets that sound like something out of an urban-fiction novel or a lost season of The Wire. It has revealed how one of America\u2019s largest cities just happened to be filled with crooked cops, but no one seems to be talking about it outside of Baltimore.\n\nAccording to the Baltimore Sun, it started when a 19-year-old woman from New Jersey overdosed in 2011 and authorities began tracing the origin of the drugs. It led them to a Baltimore drug crew and the discovery that a Baltimore police officer was involved. By the time they finished investigating, eight members of the elite Gun Trace Task Force had been charged with crimes ranging from racketeering to robbery.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou want robbery? How about the story of the corrupt squad stopping a drug dealer during a traffic stop and robbing him of $6,500, then going to the man\u2019s home without a warrant and taking another $100,000 out of a safe? Sgt. Wayne Jenkins would ask suspected drug dealers, \u201cIf you could put together a crew of guys and rob the biggest drug dealer in town, who would it be?\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in police targeting regular citizens, maybe you should read about how the Maurice Ward had a technique of driving fast at groups of people, slamming on the brakes and chasing whoever ran. Perhaps you hear how Jenkins believed that all young men with backpacks were dope boys. Or people who drove Honda Accords with tinted windows.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the revelation that the supervisor of the unit instructed officers to carry a toy gun just in case they found themselves \u201cin a jam\u201d and needed to plant one. When one of the officers, Marcus Tayor, was arrested, officials couldn\u2019t figure out why he had a toy gun in his glove compartment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese revelations aren\u2019t speculation. Six of the eight indicted officers have agreed to cooperate with federal law enforcement agents and are testifying in open court. An officer who was scheduled to offer evidence against the crooked cops won\u2019t get to do so after he was mysteriously shot in the head with his own weapon the day before he was set to testify.\n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking: After the death of Freddie Gray and the discovery of multiple officers who planted drugs on suspects, the Baltimore Police Department is one of the most corrupt departments in the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOr maybe Baltimore is indicative of police departments all over the country. Maybe they\u2019re like the one in Cleveland, which hired the cop who killed Tamir Rice after he was fired by another police department. Or like the South Carolina state trooper who said he shot a man because he was moving erratically while reaching for his wallet. Or when a paid police informant planted cocaine in a store owner\u2019s shop.\n\nIt is not just Baltimore cops. It is cops. They will shoot you in the face in front of your infant daughter. They will choke you to sleep for selling cigarettes. They will shoot you in the back for walking away.

Activists cited her shooting as yet another example of police officers using excessive force against black people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolice officers showed up to Gaines\u2019 apartment at 9 a.m. that fateful day to serve arrest warrants on her and her fiance.\n\nAssistant County Attorney James S. Ruckle Jr. told the jury that when no one would answer the door, officers kicked it in, and the first officer to enter the apartment was \u201cconfronted with Korryn Gaines with a shotgun pointed right at him.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Gaines\u2019 fiance left the apartment with their infant daughter, she remained behind with their 5-year-old son. Gaines, 23, remained inside her Randallstown apartment with tactical officers stationed in the hallway outside for six hours.\n\nRuby, who would ultimately kill Gaines and injure her young son, was posted just outside her apartment door\u2014which was cracked open.\n\nRuckle claimed that Ruby was in danger because although he was wearing tactical gear, his arms, legs and face were exposed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Ruckle, Ruby decided to fire into the apartment when he saw Gaines and her son go into the kitchen. The prosecutor said that the officer believed he was firing high enough that he would miss Kodi if he was standing next to his mother.\n\nRuckle then placed the blame on Gaines for her son getting shot by saying that she allowed him to stand near her while she was holding a gun.\n\n\u201cWhat parent puts their kid in front of a shotgun? What parent puts their kid in that kind of unsafe position?\u201d he asked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe also blamed Gaines for her own death.\n\n\u201cKorryn Gaines started it.

Shellenberger, who did not file criminal charges against any of the officers involved in the shooting. He also said that Ruby fired at Gaines because she pointed her gun at other officers and fired back, which led Ruby to fire more shots in the kitchen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRavenell, however, said that there was no officer standing in Gaines\u2019 line of fire when Ruby fired the first shot.\n\nLast week Shellenberger said, \u201cI stand by the statements I made in public concerning the outcome of this case. I believe the Baltimore County Police Department did a thorough investigation that allowed me to come to the conclusion that this was a justifiable shooting.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at the Baltimore Sun.", "keywords": ["county", "baltimore", "gaines", "file", "lawsuit", "amended", "officers", "fired", "6yearold", "son", "shot", "kodi", "shooting", "lawyers", "korryn", "ruby", "officer"], "polarity": 0.06434343434343434, "subjectivity": 0.33377777777777773},

On Nov. 19, 2011, he somehow set off his medical device. When an emergency operator tried to talk to Chamberlain through a loudspeaker in his bedroom, he didn\u2019t respond, so she called an ambulance. The White Plains, N.Y., Police Department followed the ambulance to Chamberlain\u2019s home, where he answered the door.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe told the officers that everything was OK, but that wasn\u2019t enough. The medical-device operator personally called the White Plains Police Department to cancel the emergency call, but that wasn\u2019t enough, either. Chamberlain\u2019s niece, who lived downstairs, asked the cops to let her speak to him, but they wouldn\u2019t.\n\nThe cops insisted on coming in, so they tried to break down the door for over an hour. During that hour, the cops yelled at Chamberlain. They screamed for him to open the door. Chamberlain yelled through the door: \u201cI\u2019m a sick old man,\u201d to which Officer Stephen Hart replied, \u201cWe don\u2019t give a fuck, nigger!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen the officers finally broke the door down, they shot the 68-year-old man with a Taser in the neck and abdomen. Then they shot him with a less-than-lethal beanbag from a shotgun. They hit him with a baton. Then one of the officers claimed that a 68-year-old man, who had already been shot with a Taser and a beanbag gun and couldn\u2019t walk 40 feet without wheezing, attacked them with a knife. So the officer shot Kenneth Chamberlain in the chest.\n\nTwice.\n\nFor five months, the police refused to identify the officer who shot Chamberlain. When the name of the officer, Anthony Carelli, was finally identified, he insisted that Chamberlain was going to kill him with the butcher knife he was holding as he charged at the officer. Even after the information came out that Carelli was facing a $10 million lawsuit for beating two brothers and calling them \u201crag heads,\u201d the Police Department, the police union and Carelli stuck with the story. They stuck by the story even when the autopsy showed that Chamberlain wasn\u2019t even facing the officer. They stuck by the story even when the coroner said that Chamberlain couldn\u2019t have been holding a knife. Carelli stuck by his story even after it was proved that Chamberlain\u2019s hands were at his side when he was shot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd Anthony Carelli got away with it.\n\nHe didn\u2019t go to trial. A grand jury refused to indict the officers. A federal jury rejected a civil suit against Carelli and the city of White Plains in 2016 after the judge refused to allow evidence of the racial slurs or Carelli\u2019s past. Now Joon Kim, who replaced U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara when he was fired by President Donald Trump after refusing to resign, has announced that no civil rights charges will be filed, according to the Associated Press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a statement announcing his reasoning for closing the case, Kim said:\n\n\u201cOfficer Carelli believed that Sergeant Martin was in danger of being seriously injured by Mr. Chamberlain. The investigation revealed no evidence to refute Officer Carelli\u2019s testimony that he shot Mr. Chamberlain in response to his belief that Sergeant Martin was in danger of being seriously physically injured by Mr. Chamberlain.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s the Justice Department\u2019s reason for closing the case. Because it is OK to shoot someone as long as\u2014despite all the evidence to the contrary\u2014you believe that he or she poses a danger, you can murder that person in cold blood.

The officer was afraid that the elderly man would hurt himself (or others), so he took it upon himself to hurt him first. Got it.\n\nAccording to the Post and Courier, the man, Albert Chatfield, was still hospitalized and in intensive care as of Friday, four days after his horrific encounter with police in the small town of Kingstree, S.C.\n\nChatfield\u2019s family and their attorney are now demanding answers, particularly surrounding the officer\u2019s use of force\u2014which they call unconstitutional and unnecessary\u2014in his attempts to get Chatfield to safety.\n\n\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t hurt anybody,\u201d Chatfield\u2019s daughter, Jodi Mack, who lives in North Carolina, told the news site. \u201cHe would only make you hurt laughing.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChatfield\u2019s injuries from the encounter were extensive, according to the report.

He was placed in a medically induced coma earlier this week, but when he awoke, he was unable to speak. He only mumbled and cried, according to the Post and Courier.\n\nThe Kingstree Police Department said that Chatfield wouldn\u2019t be charged in the incident (why would he be?!) because of his medical condition. An incident report lists as a potential crime \u201cacting disorderly,\u201d the report notes.\n\nThe officer, who has since been identified as Stephen Sweikata, has only been on the Kingstree force since April, although he worked for two years previously at the Charleston County, S.C., Sheriff\u2019s Office, according to the report.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf you cannot restrain an 86-year-old, you need to eat some spinach,\u201d Bamberg said of the police and his client. \u201cIt\u2019s unconstitutional to tase someone just because they\u2019re not listening. Plus, he\u2019s 86.\u201d\n\nChatfield is a fixture in his community, but in recent years he has been put through the wringer. His health started to decline. He lost his wife. He battled with lung cancer. And then dementia started showing its ugly face.\n\nOn Sunday night, he became confused and called his loved ones, saying that he feared for his safety, the Post and Courier reports. The authorities got involved but assured Mack that her father would be OK until the following day, when she\u2019d be able to travel into town.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat, unfortunately, proved not to be true.\n\nAround 7:45 a.m. Monday, dispatchers got a call from someone who reported a Ford SUV tailgating another vehicle and \u201cnot allowing\u201d the vehicle to turn.\n\nFrom the Post and Courier:\n\nSweikata was patrolling the area and reported seeing a Ford Expedition do a U-turn, as if to escape his police car. When Sweikata turned on his cruiser\u2019s blue lights, he said the Ford pulled a 360-degree turn. The SUV soon ran a red light but stopped at Main and Brooks streets, where Chatfield got out. Sweikata and Lt. Carl Scott, who is black, told him to get on the ground.\n\nAccording to the report, Chatfield did not listen to those orders.\n\n\u201cChatfield ignored all these orders and took up a fighting stance against myself,\u201d Sweikata detailed in an report. \u201cChatfield then started jogging/walking backwards in the lanes of traffic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was when Sweikata, according to his report, decided to deploy his Taser, \u201cbecause traffic was still moving ... and I was afraid that Mr. Chatfield would be struck by a vehicle, had this continued.\u201d\n\nThe probes from the weapon caught Chatfield in his chest and ribs, and he fell to the ground on his back. Officers then rolled him over and handcuffed him before escorting him away. However, nowhere in the report were any injuries described.\n\nChatfield was, however, eventually taken to the McLeod Regional Medical Center.\n\nMack only learned about what happened to her father from an old friend who reported seeing the elderly man get shocked with the Taser, the report notes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at the Post and Courier.", "keywords": ["86yearold", "stop", "vehicle", "taser", "started", "remains", "chatfield", "hurt", "dementia", "care", "suffers", "post", "man", "traffic", "sweikata", "according", "intensive", "report"], "polarity": -0.06099290780141845, "subjectivity": 0.4955673758865248},

Edwards Memorial Endowed Scholarship Fund was conceptualized \u201cto promote the education of deserving undergraduate students who enroll full time at the University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, Alabama.\u201d\n\nAs The Root previously reported, 15-year-old Jordan, two of his brothers and their friends were leaving a house party on April 29, 2017, when Balch Springs, Texas, Police Officer Roy Oliver pointed his rifle at the car full of teens and opened fire, fatally shooting Jordan in the head.\n\nOliver was eventually fired and indicted on murder charges, but not before Balch Springs Police Chief Jonathan Haber attempted to justify Jordan\u2019s extrajudicial killing. Haber initially claimed that the car in which Jordan was traveling was \u201cbacking down the street toward officers in an aggressive manner,\u201d which prompted Oliver to open fire.\n\nHaber later admitted during a press conference that he lied \u201cmisspoke.\u201d \u201cAfter reviewing the video, I don\u2019t believe that [the fatal shooting] met our core values,\u201d Haber said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJordan, a freshman honor student and athlete at Mesquite High School, dreamed of attending the University of Alabama and playing football for the Crimson Tide. Oliver ended those dreams with a single bullet, but Jordan\u2019s legacy will not die.\n\n\u201cThe circumstances of his death could have easily made his mark one of tragedy,\u201d the scholarship\u2019s website reads. \u201cWe will not allow that to be how Jordan is remembered. He was an excellent student, an athlete, a brother, and a son. His mark will be one of opportunity, for a student to become what time and events did not allow to Jordan. ... It will be the duty of the scholarship recipients to carry on a legacy of hope in Jordan\u2019s name, hope for a better, diverse tomorrow.\u201d\n\nWhen Brandon P. Bell, who plays the character Troy in Dear White People, heard Jordan\u2019s story, he connected with the teen on a visceral level and knew that he had to do something.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHonestly, I was motivated by frustration. I\u2019m from Dallas, so I have that connection, but it\u2019s more than that,\u201d Bell said in an interview with The Root.\n\n\u201cI read about Jordan\u2019s story and was on the verge of tears. I knew that I wanted to do something, and I wanted to do it specifically for the family,\u201d Bell said. \u201cSo I reached out to them to see how they wanted to honor Jordan\u2019s legacy, and they wanted to do that through education. Everything started from there.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarque Richardson, who plays Reggie on Dear White People, has been with Bell every step of the way in seeing this scholarship fund come to fruition. He also traveled with Bell to Texas to meet Jordan\u2019s family.\n\n\n\n\u201cUA was Jordan\u2019s dream school, but his life\u2014and the opportunity to realize his dreams\u2014was stolen from him and his family,\u201d Richardson told The Root.\n\nBoth Bell and Richardson said that the scholarship fund was created to give students the opportunity to live out their dreams because Jordan no longer can.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough the scholarship specifies that funds will be awarded to \u201cdeserving students,\u201d Bell made it clear that \u201cdeserving\u201d is about much more than grades and extracurricular activities.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe concept of being deserving is so vast,\u201d Bell said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just about how someone looks on paper, not just their GPA. But do they represent who Jordan was as a person? Do they understand\u2014or are they trying to learn\u2014about the systemic oppression that creates the environment where Jordan\u2019s death can take place?\n\n\u201cThe family created an essay question for the scholarship, and it really reflects the heart of what we\u2019re trying to accomplish,\u201d he continued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRichardson agreed, adding that supporting students and helping them navigate a racist society is critical.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to help pave the way so that our leaders of tomorrow have the tools they need to create the change we need,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cIt\u2019s good to take it to the streets, but we also have to have people in positions to influence policy and legislation, to change the world on an institutional level. That\u2019s what this scholarship is about.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe have to create space for our children to be supported in the fullness of their humanity,\u201d Richardson continued. \u201cWe have to do what we can do to help them reach their goals. They deserve that. This scholarship fund is an entity that will last forever, and it\u2019s one more tool that, at its core, can be used to keep our people alive.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn an interview with The Root, civil rights attorney S. Lee Merritt, who represents the Edwards family, said, \u201cThe murder of Jordan Edwards represented not only a tragic loss to his family, but his death robbed our community of a valuable resource of potential.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis scholarship fund is an ingenious mechanism for beginning to make up for that great loss, but it can\u2019t end here,\u201d Merritt continued. \u201cWe are pushing to get police reform legislation passed in Jordan\u2019s name, a football stadium dedicated to his memory and above all a historical conviction in the Texas Criminal Courts for his murderer, Roy Oliver.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs college costs continue to rise, Bell said that it was also important to him to lift the economic burden from students\u2019 shoulders.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t have done this without the support of the community, cast, and Jordan\u2019s love of life guiding the way,\u201d Bell said. \u201cI have learned that we must rely on each other for support.\u201d\n\nClick here to donate to the Jordan J.

Kelly is going to tear the black community down the seam. There are those who believe the R&B singer is guilty of everything he\u2019s ever been accused of, and not because they are haters of his music but because they\u2019ve seen the videotape of a man who looks like R. Kelly and has a Grammy on his shelf who is molesting and peeing on a child. If that man in said video is not R. Kelly, then this might be the most Hotep shit I\u2019ve ever written, but R. Kelly has a clone.\n\nAnd then there are the others: the Black Deplorables, those who believe with a Trumpian\u2019s faith that because the man gave us \u201cI Believe I Can Fly\u201d and \u201cIgnition (Remix),\u201d and because he wore a Black Israelite headpiece in the \u201cI Wish\u201d video, that the ongoing pedophile allegations against him are fake news\u2014or, even worse, they don\u2019t care.\n\nOn Monday, BuzzFeed dropped a bombshell that the Pied Piper of R&B (vomit-inducing name) was holding women captive. The piece claimed that the family of a woman, who has now been revealed as Jocelyn Savage, believes that Kelly was running a sex cult in which women were not allowed to contact their families. The article also claimed that the singer didn\u2019t allow the women to wear revealing clothing or speak to other men. If you haven\u2019t read it, take time to do so; it\u2019s troubling.\n\nR. Kelly has come out against the allegations and Savage has come forward to tell TMZ that she is, in fact, OK:\n\nThe video was supposed to assure readers of the initial article that Savage was not a member of a cult. The video was supposed to clear R. Kelly\u2019s name, except that Savage totally seems like a captive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m no captive expert. I haven\u2019t reviewed captive videos before, but my layman\u2019s experience tells me that Savage doesn\u2019t seem very forthcoming with information. In fact, one could argue that Savage is being coached off camera.\n\nGo back and watch the footage. When the TMZ interviewer asks Savage why she believes that her family has asked for a welfare check now, Savage starts to answer the question and then looks up off camera and says she doesn\u2019t want to answer the question. She also refuses to answer whether she\u2019s in Georgia, whether she\u2019s living with roommates, and whether she can come and go as she pleases\u2014all questions that a noncaptive would answer freely, one would assume.\n\nInternet sleuths have also reported that a shadow can be seen on Savage\u2019s shirt top, confirming that someone is behind the camera and, thus, coaching Savage through her answers. Savage\u2019s behavior appears, at the least, to be captive-esque.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the bigger question for me is, what does a 50-year-old man with a history of sexually predatory behavior surrounding him like stench off a garbage dump want with a 21-year-old? More importantly, why does he have her around when her family insists that she is being held captive? If you aren\u2019t holding her captive, then why aren\u2019t you encouraging her to visit and call her family?\n\nAlso, WHY IS A 50-YEAR-OLD MAN HOUSING A 21-YEAR-OLD? Why does he have a friendship with a 21-year-old? Why does he have her living in or near him? Why are there several women alleging the same thing? What will it take for young black women\u2019s lives to matter more than a slow jam?\n\nNever forget that during the height of R. Kelly\u2019s alleged pedophilia, interviewer Tour\u00e9 asked him plainly, \u201cDo you like teenage girls?\u201d To which R. Kelly replied, \u201cWhen you say \u2018teenage,\u2019 how old are we talking?\u201d", "keywords": ["r", "clearly", "kelly", "answer", "does", "woman", "young", "video", "women", "talk", "man", "need", "looks", "savage", "captive", "black"], "polarity": 0.05205795496493174, "subjectivity": 0.4754891103728313},

It was fairly windy, so maybe a gust had set off the car alarm, though no sound was coming from the car.\n\nThe car was parked in the driveway of the home, the outdoor Christmas lights were on and I could see that a light on the top floor was on, so I assumed that somebody was home. I thought to myself, \u201cI should hop out of the car and go ring their doorbell and let them know that their car lights are on.\u201d Lord knows, I\u2019d hate to wake up in the morning\u2014it was about 8 p.m. when I saw the car\u2014and find out my car battery was dead because the alarm was going off all night.\n\nI almost pulled up to the house right then, but I decided to drop off my daughter first. Should something go awry, I do not want my daughter there.\n\nShould something go awry.\n\nThat\u2019s literally the first thought that popped into my head. I wanted to let this family know that their car alarm was going off and that they might want to go see about it, and I was worried about what could go wrong.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI dropped off my daughter at her mother\u2019s home, which is farther into the subdivision, so I\u2019d pass the house on my way back out. I told myself that if the alarm was still going off when I drove by again\u2014likely\u2014that I\u2019d get out and go ring their doorbell and let them know. It seemed like such a simple and neighborly thing to do. And here was where all of the true overthinking began.\n\nI pulled up to the side of the house and started to plan how I was going to go about telling them. For one, I had on all black, save for my maroon down jacket, with a black hoodie and black skullcap. It was about 15 degrees outside, so I wasn\u2019t taking any of that off and risking getting myself sick in order to let them know their car lights were blinking.\n\nThen I thought to myself, \u201cIf I go up to this door and ring the doorbell and wait, chances are they\u2019ll turn the light on so they\u2019ll be able to see me, but I\u2019m dressed as I am, and because of the positioning of the garage, they won\u2019t actually be able to see their car from their front door, so they could be suspicious.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo maybe I\u2019ll just go ring the doorbell, walk back to my car quickly hoping that I beat them answering the door, maybe get into my car or stand there, and when they open the door, yell an entire concession speech about how I wanted to let them know about their car but didn\u2019t want to frighten them as a random stranger dressed in all black at their door at 8 p.m. on a really dark street\u201d\u2014seriously, this street needs streetlights in the worst way\u2014\u201cbut didn\u2019t want them to wake up to a car with a dead battery.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t want them to think about having to step outside the door with me there and wondering if I was going to try to force myself into their home, so I walked away from the door.\n\nI was really thinking about saying all of that. Why?\n\nI did not want to end up shot or having the police called on me. Do I know if they had a gun? Or would have answered the door with one? No, I don\u2019t. But do I know that they wouldn\u2019t have? Nope. They didn\u2019t know me, and I didn\u2019t know them and it was dark outside and late enough to wonder who would be stopping by the house unannounced.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI literally had all of these thoughts as I sat there and tried to strategize how to do them a solid and put myself in the least amount of harm\u2019s way.\n\nAnd you know what I did? I drove off. I felt bad for driving off. But I also felt like I had to think too hard on how best to make them feel comfortable as I tried to help them out, and how my trying to be nice required me to consider so many factors about myself and how I would present at the door.\n\nIt\u2019s ENTIRELY possible that I totally overthought the whole thing. Maybe I watch too much television or read too much\u2014a police officer told me that once when he pulled me over and I very slowly and deliberately told him what I was doing as I grabbed my wallet. I was pissed that he\u2019d mocked me when I was trying to make sure I made it home safely and he didn\u2019t shoot anybody that night because he feared for his life over a taillight in front of Washington, D.C.\u2019s Union Station.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI recognize there was a time when I wouldn\u2019t have thought twice about walking up to somebody\u2019s door, and if it had been summer and more well-lit outside, I would have without a second thought. But I\u2019ve read too many stories of trivial encounters gone all the way wrong. And I could see all the ways it could have happened in the few minutes I sat there pondering how I\u2019d do this. And it wasn\u2019t lost on me that, ultimately, I had to strategize a good deed so that this one did not go punished.\n\nUnder different circumstances, I\u2019d absolutely walk up to a door and alert somebody. I\u2019ve done it before. I\u2019ve done it in my own neighborhood\u2014one where I\u2019d think people would be more hyperaware of people coming to their door.\n\nChances are, even last night, nothing would have happened to me. I\u2019d have let them know, they\u2019d have checked out their car, thanked me and turned off the alarm, and we\u2019d all have gone about our lives. But I just don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know who lived there or what they\u2019ve gone through in life. Or what they\u2019ve seen. Or if it was a cop who is always on high alert, or whatever.

Black Lightning is a (retired) black superhero operating outside the law. Of course he\u2019s had run-ins with the police.\n\nBlack Lightning\u2019s issues with law enforcement don\u2019t stop when he takes off his costume and becomes school principal Jefferson Pierce\u2014something that Black Lightning showrunner and executive proper Salim Akil wanted to make readily apparent in the series\u2019 first episode.

Recently launched by Oronike Odeleye and Kenyette Barnes, the campaign\u2019s intent is to finally shove R. Kelly out of the music industry because of a long history of abuse, from past allegations of pedophilia, sexual assault, and battery to newer, equally disturbing accusations of violence. Williams herself has long reported on R. Kelly\u2019s misdeeds throughout the years and has never shied away from expressing her disdain of the singer, so one would assume she would align with such a crusade.\n\nHowever, when the campaign was discussed during her Hot Topics segment, Williams was rather dismissive. \u201cWhat is this, 10 years too late?\u201d Williams told the audience. \u201cIt\u2019s not gonna work. Black people aren\u2019t really good at protesting. Not since the King march.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a fan of the show, I have learned to build a high tolerance for opinions that ought to be soaked in bleach and left to air-dry near a Google search bar. Amnesia about recent political movements like Black Lives Matter notwithstanding, #MuteRKelly can already claim success after reportedly inspiring the cancellation of six of Kelly\u2019s concerts in eight cities. As #MeToo creator Tarana Burke explained on a recent episode of Comedy Central\u2019s The Opposition with Jordan Keppler about Kelly: \u201cJust like the Harvey Weinsteins of the world, he\u2019s a sexual predator, and he\u2019s been preying on black and brown girls for 20 years.\u201d\n\nMany of R. Kelly\u2019s detractors have complained year after year about his continued success and adulation in the face of such history\u2014largely because of the type of victims he\u2019s chosen, but also because of the times in which he\u2019s lived. In just a few months, the world has changed: We are a far cry from the days when R. Kelly could marry a teenage Aaliyah without a public fuss. #MuteRKelly is an attempt to right these wrongs.\n\nIt is black women doing that we all should be doing. So it should not be undermined by, of all people, another black woman. And Williams is not the only famous black woman still excusing him\u2014or even publicly exalting him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are not one, but three photos currently on Lil\u2019 Kim\u2019s Instagram account of her in the studio with R. Kelly. She appears giddy, but many of her fans are rightfully frustrated. \u201cHe\u2019s a pedophile. How could anyone work with him?\u201d one user asks. Another writes, \u201cWait are we gonna forget that he pissed on a underaged girl? Wait what??\u201d\n\nOn the final date of their sold out arena tour, Xscape brought R. Kelly out on stage. Several members have daughters, and on a recent episode of The Real Housewives of Atlanta, Kandi Burruss took part in an anti-domestic violence PSA organized by her co-star Kenya Moore. Why shoot that and then allow this shit to happen?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet\u2019s talk about Jhen\u00e9 Aiko while we\u2019re at it. She has a duet with R. Kelly (2015's \u201cLet\u2019s Make Some Noise\u201d) and appears alongside Kelly on a recent Chris Brown track called \u201cJuicy Booty.\u201d I think of tranquility and good weed when I think of her, not complicity.\n\nLast year, I wrote about how sexism and racism within the music industry might compel some black female singers to join an R. Kelly tour bill. It remains a pity that a man like R. Kelly can continue to enjoy sizable support despite decades of being accused of sexual predatory behavior while talented women with less tawdry histories have to defer to and depend on him for visibility and money.\n\nThat was never an excuse for anyone who makes such a choice, but Lil\u2019 Kim and Xscape are far less vulnerable than those singers. Xscape had an all-female bill and sold out arenas across the country despite not having released an album in nearly 20 years. They made a willful choice to put that man on stage. It was the wrong one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe same goes for Lil\u2019 Kim. She is not far removed from the well-received Bad Boy Reunion Tour; has the likes of Beyonc\u00e9 dressing up as her for Halloween; has Remy Ma sampling her old hits to get radio airplay in this decade; and continues to enjoy a dedicated fan base that will pay to see her no matter the venue. And as a legend widely revered by artists of all genres, there are many people Lil\u2019 Kim could call for studio time. So it is a pity that she hasn\u2019t blocked R. Kelly\u2019s number already.\n\nI\u2019m not surprised when the likes of Chris Brown continue to work with R. Kelly, but I am perplexed when Xscape and Lil\u2019 Kim and Jhen\u00e9 Aiko still do. I\u2019ve long questioned men who support other men accused of predatory behavior, but evidently, there are women whose choices warrant similar inquiries.\n\nI don\u2019t care how much folks enjoy 12 Play and The Chocolate Factory. In 2018, it\u2019s fuck R. Kelly forever. I don\u2019t know if we can ever truly rid ourselves of Pissy considering we exist in a celebrity-driven news market with an insatiable craving for content, but there is certainly a way to minimize R. Kelly as much as possible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe can stop inviting him to award shows. We can stop playing him on the radio. We can stop allowing him to be booked in big arenas; we can let his peeing ass perform in some miserable somebody\u2019s backyard or preferred circle of hell instead. We can stop allowing him space on our sold-out arena tours. We can cut those studio sessions out of the budget. We can stop doing any single thing that allows him to keep thinking he\u2019s invincible and above reproach.\n\nEveryone who cares about black women and girls, consent, and autonomy should be down for that cause. If you aren\u2019t, you are part of the problem.

The family also says that an eyewitness account from Gaines' next-door neighbor paints a different picture of the day from what police statements have indicated.\n\nPolice have said that Gaines was shot after pointing a shotgun at officers and threatening to kill them after they tried to serve arrest warrants on her and her boyfriend, the site notes.

There is no way they were threatened by anything. He was only trying to get away.\u201d\n\nThe encounter started when officers pulled over Harmon for riding a bicycle without a light. How does a man wind up dead from a traffic stop over a bicycle?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNonetheless, Salt Lake City officials insist that the shooting was justified because officers feared for their lives. Of course. It is completely natural to fear someone who is running in the opposite direction from you. Never mind that footage clearly shows that another officer had deployed his Taser at the same time Fox fatally shot Harmon.\n\nAccording to The Guardian, the district attorney\u2019s office claimed that Harmon said, \u201cI\u2019ll cut you,\u201d then turned and faced officers with a knife as he was running.\n\nThe video seems to tell another story, however, since Harmon cannot be heard making that threat and never appears to turn toward officers before he is shot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEditor\u2019s note: Video contains graphic footage.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe was scared. All he did was run,\u201d Adriane Harmon, another niece, told The Guardian. \u201cIt hurts. \u2026 They said, \u2018I\u2019m going to kill you,\u2019 and they shot him three times. He\u2019s just moaning on the ground.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the Tribune, when officers stopped Harmon for his alleged traffic infraction, Harmon apparently gave the officer a name that did not have a match in the police database. The officer again asked Harmon to spell his last name, and according to the district attorney\u2019s report, Harmon gave \u201ca couple of different names.\u201d\n\nFootage shows Harmon spelling his name quietly as the officer asked for clarification several times. Eventually the officer went back to his squad car, and Harmon admitted to the officer that he may find a warrant out for a felony charge.\n\nThe officer called for backup, and two more officers arrived on the scene.\n\nEventually, the officer did find out that Harmon had arrest warrants out, including one for a felony related to an aggravated assault charge. The warrant was issued in April after Harmon did not show up for sentencing after pleading guilty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere was also another warrant out for Harmon regarding his not complying with probation requirements after pleading guilty in a misdemeanor drug-possession case, the records show.\n\nAnd so, officers informed Harmon that he was going to be arrested under those warrants.\n\nAs officers started to detain him, Harmon was heard pleading with officers, apparently not wanting to go to jail, and he appeared to be crying. And that\u2019s when he bolted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe officer who originally stopped Harmon drew his stun gun, but the other officer, Fox, decided that three shots at a fleeing suspect were appropriate.\n\nFox told investigators that he saw a knife in Harmon\u2019s hand with the blade exposed and believed that another officer was in danger\u2019s way.\n\nAll of that is, again, not clear in the video.\n\nWhat is decidedly clear is Fox shouting, \u201cI\u2019ll fucking shoot you!\u201d before firing at Harmon\u2019s back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite the fact that Harmon was critically wounded, officers still handcuffed him, though they attempted to give him first aid at the scene.\n\nInvestigators say they found a knife on the ground.\n\nAs The Guardian notes, Salt Lake City had previously been praised for its \u201cde-escalation\u201d training, and the department is known for giving out \u201cde-escalation awards.\u201d However, such de-escalation seems not to have come into play in Harmon\u2019s case.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe police are going to stick together no matter if it\u2019s wrong or right,\u201d Antoinette Harmon, Harmon\u2019s older sister, told The Guardian. \u201cThey don\u2019t care about black lives.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat officer disregarded his de-escalation training,\u201d Lex Scott, a local Black Lives Matter organizer, told The Guardian. \u201cIt\u2019s just brutal. How could anyone with eyes and ears believe that that officer was justified?\u201d\n\nThe Salt Lake City Police Department declined to answer any questions about the case, but Police Chief Mike Brown released a statement: \u201cWe trust the process and support the decision from District Attorney Sim Gill. I believe our officers have the training and judgement and ability to make split-second decisions in dynamic situations.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at the Salt Lake Tribune and The Guardian.", "keywords": ["shows", "guardian", "salt", "justified", "utah", "officers", "knife", "video", "harmon", "fatally", "lake", "flee", "man", "told", "district", "officer", "shooting", "black", "harmons"], "polarity": -0.019805194805194798, "subjectivity": 0.4253463203463203},

What happened next is still up for debate.\n\nThe LAPD says that the man resisted, fought with the cops and eventually tried to grab an officer\u2019s gun. The man\u2019s family says that he was unarmed and suffering from mental illness and was a victim of police brutality. A bystander\u2019s video showed officers manhandling, punching and choking the Cameroonian man. There is only one thing that every party agrees on:\n\nAn officer of the LAPD shot and killed Charly \u201cAfrica\u201d Keunang.\n\nIt seems like it would be an easy thing to clear up. At least three officers on the scene were outfitted with body cameras that captured the incident. But for three years the city of Los Angeles refused to release the footage, until the Los Angeles Times, after a lengthy court battle, obtained the videos from those bodycams on Tuesday.\n\nThe videos show Keunang standing in front of his tent arguing with policemen as Francisco Martinez, an officer who Skid Row residents called a \u201chard-ass bitch cop,\u201d threatens to shoot Keunang with a Taser. Keunang goes back inside his tent and tells the officers to \u201cleave me alone.\u201d As Keunang exits his tent again, the video shows Martinez tasing him. At least three officers pounce on him.

He is being shocked repeatedly. He is being punched. He begins spinning wildly. Volasgis shouts: \u201cHe has my gun! He has my gun!\u201d\n\nThen an officer raises his gun and shoots Charly Keunang.\n\nThe officers look for Volasgis\u2019 gun in Charly\u2019s hand, but it is not in Charly\u2019s hand. It is not on the ground. It is not in the tent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe gun is still in Volasgis\u2019 holster.\n\nThe LAPD released an \u201cenhanced image\u201d from another officer\u2019s camera that supposedly shows Keunang grabbing an officer\u2019s weapon, although the family\u2019s attorneys say that they cannot see it. Eleven months later, a closed-door hearing conducted by the Los Angeles Police Commission would reach the same conclusion: that Keunang died after grabbing a policeman\u2019s weapon. City prosecutors would never file charges against the officers.\n\nCharly \u201cAfrica\u201d Keunang is dead.\n\nStill.\n\nHe would be approximately the 175th person shot and killed by police in 2015, according to GQ magazine.

The #MeToo founder has been rightfully getting her shine since the movement bearing the name she coined caught Hollywood\u2019s attention last fall. In the months since, she has appeared on red carpets, been honored in Time magazine, and become a regular on the talk and news show circuits.\n\nBut amid all the fanfare, the one thing Burke has never neglected is her mission to support and protect black and brown girls and women, a point she made abundantly clear when she appeared on Comedy Central\u2019s The Opposition With Jordan Klepper on Thursday\u2014her segment begins at the 15:31 mark.\n\n\u201cWe started #MeToo because it was an exchange of empathy between survivors, to let them know that they\u2019re not alone,\u201d she said.\n\nSince Klepper\u2019s show is satirical, he naturally played devil\u2019s advocate when discussing the need and motives of #MeToo, voicing the increasingly irrational concerns of men who likely feel that the movement endangers their right to sexual entitlement. When asked by Klepper about the danger of conflating sexual harassment and assault under the umbrella of a single hashtag, Burke illustrated the larger danger of ignoring the insidious nature of sexual harassment:\n\nThere\u2019s no conflation; there\u2019s actually a spectrum. And so, sexual harassment and sexual abuse and sexual violence are on a spectrum. On one end, we have sexual harassment, which creates hostile environments and make people uncomfortable and really open a gateway for more intense violence. So they can all live under the same hashtag.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe went on to point out that #MeToo\u2019s actual mission is \u201cempowerment through empathy\u201d\u2014a mission that we share here at The Glow Up. When Klepper playfully quipped that he thought empathy to be synonymous with weakness, Burke very seriously replied:\n\nEmpathy is actually the opposite of weakness; it is the power between two people. ... When one person says to another person, \u201cMe too,\u201d that person has shared something about a trauma that they experienced. The other person is empowered by that; it\u2019s the power in knowing that you\u2019re not alone, it\u2019s the power in knowing that somebody believes you, and hears you, and sees you, and is there for you.\n\nBut ever the comedian, Klepper wasn\u2019t done, ribbing Burke on why she continues to fix her social media gaze upon alleged serial sexual abuser and pedophile R. Kelly. Through Klepper\u2019s satirical lens, Kelly\u2019s only relevance should be related to his record releases. Burke coolly responded with the clapback of the night: \u201cYou know what else he hasn\u2019t released? The women that he\u2019s holding captive in houses in Atlanta and Chicago.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I tell you that I stood up and applauded and whooped with the studio audience! And as always, Burke brought the movement back to black and brown girls and their specific vulnerability\u2014and invisibility\u2014in discussions of sexual abuse.\n\n[P]eople tend to not care about things that affect the most marginalized amongst us. [Kelly\u2019s] victims, the people who he seeks out are vulnerable girls who come from vulnerable communities, and they look like me, mostly. ... [N]ow\u2014largely because of this movement\u2014we are bringing more attention to people like R. Kelly and hoping that we can take him down.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll in all, in our current era of catchphrases, memes and passing trends, Burke\u2019s appearance on The Opposition was a cogent reminder that our collective work must continue, even\u2014no, especially\u2014amid all the well-deserved attention. She also made sure that The Opposition\u2019s audience left knowing that #MeToo is far more than a hashtag:\n\n\u201cThe #MeToo movement is here to stay,\u201d said Burke.", "keywords": ["metoo", "focused", "klepper", "power", "sexual", "tarana", "person", "sisters", "knowing", "harassment", "burke", "movement", "keeps", "mission", "keeper"], "polarity": 0.14142149003260113, "subjectivity": 0.49962408990186763},

The site uses information from a number of sources, including Killed by Police, Fatal Encounters and the U.S. Police Shootings Database, to break down shootings by race, location, weapons used, and whether or not the victim was armed. It is a valuable tool used by academics, researchers and certain writers at The Root.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAside from the fact that only 1 percent of the officers who killed someone were charged with a crime in 2017, some of the report\u2019s most interesting facts include the following:\n\n\n\nOf the 534 killer cops Mapping Police Violence was able to identify, 43 had shot or killed someone before. Twelve had previously shot or killed multiple people.\n\nMost of the people killed (718) were suspects in nonviolent offenses, were stopped for traffic violations or had committed no crime at all.\n\n13 percent of people killed by cops were unarmed.\n\nMost of the unarmed victims were people of color. Of the 147 unarmed people killed by police, 48 were black and 34 were Hispanic.\n\nBlack people accounted for 27 percent of the people killed by law enforcement officers. Of the unarmed victims of police violence, blacks made up 37 percent, almost three times their percentage of the U.S. population (13 percent).\n\nOf the people who were unarmed and not attacking, but were still killed by cops, 35 percent were black.\n\n95 people were killed when police shot at a moving vehicle, a practice that many say should be banned.\n\n170 of the people killed were armed with a knife. in 117 of those incidents, police shot the person before trying any other method to disarm the person.\n\n20 percent of the people who had a gun when they were killed were not threatening anyone.\n\nLaw enforcement training spends seven times more hours training officers on the use of firearms than on how to de-escalate situations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAgain, only 12 officers were charged with a crime after killing 1,129 citizens they were sworn to protect and serve. Here\u2019s to another banner year of police getting away with murder.\n\nCan\u2019t you feel America getting great again?\n\nRead more at the 2017 Police Violence Report.", "keywords": ["cops", "charged", "officers", "violence", "heres", "killed", "shot", "unarmed", "number", "crime", "2017"], "polarity": 0.05695693195693197, "subjectivity": 0.3384268509268509},

New York City Police Department Assistant Commissioner Peter Donald says that the department investigated the claim and could find no evidence that the incident ever took place, according to TMZ.\n\nOn Tuesday, the rapper visited radio station WEDR-FM to promote her music. After a brief preamble explaining why she didn\u2019t want the incident to take away from the fact that her single \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d was currently No. 1 on the Billboard charts, the Black Senate-confirmed ambassador of bloody shoes broke down and explained the entire story in full detail.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNote: Because Google Translate lacks the necessary English-to-Ghetto algorithm, we ran Cardi B\u2019s story through our proprietary code-switching technology to translate the story for our non-Ebonics-speaking audience.\n\n\u201cThis what happened, right[1],\u201d Ms. B began, explaining that she was in a car with her cousin stuck in traffic because Donald Trump was visiting the United Nations preparing to kick off a nuclear war, causing the entire city to be\u2014as Cardi so eloquently put it\u2014\u201cdumb tight.\u201d[2, 3]\n\n1. When anyone not of the Caucasian persuasion begins a story with \u201cThis what happened, right,\u201d or the more hyperbolic superlative \u201cThis what had happened,\u201d you must listen intently because this shit is about to be good.\n\n2. Dumb: An adverb meaning \u201cexceedingly.\u201d (Not to be confused with \u201cstupid,\u201d which means \u201cvery,\u201d or \u201cmad,\u201d which loosely translates as \u201cextremely.\u201d) I know ... this can sometimes get mad confusing.\n\n3. Tight: Adjective meaning \u201cagitated.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Love & Hip Hop: New York star went on to explain how she was involved in an accident when another driver hit her car. She regaled the audience with the details of how she confronted the man who caused the collision:\n\nSo I got out the car, you know what I\u2019m saying? So I went to the motherfucker and said, \u201cMy nigga, I will fuck you up!\u201d And he\u2019s like said, \u201cBitch, I will fuck you up.\u201d So you know, that shit fucked me up.[4] So I started hitting his window. I did. Then I threw him a bottle of water. I did. I\u2019m not gonna lie ... then my cousin got out of the car and they both squared up.[5] You know that\u2019s my cousin, so I took off my shoe (you know I like to take off my shoe) and I threw it at the nigga! And the nigga threw it at me back! Now he squares up with my cousin[6] (now the shit gon\u2019 get real) and out of nowhere, a motherfucker put me in a choke hold!\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Disambiguation: In this instance, Cardi B\u2019s first and second use of \u201cI will fuck you up\u201d indicates the willingness to inflict bodily harm, whereas the subsequent use of \u201cfucked me up\u201d implies that she was temporarily flustered by the situation.\n\n5. Squared up: A term meaning the physical and mental preparation indicating readiness to fight. When one \u201csquares up,\u201d the feet are usually shoulder length apart, hands raised, and the combatants are face-to-face.\n\n6. Note the important use of \u201ccousin,\u201d which is not necessarily an indication of a blood relative. In the black vernacular, \u201ccousin\u201d is a term that implies a special relationship. The official black hierarchal scale ranks cousin only below God, mother and \u201cmy weed man.\u201d\n\nCardi then explains how she was put in a choke hold with her hands behind her back \u201clike a chicken wing\u201d[7], and she couldn\u2019t believe it because the cop ignored the two men about to \u201csquare up.\u201d But, she explained, the officer was \u201cso pussy,\u201d[8] he didn\u2019t stop the men from fighting. Instead, the cop put her, a woman, in a choke hold.\n\nOnce the incident was over, Queen Cardi revealed how the police called her and came to her house asking her not to talk about it publicly. The unlyrical genius says she rejected them because \u201cI ain\u2019t never talked to no 12.\u201d[9]\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. In this case, \u201cchicken wing\u201d is not a simile. In the black community, the chicken wing is an actual martial arts move where a combatant twists his or her opponent\u2019s arm behind the back and up toward the middle of the shoulder blade, causing considerable pain.\n\n8. Pussy: A sexist pejorative meaning \u201cthe opposite of masculine.\u201d\n\n9. 12: Police officers. (From the cop show Adam 12. Similarly, \u201cFive-O\u201d comes from the police show Hawaii Five-0.)\n\nShe says the cops released a statement after she refused to talk to them, saying that they \u201cfound no evidence of her claims.\u201d She questioned why \u201cthe biggest gang in New York\u201d would declare such a lie if she never spoke with them, elaborating that the incident really bothered her.\n\nPerhaps the truest part of Cardi B\u2019s story was when she explained her refusal to talk to police. She said that she didn\u2019t think they would do anything about it and how she couldn\u2019t really recall the details. Cardi\u2019s biggest point on why she didn\u2019t cooperate was even more important.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn her infinite wisdom, she echoed the sentiments of almost every black person in America when she encapsulated law enforcement\u2019s treatment of people of color, why cops can\u2019t be trusted, and how they always escape scrutiny and punishment.\n\nIn true maker-of-money-moves fashion, the philosopher, poet and ratchet Jedi said, \u201cIt\u2019s just like ... you guys be lying,\u201d and then added: \u201cAnd this is why I don\u2019t talk to y\u2019all. Cuz you guys be lying.\u201d[10]\n\nIndeed, Cardi B ... indeed. They be lying.\n\n10.

Years before her success as a television host, she dominated New York City radio as a shock jock obsessed with celebrity gossip and provocative chitchat.\n\nShe spat vitriol that scathed her targets and caused many of them to retaliate, most notably Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs back in 1998, after she spread rumors that he was gay. The hip-hop mogul flexed his influence so hard, Williams was blackballed in her industry, bringing her career to a full stop for a number of years. But it was as clear then as it is today that she gives zero fucks about what rolls off her tongue.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sick of this #MeToo movement,\u201d she said during her show\u2019s \u201cHot Topics\u201d segment. \u201cI love that people are speaking up for the first time and coming out and everything, but now it\u2019s got\u2014I look at all men like, \u2018You\u2019re a #MeToo.\u2019 All of them. All of them, which is not fair.\u201d\n\nAnd in response to the recent #MuteRKelly campaign, Williams had this to say: \u201cWhat is this, 10 years too late? It\u2019s not going to work. Black people aren\u2019t really good at protesting. Not since the King march ... R. Kelly wasn\u2019t a \u2018me too.\u2019 Aaliyah voluntarily married him when she was 15 years old. Her parents voluntarily let her do it.\u201d\n\nWilliams\u2019 recent comments in response to the #MeToo and #MuteRKelly campaigns are, in my opinion, her most vile and disgusting to date. Not only did she de-emphasize the activists\u2019 initiative to aggressively protest at R. Kelly performances (at whatever point in time), but she argued on the crooner\u2019s behalf. Williams basically absolved Kelly, co-signed his statutory conduct and lambasted the young women who were linked to him.\n\n\n\nHer level of victim-blaming is both disturbing and reckless. Williams chided late songstress Aaliyah\u2014and, inaccurately, her parents\u2014for consenting to marriage with the R&B pervert. She also claimed that the teen girls who are currently part of Kelly\u2019s harem are willing participants\u2014and faulted their parents for that, too. And perhaps worst of all, the host also told her viewers that the 13-year-old girl allegedly featured in Kelly\u2019s sex tape\u2014whom he purportedly urinated on\u2014\u201cwas down with it.\u201d All because Williams is \u201csick of the #MeToo movement.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrankly, I am sick of Wendy Williams.\n\nWilliams\u2019 statements and defense of R. Kelly are a slap in the face to female survivors of sexual abuse, vulnerable girls and the movements that advocate for them. She is one of many black women whose thinking is so patriarchal, they engage in a brand of misogynoir that is not only foul AF, but downright dangerous.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s internalized racism and internalized misogyny,\u201d Stacey Patton told The Glow Up. Patton is assistant professor of multimedia journalism at Morgan State University and the author of Spare the Kids: Why Whupping Children Won\u2019t Save Black America. She said:\n\nThere\u2019s a long tradition of this, deeply tied to the history of slavery and racism. One of the core features of the racialization of black bodies is to create this narrative that they\u2019re sexual deviants. Black [women] have participated in that discourse, softly believing that if they adhere to rules about what it means to be a virtuous woman, that somehow it makes us more acceptable to society. So we can\u2019t, even in our imagination, believe young black girls can be victimized in this way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliams\u2019 narrative reeks of toxic femininity. In many black communities and households alike, young girls are emotionally victimized\u2014largely by women, long before they encounter men. They are unfairly sexualized according to their attitudes, bodies and mannerisms. Some of us may be familiar with the term \u201cacting womanish\u201d being directed at black girls. For those who are not, Dorothy Randall Tsuruta made it plain in her article for the Western Journal of Black Studies, where she explained:\n\n[The] culturally-derived concept, womanish (\u201cmannish\u201d for boys) is rooted in the social practice of Black adults, especially Black women, setting boundaries for Black girls.\n\nThough writer Alice Walker is sympathetic in redefining the expression to embolden young girls with womanish characteristics, many women remain stuck on its original connotations. They wax old toxic philosophies onto innocent girls\u2014much as Williams does, when she faults underage girls for their engagement with Kelly\u2014knowing full well that the law and power dynamics involved clearly define them as prey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t divorce that shaming of young black girls from the [parent] shaming we see online,\u201d Patton said, speaking of the extremes some women will go to to guilt their daughters.\n\nNothing good comes from this toxic policing of our girls. It upholds the patriarchal idea that black girls are fast-ass Jezebels who are sexually mature beyond their years and need to be subdued. It denies them the opportunity to be exactly who they are\u2014young girls. This castigation chips away their confidence, diminishes their self-esteem and stunts their agency. It robs them of the tools needed to protect themselves from being exploited\u2014sexually or otherwise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliams\u2019 dismissal of black women\u2019s agency is akin to silencing them. In a broader context, it contributes to the erasure of black women\u2014as if patriarchy, white feminism and the world at-large don\u2019t already have that task covered.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen this before\u2014when the FBI, white liberals and activist groups tried to suppress the female voices of #BlackLivesMatter by co-opting their agenda. More recently, we saw it when ESPN suspended Jemele Hill for \u201ca second violation of social media guidelines\u201d\u2014also known as expressing her views as a black woman about a \u201cwhite supremacist\u201d president. The attempt to quiet black women is overwhelming, and where we don\u2019t need it is in spaces or conversations among our own.\n\nThe #MuteRKelly campaign is long overdue. For over 20 years, Kelly has reportedly engaged in felonious sex with underage women and allegedly continues to do so with impunity. This is mainly because the black community has not held Kelly or other sexual miscreants like him accountable. The fact that the #MuteRKelly campaign\u2019s creators, Kenyette Barnes and Oronike Odeleye, have come through to do the extreme lifting that no one else bothered to do speaks volumes to their commitment to black woman and girls. That Williams denigrates their efforts by stating, \u201cIt\u2019s not going to work,\u201d further confirms that she does not value the voices of black women or their resistance.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOdeleye considers the slight a plus, telling The Glow Up:\n\nBy bringing up the #MuteRKelly discussion on the national stage, Wendy Williams helped spread the message that there are black women nationwide standing united to end the sexual, physical and mental abuse of our young black women. . .Wherever R. Kelly is performing, we\u2019ll be there. We won\u2019t rest until we have, at the very least, ended his career. We are working with the victims, victims\u2019 families and attorneys to bring yet another criminal case against him. We plan to be a needle in his side until he\u2019s in the poor house, a mental facility or a jail cell.\n\nTarana Burke, founder of the Me Too movement, also feels that Kelly\u2019s time is up and that he should not be \u201cconveniently\u201d left out of conversations on sexual assault, especially among black women.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBlack women are just as vocal about giving R. Kelly a chance. I\u2019ve seen Facebook statuses that say, \u2018I don\u2019t care who [R. Kelly] is fucking, I\u2019m going to see him tonight\u2014I\u2019m buying my ticket,\u2019\u201d Burke stated in a phone interview with The Glow Up.\n\nThe Me Too movement founded by Burke in 2006 is not be confused with the latest #MeToo movement tied to the sexual harassment and rape of women in Hollywood. Although the two intersect today, initially they did not. Burke\u2019s movement was specifically started for underserved black girls from low-income communities who were sexually victimized and in need of supportive healing.\n\nIn a series of tweets, Burke responded to Williams\u2019 inflammatory comments:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSexual violence knows no race, color, class or gender, but the response to sexual violence does,\u201d Burke said in our interview. \u201cThe response to sexual violence is highly gendered and highly racialized and definitely defined by class.\u201d\n\nYeah, that part.\n\nIt is this nuance that allows R. Kelly to get off scot-free. Williams is reckless and clearly driven by her black female antagonism in not making these distinctions. That Williams (and black women of the same ilk) can afford to be so \u201csick of\u201d #MeToo is really quite disconcerting. In the same vein as Kelly, she is both a trigger and the gun, busting shots at black women, exploiting them and denying their humanity. Like R. Kelly, Wendy is out here wildin\u2019, and she, too, needs to be put on mute.", "keywords": ["metoo", "r", "muterkelly", "kelly", "williams", "girls", "sexual", "young", "women", "wildin", "twisted", "wendy", "comes", "black", "assault"], "polarity": 0.01676189520560382, "subjectivity": 0.48182343778370257},

A 5-year-old boy who was with Gaines at the time of the shooting also suffered a gunshot wound, police said, but he is expected to survive.

Police say that she had the 5-year-old boy in her arms and was holding a long gun, which, police say, she pointed at one of the officers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThus began an hourslong negotiation, police say.\n\n\"During that dialogue and conversation, she repeatedly pointed a long gun at the police officers,\" Baltimore County Police Chief Jim Johnson told the Sun.\n\nSeveral hours later, at around 3 p.m., Gaines pointed the long gun at police officers again and told them that if they didn't leave, \"she was going to kill them,\" Johnson said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat's when an officer fired once at Gaines, and she fired back several times, the police chief said.

His death was followed weeks later by Michael Brown\u2019s killing by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo., the catalyst for the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nIn July 2016, two years after her father\u2019s death, Erica took on President Barack Obama and ABC News during a presidential town hall that the network was hosting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe activist got up and left the taping of the event after she said she had been \u201crailroaded\u201d by the network and denied the opportunity to ask the president a question, an opportunity that she said she had been promised.\n\nErica said that she had an agreement that she would be able to ask Obama about the Justice Department\u2019s investigation into her father\u2019s death, only to be blindsided.\n\nThe mother of two was particularly frustrated as she cleared time to go to Washington, D.C., even as she was planning an event for the then-two-year anniversary of her father\u2019s death.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwo months after taking that stand, she called out New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio after the mayor claimed that he was barred from releasing the records of her father\u2019s killer, Daniel Pantaleo, citing an archaic law that has been ignored for the past 30 years as the reason he could not do so.\n\n\u201cJust cause you love Black pussy don\u2019t mean you love Black lives\u2026 cc @BilldeBlasio,\u201d Garner wrote on Twitter, pointing out that de Blasio, a white man, is married to a black woman and raising a black son but still couldn\u2019t give a damn about state-sanctioned killings.\n\n\u201cThe thing that kills me is that De Blasio is raising a Black man ...

For Eric Garner, there was no reprieve from literal oppression. It killed him on that day. And his daughter, who was radicalized by his death, never stopped in her quest to garner justice for him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHundreds of mourners packed into First Corinthian Baptist Church in Harlem for the funeral, which at times seemed more like a production than a homegoing ceremony for the 27-year-old mother of two. Erica Garner was, above all else, a young black woman who, by some stroke of tragic luck, was thrust into activism because of the random, pervasive nature of police brutality in America.\n\nErica Garner died on Dec. 30 of a heart attack, months after giving birth to her son, Eric, named for her late father. Her mother spoke plaintively of her daughter during the service.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cShe was born at seven-and-a-half months, 4 pounds, 11 ounces, but she proved to be a giant,\u201d said Esaw Snipes-Garner, who recalled her daughter\u2019s brazen determination.\n\n\n\nSnipes-Garner said that she would beg Erica not to go out to protest, as she did twice a week for a year, trudging out to the Staten Island Ferry station, thick with commuters, rain or shine, to bring light to the nonindictment of the police officer who held her father in that fatal choke hold; a man still employed with the New York City Police Department.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t take care of these kids,\u201d Snipes-Garner said she told her, which, she noted, wryly, is exactly what she is now doing. \u201cShe lived on her own terms. And she died on her own terms.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer mom spoke of Erica\u2019s fiery spirit; her obstinate, aggressive belief in herself and her choices; and her unyielding love for her father. She also spoke proudly of the day Erica shut down New York\u2019s Verrazano Bridge, an eight-lane edifice that connects the New York City boroughs of Staten Island and Brooklyn.\n\n\n\n\u201cShe did it by herself,\u201d her mother said. \u201cEight lanes of traffic. She said, \u2018I can\u2019t breathe.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Rev. Al Sharpton, who did Erica\u2019s eulogy, also told that story.\n\nHe recounted: \u201cErica calls, and says, \u2018I done blocked two streets, but they won\u2019t arrest me.\u2019\u201d Sharpton said he responded that maybe the NYPD didn\u2019t want to touch the daughter of Eric Garner. So she responded, \u201cI stopped traffic and they won\u2019t arrest me. I\u2019m going to the bridge.\u201d And she did.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis was a real warrior,\u201d Sharpton boomed. \u201cShe didn\u2019t care about awards or press, she cared about justice!\u201d\n\n\n\nSharpton said that Erica didn\u2019t die of a heart attack but of a heart that was attacked, after seeing her father so brutally snuffed out with no recompense. The unfairness of it all; the unjustness of it all; the pain of her worst pain splayed out for all to see.\n\n\n\nThere were speeches. Sen. Bernie Sanders, for whom Erica campaigned in 2016, sent a letter. Sharpton acknowledged the people of note in attendance. There were lots of men in dark suits, mostly politicians and preachers (in Harlem, they\u2019re often one and the same, going back to Adam Clayton Powell Jr.); there were beautiful songs sung.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere was also a verbal and apparently physical altercation during the service, which turned out to be family members fighting with Eric Garner\u2019s mother, Gwen Carr, who said that she and her husband were turned away and attacked by other family members.\n\nAs the commotion took place, Sharpton stepped up as it was happening and said, \u201cEveryone has family divisions. We have to respect Erica,\u201d and the program moved on. Sharpton later lamented, \u201cAll of us have feuds, all of us have differences. I have some in my family I don\u2019t speak to now.

He said he\u2019d met Erica at an action once and was touched by her spirit.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to fight, and keep fighting, not only for the injustices, but for the positivity and the grace and the gifts that we\u2019ve been given from God,\u201d said Common. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna keep fighting for those things, that always will be there for us, and we\u2019ll keep fighting for our young people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMike Brown Sr., the father of Mike Brown, the 18-year-old killed by a Ferguson, Mo., police officer mere weeks after Eric Garner was killed, also came to pay his respects.\n\n\n\n\u201cI had to show my support for the family,\u201d he told The Root. \u201cThe family has been there with our family from day one.

The local news was beginning to feel like trauma porn and was much too close to home.\n\nThe purge had been a healthy choice\u2014that is, until national news infiltrated my timeline, the Twitterverse and the whole-ass webosphere with film executive Harvey Weinstein\u2019s alleged history of rape and sexual assault against women he worked with. Not long after, Kevin Spacey, lead actor of Bryan Singer\u2019s The Usual Suspects, entered a band of unusual suspects\u2014grown-ass men accused of sexually preying on children. Spacey apologized to his accuser, actor Anthony Rapp, who was 14 years old at the time he says he was assaulted, for \u201cwhat would have been deeply inappropriate behavior\u201d\u2014behavior that Spacey doesn\u2019t quite recall.\n\nWhile all of this news is disturbing, none of it hits close to home like the more obscure, resurfacing news of R&B musician R. Kelly and his alleged bizarre sexual practices and undying affinity for underage black girls. Apparently, the victimization of young black girls is not newsworthy enough for the mass media or the court of public opinion to be engrossed or enraged at Weinstein levels. Both treat the sexual assault of black girls as if it were hardly news at all. To a fault, they are right. The predatory sexualization of young black girls is so ubiquitous, it is damn near an accepted social and cultural norm.\n\n\n\nThe system of slavery helped us arrive at this place, where black girls are denied humanity. In captivity, their bodies were perpetually preyed upon. In bondage, they were much more than field hands and domestics. Not only did they have the duty of being medical lab rats, as was the case of Anarcha, Betsey and Lucy\u2014three slave girls used for gynecological experimentation by physician J. Marion Sims\u2014but they were also forced to sexually perform as bed wenches and breeders.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the most profound case, an enslaved Sally Hemings bore six children by her master, Thomas Jefferson, the first at age 15\u2014when he was 43. Because Jefferson kept her close, in a bedroom adjacent to his own, many historians make the mistake of romanticizing Hemings and Jefferson\u2019s relationship as some enchanting antebellum love affair, but we must be clear of its obvious implications. The dynamic between slaveholder and slave is one of absolute power. A sexual relationship between a fully grown man and an adolescent child is absolutely salacious. It is statutory rape\u2014albeit sanctioned by the laws of the land at the time.\n\n\n\nAnd although white supremacist, capitalist patriarchy serves as a springboard for society\u2019s well-established disregard of young black girls, the slave code ended 152 years ago. We all should know better and do better\u2014especially the black community.\n\nGrowing up between the late 1980s and early \u201990s, during the peak of the crack era, it was not uncommon to see fresh, baby-faced girls in the company of men who were well into their mid-20s or older. The practice of courting minors was not exclusive to any particular demographic of men. It included the dopes, the pushers, the addicts, everybody\u2014and for the most part, they all had short eyes. These sexual predators, in the heart of many hoods, exacted power over teenage girls through fast cars, money and drugs.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the Connecticut Alliance to End Sexual Violence, approximately 40 percent of black women report coercive sexual contact by age 18.\n\n\n\nI am no stranger to this lifestyle.\n\nI know firsthand about having one\u2019s virginity pounded into extinction, at the age of 14, for a pair of Reebok 54-11\u2019s and a pair of gold bangle earrings\u2014compliments of a 23-year-old fan. I was finessed. It was like taking candy from a baby, and it was also euphemized rape. Not one rational adult intervened.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSexual predation, for many black girls, starts long before the age of sexual awareness. They become innocent victims in their own households, social settings, churches and schools under the guise of supervision. These girls are preyed upon by family members, community leaders, religious figures and educators. In a lot of cases, they are disappointed in and dismissed by adults they should be able to trust.\n\n\n\nSome are victim-shamed; others are disbelieved or silenced by threats, like those the now-13-year-old alleged victim of Jelani Maraj, the brother of rapper Nicki Minaj, describes; those experienced by 18-year-old Anna Chambers, who tells of having been sexually assaulted by two New York City police officers while detained; and those made against the unprecedented number of girls whose names we do not know\u2014yes, #ThemToo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSexual violence is projected onto black girls at a higher rate than it is onto other races and ethnicities. In the Fourth National Incidence Study of Child Abuse and Neglect:\n\nAfrican-American women were 1.75 times more likely than white women to have experienced child sexual abuse.\n\n\n\nAfrican-American women were more likely to report the occurrence of child sexual abuse during adolescence.\n\n\n\nAfrican-American women were more likely to report an increased incidence of perpetrators living in the same household.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese facts are hella disturbing and reflect a culture of sexual violence against black girls that remains crickets as fuck. Where\u2019s the community outrage? Where is the overwhelming media coverage? For black girls, there is no black collective rallying against these crimes. There is no public shaming or takedown of sexual violators, because society gives zero fucks, and the black community protects its villains and devalues its girls.\n\nTarana Burke, founder of the #MeToo movement\u2014an initiative that supports young women surviving sexual assault\u2014agrees that in the black community, the value of girls is at an all-time low. \u201cWe all have to be accountable for how we view and protect and cast our black girls,\u201d Burke says.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a phone interview, she expressed that \u201cthe world diminishes black girls and the black community upholds it.\u201d This flagrant attitude toward young black women is the very thing that keeps R. Kelly in business and away from major media attention.\n\nBurke makes it clear that Weinstein and Kelly are of the same ilk. She notes that while the former receives a national flogging for sexually assaulting grown white women, the latter continues to get away unscathed for alleged sex crimes against underage black girls. Black people\u2019s allegiance to Kelly is reflective of how the black community celebrates its villains, and hints at the lack of value placed on young girls.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBlack people have to shift their way of thinking when it comes to black girls. We have to believe our young girls and recognize when they\u2019ve been violated. Support them.\u201d \u2014Tarana Burke\n\nAs simple as it seems, Burke\u2019s statement is a whole-ass word.\n\n\n\nBut what statement is Snoop Dogg making when he features R. Kelly at his wife\u2019s birthday event? What do his actions convey to young black girls?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe\u2019s a clown\u2014shitting on black-girl value.\n\nInstead of inviting predators to the barbecue, Sunday dinner and birthday bashes; instead of calling out a high-profile Hollywood rapist, perhaps we should be as vigilant in calling out our own. As Burke puts it, \u201cKelly belongs to us. He is ours to deal with.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe must begin to fully reckon with that dealing. That also goes for those uncles who we know have their own Weinstein-length histories of fondling pubescent nieces; brothers who overpower young sisters, as actor Kevin Spacey allegedly did his victim; friendly neighbors who stalk our girls\u2019 bodies; Ahk and them from the corner bodega, who bribe young daughters into storeroom closets; hustlers who pick and pluck them; pimps who turn them out. Like Robert Kelly, they ain\u2019t shit.\n\nWhen we seek accountability from others, perhaps we hold ourselves accountable as well, for aiding and abetting, for being quiet, for turning blind eyes to those in close proximity. \u2019Cause at the end of the day, if we\u2019re going to normalize pedophilia and sexual misconduct in our own spaces, perpetuated on our own girls, then we must acknowledge our own complicity\u2014admit that we, too, ain\u2019t shit.\n\nJustification for that type of foul ain\u2019t justice at all. If we stop letting heathens off the hook for sexualizing our babies, then perhaps we can stop blaming our babies for being sexualized.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIda Harris is aiight with standard English but poetic with black vernacular.

But the picture many saw told only one side of the story.\n\nPolice killed the woman, Korryn Gaines, and her 5-year-old son was wounded in the altercation. She had attempted to share her encounter with police using Instagram. The police urged Facebook, which owns Instagram, to deactivate her accounts. In response, Facebook cut Gaines\u2019 live stream from its feed.\n\n\n\nThis wasn\u2019t an isolated incident. In July, Diamond Reynolds used Facebook Live to record the immediate aftermath of the horrific police shooting of her boyfriend, Philando Castile. Once footage hit 1 million views, Facebook temporarily removed the video. A Facebook spokesperson claimed this was due to a \u201ctechnical glitch,\u201d but many media reports suggest otherwise.\n\nFor many, Facebook has come to represent a public square\u2014a place where we can assemble with others, share information and speak our minds. But it isn\u2019t public. It\u2019s a private platform where everyone\u2019s rights to connect and communicate are subject to Facebook\u2019s often arbitrary terms and conditions.\n\nThe Constitution protects everyone\u2019s right to record police officers in the public discharge of their duties. But this right goes only as far as your smartphone. Once people decide to share the resulting videos\u2014including those that expose shocking police abuses\u2014the potential for state and private forces to censor the footage becomes very real.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFacebook claims to take down or block videos that glorify violence and says that it will grant law-enforcement requests to suspend accounts in cases where there is an \u201cimmediate risk of harm,\u201d but that\u2019s a vague and difficult standard to apply, and one that\u2019s subject to police discretion.\n\nThe Gaines and Reynolds videos remind us that social media companies like Facebook, Google (which owns YouTube) and Twitter ultimately control our ability to share the images that have fueled the Movement for Black Lives.\n\nThe fact that these companies can arbitrarily remove our speech, images and videos has serious consequences for those struggling to expose racial injustice to a wider audience. Earlier this week, more than 40 social justice and digital-rights groups sent Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg a letter (pdf) urging the company to clarify its policy on honoring police requests to censor videos and other content.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe groups, which include the Center for Media Justice, ColorOfChange.org, Daily Kos, Free Press and SumOfUs, also asked Facebook to restore Gaines\u2019 videos from her encounter with police so the public can decide whether the police violated her rights.\n\nIn the second half of 2015, Facebook received 855 requests from government and local authorities, including local police forces, for \u201cemergency\u201d action related to users\u2019 accounts. According to Facebook, these actions included the blocking of user access to accounts as well as the handover of user information. Over that time period, the company complied with nearly 3 out of every 4 such requests.\n\nThis raises several questions: Will police demand that Facebook cover up potential abuses that witnesses have recorded and then shared on the platform, even when there is no real risk of immediate harm? And how will it respond when the risk of harm comes from police violence itself? Shouldn\u2019t our right to record such interactions with law enforcement include our right to share these recordings with others?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFacebook needs clear guidelines and processes that are transparent to users on how it determines whether to block someone\u2019s stream or deactivate an account. It shouldn\u2019t allow police to demand takedown requests to avoid scrutiny or cover up abuse. We need to know when and why Facebook and other social media platforms have granted these requests, with clear standards for the future.\n\n\u201cRisk of harm\u201d is a factor, but one could interpret that standard to justify censoring almost any interaction with law enforcement\u2014and especially those in which an interaction escalates because of a person\u2019s race.\n\nThe fight for racial equity in the media is often a fight against media monopoly, especially when these companies are white-owned and operated. And Facebook is a face of monopoly in the age of social media.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNew gatekeepers like Facebook must make confronting racism a priority. Yes, Zuckerberg has been outspoken in his support for racial justice\u2014even hanging a Black Lives Matter sign outside company headquarters. But we must urge him to ensure that his company\u2019s actions match his words. Providing clarity and accountability on Facebook\u2019s policy for suspending accounts and blocking images of police encounters is a start.\n\nThe Root aims to foster and advance conversations about issues relevant to the black Diaspora by presenting a variety of opinions from all perspectives, whether or not those opinions are shared by our editorial staff.\n\nTimothy Karr is the senior director of strategy for Free Press, a nonpartisan organization that advocates for universal access to an open and affordable internet.

Rialmo said that he fired from the building\u2019s front porch. However, it has since been determined that it was more likely that Rialmo fired from between the bottom of the porch and the sidewalk outside.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA \u201creasonable officer,\u201d the board concluded, would have had no reason to believe that he was in danger of death or serious injury.\n\nIt was not immediately made public what recommendations for punishment disciplinary authorities made, but the Tribune notes that the Civilian Office of Police Accountability usually recommends termination for officers involved in unjustified shootings. After that, Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson will have three months to decide what form of discipline, if any, he will take.\n\nRialmo\u2019s attorney, of course, is paid to argue for his client, and he claimed that the agency\u2019s ruling cast the evidence in a misleading light, pointing out that LeGrier appeared to be suffering from a mental health crisis during the incident.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI challenge anybody not to feel that their life was in danger in such a situation,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a political decision, not one based on the evidence. ... This has got nothing to do with facts.\u201d\n\nLeGrier\u2019s mother, on the other hand, is thankful that someone sees her son\u2019s death for what it was.\n\n\u201cEach time they mention Quintonio and Bettie, they would always make it like my baby caused her death. And I know he didn\u2019t. I knew he was just as much a victim as she was. He was innocent, too,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is worth noting that the Cook County District Attorney\u2019s Office declined to prosecute Rialmo in February, claiming that there was insufficient evidence (evidence that COPA managed to get its hands on, but I digress) that Rialmo was not acting in self-defense.\n\nEarlier this month, just to add insult to injury, attorneys for the city of Chicago announced that they were toying with the idea of suing LeGrier\u2019s family, claiming that he\u2014a teen suffering through a mental health crisis\u2014was to blame for Jones\u2019 death.\n\nRialmo himself filed a lawsuit against LeGrier\u2019s estate on the grounds of emotional distress and assault, claiming that the teen forced Rialmo to kill him. Rialmo also sued the city of Chicago, saying that he was not properly trained to handle tense encounters with those with mental illness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at the Chicago Tribune.", "keywords": ["chicago", "evidence", "mental", "officers", "fired", "jones", "board", "finds", "unjustified", "office", "tribune", "fatal", "officer", "shooting", "oversight", "rialmo", "legrier", "quintonio"], "polarity": 0.04088541666666666, "subjectivity": 0.33385416666666656},

I believe that love is a byproduct of love. I believe that hate made love to an orange, had a petty-ass baby, and that\u2019s how we got the grapefruit. I believe that cats were put on earth to kill things. And I believe the universe recycles.\n\n\n\nReincarnation is real. When we stop breathing, our bodies will all eventually turn into the fuel for flowers and trees. Those trees will, in turn, take the fuel of our decomposed former selves and convert carbon dioxide into oxygen that a newborn baby will one day inhale for the first time. We are all dying. To die is to give life.\n\nAnd if my body becomes a tiny point in the circle of life, it only makes sense that my soul will also be reincarnated. I have no idea how the universe may use my factory-refurbished soul. I\u2019m cool with becoming a yak or a large-mouthed bass in the next life. (Fair warning to the universe: I am a terrible swimmer.) There is only one thing I pray I will never be:\n\nThe white man.\n\nNot a white man, but the white man. The perpetual oppressor of people. The kicker of teeth. He who places boot on neck. I pray to the man upstairs (I\u2019m getting my roof fixed right now) that when my soul is washed, dried and placed in the \u201cbarely used\u201d bin of the universal thrift shop, I am not remade into the white man.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI often fling disdain at people who unknowingly participate in white-mannery. I believe that any white person not actively fighting to end every form of racism and oppression is an accomplice. I fault white people who sit silently while their fellow Caucasians say or do something racist when no one black is around. I consider them to be upholders of white supremacy as much as the cross burners or swastika wearers.

And just as with racism, that willingness to turn our heads and not condemn sexual assault is an implicit signal that it is OK.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne night while I was having a few drinks with friends, a guy recognized someone at my table and came over to say hi. At some point during his conversation, the waitress came over, and out of nowhere, he asked this teenage-looking girl: \u201cCan you make it clap?\u201d\n\nEveryone knew it was kind of creepy, but I said, \u201cHey, man, what the fuck is wrong with you? That girl is, like, 16.\u201d He tried to laugh it off by joking: \u201cYou know what Keith Sweat said: She may be young, but ... \u201d\n\nBy then the rest of the people at the table agreed that he was being a little bit rapey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA few months later, I was with the same friends at the same watering hole (what, motherfucker?

Because I\u2019m not originally from this town (and apparently only go to one place to have drinks), I assumed that I didn\u2019t know who they were talking about.\n\nIt was the same rapey table crasher.\n\nHere\u2019s my point. I\u2019m not insinuating that every guy who makes suggestive comments to a Buffalo Wild Wings waitress is a potential sexual assaulter. But I wonder how often we perpetuate the ideology of the disposability of women\u2019s bodies by just not saying shit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf we are honest, every single man has known a guy who was a habitual line stepper when it came to women or who was a little bit rapey. The frat brother who will grab a random woman\u2019s booty. The boss who has tried to fuck everyone in the office. The football teammate who always talks about \u201crunning a train.\u201d I also believe every single white person has a parent, co-worker or cousin (wait ... do white people have cousins?) who leans a \u201clittle bit racist.\u201d\n\nBut just like there is no such thing as being a little bit racist, there is no such thing as being \u201ca little bit rapey.\u201d\n\nWhy are we cool with one and not the other?\n\nIf we refused to remain quiet about the dudes who do this shit, I\u2019m not saying that it would end sexual assault, but it might curtail the actions of the men whose actions are fueled by the complicity of silence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEveryone knew about Harvey Weinstein and didn\u2019t say shit.

Baltimore County police shot and killed 23-year-old Korryn Gaines in a confrontation at her home that injured her 5-year-old son. Officers used lethal force to execute an arrest warrant, actions that many are questioning as a needless provocation that we\u2019ve seen too many times before. The fact that Gaines previously used social media to record her interactions with police and that she may have been suffering from emotional problems only exacerbates this latest tragedy.\n\nIn Los Angeles\u2019 Compton neighborhood, Donnell Thompson, a mentally challenged black man, was killed by SWAT officers who mistakenly believed that he was a carjacker. The incident happened in late July, and authorities are only now admitting the case of mistaken identity. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t treat an animal this bad,\u201d observed his sister as she mourned her brother\u2019s senseless death.\n\nThe same day Thompson was killed in California, Chicago police chased down and killed Paul O\u2019Neal, an 18-year-old suspected car thief. Police cameras show officers repeatedly shooting at the vehicle O\u2019Neal was driving and handcuffing him as he lay in his own pool of blood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe coroner\u2019s finding that O\u2019Neal had been shot in the back has led to widespread protest in Chicago, which has a horrific recent history of anti-black police shootings.\n\nBut the latest front in this ongoing racial battlefield is in Milwaukee, which erupted after police shot and killed a 23-year-old armed black man during a confrontation. Local residents staged protests\u2014some of which turned violent\u2014that railed against decades of civic neglect in some of the city\u2019s poorest areas.\n\nJust as in Ferguson and Baltimore, television images capturing racial violence on Milwaukee\u2019s impoverished north side focused on burning cars, looted stores, and clashes between police and demonstrators while glossing over the high rates of poverty, unemployment and police abuse of local residents in which the violence is rooted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, the focus in the media is on the symptoms of systemic racism\u2014unrest and protest\u2014and not the root cause igniting these fires. But not everyone is turning a blind eye to the blight, neglect and police-inflicted violence that plague these neighborhoods.\n\nThe Department of Justice\u2019s recent report on racist police practices in Baltimore inadvertently explains Milwaukee\u2019s uprising and serves as a warning that, without substantive political changes, other cities may explode. The Baltimore report reveals a brutally exploitative system of racial profiling, harassment and drug arrests that constitutes a virtual war against black residents waged by a Police Department that is 44 percent black.\n\n\u201cA Vision for Black Lives,\u201d a radical policy agenda authored by a coalition of Black Lives Matter activists, represents a political and policy response to events happening in Milwaukee, Baltimore and elsewhere around the nation. The agenda calls for eliminating racial bias in prisons at the federal, state and local levels and redirecting federal resources from prison building and police task forces into community building; drug rehabilitation; mental-health facilities; and education, employment and environmental resources.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore important, the BLM policy agenda challenges all Americans to reimagine the relationship among citizens, governments and institutions. In short, it calls for a political revolution. Racial violence and dehumanization in America have become so routine that for every black body that receives national attention, there are many more whose deaths are rendered virtually invisible.\n\nChanging this cycle requires taking funds used to militarize police departments and redistributing them to black communities in need of mental-health services, jobs, schools and drug-rehabilitation facilities. The philosophy of law and order has corrupted not only the criminal-justice system but also much of America\u2019s political system. Assaults on black voting rights, chronic unemployment, deteriorating schools and neighborhoods, and the astonishing increase in the number of black women in city jails are all part of our ongoing national civil discourse that is rarely mentioned in public, but whose effects proliferate all around us.\n\nThe criminal-justice system represents a gateway to institutions, polices and practices that are undermining the life chances of black people at a generational level. As the Baltimore report shows, the real tragedy lies in acknowledging the black quotidian: the struggles of ordinary, everyday African-American communities to survive against a war-torn landscape where police act less as public servants and more as an occupying army for a war that\u2019s been waged for decades but has yet to be publicly declared.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeniel E.

However, he said, he ended up being pushed over a guard rail and ultimately blacked out and was unable to recall details after he hit his head on the ground.\n\n\u201cThis shit needs to stop and stop now,\u201d attorney Lord said, adding that she plans to file a civil tort claim notice against the city. \u201cI\u2019ve been complaining about police brutality in this city for decades. It\u2019s about time they do something about it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLord said that she probably will not call for the resignation of city Police Director Ernest Parrey Jr., who is currently under fire as other allegations of brutality flood the department. She thinks that the issue within Trenton goes far beyond one person and is more deeply entrenched.\n\nThree other city cops were already caught on a body camera discussing how to get away with using excessive force, prompting the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey to call for an outside investigation into whether the department has a pattern or practice of brutality, The Trentonian notes.\n\nParrey himself is also under scrutiny personally, having been caught on tape calling residents \u201chood rats,\u201d a term critics have called racist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTorres spent three days in the hospital\u2014handcuffed to a bed\u2014after his encounter. He was charged with aggravated assault on officers, resisting arrest and drug possession\u2014as cops say they found cocaine and marijuana after stopping him.\n\nPhotos of Torres show him sporting two black eyes and multiple scratches and bruises.

On Nov. 19, 2011, he somehow set off his medical device. When an emergency operator tried to talk to Chamberlain through a loudspeaker in his bedroom, he didn\u2019t respond, so she called an ambulance. The White Plains, N.Y., Police Department followed the ambulance to Chamberlain\u2019s home, where he answered the door.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe told the officers that everything was OK, but that wasn\u2019t enough. The medical-device operator personally called the White Plains Police Department to cancel the emergency call, but that wasn\u2019t enough, either. Chamberlain\u2019s niece, who lived downstairs, asked the cops to let her speak to him, but they wouldn\u2019t.\n\nThe cops insisted on coming in, so they tried to break down the door for over an hour. During that hour, the cops yelled at Chamberlain. They screamed for him to open the door. Chamberlain yelled through the door: \u201cI\u2019m a sick old man,\u201d to which Officer Stephen Hart replied, \u201cWe don\u2019t give a fuck, nigger!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen the officers finally broke the door down, they shot the 68-year-old man with a Taser in the neck and abdomen. Then they shot him with a less-than-lethal beanbag from a shotgun. They hit him with a baton. Then one of the officers claimed that a 68-year-old man, who had already been shot with a Taser and a beanbag gun and couldn\u2019t walk 40 feet without wheezing, attacked them with a knife. So the officer shot Kenneth Chamberlain in the chest.\n\nTwice.\n\nFor five months, the police refused to identify the officer who shot Chamberlain. When the name of the officer, Anthony Carelli, was finally identified, he insisted that Chamberlain was going to kill him with the butcher knife he was holding as he charged at the officer. Even after the information came out that Carelli was facing a $10 million lawsuit for beating two brothers and calling them \u201crag heads,\u201d the Police Department, the police union and Carelli stuck with the story. They stuck by the story even when the autopsy showed that Chamberlain wasn\u2019t even facing the officer. They stuck by the story even when the coroner said that Chamberlain couldn\u2019t have been holding a knife. Carelli stuck by his story even after it was proved that Chamberlain\u2019s hands were at his side when he was shot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd Anthony Carelli got away with it.\n\nHe didn\u2019t go to trial. A grand jury refused to indict the officers. A federal jury rejected a civil suit against Carelli and the city of White Plains in 2016 after the judge refused to allow evidence of the racial slurs or Carelli\u2019s past. Now Joon Kim, who replaced U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara when he was fired by President Donald Trump after refusing to resign, has announced that no civil rights charges will be filed, according to the Associated Press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a statement announcing his reasoning for closing the case, Kim said:\n\n\u201cOfficer Carelli believed that Sergeant Martin was in danger of being seriously injured by Mr. Chamberlain. The investigation revealed no evidence to refute Officer Carelli\u2019s testimony that he shot Mr. Chamberlain in response to his belief that Sergeant Martin was in danger of being seriously physically injured by Mr. Chamberlain.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s the Justice Department\u2019s reason for closing the case. Because it is OK to shoot someone as long as\u2014despite all the evidence to the contrary\u2014you believe that he or she poses a danger, you can murder that person in cold blood.

Kelly\u2019s alleged predatory behavior, providing the umpteenth reminder that the singer continues to hide in plain sight. In \u201cSurviving R. Kelly,\u201d former DJ Kitti Jones recounts her past relationship with Kelly and accuses him of physically abusing her, forcing her to have sex with other women, and urinating on her. During a particularly scary fight, she says, \u201cMy heart was just beating through my chest...He just turned into a monster.\u201d\n\nIt is an agonizing account of an abusive relationship, and it\u2019s not the only one out there. In a fairer world, R. Kelly should be rotting in a prison cell in a state of perpetual irritation that he\u2019ll never get to perform \u201cBump \u2018N Grind\u201d outside any venue not under the control of the Illinois Department of Corrections. No amount of \u201cgenius\u201d\u2014which has been long cited by fans who continue to monetarily support him in spite of a now decades-old accusations of inappropriate sexual relationships with minors\u2014can excuse anyone\u2019s predatory behavior.\n\nR. Kelly, his chocolate factory, his Zorro-inspired masks, his chitlin-play esque \u201cTrapped In The Closet\u201d series, his fake-ass Sam Cooke impersonations, and most of all, his incessant and at times antagonistic displays of overt sexuality in his music and accompanying imagery should have never happened, and the man behind it all should be rendered a pariah expelled from the pop cultural zeitgeist.\n\n\n\nInstead, in 2017, R. Kelly continues to thrive as an artist. What makes this all the more infuriating is that the Rolling Stone report comes at a moment in history in which powerful, predatory men are facing repercussions for their behavior.\n\n\n\nWhat will it take to get more of us to give a damn about R. Kelly\u2019s alleged crimes? The answer may lie in who his victims are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHarvey Weinstein may reportedly remain dedicated to making films in the future despite being marred in scandal and now presently under investigation for rape, but for all intents and purposes, he is done in Hollywood. Bill Cosby may or may not face prison time over allegations of rape, but his legacy is forever tarnished and he, a self-important moralizer to poor black people, has been exposed as a hypocrite. Moreover, if Page Six is correct that the comedian is taking $30 million loan against his Upper East Side townhouse to pay for his mounting legal bills as he prepares for retrial for sexual assault, his fortune is shrinking. Cosby\u2019s millions were built on a lie and used to obstruct justice and continue to violate women\u2019s autonomy: Let him die broke.\n\n\n\nWe also now know just how much sexual harassment permeated the workplace at Fox News. Reports of said harassment led to the ouster of the late Roger Ailes, who served as chairman and CEO of Fox News, and later, its biggest star, Bill O\u2019Reilly. In the case of O\u2019Reilly, who is actively seeking a return to television, we are still learning details about how willing Fox News was to look the other way at allegations of O\u2019Reilly\u2019s sexual harassment for the sake of ratings.\n\n\n\nOn Thursday, CNN reported that political analyst, author, and regular regurgitation of bullshit Mark Halperin sexually harassed and assaulted numerous women during his time as ABC News political director. Already, MSNBC has released a statement: \u201cWe find the story and the allegations very troubling. Mark Halperin is leaving his role as a contributor until the questions around his past conduct are fully understood.\u201d Time will likely not be kind to Halperin, who infamously referred to then-President Obama as a \u201cdick.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGood riddance.\n\nAnd yet, nothing has happened to R. Kelly despite similar reporting. This summer, Buzzfeed published a story that alleged Kelly has maintained a \u201csex cult.\u201d The gruesome details therein\u2014that he forces women to call him \u201cdaddy\u201d and controls every aspect of their lives, down to when they can urinate\u2014made the story go viral, but the tour went on and those who have continued to collaborate with him offered no comments on it. Shortly thereafter, Jezebel published an interview with another alleged former girlfriend who repeated some of the same accusations found in the Buzzfeed expose. The reporter behind the piece, Jim DeRogatis, has tried to warn the public about Kelly since his days as the pop music critic at the Chicago Sun-Times.\n\n\n\nR. Kelly has been particularly smug and open about his predatory antics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNone of that Kelly from touring\u2014with the likes of successful female artists such as Monica and LeToya Luckett on the tour bill. One skim of Ticketmaster reveals that Kelly has arena tour dates through the end of the year. Kelly also remains a fixture on the radio. And based on Sam Smith wearing a T-shirt with his face plastered on it, Kelly remains a figure whose reverence is expanding with future generations rather than rightfully dying. Worse, many of his fans continue to be willfully ignorant about the accusations leveled against him. Because if you are buying a ticket to see R. Kelly perform, you are choosing to align yourself with a predator and dancing along to him in total complicity.\n\n\n\nWhat will it take to get more of us to give a damn about R. Kelly\u2019s alleged crimes? The answer may lie in who his victims are.\n\nThe difference between Kelly and other powerful men like Weinstein and Ailes is that Kelly\u2019s accusers are primarily black girls and women. Black girls and women who are young or underage. Black girls and women who are poor or working class, particularly the ones involved in the cases DeRogatis investigated decades ago. Black girls and women who are not famous. It is also not easy for black girls and women of means and notoriety to earn the respect they deserve, so the burden on those without either to get people to care is even higher.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, Weinstein, no matter how powerful, could not match the celebrity of his accusers, which ranged from Mira Sorvino to Ashley Judd. Many of the women accusing Cosby of assault were white women; the most high-profile non-white accuser, legendary black model Beverly Johnson, was already famous. One can\u2019t be certain that it was all white women accusing Halperin and O\u2019Reilly of sexual misconduct and harassment respectively, but it is a reasonable assumption that most of them were, given the lack of diversity at mainstream media outlets. The same can be said of Megyn Kelly, a blond, white Fox News anchor and household name who spoke out against Ailes, effectively sealing his fate.\n\nOf course, R. Kelly isn\u2019t the only alleged predator thriving despite widespread rumors of abuse. Woody Allen continues to work with Hollywood\u2019s young actresses and veteran Oscar winners despite allegations that he molested Mia Farrow\u2019s adopted daughter, Dylan. Then there is the 45th president of the United States, the self-congratulating pussy grabber.\n\nBut R. Kelly has been particularly smug and open about his predatory antics. His accusations have followed him for 20 years and he\u2019s left not only a widely reported paper trail in legal settlements, but in interviews when asked about whether he liked teenager girls, answered, first asked for clarification on how young in age constituted a teen. He was openly married to a teenage Aaliyah in the 1990s. When Kelly was acquitted on 14 counts of child pornography, five jurors claimed the absence of testimony from the alleged victim served as \u201cbig handicap\u201d in the prosecutor\u2019s case\u2014a case that took prosecutors six years to get to trial.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe all know who R. Kelly really is. The question is whether he will he ever face any consequences. It may take a critical mass of victims to speak out, like in the cases of Cosby and Weinstein. But if the past is prologue, there is reason to worry. And even if Kelly finally faces the public banishment his accused behavior has commanded, it needn\u2019t ever be lost on us why it took so long to happen.", "keywords": ["r", "kelly", "girls", "predatory", "harvey", "sexual", "women", "fate", "particularly", "weinstein", "alleged", "black", "meet"], "polarity": 0.052174408014571946, "subjectivity": 0.4308380371904962},

Courtney was wanted on an assault warrant. Gaines was wanted on a failure-to-appear warrant that started over traffic tickets.\n\nPolice say they could hear people in the apartment, although no one answered the door. An officer gained a key to the apartment and opened the door, and Gaines reportedly pointed a shotgun at him. A tactical team was called. A seven-hour standoff ensued. Courtney grabbed a 1-year-old child and made a break for it. He was arrested and taken into custody. Gaines and her 5-year-old son stayed in the apartment. It all ended when police stormed the residence and shot and killed the 23-year-old mother and wounded her 5-year-old son.\n\nKorryn Gaines' death is a tragedy. Full stop.\n\nBut I don't believe she's a victim.\n\nBefore we go on, let me be clear: I am no police apologist. I believe that too many times in this country, racist police resort to aggressive tactics when policing black folk. I also believe that there is a systemic blue wall of brotherhood that looks a lot like the Ku Klux Klan. I still believe that N.W.A's \"F\u2014k tha Police\" is the most important political doctrine ever written because it captures the true essence of being othered in a heightened police state.\n\n\n\nF\u2014k the police Coming straight from the underground A young n\u2014ga got it bad cause I'm brown. And not the other color so police think they have the authority to kill a minority.\n\nSince Gaines' death, countless theories and videos have emerged like bread crumbs on an endless trail to make sense of what feels like a senseless death. I don\u2019t feel any closer to understanding this tragedy even as more information becomes available. But I can say this: Gaines' death has me completely conflicted about everything.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a firm supporter of the Movement for Black Lives, I don't know how an armed Gaines being gunned down by police fits into the unarmed narrative of senseless black death. Yes, her death feels like an avoidable tragedy (because it was), but it was also one that Gaines could have de-escalated. Am I upset that Gaines' son was shot in the melee? Absolutely! But I'm equally upset that Gaines put her son's life at risk.\n\nI don\u2019t think that Gaines needs to be a perfect victim in order to grieve the tragedy of her death, but I do wonder what recourse the police had. She was armed. A seven-hour standoff netted them nothing. She didn't answer the door and refused to give up her weapon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe know that she had a gun because she posted a video of herself loading a Mossberg 12-gauge pistol-grip pump shotgun while police were at her door.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, I don't know of another statement that encapsulates N.W.A's seminal classic more than the last few lines of her social media post, which read: \"Thought i was gon have to take out a [n\u2014ga] nd [sic] realized i had a bigger problem. [F\u2014k] it Let's dance, i got some rhythm.\"\n\nThat doesn't sound like the words of someone who was afraid of what was to come.\n\nDuring a May 2016 police stop, Gaines was clear, telling the officer, \"If you put your hands on me, you're going to have to murder me.\"\n\nLet's be clear about this: Gaines was not a victim of overaggressive policing; she was a young woman who declared that she was tired of being harassed by police she believed were targeting her. So she took up arms and stood her ground.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI do not advocate this form of rebellious citizenship, and we have to be clear about where we stand when we talk about policing our community. When we advocate for vigilante justice, we do a disservice to a nonviolent movement. When we champion vigilantism over structured government, we are headed toward chaos.\n\nI know that these facts are indisputable: Gaines said during a nonconfrontational police stop that she would have to be killed if police touched her. During the Aug. 1 police encounter, Gaines refused to answer the door or leave the apartment as police instructed. Gaines stayed in the apartment during a seven-hour negotiation with a loaded weapon and her 5-year-old son.\n\nI've heard the Cliven Bundy comparisons, and let me remind people of a few things: #YallQaeda took over the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. It wasn't a hostage situation. And, in the end, one person was killed and another was wounded during a shootout with police. People did die, and they didn't have to, either.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn truth, making Gaines a victim takes away her agency. It makes her helpless when she was anything but. She was a soldier who was willing to die for what she believed, even if the war was skewed.\n\nIs there a war between black people and police? At times, it can feel like it. But there is a thin line between protesting for equal rights under the law and taking up arms. This was a militia-style fight, and I don't think Gaines would want to be remembered as a helpless person. She fought for that freedom she believed in to her core.\n\nAs tragic as her death may be, I urge caution in taking up her fight. She was no Eric Garner, Alton Sterling, Philando Castille. She was not Sandra Bland or Rekia Boyd, and she doesn't need to be. Maybe it's the deaths of those unarmed people that pushed Gaines over the edge; that pushed her to take up arms and take up a fight she believed was just.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo act as if her fight was lost demeans her legacy. Even if I don't agree with Gaines' aggressive action, I know that she was tired, and I know what tired looks like.\n\nStephen A. Crockett Jr. is a senior editor at The Root.

Kelly\u2019s ex-girlfriends has come forward in a Rolling Stone article with new allegations of sexual, emotional and physical abuse against the R&B singer.\n\nKitti Jones, a former radio DJ, cataloged the entire dizzying, two-year relationship with the \u201cPied Piper\u201d of R&B to the magazine, describing how they met (at an after-party following his Dallas concert), his \u201ccourteous courtship\u201d of her, and the escalating incidents of abusive behavior that came to characterize their relationship.\n\nThe story follows a blockbuster BuzzFeed report from Jim DeRogatis, who has followed sexual abuse allegations against Robert Kelly for decades. That story details multiple claims that Kelly held women against their will in a \u201ccult.\u201d Jones was among DeRogatis\u2019 sources.\n\nBelow are some of the most troubling, brutal allegations from Jones, according to the report:\n\nOn meeting R. Kelly at a hotel for the first time:\n\n\u201cI got there before he did because he of course doesn\u2019t like to fly, so he\u2019s taking the bus,\u201d Jones says. She had sent Kelly \u201cracy photos\u201d while he was en route to the hotel and was excited to reunite face-to-face. As she waited in the hotel room for Kelly to arrive, she heard a knock at the door. \u201cHe brushed past me,\u201d Jones says. \u201cI\u2019m thinking we\u2019re going to hug or peck each other. But he plopped down on the couch and pulled out his penis and started pleasuring himself.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJones told Rolling Stone she was stunned by Kelly\u2019s audacity and said that if he had been \u201ca regular guy working at CVS\u201d she would have been furious, but she was entranced by months of communication and flirting. Still, looking back, she said, there were warning signs:\n\n\u201cI was attracted to him and was just like, \u2018Well, OK. Fine,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cMaybe he just has weird ways of getting off.\u201d The two had oral sex that weekend, with Kelly, according to Jones, saying things like, \u201cI gotta teach you how to be with me\u201d and \u201cI gotta train you.\u201d \u201cHe was like a drill sergeant even when he was pleasuring me,\u201d Jones says. \u201cHe was telling me how to bend my back or move my leg here. I\u2019m like, \u2018Why is he directing it like this?\u2019 It was very uncomfortable.\u201d\n\nOn how R. Kelly\u2019s behavior changed once she moved out to Chicago to be with him:\n\nAlmost instantly upon moving to Chicago, Jones says, Kelly began governing nearly every detail of her life, starting with the requirement that she wear baggy sweatpants whenever she went out and text near-constant updates on her whereabouts. (A source who knew Kelly confirmed the singer\u2019s demands on Jones to Rolling Stone.) Jones says she was forced to text either the singer or one of his employees for even the slightest request. (Sample text message: \u201cDaddy, I need to go to the restroom.\u201d)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the day Jones confronted him about the infamous tape that shows the singer allegedly urinating on a teenage girl:\n\nJones had been living with Kelly for less than a month when she claims the first instance of physical abuse occurred, in November 2011. Jones says that on a return trip to Dallas around Thanksgiving, she saw for the first time the video at the heart of his child-pornography trial and challenged Kelly on the phone about it. \u201cHe said, \u2018Bitch, don\u2019t you ever fucking accuse me of something like that,\u2019\u201d Jones says. \u201cHe never had spoken to me like that before.\u201d\n\n\n\nJones claims Kelly remained enraged when she flew back and met him at the airport. \u201cMy heart was just beating through my chest,\u201d she says. \u201cHe just turned into a monster. I blamed myself \u2018cause I was like, \u2018Maybe I shouldn\u2019t\u2019ve said anything.\u2019\u201d As they drove home, Jones says she repeatedly apologized while Kelly kicked her multiple times and delivered a series of open-handed slaps to her face. \u201cI was putting my hand over my face and telling him I was sorry,\u201d Jones says. \u201cHe would start kicking me, telling me I was a stupid bitch [and] don\u2019t ever get in his business.\u201d The next day, Jones says, the couple went shopping and neither spoke about the incident.\n\nOn how Kelly\u2019s manipulation escalated when Jones was moved into a home with two of Kelly\u2019s other girlfriends:\n\nThere were no locks on the doors, but cameras monitored every move and Kelly would punish the women for attempting to leave for any reason without permission. (The source who knew Kelly independently confirmed Kelly\u2019s rules with his girlfriends to Rolling Stone.) Kelly would frequently take away Jones\u2019 phone as punishment\u2014sometimes as long as two months\u2014cutting off her ability to request food or perform basic functions, according to Jones and the other source who knew him.\n\nTwo months into living at the studio, Jones says, Kelly began using starvation on her as punishment for not following his orders. Jones says the longest she went without food was two and a half days, though single days without a meal were not uncommon.\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn how the singer forced Jones to have sex with other female partners:\n\nKelly would frequently fly girls in for sex, says Jones, and order her and his other girlfriends to hook up with them. \u201cYou can\u2019t say no because you\u2019re going to get punished,\u201d she says. \u201cYou just become numb to what\u2019s happening. It\u2019s so traumatic the things that he makes you do to other people and to him.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe videotapes everything that he does, and sometimes he\u2019ll just make you watch what he\u2019s done to other girls or girls that he had be together,\u201d she adds. \u201cHe would masturbate to that and then have you give him oral sex while he\u2019s watching what he did with somebody else on his iPad.\u201d\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is arguably most disturbing about Jones\u2019 described relationship with Kelly is her self-admitted protectiveness of the singer, even after she said he routinely isolated her, demeaned her, starved her and forced her into nonconsensual sex acts. After Jones severed her romantic relationship with Kelly in 2013, she told Rolling Stone that she reached out to the singer after a tense video interview with the Huffington Post.\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018Oh, my God, poor thing,\u2019\u201d Jones told the magazine.\n\nNow, Jones says, she is coming forward with her story because she wants other women to speak up about abuse they\u2019ve suffered at Kelly\u2019s hands, and to encourage the public to take the decades of allegations seriously.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI want them to not be so dismissive towards the women that are speaking out,\u201d says Jones, who, Rolling Stone reports, is currently exploring her legal options against the singer.\n\nDespite the swirl of allegations that have followed Kelly throughout the career, there is currently no open criminal investigation against him.\n\n\n\nRead more at Rolling Stone.", "keywords": ["abuse", "r", "kelly", "disturbingabuse", "jones", "women", "rolling", "recentand", "kellys", "launched", "allegations", "stone", "singer", "report", "sex"], "polarity": -0.020709918736234536, "subjectivity": 0.42943452746084326},

The reason the police were there in the first place is still sketchy. Initially it was reported that the 23-year-old mother was being served a warrant for a failure to appear in court, and now news has come out that police were serving an arrest warrant. The police claim she pointed a shotgun at an officer during the initial encounter, which escalated the incident. While the story of exactly what happened is still unfolding, what we do know is this: Gaines was shot and killed during the incident, and her 5-year-old son was wounded.\n\nWhat's left behind is a social media puzzle of clues as to who Gaines may have been before her fatal encounter with police. Videos posted on social media show a woman who might have been a \u201csovereign citizen.\u201d It's important in this heightened police climate that we stay informed. While the waters of sovereign citizenship are murky, with the doctrine dating back to the 18th century, below is a brief synopsis of the movement that law-enforcement agencies have identified as one of the largest domestic terrorist threats in the U.S.\n\n\n\nWhat Is a Sovereign Citizen?\n\nA sovereign citizen is a person who holds complex anti-government beliefs and doesn't believe in government-ordered practices like paying taxes or registering a car with the state. Sovereigns also believe that by denouncing their citizenship, ripping up their Social Security card, and refusing to pay taxes or register their vehicle with the appropriate state, they are no longer ruled by federal law.\n\nJ.J. MacNab, who has studied the phenomenon for over a decade, told CBS that a sovereign citizen \"has a twisted sense of history and he thinks that people who lived in the 18th century were free of all legal constraints. And they want to return to that time now.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center notes that the majority of sovereign citizens are African American but that the origins are rooted in racist, anti-Semitic beliefs.\n\nSovereigns often destroy all forms of documentation, including driver's licenses, license plates, vehicle registration and Social Security numbers, and believe that in doing so, they are absolved from being under federal rule.\n\nMost have a skewed view of what the government can and cannot do and challenge those who impose what they consider to be unjust laws. They've been known to use archaic, and oftentimes misinterpretations of, laws to justify their position.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWas Korryn Gaines a Sovereign Citizen?\n\nPossibly. During a March traffic stop, which was recorded on video, an officer can be heard telling Gaines that she had cardboard signs for license plates. One cardboard sign reportedly had the words \"Free Traveler\" written on it. Sovereign citizens often refer to themselves as free travelers. The other had the following phrase written on it: \"Any government official who compromises this pursuit to happiness and right to travel, will be held criminally responsible and fined, as this is a natural right to freedom.\"\n\nSovereign citizens believe that the government not only is wrong in detaining them but also has acted with impunity because U.S. citizens are ignorant of their rights.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGaines can be heard stating that she doesn't \"follow their laws\" and repeatedly asks the officer for a delegation-of-authority order. If Gaines was, in fact, a sovereign citizen, then she would have believed that state and federal laws did not apply to her.\n\nIn a caption posted with her March arrest video, Gaines posted this:\n\n\n\nConstitutional Law is the only true law. In order to be granted the role as Law enforcement u must take an oath to uphold the Constitution and be granted a DOAO DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY ORDER. The police are not Law enforcement they are Policy enforcers and operate outside of the laws of the Constitution which would make them organized criminals. They enforce CORPORATE Law (to generate revenue, in others words to get money, however in this case they know that i know this nd this is them making trouble with me) which is not a true form of the law but so many of us have bended to their criminal ways. Not me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSovereign Citizens and Law Enforcement\n\nPolice sometimes stop sovereign citizens who believe that they are being harassed unjustly by uninformed officers. During a post after her March traffic stop, Gaines identified the police as \"kidnappers\" and noted that she was being \"held hostage\" while in police custody.\n\nSovereigns believe that judges, courts and police officers no longer have jurisdiction over them. They often consider police \"harassers\" and clog up the court system filing frivolous lawsuits citing archaic and, oftentimes, asinine statutes. This is sometimes referred to as \"paper terrorism.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStephen A. Crockett Jr. is a senior editor at The Root.

Her husband called the police during an argument, according to the lawsuit filed this week in U.S. District Court. In the lawsuit, it is acknowledged that McNeil had been drinking at the time.\n\nThings appear to have gone awry, however, at the Branch County Jail, where police officers and McNeil can be seen on video inside the secured entrance area of the jail. In the video, an officer, identified as Lewis Eastmead, can be seen holding McNeil, who is handcuffed against a wall, her face pressed against the structure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEastmead appears to use all his body weight to press McNeil into the wall. McNeil yells at the officer, who then drags her from the wall and slams her, face-first, on the ground, basically landing on top of her. At least five other officers were around at the time, standing nearby.\n\n\u201cI told you to relax,\u201d Eastmead can be heard yelling while kneeling on McNeil\u2019s back as she lay unmoving on the ground.\n\nAccording to the Daily Reporter, the lawsuit claims that \u201cOfficer Eastmead then continued to yell at her to be quiet even though she was unconscious and bleeding profusely from her head. ... He did however yell at her lifeless body to \u2018roll over!\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe lawsuit also accuses Officers Matt Schoenauer and Suleiman Sumbal, who were in the jail entrance area throughout the incident, of failing to protect McNeil during the incident.\n\nWhen the officer rolls McNeil over, a pool of blood is revealed under McNeil\u2019s head, the video shows. Her handcuffs are eventually removed, while another officer checks for her pulse.\n\nAccording to McNeil attorney Radner, McNeil had to be taken to the hospital, where she received 17 stitches for a cut over her eye. She also suffered from a concussion, the lawyer said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe lawsuit further claims that after the fact, the officer and two others lied about what occurred on police reports (which seems like a pretty stupid thing to do, considering that they were taped). Also, according to the lawsuit, \u201cthe reports accused McNeil of being \u2018combative\u2019 and \u2018actively resisting\u2019 arrest before she fell to the ground.\u201d (All on her own?)\n\nIn addition to excessive force, the lawsuit claims unreasonable seizure, abuse of process and malicious prosecution. Eastmead and some dozen other officers and supervisors, including those who witnessed the encounter, have been named as defendants.\n\nThe lawsuit is seeking at least $75,000 in damages.\n\nMcNeil, for her part, was charged with domestic violence and resisting a police officer. She pleaded no contest to domestic violence, while officials dropped the resisting arrest charge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe lawsuit claims that she was charged with a felony count of resisting a police officer only to justify the officer\u2019s brutal use of force and to pressure her into taking a plea bargain.\n\nRadner said that McNeil has no recollection of what happened at the jail.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead more at the Detroit Free Press and the Daily Reporter.", "keywords": ["jail", "thuglike", "sues", "michigan", "woman", "lawsuit", "officers", "claims", "wall", "video", "mcneil", "eastmead", "brutal", "arrest", "resisting", "conduct", "officer"], "polarity": -0.10087719298245612, "subjectivity": 0.4916666666666667},

Dean Worthington told WCMH-TV, explaining that use of force depends on the behavior of the suspect at the time of the arrest. \u201cThat\u2019s part of our use-of-force continuum, and it all depends on what the behavior of the suspect is at the time. Certainly, we don\u2019t want to go out there and punch citizens of our city, but we have the authority, we have the responsibility to arrest people, and sometimes arrests can be ugly.\u201d\n\nOf course, never missing an opportunity, the police had to bring up Davis\u2019 apparent criminal record, which includes charges of resisting arrest and assault.

I\u2019ve also permanently banned all R. Kelly music from my life. I also believe that some police are racist and allow that racism to decide how they are going to handle a situation involving African Americans before they\u2019ve even encountered them.\n\nAs such, I believe that kneeling during the national anthem is not only the righteous thing for NFL players to do but is also the morally just thing to do. I understand that many African Americans don\u2019t share my view; in fact, the one thing we can all agree on is that when it comes to protesting, we don\u2019t all agree. So I\u2019ve compiled a list of 10 things that I know all black people will protest.\n\n\n\n1. No Altering the Menu at Starbucks\n\nWe love to customize shit. Even noncustomizable shit\u2014it doesn\u2019t matter. Cars, teeth, nails, hair, skin\u2014we will customize the fuck out of it. And nothing is more customizable than a Starbucks drink order.\n\nNot being allowed to walk into a Starbucks and order a \u201ctallande* double-whip, no-foam mochaccino with unicorn sprinkles and elf tears, stirred with the ivory tusk of a baby elephant\u201d will turn black America upside down.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n*A tallande is where you cut a tall cup in half and staple it to the top of grande cup. And yes, it\u2019s still smaller than a venti.\n\n2. No Child Tax Credit\n\nTax season is arguably the flossiest season of all time. We Birdman hand-rub in anticipation of tax season, and that nice little Child Tax Credit bump is already planned into everyone\u2019s budget. Does it offset the cost of having a child? Hell no, but once it hits, you know you can finally make that dermatologist appointment and get the extra skin-care products that they keep in the locked glass case at CVS. Buying fancy skin care and making a dermatology appointment is balling to people of a certain age.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. Popeyes Decides to Never Bring Back the $5 Big Box\n\nBlack people love to back away from chicken. In fact, just seeing this as a protest topic has made some black folks cringe. It\u2019s a cultural embarrassment, and in truth, we shouldn\u2019t love chicken so much, but we do. And this feels like a safe space to admit it. You know what else we love as much as chicken? Discounts. So when Popeyes has the $5 Big Box, we send out group texts letting each other know. Let Popeyes try and shut this down and watch how quickly we mobilize.\n\n4. A Nationwide Shortage of Talenti Gelato\n\nBlack people love fancy ice cream, and it doesn\u2019t get much fancier than this. I have often said that if you want me to be there, then you have to have Talenti gelato. I have left parties early because they didn\u2019t have it. On the promise of Talenti gelato, I will protest while holding a tiki torch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. The Lottery Stops the Three- and Four-Digit Number\n\nI don\u2019t know anyone who has ever hit the number. Wait, I take that back\u2014my dad once hit the number, and it wasn\u2019t so much that he hit the number as it was the story of how the number came to him. Black people dream numbers. Family members who have passed to the other side send numbers back in dreams. My dad believes to this day that he didn\u2019t hit the number so much as it was destined for him to hit the number. He dreamed it and played it and won a pretty good amount of money. \u201cThe numbers\u201d are a staple in the black community, and taking it away would literally be like taking the black community\u2019s dreams. It\u2019s low-level investing, and stopping it would cause a nationwide black panic.\n\n6. The Disappearance of the Shirtless Snake Guy\n\nSince I was a boy, the shirtless snake guy has been a part of my collective memory. He was at every health care expo, Taste of the City, 8th Street Festival, Beach Week. If there was a monument to universal blackness, it would be a shirtless muscular black man with a snake around his neck or arm. He\u2019s a fixture at all black outdoor universal summer events, and his disappearance would cause mass hysteria in the black community because for once, we\u2019d all finally agree that without him, there is a glitch in the matrix.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. No More Macy\u2019s Coupons\n\nLook, I don\u2019t want to stereotype, but here comes some crazy-big stereotyping: Black women love Macy\u2019s. Older black women would marry Macy\u2019s if they could. My mom does all her Christmas shopping at Macy\u2019s, and on the off chance that she couldn\u2019t find something for one of us at Macy\u2019s, then you know what we\u2019re getting for Christmas? That\u2019s right, you guessed it: a Macy\u2019s gift card.\n\nAs such, black women live for the coupons that come in the mail and the ones online.

A guest who is directly responsible for changing the world as we know it. A guest who helped influence and alter the musical landscape. A guest who was directly responsible for bringing Beyonc\u00e9 into existence.\n\nI don't believe in throwing anyone under the bus. The Pod Squad is a three-person leaderless team, so we have nothing if we don't support one another. But someone whose name rhymes with Besha Ballahan totally dropped the ball, and we lost our guest. It's not her fault, really, except it's absolutely her fault. Don't worry, UV-ers\u2014she's working tirelessly to get our special guest back!\n\nWhat does any of this mean to our listeners? Well, nothing except that you got an extra week of Stephen A.

I had to go to a place worse than both bin Laden's cave and Trump's house. I had to go to the dentist, which left Patti LaDanielle to run the show. She even sings the theme song!\n\nWith Yesha \"I like meats\" Callahan as her co-pilot, it didn\u2019t take long for the jokes about me living with my mother to commence. The jokes move from living at home to the one room in your mama's house you couldn't go in, to not using the good china, to paper-plate holders, to natural hair, to brown M&M's being bad for women's uteruses (uteri?). Trust me, this was all done seamlessly, since we are professionals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd while we would like to be a break from the seriousness of life, we can't avoid heavy topics entirely. So this week's look at the news starts with the tragic death of Korryn Gaines, the Baltimore mother who was shot and killed by police. Although the story is still unfolding, we take a hard look at the videotaped interactions the 23-year-old had with the police prior to her death. Because of some of the controversial statements Gaines made during a traffic stop, we debate ideologies around being Hotep vs. being woke.\n\nAfter a brief break (which could be filled with ads from sponsors; yes, we are looking at you, Ford Motor Co.), we move to Malia Obama and \"the three-second twerk heard round the world.\" We debate whether the first child has rhythm and if she got in trouble once she got home.\n\nI wish the next segment was a joke, but unfortunately it's not: Charles Barkley has a new show on race relations. I do a stellar Barkley impersonation that Patti LaDanielle attempts to match. Yesha believes she sounds like Jesse Jackson. We all hope the worst for Mr. Barkley's show, except we don't.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe don't stop there, but I can't give you all the goods or else you won't listen to the show. Speaking of listeners (shameless plug to big-up the hard work we do to keep this show fresh and entertaining), last week's show was our biggest yet! We feel like we're on to something, and more importantly, the people, you people\u2014and we don't mean this in a racist Trump way\u2014like us!

The fact that when I log on to the internet and find my way through the Twittersphere, I see black men blaming black women like Gaines\u2014the same black women who defend us even to their detriment\u2014hurts like hell.\n\nAlthough men often remain silent about the violence black women face, black women continually fight for and defend black men. How often do we organize national marches for black women killed by police? Let\u2019s face it: Black women rarely receive respect in movement-building spaces, including online mechanisms, despite always being front and center in ongoing fights against police brutality. It\u2019s quite terrifying to have anyone think that women like Gaines are the causes of their own deaths. And having that cruel argument come from black men adds insult to injury.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t escape me that the world needs more people like Gaines: women who are bold, women who don\u2019t want to die with their hands up because they understand that they can be shot anyhow, and women who are about transformative justice. Gaines recognized that none of this could be done with concession. This, coupled with the understanding that black America doesn\u2019t need to sanitize Gaines\u2019 life for us to #SayHerName, is critical. Gaines fought (and fought hard), and she wanted to ensure that her son understood not to fear police. But still, none of this means she deserved to die.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFurther, what we know is that if Gaines had been white, she would have lived. The main argument circulating is that \u201cshe asked to die when she pointed the gun at police.\u201d Assuming she actually pointed a gun, we must understand that her blackness is what got her killed, not a rifle.\n\nIn the past five years, there have been numerous occasions when white people have pointed guns at police officers and have remained alive\u2014and, in some instances, have kept their firearms. E.J. Watson, for example, was arrested in October of 2015 for waving a loaded gun on the road, and when the police came, he did not put it down. He\u2019s still living. And this year, the police approached a vehicle of Jed Frazier, a white man, as he pulled a handgun from his coat pocket and pointed it at police. He\u2019s not dead.\n\nWhile we may not know too much about Gaines, we do know police. We do know that we need to continue to #SayHerName if black women are to mean anything to us and our movements.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd we know that the body count of black women like Gaines who are executed by police and blamed for their own blood will continue to rise as long as we are silent about their pain, cowardly co-signing the lie that they deserved it.", "keywords": ["perfect", "gaines", "sayhername", "way", "women", "silent", "doesnt", "know", "killed", "white", "men", "pointed", "need", "black", "korryn"], "polarity": -0.02685969868173258, "subjectivity": 0.38024952919020716},

The video, which was not-so-coincidentally released after Brailsford\u2019s acquittal, sparked outrage across the nation after Brailsford was found not guilty of second-degree murder in the shooting death of Texas dad Daniel Shaver in the hallway of a La Quinta Inn & Suites, Newsweek reports.\n\nThe horror of what Shaver experienced that night a year ago was only fully realized after the video was released. Brailsford forced the 26-year-old father\u2014who was audibly terrified and could be heard crying, saying that he did not want to die\u2014to crawl toward him before firing five bullets and killing him.\n\nMany on social media who have seen the video have called it an outright \u201cexecution\u201d and \u201cmurder.\u201d Attorneys in the case also argued that Brailsford murdered Shaver \u201cexecution\u201d style.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis is one of the most disturbing things I have ever seen, not for the brutality of the shooting itself, but for the sadism of the cop who is getting off on humiliating a pliant & obedient suspect before ultimately shooting him,\u201d Omar Baddar, deputy director of the Arab American Institute, tweeted.\n\nShaver\u2019s deadly encounter with Brailsford began on Jan. 16, 2016, after police officers responded to a call about someone pointing a gun at the window of the hotel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShaver was visiting Mesa, Ariz., from Texas for his pest-control job. He was unarmed when police found him; however, witnesses said that he had showed off a pellet gun to two guests when he had met them earlier in the night.\n\nThe video shows how the situation rapidly declined from there.\n\nShaver exits his hotel room, only to see several officers waiting on him. Brailsford\u2019s AR-15 was already pointed at him. Another officer, identified as Sgt. Charles Langley, could be heard on the video telling Shaver to \u201cget on the ground.\u201d Langley could also be heard telling Shaver that if he moves, he will get shot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA shaken Shaver is sobbing and trying to cooperate with officers, saying, \u201cPlease don\u2019t shoot me ... I\u2019m trying to do what you tell me,\u201d before Langley orders him to crawl toward him (why officers didn\u2019t approach Shaver and cuff him while he was on the ground is beyond me).\n\nAs he\u2019s crawling, Shaver\u2019s hand appears to reach behind his back before Brailsford opens fire, shooting him five times with the semi-automatic rifle.\n\nPolice reports from the incident claimed that the movement Shaver made was \u201ca very similar motion to someone drawing a pistol,\u201d the BBC notes. However, some said that Shaver\u2019s pants had fallen and he was trying to adjust them when he was shot, noting that his movement \u201cwas also consistent with attempting to pull his shorts up as they were falling off ... no other purposes for this movement appear to be viable.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, no weapon was found near Shaver.

But since we here at The Glow Up sit at the intersection of Fashion Week and Black History Month (and Wakanda, obvi), we couldn\u2019t help noticing another trend rising the past few seasons: a surge in blackness-branded clothing we haven\u2019t seen since the early \u201990s (more on that trend to come).\n\n\n\nWhat was really striking to us was the re-emergence of our two primary civil rights icons, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr., as the focus of two clothing lines this season: the Malcolm X Legacy collection, which debuted at Harlem Fashion Week 2018, and recent releases from New York-based skateboarding brand Supreme, whose latest lookbook features clothing emblazoned with MLK\u2019s visage and most famous phrases: \u201cI have a dream\u201d and \u201cWe shall overcome.\u201d\n\nSuffice it to say, reviews on the much-better-known Supreme collection were mixed, especially among The Root crew. Our internal\u2014and anonymous\u2014staff discussions went something like this:\n\n\u201cThis is ridiculous. The King family is a mess for authorizing this.\u201d \u201cCash grab.\u201d \u201cMy beef with it is ... why is it so hideous? It looks like some shit you\u2019d see for sale on the side of the road ... or at a swamp meet.\u201d [Editor\u2019s note: Yes, she meant \u201cswamp.\u201d] \u201cThere will be no Supreme-bashing on my watch ... aka my favorite brand right now. Although I must admit that this morning\u2019s lookbook was sad, and the MLK hoodie was one of the better pieces in a sad way. ... Supreme has honored several blacks in the past, including the great Pam Grier ... Sade, Muhammad Ali, KRS-One, Malcolm X ... MLK fits that mold, even if that all-over print sweatshirt is fugazi.\u201d \u201cThe Sade was fresh. This was a mess. It looked like something I\u2019d be forced to buy if I caught a chill at Jazz Fest ... and I\u2019d stay cold.\u201d \u201cI think MLK on the arms was overkill. Never put MLK on the arms.\u201d \u201cThat sweatshirt was all the velvet paintings and airbrushed backdrops of MLK that ever were.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOK. So that release was considered less than \u201csupreme\u201d around these parts. But not to be outdone, the jewel in the crown that was 2018 Harlem Fashion Week was the debut of the Malcolm X Legacy collection, co-helmed by the six daughters of Malcolm X and Betty Shabazz\u2014Qubilah, Attallah, Ilyasah, Malikah, Gamilah and Malaak Shabazz. Instead of simply licensing their father\u2019s words and image to an existing brand, the Shabazz sisters teamed up with tech company Hingeto and emerging designer Yvonne Jewnell to collaborate on a clothing line that pays homage to their father\u2019s legacy.\n\nThe contemporary urbanwear line features clothing inspired by the 12 principles of Malcolm X, which stressed the importance of human rights, education, economic independence, cultural pride and justice. The Shabazz sisters created the collection in hopes of inspiring a younger generation of activists to follow in their father\u2019s steps.\n\nThe Glow Up\u2019s editorial team (supermodel Veronica Webb and myself) had the pleasure of being front row at the debut of the Malcolm X Legacy collection at the inaugural event of Harlem Fashion Week on Feb. 4, a sold-out runway presentation at the gorgeous Museum of the City of New York. We can vouch for the fact that these are definitely clothes for a new generation of Malcolm X followers\u2014fresh, funky, fashion-forward and sexier than expected.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd while we both enjoyed the presentation, we\u2019ll let you judge for yourselves this round.

Kelly\u2014specifically, the support of him, the defense of him and the wagons circling around him\u2014from most other notable moral quandaries is the lack of any sort of reasonable justification for any continued Kelly-centric advocacy or patronage. For instance, it\u2019s no secret now that Chick-fil-A has donated considerable resources to fight against marriage equality. But when you actually walk past a Chick-fil-A in a mall food court, and you\u2019re greeted by the preternaturally peppy and kind cashiers and managers (some of whom might be gay or trans themselves), perhaps you can talk yourself into a Smokehouse BBQ Bacon Sandwich. This doesn\u2019t make that decision right. But a reasonable justification does exist.\n\nThere are no such excuses with R. Kelly\u2014no opportunities to forget that he is exactly who he is. His alleged criminality and sexual deviance have been corroborated by numerous people\u2014including men and women who\u2019ve lived in Chicago and have either witnessed Kelly stalking and preying on high-school-age girls or have actually been one of the young girls who caught his eye. Jim DeRogatis has made it his personal mission to descend as far down the R. Kelly rabbit hole as he can go, unlocking new terrors with each stage:\n\nOver the next seven months, Pace says she had sex with Kelly repeatedly, a claim she would later repeat during her settlement process. Without asking her permission, Kelly filmed most of the encounters on his iPhone or a video camera on a tripod, Pace says and a settlement draft reiterates. \u201cI had to call him \u2018daddy,\u2019 and he would call me \u2018baby.\u2019 He wanted me to have two pigtails, and I had to go out and find little schoolgirl outfits.\u201d If Kelly was previously unaware of Pace\u2019s age, she says she told him for certain that she was 16 on July 17, 2009, a claim she also made in the aforementioned documents. \u201cI gave him my state ID,\u201d she says. She recalls that Kelly told her things were fine, but that she should tell anyone who asked that she was 19, and act like she was 25. Pace says that she started spending weekends with Kelly at his Olympia Fields home. While she was in the mansion, she says, she had to follow Kelly\u2019s \u201crules,\u201d which included dressing in baggy clothes, turning over her phone, and asking permission to shower, eat, go to the bathroom, and leave the property. If she broke the rules, she says, she was mentally and physically abused. \u201cAt the time, I didn\u2019t know what I liked, honestly,\u201d Pace says, explaining why she complied. \u201cI just knew that I liked his music, so I was pretty much accepting of anything that came with him at the time.\u201d\n\nAlthough the name \u201cJerhonda Pace\u201d might be new, nothing she\u2019s saying about R. Kelly is particularly novel. And I\u2019m sure most of those who\u2019ve defended him and defended their continued fandom before will continue to. Because \u201cthose girls were fast.\u201d And also because of the distinction between R. Kelly the man and R. Kelly the artist.\n\nSeveral people, including DeRogatis, have written and commented on the abject wrongness of believing those girls \u201cknew what they were doing,\u201d and what the continued cultural embrace and patronage of R. Kelly says about our feelings about black women and girls, and whether we collectively believe they deserve protection and care. (We don\u2019t.)\n\nBut some of those who believe in the separation between the art and the man are still able to possess a convenient level of cognitive dissonance, allowing them to distill the musical parts of him away from his madness. But that doesn\u2019t exist, either. The separation between the two is mythical: a fabrication invented by those who wish to pretend that R. Kelly\u2019s musical catalog isn\u2019t also filled with both reminders and taunts of his alleged sex crimes. The title of the hit he wrote for Aaliyah\u2014his eventual teenage wife\u2014was \u201cAge Ain\u2019t Nothing but a Number.\u201d His studio is named the Chocolate Factory. He coined himself the Pied Piper of R&B.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith that knowledge, it\u2019s impossible to listen to \u201cIt Seems Like You\u2019re Ready\u201d and not know exactly what he\u2019s talking about. There\u2019s no space to even begin to forget who is he because he doesn\u2019t allow for any. He wants us to know. He\u2019s a bank robber who takes selfies with the security cameras.\n\nThere really just isn\u2019t much left to say to those who remain unswayed. He\u2019s been this way for two decades now and seems to be getting better at it. I don\u2019t know how to make someone know that they should care about what he\u2019s allegedly done, and how their continued defense supports and encourages the reality that we don\u2019t give a shit about black women and girls.

One (Korryn Gaines) was shot and killed by police officers during an alleged stand-off. Her five-year-old son was also shot. He is expected to survive.\n\nAnother (Joyce Quaweay) was stripped naked, handcuffed to a bench, and beaten to death by her boyfriend (Aaron Wright). Wright was assisted by his best friend (Marquis Robinson), who helped restrain Quaweay. Both men were former Temple University police officers. Also present were the children Quaweay and Wright had together, a two-year-old and a 10-month-old. One can only shudder at the thought of how brutal (and long) that beating must have been if it resulted in her death.\n\nNaturally, most of the reactions to these stories \u2014 at least the reactions I read \u2014 possessed the type of sadness and outrage you'd anticipate accompanying such tragic news.\n\nThere was also a collective exasperation, and a sadness and an outrage specifically derived from that exasperation. But this specific exasperation wasn't necessarily due to the acts themselves. It came from a frustration about the reactions to these acts.\n\nIn Gaines's case, this frustration stemmed from the observation many Black women (and some Black men) made that Gaines didn't seem to receive the same immediate benefit of the doubt and support from Black men that Black men killed by police always seem to. In Quaweay's case, the frustration stemmed from an acknowledgement of the role toxic patriarchy played in her death, and the reluctance of (some) Black men to acknowledge that it even exists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTogether, both of these frustrations and exasperations speak to a larger and painstakingly pervasive and consistent theme. That America is a uniquely dangerous place for Black women. Even more dangerous than it is for Black men. And that far too few people \u2014 far too few Black men, specifically \u2014 care to accept and acknowledge this.\n\nNow, I can cite myriad statistics and studies to express why this - that America is a uniquely dangerous place for Black women \u2014 is true. Proof is not very difficult to find. Articulating the reasonings behind the disconnect between the general accepted narrative and the reality, however, is a bit more complex. So complex that the best way for me to make some sense of it is to get personal; for me to explain why this disconnect existed within me too.\n\nAs long as I can remember being aware of race, racism, and the type of violence (both racial and general) that's featured in the news, Black men have been the faces of it. When learning at home and in school about the fight for civil rights, while I was taught that while Black women and girls definitely played a prominent role in that battle, it was Black men like Martin Luther King and Malcolm X and Medger Evers who were assassinated and martyred. It was Black boys like Emmett Till who were murdered by White men; Black men like Jesse Washington who were lynched.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd as a teen in the 90s, when police-involved and gang/drug-related violence dominated our news, Black men were the faces of that too. It was Black men like Rodney King who became national stories after being beaten by the police, and Black men like Jonny Gammage who were killed by them. It was (mostly) Black men killed in drive-bys and neighborhood feuds; in gang wars and tragic miscommunications. It was a Black male \u2014 a star football player named Dorian Reid \u2014 who was murdered my sophomore year of high school; an act that led to Peabody High School shutting down for an entire week. The people I graduated high school with who were murdered within a couple years of graduation? All Black males. One of whom was a friend killed by another one of my friends, also a Black male. As a young adult teaching at Wilkinsburg High School, it was Black boys like Chandler Thompson and Steven Tibbs \u2014 both of whom sat in my classroom \u2014 who were killed. It was Black men like my friend Kenneth Alford Jr (who everyone knew as \"Stubbo\") who were killed as a result of senseless shit like mistaken identity. And Black men like Amir Allen, who came to a birthday slumber party my parents threw for me when I was 11, serving life sentences in prison today for killing another Black man.\n\nStatistics \u2014 murder rates and incarceration rates, specifically \u2014 and the stories and news segments these statistics existed in reflected this idea of Black men existing as the most likely victims of violence and racism. Of course, Black women and girls were victimized by racial violence and murdered too. I was aware of historically prominent stories like the four little girls in Birmingham. And stories that weren't as nationally prominent, but still resonated with me, like the circumstances surrounding 17-year-old Cynthia Wiggins's death in a Buffalo suburb in 1995. And of the several students I taught who had been murdered, one (18-year-old Richiena Porter) was a Black girl.\n\nBut these instances were generally treated as anomalies \u2014 things that generally just didn't happen to Black women very often \u2014 so I believed them to be. And internalized that. And with this internalization came the idea that, when thinking of the dangers that Black people are disproportionately affected by, murder rates and incarceration rates were the ones that mattered most.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut while we (Black men) are more likely to get murdered or face imprisonment than Black women are, each still happens to Black women at very high rates. And the number of Black men actually affected by this is still considerably lower than the number of Black women victimized by the types of violence that doesn't always make the news and doesn't always have extensive data collected on. Namely, sexual assaults and partner-related violence.\n\nNow, it's not very difficult to conclude why (some) Black men might wish to minimize the existence and effect of this type of violence. Instead of allowing us (Black men) to exist as the primary victims, we have to share that status and also accept that, in regards to the violence Black women face, we're the primary victimizers. \"Fighting the Power\" is a hollow concept if you just want to switch from a White male patriarchy to a Black male one. Accepting that is a very difficult pill to swallow. Especially after decades of considering yourself uniquely endangered.\n\nBut with me, specifically, something else happened. Something that I suspect happened (and continues to happen) with other Black men. Something that I know will sound awkward reading, because I'm still not quite sure how to articulate it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI've been aware of the dangers specific to women. But it took years for me to understand it as pervasive. Not because I didn't want to, but because it just wasn't real to me. If you're a person (like me) who never witnessed this type of violence in the home or his family, and never committed any acts of violence or abuse \u2014 physical, sexual, or emotional \u2014 towards women, there's a good chance you've never actually seen it. You've read about it, seen movies about it, and perhaps even heard stories about it, but its difficult to recognize something as pervasive if it doesn't seem to exist in your life.\n\nOf course, doesn't \"seem\" to exist is an important distinction here. If half of women have been victimized in this way at some point in their lives, it stands to reason that half of my homegirls, female classmates, girlfriends, female work colleagues, and female family members have been too. It definitely existed, despite my ignorance to it.\n\nBut it didn't become real to me until two things happened. First, three separate women I've known as an adult confided in me about being assaulted \u2014 something (the confiding) that never happened to me before. Each of these were women I wouldn't have guessed had something like that happen to them, which reinforced the pervasiveness and the idea that it can happen to anyone. And also forced me to acknowledge some problematic and inaccurate thoughts about what \"victims\" looked and acted like.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut also, to be quite honest, the internet happened. Namely personal blogs and digital magazines and places like Twitter and Facebook and Tumblr. Before the internet, there just weren't this many first-person stories available for public consumption. And definitely not as much easily searchable data. But now, for anyone with a wifi connect or even a smart phone, there's no excuse to not at least be aware.

Carter\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 reads like a list of iconic favorites from contemporary black cinema. In the 30 years since her first film, Spike Lee\u2019s 1988 hit, School Daze, the Oscar- and Emmy-nominated costume designer has amassed more than 60 film and television credits, including I\u2019m Gonna Git You Sucka (1988); Do the Right Thing (1989); Mo\u2019 Better Blues (1990); House Party 2 (1991); Jungle Fever (1991); The Five Heartbeats (1991); Malcolm X (1992); What\u2019s Love Got to Do With It (1993); Crooklyn (1994); Clockers (1995); B*A*P*S (1997); Rosewood (1997); Amistad (1997); Love & Basketball (2000); Shaft (2000); Bamboozled (2000); Black Dynamite (2009); Sparkle (2012); The Butler (2013); Selma (2014) and Marshall (2017), not to mention Being Mary Jane and the recent reboot of Roots (2016).\n\nNow Carter is stunning us once again with her work in the most anticipated film of the year, Black Panther, her 40th film and first superhero narrative (unless you count Malcolm X). The Glow Up was blessed with the opportunity to speak with her during the flurry of publicity for this groundbreaking film while she took a rare timeout in Cape Town, South Africa. It proved a fitting setting to discuss how she helped create the fictional African country of Wakanda, and how it feels to quietly be one of the architects of black cultural collective consciousness. Ever humble, the now legendary designer told us:\n\nI always felt a responsibility to be authentic and real with depicting the culture. ... You look at enough research, you know the people. They\u2019re your relatives, they\u2019re your family. And so, collectively, when [I] look at my work, I just feel proud that I had some consistency with my approach to all of them. There was never one that I felt wasn\u2019t important for us to learn from. I was challenged each time to really get it right. ... That\u2019s kind of been my journey. And so when I look back at everything, I feel a sense of accomplishment and pride that Black Panther has kind of brought me full circle. I feel like I traveled from slavery with Roots and Amistad. And I went through the Depression with Rosewood in the \u201920s. I did Selma in the \u201950s. With Malcolm X, it was the \u201920s all the way through the \u201960s, and then I got a little \u201970s here and there with some funny ones like Black Dynamite. And then Black Panther came along, and now I\u2019m circling right back to Africa. So I actually feel like I closed the circle a little bit ... and I think they all helped to connect African history and African-American history. I\u2019m hoping for that.\n\nCarter, who has made history of her own as the first African American to be nominated for an Academy Award in costume design\u2014first for Malcolm X and again for Amistad\u2014ventured into new territory for her first Marvel film. In a stroke of luck, she learned she\u2019d gotten the job while working on Marshall, the Thurgood Marshall biopic starring future T\u2019Challa, Chadwick Boseman, directed by Black Panther comic writer Reginald Hudlin.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m like, you know how lucky is this? I get to study [Chadwick\u2019s] body; I get to ask Reggie questions about the Black Panther concept,\u201d Carter said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut even that recon couldn\u2019t fully prepare Carter for the Marvel experience, working with a team of five illustrators and a huge crew to bring the citizens of Wakanda to life. It was also the first time she had to design with movie merchandise in mind\u2014including action figures\u2014which meant that unlike Carter\u2019s previous work, many of the major costumes, like T\u2019Challa\u2019s iconic suit, were already well-defined. Instead, her role was to bring authenticity to characters that the fans of Black Panther have previously known only as illustrations, as she told The Glow Up: \u201cOnce I got the framework, we did a lot of experimentation. ... It\u2019s kind of like they gave me a coloring book and a big box of crayons.\u201d\n\nThat experimentation involved extensive research by Carter\u2019s team of four, exploring the ancient peoples of Africa\u2014including the Zulu, Maasai, Himba, Xhosa and the Turkana, which inspired the beautiful beading and neckpieces of the Dora Milaje. (Notably, Carter tries to steer clear of the word \u201ctribe\u201d because of its colonialist overtones, preferring to simply call each group of people by its name.)\n\nIn doing so, her team divided Wakanda into districts, according to a \u201cbible\u201d of sorts composed by director Ryan Coogler and production designer Hannah Beachler, that outlined both the story and layout of the fictional country. Said Carter:\n\nIt was an incredible piece of work; it was an incredible notebook that really forged us all so far ahead, because we were all working from the same nucleus ... there\u2019s different [communities] of Wakanda, and that bible that they did really outlined what parts of Wakanda were what. [For example] if you take any city, like New York, and you divide it by, you know, midtown, Brooklyn, the Village, NYU area, uptown, Columbia, Harlem, you kind of have a good sense of how Wakanda is broken up, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to Carter\u2019s core team, she also employed locals in South Africa and Ghana to search out antiques that would inspire the handmade feel she strongly felt Black Panther\u2019s costumes needed to have. Following Coogler\u2019s request that even the armor of the Dora Milaje feel like jewelry, Carter also brought on board friend and jeweler Douriean, who specializes in Afrofuturistic, hand-tooled, hand-hammered pieces, many of which have been worn by cast members during the film\u2019s premieres and press. Douriean is also the creator of Black Panther\u2019s officially licensed line of jewelry.\n\nAnd while Carter doesn\u2019t describe the experience as a seamless one, she credits Marvel for helping her realize the vision; even when some of the challenges of bringing Wakanda to life proved daunting:\n\nI had the greatest support from Marvel. The head executives, they never wavered. I never, ever felt\u2014and you know, every costume designer has at some point on a show felt like, \u201cThey\u2019re going to fire me, I know it. I\u2019m going to be fired tonight.\u201d We all go through that. And even though I may have had those thoughts, they were few and far between because I felt like I was supported 100 percent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney 1 / 15\n\nCarter is no stranger to making even the improbable possible; in her days as a student at Hampton University, she created a costume-design curriculum for herself after finding that there was nothing available to foster her budding talent. After graduation and a few opera-company internships, her HBCU experience and ingenuity came in handy when a chance meeting with director Spike Lee led to her first film, the now classic School Daze. It was the first of 14 films they\u2019d make together.\n\nBut even if she\u2019d do it all again, would she advise others to follow in her footsteps? She told The Glow Up: \u201cWell, don\u2019t do what I did, because I don\u2019t think it works today. I think that there\u2019s more avenues than I had. So I hope that my career has made some of those avenues available for other people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI always felt a responsibility to be authentic and real with depicting the culture. They\u2019re your relatives, they\u2019re your family. There was never one that I felt wasn\u2019t important for us to learn from.\n\nIf nominated for next year\u2019s Academy Award, Carter could become both the first woman ever to win for a superhero film and the first black woman to win for best costume design. But when asked if she has any reservations or resentments about primarily being hired to costume black films\u2014which make up most, but far from all, of her work\u2014she had this to say:", "keywords": ["cultural", "wannabes", "feel", "film", "marveldisney", "carter", "consciousness", "know", "theyre", "ruth", "costumes", "black", "wakanda", "panther", "felt"], "polarity": 0.2138487889520948, "subjectivity": 0.47147418697005467},

She says she was only allowed to wear baggy clothes and couldn\u2019t use a phone. She also had to ask when to shower, eat and use the bathroom. If the rules were broken, Pace alleges, Kelly would physically and mentally abuse her.\n\nOn June 9, 2009, Pace alleges, Kelly gave her alcohol, and the two of them had intercourse.

But since we here at The Glow Up sit at the intersection of Fashion Week and Black History Month (and Wakanda, obvi), we couldn\u2019t help noticing another trend rising the past few seasons: a surge in blackness-branded clothing we haven\u2019t seen since the early \u201990s (more on that trend to come).\n\n\n\nWhat was really striking to us was the re-emergence of our two primary civil rights icons, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr., as the focus of two clothing lines this season: the Malcolm X Legacy collection, which debuted at Harlem Fashion Week 2018, and recent releases from New York-based skateboarding brand Supreme, whose latest lookbook features clothing emblazoned with MLK\u2019s visage and most famous phrases: \u201cI have a dream\u201d and \u201cWe shall overcome.\u201d\n\nSuffice it to say, reviews on the much-better-known Supreme collection were mixed, especially among The Root crew. Our internal\u2014and anonymous\u2014staff discussions went something like this:\n\n\u201cThis is ridiculous. The King family is a mess for authorizing this.\u201d \u201cCash grab.\u201d \u201cMy beef with it is ... why is it so hideous? It looks like some shit you\u2019d see for sale on the side of the road ... or at a swamp meet.\u201d [Editor\u2019s note: Yes, she meant \u201cswamp.\u201d] \u201cThere will be no Supreme-bashing on my watch ... aka my favorite brand right now. Although I must admit that this morning\u2019s lookbook was sad, and the MLK hoodie was one of the better pieces in a sad way. ... Supreme has honored several blacks in the past, including the great Pam Grier ... Sade, Muhammad Ali, KRS-One, Malcolm X ... MLK fits that mold, even if that all-over print sweatshirt is fugazi.\u201d \u201cThe Sade was fresh. This was a mess. It looked like something I\u2019d be forced to buy if I caught a chill at Jazz Fest ... and I\u2019d stay cold.\u201d \u201cI think MLK on the arms was overkill. Never put MLK on the arms.\u201d \u201cThat sweatshirt was all the velvet paintings and airbrushed backdrops of MLK that ever were.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOK. So that release was considered less than \u201csupreme\u201d around these parts. But not to be outdone, the jewel in the crown that was 2018 Harlem Fashion Week was the debut of the Malcolm X Legacy collection, co-helmed by the six daughters of Malcolm X and Betty Shabazz\u2014Qubilah, Attallah, Ilyasah, Malikah, Gamilah and Malaak Shabazz. Instead of simply licensing their father\u2019s words and image to an existing brand, the Shabazz sisters teamed up with tech company Hingeto and emerging designer Yvonne Jewnell to collaborate on a clothing line that pays homage to their father\u2019s legacy.\n\nThe contemporary urbanwear line features clothing inspired by the 12 principles of Malcolm X, which stressed the importance of human rights, education, economic independence, cultural pride and justice. The Shabazz sisters created the collection in hopes of inspiring a younger generation of activists to follow in their father\u2019s steps.\n\nThe Glow Up\u2019s editorial team (supermodel Veronica Webb and myself) had the pleasure of being front row at the debut of the Malcolm X Legacy collection at the inaugural event of Harlem Fashion Week on Feb. 4, a sold-out runway presentation at the gorgeous Museum of the City of New York. We can vouch for the fact that these are definitely clothes for a new generation of Malcolm X followers\u2014fresh, funky, fashion-forward and sexier than expected.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd while we both enjoyed the presentation, we\u2019ll let you judge for yourselves this round.

But the family disagrees.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey simply don\u2019t like Malcolm X; that\u2019s basically their view,\u201d Mychelle Combs said. \u201cUnfortunately, I\u2019m not surprised they feel like that.\u201d\n\nAnd indeed, many white people see Malcolm X as a controversial figure, given his unapologetic defense of and insistence on black rights, black freedom and black equality \u201cby any means necessary.\u201d\n\nMalcolm X\u2019s daughter Ilyasah Shabazz reached out to the school, offering to visit for a 30-minute assembly to help educate students and staff about the black leader and to teach them about \u201cthe historic social climate through which this young, compassionate and brilliant Malcolm navigated to have an egalitarian future for all Americans (as well as any oppressed persons abroad),\u201d she pointed out in an email to the Daily News.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, Cunningham brushed off the offer, saying that the school has taught lessons on Malcolm X before.\n\n\u201cThis school has been teaching about Malcolm X for 20 years as part of African-American history,\u201d Cunningham said. \u201cMalcolm X is part of the curriculum here, so there\u2019s no attempt in any way to shun Malcolm X and his contributions to America.\u201d\n\n\n\nRight.\n\nSo now the National Action Network, along with Ilyasah Shabazz and the Combs family, have decided to gather at the National Action Network on Malcolm X Boulevard to discuss the incident.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe are not accepting no,\u201d McCall said. \u201cFor them not to be culturally sensitive is a slap in our history\u2019s face.\u201d", "keywords": ["senior", "daily", "combs", "thinks", "xs", "sweater", "mccall", "nyc", "namesake", "school", "wants", "x", "told", "black", "thats", "student", "malcolm"], "polarity": 0.05904525777253051, "subjectivity": 0.3599964580873672},

No, it does not. If I may quote Margaret Mead, \u201cNever doubt that a large group of terrible and incompetent men can be president; indeed, they\u2019re the only ones who ever have.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut impeachment talk is in the air\u2014frantically so in Twitter circles that continue to share memes of Hillary Clinton laughing with Barack Obama and more reservedly among Republicans engaged in a whisper campaign about their yearnings for a President Mike Pence.\n\nDo they dare to dream? Do you?\n\nShould Trump be removed from office, the president of the United States will no longer be a deeply bigoted dummy whose political instincts appear to be limited to self-aggrandizement and spite. Instead, the president of the United States will be a deeply bigoted zealot whose political instincts appear to be limited to a draconian interpretation of his Christian faith and a scorched earth approach to the social safety net.\n\nWithin this administration, could any kind of removal scenario\u2014be it resignation, prison, or death\u2014lead to anyone other than a moral monster assuming the most powerful office in the world?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA great question, really.\n\nFirst, we should define our terms. What is it to be good? What is it to be a good president?\n\nFor our purposes, let\u2019s say that \u201cgood\u201d is the far end of a scale measuring to what extent a president will work to implement programs that will meaningfully decrease poverty, hunger, and injustice defined broadly across a range of issues from mass incarceration to the maternal mortality rate in this country. Lofty rhetoric that packages upward redistribution in the language of fairness and opportunity doesn\u2019t count, and let\u2019s avoid the mistake of conflating decorum with goodness because fuck that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow let\u2019s consider the line of succession.\n\n1. Vice President Mike Pence\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s pretty clear that while Pence, who is first up to bat, would restore a familiar kind of stability and the pretense of deep thought to the office, he would still follow a policy agenda that hews closely to what Trump and his Republican leadership have already laid out.\n\nThere would be staggering tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy and deplete the government of the resources necessary to its basic functioning. He would sign likely sign whatever healthcare repeal bill reached his desk, maybe even waiting until it included a measure to restrict Medicaid reimbursements for providers like Planned Parenthood, since he is a true believer in a way that Trump has never convincingly mustered.\n\nAs governor of Indiana, Pence signed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, the original version of which was broad enough to allow businesses to discriminate against any person seeking services and public accommodations as long as they could root the denial in their personal religious views. The modified version was more restrained, but still left LGBTQ residents of his state incredibly vulnerable to discrimination and with rights that were distinct and lesser than their cis and straight peers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe also allowed a public health crisis to run rampant in a rural county of his state as he resisted implementing a needle exchange program to combat an HIV outbreak. He eventually relented, and the transmission rate dropped.\n\nHe is bad by these and other metrics, so we must move on.\n\n2. House Speaker Paul Ryan\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, next up after Pence, is a devout Catholic who\u2014despite being hated by nuns\u2014uses his faith to justify many of the same discriminatory policies as the vice president. As an architect of the tax cut and healthcare repeal efforts currently swimming around in Congress, and a deep hater of poor people having ready access to food, shelter, and school lunches, he\u2019d obviously sign off on whatever decimation of the welfare state reached his desk.\n\nHe also skips leg day and has the haircut of a narcish child. Unacceptable.\n\n3. President pro tempore of the Senate Orrin Hatch\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNext comes Orrin Hatch, pro tempore of the Senate and Utah\u2019s senior senator. Hatch made headlines recently after responding to a question about the unpopularity of the House healthcare bill by observing that the healthcare-needing public\u2014greedy cancer patients, presumably\u2014get \u201con the dole\u201d and then never want to get off, bleeding it for every bit of chemotherapy and maintenance treatments they can get their cancerous little hands around.\n\nHatch is extremely conservative, but is reliably accused of being a fake Republican for doing things like acknowledging that repealing Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate will burn the American healthcare system down to a smoldering ash heap and agreeing to raise the debt limit. He likes block grants and spending caps on Medicaid, the part of the American Health Care Act that would hit the poor, children, and people with disabilities the hardest, and tax cuts for wealthy people.\n\nThe rightward lurch of his party has disciplined him into more of a partisan soldier in recent years, like the time an op-ed he\u2019d filed about not being persuaded by a meeting with Merrick Garland was published before the meeting ever happened.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs designated survivor during the inauguration, he could have been president right out the gate if some Biblical plague had hit the event. That didn\u2019t happen, and he would not be a good president, anyway.\n\n4. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe now reach into Trump\u2019s Cabinet, only to emerge with fistfuls of billionaires who may sometimes have occasionally progressive social views. Also Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a petite non-billionaire who comes to us from a time portal to the Jim Crow South.\n\nBut first up is Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Again, the formula is complicated here because he has never governed or held elected office, and so has no real policy trail to follow. What we do know about Tillerson is that he accepts the science of climate change, but, as the former chief executive of the largest oil company in the world and now a member of a climate-denying administration, doesn\u2019t feel compelled to do much about it.\n\nAs the Washington Post reported at the time of his nomination, \u201cHis political giving suggests an alignment with establishment Republican politics, having given to the Republican Party of Texas repeatedly, to House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.) and to other national Republican priorities.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTillerson has spent his entire professional life doing what is best for the oil industry, and so it seems fair to assume his presidency would be something like putting a talking oil rig in the Oval Office. Let\u2019s move on.\n\n5. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSteve Mnuchin, hedge fund millionaire and former Goldman Sachs executive, first joined Trump\u2019s campaign last spring as finance chairman. Like Tillerson, he has no experience in political office so no paper trail of votes or policy. (He\u2019s donated to both Democrats and Republicans in the past.)\n\nWhat we do know is that before observing Trump spend an entire year making egregiously racist statements about Mexican immigrants and Muslim people and deciding he wanted to jump on that train, Mnuchin made a truly immoral amount of money kicking people out of their homes.\n\nTrump also spent a significant amount of time during his presidential campaign railing against Wall Street paper pushers like Mnuchin\u2014people who, like him, made money through passive transaction and tax loopholes that distribute wealth ever upward\u2014but no matter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause Eve ate the apple and we live in a fallen world, it\u2019s worth acknowledging that Mnuchin might not be Pence- or Ryan-levels of depraved on certain issues. But his fealty to Wall Street, combined with Congressional Republicans\u2019 fealty to Wall Street, would be catastrophic for everyone except for people as rich as Mnuchin, who is rich by even obscene rich people standards.\n\nOnward.\n\n6. Defense Secretary James Mattis\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe have now reached the first of Trump\u2019s generals, a group that the president deifies in good times and diminishes when things go wrong in military operations that he has largely outsourced thinking about or authorizing. Mattis, whose nickname is \u201cMad Dog,\u201d is considered a moderating influence on the Trump administration, which says more about the Trump administration than Mattis.\n\nThe former general had the good sense to denounce the Muslim ban during Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, and the bad sense to serve in the Cabinet of a president working to impose a Muslim ban. He is hawkish on Iran\u2014reportedly walking the country to the brink of military engagement last February\u2014and may have committed war crimes in Iraq. These things are familiar in the realm of American power, and unacceptable all the same.\n\n7. Attorney General Jeff Sessions\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo. No. No.\n\n8. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI could not be more thrilled that Donald Trump selected him,\u201d outgoing Utah Representative and reported future Fox News employee Jason Chaffetz told The New York Times in March, before reflecting on earlier conversations he\u2019s had with the former Republican congressman from Montana: \u201cWe talked about: \u2018The war on coal is over. We\u2019ve got friendlier, greener pastures ahead of us.\u2019 And there is a great deal of optimism and smiles on people\u2019s faces that we haven\u2019t seen in years.\u201d\n\nIf Chaffetz, who gleefully scooted back from emergency surgery to cast a vote stripping 24 million people of health insurance, is smiling, you probably shouldn\u2019t be. Zinke, like Tillerson, is not a climate skeptic, but is similarly noncommittal on the U.S. taking any kind of meaningful action on the issue and is a strong backer of the coal industry.\n\nHe\u2019s voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act, is a deeply conservative Christian who doesn\u2019t support same-sex marriage or the right of LGBTQ couples to adopt children, and in 2008 went on the record as being against affirmative in college admission. No.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue\n\nAs governor of Georgia from 2003 to 2011, Perdue\u2014who probably has this job because the president thought he was one of the chicken Perdues, which he is not\u2014displayed a number of Sessions-esque qualities: a nostalgia for the Confederacy, an appreciation of voter restrictions, and a fondness for immigration crackdowns of the sort he may recognize playing out nationally under this administration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy the rules of the transitive property, if Sessions can\u2019t be a good president for these reasons, than neither can Sonny Perdue.\n\n10. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe \u201cKing of Bankruptcy\u201d is a vulture capitalist who made a fortune buying up dying businesses. As reported earlier this year by The Nation and other outlets, a mine Ross\u2019s company acquired in West Virginia spent years accumulating workplace safety violations over the conditions faced by its non-union workforce. In 2006, 12 workers died after an explosion killed one person on impact and trapped several others in the mine. Management waited a full hour before calling for help, and it took nearly two days to reach the trapped miners. All but one of them had died by the time emergency workers arrived.\n\nIn terms of his politics, he likes tax cuts for the wealthy and doesn\u2019t like a healthcare law that brought the U.S. uninsured rate to an unprecedented low. He is also 1,000 years old and recently seemed very pleased to have not seen any protesters in Saudi Arabia, a nation that punishes dissent with beheadings.\n\n11. Labor Secretary Alex Acosta\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWho?\n\n\n\nOh.\n\nA Justice Department inspector general report on hiring practices at the Justice Department under George W. Bush also found Acosta, who was assistant attorney general of the department\u2019s Civil Rights Division, failed to \u201cexercise sufficient oversight\u201d while his deputy engaged in a politicized set of hiring practices meant to stack the department with conservative attorneys.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAttorneys hired by [Acosta deputy Brad] Schlozman were more than twice as likely to be Republican or conservative than those attorneys Scholzman was not involved in hiring,\u201d the report found.\n\nNo.\n\n12. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a representative for Georgia\u2019s 6th district, Price introduced a bill to replace the Affordable Care Act that made Paul Ryan\u2019s \u201cBetter Way\u201d plan look generous in comparison. He supports turning Medicare into a voucher system, is an anti-LGBTQ ideologue, and thinks it\u2019s reasonable for insurers to charge women more than men for coverage.\n\nBorrowing again from the rule of transitive Paul Ryan badness, Tom Price would not be a good president. QED.\n\n13. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDr. Carson feels he has no government experience, he\u2019s never run a federal agency,\u201d Ben Carson\u2019s adviser and friend Armstrong Williams told the Hill last year. \u201cThe last thing he would want to do was take a position that could cripple the presidency.\u201d\n\nThis applies just as well, presumably, to the presidency itself.\n\n14. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElaine Chao is ineligible because she isn\u2019t a natural born citizen. She is also married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and you can decide for yourself what that says about her judgement.\n\n15. Energy Secretary Rick Perry\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnergy Secretary Rick Perry is 15th in the line of succession and, like Tillerson, is an oil man with terrible politics. Perry is an anti-abortion and anti-LGBTQ ideologue who thoroughly gutted the reproductive health infrastructure of his state at the same time the maternal mortality rate doubled.\n\nHis experience as governor of Texas may help him more efficiently implement his political vision, to no one\u2019s benefit, though he also may be too stupid to effectively govern. He also had a racist summer home.\n\n16. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBetsy DeVos funneled Michigan children into charter schools while failing to improve the quality of their education. DeVos has such a bone-deep commitment to the unregulated expansion of charter schools that she eventually became a pariah even among school choice advocates, who tend to forgive the failings of their fellow \u201creformers.\u201d\n\nAn analysis of Michigan\u2019s charter schools conducted by the Detroit Free Press found that \u201c38% of charter schools that received state academic rankings during the 2012-13 school year fell below the 25th percentile, meaning at least 75% of all schools in the state performed better.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe most accurate assessment is that charter schools have simply created a second, privately managed failing system,\u201d Stephen Henderson, editorial page editor of the Detroit Free Press, wrote in December, pulling in years of the paper\u2019s reporting on educational outcomes in his analysis.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe education budget released this week by the Trump administration is a clear indication that she would like to recreate that failed experiment nationally, allocating $400 million to expand charter schools and vouchers for private and religious schools and setting aside another $1 billion to compel public schools to adopt choice policies.\n\nIt is a budget that hands public education a shovel and asks it to dig.\n\n\n\n17. Veteran Affairs Secretary David Shulkin\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs this our answer? David Shulkin was the last\u2014and probably least controversial\u2014Cabinet appointment made by Trump. Before joining this administration, he served as under secretary of Veterans Affairs for Health during the last two years of the Obama administration. Unlike several of Trump\u2019s other Cabinet appointees, he does not want to actively dismantle or privatize the department he oversees.\n\nIf we must choose someone from this administration to serve out the rest of Trump\u2019s term, Dr. Shulkin could probably do it without randomly starting a war or starving anyone.\n\nHe went to Hampshire College. Do people from Hampshire College start nuclear wars? I don\u2019t know. Is he \u201cgood\u201d by the standard defined above? I also don\u2019t know. Is he willing to sanitize the draconian outcomes of the president\u2019s preferred policies? Seems like it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRather than \u201cgood,\u201d let\u2019s call him a reversion to the mean of middle-of-the-road Democrats. This is certainly the best we could hope for in this lot, especially if you consider what Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, the last in the presidential line of succession, has been up to lately. So let\u2019s call it here.\n\nDavid Shulkin for president!

In another, Gaines appears to be talking to the young boy, identified by some media organizations as her son, asking him what he would like to do.\n\n\"Who's outside?\" Gaines asks the child.\n\n\"The police,\" the child responds.\n\n\"And what are they trying to do?\" Gaines continues.\n\n\"They trying to kill us,\" the boy answers.\n\nEarlier:\n\nBaltimore County police officers fatally shot a woman Monday following what they say was an hourslong standoff during which the 23-year-old threatened to kill the officers while pointing a gun at them, the Baltimore Sun reports.\n\nAuthorities identified the woman as Korryn Gaines. A 5-year-old boy who was with Gaines at the time of the shooting also suffered a gunshot wound, police said, but he is expected to survive.

According to the report, the Baltimore County Police Department had only just begun introducing body cameras in the last month, and only some officers have received the devices.\n\nAccording to the report, the incident began around 9:20 a.m. Monday when several warrant-squad members and a uniformed police officer went to the home in Randallstown to serve arrest warrants on Gaines and a man who also lived at the home.\n\nPolice say the man ran from the home with a 1-year-old child in tow but was eventually caught by officers. His name has not yet been released.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolice \"repeatedly knocked on the apartment door,\" and say they heard a man's voice and a woman's voice as well as that of a crying child, but say no one answered the summons after police identified themselves.\n\nAccording to the Sun, Gaines was wanted for not appearing for cases related to a March incident in which she was charged with disorderly conduct, resisting arrest and several traffic violations.\n\nOn Monday, authorities say, police showing up to the apartment where Gaines was got a key from the landlord, opened the apartment door and saw Gaines seated on the floor. Police say that she had the 5-year-old boy in her arms and was holding a long gun, which, police say, she pointed at one of the officers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThus began an hourslong negotiation, police say.\n\n\"During that dialogue and conversation, she repeatedly pointed a long gun at the police officers,\" Baltimore County Police Chief Jim Johnson told the Sun.\n\nSeveral hours later, at around 3 p.m., Gaines pointed the long gun at police officers again and told them that if they didn't leave, \"she was going to kill them,\" Johnson said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat's when an officer fired once at Gaines, and she fired back several times, the police chief said.

However, Wright Simpson maintains that a \u201cspecial recognition dinner\u201d did take place.\n\nAfter disputing the charges, and two days after the report, Wright Simpson, the third most senior official at the VA, which has a $182 billion budget and more than 340,000 employees, retired after 32 years with the agency.\n\n\u201cShe called me this morning and told me she doesn\u2019t want to be in this environment anymore,\u201d Shulkin told the Military Times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe MT reports that Wright Simpson had been a target of critics within the VA for not jumping to implement a host of reforms proposed by President Donald Trump\u2019s administration.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump has made clear that he expects VA leaders to hold themselves and other employees accountable when they fail to live up to the high standards taxpayers and veterans deserve,\u201d VA spokesman Curt Cashour said in an email to CNBC.\n\nSecretary Shulkin is one of the only Obama holdovers in the current administration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShulkin, for his part, says the IG report is \u201centirely inaccurate\u201d but has reimbursed the government for his wife\u2019s airfare.\n\nSome members of Congress have called on Shulkin to resign.

But since we here at The Glow Up sit at the intersection of Fashion Week and Black History Month (and Wakanda, obvi), we couldn\u2019t help noticing another trend rising the past few seasons: a surge in blackness-branded clothing we haven\u2019t seen since the early \u201990s (more on that trend to come).\n\n\n\nWhat was really striking to us was the re-emergence of our two primary civil rights icons, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr., as the focus of two clothing lines this season: the Malcolm X Legacy collection, which debuted at Harlem Fashion Week 2018, and recent releases from New York-based skateboarding brand Supreme, whose latest lookbook features clothing emblazoned with MLK\u2019s visage and most famous phrases: \u201cI have a dream\u201d and \u201cWe shall overcome.\u201d\n\nSuffice it to say, reviews on the much-better-known Supreme collection were mixed, especially among The Root crew. Our internal\u2014and anonymous\u2014staff discussions went something like this:\n\n\u201cThis is ridiculous. The King family is a mess for authorizing this.\u201d \u201cCash grab.\u201d \u201cMy beef with it is ... why is it so hideous? It looks like some shit you\u2019d see for sale on the side of the road ... or at a swamp meet.\u201d [Editor\u2019s note: Yes, she meant \u201cswamp.\u201d] \u201cThere will be no Supreme-bashing on my watch ... aka my favorite brand right now. Although I must admit that this morning\u2019s lookbook was sad, and the MLK hoodie was one of the better pieces in a sad way. ... Supreme has honored several blacks in the past, including the great Pam Grier ... Sade, Muhammad Ali, KRS-One, Malcolm X ... MLK fits that mold, even if that all-over print sweatshirt is fugazi.\u201d \u201cThe Sade was fresh. This was a mess. It looked like something I\u2019d be forced to buy if I caught a chill at Jazz Fest ... and I\u2019d stay cold.\u201d \u201cI think MLK on the arms was overkill. Never put MLK on the arms.\u201d \u201cThat sweatshirt was all the velvet paintings and airbrushed backdrops of MLK that ever were.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOK. So that release was considered less than \u201csupreme\u201d around these parts. But not to be outdone, the jewel in the crown that was 2018 Harlem Fashion Week was the debut of the Malcolm X Legacy collection, co-helmed by the six daughters of Malcolm X and Betty Shabazz\u2014Qubilah, Attallah, Ilyasah, Malikah, Gamilah and Malaak Shabazz. Instead of simply licensing their father\u2019s words and image to an existing brand, the Shabazz sisters teamed up with tech company Hingeto and emerging designer Yvonne Jewnell to collaborate on a clothing line that pays homage to their father\u2019s legacy.\n\nThe contemporary urbanwear line features clothing inspired by the 12 principles of Malcolm X, which stressed the importance of human rights, education, economic independence, cultural pride and justice. The Shabazz sisters created the collection in hopes of inspiring a younger generation of activists to follow in their father\u2019s steps.\n\nThe Glow Up\u2019s editorial team (supermodel Veronica Webb and myself) had the pleasure of being front row at the debut of the Malcolm X Legacy collection at the inaugural event of Harlem Fashion Week on Feb. 4, a sold-out runway presentation at the gorgeous Museum of the City of New York. We can vouch for the fact that these are definitely clothes for a new generation of Malcolm X followers\u2014fresh, funky, fashion-forward and sexier than expected.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd while we both enjoyed the presentation, we\u2019ll let you judge for yourselves this round. Because when it comes to wearing our love for our slain civil rights leaders on our sleeves, maybe there\u2019s only one question: Who wore it best?", "keywords": ["shabazz", "mlk", "befits", "legacy", "civil", "best", "fashion", "collection", "clothing", "week", "supreme", "x", "icon", "rights", "malcolm"], "polarity": 0.12235064935064938, "subjectivity": 0.5086450216450217},

We are listening. Because opening with Malcolm means it\u2019s about to go down.\n\nShe followed up by calling the United States the greatest nation on earth, but reminding us: \u201cIn 1877, America put laws in place called the Jim Crow laws,\u201d and those laws \u201crestricted the rights of quadroons, octoroons, blacks, Hispanics, Malays ... they restricted medical, relationships, education, in all, \u201cthey restricted life.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavis also quoted Martin Luther King Jr., and then she got animated, telling the crowd that the price of freedom is certainly not free.\n\n\u201cWe only move forward when it doesn\u2019t cost us anything,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m here today saying that no one and nothing can be great unless it costs you something.\u201d\n\nShe noted that women of color, if they are raped or sexually assaulted before the age of 18, are 66 percent more likely to be raped or sexually assaulted again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSeventy percent of girls who are sexually trafficked are girls of color,\u201d Davis added. \u201cThey are coming out of the foster care system, they are coming out of poverty.

But my testimony is one of poverty. My testimony is one of being sexually assaulted and very much seeing a childhood that was robbed from me. And I know that every single day, when I think of that, I know that the trauma of those events are still with me today. And that\u2019s what drives me to the voting booth. That\u2019s what allows me to listen to the women who are still in silence. That\u2019s what allows me to even be a citizen on this planet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then, hammering the point home, she said ain\u2019t nobody free till we all free.\n\n\u201cAs we live on earth, we\u2019ve got to bring everyone with us,\u201d said Davis.\n\nBrava, Ms. Davis.

G. Taylor Spink Award, given to her for meritorious contributions to baseball writing. She is the 68th recipient of the award from the Baseball Writers\u2019 Association of America, and the first female honoree \u2014 a formal acknowledgment that men do not own exclusive rights to the most powerful written words.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c \u2018I humbly stand on stage for those who were stung by racism or sexism or any other insidious bias and persevered,\u2019 Smith said. \u2018You are unbreakable. You make me proud.\u2019\n\n\u201cSmith, 64, spent more than three decades as a newspaper reporter and columnist, including a significant stint as a national baseball writer and columnist for The New York Times from 1991 to 1998. During that period, she wrote about the near death and rebirth of the sport \u2014 from the destructive strike that wiped out the 1994 season to the dawning of a new Yankees dynasty at the end of the decade. She later moved home to work for the Philadelphia Inquirer and became a news editor for ESPN in 2007.\n\n\u201cIt was before that, during her years with The Hartford Courant as a pioneering, full-time female baseball beat writer covering the Yankees, that Smith met the most resistance from players and officials. But not from that era\u2019s tumultuous Yanks, she said with a laugh. \u2018They hardly noticed me, she said, \u2018because they were holding on for dear life.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cInstead, her greatest challenge came from the San Diego Padres during their 1984 playoff series against the Chicago Cubs. She was ejected from the clubhouse, then rescued by an empathetic Padres player, Steve Garvey, who fed her quotes from his teammates.\n\n\u201cBut Smith was no damsel in distress; she had an unbending professionalism about her that wore down even the most stubborn resistance.\n\n\u201c \u2018I had a game story to write,\u2019 she said in 1984, after she had been pushed out the Padres\u2019 door.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOther pioneers in the sport \u2014 including Sandy Koufax, the Jewish Dodgers pitcher who refused to play on Yom Kippur during the World Series; Frank Robinson, the first black manager in the major leagues; and Rachel Robinson, the widow of Jackie Robinson \u2014 gave her a standing ovation Saturday. . . .\u201d\n\nDom Amore, Hartford Courant: Claire Smith Legacy Lauded In Hall Of Fame Ceremony\n\nJenni Carlson, the Oklahoman: Why the story of baseball writer Claire Smith should be told in Cooperstown and beyond\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDoug Glanville, New York Times: Who Gets to Call the Game?\n\nMark Herrmann, Newsday: Hall of Fame reporter Claire Smith has quite the storied career\n\nSharon Robinson, narrator, ESPN: SC Featured: Hall of Famer Claire Smith in a league of her own (video)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSusan Slusser, San Francisco Chronicle: Pioneering baseball writer Claire Smith recognized at Cooperstown\n\nArizona Republic reporters Megan Cassidy and Richard Ruelas take viewers through the conviction of former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio and what it means for him.

Lack set out to abandon most of the channel\u2019s low-rated opinion-based programming and install in its place news-heavy programs that would make MSNBC more like the channel\u2019s sister site, NBC News. (Stephens, like some of the other recent hires, contributes to both.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut the election of Donald Trump has complicated that evolution, raising the profile and popularity of MSNBC\u2019s liberal hosts just as Lack sought to dial back the network\u2019s liberal identity. . . .\u201d\n\nSutton also wrote, \u201cWhat has stung the most to some people hasn\u2019t simply been the hires of ex-Fox talent or outspoken conservatives, but the fact that the hires have seemed to replace many of the network\u2019s hosts of color. Since Lack\u2019s return to MSNBC, according to HuffPost, at least nine contributors and show hosts of color have departed the channel. The loss of several familiar faces of color has been particularly stark against the backdrop of the new hires, many of whom are white.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cConcerns about diversity have been amplified in part by a series of contentious departures that have played out in the press. In February 2016, progressive weekend host Melissa Harris-Perry, who is black, refused to appear on her show, publicly alleging that the network was trying to usurp her 4-year-old program and dictate her editorial choices. She was fired, prompting discussion over whether MSNBC remained committed to the diverse opinions and guests that Harris-Perry\u2019s show had prioritized.\n\n\u201cThe conversation arose again when anchor Jose Diaz-Balart was regularly preempted for election coverage. (Diaz-Balart, who is Cuban-American, is no longer an MSNBC host, but he remains a host on NBCUniversal\u2019s Telemundo and on NBC News.) And it reached a fever pitch in January following the abrupt departure of NBC News and MSNBC host Tamron Hall, who reportedly decided to leave the network after discovering she would lose her Today show hour to [Megyn] Kelly.\n\n\u201cNo one Mic spoke to believed Lack intentionally targeted hosts of color, but four MSNBC insiders said they do not believe Lack actively prioritizes on-screen diversity. The loss of diverse hosts, then, is more of an unintended consequence of the long-term reinvention of the channel. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, \u201cTVNewser has learned that Raelyn Johnson has been promoted to executive producer, MSNBC Weekends,\u201d A.J. Katz reported Friday for TVNewser. \u201cJohnson is presently a senior producer on the 3 p.m. MSNBC Live with Ali Velshi hour, and will transition into her new role over the next few weeks.\n\n\u201cPrior to joining MSNBC in November 2015, Johnson was as a senior producer with Al Jazeera America. She was one of the original team members to launch that network. . . .\u201d\n\n3 News Outlets Got Cold Feet on R. Kelly Story\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cCall it the Gawker Effect,\u201d Margaret Sullivan wrote Sunday in the Washington Post.\n\n\n\n\u201cAfter Jim DeRogatis, the veteran Chicago rock critic, reported for months on a stunning story about R&B singer R. Kelly and the young women said to be under his psychological and sexual control, it came time to get it published.\n\n\u201cThree separate media organizations were interested but got cold feet at the last minute, DeRogatis said. Each one, after investing months of work, backed away from the story that used named sources and documents to describe how women near Atlanta and Chicago were held as if in a cult, according to what parents and others had told police.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(DeRogatis declined to name the news organizations because of his appreciation of the editors he worked with; they weren\u2019t the ones who pulled the plug. They include a regional print publication, a world-famous multimedia behemoth and a radio-based digital outlet.)\n\n\u201c \u2018Gawker came up in a lot of those conversations,\u2019 DeRogatis said, referring to the snarky and risk-taking website that was put out of business last summer after a lawsuit brought by Terry Bollea, also known as Hulk Hogan. The invasion-of-privacy suit was bankrolled by billionaire Peter Thiel, a confidant of President Trump.\n\n\u201c \u2018Nobody wanted to take that risk.\u2019\n\n\u201cDeRogatis has pursued the R. Kelly story doggedly, first writing about it well over a decade ago and taking the Fifth Amendment in a subsequent trial rather than reveal his sources. (The longtime rock critic for the Chicago Sun-Times, DeRogatis also had a brief stint with Rolling Stone magazine; he was famously fired after he complained publicly that publisher Jann Wenner had killed his pan of a Hootie and the Blowfish album.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c \u2018This is a tawdry, sickening tale,\u2019 he told me. In an interview with Vox, he described the \u2018rape culture\u2019 he believes is the underlying story.\n\n\u201cUltimately, DeRogatis turned to a fourth outlet, BuzzFeed, which published the jaw-dropping story this month under the headline \u2018Inside the Pied Piper of R&B\u2019s \u201cCult.\u201d \u2018\n\n\u201c \u2018When we pursue a story, our primary concern is whether it\u2019s accurate and newsworthy \u2014 not whether the subject is too rich or powerful, be it Russian oligarchs, R. Kelly or the Trump White House,\u2019 said BuzzFeed spokesman Matt Mittenthal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not just a question of having what DeRogatis calls \u2018major cojones.\u2019 BuzzFeed\u2019s lawyers managed to make the story bulletproof, or apparently so, since there has been no challenge to its facts, not even a request for a minor correction. (Kelly has publicly insisted that there\u2019s no truth that he runs a cult or anything like it.)\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of uncertainty and fear out there, post-Gawker, said Nabiha Syed, BuzzFeed\u2019s assistant general counsel, who vetted the story before publication. . . .\u201d\n\nTMZ: R.

Even without the imposition of chains, these laws made freedom nearly impossible. Many black men, women and children freed from physical bondage\u2014at least on paper\u2014were forced to toil in cotton fields from sunup to sundown on plantations throughout the Deep South.\n\n\u201cI know hard work,\u201d said Earl Gales, one of the 1968 sanitation strikers, who was a small child when he began sharecropping. \u201cI know hard work because I did hard work all my life.\u201d\n\nBy 1900, 85 percent of black people did not own the land they farmed, compared with 36 percent of white people.

Sometimes, the criticism to the criticism goes even further, and racially-tinged epithets like coon, sellout, and negro bed wench are spat in their direction.

I put them together because they're each very high profile Black men, and the types of criticism aimed at the people who criticize them are similar.)\n\nAs someone who has been on the receiving end of the criticism of the criticism \u2014 just last week, someone on Facebook pointed to a piece I wrote about #TeamLawrence as evidence I'm ghostwriting for the Rothchilds (or something) \u2014 I'll admit that it bothers me. The names themselves don't matter much to me. You call me a coon or a sellout, and I'll shrug my shoulders and bite a pancake. My annoyance is more about their abject lack of self-awareness. While they're accusing us of being anti-Black, they're the ones allowing racial stereotypes to dictate their thoughts and actions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo wit, a common response to the criticism of Lavar Ball's ridiculous bombast is that we're trying to sabotage \"the one brotha who's standing up for his kids.\" And the \"rare Black man willing to challenge White people.\" And \"one of the only Black dads out there so active in their kids' lives.\"\n\nBut \u2014 and take this whichever way you want \u2014 Lavar aint special. Yes, his sons are special basketball players. And he has a special, Trumpian gift for shamelessness and self-promotion. But there are hundred of thousands of Black dads who stand up for their sons just like he does. And are willing to challenge White people just like he does. And are just as active in their kids' lives as he is. The only difference between Lavar Ball and literally any Black dad you can find doing Mikan drills with his son or daughter on a YMCA court today is that Lavar has a megaphone. A megaphone we only bother listening to because his sons are great players.\n\nExcusing his fuckshit and defending him as some rare and precious jewel of Black manhood and Black fatherhood implicitly agrees with the worst stereotypes about Black men and Black fathers. That we're so rare that Lavar Ball has to be handled like the Hope fucking Diamond. The same could be said about Umar Johnson. Who's defended like he's The Last Airbender, when I can personally name, right now without Google, (at least) 40 real actual Black men with real actual PhDs who are knowledgable about race and racism and unafraid to confront Whiteness and aren't misogynists and homophobes and haven't used GoFundMe donations to buy Muscle Milk and Bigen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUltimately, this defense is what happens when you've allowed what the world expects of Black men to exist as your standard. You start believing the hype \u2014 insisting that A Black Man Doing A Thing is so isolated and rarefied that it's worth excusing all the terrible just to preserve the talent. And while this train of thought might possess the veneer of pro-Blackness, it's actually pervasively anti-Black, as the coddling suggests that these men aren't able to be better people. Like it's impossible for us to be talented and not terrible.\n\nAnd yea, it's true that there are countless forces out there actively trying to kill us. Police. Donald Trump. Darth Susans.

So that release was considered less than \u201csupreme\u201d around these parts. But not to be outdone, the jewel in the crown that was 2018 Harlem Fashion Week was the debut of the Malcolm X Legacy collection, co-helmed by the six daughters of Malcolm X and Betty Shabazz\u2014Qubilah, Attallah, Ilyasah, Malikah, Gamilah and Malaak Shabazz. Instead of simply licensing their father\u2019s words and image to an existing brand, the Shabazz sisters teamed up with tech company Hingeto and emerging designer Yvonne Jewnell to collaborate on a clothing line that pays homage to their father\u2019s legacy.\n\nThe contemporary urbanwear line features clothing inspired by the 12 principles of Malcolm X, which stressed the importance of human rights, education, economic independence, cultural pride and justice. The Shabazz sisters created the collection in hopes of inspiring a younger generation of activists to follow in their father\u2019s steps.\n\nThe Glow Up\u2019s editorial team (supermodel Veronica Webb and myself) had the pleasure of being front row at the debut of the Malcolm X Legacy collection at the inaugural event of Harlem Fashion Week on Feb. 4, a sold-out runway presentation at the gorgeous Museum of the City of New York. We can vouch for the fact that these are definitely clothes for a new generation of Malcolm X followers\u2014fresh, funky, fashion-forward and sexier than expected.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd while we both enjoyed the presentation, we\u2019ll let you judge for yourselves this round.

The licensor of King\u2019s estate, which approves the use of his words and likeness, is Intellectual Properties Management Inc. Dexter Scott King, the iconic civil rights leader\u2019s youngest son, is the group\u2019s CEO.\n\nEarlier:\n\nIt was an ad so incongruous with what Martin Luther King Jr. stood for that it beggared belief.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Super Bowl ad for Dodge Ram pickup trucks featured a voice-over from MLK\u2019s \u201cDrum Major Instinct\u201d speech. The speech, which extolled the value of service and warned of the dangers of capitalism and marketing, was delivered by King in Atlanta on Feb. 4, 1968, just months before he would be assassinated.\n\nIn the ad, which aired on the 50th anniversary of the original speech, you can hear King\u2019s distinctive cadence delivering the words: \u201cIf you want to be important, wonderful. If you want to be recognized, wonderful. If you want to be great, wonderful. But recognize that he who is greatest among you shall be a servant.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs he says this, a black Dodge Ram barrels in slow motion through the mud onto the screen, wipers gliding across the windshield.\n\nService, ladies and gentleman. Available with no money down at your nearest Chrysler dealer.\n\nThe ad was immediately blasted\u2014and the King Center and Bernice King, MLK\u2019s daughter, made clear they had had nothing to do with the ad. In fact, the King Center said that neither it nor Bernice King has the right to approve MLK\u2019s words or image \u201cfor use in merchandise, entertainment ... or advertisement.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany Twitter users pointed out that the rest of the speech actually warned against the harms of capitalism\u2014which is to say, being persuaded to \u201ckeep up with the Joneses\u201d and living beyond your means. The irony was so rich, someone even overlaid the ad with a portion of King\u2019s speech in which he mentioned how people are \u201cso taken by advertisers ... those gentlemen of massive verbal persuasion.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey have a way of saying things to you that kind of gets you into buying,\u201d King can be heard saying in the alternate version. \u201cIn order to be a man of distinction, you must drink this whiskey. In order to make your neighbors envious, you must drive this type of car.\u201d\n\nOr, you know, if you want your friends and family to know you\u2019re about that service life, buy a Dodge Ram.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition, it\u2019s worthwhile to note that the ad also features military servicemen prominently, another image that doesn\u2019t jibe all the way with King\u2019s moral compass\u2014he was anti-imperialist and was staunchly against the Vietnam War for that reason.\n\nSo who let this happen? The famously litigious King estate\u2014which, again, neither the King Center nor Bernice King has any control over. Slate magazine reports that Eric D. Tidwell, managing director of Intellectual Properties Management Inc.\u2014the \u201cexclusive licensor\u201d of King\u2019s estate, and whose CEO is Dexter Scott King\u2014said in a statement that the estate was \u201cpleasantly surprised at the existence of the Ram Nation volunteers and their efforts.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore from Tidwell\u2019s statement:\n\nWe learned that as a volunteer group of Ram owners, they serve others through everything from natural disaster relief, to blood drives, to local community volunteer initiatives. Once the final creative was presented for approval, it was reviewed to ensure it met our standard integrity clearances. We found that the overall message of the ad embodied Dr. King\u2019s philosophy that true greatness is achieved by serving others. Thus we decided to be a part of Ram\u2019s \u201cBuilt to Serve\u201d Super Bowl program.\ufeff\n\nTo borrow the parlance from one iconic Tyra Banks/America\u2019s Next Top Model meme: Drum major for justice, but make it all-terrain.", "keywords": ["yes", "dodge", "mlk", "speech", "approve", "ram", "kings", "statement", "king", "wonderful", "super", "trash", "words", "bowl", "ad", "estate"], "polarity": 0.27212695740473525, "subjectivity": 0.5440583079471968},

I have zero science to back this up; nor do I have a link to a white paper from the Atlanta Conference of Negro Problems\u2019 (that was a real thing, by the way) early writings that proves this axiom dating back to the 1870s. Truth is, some shit is just true.\n\nWhich is why I\u2019m glad I was raised in a black household. There were things I grew up with and learned that I likely wouldn\u2019t have gotten had I grown up in any other circumstance. Also, you like how I properly used the term axiom?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyway, here are 10 reasons I\u2019m glad I was raised in a black household.\n\n1. I grew up listening to Luther Vandross.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine living in a world where I had to discover the greatness of Luther as an adult and then actively think about all the years I missed out on having that music in my life. As a youth, while I was living with my white mother, we listened to a veritable cornucopia of music, including black music. But in white households, that means Michael Jackson and Jimi Hendrix. My mother also has an affinity for Peaches & Herb\u2014\u201cReunited,\u201d to be specific.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut once I moved to live with my pops, I got nonstop Motown, Stax, Luther, Aretha and all the great music that spoke more directly to my soul than ZZ Top and AC/DC\u2014both groups I enjoy, but it\u2019s just ... different. To be fair, my father also had a penchant for Kenny G, and Rod Stewart was never too far. Nobody\u2019s perfect.\n\n2. I learned that when you see other people start running, you start running.\n\nI don\u2019t know what \u201cGet the fuck out of Dodge\u201d procedures are taught in other cultures or if any are taught at all. I do know that somewhere along the way, the words \u201cAnd boy, if you see a group of people running, you run in the same direction and you don\u2019t stop to ask no questions or find out what\u2019s going on until you see 75 to 96 percent of everybody else stop\u201d were passed to me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. I grew up on a significant number of black movies.\n\nIF there was a movie with mostly black people in it, we were watching it. From The Last Dragon to The Wiz. Of course, we watched anything with Eddie Murphy\u2014as did everybody, apparently. Did you know that Coming to America did nearly $300 million in 1988?! But I know who Sho\u2019nuff is, and even though I think the movie is trash, the soundtrack to The Wiz is amazeballs.\n\n4. Seasoning, seasoning everywhere.\n\nThis is one of those stereotypical things that I\u2019ve accepted as fact even though my proof is akin to the proof white folks needed to convict black men in the \u201950s. The only time I\u2019ve eaten white cooking has largely been when I was with my white mother during the summers, and she loved her some seasoning. Other than that, I can\u2019t actually say that I spent much time in any white people\u2019s households long enough to eat their cooking. Now that I think about this, I\u2019m not sure if this is sad or God\u2019s grace. Maybe it\u2019s both. Clearly, I don\u2019t know enough white people. Or any outside of family, really. In terms of other cultures, I know they be seasoning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. I grew up with a healthy fear of my parents.\n\nI\u2019m not saying other folks didn\u2019t, but I have children, which means I\u2019ve been to children\u2019s birthday parties and outings where other adults interacted with their children. Or even better: Last month, I had to fly to Detroit for a family situation. When I flew back to Washington, D.C., as I was walking through the TSA Precheck line (FTMFW!), a family of four was in front of me.\n\nThere was a bowl of peppermints available to folks in the line, and the mom made some remark about her maybe-12-year-old son and eating peppermints. This little white child yelled out, \u201cMom, you\u2019re SUCH A JERK SOMETIMES!\u201d Do you know the mom looked at me as if to see if anybody noticed, and I just shook my head?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, my black mother is a super-friendly, very nice, God-fearing woman who embarrasses easy when her very loud children (me and one of my sisters) get to the shenanigans. But do you know what I would NEVER fathom doing for fear of this woman who hasn\u2019t put a foreign object on me since fifth grade? Calling her a jerk or anything outside of her name ever\u2014but especially publicly.\n\nFor one, what if that sent her over the edge? For b, what if she said, \u201cI\u2019m gonna tell your father\u201d? That man listens to Kenny G. He\u2019s capable of anything. That little white boy yelled this IN FRONT of both his parents AT his mother. I\u2019m just saying. I\u2019ve got fear in my heart ... of my parents. It might not be a UNIVERSAL black trait, but I got it from my black-hand side.\n\n6. Life was one big-ass black history lesson.\n\nSure, we watched fun stuff, but my parents also made us watch movies about historical atrocities committed against black people. I remember watching a documentary on the Scottsboro Boys over and over again. Black books were around, and we had a black encyclopedia set and black-Jesus-centric Bible (still do).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m sure in some homes, the talk about being a black man in America went something like, \u201cAight Ja\u2019Rome, get your black ass killed tonight by some cracka-ass-cracka white cop because YOU think it\u2019s a good idea to act like you ain\u2019t go\u2019 no damn sense hanging out there with DonQ\u2019uestajuan, Black and Lil Jimmy from 41st.\u201d In others, it wasn\u2019t so succinct and required a lot more subtlety and nuance.\n\nAlso, I grew up reading The Autobiography of Malcolm X and staring at the book version of Roots (seriously, that shit looks like it has all the pages) but watching the movie. Just saying, are white families making their kids read about Malcolm? I\u2019m better off for it.\n\n7. I went to typical long-service black churches as a youth.\n\nI currently attend a church\u2014when I\u2019m there\u2014that lasts about an hour, hour and a half tops. I appreciate this with all of the appreciation I can muster because I grew up going to church services that could last two-and-a-half hours, easy. And don\u2019t get me started on Easter. New suits are awesome, but sitting in there for a week waiting to get to another sermon about Jesus rising was not the business.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoing to that solidly Southern, super-long black-church service has me looking at come-as-you-are, hourlong services like a smaller version of the lottery. I went to a white service once in Alabama, and aside from the music being trash (not sure we can call it that, actually), the service was so short that I thought maybe we were cheating God by leaving after only an hour. I also recognize not all nonblack churches believe in brevity.\n\n8. I learned the significance of NOT giving left-hand dap.\n\nDisrespect is the leading cause of death for black males between the age of birth and death. I\u2019ve said this for the past 20 years and I cannot be convinced this isn\u2019t true. One thing white dudes don\u2019t seem to mind doing is extending that left hand. I\u2019ve actually seen with my own two eyes a fight nearly break out because one dude refused to accept a left-handed dap and the other fellow took offense at the implication that he was being disrespectful by offering it. Again, disrespect is a thing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. When somebody says \u201cIt\u2019s a black thing\u201d or \u201cThat\u2019s some white shit,\u201d I immediately understand what\u2019s happening.\n\nNo question is more annoying than \u201cWhat do you mean, it\u2019s a black thing? I don\u2019t understand.\u201d Especially coming from black people. You\u2019re just being contrarian or your parents REALLY tried to hide some shit from you. Mine didn\u2019t. I get it. And I always get it. And well, \u201cThat\u2019s some white shit\u201d is just one of those things that I believe growing up in a black household helped to crystallize, and largely covers the world of parenting, dancing, living, outdoor survival, near-death experiences for hobby or sport, and all other forms of noncolored active activities.\n\n10. I think being black is awesome and not some pathological condition that is full of negativity.\n\nI was raised to enjoy my blackness and believe that it didn\u2019t define me in any negative way. In fact, I believe that being black has only helped me out in life, whether through hard lessons and soft behinds or just by enjoying and appreciating seeing others succeed who know my life. Point is, growing up in my household helped me see pride, power and a bad-ass mudda who don\u2019t take no crap offa nobody.", "keywords": ["household", "im", "reasons", "shit", "dont", "music", "know", "raised", "glad", "think", "grew", "white", "black", "ive"], "polarity": 0.06031739351183798, "subjectivity": 0.4363167610852791},

Barnum of fashion who has turned his distinct point of view into a budding fashion empire, debuted his latest collaboration with Jimmy Choo Tuesday night. Abloh, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Kanye West\u2019s and a Grammy nominee for his work on Watch the Throne, was propelled to the forefront of fashion via association with the Kardashian family by grace of the king-making power of their social media influence\u2014influence that has also served designers like Olivier Rousteing of Balmain, who, like Abloh, is on the rise as one of the new rulers of fashion.\n\nWhat Abloh has is a keen understanding of consumer desire\u2014a yearning to be savvy enough to incorporate high-art motifs into closet staples like boots and T-shirts, along with a craving for street cred. His Off-White label provides both, producing $1,700 satin pussy-bow blouses with ties that dust the floor, and white plastic boots with the words \u201cFor Walking\u201d or \u201cOff-White\u201d in black safety-sign lettering up the side. Even the label\u2019s logo-decaled smartphone cases retail for a cool $95 and seem to be in the palms of private school kids from coast to coast.\n\nAlboh\u2019s style is entertaining and fun, but his offerings have that kind of art-world brevity about them where, even if the high-ticket items are a joke on the buyer, it\u2019s better to be in on the joke than not to get it at all. It\u2019s exactly this kind of savvy marketing that has won the designer collaborations with brands as diverse as Ikea and famed artists like Takashi Murakami, while Off-White is a favorite among top models, luxury-fashion editors, the hip-hop crowd and those who want to feel hip by association.\n\n\n\nJimmy Choo via You Tube\n\nAbloh\u2019s newest collaborative collection, Off-White \u2105 Jimmy Choo, brings together all the elements of his fascinations: art, fashion, and \u201980s and \u201990s iconic cool. On its website, Jimmy Choo posted that the collection was inspired by the late Princess Diana, an interesting muse, given that we are all waiting with bated breath to see how Meghan Markle will leave her stamp on royal style.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s also a deft move on Abloh\u2019s part; last November he was the first black designer to receive a British Fashion Council Award for Urban Luxe Brand. Princess Di and urban streetwear could not be farther part\u2014although the princess was known to put on a leotard and tights for roller-skating around the halls of Buckingham Palace.\n\nWhy this move toward regal attire and ladylike fare is so cunning on Abloh\u2019s part is that, in true P.T. Barnum style, it\u2019s a three-ring-circus. Just when you thought it was just sneakers and cellphone covers, here comes something entirely new to capture your imagination.\n\nSandra Choi, Kendall Jenner and Virgil Abloh (Jimmy Choo via Instagram) Kendall Jenner and Gigi Hadid (Jimmy Choo via Instagram) 1 / 2\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe party to fete his Spring/Summer 2018 ready-to-wear collection and Off-White \u2105 Jimmy Choo, both of which will be in stores this week, drew an A-list crowd of models like Bella and Gigi Hadid, Kaia Gerber, Kendall Jenner and Naomi Campbell, decked out in the Princess Di-inspired collection along with the shoes. The clothes were sophisticated and subdued for the most part\u2014garden party chintz, sharply cut suits with walking shorts and cropped jackets with lapels that jutted forward like the bow of the royal yacht\u2014while stilettos were covered in clear PVC cocoons or ruched with tulle. Tulle, that most feminine and genteel of fabrics, was also applied to thigh-high boots, casting a kind of fairy-tale softness to the look.\n\nOf the unlikely brand matchup, Abloh told Women\u2019s Wear Daily:\n\nIt was an idea I had. I\u2019d met Sandra [Choi] at the Bowery hotel, and I always had this idea within my collection to sort of get more specific and story-tell ... I was working on this collection that was a tribute to Princess Diana and [Jimmy Choo] were a shoemaker that were making shoes for her. And I thought it could have been a cool way to relate the product and the narrative of Princess Diana to a younger audience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI think that no matter what Abloh does, he\u2019s got a firm creative hold on the zeitgeist and will surely remain part of the greatest show on earth.", "keywords": ["collection", "collaboration", "choo", "fashion", "covet", "jimmy", "abloh", "jenner", "princess", "kendall", "bnyfw", "kind", "offwhite"], "polarity": 0.23849431818181818, "subjectivity": 0.49405513468013457},

But it\u2019s not just the use of King\u2019s words to sell trucks that got it wrong\u2014it\u2019s what the rest of that exact sermon said about car buying, and capitalism itself.\n\nThese parts of his legacy get overlooked today\u2014often intentionally\u2014but in addition to civil rights, King staunchly confronted the dual threats of the excesses of capitalism and militarism.\n\nThe words in the Ram ad are from a sermon King gave at the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta on Feb. 4, 1968. Entitled \u201cThe Drum Major Instinct,\u201d it was broadly about the concepts of humility and modesty, about the toxic human drive to always be in front, to always be the star, to be the drum major in the marching band of life:\n\nNow the presence of the drum major instinct is why so many people are \u201cjoiners.\u201d You know, there are some people who just join everything. And it\u2019s really a quest for attention and recognition and importance. And they get names that give them that impression. So you get your groups, and they become the \u201cGrand Patron,\u201d and the little fellow who is henpecked at home needs a chance to be the \u201cMost Worthy of the Most Worthy\u201d of something. It is the drum major impulse and longing that runs the gamut of human life. And so we see it everywhere, this quest for recognition. And we join things, overjoin really, that we think that we will find that recognition in.\ufeff\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe drum major instinct isn\u2019t just limited to the idea of joining groups, however. It\u2019s also tied to the drive of mass consumption. To get the newer and shinier thing, to get the bigger and better thing. Too often, to get the latest and greatest car, and the very people who advertise cars know you have this instinct, and they prey upon it:\n\nNow the presence of this instinct explains why we are so often taken by advertisers. You know, those gentlemen of massive verbal persuasion. And they have a way of saying things to you that kind of gets you into buying. In order to be a man of distinction, you must drink this whiskey. In order to make your neighbors envious, you must drive this type of car. (Make it plain) In order to be lovely to love you must wear this kind of lipstick or this kind of perfume. And you know, before you know it, you\u2019re just buying that stuff. (Yes) That\u2019s the way the advertisers do it.\ufeff\n\nIt may seem a little on-the-nose, but King was warning against the very specific thing that Ram is doing now. And more than that,\n\nBut very seriously, it goes through life; the drum major instinct is real. (Yes) And you know what else it causes to happen? It often causes us to live above our means. (Make it plain) It\u2019s nothing but the drum major instinct. Do you ever see people buy cars that they can\u2019t even begin to buy in terms of their income? (Amen) [laughter] You\u2019ve seen people riding around in Cadillacs and Chryslers who don\u2019t earn enough to have a good T-Model Ford. (Make it plain) But it feeds a repressed ego. You know, economists tell us that your automobile should not cost more than half of your annual income. So if you make an income of five thousand dollars, your car shouldn\u2019t cost more than about twenty-five hundred. That\u2019s just good economics. And if it\u2019s a family of two, and both members of the family make ten thousand dollars, they would have to make out with one car. That would be good economics, although it\u2019s often inconvenient. But so often, haven\u2019t you seen people making five thousand dollars a year and driving a car that costs six thousand? And they wonder why their ends never meet. [laughter] That\u2019s a fact. Now the economists also say that your house shouldn\u2019t cost\u2014if you\u2019re buying a house, it shouldn\u2019t cost more than twice your income. That\u2019s based on the economy and how you would make ends meet. So, if you have an income of five thousand dollars, it\u2019s kind of difficult in this society. But say it\u2019s a family with an income of ten thousand dollars, the house shouldn\u2019t cost much more than twenty thousand. Well, I\u2019ve seen folk making ten thousand dollars, living in a forty- and fifty-thousand-dollar house. And you know they just barely make it. They get a check every month somewhere, and they owe all of that out before it comes in. Never have anything to put away for rainy days. But now the problem is, it is the drum major instinct. And you know, you see people over and over again with the drum major instinct taking them over. And they just live their lives trying to outdo the Joneses. (Amen) They got to get this coat because this particular coat is a little better and a little better-looking than Mary\u2019s coat. And I got to drive this car because it\u2019s something about this car that makes my car a little better than my neighbor\u2019s car. (Amen) I know a man who used to live in a thirty-five-thousand-dollar house. And other people started building thirty-five-thousand-dollar houses, so he built a seventy-five-thousand-dollar house. And then somebody else built a seventy-five-thousand-dollar house, and he built a hundred-thousand-dollar house. And I don\u2019t know where he\u2019s going to end up if he\u2019s going to live his life trying to keep up with the Joneses.\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEmphasis mine up there.\n\nKing\u2019s point was that people shouldn\u2019t be looking to the newest, best car for fulfillment. It\u2019s okay to have the car you have, to enjoy the car you have. It\u2019s okay to have the life you have. What\u2019s important is what you do with it, and how you help others. Materialistic pride divides humanity, makes you think you\u2019re better than your neighbor. We shouldn\u2019t be worried about having the latest and greatest pickup truck. Pride, greed, and the merchants that sell them are the things that ruin us.\n\nAnd to top it off, later on in the speech, King reminded us where we stand as a country:\n\nWe\u2019ve committed more war crimes almost than any nation in the world, and I\u2019m going to continue to say it. And we won\u2019t stop it because of our pride and our arrogance as a nation.\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow so many have missed King\u2019s legacy is tragic, and it\u2019s something more should learn about.\n\nBut, here we are, talking about it now.

But since we here at The Glow Up sit at the intersection of Fashion Week and Black History Month (and Wakanda, obvi), we couldn\u2019t help noticing another trend rising the past few seasons: a surge in blackness-branded clothing we haven\u2019t seen since the early \u201990s (more on that trend to come).\n\n\n\nWhat was really striking to us was the re-emergence of our two primary civil rights icons, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr., as the focus of two clothing lines this season: the Malcolm X Legacy collection, which debuted at Harlem Fashion Week 2018, and recent releases from New York-based skateboarding brand Supreme, whose latest lookbook features clothing emblazoned with MLK\u2019s visage and most famous phrases: \u201cI have a dream\u201d and \u201cWe shall overcome.\u201d\n\nSuffice it to say, reviews on the much-better-known Supreme collection were mixed, especially among The Root crew. Our internal\u2014and anonymous\u2014staff discussions went something like this:\n\n\u201cThis is ridiculous. The King family is a mess for authorizing this.\u201d \u201cCash grab.\u201d \u201cMy beef with it is ... why is it so hideous?

Although I must admit that this morning\u2019s lookbook was sad, and the MLK hoodie was one of the better pieces in a sad way. ... Supreme has honored several blacks in the past, including the great Pam Grier ... Sade, Muhammad Ali, KRS-One, Malcolm X ... MLK fits that mold, even if that all-over print sweatshirt is fugazi.\u201d \u201cThe Sade was fresh. This was a mess. It looked like something I\u2019d be forced to buy if I caught a chill at Jazz Fest ... and I\u2019d stay cold.\u201d \u201cI think MLK on the arms was overkill. Never put MLK on the arms.\u201d \u201cThat sweatshirt was all the velvet paintings and airbrushed backdrops of MLK that ever were.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOK. So that release was considered less than \u201csupreme\u201d around these parts. But not to be outdone, the jewel in the crown that was 2018 Harlem Fashion Week was the debut of the Malcolm X Legacy collection, co-helmed by the six daughters of Malcolm X and Betty Shabazz\u2014Qubilah, Attallah, Ilyasah, Malikah, Gamilah and Malaak Shabazz. Instead of simply licensing their father\u2019s words and image to an existing brand, the Shabazz sisters teamed up with tech company Hingeto and emerging designer Yvonne Jewnell to collaborate on a clothing line that pays homage to their father\u2019s legacy.\n\nThe contemporary urbanwear line features clothing inspired by the 12 principles of Malcolm X, which stressed the importance of human rights, education, economic independence, cultural pride and justice. The Shabazz sisters created the collection in hopes of inspiring a younger generation of activists to follow in their father\u2019s steps.\n\nThe Glow Up\u2019s editorial team (supermodel Veronica Webb and myself) had the pleasure of being front row at the debut of the Malcolm X Legacy collection at the inaugural event of Harlem Fashion Week on Feb. 4, a sold-out runway presentation at the gorgeous Museum of the City of New York. We can vouch for the fact that these are definitely clothes for a new generation of Malcolm X followers\u2014fresh, funky, fashion-forward and sexier than expected.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd while we both enjoyed the presentation, we\u2019ll let you judge for yourselves this round.

It\u2019s also a city where your coat conveys status as much as, if not more than, your clothes; those wet suits Hunte used as underpinnings may have been a nod also to the one-piece ski suits so ubiquitous in the Mile-High City.\n\nHunter has a unique vocabulary when it comes to coats that draws equally from cinched, belted and chained Italian police uniforms; Marcy Projects street style; and the glamour of old Hollywood movies. Hunte\u2019s women make grand entrances and dramatic exits; one particular standout this season was a trench coat with fox-fur patchwork.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut what Hunte does best is updating and reworking his own signature details and patterns. He is known for dressing celebs like Beyonc\u00e9, Halle Berry and Zendaya in buffalo-check ponchos; this season, clear PVC was added as an overlay on the checked pattern to give this soft staple fabric both edge and a modern dimension. (You\u2019ll likely be seeing a lot of PVC this season; it was also utilized by Virgil Abloh in his capsule collection for Jimmy Choo that debuted at New York Fashion Week on Tuesday.)\n\nWhat we saw this season was a modern woman\u2019s uniform for traveling exploring.

The cookout is a mythical place where all are gathered in both Jesus\u2019 (and Allah\u2019s and ... well you get the point) and blackness\u2019s names to celebrate and extol the virtues of both the black experience and black existence.\n\nAt #TheCookout, the sounds of Motown, Stax and Cash Money play endlessly while song breaks are interspersed with snippets of speeches by Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. There\u2019s a Marcus Garvey photo booth, and everybody gets their own plush Black Panther Beanie Baby.\n\nThere\u2019s also the O.J. Simpson dunking booth where nobody misses as O.J. lookalikes splash into the water (in which they cannot swim) all day long.

Glad you asked.\n\n1. Michael Jordan\n\nI just don\u2019t think Michael would ever come. His achievements in basketball are legendary; he will always be mentioned when we talk of greats. However, until recently it seemed that he thought himself a bit above the fray of regular black folks.

Eddie Murphy\n\nEddie could surprise me. Or he could just be like, eh, beneath me. Either is possible.\n\n5. Charles Barkley\n\nHis invitation seems like it\u2019s in flux, but I still think he\u2019d catch an invite, if only so he can make Ernie Johnson his plus-one.

But since we here at The Glow Up sit at the intersection of Fashion Week and Black History Month (and Wakanda, obvi), we couldn\u2019t help noticing another trend rising the past few seasons: a surge in blackness-branded clothing we haven\u2019t seen since the early \u201990s (more on that trend to come).\n\n\n\nWhat was really striking to us was the re-emergence of our two primary civil rights icons, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr., as the focus of two clothing lines this season: the Malcolm X Legacy collection, which debuted at Harlem Fashion Week 2018, and recent releases from New York-based skateboarding brand Supreme, whose latest lookbook features clothing emblazoned with MLK\u2019s visage and most famous phrases: \u201cI have a dream\u201d and \u201cWe shall overcome.\u201d\n\nSuffice it to say, reviews on the much-better-known Supreme collection were mixed, especially among The Root crew. Our internal\u2014and anonymous\u2014staff discussions went something like this:\n\n\u201cThis is ridiculous. The King family is a mess for authorizing this.\u201d \u201cCash grab.\u201d \u201cMy beef with it is ... why is it so hideous? It looks like some shit you\u2019d see for sale on the side of the road ... or at a swamp meet.\u201d [Editor\u2019s note: Yes, she meant \u201cswamp.\u201d] \u201cThere will be no Supreme-bashing on my watch ... aka my favorite brand right now. Although I must admit that this morning\u2019s lookbook was sad, and the MLK hoodie was one of the better pieces in a sad way. ... Supreme has honored several blacks in the past, including the great Pam Grier ... Sade, Muhammad Ali, KRS-One, Malcolm X ... MLK fits that mold, even if that all-over print sweatshirt is fugazi.\u201d \u201cThe Sade was fresh. This was a mess. It looked like something I\u2019d be forced to buy if I caught a chill at Jazz Fest ... and I\u2019d stay cold.\u201d \u201cI think MLK on the arms was overkill. Never put MLK on the arms.\u201d \u201cThat sweatshirt was all the velvet paintings and airbrushed backdrops of MLK that ever were.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOK. So that release was considered less than \u201csupreme\u201d around these parts. But not to be outdone, the jewel in the crown that was 2018 Harlem Fashion Week was the debut of the Malcolm X Legacy collection, co-helmed by the six daughters of Malcolm X and Betty Shabazz\u2014Qubilah, Attallah, Ilyasah, Malikah, Gamilah and Malaak Shabazz. Instead of simply licensing their father\u2019s words and image to an existing brand, the Shabazz sisters teamed up with tech company Hingeto and emerging designer Yvonne Jewnell to collaborate on a clothing line that pays homage to their father\u2019s legacy.\n\nThe contemporary urbanwear line features clothing inspired by the 12 principles of Malcolm X, which stressed the importance of human rights, education, economic independence, cultural pride and justice. The Shabazz sisters created the collection in hopes of inspiring a younger generation of activists to follow in their father\u2019s steps.\n\nThe Glow Up\u2019s editorial team (supermodel Veronica Webb and myself) had the pleasure of being front row at the debut of the Malcolm X Legacy collection at the inaugural event of Harlem Fashion Week on Feb. 4, a sold-out runway presentation at the gorgeous Museum of the City of New York. We can vouch for the fact that these are definitely clothes for a new generation of Malcolm X followers\u2014fresh, funky, fashion-forward and sexier than expected.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd while we both enjoyed the presentation, we\u2019ll let you judge for yourselves this round.

She was recently laid off from a chicken-processing plant and makes ends meet by walking and taking care of her neighbors\u2019 pets. Mary could expand her little business by hiring some workers, but no one in the area would accept a wage she can afford. Mary goes online\u2014to a new kind of international gig economy website, a Fiverr for immigrants\u2014and applies to sponsor a migrant. She enters information about what she needs: someone with rudimentary English skills, no criminal record and an affection for animals. She offers a room in her basement, meals and $5 an hour. (Sponsors under this program would be exempt from paying minimum wage.) The website offers Mary some matches\u2014people living in foreign countries who would like to spend some time in the United States and earn some money. After some back and forth, Mary interviews a woman named Sofia who lives in Paraguay. Sofia, who grew up in a village, has endured hardships that few Americans can imagine. She is eager to earn some money so that she could move to her nation\u2019s capital city and get some vocational training. A few weeks later, Sofia arrives in Wheeling, after taking a one-week training course on American ways. If things don\u2019t work out, the agency that runs the website will find a new match for Sofia, and Mary will find someone new as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyway, I read the entire piece so you don\u2019t have to.

I still don\u2019t think I\u2019ve fully processed or fully understand what impact this movie is going to have on people\u2019s lives. So I\u2019m excited.\u201d \u2014Douriean\n\nJewelry designer and metalsmith Douriean Fletcher\u2014who designs and retails simply as Douriean\u2014is having the kind of breakthrough moment most artists can\u2019t even begin to dream of. Handpicked by friend and legendary costume designer Ruth E. Carter to join the costume team of Black Panther (the two previously worked together on 2016\u2019s Roots), Douriean\u2019s handcrafted jewelry and metalwork adorn the citizens and royalty of Wakanda\u2014perhaps most dazzlingly as the armor and neckpieces of the incredible warrior women of the Dora Milaje.\n\nWatching her own work in action was a thrilling experience, as Douriean told The Glow Up:\n\n\n\nSeeing the movie, it was an absolute joy to see this glistening armor just pop off the screen. ... These Dora characters are the first defense of Wakanda; they\u2019re the ones that defend the honor and the safety of the country. So I think I didn\u2019t really fully process what that meant\u2014that I was creating those pieces\u2014until I saw the movie the other day. The actual craftsmanship of those pieces was a very interesting yet challenging experience ... these pieces have a meaning. They have a specific meaning of who these women are, and what they do for their country. They\u2019re there to be resilient and strong, and to protect Wakanda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m inspired and intrigued by how we choose to represent ourselves as resilient and beautiful and functional, regardless of what we\u2019ve experienced in life.\u201d\n\nDouriean\u2019s handmade, often hand-hammered aesthetic was a perfect match for this newest cinematic corner of the Marvel Universe, which introduces us to the technologically advanced, culturally rich fictional African nation of Wakanda. Douriean, who considers her work not only Afrofuturistic but \u201cAncient Futuristic\u201d or \u201cPrimal Chic,\u201d welcomed the challenge to translate her artistic aesthetic to the big screen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDouriean explained:\n\nI feel like I have a lot of responsibility, first off, to communicate a certain message through my work. I feel like it\u2019s a lot of responsibility, but I think it\u2019s a great position to be in. ... But I think as far as the Marvel Universe, it\u2019s a perfect match because I was able to bring something different to this culture of Wakanda, this fictional country that they had yet to really tap into.\n\nCostume designer Carter agreed, telling The Glow Up that she\u2019d specifically chosen Douriean because she felt strongly that the metal pieces used in Black Panther had to have a \u201chand-tooled African, hand-hammered\u201d aesthetic. That, coupled with director Ryan Coogler\u2019s desire for even the armor to look like beautiful African jewelry, made Douriean the ideal choice. The jewelry designer confessed to us that initially, she held back in deference to the Marvel aesthetic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c[Ruth E. Carter] said, \u2018This isn\u2019t Douriean enough. You have to put more of yourself in it.\u2019 That was exciting. Like, oh, wait, you\u2019re giving me some space to do my thing,\u201d Douriean said.\n\nA Pasadena, Calif., native, Douriean has been creating jewelry since 2010. She is mostly self-taught, save for a three-month metalsmithing class in New Orleans. Having traveled throughout Tanzania and South Africa and now based in Los Angeles, she makes work that \u201cexplores cultural identity, femininity, spirituality and divine power.\u201d When asked where she gleans her inspiration, she told The Glow Up:\n\n\n\nSometimes it\u2019s my story; if I experience something that\u2019s quite challenging, I\u2019ll take inspiration from that\u2014and, sometimes, motivation from those experiences\u2014and put that into a piece. Sometimes I literally just have dreams, and I wake up in the middle of night and sketch them out. And sometimes other people\u2019s stories, or just their essence ... women, we\u2019re very multifaceted creatures. So I\u2019m inspired and intrigued by how we choose to represent ourselves as resilient and beautiful and functional, regardless of what we\u2019ve experienced in life. ... The physique of a woman is very beautiful, and I want\u2014whenever I create something\u2014to be able to adorn someone to where they feel regal and beautiful and powerful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a female metalsmith, Douriean admitted that her eight-year journey has been a challenge, as there aren\u2019t many women in the field, let alone black women. But she credits the obstacles with her growth as an artist and innovator:\n\n\n\nI feel like I\u2019ve been underestimated at times; people are just surprised that I can create what I do, or doubt that I can create what I make. And because it\u2019s so different from what people think when they think of jewelry-making, it\u2019s been a challenge to find my niche and my clientele. Like this whole entire process, like this is the first time\u2014these past two years\u2014where I feel like I\u2019ve finally found my tribe and my clientele of people who can understand and accept my work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith that growth and increasing exposure have come major shifts for Douriean, especially as the officially licensed jewelry designer for both Black Panther and the upcoming Avengers film, which promises to be an even larger production. While creating for mass market raises her exposure and reach, it definitely presented challenges to her typically one-of-a-kind approach to design. According to Douriean:\n\nAs an artist, I like to create one-offs\u2014I like to create one thing, it has a story to it, it means something and it\u2019s for one particular person. To be able to have to expand that, and create a narrative for a group of people, it\u2019s a different way of approaching my work. So, for instance, the Black Panther line ... I created that, number one, for the comic book fan; the young men and women or the young boys and girls who grew up on the comics, who are super excited, who have been waiting for this moment for years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor those of us coveting a piece of Black Panther to take home, the sterling silver Black Panther collection is currently available on Douriean\u2019s website. A collection inspired by Panther villain Killmonger is next, and lastly, a collection inspired by the Dora Milaje, which Douriean will handcraft herself.\n\nThe Glow Up caught a preview of both Lupita Nyong\u2019o and the designer herself at the Marvel Studios Black Panther Welcome to Wakanda New York Fashion Week presentation on Monday.

So, of course, when New York Fashion Week and Black Panther premiere week collided Monday night, there was a presentation inspired by Oscar winner Ruth E. Carter\u2019s costumes from the film.\n\n\n\nThe \u201cWelcome to Wakanda\u201d fashion presentation had guests lined up around West 12th Street in New York City dressed in their most regal Ankara couture to get inside Industria Studios, the fashion-centric studio space and event venue where designs from Chromat, Cushnie et Ochs, Fear of God, Ikir\u00e9 Jones, LaQuan Smith, Sophie Theallet and Tome were on display.\n\nThe immersion into Wakanda began with the walls, covered in leaves that branched out like ivy. At the entrance into the concrete jungle sat the blue Lexus LC 500 used during the film, with slashes from the Black Panther across its hood. Inside the purple-lit studio, seven stunning models posed in bespoke couture designs while standing on a moss-covered stage. Golden thrones were positioned on the stage like arrows on a compass, giving guests the hottest backdrop to flex on the \u2019gram.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Industria really transformed into Wakanda when the stars of Black Panther\u2014Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong\u2019o, Danai Gurira and Winston Duke\u2014held court on the black carpet. Mingling with guests and posing with the models inspired by their characters, the stars lit up the venue, taking laps around the stage and selfies with guests who dined on Wakanda Patties, made of chickpea and roast yam, and Cricket Tarts, made of chocolate-roasted crickets. Guests sipped signature drinks as artist and DJ Heron Preston kept the crowd\u2014and singer Elle Varner\u2014dancing till long past last call. Clearly, it\u2019s lit in Wakanda.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen the bar closed, even after the lights came up and janitors began sweeping up the floor, the crowds still didn\u2019t disperse, wanting to stay in the safe haven of black excellence just a little while longer. But with gift bags from event sponsor Redken in hand, the guests eventually shuffled off into the night, counting down the days till they can get back to the affirming space carved into existence by Black Panther.\n\n\n\nFortunately, the joy of the evening will continue on, as the seven bespoke pieces will be auctioned off by CharityBuzz to benefit the international humanitarian organization Save the Children. And the film-inspired capsule collections that were on display by shoe-and-accessories designer Brother Vellies, Black Panther jewelry and armor designer and official jeweler Douriean, and knitwear designer Josh Bennett are on sale today, Tuesday, for all the fans who want to keep the magic alive. #WakandaForever, indeed!", "keywords": ["designer", "venue", "till", "stage", "welcome", "york", "week", "panther", "black", "wakanda", "bnyfw", "guests"], "polarity": 0.10379182449494952, "subjectivity": 0.4061868686868687},

Sanitation Department. They left their families for a long day of collecting garbage with the full expectation of returning home to them. Instead, as their shifts were about to end and heavy rain poured down around them, the two men were crushed to death in the barrel of a faulty garbage truck.\n\nTheir deaths sparked a revolution that would forever change the trajectory of the civil rights movement. But that day, they were just two men, working through the indignity of starvation wages and torturous working conditions to support their families.\n\nThe truck in which Walker and Cole were killed was one of the six remaining antiquated garbage trucks that were in the process of being phased out of the Sanitation Department\u2019s fleet. The two men were seeking shelter from the rain by standing in the barrel of the truck, where the garbage is pushed to the rear, as the driver and two co-workers rode in the front.\n\n\n\nThen the unimaginable happened.\n\nAt around 4:20 p.m., as the men finished their shift in the predominantly white neighborhood of East Memphis, on the way back to the city dump, somehow the garbage-compression piston on the outdated, faulty truck was triggered.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe motor started racing and the driver stopped and ran around and smashed that button to stop that thing,\u201d co-worker Elester Gregory, who was riding in the truck\u2019s cab, told the Commercial Appeal the next day. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what was happening. It looked to me like one of them almost got out, but he got caught and just fell back in there.\u201d\n\nA white Memphis woman was sitting at her kitchen table when she saw most of the horrific incident take place right outside her window. She called the ambulance.\n\n\u201cIt was horrible,\u201d C.E. Hinson told the Commercial Appeal. \u201cHe was standing there on the end of the truck and suddenly it looked like the big thing [the compression unit] just swallowed him. I didn\u2019t know at the time that someone else had already been crushed in the thing.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe two men were later pronounced dead at Memphis\u2019 John Gaston Hospital.\n\nThe revolution would come, but on Feb. 1, 1968, Robert Walker and Echol Cole were snatched from their families without warning, and the shock and bone-aching grief settled like a suffocating weight on a family and community who loved them. That is the painful tragedy that hummed beneath the surface of a strike that would change the course of history.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn this second installment of 1,300 Men: Memphis Strike \u201968, The Root\u2019s 11-part video series in partnership with the Striking Voices multimedia project, we introduce you to the family of Robert Walker.\n\n\n\nThe Walker family have barely spoken publicly because they have felt intimidated into silence for the past half-century. Black people paid a nonnegotiable, steep price for speaking truth to power in the land of Jim Crow. Today, black people are still targeted for the very same thing, but the Walker family is stepping out on faith to tell their stories.\n\nYou will hear from Robert Walker\u2019s sister, Hattie, who lovingly remembers her big brother as a father figure. You will hear from his son Jack, who has been a Memphis sanitation worker himself for the past 43 years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd you will hear from two of Robert Walker\u2019s daughters, Ruth and Shirley, young girls whose hearts were also crushed that rainy, February day in Memphis.\n\nFollow @TheRoot and @strikingvoices along with the hashtag #1300Men on Twitter as we begin \u201clive\u201d-tweeting historical moments from the strike starting Feb. 1.\n\n", "keywords": ["garbage", "watch", "tragic", "walker", "memphis", "sanitation", "echol", "deaths", "day", "family", "robert", "sparked", "truck", "men", "strike", "thing"], "polarity": -0.06926246592913261, "subjectivity": 0.3089726631393298},

Then, this past Saturday, he celebrated the 25th anniversary of the release of Malcolm X. What\u2019s more, his TV show, She\u2019s Gotta Have It, inspired by his first feature-length film, will debut on Netflix later this week. With all those things bringing his career to mind, I decided to research Lee\u2019s filmography, and two things hit me immediately.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne, dude is mad prolific. Throughout the \u201990s, he virtually made a quality movie every year.\n\n\n\nTwo, his filmography is rather uneven. He has made movies that run the gamut from brilliant (School Daze, Do the Right Thing, Malcolm X) to damn, nigga, really? (Da Sweet Blood of Jesus, Red Hook Summer).\n\n\n\nIn celebration of the 25th anniversary of Malcolm X, his most ambitious film, I will offer a ranking of Spike\u2019s 25 best films.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n25. She Hate Me (2004)\n\nThis is not a bad film\u2014just a messy one. It is unfocused and tries to do too much narratively. When it came out, many were confused. They thought they just did not understand what he was up to. Time has revealed that it was not that we did not understand but, rather, to quote Hov, \u201c\u2019Cause you don\u2019t understand him, it don\u2019t mean that he nice.\u201d\n\n24. Oldboy (2013)\n\nThis is a technically proficient film\u2014it is just unneeded. The original is close to perfect. This is just there.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n23. Miracle at St. Anna (2008)\n\nThis is an ambitious film, but it is overly long. I started watching it when Barack Obama was elected, and when I finished, Donald Trump was in office.\n\n\n\n22. Chi-raq (2015)\n\nLee\u2019s attempt to wrestle with the violence in Chicago is stylish but deeply flawed.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n21. Passing Strange (2008)\n\nMore known for his fictional films, Lee is also an accomplished documentarian. This is a recording of \u201cthe best play to never win a Tony,\u201d written by Stew.\n\n\n\n20. Jim Brown: All-American (2002)\n\nJim Brown is a fascinatingly complicated black man, and Lee\u2019s documentary lays that all bare.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n19. Mike Tyson: Undisputed Truth (2013)\n\nThis film surprised me. Mike Tyson is a tragically flawed yet magnetically charismatic man\u2014Lee films him empathetically.\n\n18. Summer of Sam (1999)\n\nThis tells the story of the 1977 serial murders that took place in New York City. It builds suspense competently, but I have no idea what Lee was trying to say with the film. His visuals are jarring, yet what good are the chills if the story leaves so much to be desired?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n17. Get on the Bus (1996)\n\nThis story about black men on a bus to the Million Man March flirts dangerously with emotional manipulation, but the performances of Ossie Davis, Charles S. Dutton, Bernie Mac, Andre Braugher and others save the film from sentimentality.\n\n\n\n16. Clockers (1995)\n\nAn examination of the interconnectedness of those who investigate crimes and those who commit them, Lee\u2019s Clockers is a precursor to The Wire in form and style.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n15. If God Is Willing and de Creek Don\u2019t Rise (2010)\n\nThis sequel to Lee\u2019s brilliant When the Levees Broke is haunting. It showed us just how much work remained to be done after Hurricane Katrina while examining the impact of the BP oil spill of 2010. His ability to construct a vibrant narrative using the documentary format is on full display in this HBO film.\n\nThe remaining films are what made Spike Lee Spike Lee. The following are all legitimately great films worthy of deep examination and deconstruction. My ranking of his top 14 films changes almost yearly, but I am willing to go to blows with anyone who denies their brilliance\u2014even while I am willing to admit that they are not all flawless in their execution.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n14. 25th Hour (2002)\n\nA rarity for Lee in that almost exclusively white actors populate it, this film grapples brilliantly with the moral nihilism that we all felt in the wake of 9/11.\n\n\n\n13. Jungle Fever (1991)\n\nThis felt like Lee just wanted to say something about interracial relationships\u2014essentially that they would not work. But yo, this movie is riveting. The directorial flair, the acting, the music and the fact that \u201cjungle fever\u201d is now a part of the public lexicon places this firmly in the upper echelon of his filmography.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n12. Inside Man (2006)\n\nDenzel Washington, Lee\u2019s frequent collaborator, is electric and makes the film work, but at this point in his career, this is a movie that I did not think Lee would make. A fun potboiler that shows us what is possible when Lee cuts back on his self-indulgent tendencies and focuses on a narrative.\n\n\n\n11. Bamboozled (2000)\n\nThis satire examines the vicious legacy of blackface in light of contemporary depictions of black Americans in popular media. It took me years to fully appreciate what Lee was up to, but now, looking back as a philosopher of race, I see that Lee\u2019s film is both prophetic about our contemporary moment and eternally relevant.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. The Original Kings of Comedy (2000)\n\nThis film turned D.L. Hughley, Cedric the Entertainer, Steve Harvey and the late Bernie Mac into household names. Lee\u2019s swooping camera and clinical approach to the art of comedy centers the work that goes into the seeming effortlessness of the black expression of the art form.\n\n9. Mo\u2019 Better Blues (1990)\n\nMy favorite of Lee\u2019s films uses the medium of jazz as a lens to meditate on the plight of black artists. Patriarchy and emotional abuse that are never fully critiqued keep Mo\u2019 Better Blues from being higher on the list, but the score and the performances of Joie Lee, Spike\u2019s sister, and Denzel elevate this otherwise small film.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. She\u2019s Gotta Have It (1986)\n\nLee\u2019s first feature-length film is a French new-wave examination of the sexual double standards faced by black women filtered through Italian neorealism. His willingness to experiment with form, a major reason that his later films are not as successful, is how he made his name as a filmmaker. This film is now streaming on Netflix, and I am interested to see how the streaming service will update and expand upon the foundation Lee laid in its upcoming series.\n\n\n\n7. He Got Game (1998)\n\nLee knows basketball. A lifelong Knicks fan, he is known for his courtside antics cheering for a team that has not won a championship since Richard Nixon was in the White House. This film, both a love letter to the game and a searing indictment of the corruption that surrounds it, boasts a great Washington performance and a surprisingly competent one from Ray Allen.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. 4 Little Girls (1996)\n\nHeartbreaking and raw, Lee\u2019s documentary about how the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Ala., still haunts the family members of the four girls who died that day should have won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature that year. It let us know that Lee was not just a maker of fictional films and that he was a force to be reckoned with as a documentarian.\n\n\n\n5. When the Levees Broke: A Requiem in Four Acts (2006)\n\nThis is Lee\u2019s magnum opus as a documentarian. It tells the story of Hurricane Katrina and shows how the U.S. government failed the people of the 9th Ward in every respect. It is required viewing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. School Daze (1988)\n\nBlack Greek organizations, magical realism, an HBCU football team that loses in embarrassing fashion during homecoming, Afrocentrism in tension with respectability politics, a song about colorism in the black community\u2014School Daze is everything.\n\n\n\n3. Crooklyn (1994)\n\nLee\u2019s most emotionally resonant film is an autobiographical story about a black family in the 1970s. For many it is their favorite, but the only reason it is not higher on my list is that the next two are so much more ambitious\u2014but depending on the day, this could easily find itself in the No. 1 spot.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Do the Right Thing (1989)\n\nMany consider this Lee\u2019s greatest film. It is a brilliant examination of black rage in the wake of the absurdity imposed by white supremacist police violence, a theme that still has resonance today. In fact, many were concerned that black folks would riot because of the climactic scenes. And yet this is a strikingly beautiful film. His frequent cinematographer Ernest Dickerson seizes every opportunity to use the lens to create striking images. This could be No. 1 if not for the sheer audacity of the film Lee made 25 years ago last week ...\n\n\n\n1. Malcolm X (1992)\n\nWhat can I add that has not already been written about this film? Washington should have won the Oscar. Lee should have won the Oscar. Angela Bassett should have won the Oscar. Whoever was the conk-hair consultant should have won an Oscar.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLee\u2019s depiction of the legendary historical figure was flawed because he used The Autobiography of Malcolm X as a foundation for the narrative, but that does not take away from the power of the film. He needed the help of Oprah Winfrey, Magic Johnson, Prince, Janet Jackson, Michael Jordan and other prominent black folks to finish the film, and I\u2019m glad they came through financially. This is Lee\u2019s best film. The one he was born to make.\n\n\n\nHe is not a perfect filmmaker\u2014I\u2019m still lost for what I should think about Red Hook Summer\u2014but when he is on his game, he is among the best filmmakers in America.", "keywords": ["lee", "film", "won", "best", "25", "lees", "movies", "x", "films", "spike", "work", "black", "malcolm", "ranked"], "polarity": 0.1633188557005125, "subjectivity": 0.4983504414717432},

In Pittsburgh alone, there are at least 26 different grades of whiteness, including garden-variety Yinzer whiteness, Appalachian-adjacent whiteness, well-meaning Patagonia whiteness, Lululemon whiteness and Ben Roethlisberger.\n\nAnd sometimes, as in the story about Belen Aldecosea\u2014the Florida woman who, when allegedly told that she wasn\u2019t allowed to bring her emotional-support hamster on a plane, allegedly flushed said hamster down the toilet\u2014the levels of whiteness converge to form a whiteness souffl\u00e9. A whiteness manicotti. A whiteness Thai fried rice.\n\nAnyway, there are too many levels of whiteness in this story to list at one time, so I\u2019ll just name 10.\n\n1. The fact that she has an emotional-support animal. Because the only emotional 0-support animals black people get are lice in prison bunk beds.\n\n2. The fact that her emotional-support animal is a fucking hamster. Hamsters are cute and great and all, but there\u2019s nothing about a hamster that has ever made me think, \u201cI wish that hamster would give me a hug.\u201d This must have been a charismatic-ass hamster. The Mahershala Ali of hamsters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. The fact that she attempted to bring a gotdamn rodent on a plane. The bulk of my adult life has been spent intentionally avoiding enclosed places where rodents might be. I\u2019ve never, ever, ever, ever been in a place and thought, \u201cYou know what this space needs? More rodents.\u201d\n\n4. Again, the fact that she attempted to bring a gotdamn rodent on a plane. I\u2019m so wary of airport security that I practically fly naked now and my only carry-on is a ziplock bag, and she\u2019s trying to get gotdamn rats through the X-ray machine.\n\n5. The fact that, after being told, \u201cNo, you cannot bring this rat on the plane with you, you silly motherfucker,\u201d she reportedly flushed it down the toilet. Apparently, her rationale was that this was a humane way to get rid of it. But on my list of terrible ways to die, drowning to death in an airport toilet is pretty damn near the top. Also, why not just let him loose in a Chick-fil-A or something? Of course, he\u2019d probably get caught and killed, but at least he\u2019d die with a full stomach.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAND IF THIS ANIMAL IS SO IMPORTANT TO YOU, WHY DON\u2019T YOU JUST LEAVE THE AIRPORT AND CATCH A GOTDAMN MEGABUS?\n\n6.

Samantha Black, the Brooklyn, N.Y.-based designer of ready-to-wear line Sammy B., can tell you: \u201cMy phone was blowing up.\u201d\n\nWhy? While Black was asleep, dreaming up sexy leisurewear worthy of Queen Bey to wear on her private jet, Instagram caught fire. Zerina Akers, one of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s stylists\u2014as well as a friend of Black\u2019s\u2014had styled the star in a Sammy B. two-piece neoprene sweatsuit with a belted kimono-style Flatbush jacket ($150) and skinny Tony pop track pant ($110) in burgundy with contrasting pink athletic stripes.\n\nHearing the news, Black screamed out loud and then ran to check her website. The $260 two-piece sweatsuit had sold out within hours\u2014with 150 orders pending.\n\nBlack, who also happens to be model-gorgeous, is a two-time Project Runway contestant, competing in season 11 and All-Stars season 4. My dear friend Isaac Mizrahi, who judged her Sammy B. creations during the series, described her work to me as \u201clike Helmut Lang\u2014if his style was slightly more feminine.\u201d\n\nSince Black has her clothes handmade at a family-owned factory in Brooklyn, she had to shut down her website immediately and hustle to gather all the fabric she could find to fulfill the Beyhive\u2019s needs. What is it about that sweatsuit that\u2019s got everyone so hot?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think people loved it because for $260 you could get something Beyonc\u00e9 wore,\u201d she told me.\n\nNo sooner was she up and running again than fast-fashion knock-off artists Fashion Nova produced a copy of the Sammy B. two-piece sweatsuit, even making the unusual move of pricing the ensemble significantly higher than the designer had priced her own handmade version. Imitation may be the highest form of flattery, but for struggling young designers, it\u2019s tantamount to a poison kiss.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack Twitter swooped in to to defend against the appropriators, migrating to Instagram to flood Fashion Nova\u2019s page, only to have their 30 comments vanish without reply. Meanwhile, sales slowed at Sammy B., which was no match for the more than 10 million Instagram followers scouring Fashion Nova for celebrity look-alike outfits that hit the market, sometimes within hours of appearing on the red carpet.\n\nSamantha Black via Instagram Samantha Black via Instagram 1 / 2\n\n\n\nHaving worked as a denim designer for top-selling contemporary brands like Aeropostale, Kenneth Cole, Jordache and Jessica Simpson, Black is no stranger to the wear and tear of the rag trade. She credits the Beyonc\u00e9 push with bringing in the funding she needed to finish the branding for her company.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe next move? Taking the clothes on the road to pop-up shops around the country, with the first one planned at the headquarters of BuzzFeed in New York City.\n\nEven though being knocked off was a setback, Black knows that being blessed by Beyonc\u00e9 was a giant leap forward, one she\u2019s ready to take advantage of while the crowd is still looking her way.\n\nCelebrity is the engine that propels designer business forward; to date, Issa Rae, Yara Shahidi and Fantasia have all worn Black\u2019s clothes.

But since we here at The Glow Up sit at the intersection of Fashion Week and Black History Month (and Wakanda, obvi), we couldn\u2019t help noticing another trend rising the past few seasons: a surge in blackness-branded clothing we haven\u2019t seen since the early \u201990s (more on that trend to come).\n\n\n\nWhat was really striking to us was the re-emergence of our two primary civil rights icons, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr., as the focus of two clothing lines this season: the Malcolm X Legacy collection, which debuted at Harlem Fashion Week 2018, and recent releases from New York-based skateboarding brand Supreme, whose latest lookbook features clothing emblazoned with MLK\u2019s visage and most famous phrases: \u201cI have a dream\u201d and \u201cWe shall overcome.\u201d\n\nSuffice it to say, reviews on the much-better-known Supreme collection were mixed, especially among The Root crew. Our internal\u2014and anonymous\u2014staff discussions went something like this:\n\n\u201cThis is ridiculous. The King family is a mess for authorizing this.\u201d \u201cCash grab.\u201d \u201cMy beef with it is ... why is it so hideous? It looks like some shit you\u2019d see for sale on the side of the road ... or at a swamp meet.\u201d [Editor\u2019s note: Yes, she meant \u201cswamp.\u201d] \u201cThere will be no Supreme-bashing on my watch ... aka my favorite brand right now. Although I must admit that this morning\u2019s lookbook was sad, and the MLK hoodie was one of the better pieces in a sad way. ... Supreme has honored several blacks in the past, including the great Pam Grier ... Sade, Muhammad Ali, KRS-One, Malcolm X ... MLK fits that mold, even if that all-over print sweatshirt is fugazi.\u201d \u201cThe Sade was fresh. This was a mess. It looked like something I\u2019d be forced to buy if I caught a chill at Jazz Fest ... and I\u2019d stay cold.\u201d \u201cI think MLK on the arms was overkill. Never put MLK on the arms.\u201d \u201cThat sweatshirt was all the velvet paintings and airbrushed backdrops of MLK that ever were.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOK. So that release was considered less than \u201csupreme\u201d around these parts. But not to be outdone, the jewel in the crown that was 2018 Harlem Fashion Week was the debut of the Malcolm X Legacy collection, co-helmed by the six daughters of Malcolm X and Betty Shabazz\u2014Qubilah, Attallah, Ilyasah, Malikah, Gamilah and Malaak Shabazz. Instead of simply licensing their father\u2019s words and image to an existing brand, the Shabazz sisters teamed up with tech company Hingeto and emerging designer Yvonne Jewnell to collaborate on a clothing line that pays homage to their father\u2019s legacy.\n\nThe contemporary urbanwear line features clothing inspired by the 12 principles of Malcolm X, which stressed the importance of human rights, education, economic independence, cultural pride and justice. The Shabazz sisters created the collection in hopes of inspiring a younger generation of activists to follow in their father\u2019s steps.\n\nThe Glow Up\u2019s editorial team (supermodel Veronica Webb and myself) had the pleasure of being front row at the debut of the Malcolm X Legacy collection at the inaugural event of Harlem Fashion Week on Feb. 4, a sold-out runway presentation at the gorgeous Museum of the City of New York. We can vouch for the fact that these are definitely clothes for a new generation of Malcolm X followers\u2014fresh, funky, fashion-forward and sexier than expected.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd while we both enjoyed the presentation, we\u2019ll let you judge for yourselves this round.

Carter\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 reads like a list of iconic favorites from contemporary black cinema. In the 30 years since her first film, Spike Lee\u2019s 1988 hit, School Daze, the Oscar- and Emmy-nominated costume designer has amassed more than 60 film and television credits, including I\u2019m Gonna Git You Sucka (1988); Do the Right Thing (1989); Mo\u2019 Better Blues (1990); House Party 2 (1991); Jungle Fever (1991); The Five Heartbeats (1991); Malcolm X (1992); What\u2019s Love Got to Do With It (1993); Crooklyn (1994); Clockers (1995); B*A*P*S (1997); Rosewood (1997); Amistad (1997); Love & Basketball (2000); Shaft (2000); Bamboozled (2000); Black Dynamite (2009); Sparkle (2012); The Butler (2013); Selma (2014) and Marshall (2017), not to mention Being Mary Jane and the recent reboot of Roots (2016).\n\nNow Carter is stunning us once again with her work in the most anticipated film of the year, Black Panther, her 40th film and first superhero narrative (unless you count Malcolm X). The Glow Up was blessed with the opportunity to speak with her during the flurry of publicity for this groundbreaking film while she took a rare timeout in Cape Town, South Africa. It proved a fitting setting to discuss how she helped create the fictional African country of Wakanda, and how it feels to quietly be one of the architects of black cultural collective consciousness. Ever humble, the now legendary designer told us:\n\nI always felt a responsibility to be authentic and real with depicting the culture. ... You look at enough research, you know the people. They\u2019re your relatives, they\u2019re your family. And so, collectively, when [I] look at my work, I just feel proud that I had some consistency with my approach to all of them. There was never one that I felt wasn\u2019t important for us to learn from. I was challenged each time to really get it right. ... That\u2019s kind of been my journey. And so when I look back at everything, I feel a sense of accomplishment and pride that Black Panther has kind of brought me full circle. I feel like I traveled from slavery with Roots and Amistad. And I went through the Depression with Rosewood in the \u201920s. I did Selma in the \u201950s. With Malcolm X, it was the \u201920s all the way through the \u201960s, and then I got a little \u201970s here and there with some funny ones like Black Dynamite. And then Black Panther came along, and now I\u2019m circling right back to Africa. So I actually feel like I closed the circle a little bit ... and I think they all helped to connect African history and African-American history. I\u2019m hoping for that.\n\nCarter, who has made history of her own as the first African American to be nominated for an Academy Award in costume design\u2014first for Malcolm X and again for Amistad\u2014ventured into new territory for her first Marvel film. In a stroke of luck, she learned she\u2019d gotten the job while working on Marshall, the Thurgood Marshall biopic starring future T\u2019Challa, Chadwick Boseman, directed by Black Panther comic writer Reginald Hudlin.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m like, you know how lucky is this? I get to study [Chadwick\u2019s] body; I get to ask Reggie questions about the Black Panther concept,\u201d Carter said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut even that recon couldn\u2019t fully prepare Carter for the Marvel experience, working with a team of five illustrators and a huge crew to bring the citizens of Wakanda to life. It was also the first time she had to design with movie merchandise in mind\u2014including action figures\u2014which meant that unlike Carter\u2019s previous work, many of the major costumes, like T\u2019Challa\u2019s iconic suit, were already well-defined. Instead, her role was to bring authenticity to characters that the fans of Black Panther have previously known only as illustrations, as she told The Glow Up: \u201cOnce I got the framework, we did a lot of experimentation. ... It\u2019s kind of like they gave me a coloring book and a big box of crayons.\u201d\n\nThat experimentation involved extensive research by Carter\u2019s team of four, exploring the ancient peoples of Africa\u2014including the Zulu, Maasai, Himba, Xhosa and the Turkana, which inspired the beautiful beading and neckpieces of the Dora Milaje. (Notably, Carter tries to steer clear of the word \u201ctribe\u201d because of its colonialist overtones, preferring to simply call each group of people by its name.)\n\nIn doing so, her team divided Wakanda into districts, according to a \u201cbible\u201d of sorts composed by director Ryan Coogler and production designer Hannah Beachler, that outlined both the story and layout of the fictional country. Said Carter:\n\nIt was an incredible piece of work; it was an incredible notebook that really forged us all so far ahead, because we were all working from the same nucleus ... there\u2019s different [communities] of Wakanda, and that bible that they did really outlined what parts of Wakanda were what. [For example] if you take any city, like New York, and you divide it by, you know, midtown, Brooklyn, the Village, NYU area, uptown, Columbia, Harlem, you kind of have a good sense of how Wakanda is broken up, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to Carter\u2019s core team, she also employed locals in South Africa and Ghana to search out antiques that would inspire the handmade feel she strongly felt Black Panther\u2019s costumes needed to have. Following Coogler\u2019s request that even the armor of the Dora Milaje feel like jewelry, Carter also brought on board friend and jeweler Douriean, who specializes in Afrofuturistic, hand-tooled, hand-hammered pieces, many of which have been worn by cast members during the film\u2019s premieres and press. Douriean is also the creator of Black Panther\u2019s officially licensed line of jewelry.\n\nAnd while Carter doesn\u2019t describe the experience as a seamless one, she credits Marvel for helping her realize the vision; even when some of the challenges of bringing Wakanda to life proved daunting:\n\nI had the greatest support from Marvel. The head executives, they never wavered. I never, ever felt\u2014and you know, every costume designer has at some point on a show felt like, \u201cThey\u2019re going to fire me, I know it. I\u2019m going to be fired tonight.\u201d We all go through that. And even though I may have had those thoughts, they were few and far between because I felt like I was supported 100 percent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney Marvel/Disney 1 / 15\n\nCarter is no stranger to making even the improbable possible; in her days as a student at Hampton University, she created a costume-design curriculum for herself after finding that there was nothing available to foster her budding talent.

For this collection, Jean-Raymond collaborated with both Reebok and \u201990s hip-hop brand Cross Colours, leveraging big-brand distribution and recognition for the heavy financial lifting required to bring a fully realized collection to market\u2014and as a vehicle for some seriously good clothes.\n\nThese are clothes that don\u2019t need nostalgia to usher them forward, but instead are forward-thinking in using both patriotism and the Western theme that\u2019s become a dominant trend this New York Fashion Week as a flashpoint for conversation about the current political landscape and how African Americans continue to define the history of this country.\n\nJohn Lamparski/Getty Images John Lamparski/Getty Images John Lamparski/Getty Images John Lamparski/Getty Images John Lamparski/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Frazer Harrison/Getty Images 1 / 22\n\nDown the runway came loose button-down shirts paired with stovepipe leather trousers, top-stitched patchwork suits (in a nod to both denim and quilting bees) and elegant, crystal-pleated pants that elevated baggy trousers to a whole new level.

For Pyer Moss, designer Jean-Raymond did well to channel Wild Bill Pickett, the early-20th-century black cowboy who invented bulldogging\u2014where rodeo riders literally take the bull by the horns and wrestle it to the ground. That, coupled with the use of a blown-up Stars and Stripes motif on blanket-sized scarves and then again in furry coat linings, seemed both a subversive statement and also a declaration of love for America and all that our country has the potential to be.\n\nSince the label\u2019s inception, Pyer Moss has composed clothes like hip-hop songs\u2014sampling beloved nostalgic influences like Cross Colours\u2014with whom designer Jean-Raymond confirmed to Vogue that a full collection is on the way. Until then, we can swoon over his current collection\u2019s mix of floor-length fun furs over hoodies and joggers for the weekend, and, for the office, patchwork jackets over tuck-pleated, high-waisted pants that give the illusion of chaps.

She\u2019s trying in that way your sister-in-law from Minnesota tried to make cornbread last Thanksgiving. She\u2019s trying in the way your high school teacher thought it would be cool to rap about fractions after he saw Freedom Writers.\n\nIt\u2019s not Evans\u2019 fault that her campaign may just be a stalking horse for white Georgia Democrats who fear a black gubernatorial nominee. It\u2019s not her fault that she\u2019s up against Stacey Abrams, who is running to be the first black female governor in America, who is a former legislator, lawyer and author who\u2019s been praised on Samantha Bee\u2019s Full Frontal and in Cosmopolitan and Glamour magazines.\n\nNope, Stacey Evans has every right to run her unseasoned campaign to the best of her ability. What she does NOT have the right to do is violate the black church during Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s holiday by putting herself in MLK blackface, then blaming her black opponent. In Georgia, we\u2019ve officially moved from the \u201cBless your heart\u201d stage to \u201cWhat were you thinking?\u201d\n\nOn the Sunday before Martin Luther King Jr. Day, candidate Stacey Evans attended King\u2019s historic Ebenezer Baptist Church and filmed a campaign commercial that was posted on the campaign Instagram.\n\nThis is arguably the most tone-deaf and racially offensive commercial since Kendall Jenner solved racism with a Pepsi. The commercial has been roundly dragged, not just for being racially offensive but also for demonstrating the worst kind of Democratic white-progressive virtue signaling. Do white Democrats still think you can show up at black events, shake a few hands, clap out of rhythm and wrap up the black vote? You\u2019re running against Stacey Abrams, not Roy Moore; you have to step your game up, Mrs. Evans. Heck, Ben Carson even spoke at Ebenezer that day, so clearly just showing up at church doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re a first-round pick in the racial draft.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven worse, the campaign filmed the service without parishioners\u2019 consent, and plenty of people were surprised to see that they\u2019d been used like props. Of course, the film quality is so bad, they might\u2019ve confused Evans\u2019 campaign team for WorldStar. However, the crusted top of this mayonnaise sandwich is the final image, where MLK is superimposed onto Evans\u2019 face like she downloaded the \u201cMLK Me\u201d app.\n\nThat\u2019s political blackface. Who doesn\u2019t know in 2018 that blackface isn\u2019t OK? Yes, the video was quickly taken down, but where are Evans\u2019 people? Because she clearly needs more of them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA gaffe like this is usually indicative of a campaign that either has no black people on staff or has ones there that nobody listens to. That is not the case with the Evans campaign. The videographer, Nick Nelson, is black; her main campaign manager, Candice Franklin, is black; and she has a few black surrogates. However, when I spoke to them, none of these people seemed to have any idea how this video got made. So either Evans\u2019 Instagram has been hacked by a rogue supporter or somebody is lying.\n\n\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have anything to do with the video,\u201d state Rep. Dar\u2019Shun Kendrick (D-Lithonia), a known surrogate of the Evans campaign, told The Root. \u201cBut it\u2019s my understanding that the MLK image was photoshopped. I think there was some photoshopping going on.\u201d\n\nI then spoke to LaDawn Jones, former legislator and self-proclaimed \u201cstrong\u201d Evans surrogate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI found it inspiring and uplifting,\u201d she said, then eventually admitted that she could see why some found the Evans-to-MLK image \u201cupsetting.\u201d\n\n\n\nEven Jeff DiSantis, one of the top managers of the Evans campaign, wouldn\u2019t speak on the record about the video, releasing a statement instead. The key sections are below:\n\n\n\nThe Abrams campaign has decided to distort a video made by the campaign\u2019s digital company. As is usual in modern campaigns, they accompany Stacey to events so that the campaign can share our activities with the public. The digital company\u2019s camera was one of many cameras recording the service. All images and sounds come from what happened during the service, including the music and the speakers. While the Abrams campaign is trying to divide our state, the Evans campaign will continue to seek the vote of every Georgian who wants to bring hope back to Georgia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn short, none of the African-American campaign surrogates seem to know how this video was magically made, but suggest some nefarious photoshopping, and the campaign itself blames Abrams for distorting the imagery. I guess we can add computer hacker to the accusations the Evans campaign has thrown at Abrams.\n\nEvans\u2019 merry band of enablers in the press have been bending over backward to paint this commercial in the most charitable way possible. Shilling is a tough job. Greg Bluestein of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution tried to play the MLK commercial off like it was just a campaign \u201ccontroversy,\u201d conveniently neglecting to mention that it was Ebenezer Baptist Church itself that demanded the video be taken down. Lee Fang of The Intercept chimed in to lecture black people and cape for oppressed white progressives, completely and obtusely missing the point as usual (I wonder why\u2014oh wait, NOW I remember).\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhite candidates appropriating Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s image is not new or particularly rare. Catherine Templeton, a white Republican woman running for governor in South Carolina, is a Steve Bannon-loving, Charleston, S.C.-church-massacre-denying proud daughter of the Confederacy but had no problem superimposing her campaign logo over MLK. It\u2019s disgusting but predictable. Every white Republican and many white Democrats have done it at some point.\n\nIn fact, I don\u2019t think Evans had any ill intentions, but that\u2019s part of the problem with wannabe white \u201cprogressives.\u201d They still see African Americans as sheeple who can be bought with an afternoon of swaying and paying lip service to King\u2019s ideals. Georgia deserves better, and the black folks in Evans\u2019 campaign who enable this kind of thinking should have their cards revoked.\n\nYou can celebrate MLK any way you wish, but what you\u2019re not gon\u2019 do\u2014without significant draggage, at least\u2014is use MLK as blackface and then, when you get caught, blame black folks. Mistakes happen; take your L and keep it moving. The Evans campaign has every right to try to reach black voters with policy and speeches.

He first won our hearts with his memorable performances on Project Runway, where he threw shade like no other and cut his way to the top, one fierce and fabulous frock at a time. Now in his 10th year as head of his own label, the most successful graduate of the Project Runway franchise has built his success on dressing women of all colors, shapes and sizes and fully diversifying his runway presentations into inspirational, aspirational and attainable symbols of beauty and style.\n\nThough Siriano himself is as petite as they come, he knows that the fashion struggle is real for people whose proportions, personalities or orientations are not the \u201cnorm\u201d on the retail floor or red carpet. Maybe that\u2019s why he\u2019s been so nimble at dressing die-hard fans like EGOT Whoopi Goldberg, who sat front-row at his show Saturday, along with rap \u201cit\u201d girl Cardi B, dressed head to toe in a money-green suit with a white mink stole tossed over her shoulder for good measure. Both were there to applaud the 10th year of his superluxe ready-to-wear collection.\n\nBut Siriano\u2019s work just isn\u2019t for the rich and famous; we can all walk in designer shoes from the collection he personally designs for Payless, or slide into a sheath from his ongoing collaboration with plus-size retailer Lane Bryant. Siriano does runway regality at real prices just as well as he does high-fashion fantasy, but what was on his runway yesterday was simply one wow moment after another.\n\nBrilliant colors ruled Siriano\u2019s fall-winter collection\u2014crimson reds, fuchsia pinks and Cinderella blue, rippling with ruffles from shoulders to hem, and tiers of tulle that opened up from the back of the dresses like the plumage of a magnificent African bird. Even the suits were lush\u2014made of velvet embedded with tiny crystals, which struck the perfect balance between flashy details and froufrou femininity \u2014something that I\u2019m all for, by the way\u2014especially when those elements are rendered with witty restraint and a sophisticated silhouette.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOrange Is the New Black\u2019s Danielle Brooks walks the runway for Christian Siriano.

She roared. She conquered.\n\n\n\nActress Viola Davis, who has been thrilling audiences with her passionate, deeply felt words since at least 2017 (or that year she made us all cry at the Oscars), gave no less at the Women\u2019s March 2018 in Los Angeles this past Saturday.\n\nDecked out in a leather jacket; big, beautiful hair; and the fierceness of a life lived (and don\u2019t @ me for talking about how she looked\u2014at 52, she looks too damn good!), Davis gave thousands of pink-pussy-hat wearers something to talk\u2014and think\u2014about.\n\nDavis opened by saying, \u201cIn the words of my fellow American Malcolm X, I\u2019m gonna make it plain.\u201d\n\nOK, Viola. We are listening. Because opening with Malcolm means it\u2019s about to go down.\n\nShe followed up by calling the United States the greatest nation on earth, but reminding us: \u201cIn 1877, America put laws in place called the Jim Crow laws,\u201d and those laws \u201crestricted the rights of quadroons, octoroons, blacks, Hispanics, Malays ... they restricted medical, relationships, education, in all, \u201cthey restricted life.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavis also quoted Martin Luther King Jr., and then she got animated, telling the crowd that the price of freedom is certainly not free.\n\n\u201cWe only move forward when it doesn\u2019t cost us anything,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m here today saying that no one and nothing can be great unless it costs you something.\u201d\n\nShe noted that women of color, if they are raped or sexually assaulted before the age of 18, are 66 percent more likely to be raped or sexually assaulted again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSeventy percent of girls who are sexually trafficked are girls of color,\u201d Davis added. \u201cThey are coming out of the foster care system, they are coming out of poverty. It is a billion-dollar business.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe, like Oprah, called the names of activist and organizer Fannie Lou Hamer; of Recy Taylor, who was gang-raped by six white men; of Rosa Parks; of activist Tarana Burke\u2014saying their work, their sacrifice, cost them something.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNothing and no one can be great without a cost,\u201d she said.\n\nDavis closed by getting personal and saying that her testimony was that of one of those young girls of color who grew up in poverty and who was sexually violated:\n\nI am always introduced as an award-winning actor. But my testimony is one of poverty. My testimony is one of being sexually assaulted and very much seeing a childhood that was robbed from me. And I know that every single day, when I think of that, I know that the trauma of those events are still with me today. And that\u2019s what drives me to the voting booth. That\u2019s what allows me to listen to the women who are still in silence. That\u2019s what allows me to even be a citizen on this planet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then, hammering the point home, she said ain\u2019t nobody free till we all free.\n\n\u201cAs we live on earth, we\u2019ve got to bring everyone with us,\u201d said Davis.\n\nBrava, Ms. Davis.

I didn't \u2014 and still don't \u2014 believe Spike had to end this epic and panoramic classic with a saccharine 90-second afterschool special. But it is also (arguably) its most effective. Because of the obvious emotional resonance of having a group of Black boys and girls say those words aloud on film. And also because it makes sense on both a macro (Malcolm X's legacy lives on) and a micro sense. Malcolm X wasn't just an everyman. He was literally every man. A poor kid, a pimp, a thief, a transplant, a porter, a prisoner, a bartender, a numbers runner, a preacher, a prophet; it was like he packed 12 different lives into 39 years of life. His life practically begs you to find a connection \u2014 any connection \u2014 to him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis scene also comes to mind every Martin Luther King Day, the annual holiday for every racist (subtle and overt), every idiot (subtle and overt), and every racist idiot (clueless and disingenuous) who doesn't want to admit he's a racist idiot to attempt to connect himself to Dr. King's legacy. I imagine them imagining themselves all sitting in a classroom \u2014 Tea Party members and Fox News anchors; Breitbart editors and Michelle Malkin; crossing guards and that person on Facebook who you went to middle school with \u2014 sitting hand in hand as they repeat \"I am MLK!\" to each other. Because, of course, Dr. King was a Republican! And he believed all lives matter! And in judging people by the content of their character and shit, which means he definitely would have hated affirmative action. And Obama. Oh, Dr. King would have hated Obama.\n\nOf course, they don't realize that if Dr. King walked into a classroom full of these dangerously bigoted sociopaths, dog-whistling sycophants, ass-backward extremists, and low-information nincompoops, he would have walked out of that room. And then he would have returned with a firehouse and sprayed the fuck out of everyone in it.\n\nActually, l misspoke. I'm certain some of these people do in fact realize that what they believe and what Dr. King believed are at two separate ends of the spectrum. Connecting themselves to him is just a transparently counterfeit way to pander politically and give themselves an \"I'm not racist\" alibi. But I'm sure there are some who do truly believe what they're saying is true. That what they believe is aligned with what Dr. King believed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd for those people, I want to deliver a message.

Artist Kehinde Wiley portrays the former president as concerned, probing, and calm, with just the faintest hint of a smirk playing across his lips; he is settled within a radiant, repeating wall of foliage, faintly obscured where his shoes nestle into the overgrowth. As presidential portraits go, it\u2019s bold, opinionated, and utterly modern. Alongside Amy Sherald\u2019s painting of Michelle Obama, it also happens to be the first commission to a black artist from the National Portrait Gallery.\n\n\n\nAccordingly, Sean Hannity does not like it. In point of fact, he thinks there is \u201csecret sperm\u201d on the painting, and it frightens him. This is not a euphemism; he thinks that Wiley painted jizz onto Obama\u2019s face. In a since-deleted post entitled \u201cPORTRAIT PERVERSION\u201d published today on his blog, an author mysteriously dubbed \u201cHannity Staff\u201d writes:\n\nControversy surrounding Kehinde Wiley\u2019s wildly non-traditional portrait of the Commander-in-Chief broke out within minutes of its unveiling; with industry insiders claiming the artist secretly inserted his trademark technique -concealing images of sperm within his paintings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you\u2019re hoping for more explanation than that, you will not find it in the article, which is still available to read via cache. It moves on from there to note that the artist once sardonically used the phrase \u201ckill whitey\u201d in a New York magazine profile, which at least has the virtue of being true, unlike the claim that he put sperm in his painting of Barack Obama, which is objectively not true.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look, just to be sure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYep, definitely just a person\u2019s face. You\u2019d think Sean Hannity would be the expert on aggressive sexual deviancy, given that he spent most of his career working for disgraced sexual predator Roger Ailes and alongside disgraced (alleged) sexual predator Bill O\u2019Reilly.\n\nUnfortunately, this is what happens when you take news tips from 4chan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat would explain why Hannity pulled the article, as well as the tweet endorsing said article almost immediately after issuing it.

(I\u2019m speaking at the University of Alabama this evening), I stopped at a newsstand to get some orange juice and to consider buying one of those neck-pillow things for the flight. (I declined. These things are $17.99 in Pittsburgh, but here it was 37 whole American dollars. Fuck that. I ended up just making a pillow out of an unopened pack of boxer briefs I brought with me. Yup, I\u2019m a grown-ass man, and I just slept on some drawers.)\n\nWhile I was in line, a 20-something white woman in front of me kept glancing back and smirking. I thought perhaps she was a real-life Rose Armitage, so I turned my phone flash on just in case she tried any funny business. She finally spoke.\n\n\u201cExcuse me, has anyone ever told you you look just like Khalid?\u201d\n\nI lied: \u201cNo.\u201d And then I lied again: \u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe sings that song \u2018Location.\u2019 You know. \u2018Sendddddd me your location.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs tickled as I was that I was able to get this woman to sing and sway for me, my flight was boarding soon and I had to bounce.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve never heard it. Have a good day.\u201d\n\nAs I walked out of the store, I could hear her still singing the chorus of \u201cLocation\u201d softly to herself. And I was just glad I turned my flash on.\n\nIn the last two weeks, I\u2019ve been in Miami, Baltimore, D.C. (twice) and now Birmingham. Along with the airports in those cities, I\u2019ve had layovers in Charlotte, N.C., and Atlanta. And in that 14-day span, I\u2019ve had five separate nonblack people (three white women, a white man and an Asian man) mention that I look like Khalid\u2014an artist I had to Google a few months ago after another white woman in Pittsburgh said I looked like him. Yet when I\u2019ve shared this information with black people\u2014that white people keep telling me I look like him\u2014their responses range from \u201cWTF?\u201d to \u201cOf course. Because we all look alike to them.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy wife thinks (most) white people are just unable or unwilling to find any distinctions with black people\u2019s faces. That they just see the similarities with our hair, our beards and our complexions, but what we actually look like just doesn\u2019t register. This would explain the other person white people frequently tell me I remind them of: Donald Glover. Which is even more perplexing for what I assume are very, very, very, very, very obvious reasons. (Also, it\u2019s interesting that both Khalid and Donald Glover are considerably smaller men than I am, which makes me wonder if white people just automatically assign an exaggerated physical size to black men. Which, again, makes me glad my phone has a flash function.)\n\nAnyway, most of the black people I\u2019ve shared this story with also have stories about white people stopping them to tell them they look like people. Apparently this is the world\u2019s most annoying silent epidemic. But after an informal poll I conducted on Google Hangouts just now, none of these black people are walking up to random white people to tell them they look exactly like Steve Nash.\n\nSo basically, the moral of the story is that if you\u2019re a white person and you think some random black person looks like some other random black person, keep those thoughts to yourself. Because you\u2019re probably wrong. They\u2019ll probably be annoyed. And they\u2019ll probably be scanning for a teacup to smack out of your hands.", "keywords": ["random", "woman", "probably", "khalid", "look", "ive", "person", "white", "airports", "tell", "man", "black", "telling"], "polarity": -0.01694444444444445, "subjectivity": 0.4044642857142857},

We don\u2019t know how long he would have lived had he not been assassinated 50 years ago on Feb. 21, 1965, on the stage of the Audubon Ballroom at Broadway and West 165th Street in New York City. We just know that he was taken from us far too soon. Still, his intense, bespectacled gaze, forefinger resting against his face, remains the prevailing emblem of black rage and resistance. That his legacy has reverberated for decades without the stamp of approval from the U.S. government, without being taught in schools or quoted in Christian churches on Sunday mornings, speaks to the sheer magnitude of the man and the undeniable truth in his message.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMalcolm didn\u2019t tiptoe around diagnosing the illness of white supremacy or pointing out its symptoms in the form of religious terrorism and police brutality. He boldly declared that systemic racism is not baseless conjecture; rather, it is a deeply embedded statement of fact that provides the framework for the United States of America.\n\nMalcolm X loved black people and hated structural whiteness. Today, as dead black bodies continue to fall in U.S. streets from Ohio to New York, a booming prison-industrial complex continues to scour street corners for prey and a corrupt political system continues to placate black citizens with a blurry carbon copy of equality, his words in a 1964 letter to the Egyptian Gazette still ring true:\n\nWe can never get civil rights in America until our human rights are first restored. We will never be recognized as citizens there until we are first recognized as humans. \u2026 The American \u201csystem\u201d (political, economic and social) was produced from the enslavement of the black man, and this present \u201csystem\u201d is capable only of perpetuating that enslavement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is often said that revolution is for the young; this was true of Malcolm. Though he looms larger than life, he was 27 years old when he began preaching at Muhammad\u2019s Temple No. 7 in Harlem and only 39 years old when at least seven bullets left him gasping for his final breaths mere moments after greeting a crowd with \u201cAs-Salaam-Alaikum.\u201d\n\nPeace be unto you.\n\nAnd when he said peace, he also meant freedom because he taught us that there is no way to be at peace without it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn his riveting and iconic eulogy, activist and actor Ossie Davis declared Malcolm to be our \u201cshining black prince.\u201d What is less often quoted is that Davis also said that Harlem\u2019s black community\u2014\u201cbeleaguered, unfortunate, but nonetheless proud\u201d\u2014had never had a \u201cbraver, more gallant, young champion\u201d than Malcolm X. And it is that same bravery that propels a movement from city to city today.\n\nMany of us know the myth and the legend of Malcolm X. Here, The Root takes a look at the young man in action, putting on for his city and for his people, in these rarely seen clips.\n\n1. Malcolm X \u201cCity Desk\u201d interview, March 17, 1963:\n\nHere\u2019s Malcolm X on slavery stealing black identity as well as the enrollment of James Meredith into the University of Mississippi: \u201cIt\u2019s a farce; it\u2019s hypocrisy. Because if it\u2019s right for one Negro to be forced into that university then every Negro in the state of Mississippi who is qualified has the same right to go to that university. And if the government is not ready and willing to enforce the right of every Negro in the state of Mississippi, then it\u2019s only hypocrisy to pretend they are for justice by pushing one Negro in and blowing it up all over the world to make it look like they\u2019re solving the problem when millions of black people in that state are going to segregated schools and getting an inferior education.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Malcolm X during an undated ABC interview on the importance of being black:\n\n\u201cThe word \u2018Negro\u2019 is a term that was made up by the white man himself during slavery. No right-thinking black man in America will accept it as a term to apply to himself. If the white man, no matter how dark he gets, still regards himself as a white man, then our people, no matter how light we get, still regard ourselves as black people. If it\u2019s good enough for them to be white, then it\u2019s better for us to be black.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. Malcolm X speaks in Los Angeles on May 5, 1962, at the memorial service for Ronald Stokes, an NOI member killed by the Los Angeles Police Department:\n\n\u201c[Black people] should shock the white man by working together in unity. Despite religious, political, economic, or educational or social differences. Let us remember that we\u2019re not brutalized because we\u2019re Baptist. We\u2019re not brutalized because we\u2019re Methodist. We\u2019re not brutalized because we\u2019re Muslims. We\u2019re not brutalized because we\u2019re Catholic. We\u2019re brutalized because we\u2019re black people in America.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis speech is also when Malcolm asked the powerful, rhetorical question: \u201cWho taught you to hate yourself?\u201d\n\n4. Malcolm X debates civil rights leader and March on Washington architect Bayard Rustin on the need for self-determination for black America:\n\n\u201cToday the black man, according to the government economist, has spending power of $20 billion per year. We feel that with the black man spending $20 billion per year, not creating any businesses, not creating any industry, not creating any job opportunities for his own kind, he\u2019s not in a moral position to point the finger at the white man and say that he\u2019s discriminating against him for not giving him a job in factories that he himself set up. If the black man has $20 billion and these so-called Negroes are such geniuses that they can integrate white restaurants and white factories and force themselves into that which the white man has set up, they should use that same ingenuity to show the black people how to pool our wealth and set up something of our own.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn response to Rustin\u2019s criticism of the NOI for organizing in the streets of Harlem, Malcolm responded, \u201cYou can reach more people in the street who want to change than you can in the bourgeoisie society, the bourgeoisie church and the bourgeoisie circles.\u201d\n\n5. Malcolm X on voting:\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t suggest that they vote for any party or either party. I would suggest that the so-called Negroes become politically mature, realize the power that they hold in the field of politics. Once the person realizes that the Negro is awakened to the power that he holds, then that person will approach that Negro on a more intelligent plane. As it is right now, most of the Negro leaders sell out to the white politicians for crumbs, and a political awakening among Negroes will make it impossible for the present Negro leaders to sell our people out as they\u2019ve been doing in the past.\u201d", "keywords": ["political", "matters", "brutalized", "right", "icons", "negro", "city", "man", "white", "x", "ring", "words", "black", "malcolm", "true"], "polarity": 0.050913260237030716, "subjectivity": 0.42686022993400013},

A month prior to the general election for U.S. Senate in Alabama, I have been attacked by The Washington Post and other liberal media in a desperate attempt to smear my character and defeat my campaign. [1]\n\n1. First of all, the Washington Post isn\u2019t the one walking around every day dressed like they\u2019re auditioning to play Yosemite Sam in a live-action Bugs Bunny movie. Nor were they the ones allegedly trolling junior varsity football games, asking ninth-graders if they needed help with their social studies homework. I\u2019d say that had something to do with \u201csmearing your character\u201d... but, whatever dude.\n\nOver the last 40 years I have held several public offices, including Deputy District Attorney, Circuit Judge, and Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court. [2] In addition to running five statewide and three county campaigns for public office, I have been involved in two major controversies that attracted national attention, one about the Ten Commandments and the other the sanctity of marriage. The Alabama Judicial Inquiry Commission, Court of the Judiciary, and Attorney General have investigated, scrutinized, examined, and vetted me, not to mention every opposing candidate against whom I have run. [3]\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. You were elected in Alabama. To get elected in Alabama, all you have to do is say something about Jesus and have an \u201cR\u201d next to your name on the ballot. Alabama Republicans would elect a sock puppet to office if he showed up at the local Walmart and formed a prayer circle after handing out cans of Mountain Dew.\n\n3. Again, \u201cvetting\u201d in Alabama is different. You only have to answer three questions:\n\nAre you a U.S. citizen?\n\n\n\nDo you believe in our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ? (The blond one, though. Not that socialist Arab fella.)\n\n\n\nWar Eagle or Roll Tide?\n\n\n\nI have been married for almost 33 years to my wife Kayla. We have four children and five granddaughters. [4] We are in the process of investigating these false allegations to determine their origin and motivation. For instance, we have documented that the most recent accuser, Beverly Nelson, was a party in a divorce action before me in Etowah County Circuit Court in 1999. No motion was made for me to recuse. In her accusations, Nelson did not mention that I was the judge assigned to her divorce case in 1999, a matter that apparently caused her no distress at a time that was 18 years closer to the alleged assault. Yet 18 years later, while talking before the cameras about the supposed assault, she seemingly could not contain her emotions. [5]\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Translation: I\u2019m straight. And I be fucking. Also, let\u2019s not forget Kayla\u2019s yearbook photo is right next to one of the accusers\u2019.\n\n5. Dude, what the hell are you talking about? So your first line of defense against a woman who said you sexually assaulted her is: \u201cWell, why didn\u2019t she say something about that traumatic day in her life when I was a powerful judge, sitting in front of her exercising my authority over the dissolution of her marriage, in what was probably another one of the most traumatic experiences in her life\u201d? That\u2019s the excuse you\u2019re gonna go with? For real? I would have suggested, \u201cI am innocent. I didn\u2019t do this,\u201d but you\u2019re the legal expert here. So ... aight.\n\nMy signature on the order of dismissal in the divorce case was annotated with the letters \u201cD.A.,\u201d representing the initials of my court assistant. Curiously the supposed yearbook inscription is also followed by the same initials\u2014\u201cD.A.\u201d But at that time I was Deputy District Attorney, not district attorney. Those initials as well as the date under the signature block and the printed name of the restaurant are written in a style inconsistent with the rest of the yearbook inscription. The \u201c7\u2019s\u201d in \u201cChristmas 1977\u201d are in a noticeably different script than the \u201c7\u2019s\u201d in the date \u201c12-22-77.\u201d I believe tampering has occurred. [6]\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. \u201cThat\u2019s not my signature in her yearbook, so I didn\u2019t assault her.\u201d Again, this is your defense? I\u2019m worried about you, Roy. Not specifically you, per se. I\u2019m worried about all of the people whose cases you presided over. I\u2019m not a lawyer or anything, but you seem to be shitty at legal stuff, Roy. First, the Ten Commandment thing, then, you said, \u201cOur rights come \u201cfrom God,\u201d not the Constitution. Now this. It\u2019s almost like you learned the law in ... wait ... now I get it.\n\nAre we at a stage in American politics in which false allegations can overcome a public record of 40 years, stampede the media and politicians to condemn an innocent man, and potentially impact the outcome of an election of national importance? [7] When allegations of events occurring 40 years ago\u2014and never before mentioned during a 40-year career of public service\u2014are brought out and taken seriously only 30 days before a critical election, we may be in trouble as a country. [8]\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. Can false allegations overcome 40 years of public service? Where the hell have you been, Roy? Are you asking if lies like\u2014oh, let\u2019s say Benghazi, emails and Russian trolls\u2014can overcome a public record like ... oh, let\u2019s say a senator and secretary of state? I\u2019m gonna say \u201cyes\u201d to this one.\n\n8. I wholeheartedly agree. We are in trouble as a country.\n\nI adamantly deny the allegations of Leigh Corfman and Beverly Nelson, did not date underage girls, and have taken steps to begin a civil action for defamation. Because of that, at the direction of counsel, I cannot comment further. [9] Roy S. Moore [10]\n\n9.

It\u2019s a movie based on a story by Susan McMartin and the time she spent with her own real-life Mr. Church. It looked like a film where Eddie was playing a pantheon-level Magical Negro. I didn\u2019t see it back then and honestly forgot about its existence until Wednesday when I was perusing the Amazon Prime racks for something to watch.\n\nI saw Eddie Murphy\u2019s face on a movie and was like, \u201cHmm, I didn\u2019t realize he\u2019d released a movie so recently.\u201d I hit play and holy shit, bro, this is one of those movies where prospective Magical Negroes sit around and watch, take notes and then commiserate about how to up their Magical Negro-ness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike, right now, I could go outside, find me a white person, do the shit I saw in this movie, and I\u2019d bet a book would be written about how much of a better person I made them within six months. The lessons in Mr. Church have too much sauce. All shade aside, I actually enjoyed the movie; we all could use our own Mr. Church. Pretend that didn\u2019t sound slave-y.\n\nNot for nothing, but I\u2019d be really curious about the real Mr. Church\u2019s view of the movie and the story told of his life, though he passed on many years ago. Not that it\u2019s a bad one; it\u2019s just interesting. What makes Mr. Church a pantheon-level Magical Negro? A Magical Negro\u2019s Magical Negro? I\u2019m glad you asked. Here are 10 reasons:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. The entire premise of this movie is textbook Magical Negro-dom. A random black man shows up in the home of a white woman dying from breast cancer and her daughter to serve as their cook until the mother dies, projected to be in six months. I think the original title of the film was White Mom, Black Cook, but horny focus-group participants kept punching that into the search box on XVideos and it just got freaky.\n\nBack to the lecture at hand: Where does he come from? I haven\u2019t the foggiest. Some other person set the shit up. All we know is that he\u2019s there and the foods are going to get cooked come hell or high water. Also, he\u2019s been entreated with the responsibility of paying all of the bills from some mythical account for everything. Listen, while I\u2019d be leery if some random black man showed up to my house hovering over my not-quite-KitchenAid pots and pans, the minute he said, \u201cI got this, boo-boo\u201d as I looked at my Pepco bill, I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019d call him \u201cZaddy.\u201d\n\n2. When the mother lives an additional SIX YEARS, apparently, Mr. Magical Negro pays for all the bills out of his own pockets once that six-month fund runs low. How so? Well, in the FIRST place, he was offered a lifetime salary in exchange for cooking for six months, till the mother died. So, all that money he DID make when she lived? He poured right back into that household. Why for come? Because that\u2019s what a Magical Negro does; he fills a need where he sees one. Like reading to the mother nightly while she lay in bed searching for energy. Reading. Over and over. That\u2019s magic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. UPPING that ante, he goes to the supermarket one day and learns how much he saves by using coupons. Well, turns out he saves all of the savings over the course of the next, like, six or seven years, and when Charlie, the daughter, is all ready to go to college and gets into Boston University but can\u2019t afford it, there\u2019s Mr. Church right there with an envelope of all his coupon savings to cover her tuition. He gave her, like, $5,000. Do you know how much Hennessy he could have bought with $5,000? In 1977? But nope, he\u2019s here handing out magical envelopes. Of cash. To white teenagers. And cars.\n\n4. Here\u2019s part of his \u00fcber-magical nature: Charlie, the daughter who grows up and is who Mr. Church largely takes care of in life, hates reading books as a child. Especially books brought into her motherfucking establishment by some random black man who cooks delectable eats. Or, at least, she does at first. Over time, he introduces her to all the classics through his library system of having her check out books he brings over. She went from reading street signs to all of the classics. He gave her culture and depth. I salute you, Mr. Church.\n\n5. He always calls Charlie \u201cmy dear.\u201d It\u2019s reminiscent of The Princess Bride\u2019s Dread Pirate Roberts, aka Westley, and his constant refrain of \u201cas you wish\u201d to Princess Buttercup. Such a good movie. The Princess Bride, that is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. In true Magical Negro fashion, we never really learn much about Mr. Church\u2019s background until he dies. Turns out he was not only a great cook but also played the piano at a spot called Jelly\u2019s every weekend. In my mind, all Magical Negroes meet up at Jelly\u2019s on Sundays for brunch. His father was a horrible man and a mean cuss. But Mr. Church has always loved Charlie and her mother for giving him something he didn\u2019t have: a family. Which is Magical Negro parlance for, \u201cI\u2019ve never had one before.\u201d \u201cA room to yourself?\u201d \u201cA bed.\u201d [Half-smile.] Scene.\n\n7. Piggybacking on No. 6, Mr. Church has one rule: \u201cRespect his privacy.\u201d What does the white girl do? Charlie goes white girl and does not respect his privacy and digs and snoops through his shit and gets caught. And because Magical Negroes DO make mistakes on occasion\u2014he also often gets drunk when he\u2019s at Jelly\u2019s\u2014he puts her ass RIGHT out for snooping. But she\u2019s ALSO like hella pregnant and has nowhere to go, except to some store where some kid on a skateboard runs into her and her old friend from the neighborhood, Larson, happens to see her and gets her to the hospital, where Mr. Church magically shows up to claim her and bring her home.\n\n8. In what can only be described as a Magical Negro by Osmosis, it turns out that Larson was about to commit suicide with liquor and pills when Charlie got hit by the boy on a skateboard, and he had to help save her life, which, in turn, helped save his life. Mr. Church is out here saving white people by association.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. Charlie has her baby and then one of her former friends comes back into the picture and is now rich and snobby and Charlie wants to drop her as a friend. Mr. Church tells her not to get caught up in that shit. He\u2019s saving white relationships.\n\n10. Mr. Church ends up getting sick and dying and shit. Before he does that, though, he ends up teaching Charlie how to cook, play piano, garden, live, breathe, not die and ultimately be a good human. And he gave her the most important Magical Negro gift of all: She was able to write a story about him and became an author, thereby creating a job and livelihood by virtue of his very existence in her life.\n\nTo Mr. Church, a Magical Negro like no other.", "keywords": ["negrod", "reasons", "shit", "church", "magically", "does", "mr", "negro", "charlie", "mother", "white", "magical", "movie"], "polarity": 0.1633413283413283, "subjectivity": 0.5720266695266695},

Barnum of fashion who has turned his distinct point of view into a budding fashion empire, debuted his latest collaboration with Jimmy Choo Tuesday night. Abloh, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Kanye West\u2019s and a Grammy nominee for his work on Watch the Throne, was propelled to the forefront of fashion via association with the Kardashian family by grace of the king-making power of their social media influence\u2014influence that has also served designers like Olivier Rousteing of Balmain, who, like Abloh, is on the rise as one of the new rulers of fashion.\n\nWhat Abloh has is a keen understanding of consumer desire\u2014a yearning to be savvy enough to incorporate high-art motifs into closet staples like boots and T-shirts, along with a craving for street cred. His Off-White label provides both, producing $1,700 satin pussy-bow blouses with ties that dust the floor, and white plastic boots with the words \u201cFor Walking\u201d or \u201cOff-White\u201d in black safety-sign lettering up the side. Even the label\u2019s logo-decaled smartphone cases retail for a cool $95 and seem to be in the palms of private school kids from coast to coast.\n\nAlboh\u2019s style is entertaining and fun, but his offerings have that kind of art-world brevity about them where, even if the high-ticket items are a joke on the buyer, it\u2019s better to be in on the joke than not to get it at all. It\u2019s exactly this kind of savvy marketing that has won the designer collaborations with brands as diverse as Ikea and famed artists like Takashi Murakami, while Off-White is a favorite among top models, luxury-fashion editors, the hip-hop crowd and those who want to feel hip by association.\n\n\n\nJimmy Choo via You Tube\n\nAbloh\u2019s newest collaborative collection, Off-White \u2105 Jimmy Choo, brings together all the elements of his fascinations: art, fashion, and \u201980s and \u201990s iconic cool. On its website, Jimmy Choo posted that the collection was inspired by the late Princess Diana, an interesting muse, given that we are all waiting with bated breath to see how Meghan Markle will leave her stamp on royal style.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s also a deft move on Abloh\u2019s part; last November he was the first black designer to receive a British Fashion Council Award for Urban Luxe Brand. Princess Di and urban streetwear could not be farther part\u2014although the princess was known to put on a leotard and tights for roller-skating around the halls of Buckingham Palace.\n\nWhy this move toward regal attire and ladylike fare is so cunning on Abloh\u2019s part is that, in true P.T. Barnum style, it\u2019s a three-ring-circus. Just when you thought it was just sneakers and cellphone covers, here comes something entirely new to capture your imagination.\n\nSandra Choi, Kendall Jenner and Virgil Abloh (Jimmy Choo via Instagram) Kendall Jenner and Gigi Hadid (Jimmy Choo via Instagram) 1 / 2\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe party to fete his Spring/Summer 2018 ready-to-wear collection and Off-White \u2105 Jimmy Choo, both of which will be in stores this week, drew an A-list crowd of models like Bella and Gigi Hadid, Kaia Gerber, Kendall Jenner and Naomi Campbell, decked out in the Princess Di-inspired collection along with the shoes. The clothes were sophisticated and subdued for the most part\u2014garden party chintz, sharply cut suits with walking shorts and cropped jackets with lapels that jutted forward like the bow of the royal yacht\u2014while stilettos were covered in clear PVC cocoons or ruched with tulle. Tulle, that most feminine and genteel of fabrics, was also applied to thigh-high boots, casting a kind of fairy-tale softness to the look.\n\nOf the unlikely brand matchup, Abloh told Women\u2019s Wear Daily:\n\nIt was an idea I had. I\u2019d met Sandra [Choi] at the Bowery hotel, and I always had this idea within my collection to sort of get more specific and story-tell ... I was working on this collection that was a tribute to Princess Diana and [Jimmy Choo] were a shoemaker that were making shoes for her. And I thought it could have been a cool way to relate the product and the narrative of Princess Diana to a younger audience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI think that no matter what Abloh does, he\u2019s got a firm creative hold on the zeitgeist and will surely remain part of the greatest show on earth.", "keywords": ["collection", "collaboration", "choo", "fashion", "covet", "jimmy", "abloh", "jenner", "princess", "kendall", "bnyfw", "kind", "offwhite"], "polarity": 0.23849431818181818, "subjectivity": 0.49405513468013457},

Artist Kehinde Wiley portrays the former president as concerned, probing, and calm, with just the faintest hint of a smirk playing across his lips; he is settled within a radiant, repeating wall of foliage, faintly obscured where his shoes nestle into the overgrowth. As presidential portraits go, it\u2019s bold, opinionated, and utterly modern. Alongside Amy Sherald\u2019s painting of Michelle Obama, it also happens to be the first commission to a black artist from the National Portrait Gallery.\n\n\n\nAccordingly, Sean Hannity does not like it. In point of fact, he thinks there is \u201csecret sperm\u201d on the painting, and it frightens him. This is not a euphemism; he thinks that Wiley painted jizz onto Obama\u2019s face. In a since-deleted post entitled \u201cPORTRAIT PERVERSION\u201d published today on his blog, an author mysteriously dubbed \u201cHannity Staff\u201d writes:\n\nControversy surrounding Kehinde Wiley\u2019s wildly non-traditional portrait of the Commander-in-Chief broke out within minutes of its unveiling; with industry insiders claiming the artist secretly inserted his trademark technique -concealing images of sperm within his paintings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you\u2019re hoping for more explanation than that, you will not find it in the article, which is still available to read via cache. It moves on from there to note that the artist once sardonically used the phrase \u201ckill whitey\u201d in a New York magazine profile, which at least has the virtue of being true, unlike the claim that he put sperm in his painting of Barack Obama, which is objectively not true.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look, just to be sure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYep, definitely just a person\u2019s face. You\u2019d think Sean Hannity would be the expert on aggressive sexual deviancy, given that he spent most of his career working for disgraced sexual predator Roger Ailes and alongside disgraced (alleged) sexual predator Bill O\u2019Reilly.\n\nUnfortunately, this is what happens when you take news tips from 4chan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat would explain why Hannity pulled the article, as well as the tweet endorsing said article almost immediately after issuing it.

And, unfortunately, relentless, since reason and fact and the supporters\u2019 own, actual, deaths just don\u2019t seem to matter, either.\n\nBut can we take a moment to step back and acknowledge how gotdamn fucking weird it is, too? Deciding, as a response to Keurig\u2019s decision to stop airing ads on Hannity\u2019s Fox News show\u2014a decision the company eventually rescinded, but whatever\u2014to go into your kitchen and smash your coffee maker to smithereens and then post it to the internet is a weird-ass thing to do!\n\nThe only reasons I can think of to destroy an expensive coffee-making apparatus in your own home are:\n\n1. if it was being used, by an ambitious and resourceful killer, to bludgeon you to death, and you needed to break it to save your own life; or, perhaps,\n\n2. if it grew sentient and decided to stop making coffee and just spent the entire day on your couch watching Vice Principal reruns on HBO On Demand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen, and only then, would I think, \u201cYou know what? This Keurig 2.0 K575 Plus Brewing System maybe needs to die.\u201d But even then, I wouldn\u2019t put its death on the internet, because no one would believe my story about the sentient, Walton Goggins-obsessed coffee maker that needed to be executed. If I did do it, people would see that and think, \u201cSomething is wrong with Damon, I think,\u201d and they\u2019d start a group-text thread about what might be troubling me. Perhaps I\u2019d even get an Edible Arrangement in the mail this week with a card saying, \u201cJust thinking about you, bro. Hang in there.\u201d And I hate coffee!\n\nBut white people do shit like this all of the damn time, and no one really steps back to comment on how fucking weird it is because I guess we just associate extra-super-duper whiteness with weirdness. Like the time, for instance, when white people went ballistic on french fries\u2014french fries!\u2014because France decided that the Iraq War was a shitty idea. They even started calling them \u201cfreedom fries\u201d\u2014Freedom. Fries.\u2014which, again, is weird as fuck! What the hell did a french fry ever do to them, besides be delicious and surprisingly good with Dijon mustard?\n\nThere\u2019s also the practice of burning the jerseys of professional athletes who decide to switch teams. We all recognize the unambiguous racial subtext of these white fans performing this act when disappointed by black players, but what about the abject weirdness of going into your closet and grabbing a Kevin Durant jersey and then going to your deck and grabbing some lighter fluid, and then going to your backyard to set it on fire and posting your Durant bonfire on the internet?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you are my friend and I call you up and say, \u201cHey, friend, what\u2019s going on?\u201d and you say, \u201cI\u2019m in my backyard filming the tiny flames emitting from the remnants of that $450 LeBron jersey I bought three years ago. Do you want to come through?\u201d I am going to refuse your request to come over, and I am going to call you an ambulance just in case you\u2019re having a stroke.\n\nWhite people are so weird that there\u2019s an entire subgenre of black-people discourse called \u201cwhite-people shit\u201d where we discuss, among ourselves, weird-ass shit that white people do. It\u2019s pretty much both a support group and a perpetual verifier, because some of this shit is so weird that we believe no one would believe us unless other people witnessed and/or experienced it, too.\n\nIt even affects how we consume the news. We immediately place weird-ass things that happen into the \u201cwhite-people shit\u201d subcategory without knowing anything about those things other than the headline. Y\u2019all are so weird\u2014and so known for this weirdness\u2014that we racially profile the news.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI guess I should be happy, at least, that it was Keurig that decided to pull its advertisements and not Sesame Street.

I\u2019m one of those semi-road-warrior types who collects miles and points on my weekly trips in and around the United States to sit in meetings where I add marginal value, eat boxed lunches and internally critique PowerPoint font choices. I\u2019m TSA Precheck. I have airline status. I judge people\u2019s attire based on the ease with which they can pass through the security screening.\n\nLong story short, I spend a lot of time in airports. Honestly, I think airports are one of the truly fascinating places to people-watch because of the overall temporary nature of just about everyone there. Someone\u2019s leaving town, someone else is heading out on vacation. Another person just closed a deal, while the person beside them is hoping that they\u2019re gonna get that job. Interspersed in all of this are the people going to meet their grandkids for the first time and an occasional \u201cThis is my first time flying\u201d person.\n\nBut there we all are, together at the airport, traveling hither and yon, connected by a few minutes at the bar sipping our preferred form of preflight courage while checking smartphones and flight statuses and taking in the ever-ubiquitous presence of CNN on the airport TV screens.\n\nFor the most part, the conversations are benign:\n\n\u201cWhere ya headed?\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s home?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhaddya do?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow long ya going for?\u201d\n\n\n\nUsually it\u2019s brief, a chat with a few laughs, some minor discoveries about each other, and then someone hops off their stool, downs the rest of the IPA and hightails it off to the gate to make their flight to Phoenix or Tulsa, Okla., or Newark, N.J.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut as with any situation that involves booze, loose associations, acceptable generalizations, a somewhat diverse crowd and a TV screen showing a constant stream of CNN, sometimes the conversations can get a little contentious.\n\nA little while ago, I found myself in my usual spot at an airport bar after a long day of corporate tap dancing and professional mask-wearing, nursing a glass of Templeton Rye on the rocks and working my way through my usual grilled cheese sandwich with tomatoes, when I overheard two rather loud and somewhat intoxicated late-middle-aged white men accosting the TV screen and yammering on about that specific topic of the news and how that was specifically the thing that was destroying this country.\n\n\n\nI couldn\u2019t get the initial gist of their complaints, since I was kinda in my own world at the moment, but as I grasped what was on CNN and used context clues to put two and two together (shoutout to Ms. Pugh-Scott\u2019s second-grade class, y\u2019all), I realized that these men had been whipped into a frothy tirade over immigration. Namely, the fact that \u201ceveryone\u201d seemed so afraid to call these countries where all these immigrants and \u201cillegals\u201d (their words, not mine) came from the veritable \u201cshitholes\u201d that they are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSee, we used to call it the \u2018Third World,\u2019 and it was, you know, countries that might\u2019ve been poor or not as sophisticated as us, and so we wanted to reach out to them, maybe train some doctors from there, teach some of their folks how we do business here, and then they were supposed to go back home to build their own damn countries!\u201d\n\n\u201cYep. These people keep staying here because they know they don\u2019t want to go back to those Third World countries. But instead of going home and helping their own people, they wanna use chain migration and bring their brothers and sisters and all their kids, and eventually we got the whole damn village to support with OUR tax dollars. It\u2019s bullshit, if you ask me.\u201d\n\nAt that moment, I knew I should have just minded my own business, but the way my woke is set up, I couldn\u2019t let it pass without saying something. See, I come from an immigrant family myself, and as a Liberian, I know the Trump administration rescinded temporary protected status for many of my family and countrymen last May. My wife is an immigrant, as are her parents, and so our children are the only members of our family born in America. I work at a company full of immigrants. Hell, I had the self-awareness to see that the bartenders at the airport and the people running the food were also immigrants.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut here we were, with me now forced to speak up in the face of willful ignorance and Fox News talking points with facts, logic and reason that these men were too old, too drunk and too white to accept. The irony notwithstanding that, in their defense of their own bigotry and self-serving view of Americanness, they shamelessly referenced the corpses of their own immigrant ancestors as if they had arrived on these shores welcomed with open arms and personally ready to start the tech companies and hedge funds of their day.\n\n\n\nAs the conversation teetered dangerously close to me having to call them the nativist racists that they were, and as the bar staff was becoming visually uncomfortable with their characterizations of \u201cthose Latinos,\u201d God intervened with an announcement that the flight to Dallas (or Houston, or Little Rock, Ark., or just generically Dixieland) was boarding and they ambled off their stools, shook my hand, and we wished each other safe travels. I mean, fuck those guys, but I\u2019m pretty sure everyone on their flight wasn\u2019t racist, and I wouldn\u2019t want them to suffer the karmic repercussions of the dumbass opinions of those two assholes.\n\nBut somehow, it got worse.\n\nAfter those men left, a youngish white couple, male and female, dressed in their vacation clothes, who had been sitting there all along, decided to chime in. But to, like, thank me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOh, my God. We heard what was going on over there, and it\u2019s just so refreshing to see someone actually, like, you know, speak up against those kinds of people.\u201d\n\nYeah, I mean, thanks, I guess, but that actually pissed me off even more: the fact that I, as the aggrieved party, had to speak up for myself and by extension those similarly situated around me (who were in no position to say anything), while Tad and Becca sat on the sidelines and offered only silence as support. I\u2019m sure that in their minds and in the story they\u2019d tell about the incident, they were on the right side of the argument and would pat themselves on the back for not sharing the opinions of the other two men at that bar.\n\nWhite people who want to be \u201callies\u201d need to understand that their agreement isn\u2019t enough. It\u2019s not enough for you to nod while I defend myself, or to bristle when something offensive is said or done to a member of a minority or marginalized community. Nah. There\u2019s just not enough of us to fight this battle alone, and if white people want to prove their worth in the struggle, they\u2019re going to need to speak the fuck up at the exact moment of the offense.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOtherwise, it\u2019s just a different form of complicity. It\u2019s the decision to choose your own comfort over the discomfort of others. It\u2019s the purest form of privilege, and it needs to be treated with the same derision as abject and active racism. Otherwise, you\u2019re not an ally; you\u2019re just another enemy. You gotta pick a side and then you gotta actually work. Complicity is more dangerous than any outwardly racist act.\n\n\n\nOn the bright side, they did pay for my Templeton Rye on the rocks and my grilled cheese sandwich, so I guess they weren\u2019t all bad.", "keywords": ["allies", "going", "im", "speak", "dont", "enemies", "know", "white", "men", "airport", "need", "work", "flight", "world"], "polarity": 0.05962957875457874, "subjectivity": 0.4479105616605617},

Hunte\u2019s collection does not depend on hype; rather, it depends on finely worked jackets with well-thought-out detailing like detachable sleeves, reversible linings and detachable collars in combinations that are at once surprising and surprisingly wearable.\n\nFor his 2018 Fall/Winter collection, the designer said that his inspiration was Aspen, Colo., a city that is cloaked in posh ski resorts, five-star restaurants, world-class think tanks and luxury shopping that\u2019s as intense as any black diamond ski run. It\u2019s also a city where your coat conveys status as much as, if not more than, your clothes; those wet suits Hunte used as underpinnings may have been a nod also to the one-piece ski suits so ubiquitous in the Mile-High City.\n\nHunter has a unique vocabulary when it comes to coats that draws equally from cinched, belted and chained Italian police uniforms; Marcy Projects street style; and the glamour of old Hollywood movies. Hunte\u2019s women make grand entrances and dramatic exits; one particular standout this season was a trench coat with fox-fur patchwork.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut what Hunte does best is updating and reworking his own signature details and patterns. He is known for dressing celebs like Beyonc\u00e9, Halle Berry and Zendaya in buffalo-check ponchos; this season, clear PVC was added as an overlay on the checked pattern to give this soft staple fabric both edge and a modern dimension. (You\u2019ll likely be seeing a lot of PVC this season; it was also utilized by Virgil Abloh in his capsule collection for Jimmy Choo that debuted at New York Fashion Week on Tuesday.)\n\nWhat we saw this season was a modern woman\u2019s uniform for traveling exploring.

You know who I\u2019m talking about. The ecru-colored citizens who turn beet red at facts and statistics, who wondered why they weren\u2019t included in the phrase #BlackLivesMatter and who called it a \u201cterrorist organization.\u201d The taupe Americans who cried butt-hurt boo-hoos when football players did exactly what they suggested and knelt in silent protest during the anthem. The group of nonthinking matte eggshells who once labeled Martin Luther King Jr. and Colin Kaepernick \u201ccommunists.\u201d\n\nWhite people.\n\nNow they are mad at coffee machines.\n\nNo, seriously ... they are. In support of an allegedly verified pedophile (because if pedophilia were like Twitter, Roy Moore would have a blue checkmark), Caucasians have mounted a campaign of destroying their own property as a protest. I know it doesn\u2019t make any sense, so I will explain it to you.\n\nLate last week, the Washington Post published a story about Roy Moore\u2019s alleged preference for ninth-graders. The report included four women who have never met one another and yet all tell similar stories about the Alabama Republican running in a special election for a Senate seat.\n\nMoore reportedly likes his women like he likes his coffee: fresh, hot and not yet capable of solving binomial equations. The story was immaculately reported with 30 corroborating sources. But you know how the Washington Post can be sometimes\u2014always bringing up factual old stuff.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince the story was first reported, a fifth accuser has emerged with a story that mirrors those of the first four, including a yearbook signed by Moore. What 30-year-old does that? Until this story came out, I had legitimately forgotten that was a thing. One of Moore\u2019s former co-workers even came out to say that Moore was known to troll malls and high school football games for teens.\n\nIn response to the charges, the technological marvel whose head was somehow replaced with a Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade float, Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity, invited Moore to defend himself Friday night. Moore did such a poor job of explaining his alleged preference for women who read Judy Blume novels that Hannity was forced to offer an assist, repeatedly mansplaining Moore\u2019s reported encounter with a 14-year-old by saying, \u201cNo other sexual conduct had taken place. No sexual intercourse.\u201d Hannity later added that the allegations by the 16-year-old \u201cinvolve kissing and only kissing.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter Hannity allowed an accused child molester to grace his airwaves and equivocate about sexual molestation, people began pressuring advertisers to pull ads from Hannity\u2019s show. Coffee maker-maker (I\u2019ve always wanted to use that in a sentence) Keurig was one of the first companies to remove its advertising from the show, along with Realtor.com, 23andMe and Nature\u2019s Bounty.\n\nYou can\u2019t smash a website or a DNA company. So white people took their frustration out on the closest thing available\u2014their Keurig coffee machines. Soon after Keurig pulled its ads, the hashtag #BoycottKeurig went viral on white Twitter, and people began posting pictures and videos of themselves smashing their coffee machines.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs one of the few adult humans who don\u2019t share an affinity for the triple-filtered mud-cake beverage called coffee, I am not shocked by this caucasity. These are the same people who hire dominatrixes to put their testicles in vices and believe that driving their Jeeps through the mud on the weekend is a sport. I\u2019ve seen Jackass. I know how this works.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing about this: It actually worked! Keurig apologized.\n\nIn an internal statement to employees, the company said that it had only planned to \u201cpause\u201d its advertising on the show, but that it was a mistake because it made the company look like it was \u201ctaking sides.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTaking sides? Sides? There\u2019s another side to excusing pedophilia? There\u2019s an actual flip side to giving voice to an alleged child molester? (You should know that I say \u201calleged\u201d for legal reasons, but my heart says \u201cbaby rapist.\u201d)\n\nEither white privilege is the most powerful trump card in the world or we\u2019ve been doing it wrong all these years. Instead of marching across the Edmund Pettus Bridge, maybe we should have just smashed voting booths to smithereens. Maybe Rosa Parks should have busted the windows out of that Montgomery, Ala., bus. Perhaps that\u2019s why Black Lives Matter is so frowned upon\u2014it hasn\u2019t \u201cboycotted\u201d police by throwing them over a balcony.\n\nOh, white people, you amuse me so.

My wife and I drove to Washington, D.C., after biking from Pittsburgh to Cumberland, Md., on a four-day and 150-mile trek that I still plan to write about eventually, but remain too traumatized by to write about yet.\n\nWe arrived Saturday evening, went out and stayed the night with the friends we made the bike trip with, and had all of Sunday in D.C. before flying back to Pittsburgh Monday morning. We decided to try to visit \u201cthe Blacksonian\u201d since neither of us had been.\n\nBut, as we quickly learned, if you\u2019re not on any waiting lists (and we weren\u2019t), the only way to get same-day tickets is to get up at the butt crack of dawn and check online (which we didn\u2019t do). Plus, it was the Sunday before Labor Day, which meant the National Mall would be even busier than usual, and any chance of scoring walk-up tickets would be scarce.\n\nRunning out of options, I made a Facebook status about our predicament and asked if anyway knew of any other way. Luckily, one of my friends messaged me that veterans can get into Smithsonian museums whenever they want, and since her dad is a vet, he\u2019d meet us there and get us in.\n\nI connected with her dad and agreed to meet him in front of the museum at 3 p.m. When I asked how we\u2019d know it was him, he replied in a typical 75-year-old black-man way: \u201cYou won\u2019t miss me. I\u2019ll be the handsomest man there.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, he was right. We saw him near the entrance where we agreed to meet. Decked out in an exquisitely tailored charcoal-gray suit, black-and-gray oxfords and a burgundy bowtie, he immediately reminded me of Ossie Davis.\n\nWe introduced ourselves, shook his hand and thanked him, and he replied, \u201cNot a problem. It\u2019s my pleasure.\u201d\n\nWe spoke for a couple more minutes, and we learned that he\u2019d just left church and post-church brunch with his family\u2014which is probably why he was so extra-super sharp\u2014and that he fulfills this request for people frequently. When we apologized for interrupting his day, he corrected us: \u201cNo. I consider this a duty.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen you enter the Blacksonian, the guides suggest that you start at the basement (which is where the time spanning the trans-Atlantic slave trade is documented and displayed) and work your way back up to the top floor. The museum was packed, so we had to wait in line to get on an elevator that would take us down there. There were a few dozen people in front of us, but the line moved swiftly and efficiently, and we were on the elevator within 10 minutes.\n\nThe basement was everything you\u2019d expect an entire floor devoted to the hundreds of years that black people were in bondage in America would be. It was fucking heavy. And hard. And scary. And sad. Even now, six months after I was on that floor, the thought of it heats and wells my eyes. Some people were crying. Others just staring, silent and blank and sad and seething, at the exhibits. Some of those who brought young children were attempting to educate them while also visibly fighting the urge not to be overcome by emotion. And everyone was respectful of the weight and the temperature of that room.\n\n\n\nWell, mostly everyone.\n\nThe crowd was maybe 70 percent percent black. And those who didn\u2019t happen to be black appeared to be just as moved by what was being experienced. But there was one 40-something white man there who, on at least three separate occasions, bumped into other museumgoers while he was attempting to take pictures and text.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey weren\u2019t egregious or violent bumps; he didn\u2019t knock anyone off balance. But they were the type of bumps where you\u2019d look up after being bumped because you\u2019d expect that person to stop what he was doing and apologize. Which is exactly what each person did after being bumped.\n\nNo apology came, however, as this guy was too transfixed with his phone to even notice. In a different environment, this type of social faux pas around black people would have induced at least a couple of \u201cUm. Excuse you\u201ds. Instead, he was just met by head shakes and looks of disgust. They weren\u2019t going to let him ruin their experience.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, I joined my friend Deesha Philyaw onstage at the Summit Against Racism for a talk titled, \u201cHow Not to Be a Racist Shithead.\u201d For 45 minutes, we addressed the predominantly white audience of 300, and basically just spent our time finding different ways to say, \u201cWhite people, you need to do better.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToward the end of our talk, I brought up the idea that white people need to learn how to be guests. If you are in someone else\u2019s house and they ask you to take off your shoes before stepping onto their floor, you take off your shoes. And if you are the type of person who usually wears shoes without socks, do your research and put some fucking socks on before you leave your house.\n\nIt\u2019s a concept many white people seem to struggle with. That not all things are theirs. And that some things will never have owners because they cannot be owned. And some things belong to other people. And whether those things are dialects or music or histories or actual bodies, that a proper reverence for them must be possessed before engaging with them.\n\nWhen thinking about this, I can\u2019t help thinking about that day at the Blacksonian. And all of the things we had to do that day just to get tickets. And that beautiful man helping us out, as he\u2019s helped others, because he knows how important it is for that space to be witnessed and experienced. And the rows of (mostly black) people, waiting patiently and anxiously to be taken to a floor displaying the horrors our ancestors were forced through. And the faces of the people engaging with those exhibits. The sadness and the anger and the shock.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then this white guy, either oblivious to or just not giving a shit about his surroundings, bumping into people.

I was a 14-year-old freshman at Loyola High School, a prestigious Jesuit all-boys school in Los Angeles built on the philosophy that rigorous academic training would produce the next generation of elite Catholic young men.\n\n\n\nKnown for its meat grinder academics, Loyola also had a complementary mission to train young men to have a social justice mindset, a \u201cMan for Others.\u201d We were to go out and change the world. Seems like a school perfectly matched to the philosophy of Martin Luther King Jr., right?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, not at first.\n\nFor most of the school\u2019s life, the world that Loyola wanted to change was white, just like its student body and faculty. Around the mid-1970s, by the time the school opened its doors to more black and brown boys from throughout South Central and East L.A., it had recognized that African American and Latino communities needed to be served also. But still, when I entered Loyola, the school was around 90 percent white, both in students and faculty.\n\nFrom the point of view of the small group of black Loyola boys, we were invisible. Admitted for our academic chops, yes, but who also just happened to be damn fast on the football field and track, we were ignored in all things social. We had to fight for recognition of our clubs, to host dances with black Catholic girls\u2019 schools and to gain the rights any other student would have.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was the downside. The upside? We also knew that by attending Loyola, we were the direct beneficiaries of the Martin Luther King Jr. dream. As such, we wanted Loyola to recognize King\u2019s birthday, which had yet to be declared a federal holiday, as a school holiday.\n\nLoyola said no.\n\nSo we black boys did what we were supposed to do. We revolted.\n\nMost of our families migrated to Los Angeles in the 1950s and 1960s to escape the darkness of the Jim Crow South in order to bask in the golden-sunshine promise of western freedom. Now able to see the mountaintop, black families in Southern California took full advantage. Affirmative action opened previously closed doors in education and employment, turning sharecroppers who\u2019d pulled cotton in the dry, hot fields of Texas into shareholders of Texas Instruments. And they destroyed the racist housing covenants that kept blacks out of the previously white South Central neighborhoods like Inglewood, Baldwin Hills, Ladera Heights, Windsor Hills and View Park. Having their sons admitted to the top academic school like Loyola was a cherry on top.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe were living King\u2019s dream.\n\nThis didn\u2019t mean that every black Loyola boy was a natural ally. Most of us had grown up playing in Little League against one another, but there were definite class differences. Flatlanders, aka the boys who lived in South Central and Inglewood, versus the Hill Negroes, the ones with the Baldwin Hills views of downtown Los Angeles\u2014these were a definite class dividing line. It was Jack and Jill versus Jamal and Jamila. Those who took the Rapid Transit District bus, aka the Rough Tough and Dangerous, through Blood and Crip territory versus those who rode comfortably in their dad\u2019s classic Jag to the Dons.\n\nYet when it came to standing up for our own dignity, and the dignity of King, those black class barriers broke down and we stood arm in arm and marched in lockstep. We\u2019d fight together not only to get a King holiday but also to change the school itself. Not just for us, but also for future black Loyola boys.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTaught by the Jesuits that our brains were our most powerful weapon, and the reason we\u2019d been admitted to the school in the first place, we pressured the Jesuits to listen to our arguments. We transformed our lunch from pickup basketball games to teach-ins around the philosophies of Frantz Fanon, Angela Davis, Dick Gregory and Malcolm X. We grew our facial hair, in direct violation of the strict Loyola dress code, as an act of nonviolent protest. This would get us JUG, or Justice Under God, as detention was known at the school, but still, the Jesuits didn\u2019t move.\n\nFinally, we decided to do something drastic. Instead of simply being absent on the day, the black students would show up on King\u2019s birthday wearing a white shirt, black pants and a simple black-tie uniform. The key? Stay silent in class when called upon by teachers as an act of nonviolent resistance. Today this may seem like a relatively benign act of defiance, since it didn\u2019t involve tearing something up or burning something down, but as a 14-year-old black boy still trying to understand that he held all the power in the universe to make change, it was amazing.\n\nLoyola is the oldest school in Southern California, with the traditions and stately brick buildings that come with that legacy. Intrinsic within Loyola was the notion that you as a student were extremely privileged to attend such an august institution, and as such, students needed to toe the line, or that opportunity could be taken away from you. In other words, when the Jesuits asked you to jump, you only asked how high after you were already in the air.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo when the teacher pointed to you and said, \u201cMr. Ross \u2026 ,\u201d you answered immediately. We didn\u2019t.\n\nI didn\u2019t.\n\nOn that day on Jan. 15, 1981, the majority of the black students at Loyola (there are a few who didn\u2019t, and to this day, I can remember their names) sat in their seats and said nothing when called upon. It was an act of defiance that was unmistakable and, frankly, jarring to the Jesuits. And yet, understanding King\u2019s philosophy that said nonviolent change was revolutionary, we risked our spots at Loyola to create our own small revolution.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter school, phone calls were made to our nervous parents, the ones who\u2019d risked so much to get us into that \u201cLie-Oh-La,\u201d and yet they didn\u2019t blink, either.\n\nWe didn\u2019t win that year. But we kept up the protests, the rhetoric, and finally the Jesuits broke. Loyola honored Martin Luther King Jr. as a school holiday in 1982, a year before President Ronald Reagan signed the federal holiday into law.\n\nThat was then, 36 years ago, when King\u2019s life and philosophy felt real and alive. Now we\u2019re approaching the 50th anniversary of his death, and King has been transformed into a stone figure, towering over the African-American community, but rarely understood correctly. For my Gen X compadres, many of us moved on from King, who in some ways became pass\u00e9 in comparison with the dynamic Malcolm X, and the burgeoning hip-hop culture that embodied his \u201cBy any means necessary\u201d philosophy.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe were living in a world where the crack was flowing, the bullets flying and the government lying, all to wage war on black and brown bodies in Baltimore, Chicago, Washington, D.C., New Orleans and, yes, South Central. Nonviolence? Not a goddamn chance. But for many white folks, and some black folks, the diminished legacy of King presented an opportunity.\n\nGiven a choice between the angry red pill of Malcolm X\u2019s \u201cBallot or the Bullet\u201d and the blue chill pill of King\u2019s nonviolence, white folks began swallowing handfuls of blue pills that created a gentrified MLK of \u201cWhat would King do?\u201d questions, and \u201ccolorblind society\u201d empty platitudes. In other words, white folks turned Martin Luther King Jr. into a Jedi mind trick of nothingness, stripping him of meaning, and turning his words and movement into a clich\u00e9.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t as if they were alone. What was more genius was that they got some black folks to believe that \u201cnothingness\u201d definition of King. While we weren\u2019t looking, someone had injected a post-racial tumor into the brains of some black folks who turned a King movement dedicated to the \u201cus\u201d into a hollow narcissistic philosophy devoted to the \u201cme.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese Negropeans, instead of feeling the responsibility of fighting the King fight to create a hand-up for those needing a come up, rejected the tangible connective tissue that binds us together as black people. In other words, they\u2019d sing Stevie Wonder\u2019s \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d tribute as an ode to authentic blackness, heads swaying and all, without giving one nanosecond of understanding of the philosophy of the man for whom the song was written.\n\nI see it in social media spaces like Nextdoor and Facebook groups, especially those centered in the black Los Angeles areas of Inglewood, Baldwin Hills, Ladera, View Park and Windsor Hills, the same places where my fellow Loyola classmates and I lived and fought to keep King\u2019s dream alive. They\u2019re now filled with the nouveau Negro riche who are more concerned with their paper property values than with the plight of the black poor for whom King marched. They spend their time aggrieved that the black poor inconveniently live within shouting distance of their emerald green lawns and mighty-whitey picket fences.\n\nWith their remote cameras, their transformation of crime into a fetish, and the almost pathological need to distinguish themselves from the poor, undereducated black other who have the temerity to walk down their sidewalks, it should come as no surprise that as these black middle-class communities became more and more gentrified by the privileged children of white flight, these beneficiaries of King enthusiastically joined these new interlopers in myopically misquoting King\u2019s \u201ccolorblind society\u201d as a justification for not noticing that African-American communities are being dissolved in irrevocable ways, all because yet another zero has been added to the worth of their house and a Whole Foods is rumored to be a-comin\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs that how much King\u2019s dream is worth today?\n\nIn some ways, this is a natural progression as the struggle for social justice moves from consciousness to unconsciousness as the generations move away from the real King as a flesh-and-blood human rights revolutionary. Fifty years after his dead body was reduced to a Newsweek shock post, King has become a myth or a symbol. Nothing says your philosophy has become impotent more than when black folks think they can create social change through those symbols, but without the hard work. Most important, King as symbol has stripped away the empathy that comes with believing that the destinies of black people, whether rich or poor, are always and forever connected.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChanging one\u2019s profile picture to say Black Lives Matter one day, only to counteract it the next day by parroting the white supremacist notion that blackness is an inherent moral deficit that causes \u201cblack-on-black crime,\u201d is a paradox that can\u2019t be aligned. However, it is what happens when you get the good education, the good job, and think that you made it because of your individual genius and pluck, but also because you think your property taxes are the true metric of your moral worth. A wealth that you believe gives you carte blanche to look down on the black working poor who rent, shower at night because of their dirty jobs and, yeah, like to talk shit on street corners with a tall can, seeing them as your lessers.\n\n\u201cRaise your game up!\u201d is the pithy philosophy of some beneficiaries of King\u2019s largesse. It\u2019s what they shout to the black poor for whom King actually fought. King died supporting the Memphis garbage workers as they went on strike for a decent wage back in 1968, but if they did that today in a black middle-class neighborhood, we\u2019d have some black folks ask in social media why they had to see these dirty men walking on their sidewalks, and why couldn\u2019t they protest somewhere else?\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need any ghetto black kids being bused into our neighborhoods\u201d is what they do say today when King\u2019s mission of erasing structural educational inequity means that their Capri Sun-sipping black children would sit side by side with a black kid from the projects.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn other words, King\u2019s dream\u2014the one that spoke of centering the inequities of black America, particularly around educational access and poverty, into America\u2019s consciousness\u2014had turned into a RushCard nightmare of petty capitalism and the struggle to be seen as upper black middle class through the accumulation of expensive but rapidly depreciating things.\n\nI imagine you already know that I am much more socialistic in my economic theory than capitalistic. And yet I am not so opposed to capitalism that I have failed to see its relative merits. It started out with a noble and high motive, to block the trade monopolies of nobles, but like most human systems it falls victim to the very thing it was revolting against. So today capitalism has outlived its usefulness. It has brought about a system that takes necessities from the masses to give luxuries to the classes.\n\nThese were the words of a young King writing to his wife, Coretta, in 1952. They were prophetic, and for King\u2019s dream to be real for the next 50 years, black folks are going to have to move beyond their Schoolhouse Rock version of this revolutionary man and recognize that many have been brainwashed into loving a King dream that only Ronald Reagan would recognize. And the sad reality is that the gentrification of our black middle-class neighborhoods was long preceded by the gentrification of our mentalities toward one another as black people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose 14-year-old black boys back in 1980 were privileged to get that Loyola education, and we realized that the doors opened by King had made it possible. But we also knew that we weren\u2019t getting an education just to have good credit and brag about our newest Chinese-sweatshop-built mobile phone. The true meaning of King for the next 50 years is one that makes us care about black people, black community and blackness, not just for altruism\u2019s sake but because we love ourselves. That\u2019s when King\u2019s dream becomes relevant and real, even when we\u2019ve reached middle-class respectability.", "keywords": ["does", "luther", "gentrifiers", "gentrified", "mean", "blacks", "kings", "folks", "philosophy", "king", "martin", "school", "jr", "white", "loyola", "black", "words", "social"], "polarity": 0.050879399521374866, "subjectivity": 0.4182667207049923},

New York-based artist Kehinde Wiley \u2014 known for reimagining traditional Western art and putting African Americans both anonymous and famous as the focus \u2014 was selected to bring the former POTUS\u2019 image on to canvas. Baltimore-based artist Amy Sherald brought FLOTUS to life using oil on linen using a more modern touch, using her signature gray palette.\n\nThis moment, with black artists celebrating black accomplishments, was lost on no one, least of all the Obamas, who noted that they were the first in their families to sit for a portrait.\n\n\u201cI am humbled, I am honored, I am proud. I am so incredibly grateful to all the people who came before me in this journey. The folks who built the foundation upon which I stand,\u201d Michelle Obama told the audience who came to celebrate the big moment. \u201cI am also thinking about all the young people, particularly girls and girls of color, who in years ahead will come to this place and they will look up and see an image of someone who looks like them hanging on the wall of this great American institution.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI know the kind of impact that will have on their lives, because I was one of those girls,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd when I think about those future generations and generations past, I think again, wow. What an incredible journey we are on together in this country.\u201d\n\nIn true Michelle Obama fashion, the first lady in her choice of artist, and in her choice of dress, chose to share her spotlight with rising stars. The dress featured in the portrait was designed by Michelle Smith\u2019s label Milly, and even that had extreme significance, with Sherald sharing how the geometric patterns reminded her of the quilts of Gee\u2019s Bend, a small, remote, black community in Alabama known for its quilt masterpieces.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe former FLOTUS portrait captures her seated, with one hand tucked under her chin as she stares out at those surveying her. Her expression cool, confident, unflinching.\n\n\u201cThe act of Michelle Obama being her authentic self became a profound statement that engaged all of us, because what you represent to this country is an ideal, a human being with integrity, intellect, confidence and compassion,\u201d Sherald, the winner of the 2016 Outwin Boochever Portrait Competition, a rising star in the art world, told the audience.\n\nThe former President, on the other hand, was his usual charming self (please come back) , joking as he surveyed his colorful and vibrant portrait.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cKehinde relative to Amy was working at a disadvantage because his subject was less becoming,\u201d he quipped. \u201cNot as fly.\u201d\n\n\u201cI tried to negotiate less grey hair and Kehinde\u2019s artistic integrity would not allow him to do what I asked. I tried to negotiate smaller ears, struck out on that as well,\u201d the former president said as the audience chuckled.\n\nBarack Obama was painted sitting on a wooden chair among dense foliage with pops of colorful flowers. That was a purposeful touch by artist Wiley, who noted that some of the flowers carry special meaning to the president and his journey through life. The chrysanthemums give a nod to Chicago, the jasmine evokes Hawaii, where the President grew up, and of course the African blue lilies give nod to his Kenyan heritage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe ability to be the first African American to paint the first African American President of the United States; it doesn\u2019t get any better than that,\u201d Wiley said. \u201cI was humbled by this invitation.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr President I thank you for giving me a chance, and I thank you for giving this nation a chance to experience your splendor on a global scale,\u201d the artist added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe newest additions to the gallery will be on view to the public beginning Feb. 13.", "keywords": ["official", "moment", "african", "michelle", "president", "using", "history", "shining", "unveiling", "obama", "artist", "wiley", "black", "portrait", "barack", "obamas", "told"], "polarity": 0.15363906926406928, "subjectivity": 0.39663419913419906},

You could look like the reason God created sex, but there is no way in hell I would ever, ever think of you as anything other than an arousal-ruining deplorable.\n\nWhile this line of logic seems completely appropriate to anyone with decency, the relentlessly repugnant Sean Hannity, not so shockingly, feels otherwise. During a conversation on the June 28 edition of Premiere Radio Network\u2019s The Sean Hannity Show, the conservative kook lamented about how unfair various users of Tinder, Bumble and other online dating apps are being for sending all of his orange homeboys\u2019 supporters to the left (yes, I hear Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s voice now, too, beloved).\n\nThe exchange, courtesy of Media Matters, went as follows:\n\n\n\nSEAN HANNITY (HOST): Alright so I don\u2019t know if you have the same thing, what do they call this matchmaking thing, timber and all that other stuff that they got? Tinder and all that other stuff? KATIE HOPKINS: Yeah, we have that. HANNITY: OK so there apparently Donald Trump according to the Sacramento Bee is saying people will ask straight up do you vote for or do you support Trump. And if you did boom, that\u2019s it. HOPKINS: You\u2019re off. HANNITY: You\u2019re off. Trump voters please swipe left and go to your room and think about what you have done on Tinder. I mean where is this hatred coming from? Salon had to take a Trump free Tuesday day today because they\u2019re so unhinged over there. What\u2019s going on? HOPKINS: Well I mean first things first, Mr. Hannity, I think you and I and the rest of the population should always be very cautious of anybody that meets their date online. Like if you have to form a relationship online it probably means that in real life you\u2019re a bit of a prat and nobody wants to hang out with you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhere is the hatred coming from?\n\nI was always encouraged to avoid asking dumb-ass questions; pity that Hannity was never #Blessed with that nugget of valuable intel. For fellow fools with similar inquiries, seek counsel from a Mexican, a Muslim, one of \u201cthe blacks,\u201d or any woman who both bleeds and has no issue with questioning Bankruptcy Batista. Shoutout to Mika Brzezinski.\n\nMeanwhile, anyone who still questions online dating is a dial-up dummy who needs to get with us broadband baddies. That said, consider the source of such accusations\u2014that folks who date online are social pariahs who can\u2019t function in real life. Folks like Hannity cater to an audience who miss the days of segregated water fountains, so it\u2019s impossible for them to understand how \u201cTimber\u201d works.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe article that riled \u2019em up is titled \u201cHow Donald Trump Is Killing Romance.\u201d In it, writer Angela Hart explores how our current political climate\u2014so nasty, so rude\u2014has impacted those online looking to get some good lovin\u2019, body rockin\u2019, knockin\u2019 boots all night long (yeah). Or, in other cases, real love\u2014the kind Mary J. Blige sang about before Kendu Issacs went and fucked it all up.\n\n\n\nHart reports:\n\n\u201cHis presidency has created this new deal-breaker,\u201d said Laurie Davis Edwards, a relationship coach and founder of the website eflirtexpert.com. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen it like this before, where people say \u2018no\u2019 to Trump supporters, or they only want to date other Trump supporters,\u201d she said. \u201cIt tells me that people are valuing politics much higher as a preference than they were before. ... It\u2019s another example of how massively our dating culture has changed over the past four years, partly because of politics and also because of technology.\u201d Tinder allows people 500 characters to write their profiles. For Bumble, it\u2019s only 300. Since January, many are using that limited space to make it public how much they detest Donald Trump .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn my Tinder profile, I mention that I don\u2019t trust anyone who doesn\u2019t like Beyonc\u00e9. I\u2019ve tried to date Beytheists before, but it\u2019s a fool\u2019s errand. When seeking companionship, you have to find those who align with you spiritually and, yes, politically. Evidently, quite a few folks are only now realizing how important it is not to date anyone who supports someone with the political ideology of a Twitter egg, Klansman or suburbanite complicit in demagoguery.\n\nHart goes on to write:\n\nThe site\u2019s data also underscores what dating experts are seeing: 60 percent of singles say they are less open to dating across party lines than two years ago. It\u2019s more stark among liberals. Conservatives are 57 percent more likely to date across party lines. But if you voted for Trump last election, you may have limited your dating pool. Match found that 91 percent of liberals say they judge potential dates negatively for having voted for Trump, and more than half said they\u2019re more likely to ask about their political views since the election. \u201cPeople are so divided in our country right now that they don\u2019t even want to start a relationship with someone who they don\u2019t agree with politically. I\u2019ve never seen it like this, ever,\u201d Spira said. \u201cBeing on the same political page is more important to singles now than it has ever been in history. It used to be that dating a smoker was a top deal-breaker. That\u2019s been replaced with politics.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI don\u2019t know what planet a lot of you folks were living on, but welcome to the rational side of life. For the life of me, I\u2019ll never understand why it took a 71-year-old man-baby, audacious bigot and overall ignoramus to get many to see what\u2019s already been there. But better late than never, folks.\n\nDo not date people with political views that will drive you mad. There is no middle ground between respecting black lives and not giving a damn about state-sanctioned violence against black women, men and children. There is no accord that can be reached between respecting a woman\u2019s autonomy and thinking Planned Parenthood is a baby-killing factory. No way in hell can you find peace with someone who voted for Peachy Pol Pot.\n\nSean Hannity may feel otherwise, but does anyone really want relationship advice from someone who is so far up 45\u2019s ass that he can smell the bullshit at least 45 minutes before it shows up on our morning Twitter feeds?", "keywords": ["tinder", "political", "sean", "relationship", "dont", "supporters", "cant", "dating", "hannity", "accept", "voted", "online", "date", "trump", "sex"], "polarity": 0.02842938311688312, "subjectivity": 0.46251014610389607},

It was a fight she often waged with a quiet and graceful dignity, while simultaneously raising a family constantly under threat. And while she may not be considered the \u201cMother of the Freedom Movement\u201d\u2014a title typically assigned to Rosa Parks\u2014Coretta was undoubtedly one of its primary muses, a living, breathing symbol of the steadfastness of the American black woman in defense of her family and the freedom of her race.\n\nThe King Center notes:\n\nCoretta Scott King was one of the most influential women leaders in our world. Prepared by her family, education, and personality for a life committed to social justice and peace, she entered the world stage in 1955 as wife of the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and as a leading participant in the American Civil Rights Movement. Her remarkable partnership with Dr. King resulted not only in four children, who became dedicated to carrying forward their parent\u2019s work, but also in a life devoted to the highest values of human dignity in service to social change. Mrs. King traveled throughout the world speaking out on behalf of racial and economic justice, women\u2019s and children\u2019s rights, gay and lesbian dignity, religious freedom, the needs of the poor and homeless, full-employment, health care, educational opportunities, nuclear disarmament and environmental justice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFar before her time, Coretta Scott King also embodied the rare work-life balance so many of us are still seeking, gracefully managing to mother her four children with Martin while consistently supporting, speaking and creating for the movement\u2014including organizing the series of Freedom Concerts that functioned as vital fundraisers for the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.

Not because I think it\u2019s a groupthink catchphrase, but because I have no idea what it means. I\u2019ve never had anyone come up to me and ask me to apologize for my race or my name. Also, it\u2019s a groupthink catchphrase.\n\nAs a matter of fact, I\u2019m probably \u201capologetically black,\u201d because, in my most honest moments, unfettered by the societal implications of class, race and social status, I must admit ... I kinda feel sorry for white people. Not all white people, but I imagine it must be hard going through life not recognizing downbeats and thinking paprika is spicy.\n\nYes, I am apologetically black.\n\nBut apparently some people in St. Joseph\u2019s, Minn., have been repeatedly forced to apologize for their whiteness because USA Today reports that posters saying \u201cUnapologetically White,\u201d \u201cEnd White Guilt\u201d and \u201cWe Have a Right to Exist\u201d popped up around town on Wednesday. The posters are all branded by the St. Cloud State White Student Union, although the college says it is not a registered organization on campus.\n\nHowever, the organization has a Facebook page named St. Cloud White Student Union and describes itself as such:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou know what? I\u2019m not even mad at the St. Cloud State White Student Union; I\u2019m just confused. Apparently, I have been spending my time in the wrong places because I\u2019m never around when people gang up to oppress the populace of ecru-colored martyrs.\n\nI was involved in the Black Student Union while I was in college, but I\u2019d love to attend a White Student Union event. Do they play pinochle like we play spades? Do they discuss how hard it is being white in Minnesota surrounded by so many other alabasterians? Are their field trips to kale farms and HWCUs? Do they throw an off-step show every year for the fraternities and sororities?\n\nOnce, at a Denny\u2019s around 3 a.m. in Goose Creek, S.C., while watching a 52-year-old white dude mop up a drunken white sorority girl\u2019s grits-vomit, I wondered what kind of crazy Caucasian hijinks he was involved in that led to waiting tables during the graveyard shift at a pancake restaurant, when he has every societal advantage and privilege. I mean, he was white! The throw-up girl wasn\u2019t even with me, but as I watched him roll that canary-yellow industrial mop bucket filled with water the color of disappointment and bad decisions, I said a silent prayer for that waiter, and then I told him I was sorry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike I said, I am apologetically black.\n\n\n\nThe St. Cloud State Student Union Facebook page seems to be disliked by most people, and the college and the city of St. Cloud have condemned the posters. Not because they are racist, but because the signs violate the town ordinance against stapling things to telephone poles. What would they expect from those thugs?\n\nBut for the record, I stand with the White Student Union. Someone has to do it. I can\u2019t imagine having control of the media; every part of the local, state and national government; the education system, the banking system, the economy; and politics and the entire damn country and still feeling sorry for myself like a 6-year-old who can\u2019t get an ice cream cone because he\u2019s already eaten too many cookies.

No.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd:\n\nI don\u2019t want to get too deep into conspiracy theories.\n\nPlus:\n\n\n\nIt would be reckless and irresponsible to suggest the Clintons or the DNC had anything to do with it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet here we are.\n\n\n\nIt takes a very special brand of evil to use someone\u2019s killing to deflect from criticism of the current administration. For Hannity, Seth Rich is just another means to help attack the \u201cdestroy Trump media [and] the Democrats.\u201d\n\nI wish I could find a good medium who could help me find Rich and have his spirit curse out Hannity every single morning, noon and night for at least the next five years.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThankfully, enough public outcry pushed advertisers to get Hannity to shut up at least temporarily. Granted, why they would be advertising on a program hosted by a man with a long history of racism and sexism is a troubling thought in and of itself, but at least a line was drawn at the spreading of a conspiracy theory about someone being killed. Still, none of the above was enough for Fox News until the advertisers started pulling away.\n\nThe network\u2019s status as a platform for racists explains the class action suit filed by its employees. The sexism shown on numerous shows goes a long way toward explaining the predatory culture women had to deal with behind the scenes.

Aside from the fact that everyone, including family members, was mysteriously kept away from the Turpin home and the fact that David had racked up $500,000 in debt despite earning six figures as an engineer at Northrop Grumman, the couple looked like they should have been investigated. Even though Deputy Managing Editor Yesha Callahan has repeatedly warned me never to trust men with bangs, if I saw these motherfuckers in line at Target, I\u2019d call the 911 immediately.\n\nI don\u2019t believe in racial profiling, but if the operator asked me what was wrong, I\u2019d tell him or her: \u201cLook, I know these white people have someone chained up at the crib. I can just feel it!\u201d\n\nBut back to the fascinating plot of Taken 2: Wypipo Boogaloo.\n\nEarly Sunday morning, a 17-year-old daughter of the Turpins escaped from her shackles, slipped out of a window and dialed 911 on a cellphone that had been deactivated. When she met authorities, she showed them pictures of her brothers and sisters who were being held captive by her parents, according to the Washington Post\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Riverside County, Calif., Sheriff\u2019s Department looked at the girl\u2019s cellphone photos and decided to perform a welfare check on the home. When officers arrived at the Perris, Calif., home, they discovered 12 of the girl\u2019s siblings all chained to beds throughout the house.\n\nAt first the cops thought they had found a bunch of mistreated children, but it turns out that most of the captive Turpin siblings (ranging in age from 2 to 29) were adults and were so egregiously malnourished that cops assumed that they were kids. In fact, the officers initially estimated that the 17-year-old who escaped was only 10 years old.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI could actually write most of this article with my eyes closed because, before I was assigned this story, I was up in the wee hours of the morning reading about it. Besides being fascinated by the shenanigans of weird Caucasians, my thirst for understanding has always revolved around one central question:\n\n\n\nWhy are white people like this?\n\nI don\u2019t ask that question rhetorically or with an attempt at humor. I have a serious need to know. I stayed up into the wee hours of the morning investigating this story with no expectation of ever writing about it. I wanted to know for myself, but now that the editorial team at The Root has involved you in my search for answers, here\u2019s what I found at the bottom of the rabbit hole I descended into:\n\nThe Turpins have 13 children and have been married for more than 30 years; they renewed their vows in 2015, according to their Facebook page.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAside from their affinity for bangs and Wrangler jeans, they are deeply religious and adhered to the principles of the small-but-growing Christian sect called \u201cQuiverFull.\u201d\n\n\n\nI can hear you asking: \u201cWhat the hell is QuiverFull?\u201d (I have a very good internet connection.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, you can make a QuiverFull souffl\u00e9 all by yourself! All you have to do is take the \u201calt-right,\u201d white supremacist belief of the white genocide movement, sprinkle in a little Christian fundamentalism and\u2014voil\u00e0! You\u2019ve now created a brand-new brand of religious philosophy based on Psalms 127:3-5:\n\n3. Lo, children are an heritage of the Lord: and the fruit of the womb is his reward. 4. As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of the youth. 5. Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQuiverFull is based on the belief that, like pure white people, good Christians are going out of style because they are being outbred by sinners. The only way for God\u2019s people to build an army of Christian conservatives for the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ is by abstaining from birth control and ... you guessed it: fucking.\n\nThe Duggar family from TLC\u2019s 17 Kids and Counting are one of the more prominent adherents of the QuiverFull philosophy, which borrows much of its ideology from the 1985 book The Way Home, by Mary Pride. The book basically says that feminism has wrongly led women to believe that they can achieve happiness without being married, submitting to their husbands and having children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBasically, it\u2019s the belief that women have been indoctrinated with the stupid idea that washing dishes and being obedient to their husbands is not the path to happiness. According to believers, birth control and independence are toxic ideas pushed by the subversive feminist movement to destroy God\u2019s people. (I\u2019m paraphrasing here, but not by much.)\n\nThe movement is estimated to have tens of thousands of adherents, mostly in the United States, and has been plagued by accusations of sexual abuse. Apparently, being fruitful and multiplying has a few negative effects.\n\nMany QuiverFull members, like the Turpins, homeschool their children, which explains why no one noticed the lack of nutrition. The grandparents of the children told reporters that the children memorized long biblical passages during their strict homeschooling, and neighbors stated that the children always looked \u201cvery pale,\u201d according to The Telegraph.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Turpins have been charged with torture and child endangerment.

She was describing Bennett\u2019s participation in a documentary about the story of black people in Chicago, where he lived for 35 years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHis 1963 seminal work, Before the MayFlower, traces Black history from its origins in Western Africa through the trans-Atlantic sojourn that would be slavery, the Reconstruction, and the upheavals of the Civil Rights Movement,\u201d Pearson-McNeil continued.

The magazine complied, adding that \u201chis wise counsel will always be appreciated.\u201d\n\nBennett was born in Clarksdale, Miss., and grew up in Jackson.

He has always considered Morehouse as the center of his academic development. After graduating, Bennett formally entered the world of journalism as a reporter for the now defunct Atlanta Daily World. He became the city editor for the magazine and worked there until 1953, when he began his work as an associate editor at Jet magazine in Chicago, Illinois. In 1954, Bennett became an associate editor at Ebony and he was promoted to senior editor of the magazine in 1958. Since then, his comprehensive articles have become one of the magazine\u2019s literary hallmarks.\u201d He retired in 2005.\n\nAt Morehouse, Bennett was a classmate of Martin Luther King Jr., Mohr wrote.\n\nMohr\u2019s story also said, \u201cIn 2006 he was inducted into the Hall of Fame of the National Association of Black Journalists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn February, Bennett\u2019s footprints and those of 12 others were added to the International Civil Rights Walk of Fame near the Atlanta church where King preached.

But in the short term, the Trump-backed immigration proposal, combined with other recent moves by the administration and its allies \u2014 support for voter suppression, gerrymandering and various other schemes to disenfranchise minority voters \u2014 could extend the white hegemony that brought Trump to power and sustains Republicans.\n\n\u201cFor ages, Republicans said that their beef was with illegal immigrants and that legal immigrants should be embraced and welcomed. No longer. In the immigration fight on the Hill, there is broad bipartisan consensus to legalize the \u2018dreamers\u2019 \u2014 illegal immigrants brought here as children \u2014 and to fortify border security. The dispute is really about the Trump proposal to rein in legal immigration by undoing the family-based approach, in which immigrants petition to bring over immediate family, that has always been at the heart of U.S. immigration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThough details aren\u2019t yet known, estimates are that the legislation would cut legal immigration, currently 1.1 million per year, by 300,000 to 500,000 annually.

Everything is about to change\u2014or so it seems\u2014as designers present fashion shows featuring clothes generally intended to break the rules. But one thing rarely, if ever, seems to change, and that\u2019s the absence of black designers occupying top spots in the fashion industry.\n\nFreelance designer and journalist Kibwe Chase-Marshall recently published an op-ed in Business of Fashion\u2014one of the most respected media outlets for fashion-industry reporting\u2014titled, \u201cWhy Aren\u2019t There More Black Designers?\u201d It\u2019s a question I\u2019ve asked myself nearly every time I\u2019ve gone into work over my 30-year career in fashion. Why?\n\nAll too often, I\u2019m the only person of color on set doing any job. The rare exception is on the catwalk, where the sheer number of people required to produce a fashion show calls for hiring more than one black person, simply by default.

And now he\u2019s breaking that glass ceiling by breaking the silence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Jan. 3, an action-oriented social media campaign, #BreakSilenceBreakCeilings, went live. The campaign was conceived by Chase-Marshall and aimed at breaking the unwritten and unspoken rule of discriminatory hiring practices in fashion, an industry that Chase-Marshall says does not have a \u201cdiversity problem\u201d but, rather, a \u201cblack-people problem.\u201d\n\nHimself a talented technical draftsman, stylist and cutter, Chase-Marshall is not content to simply illustrate the talent of black designers as a solution to the problem. In February, I was on a steering committee for the Black Designers Exhibition and Symposium at the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology, which shed light on the fierce beauty of too-little-seen talent and started the conversation as to why\u2014but did not offer us a plan to advance the battle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChase-Marshall has tailored a solution to fit the problem, noting in his op-ed, \u201cFed up with watching this most blatant form of discrimination thrive, while the broader industry capitalizes on Black celebrity associations and the recent uptick in Black casting, I decided to do something.\u201d\n\nChase-Marshall, who stopped working full time in design studios in 2010 after 13 years, now makes a living as a freelance designer and writer for publications like Elle. He has devised a plan of action for the Council of Fashion Designers of America and Vogue, which collaborate on the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund, the most powerful entity in the American\u2014if not global\u2014luxury-garment industry, which has promoted some of the most successful black designers in recent memory, such as Tracy Reese and Cushnie and Ochs.\n\nChase-Marshall would like to see CFDA/Vogue adopt a program with greater oversight of its design-industry members, such as offering immersive training for hiring managers in elimination of bias, along with CFDA/Vogue\u2019s annual disclosure and endorsement of participating brands, along with annual statistics regarding the racial composition of their design teams.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s what the industry can do, but to consumers who want to take a stand against inequality and appropriation, Chase-Marshall posted:\n\nLet\u2019s do something: If you agree that it\u2019s time for the community of fashion design professionals to be taken to task regarding employment/advancement discrimination against qualified black candidates, along with liking this post, comment #breaksilencebreakceilings and tag @CFDA, @Voguemagazine, @Bof, @nytimes, and @wwd below. In addition, forward this post to 5 friends (or more) that you feel care to affect overdue change.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBlackness, until very recently, was seen as an unmarketable quality,\u201d says Chase-Marshall, who hails from Trinidad, was raised in Washington, D.C., and was a classmate of the Clinton and Gore children. But despite having the clubby connections to wealth and power that headhunters prize for their potential to move the needle when it comes to selling expensive designer clothing, he was discounted, simply because of the color of his skin.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if someone is racist,\u201d Chase-Marshall says. \u201cI care if people use discriminatory hiring practices.\u201d His is neither a call for affirmative action nor a call for quotas\u2014which can undercut recognition of real talent\u2014but, rather, a call for education transparency and accountability that can create lasting change within the fashion industry.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019m proud of Chase-Marshall for pushing us beyond merely saying that we have the right to more than just exist and be seen in the fashion industry. It\u2019s our responsibility to demand, not only of fashion but also of our trendsetting selves, that our spending be reflected in the identities of the images marketed to us, as well as that our dollars come back into our communities through the black talent being paid and promoted according to their true worth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInspired by Muhammad Ali and Colin Kaepernick, Chase-Marshall, who currently engages in every type of freelance work, from designing pull-up diapers to diamond rings, wants to be the kind of person who \u201cprioritizes their integrity over their paycheck.\u201d He broke his silence \u201cbecause you can\u2019t continue to play a losing game.\u201d Now it\u2019s time for the powerful consumers black women are to suit up and make the fashion industry play ball.", "keywords": ["missing", "designer", "fashion", "chasemarshall", "hiring", "talent", "simply", "designers", "problem", "action", "black", "industry"], "polarity": 0.12858133650387174, "subjectivity": 0.4944134503993659},

She has never injured anyone. She doesn\u2019t even have a criminal record. But after her husband massacred 49 people in Orlando, Fla.\u2019s Pulse nightclub on June 12, 2016, an FBI agent said that he \u201crealized that she knew\u201d about the attack. The FBI also discovered that Salman may have given her husband some gas money that he used in his car.\n\nSo despite the fact that she denounced the Islamic State group and terrorism a year before the attack, even though she did not help plan or finance the shooting, Salam will stand trial in March for aiding and abetting by providing material support to a terrorist organization.\n\nIn the eyes of the government, Noor Salman is a terrorist.\n\n\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Stephen Miller, government staffers and other officials sat in the room and heard President Donald Trump disparage Haiti as a \u201cshithole country.\u201d They did not challenge him. None of the lawmakers who probably represent Haitians and Nigerians walked out of the room and told the press about Trump\u2019s tirade.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite the fact that there is no evidence any of these men encouraged Trump to say these words, even though they did not endorse his statement, they remained silent. They knew.\n\nThese men are white supremacists.\n\nEvery headline you will read about Trump\u2019s comments will place the blame solely on him and adeptly leap over the obvious fact that he felt comfortable enough in the company of this gaggle of old white men to disparage the residents of an entire country with his racist tangent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe recent revelations are not just an indictment of Trump\u2019s racism; they are indicative of the attitudes of every single person in that room.\n\nThat\u2019s how white supremacy works.\n\nThis has nothing to do with the ethereal concept of \u201cnormalizing\u201d racism. This is a brick-and-mortar example of how men nonchalantly spread the evil form of oppression that has plagued this country for centuries and then lackadaisically go about their business as if nothing happened.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause for them, nothing happened.\n\n\u201cHe who passively accepts evil is as much involved in it as he who helps to perpetrate it. He who accepts evil without protesting against it is really cooperating with it.\u201d \u2014Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nThis weekend and Monday, America will celebrate the legacy of the civil rights revolutionary Martin Luther King Jr. Whenever any black person utters words that make white people adjust their collars, white people unfailingly respond with a variation of the phrase \u201cbut not all white people.\u201d If they are bold enough, they might even challenge you with the Super Saiyan Caucasian preamble of all preambles: \u201cWhat would Martin Luther King say about ... \u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, on this particular issue, we know what King would have said because he already said it.\n\nIn 1964, after he won the Nobel Peace Prize, most of white Atlanta didn\u2019t acknowledge it. The city where he was born and where he lived didn\u2019t even try to honor King until Robert Woodruff, president of Coca-Cola, decided to sponsor a banquet. He still couldn\u2019t get the white elite to attend until the New York Times wrote a scathing article about the efforts to undermine the event and Coca-Cola threatened to leave the city.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the tickets sold out, many people assumed that King would take it easy on the powerful people who had reluctantly gathered to honor him. When he gave his speech, he spoke directly to the powerful men who had remained quiet during the brutality of the civil rights movement:\n\nHistory will have to record that the greatest tragedy of this period of social transition was not the strident clamor of the bad people, but the appalling silence of the good people.\n\nMartin Luther King Jr. was wrong, though.\n\nHistory has yet to record the tragedy of the people who sat silently in the room on Thursday when Trump besmirched the nation of Haiti and other black and brown countries. History still has not listed the names in the room when he said that Haitians \u201call have AIDS\u201d and Nigerians live in huts. Their names are nowhere to be found alongside the list of neo-Nazis and Klansmen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot only was King incorrect when he assured us of history\u2019s note-taking, but he was doubly wrong when he described the people who remained appallingly silent as \u201cgood people.\u201d Sidestepping evil for the sake of political favor or not upsetting the apple cart is the opposite of \u201cgood.\u201d These people are co-conspirators. They are accomplices. They are guilty of aiding and abetting by providing material support to white supremacy.\n\nNot only are they at fault, but they join a long list of those complicit with Trump\u2019s brand of racism. Their names should appear alongside those of the pearl-clutching congregation of reporters, celebrities and generic-label white people distancing themselves from \u201cthe Donald\u201d as they pretend to just realize that he has racist tendencies.\n\nThey should register with the 53 percent of white women who voted for a robeless Klansman, along with the lawmakers who embrace him and his policies. The names of kowtowing Negroes like Steve Harvey, Ray Lewis, Stephen A. Smith, Omarosa Manigault Newman and Chrisette Michele, who implored us to respect a man who would shit down our throats for the spectacle of it, should be etched into those history books, too. They all worked on the road crew that paved the way for a white supremacist to gain respect and power. They paid for the fuel in his car.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is why I am never ashamed to say that I voted for someone just because he or she is black. This is why \u201cdiversity\u201d can never be a bad word. If we are not seated at the table, not only are our voices unheard, but the evil ones are emboldened. This is why \u201cnot all white people\u201d rings hollow in my ears. All the white people in the room at both events stayed silent. Silence is racism. Racism is evil.\n\nThose same silent voices omitted from history will probably participate in the praising of Martin Luther King Jr. this weekend. They will talk about freedom and equality for all people. They will do it loudly and publicly because they know that they will always have the opportunity to slit our throats behind closed doors without a single objection.\n\nOur only hope remains in the unseen recompense of the invisible, omnipotent God who King believed would avenge the sins of these evil men. He told us: \u201cThe hottest place in hell is reserved for those who remain neutral in times of great moral conflict.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI guess we\u2019ll have to wait for that.\n\nI just hope they don\u2019t run out of room.", "keywords": ["room", "evil", "luther", "racism", "say", "silence", "silent", "shithole", "martin", "white", "king", "jr", "men", "trumps", "names"], "polarity": -0.049145809490637064, "subjectivity": 0.4577242042759285},

How did you think the coverage did now in hindsight?\n\n\u201cALEXANDER: I feel like the follow-up coverage sort of caught up to the facts relatively quickly.

I\u2019m fluent as shit in slang, but I\u2019m fuck-all in abbreviations.\n\nSuggest places to purchase electronics.\n\nDid you know that white men go to stores where they don\u2019t know anybody that works there and pay full price for electronic items that come in sealed boxes?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCrazy, right?\n\nI told one of my white compadres that I was looking for a new TV so he recommended a spot. When I asked him who I need to look for (because, you know, *wink wink*, gonna get that hook-up) he just stared at me. Then I remembered that white dudes make more money than everyone else and he could actually afford the shit I\u2019m breaking my own bank to front to get. Then I called my homie and two days later I picked up my new TV in the parking lot beside a Costco.\n\nOrder shots for the table.\n\nIt always starts the same way. You\u2019re out with your white friends having a few drinks, maybe watching the game, or doing something else alcoholically benign when the server brings over a tray of Jameson shots and then Ryan from Account Services does that dumb ass shrug while saying, \u201cUh oh, looks like it\u2019s a round of Jamo for the crew!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you thought this was just a benevolent gesture of friendship, you thought wrong. As soon as you accept that first shot, you\u2019re agreeing to take a trip down the road to white boy wasted that only ends with you sitting at your desk the next morning wearing Ray Bans indoors, guzzling a Pedialyte, and trying to ignore Ryan when he says, \u201cHey brah, I\u2019m sorry if things got a little crazy last night. I\u2019ll buy you a new phone.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd all you can do is shake your head as you pick glitter out of your beard.\n\n\n\nCarry guns.\n\nLook, I\u2019m not saying that white men are more prone to violence or have some natural inclination to shoot people. What I am saying is that I\u2019m not clear on what the parameters are for getting shot by a white guy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHear me out. When it comes to black people shooting black people, I have a firm understanding of how, why, and when I might get that iron pulled on me:\n\n-Selling dope in the wrong neighborhood.\n\n-Owing the wrong muthafucka some money.\n\n-Snitching.\n\n-Escalated disrespect in a public setting.\n\nAll those can and will get you shot by another black person. But with white guys, they just kinda shoot everyone, sometimes en masse, and usually no one knows why. I think we need to have a moratorium of firearms sales to white men until they can draft a clear memo detailing their shooting protocol (other than the cops just shooting black folks \u2018cause they can) so that people know what parts of town are clear and shit.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhite people always want to ask me if my neighborhood is safe to visit at night, I feel like I\u2019m owed the same courtesy.\n\nBe in charge of like, everything.\n\nIt goes without saying that, after about a 600 year or so run, white guys have had a pretty good go of the whole Eurocentric patriarchic power structure thing. And while I\u2019m sure that they\u2019d point to history as precedent as to why white men seem to be in charge of everything, have they ever asked themselves a.) why they seem to be in charge of everything and, b.) should they reasonably be in charge of everything?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith the recent release of Michael Wolff\u2019s Fire and Fury and the unflattering portrait it paints of the Trump Administration, I\u2019ve seen conservative (mostly white male) commentators alleging that the stories in the book must be fabrications or exaggerations. And of course, they would. In their minds, they probably see an assembly of seemingly successful white dudes in their rightful seat of power where they (by virtue of their whiteness and maleness) shouldn\u2019t have any problems because they project success onto other white men. Ineptitude or incompetence or plain ol\u2019 stupidity aren\u2019t traits that they\u2019ve been conditioned to see in themselves (those are for the women and the coloreds) so why would they see them in their peers?\n\nThis feeds the broader point. Maybe, just maybe, being a white man isn\u2019t enough. Maybe, the Trump Administration\u2019s flaws are indicative of a larger logical fallacy that we\u2019ve fallen into and perhaps other dominions of white male supremacy are just as fucked up. Banks? Higher education? Corporate America? Perhaps they\u2019re all inhabited by a bunch of mediocre white guys who keep getting the benefit of the doubt because success has been projected upon them by their peers.\n\n\n\nJuxtapose this with Sunday night\u2019s Golden Globes, where the spirit of unanimity and solidarity for inclusion and equality for women and minorities was on display beyond a mere act of sartorial activism. The Time\u2019s Up movement\u2019s presence in conjunction with Oprah Winfrey\u2019s clarion speech extolling viewers to focus on the horizon ahead stand in stark contrast with the #MAGA crowd and their insistence on perpetuating the fantasy of the patriarchal status quo. Or, simply stated, Auntie Oprah speaks for the America that, in spite of itself, could be. Diverse in its leadership, empathetic in its promise, and equitable in the distribution of its justice. Trump and his followers speak for an America that never was and will never be. But success is not zero sum; in order for others to gain, it\u2019s not as if white men have to lose.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs we stand at the fulcrum between Oprah\u2019s optimism and Trump\u2019s Trumpism, we all have to ask ourselves how long we can be denied our own equitable seats at the table for the sake of giving in to an antiquated norm. The evidence shows that, try as they might, we can\u2019t just let the white guys do it all by themselves. Hell, perhaps they created systems of discrimination and oppression because they knew that all along and hoped we\u2019d never find out.\n\n\n\nToo late.", "keywords": ["im", "stop", "things", "probably", "saying", "charge", "know", "letting", "white", "men", "wrong", "black", "maybe", "guys"], "polarity": -0.0051354953897326805, "subjectivity": 0.409657868026512},

The hallmarks of her collection are striking silhouettes with the ease of American sportswear, blazing with her hand-drawn prints or undulating hand-sewn textures based on the ancient history of African civilizations. If you\u2019re looking for a showstopper\u2014you\u2019ve found it here.\n\nThe Glow Up: What\u2019s your idea of glamour for holiday dressing?\n\nMimi Plange: Holiday glamour is about having fun with your personal style\u2014it\u2019s a celebration! It\u2019s about your interpretation of bold color, festive jewel tones and metallics. It\u2019s about your shine without compromising comfort; at the end of the day, it\u2019s about relaxing and enjoying family and friends.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: What makes a woman look sexy?\n\nMP: Only confidence can make you look sexy. Never clothes.\n\nTGU: Who\u2019s your muse?\n\nMP: When I design, I imagine a woman who has a strong sense of self; someone who isn\u2019t interested in labels or monograms. A cultured woman who loves art and exquisite details. She doesn\u2019t want to be like anyone else. She is a leader\u2014a disruptive woman, who understands that her wardrobe is a reflection of her and not the collective society. This is my muse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: What\u2019s a daring item every woman should add to her wardrobe for evening?\n\nMP: Ostrich feathers are magnificent in pastels and a staple in black. It\u2019s a soft, romantic and bold item at the same time. I love the way the light and airy feathers move on their own as you walk. It\u2019s basically sparkles without actual sparkles. I also love neon accents for accessories and shoes.\n\nTGU: What does 2018 have in store for Mimi Plange?\n\nMP: In 2018 we will launch our ready-to-wear collection online and make it available for our customers.

After years of modeling, it wasn\u2019t an unfamiliar scenario, but this was different. I wasn\u2019t being fit for a retailer\u2019s catalog or campaign, but for one of the biggest nights of my life. I was fitting for the Grammys, as a first-time nominee.\n\nMy trusty stylist had managed to procure samples from a few known designers\u2014difficult for an unknown artist\u2014but would they fit? At the time, because of a restrictive diet and rigorous daily gym habit, I was a size 6 (a lifestyle choice that ran contrary to my ongoing career as a plus-size model). It was the smallest I\u2019d ever be as an adult. But even at my smallest, after years spent in the modeling industry, I also knew that my average-black-girl proportions\u2014thick thighs, wide hips and a voluptuousness that wouldn\u2019t be exercised into submission\u2014weren\u2019t an ideal fit for high fashion.\n\nNearly eight years later, my diet is far less strict, and my steadfast hourglass has returned to a luscious 12-14. But when Leslie Jones was recently denied by multiple designers while searching for a dress for her Ghostbusters premiere, I intimately felt her pain. Like Leslie, I was forced to have an outfit custom-made because even the samples I managed to fit were sadly devoid of personality and often ill-fitting.\n\nNo amount of success or self-care could shield either of us from the humiliating fact that when it came to high fashion, our size somehow made us unworthy of inclusion. Instead, our bodies were somehow expected to offer an apology to an industry that refused to accommodate us instead of recognizing each and every body\u2019s right to look and feel good.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs it turns out, Leslie and I weren\u2019t alone in taking matters into our own hands. After decades spent watching designers largely ignore even their own body types in their collections (see Anna Sui and the formerly full Donna Karan, among others), it\u2019s no surprise that models and celebrities alike have begun to capitalize on a market that remains underserved even while the press praises a more body-positive climate. For lack of better options, Ashley Graham, Melissa McCarthy and, soon, Orange Is the New Black\u2019s Dascha Polanco\u2014who just took body positivity to new heights by attending a runway show in a thigh-baring bodysuit\u2014are among those channeling their fame, experience and frustration into creating fashion that flatters figures like their own.\n\nBut what of the established designers, who have long possessed the resources and influence to be more inclusive? The party line is that fuller figures are more difficult to design for, but occasionally, the truth is far more brutal: They are simply not interested. We not only don\u2019t fit their clothes; we don\u2019t fit their brand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs I write this, New York Fall Fashion Week is in full swing. Early in my career, walking the runway for pioneering retailer Lane Bryant or for a smattering of department store events were among the rare opportunities offered full-figured models during NYFFW. But this year, Christian Siriano\u2014who both famously came to Leslie Jones\u2019 rescue and created his own capsule collection for Lane Bryant\u2014did the unthinkable: He cast several plus-size models in his fall presentation, with neither fanfare nor kitsch.\n\n\u201cI am just trying to show you that you can do it, you can celebrate everyone. \u2026 The clothes looked just as amazing on [the plus models] as everyone else,\u201d he noted in an interview with Refinery29.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile perhaps the most visible, Siriano isn\u2019t the only designer featuring a diversity of bodies on the runway this season. Designer Tracy Reese upped her #BlackGirlMagic quotient by announcing that she\u2019ll now offer at least a portion of her line in extended sizes (up to a size 18/2X), and backed it up by casting a range of people of varying ages and sizes in her show. Legendary designer Byron Lars celebrated the 25th year of his eponymous label (now available in sizes 0-22) with a show themed \u201cExclusive Inclusion,\u201d featuring models and personalities up to a size 18. And sportswear designer Chromat continued a commitment to diverse presentations by featuring not only a variety of body types but also differently abled and transgender models.\n\nSo, yes, the body-positive movement is progressing, and obviously I\u2019m here for it, having invested my career in helping to forward the narrative. But are we really expected to pat designers on the back for acknowledging the obvious: that not only bigger bodies but bigger dollars await them on the other side of inclusion? And for black and brown women in particular, is it fair to ask us to ignore the fact that the bodies the fashion industry consistently seems so incapable of acknowledging most often resemble our own, and our mothers\u2019, sisters\u2019 and friends\u2019?\n\nNo one needs to tell any marginalized group how much representation matters. Being represented honestly and positively in the public perception is something we fight for every day. For the 100 million plus-size women in America alone, our exclusion from the aspirational market that is high fashion is nothing short of defeminizing. Diversity of bodies on the catwalk is a beginning, but without a broader diversity of options in the stores, it\u2019s an empty gesture at best.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Project Runway mentor Tim Gunn notes in an op-ed for the Washington Post, the fashion industry\u2019s dismissal of bigger body types is not only a \u201cdisgrace\u201d but also downright delusional. He states, \u201c[T]his is now the shape of women in this nation, and designers need to wrap their minds around it.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s right. But as a black woman who\u2019s spent the last two decades of my life advocating for respect and representation not only for my race and gender but also the particular body I inhabit, the words that most often come to mind are instead Sojourner\u2019s.\n\nAfter all, \u201cain\u2019t I a woman?\u201d\n\nMaiysha Kai is a Grammy-nominated singer-songwriter, fashion model, devoted auntie and Brooklyn, N.Y.-based, single black bombshell who recently strutted into her 40s.

King was acutely aware that segregation sustains racial inequality in schools and other institutions. Education reform without an explicit attempt to dismantle the sources of inequality isn\u2019t a moon shot toward justice; it is simply a maladjustment to injustice.\n\nA recent Associated Press analysis of national school-enrollment data found that \u201cas of school year 2014-2015, more than 1,000 of the nation\u2019s 6,747 charter schools had minority enrollment of at least 99 percent, and the number has been rising steadily.\u201d\n\nA startling number, but the charter school lobby essentially responded with a version of, \u201cSo what?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAcademics, attorneys and activists can hold any opinion they want about public charter schools and other families\u2019 school choices,\u201d said a spokesperson for the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools in an official response to the AP story. \u201cIn the end, parents\u2019 and students\u2019 opinions are the only ones that matter. And every year, more parents are choosing charter schools.\u201d\n\nNew York magazine columnist Jonathan Chait co-signed that dismissal of segregation with a column that essentially argued it\u2019s not really the job of charter schools to change the system of oppression that created schools that perform poorly, \u201cbecause integrating schools is hard,\u201d and he calls the criticism of increased segregation among charters merely a \u201ctalking point.\u201d For Chait, rising test scores trump segregation concerns.\n\nIn the all-charter district of New Orleans\u2014which Chait described at the 2015 anniversary of Hurricane Katrina as \u201cspectacular\u201d in another defense of charters\u2014virtually no (less than 1 percent) white students attend schools that have earned a D or F performance rating. But 77 percent of white students are enrolled in A- or B-rated schools, according to a new report (pdf) by nonprofit advocacy group Urban League of Louisiana. It is unthinkable that this situation would be tolerated if the students\u2019 races were reversed. It is clear that segregation, and who gets a high-quality choice, matters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn their recent study, \u201cBalancing Act: Schools, Neighborhoods, and Racial Imbalance,\u201d my colleagues at the Brookings Institution\u2014Richard V. Reeves, Nathan Joo and Grover J. \u201cRuss\u201d Whitehurst\u2014compared the racial composition of the country\u2019s public schools with that of the under-18 population of those neighborhoods. They found that schools more or less look like the neighborhoods that host them.\n\n\u201cThe average public school is 2.6 percent less white, 1.8 percent more black, 0.9 percent more Hispanic, and 0.3 percent more Asian than its surrounding neighborhood,\u201d the study found. No surprise there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe segregated state of our schools helps maintain the inequitable funding that determines families\u2019 educational options. When the government-backed Home Owners\u2019 Loan Corp. developed color-coded maps to sort out who could receive mortgage lending, blacks who lived in the red sections of the map were not given loans. And of course, the most well-resourced schools just happen to be located in the most expensive neighborhoods.\n\nThe Brookings team looked closely at district lines, and they found that if you remove them, many schools become more racially imbalanced. It seems to me that wealthy neighborhoods are using district lines to leverage themselves against demographic shifts. According to EdBuild, a nonprofit focused on school-finance issues, the most egregious cases of segregation are shown by the roughly 36 districts that were formed since 2000 as a result of secession\u2014when a school district splits from a larger one.\n\nU.S. News & World Report explained the study\u2019s results: \u201cIn almost all cases, the communities involved were less diverse and had higher property values than those they left behind.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Brookings report found that among the racially imbalanced schools, charters stood out as having a much higher representation of black students. Their imbalance rating is roughly four times that of traditional public schools. (You can see how your school compares through this interactive map.) Charters didn\u2019t cause segregation, but they sure aren\u2019t helping matters.\n\nIn many cases, school district lines are the most potent Confederate monuments that we still need to take down. Proponents of charter schools say that by disrupting school districts that were largely created along discriminatory and segregated lines, charters improve the number of options you have. And sure, giving kids a quality education is an excellent goal. But getting to the source of inequity is real reform.\n\nIn many cases, school district lines are the most potent Confederate monuments that we still need to take down.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a statement in response to the AP story, Shavar Jeffries, national president of Democrats for Education Reform, said sarcastically, \u201cApparently, the school segregation problem boils down to Black and Brown parents choosing schools that aren\u2019t White enough, as if the doors of all-White schools would magically open if only they had the good sense to seek to enroll their children in them.\u201d\n\n\n\nWe shouldn\u2019t conflate insincere calls for diversity (read: making schools whiter) with demands to topple segregated schools. Schools should get the resources they need, whether or not middle-class white students attend them. Our fascination with inclusion is inherently corrupt because it is born of the misconception that whiter schools are better. Jeffries makes this point. But education reform absent an effort to dismantle segregated schools is equally bad. To blame teachers, parents and district bureaucracy (especially when they are black) is to ignore the history of how schools became depressed. To dismiss segregation is to accept structural inequality and the status quo.\n\nWe\u2019ve simply given up on the radical idea of integrating schools. The last major effort occurred in 2007, in the Supreme Court case Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1. The court ruled that Seattle and Louisville, Ky., school districts\u2019 efforts to desegregate/integrate schools by using individuals\u2019 race to place students in schools were unconstitutional. The \u201cdiverse by design\u201d coalition, a group of deliberately integrated schools that poses more of a threat to structural inequality, offers some hope.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe AP study pointed to the right problem with charter schools: an overrepresentation of black and brown students. As the AP report states, \u201c[L]evels of segregation correspond with low achievement levels at schools of all kinds.\u201d What the AP report, Chait and some charter advocates haven\u2019t said is how willing we are to experiment with the lives of black students and black-majority school districts instead of doing the hard work to eradicate the causes of segregation.\n\nMake no mistake: Segregated schools of the past and present are a result of horrible policy choices that most people are willing to accept. There is a reason that after more than 20 years, the research is mixed on charter schools. Schools in black and brown communities were built on broken foundations\u2014e.g., segregation. By not addressing segregation, reformers are turning off the stove when the house is going up in flames.\n\nThis story was produced by the Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education, in partnership with The Root.", "keywords": ["schools", "complicit", "charter", "students", "segregation", "school", "district", "white", "movement", "segregated", "report", "black"], "polarity": 0.0736423974255833, "subjectivity": 0.4108700787904325},

It\u2019s one of the most accepted aphorisms of all time, because hate is easy. Hate gets to conceal its identity under white sheets and pointed hoods as it lights crosses on lawns. Hate hides behind computer screens and anonymously hurls the n-word on social media. Hate smiles in your face and stabs you in New York City\u2019s Times Square.\n\nMaybe that\u2019s why haters hate\u2014because there are no consequences. It is easy to spread racism and prejudice when there is no fear of repercussions. If there were someone fearless and committed enough to unmask the faces of hatemongers, maybe haters would have second thoughts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeet Daryle Lamont Jenkins\u2014neo-Nazi hunter.\n\n\n\nFor more than 30 years, Jenkins has dedicated his life to chasing down white supremacists and exposing them to the glare of public scrutiny. His unapologetic style of reap-what-you-sow justice mixes the Southern Poverty Law Center\u2019s meticulous method of cataloging hate groups with the guerrilla vigilantism of Anonymous. Jenkins is relentless in his quest to drag fascists out of the shadows and into the disinfecting sunlight, and has amassed a network of photographers, reporters and regular citizens dedicated to his cause.\n\n\u201cI was always interested in this stuff,\u201d said Jenkins, a native of Somerset, N.J. \u201cWhen I saw pictures and news footage of Klansmen and people terrorizing activists during the civil rights era, I always wondered, \u2018Where did these people go?\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat simple quest sent him on a mission that eventually blossomed into his life\u2019s work. He became obsessed with newspaper articles and press clippings about Ku Klux Klan rallies, but it was The Oprah Winfrey Show that jump-started him into the arena of public activism.\n\n\u201cOprah was where I really started. In the late \u201980s, she did a show on skinheads,\u201d Jenkins told The Root in an exclusive one-on-one interview. \u201cBack then, the only way I had to save this information was to record it on videotape. I taped that first show and began saving all of this information. I still have all of those videos.\u201d\n\nAs a member of the alternative music and punk rock scene, Jenkins adopted the underground \u201cfanzine\u201d method of publicity and began sharing his information with others, and even started his own cable-access show. He scanned the New York area\u2019s burgeoning conservative radio programs and began to notice the growing connections between the conservative movement and the fringe right.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThese mainstream, right-wing hosts like Bob Grant would regularly have guests like Jared Taylor on their radio shows,\u201d said Jenkins.\n\nThe SPLC, one of the country\u2019s most well-known and respected organizations that document hate groups for media and law-enforcement agencies, describes Taylor as a \u201ccourtly presenter of ideas that most would describe as crudely white supremacist\u2014a kind of modern-day version of the refined but racist colonialist of old.\u201d\n\nIn 1999, Jenkins started a small website dedicated to revealing the ties between fringe groups and the conservative movement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis was back in the days before everybody was on the internet,\u201d he reminisced. \u201cThis was a Geocities website!\u201d\n\nAfter a few minutes with Jenkins, you begin to wonder why he even needs a website, or videotapes, because he seems to have an encyclopedic memory of racist groups and individuals that borders on being a rare form of white supremacist savant. He spits out the names of harbingers of hate as if he knows them personally\u2014and, in a sense, he does.\n\nOne of the many names that Jenkins rattled off was Bob Grant\u2019s talk-radio successor, who caught Jenkins\u2019 attention more than two decades ago. In 1996, Jenkins discovered a radio show on New York\u2019s WABC, and he has kept his eye on its host ever since. In Jenkins\u2019 view, this host\u2019s ascendance to fame epitomizes how mainstream media enables extremists by giving them platforms to spread their message. \u201cI mean, this guy would promote guests like Hal Turner, a white nationalist from North Bergen [N.J.], who ran for Congress,\u201d Jenkins explained. \u201cBut if you even mention Hal Turner now, he will ban you from his show!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe \u201cthis guy\u201d to whom Jenkins refers is Fox News commentator, and right-wing superhero, Sean Hannity.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t trust Sean Hannity when it comes to race,\u201d said Jenkins. \u201cFor one thing, he constantly defends white people who use the n-word. People like Dog the Bounty Hunter, Don Imus and Dr. Laura Schlessinger. He seems to love the nastiest elements of the far right.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHate has consequences.\u201d\n\nThat simple sentence is the motto and clarion call for One People\u2019s Project, an organization dedicated to researching and reporting on \u201cright-wing groups, individuals and activities, and encourages society to be vigilant against them in an effort to diminish their ability to function and cause that society harm.\u201d Jenkins started the project and website in 2000 after Richard Barrett, leader of the white nationalist group the Nationalist Movement, organized a rally in Morristown, N.J.\n\nNoticing the rise of hate groups in the Northeast, Jenkins realized that the mainstream press seemed unconcerned. \u201cIf they won\u2019t cover it, we will\u201d was the mantra with which Jenkins began One People\u2019s Project. Since starting the group, Jenkins has enlisted journalists, photographers, videographers and anyone who wants to expose organized hate groups. Over the years, One People\u2019s Project has outed legions of racists through its \u201cRogues Gallery\u201d\u2014a database of individuals who have demonstrable extremist ties.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of Jenkins\u2019 most used tactics is simply attending white nationalist conferences and taking photos and video. Instead of concentrating on the known figures, Jenkins wants to find the troublemakers before they explode. He scans crowds with his camera at neofascist rallies and events and later examines the footage, trying to cross-reference it with other internet data and social media.\n\nOne People\u2019s Project had photos of James O\u2019Keefe in 2006, years before he secretly taped, and heavily edited, videos that led to the demise of the community group ACORN. In the pictures, O\u2019Keefe poses with members of a white nationalist group and Andrew Breitbart, a then barely known publisher of a different kind of website named after himself.\n\nJenkins also utilizes \u201csock puppets\u201d\u2014fake social media accounts used to befriend people in hate groups, get on their friends\u2019 lists and see where the trail leads. It sometimes yields interesting discoveries. In 2014, when Anna Zubkova was running for a judgeship in Plainfield, Conn., One People\u2019s Project found her husband\u2019s white supremacist blog and blasted it to the national media.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of One People\u2019s Project\u2019s most controversial practices is \u201cdoxxing\u201d white nationalists. Popularized by the secretive internet group Anonymous, doxxing (from \u201cdocumenting\u201d) is the activity of publicizing someone\u2019s name, address and private information. While many people debate the issue, Jenkins\u2019 stance on the topic is unwavering: \u201cI\u2019m not sorry to say, I don\u2019t have sympathy for white supremacists.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, One People\u2019s Project doxxed John Stortstrom, an Army engineer with security clearance who worked at the Army\u2019s chemical and explosive facility. The Project posted his picture and job description after Stortstrom attended a white nationalist conference with 150 other extremists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s run for the White House forced mainstream media to take note of the so-called alt-right\u2014a term Jenkins hates. \u201cI call them white supremacists; neo-fascists. \u2018Alt-right\u2019 is their term to try to clean themselves up. We have to be careful not to allow them to change the narrative and slip into the mainstream,\u201d the crusader warned.\n\nTrumpmania has also brought attention to One People\u2019s Project. In the past year, Jenkins has made appearances on The Rachel Maddow Show and Today. A&E planned a show based on Jenkins confronting KKK members called Generation KKK and then Escaping the KKK, but the network canceled the show when it discovered that field producers had paid some interviewees.\n\nNone of this publicity has slowed Jenkins down in his pursuit of fascists. He has started an auxiliary site to One People\u2019s Project called IdaVoxx\u2014a news site named after civil rights activist and journalist Ida B. Wells. He is also scouring the social media accounts of white supremacist and alleged Times Square stabber James Jackson to see with whom he might be connected. If he finds anything, you can be sure that Daryle Lamont Jenkins will put them on blast.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSaid Jenkins: \u201cThere\u2019s a story about Rage Against the Machine singer Tom Morello, who once quit his job because he was reprimanded for telling someone they were racist. I\u2019m just like Tom\u2014if there\u2019s anyplace where I can\u2019t call a racist a racist, I don\u2019t want to be there!\u201d", "keywords": ["supremacists", "literally", "project", "media", "started", "hate", "groups", "nationalist", "kicking", "man", "white", "peoples", "taking", "jenkins", "names", "ass", "racist"], "polarity": -0.015062378290533633, "subjectivity": 0.4217832329482815},

And quite frankly, I\u2019m tired of laying my favorite brands down because the dumb folks in corporate communications elected to take a college course on the importance of Star Wars instead of African-American history.\n\n\n\nSo in an effort to prevent us all from giving up any more good body washes, hair products and cereals, I\u2019ve put together this list of Black Twitter-wrath-proof marketing practices for all those in need.\n\n1. Lay Down Our Edges\n\nThis one is pretty un-fuck-with-able. Forget the wardrobe and accessories\u2014what\u2019s sis\u2019 edges looking like? If a toothbrush wasn\u2019t involved in the making of the hairstyle, go back and try again (please don\u2019t try to understand this logic; just go with it). If a proper gel or styling agent cannot be located, be sure to check with the model. Nine times out of 10, she knew y\u2019all would get it wrong and likely has all necessary styling equipment in her bag, and/or has a homegirl around the corner who can be there in 15 minutes.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Racism Cannot Be Cured With a Kardashian\n\nI\u2019m sure the bronzer, large number of black men, enlarged lips, cornrows and build-a-booties would lead you to believe otherwise, but trust me on this one.\n\n\n\n3. All Models of Color Must Maintain Their Melanin Throughout the Making of the Advertisement\n\nIt\u2019s never a good look if a model or actor has to set aside his or her blackness for the sake of selling a product. FYI, I wasn\u2019t speaking figuratively; I said what I said. If your model must remove, lighten or disrobe their skin, you\u2019re probably going down the wrong creative path. Yes, Michael Jackson made it work for the \u201cBlack or White\u201d video, but you ain\u2019t Michael, and you dang sure ain\u2019t Tyra Banks killing \u2019em with your shoulders alongside the King of Pop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Don\u2019t Exclude Us\n\nI don\u2019t care if you\u2019re selling pumpkin-spice lattes with a side of cottage cheese out of the back of a Volkswagen Beetle at a Taylor Swift concert; somewhere, somehow, there\u2019s a black person who may be into it. In many ways, we\u2019re just like you, so don\u2019t leave us out. The last thing you want us to do is play a round of \u201cFind the Negro\u201d on your ad. It won\u2019t end well.\n\n5. Along Those Same Lines, Don\u2019t Assume We\u2019re Monolithic\n\nSo, you know how some white people like the color blue, while others prefer purple or yellow or orange? Well, it\u2019s exactly the same with black people. What works for some of us may not work for others (case in point: the age-old debate of grits vs. Cream of Wheat). One size does not fit all, and one marketing tactic does not work for the masses\u2014unless, of course, you\u2019re Beyonc\u00e9, for every living being shall get into formation accordingly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. Don\u2019t Try to Be Us\n\nWhen marketing to or for a black person, it\u2019s always preferred that you use an actual black person. Aesthetically, it\u2019s a lot more pleasing.\n\n7. We Give No Cares About Your Apology\n\nThe damage is done. The racism has been distributed widely across multiple platforms and we screenshot the hell out of it, so who cares what you have to say after the fact? I\u2019m sure most brands don\u2019t intentionally sit down and say, \u201cHow can we eff with the most historically disenfranchised and oppressed group of people of all time?\u201d But unfortunately that doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s impact vs. intent, and the former overshadows the latter. If you have to apologize, consider issuing an apology in the form of more diverse hires and inclusive marketing practices.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. When All Else Fails, Just Use the Honey Bunches of Oats Lady or Michelle Obama\n\nWe love the ish out of both of these women and would never question their judgment or discernment. If you\u2019ve got a friend in them, you\u2019ve got a friend in us.\n\n", "keywords": ["youre", "companies", "try", "marketing", "dont", "things", "racism", "person", "mind", "white", "work", "sure", "black"], "polarity": 0.05085418348130211, "subjectivity": 0.4227064837234329},

At the tender age of 32, this year has marked his sixth at the helm of the French luxury label, and it was his biggest to date. Since June, Rousteing has overseen the opening of a Beverly Hills, Calif., flagship boutique, a collaboration with Victoria\u2019s Secret for its annual runway show, the launch of now-sold-out designs for Beats by Dre and even costumes for the Paris Opera Ballet.\n\nBut one of Rousteing\u2019s lowest-profile collaborations is also one of his most accessible, and with Christmas gifts now bought and opened, \u2019tis the time in the season to treat yourself.\n\nIn Balmain\u2019s first venture into beauty, it recently teamed up with fellow French classic L\u2019Oreal Paris to create a Color Riche capsule collection of 12 of-the-moment matte shades, including a classic red aptly named \u201cDomination,\u201d a metallic army green labeled \u201cBalmain Instinct\u201d and a brown called \u201cPower\u201d that reminds us of the beloved \u201cBrazil Nut\u201d we rocked in high school. There\u2019s even an ultraviolet, perfectly on trend with Pantone\u2019s Color of the Year, called \u201cFreedom.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd while we\u2019ve yet to forget\u2014or forgive\u2014L\u2019Oreal Paris U.K.\u2019s recent dismissal of model Munroe Bergdorf over her very accurate comments about race, our fandom of Rousteing\u2014the only black person to head a major fashion house and the youngest creative director in Paris since Yves Saint Laurent\u2014definitely has us thinking twice. He, too, has been outspoken about racism, especially within the fashion industry, as he told Out magazine:\n\nLook at perfume campaigns. You never see black girls, and if you do, they use Photoshop so much that they almost look white. It\u2019s just wrong. People post on my Instagram that they are so happy to see black boys and black girls. I\u2019m happy that they see it and don\u2019t think that fashion belongs to white people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nL\u2019Oreal seems to have taken the hint, too, making sure to show even the palest shades in this collection on dark skin.\n\nAnd while you won\u2019t find this collection at your local drugstore, you will find it at the relatively bargain price of $14 per shade, even at luxury retailers like Barneys New York. The jury\u2019s still out on whether we\u2019ll bite\u2014especially since Fenty Beauty\u2019s 14-shade panorama of Mattemoiselle lipsticks dropped today at $18 each\u2014but at that price, we\u2019re tempted to buy one for every principle of Kwanzaa.", "keywords": ["budgetfriendly", "designer", "shades", "read", "collection", "rousteing", "fashion", "lips", "luxury", "season", "collab", "lor\u00e9al", "paris", "white", "instagram", "x", "black", "price", "balmain"], "polarity": 0.1687934220251293, "subjectivity": 0.49223823601872374},

Kennedy was an explosive FBI report about civil rights leader and icon Martin Luther King Jr. Even though the report had nothing to do with the JFK assassination, the Trump administration included the newly unsealed dossier in a trove of documents released Friday related to the Nov. 22, 1963, assassination of Kennedy in Dallas.\n\nWhat is the document?\n\nCommissioned by then-FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, the 20-page report is titled \u201cMartin Luther King, Jr.: A Current Analysis\u201d (pdf). It is dated March 12, 1968\u2014curiously, less than a month before King was shot and killed on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tenn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is in the report?\n\nLies.\n\nThe report is rife with falsehoods, speculation and disproven allegations about King, including his ties to communism and stories about secret orgies with prostitutes and white women.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy did they think King was a communist?\n\nBecause ... white people.\n\nYou know how today\u2019s incarnation of suspicious, fragile white-power brokers now label every anti-establishment organization a \u201cterrorist group\u201d? Well, in the 1950s and 1960s, the term \u201ccommunism\u201d shrank the collective Caucasian anus and furrowed white brows with fear, so every group of people who dared to speak truth to power was saddled with the label \u201cMarxist\u201d or \u201ccommunist.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpecifically, the report ties King\u2019s Southern Christian Leadership Conference to the Communist Party USA, a small, marginalized group with no influence by 1960. The details of the document allege that King and the SCLC were heavily influenced by Stanley Levinson, a lawyer and businessman who financed the party for years.\n\nThe dossier tries to tie King to the Communist Party through Levinson even though Levinson had left the party years before he met King. It insists that King\u2019s Poor People\u2019s Campaign was related to a secret communist agenda without offering any solid evidence.\n\nWas King a communist?\n\nDidn\u2019t I just say the report was filled with lies? Are you even paying attention?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead of explaining it to you, I\u2019ll just tell you what King told his trusted adviser Bayard Rustin in 1965 as King was crafting a statement announcing the unity of the civil rights organizations:\n\nThere are things I wanted to say renouncing communism in theory, but they would not go along with it. We wanted to say that it was an alien philosophy contrary to us, but they wouldn\u2019t go along with it.\n\nPart of the FBI\u2019s allegations of communism is fueled by King\u2019s stance against the Vietnam War, which some translated as support for the commuinist Viet Cong. Some of it is tied to the fact that King\u2019s Poor People\u2019s Campaign was seen by some melanin-impaired capitalists as un-American. King\u2019s strategy of peaceful resistance is also closely affiliated with Karl Marx\u2019s belief in the possibility of achieving equality through peaceful revolution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is no doubt that there were communists affiliated with the civil rights movement. Some of them were prominent supporters, but that does not mean that King or the entire movement for equality was a communist plot.\n\nSome of the people reading this article hold unspeakably heinous beliefs, like putting sugar on grits. This publication even employs people who commit un-American acts like giving trick-or-treaters candy corn for Halloween or putting ketchup in the refrigerator. Corey Townsend, The Root\u2019s social media editor, even confessed that he likes pumpkin-spice-related foods.\n\nBut none of these terrible acts means that everyone here at The Root is an evil, demented terrorist of taste buds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut what about the sex orgies?\n\nJust say \u201corgies\u201d; the \u201csex\u201d part is understood. There aren\u2019t any other kinds of orgies, although I have joined friends at a certain Atlanta restaurant for what can only be described as a \u201clemon-pepper-wing orgy.\u201d\n\nAccording to the analysis from the FBI, King\u2019s associates held a workshop in 1968 in Miami to train a minister. The report states that some in attendance were disgusted with the whiskey drinking, homosexuality and fornication at the conference, including a sex show with prostitutes who engaged in activities \u201cdeviating from the normal sex acts.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe report does not say that King was present at this event but details affairs by King, including one with singer Joan Baez and an alleged love child with the wife of a prominent Los Angeles dentist. The single source for this information is a \u201cresponsible\u201d informant \u201cin a position to know.\u201d\n\nWhy does any of this matter?\n\nAgain, because ... white people.\n\nNone of this salacious detail negates the fact that King was fighting for the freedom or equality of black people. It does not dismiss the reality of Jim Crow, segregation, voter suppression, unequal housing, inferior education, state-sponsored terrorism or the unconstitutional, government-backed treatment of black people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe only reasonable explanation for any of this is that it was an attempt to discredit MLK and, by proxy, the entire civil rights movement.\n\nHow did they use this information?\n\nHoover and the FBI used it in a number of ways. The FBI\u2019s Counterintelligence Program, or COINTELPRO, tried to destroy the civil rights movement for years by casting it as a subversive, communist-backed agenda. The details in this report were ammunition for much of that FBI agenda. In November 1964, the FBI sent a letter to King telling him that it was aware of his extramarital affairs. The bureau threatened to release this information if King didn\u2019t commit suicide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThank God J. Edgar Hoover is gone. Today\u2019s FBI would never do this again, right?\n\nCould you do me a favor and hold my lemon-pepper wing while I double over in laughter?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJeff Sessions, the attorney general who controls the FBI, is known for calling the NAACP \u201cun-American\u201d and \u201ccommunist-inspired.\u201d A few months after he took office, an FBI report leaked that characterized the threat from \u201cblack identity extremists\u201d as the new terrorist threat. Even the nonviolent group Black Lives Matter is often called a \u201cterrorist organization\u201d by members on the conservative side of the aisle.\n\nIf you believe that the day has passed when anyone concerned with justice or equality could be painted by right-wing zealots as evil, anti-American villains, just remember to turn on your television around 1 o\u2019clock on a Sunday afternoon and watch the Caucasian crowd members boo NFL players for kneeling quietly during the national anthem, or read one of the many right-wing rags\u2019 desperate attempts to tie former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick to communism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe FBI dossier proves that Martin Luther King Jr. was the victim of a coordinated, government-funded effort to suppress the civil rights movement. President Donald Trump\u2019s release of the documents provides additional fuel for those who seek to denigrate anything black and outspoken because their history of complicity gives them the heebie-jeebies. Because they are too willing to believe that a civil rights legend was a communist and sexual deviant, but not that their dear, pumpkin-colored, pussy-grabbing president is a sexual assaulter. Because that would mean that they were on the wrong side of history for more than a quadruple century.\n\n\n\nBecause ... white people.\n\nRead more at the Washington Post.", "keywords": ["luther", "file", "civil", "wanted", "released", "say", "kings", "know", "communist", "fbi", "rights", "martin", "liefilled", "king", "jr", "white", "trump", "report", "black"], "polarity": -0.02562157287157288, "subjectivity": 0.4564069264069264},

Artist Kehinde Wiley portrays the former president as concerned, probing, and calm, with just the faintest hint of a smirk playing across his lips; he is settled within a radiant, repeating wall of foliage, faintly obscured where his shoes nestle into the overgrowth. As presidential portraits go, it\u2019s bold, opinionated, and utterly modern. Alongside Amy Sherald\u2019s painting of Michelle Obama, it also happens to be the first commission to a black artist from the National Portrait Gallery.\n\n\n\nAccordingly, Sean Hannity does not like it. In point of fact, he thinks there is \u201csecret sperm\u201d on the painting, and it frightens him. This is not a euphemism; he thinks that Wiley painted jizz onto Obama\u2019s face. In a since-deleted post entitled \u201cPORTRAIT PERVERSION\u201d published today on his blog, an author mysteriously dubbed \u201cHannity Staff\u201d writes:\n\nControversy surrounding Kehinde Wiley\u2019s wildly non-traditional portrait of the Commander-in-Chief broke out within minutes of its unveiling; with industry insiders claiming the artist secretly inserted his trademark technique -concealing images of sperm within his paintings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you\u2019re hoping for more explanation than that, you will not find it in the article, which is still available to read via cache. It moves on from there to note that the artist once sardonically used the phrase \u201ckill whitey\u201d in a New York magazine profile, which at least has the virtue of being true, unlike the claim that he put sperm in his painting of Barack Obama, which is objectively not true.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look, just to be sure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYep, definitely just a person\u2019s face. You\u2019d think Sean Hannity would be the expert on aggressive sexual deviancy, given that he spent most of his career working for disgraced sexual predator Roger Ailes and alongside disgraced (alleged) sexual predator Bill O\u2019Reilly.\n\nUnfortunately, this is what happens when you take news tips from 4chan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat would explain why Hannity pulled the article, as well as the tweet endorsing said article almost immediately after issuing it.

Considering the offended party\u2019s unusually high level of self-importance, it\u2019s unsurprising that a serious newsman made a pretend one lose it over criticism.\n\n\n\nEven so, though Koppel may have been correct in his assessment of Hannity and the damage that political opinion in news media is capable of, the segment itself was rooted in a false equivalence with respect to political opinion shows. Koppel, like many, continues to operate from the unfortunate space that all opinion shows are equal. However, the segment compares sound bites from John Oliver, who hosts a late-night cable political comedy show, and Michael Savage, a conservative radio host who fancies himself an activist\u2014and in doing so, it is helping to perpetuate a false dichotomy.\n\nOliver is a comedian who opines on politics, but his commentary is often well researched and, by and large, factual. The same goes for Samantha Bee and Trevor Noah. Those are folks whose first job is to be funny, not necessarily to inform. Nonetheless, a decade ago, a study by Pew Research highlighted that viewers of Comedy Central\u2019s The Daily Show (then hosted by Jon Stewart) and The Colbert Report held the \u201chighest knowledge of national and international affairs while Fox News viewers rank nearly dead last.\u201d So even if, seven years later, a separate Pew Research study noted that many people continued to identify those shows as legitimate news sources, other studies have shown that people do actually learn something.\n\nWhat are people learning from Tomi Lahren or Rush Limbaugh other than that many people miss the days of water fountains with access based on skin pigmentation?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther studies have shown that outlets such as Fox News and MSNBC have a negative impact on people\u2019s knowledge of current events, but I question anyone who would argue that Rachel Maddow is like Tucker Carlson, that Chris Hayes is anywhere near Bill O\u2019Reilly or that Joy-Ann Reid mirrors Megan Kelly in any way. The only person on Fox News worth listening to in terms of actual news is Shepard Smith. That doesn\u2019t mean Fox\u2019s opinion hosts are incapable of educating their viewers while sharing their respective ideology, but they opt not to.\n\nIt\u2019s not so much that opinion programming on news networks is the problem as it is that we are bombarded with uninformed opinions\u2014primarily because of a conservative media that\u2019s much more invested in playing into the racial and gender biases of its viewership than in educating them. When it comes to problems with news media, cries that it\u2019s too opinionated read as an oversimplification.\n\nWhat\u2019s MSNBC\u2019s problem? It could use far more color and a bit more youth. Oh, and in the case of the 6 p.m. hour on its Monday-to-Friday lineup, stop trying to make fetch happen with Greta Van Susteren. Simply chasing after old Fox News watchers isn\u2019t going to cut it. Soon enough, NBC will learn that with Kelly. Shoutout to Tamron Hall.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for Fox News, well, drown that network and hand only Smith a life raft. That station is nothing but a dedication to the white establishment and willful ignorance. It is insulting to compare its mythology-peddling with people who bother to actually know about a given issue before commenting on it.\n\nNow, with CNN ... first, join me in prayer.\n\nObviously, not everyone is guilty of this, but the network (along with Fox News, whom it clearly jacked this from) has this incessant need to air hours upon hours of verbal jousting and call it news. That\u2019s actually infotainment, and nothing can be gleaned from that other than catharsis for those who need to see someone they don\u2019t agree with be yelled out. On that front, I agree with news veterans like Tom Brokaw who have rallied against the \u201cvicious\u201d tones flooding the news stations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAngela Rye is equal parts intelligent and talented, but subjecting her to former Rep. Joe Walsh seems wrong. Walsh is a racist who just makes up nonsense online to get on television and blab out a bunch of other nonsense. Koppel said this to Hannity, but it applies to Walsh, too, although not Rye: \u201cYou have attracted people who have determined that ideology is more important than facts.\u201d\n\nRye and Walsh are not on an equal footing.\n\nI\u2019m all for making the news media better and less intolerable to watch, but it\u2019s tiresome to continue hearing people make the \u201cboth sides do it\u201d argument in the name of objectivity. Objectivity is often a figment of people\u2019s imaginations. News anchors are not supposed to share their opinions, but they are supposed to tell the truth. Opinion anchors should be free to share their line of thinking, but it ought to come from a place rooted in facts. Unless people free the sensible conservatives locked in a closet somewhere and book them over the ones who simply want to hoot and holler for the sake of securing a cushy contract, stop equating each side.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGet rid of the lying dummies, and Americans would be far less dumb and uninformed.

On the other hand, black fashion designers? They are some of the other hidden figures on the cultural landscape.\n\nThat\u2019s what makes \"Black Fashion Designers,\" the exhibit that runs until May 16 at the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City, so vital and important.\n\nFor decades, black designers have been at the forefront of fashion despite facing all the challenges that daunt any new businessperson, as well as resisting the pigeonholing that comes from not being a member of the dominant demographic.\n\nYet, as the exhibit shows, there\u2019s an extraordinary range of aesthetic splendor and unique accomplishment. For instance, the wedding gown of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis was designed by Ann Lowe, an African-American designer. The iconic Playboy Bunny uniform was designed by Zelda Wynn, also a black designer. Laura Smalls, one of many Afro-Diasporic designers championed by Michelle Obama, designed the red-and-white-print dress the first lady wore in July for her appearance in \"Carpool Karaoke.\"\n\nIn all, the exhibit features 75 outfits from 60 designers, plus videos of discussions headed by Washington Post fashion editor Robin Givhan and Vogue contributing editor Andr\u00e9 Leon Talley.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack designers rose to prominence in the \u201940s and have fought for recognition and respect from the industry for more than 70 years. The exhibit details their struggles and those of black models, but the best part is the wide range of style.\n\nSome designers draw on their African heritage, abstracting kente cloth or scarification. Others offer a bold, futuristic outlook. All of the clothing displayed shows that the same extraordinary power found on the streets where we live is also on display on the runway and in the ateliers where high fashion is home.\n\nHere are several designers who stand out in the exhibit.\n\n\n\nAnn Lowe\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLowe (1898-1981), who designed the ivory silk taffeta wedding dress for Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis\u2019 marriage to John F. Kennedy, grew up in Alabama, the daughter and granddaughter of women who worked as seamstresses but also designed clothing.\n\nWhen Lowe was 16, her mother died while working on a series of ball gowns for Alabama\u2019s first lady, Elizabeth Kirkman. Lowe stepped in and completed the project, then attended a segregated design school. She settled in Tampa, Fla., and opened a boutique called Annie Cohen.\n\nShe later moved to New York City, where she did commissions for leading retailers and designed the Oscar gown that Olivia de Havilland wore to accept the award for To Each His Own in 1946. Lowe later opened a boutique in New York City's Manhattan, designing for wealthy clientele. The Saturday Evening Post called her \u201csociety\u2019s best-kept secret.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPatrick Kelly\n\nIn a brief amount of time, Kelly (1954-1990) took the fashion world by storm. He grew up in Vicksburg Miss., and fell in love with fashion both via the creativity of his relatives and from the magazines that his grandmother, a domestic, brought home from work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe moved to Atlanta, where he designed the windows for the Yves Saint Laurent boutique. He then moved to Paris and quickly went from selling dresses on the street to presenting his own line of clothing. His clients included Cicely Tyson, Bette Davis and Grace Jones.\n\n\n\nDuro Olowu\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNigerian-born and London-based, Olowu came to fashion after starting a career as a lawyer. His work is renowned for mixing African and American iconography. Olowu, the husband of Studio Museum Director Thelma Golden, regularly presents during Fashion Week and has done collections for J.C. Penney.\n\nHe was one of four designers chosen by Michelle Obama to decorate the White House for Christmas in 2015, and he curates the prestigious London exhibit \u201cMaking and Unmaking.\u201d He told the New York Times that he collects fabric the way some people collect Rolexes.\n\n\n\nEric Gaskins\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGaskins was born in Germany and grew up in New York City, where he now lives. He has said that his aim is to make clothing that is essential and without artifice and contrivance. He launched his own line in 1987, and his clothes have appeared on the covers of Harper\u2019s Bazaar, Vanity Fair and Glamour.\n\nHis clients include Jennifer Lopez, Salma Hayek, Mariah Carey and Jada Pinkett Smith. In the \u201900s, he scandalized the fashion world as one of the anonymous writers behind the tell-all blog the Emperor\u2019s Old Clothes.\n\n\n\nAndre Walker\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWalker, based in Brooklyn, N.Y., got his start at an early age. He staged his first runway show at the New York City nightclub Oasis when he was only 15 years old.\n\nHe worked in Paris in the \u201990s, and his idea of the pant skirt was the inspiration for Jean-Paul Gaultier\u2019s works in a similar vein. Patricia Field described him as \u201cthe future of the new designers.\u201d After a few years out of the spotlight when he was consulting for Marc Jacobs, he has returned with a Dover Street Market line of clothes that aim for what W magazine called \u201cretail-friendly yet lofty.\u201d\n\n\n\nAisha Obuobi\n\nAdvertisement\n\nObuobi, the designer behind the company Christie Brown, is widely considered one of the leading fashion designers in Africa.

The \u201cFight Racism, Raise Pay\u201d protests, planned for more than two-dozen cities from Atlanta to Milwaukee to Las Vegas, come as working Americans face an onslaught of attacks on their right to join together for higher pay and confront racist policies from the White House down to local police departments.

Virginia Supreme Court decision in 1967 that struck down state laws banning interracial marriage.\n\nHolmes calls the children of interracial marriage born between 1960 and 1985 \u201cthe Loving Generation,\u201d though where I\u2019m from, we just call us mixed. Or black. Mostly black. Or \u201cYou know you black, right?\u201d\n\n\n\nAnyway, I have quite a few qualms about the piece, especially as a mixed person who identifies as black whose picture is included in the actual op-ed\u2014which, petty or not, makes me feel as if I co-signed the opinions and perspective. I did not. All of us who are pictured in the op-ed are also part of a supplement to the documentary series. I can\u2019t speak for anybody else involved, but I took issue with much of the op-ed because our experiences as mixed people are varied in a way that the piece mutes.\n\n1. I HATE the title. \u201cBlack With (Some) White Privilege\u201d conjures up that time Very Smart Brotha\u2019s own Damon Young wrote \u201cStraight Black Men Are the White People of Black People..\u201d I got why folks hated that title then (even if I agreed in principle with his argument), and I hate this even more. Damon\u2019s piece stated that male privilege exists and that black males have some privilege by virtue of being male. THIS piece alleges that mixed kids exercise some sort of white privilege by virtue of having a white parent. I think this entire premise is flawed; it is ENTIRELY circumstantial. She\u2019s somehow conflating colorism with proximity to whiteness, and they\u2019re two entirely different things.\n\nYou can be light-skinned with two black parents and receive the same benefits from lightness as a person who is mixed. And what if you\u2019re a dark-skinned mixed person\u2014somebody whose background is entirely impossible to tell from skin tone\u2014and receive no \u201cbenefits\u201d? Then what? Do you still have some white privilege because of your white parent? Like, do they need to show up to prove it? Maybe you just can\u2019t use it in person, only on paper?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. I don\u2019t like this idea that there was some overarching political decision that so many black-and-white couples made after the Supreme Court decision to somehow stick it (no pun intended) to white supremacy by creating mixed children. While I\u2019m sure that some white folks absolutely rebelled in the form of their bedroom decisions, and some black folks took that opportunity, do we really believe that people are thinking about a Supreme Court decision when they meet and go through life together? I doubt it. If there\u2019s any proximity argument, I think this is where it exists. Most of these relationships\u2014whether married or not\u2014were born of desire, love and actual proximity.\n\n3. This passage:\n\nHow does having one white parent change that \u201ctwice as good\u201d calculation? Data on biracial people is tricky because it relies on self-reported identity. But my early inquiries into the Loving Generation showed that people with one black-identified and one white-identified parent seem to be disproportionately represented among black leaders and luminaries. Are our achievements impossible to separate from the benefits that, in this country, have always come with whiteness?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou know how you have an idea, then you find ideas to support it even if holes can be shot through it? So there are more mixed people than you\u2019d expect in the \u201cleaders and luminaries\u201d category. OK. Holmes points out several at the beginning of the piece, namely actors, politicos, entertainers, athletes, etc.\n\nFor some, in particular entertainers and politicos, it would be asinine to suggest that their skin tone\u2014folks like Alicia Keys, Mariah Carey and Halle Berry\u2014doesn\u2019t play a role in their success; their being mixed also contributed to their skin tone, of course. Carey may be an outlier because of her once-in-a-lifetime talent (the same with Derek Jeter and Jason Kidd, also name-checked in the article). But proximity to whiteness didn\u2019t help them out as much as their complexion. And how do you reconcile that with folks like Beyonc\u00e9 and Rihanna (and, hell, Muhammad Ali) who are (or was) light-skinned with two black parents? Are they just otherworldly talents? What about their white proximity?\n\n4. Then this passage:\n\nSometimes, when I looked at the list I had made, it seemed entirely possible that our direct connection to whiteness \u2014 through immediate and extended family \u2014 had contributed to a certain familiarity with, and therefore accessibility to, the white norms, traditions and power structures that so many of us depend on for opportunity and success. The common denominator in the Loving Generation wasn\u2019t necessarily so much white proximity as white acceptance and, in many cases, familial love and close connection to white people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOK, so it\u2019s not proximity, it\u2019s access to white people that begets other access to white people and the white power structure. I\u2019m connected to white people, so other white folks can tell and thus make an easier pathway toward success. Which, again, works if you can tell that a person is mixed and thus make a conscious decision because of it.\n\nWhat about the rest of us who aren\u2019t that easily discernible as mixed? What about our success? Not all heroes wear capes, and not all mixed people look like Meghan Markle. Or Vanessa Williams. Some of us actually aren\u2019t that noticeable and are considered light-skinned black folks by society writ large until we show up with or tell you we have a white parent. Doors don\u2019t open at that point either, by the way.\n\n5. And this:\n\nIt\u2019s likely, for example, that Barack Obama was able to imagine himself as president not just because he saw himself reflected in the white people around him, but because they saw themselves reflected in him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI do agree that President Barack Obama\u2019s proximity to whiteness absolutely helped shape his worldview, and being around white people who loved him unequivocally was a boon for him. Did that make him believe he could be the first black president? Eh. My black parents made me believe that I could, too. But being president seems like a terrible job, so I\u2019ve never had the smallest of inklings to want to go down that road. Now, I suppose the question is, did I actually think that I could? Whereas maybe Obama always believed it with his whole heart? That\u2019s a legit question.\n\n6. Holy mother of God:\n\nI knew, even as a young adult, that I moved among and around white people with relative ease, in a way that my blackness \u2014 and my own perception and self-consciousness of it \u2014 wasn\u2019t at the foreground. What I didn\u2019t know is whether that had something, or everything, to do with what I\u2019d accomplished.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m mixed\u2014my mother is a white woman\u2014and I have never moved around white people with relative ease, though I\u2019m not entirely sure what that means, either. In fact, short of my white mother, grandmother and stepfather, I am rarely around whiteness. I live in predominantly black cities and went to an HBCU and could literally put \u201cprofessional black person\u201d on my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 without a hint of comedy. I think most folks would call me successful, so how would we qualify that success? And what about dark-skinned black people who move with ease around white people?\n\n7. For heaven\u2019s sake:\n\nTurns out, I was not alone. Erin Cloud, a public defender in the South Bronx, has similar concerns. \u201cAt my job, there\u2019s actually a lot of biracial people that are in more leadership opportunities, and I think about that. I\u2019m like, \u2018Well, is that because there\u2019s something about their whiteness and our whiteness that is giving us space to communicate and that\u2019s why we\u2019re getting promotions and why we\u2019re moving forward?\u201d she said. \u201cI am a black woman. I see myself as a black woman, but I also have to be honest. I love my mother. I can\u2019t say for many of my black friends that they deeply, intimately, without any bounds love a white person.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI love my mother, who is white. We do nothing but argue and have nothing in common. I\u2019m starting to wonder if I\u2019m just an exception to this whole mixed life that others manage to live.\n\n8. Yep:\n\nThe writer and activist Rebecca Walker (1969) told \u201cThe Loving Generation\u201d director Lacey Schwartz last month that she believes biracial and mixed-race fluidity has led to significant cultural and political contributions. \u201cOur ability to see things from so many different perspectives has really been a boon for this culture,\u201d she said. She wonders, however, what the return is \u2014 that is, where do we go from here?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMixed-race fluidity? What is that? Is that a thing? (It\u2019s not.) I\u2019m mixed and I view life through a very, very black-perspective lens. Because that\u2019s my life; I\u2019m black. How do you even see things with a white perspective? What is that? I\u2019m REALLY asking. \u201cMixed-race fluidity\u201d implies that you have some choices and can move easily between worlds. I don\u2019t care to do that, but in my experiences, that\u2019s not a thing. Being mixed just means that you don\u2019t choose black, not that you are somehow white. Because that\u2019s not a choice you actually have outside of the confines of your own mind and friends who let you cook.\n\n9. It goes on, but that\u2019s my larger issue with this piece: You can\u2019t decide that colorism isn\u2019t at the heart of whatever \u201cprivilege\u201d is being attributed to whiteness. Mixed people come in so many different shades that you can\u2019t always tell. Sure, some mixed folks are lighter and thus, perhaps, benefit in ways that other mixed folks may not, but that\u2019s not because they\u2019re mixed; it\u2019s because they\u2019re light-skinned.\n\nWhat about me? I\u2019m light-skinned, but I seriously doubt that there\u2019s some significant benefit I\u2019ve received, even though I\u2019d wager that I have received some by virtue of my less-than-threatening visage. Saying that black folks receive white privilege is problematic because it entirely DISCOUNTS light-skinned points, something we joke about in the black community that is a real thing. You don\u2019t need to be half-white for that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. The most I\u2019ve ever discussed being \u201cmixed\u201d has been over the past six months. My life has been a largely black one since I was a child. I was raised in a black household, with some summers spent with my white mom in quasi-rural Michigan, where I was always aware of my blackness. Articles such as this push me further into the belief that my parents really did me a solid by not giving me a choice or considering me to be mixed in order to make sure I honored both of my parents. I am able to do so without trying to claim some racial connection that white people have spent centuries trying to remove from me.\n\nPlus, why would I want that? I can love my white mother and be black. But more important, to me, it\u2019s REALLY OK to be black. I don\u2019t need to focus on the white proximity or the adjacency or the gaze. I can be equally successful as a black person who fully embraces that part of myself. There\u2019s a reason I never think about whether my being mixed is partially responsible for my success\u2014I don\u2019t make it a thing. I don\u2019t allow others to focus on it. It\u2019s why I not only get to go to the cookout, but I can also bring macaroni and cheese.\n\nI can acknowledge that I receive some benefits because I\u2019m light-skinned\u2014because I am. I also have the wherewithal to acknowledge that my black parents (and sometimes, ironically, my white mother) raised a black man who is comfortable with his accomplishments, without also feeling as if the whiteness in my veins that nobody knows exists is the reason for those accomplishments. That\u2019s my beef with the piece and its centering so much whiteness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause it really is OK to black.", "keywords": ["thoughts", "im", "dont", "folks", "holmes", "white", "thats", "privilege", "oped", "york", "black", "mixed", "whiteness", "proximity", "anna", "times"], "polarity": 0.08471439626681555, "subjectivity": 0.38245688451333604},

New York-based artist Kehinde Wiley \u2014 known for reimagining traditional Western art and putting African Americans both anonymous and famous as the focus \u2014 was selected to bring the former POTUS\u2019 image on to canvas. Baltimore-based artist Amy Sherald brought FLOTUS to life using oil on linen using a more modern touch, using her signature gray palette.\n\nThis moment, with black artists celebrating black accomplishments, was lost on no one, least of all the Obamas, who noted that they were the first in their families to sit for a portrait.\n\n\u201cI am humbled, I am honored, I am proud. I am so incredibly grateful to all the people who came before me in this journey. The folks who built the foundation upon which I stand,\u201d Michelle Obama told the audience who came to celebrate the big moment. \u201cI am also thinking about all the young people, particularly girls and girls of color, who in years ahead will come to this place and they will look up and see an image of someone who looks like them hanging on the wall of this great American institution.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI know the kind of impact that will have on their lives, because I was one of those girls,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd when I think about those future generations and generations past, I think again, wow. What an incredible journey we are on together in this country.\u201d\n\nIn true Michelle Obama fashion, the first lady in her choice of artist, and in her choice of dress, chose to share her spotlight with rising stars. The dress featured in the portrait was designed by Michelle Smith\u2019s label Milly, and even that had extreme significance, with Sherald sharing how the geometric patterns reminded her of the quilts of Gee\u2019s Bend, a small, remote, black community in Alabama known for its quilt masterpieces.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe former FLOTUS portrait captures her seated, with one hand tucked under her chin as she stares out at those surveying her. Her expression cool, confident, unflinching.\n\n\u201cThe act of Michelle Obama being her authentic self became a profound statement that engaged all of us, because what you represent to this country is an ideal, a human being with integrity, intellect, confidence and compassion,\u201d Sherald, the winner of the 2016 Outwin Boochever Portrait Competition, a rising star in the art world, told the audience.\n\nThe former President, on the other hand, was his usual charming self (please come back) , joking as he surveyed his colorful and vibrant portrait.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cKehinde relative to Amy was working at a disadvantage because his subject was less becoming,\u201d he quipped. \u201cNot as fly.\u201d\n\n\u201cI tried to negotiate less grey hair and Kehinde\u2019s artistic integrity would not allow him to do what I asked. I tried to negotiate smaller ears, struck out on that as well,\u201d the former president said as the audience chuckled.\n\nBarack Obama was painted sitting on a wooden chair among dense foliage with pops of colorful flowers. That was a purposeful touch by artist Wiley, who noted that some of the flowers carry special meaning to the president and his journey through life. The chrysanthemums give a nod to Chicago, the jasmine evokes Hawaii, where the President grew up, and of course the African blue lilies give nod to his Kenyan heritage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe ability to be the first African American to paint the first African American President of the United States; it doesn\u2019t get any better than that,\u201d Wiley said. \u201cI was humbled by this invitation.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr President I thank you for giving me a chance, and I thank you for giving this nation a chance to experience your splendor on a global scale,\u201d the artist added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe newest additions to the gallery will be on view to the public beginning Feb. 13.", "keywords": ["official", "moment", "african", "michelle", "president", "using", "history", "shining", "unveiling", "obama", "artist", "wiley", "black", "portrait", "barack", "obamas", "told"], "polarity": 0.15363906926406928, "subjectivity": 0.39663419913419906},

Like, I\u2019m sure we all could go on and on about how terrible this year truly was to each and every last one of us. Still, the year had some high points, which we pointed out earlier this week, but in the spirit of balance and equilibrium (it took me all that I had to not make a Star Wars crack, since I finally went to go see The Last Jedi), I think reflection on the super, terrible year that was 2017 is necessary, even if that means reflecting on its low points for us as a people.\n\n\n\nGIF\n\nSo, without further ado, I present to you the top 10 disappointing moments (in no particular order) black people experienced in the year 2017:\n\n\n\n1. White People\n\nThis ... is a given. In 2017, perhaps the greatest moments of discomfort, borderline instability and downright asininity experienced by our large and expansive community could be most certainly traced back to Chet and them.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom President Cheeto Dandruff yucking it up in the White House and threatening to start a war every time he tweeted with his sausage fingers to white people trying to install a whole (alleged) child molester in another political office in Alabama to chanting about \u201cwhite lives\u201d in Charlottesville, Va., with their busted tiki torches, white folx showed no sign of waking the fuck up and instead continued to plead that we save them from themselves.\n\n2. The Atlanta Falcons Giving Up a 25-Point Lead in the Super Bowl\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Jan. 22, 2017, it was announced that the Atlanta Falcons would face off against the New England Patriots in Super Bowl 51. And after President Radioactive Cheeto Dust was elected to office at the conclusion of 2016, it became quite clear that this aforementioned game was about to become an unintentional, extended metaphor for that year.\n\nIndeed, it was the ultrablack, ultralit Falcons versus Trump\u2019s America the New England Patriots and Tom \u201cTrump Is My Boi\u201d Brady. And for a minute, during that very game, it looked as if the Falcons were gonna take the win, with a 25-point lead to boot.\n\n... and then they blew that lead to lose to Trump\u2019s America the Patriots by six points.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was one of the most embarrassing Ls we took this year, and to be quite honest, I\u2019ll never get over it.\n\n3. The Cancellation of Underground\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am honestly still too angry to describe how unjust it was that Underground was canceled but shows like, oh, I don\u2019t know, Megyn Kelly Today are still chilling on the air.\n\nIt was an unnecessary loss of a show that focused on aspects of black liberation during slavery rather than the kind of torture porn that Hollywood is used to peddling. The cancellation was especially hard to swallow when it was announced that HBO had its own alternate-universe slavery fan fiction in development (thankfully, that looks like it\u2019s no longer happening).\n\nHowever, despite its unjust cancellation, the search for a new home network for Underground continues.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Alexandra Shipp, Tinashe and Colorism\n\nAdvertisement\n\nColorism. It is a subset of oppression that precedes your existence and mine. And yet, to this day, black people can\u2019t seem to get ourselves together when it comes to this topic. Such was the case this year as well.\n\nTinashe was the earliest example as she implied that being light-skinned had hurt her odds of succeeding in the music industry, even though she had not done anything remarkable as of late, and she simultaneously failed to call out the over-saturation of stars who look like her in the business, thereby causing her lamentations to fall on deaf ears.\n\nAlexandra Shipp was just another example of this when, a couple of weeks ago, the actress claimed that black people had been the most racist to her for her entire life. This was after a Storm superfan came into her Twitter mentions about hoping that Marvel would cast a dark-skinned Storm for a hypothetical X-Men franchise reboot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot everyone agreed with how the fan approached the ever present problem of characters like Storm being portrayed by light-skinned actresses, but I think most of us can agree that the actress (a word I use lightly) took the conversation in a direction that didn\u2019t even make any damn sense.\n\nAnd in 2017, we should be able to do better.\n\n5. Russell Simmons Proved How Tight Sexual Predators Can Be\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2017 was a shit year, no doubt, but it also proved to be, for the most part, a year of reckoning for men who had done some dirt in the dark. The domino effect started with Harvey Weinstein, and folks are still out here in these streets being rightfully exposed. And Russell Simmons was among those in the carnage.\n\nAfter Terry Crews came forward about being sexually assaulted by WME\u2019s Adam Venit (a moment that was very, very important for male survivors), Crews also was very candid about the folx who had tried to silence him and, in turn, exposed Simmons\u2019 damning email to Crews in which he attempted to tell Crews to \u201clet it go.\u201d It was a disgusting development, and no one was surprised when Simmons was subsequently accused of sexual assault, too. However, folx who were familiar with Simmons\u2019 Rush Card scams and Kimora Lee\u2019s stories about him knew that this was part of an already trifling pattern of behavior.\n\n6. The Fallout from VerySmartBrothas\u2019 \u201cStraight Black Men Are the White People of Black People\u201d Piece\n\nThe moment I saw the headline \u201cStraight Black Men Are the White People of Black People\u201d come across my timeline, I knew that all hell was about to break loose.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGIF\n\nI\u2019m not gonna get into the specifics of the piece (mostly because you can read it here), but Damon Young\u2019s article got at a point that cisgender straight men had been ignoring for a long time: that they are the most privileged in our community.\n\nOf course, it wasn\u2019t as easy to refute coming from a fellow cis, straight black man, so many of Young\u2019s detractors, in turn, went after prominent black women who had shared the article\u2014the chief example being Jemele Hill, who they had all fake supported weeks prior. It was an ever present example of the kind of hypocritical bullshit black women are confronted with every damn day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. Time: The Kalief Browder Story Reminds Us of Everyone We\u2019ve Lost to an Unjust Justice System\n\nOn Oct. 6, 2016, it was announced that Jay-Z and his team were putting together a documentary about the life, times, and completely unnecessary and avoidable death of Kalief Browder. The documentary finally debuted this year, and while it was something we sorely needed, it was also a painful reminder of all the black people we had lost thus far to an unjust \u201cjustice system.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt also served as a harrowing admonisher of the effects that racism and white supremacy can have on our bodies and minds, too, which we were reminded of after his mother\u2019s (Venida Browder) untimely death last year and Erica Garner\u2019s recent hospitalization.\n\n8. Black Transgender Model Munroe Bergdorf Called Out Racism and Was Fired by L\u2019Oreal\n\nIn a year full of watershed moments when women snatched back the mic from a society that constantly seeks to silence us, it was particularly angering when Munroe Bergdorf did just that and was punished for it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndeed, L\u2019Oreal was all for profiting off her image as a black trans woman and her ties to those respective communities, but as soon as she attempted to speak on behalf of them, L\u2019Oreal was like, \u201cNah.\u201d Combine this with instances like Jemele Hill\u2019s, and it\u2019s another example of these corporations wanting \u201cdiversity\u201d without teeth. Performative nonsense.\n\n9. That Racist Dove Commercial\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet\u2019s be real. Since the goal of any sensible corporation or business is to make a boatload of cold, hard, stinking cash (hello, capitalism), no one is expecting them to be super-\u201cwoke,\u201d empathetic entities.\n\nHowever.\n\nIn the spirit of getting as much money as fucking possible, you would think they could at least appeal to the most common denominator of their demographics and have people on deck to make sure they are not racially insulting a huge chunk of their base.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou\u2019d think.\n\nBut this year, that was not the case with Dove. Dove made it excruciatingly obvious that it has no black people in its public relations/marketing department when it released a commercial that showed a dark-skinned black woman taking off a brown shirt and morphing into a white woman.\n\nTo be forthcoming, it wasn\u2019t the only beauty company with a racist ad this year. Nivea joined in on the fun by putting out its \u201cWhite Is Purity\u201d ad and got the social media flogging it deserved. Yet Dove\u2019s ad happened to be a bit more biting because black people are a huge piece of its base and because there\u2019s something very visceral about seeing a black woman morphing into a white woman in an ad that is not Michael Jackson\u2019s \u201cBlack or White\u201d video\u2014especially considering the history of racist soap advertisements in America and abroad.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. Dave Chappelle\u2019s Return\n\n\n\nIn March 2017, after years of being off the air and mostly out of the limelight, Dave Chappelle prepared for what looked to be a roaringly victorious return to television.\n\nThis was something black folx had been anticipating and cheering on for a long time. After watching Chappelle walk away from a $50 million contract and refuse to be Comedy Central\u2019s dancing monkey (and thereby get branded \u201cunstable\u201d because of it), we were all excited for him to stick it to the man and make a glorious comeback via Netflix.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd he surely did return, but it wasn\u2019t the unanimous victory some of us were hoping for.\n\n\n\nWith his Netflix specials, it was clear that Chappelle had not lost his sharp comedic edge and that he was still 100 percent on point about the subtleties and not-so-subtleties of white supremacy and how its food chain works (e.g., \u201cWhite women not liking their cut\u201d).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, it was also very clear that Chappelle may not have completely crossed over into 2017 with the rest of us. This was particularly the case with his Bill Cosby-heavy rape jokes (e.g., \u201cHe rapes but he saves!\u201d), and his weirdly obsessive jokes at the expense of queer and trans folx.\n\nIt was fairly disappointing, to say the least, to see someone willing to push the envelope in one area of oppression (racism) and willfully refusing to adapt to the times in other areas (homophobia and transphobia).\n\nI didn\u2019t know it then, but it was surely gonna be an omen of what was to come in 2017: that killing our darlings and letting down our idols was going to be oh so necessary ... as there was absolutely no guarantee that they were going to grow and change with us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd what an omen it was.", "keywords": ["moments", "example", "woman", "women", "experienced", "straight", "disappointing", "unjust", "white", "2017", "black", "racist", "simmons"], "polarity": 0.04550587067253737, "subjectivity": 0.4992853288686623},

But the first and most important thing that this capsule should hold is the text of Mark Lilla\u2019s \u201cThe End of Identity Liberalism.\u201d\n\nAlthough published in November 2016, several days after Donald Trump was elected president, it managed to be both predictive of 2017 and indicative of it. It\u2019s also perhaps still the most prominent example of a new subgenre of disclosure that was born after the election and spread into 2017, where white people attempt to explain and sympathize with other white people\u2019s problematic political leanings without using the words \u201crace\u201d or \u201cracism.\u201d\n\nAnd like Citizen Kane and other form-subverting standard-bearers before him, Lilla invented his own rules for this genre by not only ignoring the role that race plays in our cultural and political landscape but also blaming the \u201crhetoric of diversity\u201d\u2014people merely wishing that their racial and cultural differences be respected and acknowledged because, for many of us, it\u2019s literally a lifesaving proposition\u2014for Trump\u2019s rise. As I said in an essay I wrote about this piece last year, he\u2019s the \u201cFrank Lloyd Wright of whitesplaining.\u201d\n\nAnd then what followed in 2017 was example after example of progressive and liberal white people stretching like Elastigirl to explain themselves and their cousins without indicting themselves and failing miserably, showing us their whole entire asses in the process. It was as if all of the cluelessness and obliviousness were gathered together and ground up, mixed into a stew with a generous batch of performative sobriety and then served to us on a slice of avocado toast.\n\nOf course, we\u2014well, most of us\u2014didn\u2019t need liberal white people to remind us that they\u2019re white. This is not something we have the privilege to forget because niggas with selective amnesia get dead. But us not needing to be reminded hasn\u2019t stopped them from trying to.

Acknowledgment of the possession of whiteness\u2014and all that it means\u2014is a vital initial step in attempting to rectify America\u2019s race-based wrongs. But what happened instead for many of these liberal whites was that this knowledge wasn\u2019t self-determined.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t them realizing that they\u2019re white. It was everyone else watching them act and react and then acknowledging just how aggressively white these actions were. And then the acknowledgment of whiteness reminded these liberals and progressives that they could always slip back into the safe confines of it when convenient.\n\nPerhaps, when Lilla\u2019s piece is placed in the capsule, we can put it on a slice of avocado toast, too.

His first piece in the HLR was on marijuana, which he concedes has had a vast effect on the black community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMy goal with the piece was simply to provide another perspective on the current legalization debates, which I felt haven\u2019t been reckoning enough with the harms done by prohibition, particularly to poor communities and communities of color,\u201d said Thomas. \u201cGiven that I think prohibition has proven a massive injustice, I think it\u2019s necessary to repair those harms with the wealth generated by legalization.

He was 78. . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCheers said by email, \u201cBra Hugh, as he was affectionately known, opened many doors for me in South Africa and across the continent. He placed me on the front row of African history and culture.\n\n\u201cHe helped me gain access to Nelson Mandela and other South African government officials, business people, and of course, a plethora of artists and musicians.\n\n\u201cI remember while researching the book, we spent hours in Witbank, the township near Pretoria, where he was born. Bra Hugh wanted me to feel and understand the rituals and nuances of his upbringing. I remember standing with him on the dusty railroad tracks in the township gaining a deeper understanding of his soul-stirring song, \u2018Stimela\u2019 \u201c (video). That song is about the life of coal miners from southern and central Africa conscripted to work for long hours and little pay in unhealthy South African mines.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOn another afternoon he was driving me through Alexandria Township when he stopped his sedan, pulled out his horn and began serenading the neighbors. He introduced me to Miriam Makeba, who took me into her confidence, cooked dinner for me on many occasions, and shared stories over the years about her anti-Apartheid work in the [States]. His sister Barbara [Masekela], South Africa\u2019s Ambassador to Washington, D.C. in the 1990s, was another source for details and good conversation.\u201d Masekela and Makeba married in 1964, but divorced after two years.\n\nRussonello added in his obituary, \u201cMr. Masekela came to the forefront of his country\u2019s music scene in the 1950s, when he became a pioneer of South African jazz as a member of the Jazz Epistles, a bebop sextet that included the pianist Abdullah Ibrahim and other future stars. After a move to the United States in 1960, he won international acclaim and carried the mantle of his country\u2019s freedom struggle.\n\n\u201cHis biggest hit was \u2018Grazing in the Grass,\u2019 a peppy instrumental from 1968 with a twirling trumpet hook and a jangly cowbell rhythm. In the 1980s, as the struggle against apartheid hit a fever pitch, he worked often with fellow expatriate musicians, and with others from different African nations. On songs like \u2018Stimela (Coal Train),\u2019 \u2018Mace and Grenades\u2019 and the anthem \u2018Mandela (Bring Him Back Home),\u2019 he played spiraling, plump-toned trumpet lines and sang of fortitude and resisting oppression in a gravelly tenor, landing somewhere between a storyteller\u2019s incantation and a folk singer\u2019s croon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn the 1970s and \u201880s, he collaborated with musicians across sub-Saharan Africa, constantly expanding his style to accommodate a range of traditions. ...\u201d\n\nIn a 2014 interview with Roland Martin on TVOne\u2019s News One Now (video), Masekela bemoaned the lack of respect for black and African history.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Africa, he said, \u201cWe\u2019ve been convinced that our heritage is barbaric, it\u2019s savage, it\u2019s primitive, it\u2019s heathen, it\u2019s pagan. And we\u2019ve bought that, so we celebrate other cultures instead and put ourselves into other cultures and pushed our heritage to the side. We can\u2019t even remember Motown, it\u2019s a little example. . . .\n\n\u201cI was talking to somebody in the dressing room, and I said like, if you look at the British, when Kate and William were getting married, they showed us like their heritage from thousands of years ago.\n\n\n\n\u201c . . .

I believe that if you\u2019re a society that doesn\u2019t know where it comes from, you\u2019re a society that isn\u2019t going anywhere.\u201d\n\nCheers said by email, \u201cHugh and I began discussing jump-starting his memoir project in 1995. He had piles of legal pad handwritten notes from an earlier effort with Quincy Troupe. It took nine years, but we got it done! \u2018Still Grazing: The Musical Journey of Hugh Masekela\u2019 was published by Crown in April 2004. Jacana Publishers released the South Africa edition in 2015.\n\n\u201cWe worked on the book everywhere...at his farm in South Africa, my house in South Africa, my townhouse in Oxford, MS, when I was teaching at Ole Miss, and in hotel rooms in New York in between his gigs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI was in the 8th grade when I first heard \u2018Grazing in the Grass\u2019 in 1968. That\u2019s when his music began to influence me. I met Hugh 10 years later in 1978, when I was a photo intern at Jet [m]agazine in Chicago. I went to cover a concert of his with Herb Alpert. They were performing at the Park West Club on Chicago\u2019s north side.\n\n\u201cMy 1995 Howard University doctoral dissertation, which explored African American kinship ties with South Africans and the Anti-Apartheid Movement, laid the research groundwork for Still Grazing.\u201d\n\nIn a 2012 video interview, Cheers said he was planning a photo book, \u201cHugh Masekela: An Illustrated Life,\u201d to be published in 2014.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI was still in development with the picture book concept with Bra Hugh and his staff,\u201d Cheers messaged Tuesday. \u201cWe tabled those plans when his health challenges began taking a toll in 2016. I spent time with Masekela last August in South Africa. We communicated via text during the fall.\u201d\n\nThe legendary musician died in Johannesburg on Tuesday after a lengthy battle with prostate cancer.\n\nThe family said in a statement, \u201cWe will, in due course, release details of memorial and burial services.

As leader of the Nation of Islam, Farrakhan is another star in Black America, but one whose name is synonymous with controversy.\n\n\n\n\u201cWasting no time, Muhammad snapped the news photo. But moments later, he faced a dilemma.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cObama had already become the darling of national Democratic politics. And the scent of a presidential run was strong.\n\n\u201cMuhammad and others almost immediately realized that the public release of this photo could mean major trouble down the road. Mainly because of bigotry and fear-mongering, the public release of that photo could doom America\u2019s chances of electing Obama as its first black president.\n\n\u201cMuhammad had not even left the scene when he received a call and the photo was being summoned by a member of the Congressional Black Caucus. Muhammad ultimately surrendered the disk to Minister Farrakhan\u2019s chief of staff. And it remained one of America\u2019s best hidden secrets for the next 12 years. ...\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe kept a copy for himself, however.\n\n\u201cFor the first time, more than a decade later, the glowing photograph of now former President Barack Obama and Minister Louis Farrakhan has been published in a book by Muhammad to be released Jan. 31 - \u2018The Autobiography of Charles 67X\u2019 . . .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlacks, Latinos Cite CNN for Objectivity on Cable\n\nBlacks and Hispanics choose CNN as the news source \u201cbelieved to be objective,\u201d while whites favored Fox News, according to a survey from the Gallup Organization and the Knight Foundation discussed Tuesday.\n\nThe pollsters asked respondents to choose among Fox News, CNN, NPR, local news (nonspecific), BBC, MSNBC, \u201cPBS NewsHour\u201d NBC News, the New York Times and ABC News.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhites chose Fox News, 29 percent to 10 percent each for CNN and NPR; blacks picked CNN, 28 percent to 9 percent for MSNBC and 8 percent for local news (Fox garnered 6 percent). Hispanics chose CNN, 21 percent, with 14 percent for Fox News. The other outlets were 7 percent and under.\n\nThe findings came in an overall study that concluded, \u201cAmericans believe the news media have an important role to play in democracy, particularly in terms of informing the public, yet they do not believe the media are fulfilling that role.\u201d It also concluded, \u201cAmericans\u2019 perceptions of the news media are generally negative, and their perceptions of bias have grown considerably from a generation ago. A majority cannot name an objective news source.\u201d\n\nHowever, the survey found African Americans, and to some degree Hispanics, on the other side of these issues, with respondents identifying as Republicans and/or white taking the opposing position. Blacks, Hispanics and Democrats expressed more positive views of the news media than did whites, independents and Republicans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe CNN finding is surprising in that MSNBC released Nielsen ratings on Jan. 8 that showed MSNBC finishing 2017 as the No. 1 network for all of cable in African American viewership for prime time (Monday through Friday, 8 p.m. to 11 p.m.). \u201cMSNBC delivered 483,096 African-American viewers, ahead of CNN, VH1, ESPN, OWN, TNT and BET,\u201d it said.\n\nAmong other results, the report said, \u201ca majority of blacks, 55%, rely on TV or radio talk shows to stay up to date, compared with 42% of Hispanics, 40% of whites and 34% of Asians.\u201d\n\nThirty-four percent of blacks said they shared news stories online, compared with 32 percent of Hispanics, 30 percent of independents, 27 percent of Republicans, 24 percent of independents and 25 percent of whites. Fifty-seven percent of blacks felt that social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter played a positive role in the news environment, compared with 54 percent of Hispanics and 37 percent of whites.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe survey provided a backdrop for a two-hour program, \u201cAmericans & the Media: Sorting Fact from Fake News\u201d (transcript), Tuesday at the Washington Post, featuring journalists and media critics. In a discussion of the effect of Donald J. Trump on the press corps, April Ryan of American Urban Radio Networks said the term \u201cfake news\u201d is \u201cputting a target on our heads,\u201d repeating that she had received death threats.\n\nRyan spoke as news reports said that Brandon Griesemer, 19, of Novi, Mich., was arrested last week and now faces federal criminal charges following an FBI investigation alleging that he called CNN headquarters multiple times with threats to \u201cgun down\u201d employees of the network for producing \u201cfake news,\u201d as Allie Gross reported for the Detroit Free Press.\n\nPanelists such as Stephen F. Hayes, editor of the Weekly Standard, noted that Trump had elevated genuine \u201cfake news\u201d outlets - which traffic in conspiracy theories, by giving them access to White House press briefings. He cited Gateway Pundit as one such outfit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHayes also said that conservatives had complained for years about liberal bias in the media but were too often dismissed as \u201cthere they go again.\u201d Panelists faulted the blurring of lines between news and opinion and urged all news media to label clearly the differences. When Stephanie McCrummen of the Washington Post, a native of Alabama, went to interview residents to pursue the story of U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore\u2019s sexual misconduct, residents were surprised that she was there to listen and not assert her opinion, they said.\n\nTrump was portrayed as making his presidency a show, with Jay Rosen of New York University calling him a competing news organization.\n\nThe poll results were based on self-administered mail surveys with a random sample of 19,196 U.S. adults ages 18 and older. \u201cGallup oversampled households known to include harder-to-reach respondents, specifically blacks, Hispanics and young adults,\u201d the organization said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA \u2018Best Actor\u2019 Surprised by Lack of Black Reporters\n\n\u201cAfter the SAG Awards Jaleesa Lashay, a reporter from Blacktree TV, asked Sterling K.

Of course, Kool-Aid was an ingredient. It was \u201cKool-Aid wine,\u201d after all, not \u201cHi-C wine\u201d or bitch-ass \u201cSunny Delight wine.\u201d But I could never determine what else was in there.\n\nWas it coconut oil? Pimento beans? Avocados? Old Bay? Pancake mix? Vanilla extract? Chicken stock? Melted Now and Laters?\n\nThe composition of the Kool-Aid wine continued to confound me. Until one day when I was 10 or 11 and I happened to be hiding in a living room closet with a clear view to the kitchen. And I finally was able to see what my dad used to make this exquisite and sublime refreshment.\n\nTwo packets of grape Kool-Aid. And a lemon.\n\nThat\u2019s it. There was nothing special at all about the Kool-Aid wine. It was just regular-ass Kool-Aid with a Giant Eagle lemon squeezed into it. Although the mystery was solved, I had put so much thought and existential weight into the mythical and ethereal characteristics of this mystery ingredient that the anticlimactic-ness of my discovery made me cry. This was the day I became a man.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyway, since then, life has also taught me that some mashups and collaborations work, and some don\u2019t.\n\nFor instance, last week I was in the mood for some lemonade but had no lemonade in the house. I did, however, have lemons and La Croix. So I decided to put both into the Ninja to see if I\u2019d be able to make some lemonade with a twist. And I did! Except the twist was, \u201cThis shit is fucking terrible and tastes like carbonated hot dog water.\u201d\n\nAnd, sometimes, like with my dad\u2019s Kool-Aid wine, the collaboration works.\n\nThe latter is true with the above painting of Michelle and Barack Obama as Justice (Janet Jackson) and Lucky (Tupac) from the movie Poetic Justice. It shouldn\u2019t work. Especially since, when I first saw the painting, my initial thought was that this was a real-time rendering of how Justice and Lucky would look today, in 2018. It wasn\u2019t until the third or fourth viewing that I realized it was Michelle and Barack.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich then made me realize that although I hadn\u2019t realized I needed a painting of Michelle and Barack Obama as Justice and Lucky from Poetic Justice in my life, I totally, absolutely, definitely needed a painting of Michelle and Barack Obama as Justice and Lucky from Poetic Justice in my life. And I only didn\u2019t know that I needed it because I didn\u2019t know it existed.\n\nI\u2019ve been waiting, for 25 years now, for something to replace the metaphysical import of Kool-Aid wine.

Some also say it was the news breaking shortly before the election that there had been a BET party at the White House where Bell Biv DeVoe reunited to perform \u201cPoison.\u201d Admittedly, I am the only person I\u2019ve heard express this theory, but as sure as the FBI shot down Otis Redding\u2019s plane to break the spirit of black people in 1967, history will bear me out.\n\n\n\nOne year and some change after the Election, as the nation is on the brink of being engulfed by fascism and obliterated by nuclear war, we might consider other factors that led us here. In The Brief, Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao, Junot D\u00edaz\u2019s magnum opus of Dominican history, a character opines that the cruelty that Dominicans show one another is the aftermath of having been under the rule of a murderous, racist dictator for 31 years. \u201cTen million Trujillos is all we are,\u201d she says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the matter of Donald Trump, I am suggesting the reverse. Maybe each of us brought this fate on ourselves by being too much like Trump. Not specifically the pathological-liar, rich, white developer person from Queens, N.Y., whose father attended a Ku Klux Klan rally, but Donald Trump, a transhistorical spirit of Absolute Wrongness. And we need to extract whatever\u2019s inside us that could possibly resemble that.\n\n1. Don\u2019t surround yourself exclusively with the same type of person.\n\nAlmost any picture of Donald Trump in President Barack Obama\u2019s old office looks the same: a crowd of shockingly unattractive elderly white men, from King White Walker Pence to Paul Mush-My-Face Ryan, celebrating a lunch of the bones of your child. Sometimes there\u2019s a wraithlike white woman in there. This is not just judging a book by its cover; read about Rex Tillerson and Steven Mnuchin, for example. These guys (and one or two ladies) are really the same: grotesquely wealthy, vitamin D-deficient, cruel, thoughtless and incompetent except in the game of fleecing other humans and raping the earth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen there\u2019s you. Perhaps you feel your friends and acquaintances are a rich, diverse stew of politically progressive strivers, primarily black and middle-class, a couple of nice whites, but also those two Asian-American friends, one Korean, the other Chinese. But how does your group look to those two friends, the two nonblack ones whose names your other friends keep confusing?\n\nThe un-Trump move here is to expand your horizons. Get to know a straight-up Marxist who can tell you what the U.S. did to Chile in the 1980s. Familiarize yourself with the worldview of black lesbian anarchists. Get to know your local purveyor of halal treats or one of the exceedingly dapper elderly Ethiopian gentlemen who convene outside your local coffee shop. Imagine yourself in the Oval Office surrounded by something like America\u2014not majority white, but a full range of different skin colors and hairstyles and different religious head coverings. And the next time one of your black friends confuses Jen with Kimberly, tell them that shit is racist.\n\n2. Familiarize yourself with the Constitution.\n\nSince it seems doubtful that your president has not read this particular law of the land, you seriously need to brush up. For example, did you know that our Constitution gives the executive branch the right to \u201cput sulky and unpatriotic blackes [sic] in the stocks on a public square of his choice\u201d?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, it doesn\u2019t.\n\nBut since Donald Trump seems largely unaware of his job description and is employing a just-do\u2013it-and-let-the-American Civil Liberties Union-come-after-me approach, it would behoove you to know the articles and certainly the amendments\u2014the First, 13th and 14th being of particular interest. And, oh yes, the 25th.\n\n3. Re-evaluate your relationship with reality television.\n\nIt is indisputable that reality television, the utterly mediocre The Apprentice, elevated Trump to the highest post in the most powerful country in the world. This must be addressed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCan you at least level-down your watching? Yes, I know, Cardi B, but thanks to reality television, the United States is flirting with the idea of nuclear war. Or, I don\u2019t know, maybe \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d can be the soundtrack to the postnuclear ashes of our society.\n\nAnd you might think about that while re-evaluating your relationship to Twitter, as well, since those digital screens are DT\u2019s direct line to your soul. The words of a revolutionary (if sexist) bard come to mind: \u201cYo, why don\u2019t you just back up from the Twitter, read a book or something? Read about yourself, learn your culture; you know what I\u2019m saying?\u201d\n\n4. Stop eating burned steak.\n\nPerhaps the only thing that Donald Trump has in common with a noncrazy black person is that he does not enjoy a bloody steak. Intriguingly, eating charred-crisp steak is a key cultural practice among roughly the same group of Americans once likeliest to eat boiled pig intestines. Who can say why?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI would hazard that as marginalized people, we did not want to be reminded of the proximity of meat (edible) to cow (animated, brown-eyed). Also, while chitlins have fallen from favor in my generation (leaving los boricuas y los mexicanos to take up the charge with tripe), it bears mentioning that chitlins are, in fact, very well cooked.\n\nAt any rate, the black community can be seen anywhere from fancy French bistros to Outback insisting on filet mignon the consistency and color of hockey pucks. But if that\u2019s Trump\u2019s preference, it must not be ours. If this is a problem, give up steak. That meat actually is a mammal with soulful eyes, and the American appetite for consuming cow is helping to heat up the climate and destroy human life. Wait, maybe I should have started there. We\u2019re in a climate crisis. Give up the steak already, damn.\n\n5. Don\u2019t be a bragging pussy grabber.\n\nMentioned if there is something you do analogous to grabbing women\u2019s private parts and bragging about it on the Access Hollywood bus. For example, the other day at the library with my sons, I overheard a security guard complaining to another about having to pay child support. The second guard (here I\u2019m paraphrasing but absolutely not lying) said, \u201cMan, I got so many women pregnant, but none of them ever came to me looking for anything like that. None of them!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, you may want to point a long, Obama-like finger at that admittedly African-American man and mutter a racist platitude about broken family values. Or you might want to give a sociological lecture about the aftermath of slave-family structure and contemporary assaults on black male masculinity. But that was this guy\u2019s grabbing of women\u2019s private parts and bragging about it to Billy Bush. Everyone has their version. Don\u2019t do yours.\n\n\n\n6. Prepare for public speaking engagements.\n\nRemember when Charlie Sheen had a public breakdown that got him fired from his multimillion-dollar job and decided to go on a 20-city tour titled, \u201cMy Violent Torpedo of Truth: Defeat Is Not an Option\u201d? He launched in Detroit, primarily yelling a nonsensical string of catchphrases, including \u201ctiger blood\u201d and \u201cwinning.\u201d I would bet my next check that many people who paid for those tickets went on to enjoy the live performances of Candidate Cheeto. But unlike Candidate Cheeto, who became president, Sheen was rightfully booed off the stage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSheen\u2019s \u201ctour\u201d was the rehearsal for this hot hell right here. Trump rambles off the top belligerently at press conferences, when some poor overworked Nazi aide probably poured hours into a teleprompter script; he does it in front of the U.N.; he does it at white power campaign rallies (why is this orange individual having campaign rallies? I mean, Pence I could see ... ); he does it in front of piles of manila folders; he gets up in front of cameras feeding satellites throughout the galaxy. He says whatever ignorant shit occurs to him, and when members of his death cult cheer, he says more of it. He improvises; he scats. It\u2019s not jazz, though; it\u2019s acid for the eyes, ears and soul.\n\nAnd it is why you and I must prepare. Maybe not to speak to millions about the fate of their health care or jobs or very existence, but to give a presentation to our co-workers, to a speech at our houses of worship or for an oral presentation for class (as a professor, I really beseech you on this one; I\u2019ve died during countless oral presentations). Maybe don\u2019t do what I\u2019ve seen every person who \u201cwrote their own\u201d wedding vows do, which was very obviously make up some shit right there at the altar. Let\u2019s prepare, and rehearse and say it because Trump wouldn\u2019t do it, and because it\u2019s classy and it\u2019s right.\n\n7. Let President Obama go.\n\nI have actually found it surprising the degree to which Donald Trump\u2019s agenda consists of pinpointing actions taken by the previous president, poking at them with his tiny, graceless hands and leaving orange, dusty smears. This appears to be his only vision beyond looting the treasury and whipping up frenzied crowds of the very people who will be crushed to dust by his policies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy counsel here is for those of us who can\u2019t get our mind off Obama for different reasons. Maybe you spent the last eight years saying, \u201cNigga didn\u2019t do nuthin but drone, deport and talk down to black men,\u201d and somehow the rise of Trump makes you even angrier about Obama\u2019s failings. Or maybe when things seem apocalyptic, you go to a special place in your mind where Barack and Michelle invite you to dinner and then put on Anita Baker\u2019s greatest hits, offer you a cordial and ask if you want to slip into something more comfortable.\n\nBut, most likely, you\u2019re hoping that man will save you. I know I am. You can keep crying neoliberalism and calling him a good Republican, but Obama is undeniable. He got elected with an African name and a black Chicago wife, and he managed to keep all those black people safe in the White House for eight years. Do you know how many people tried to jump that fence and make him stop inviting rappers up in there?\n\nThough I partake in many of the left\u2019s critiques of him, I can\u2019t help respecting him more since learning that his lean shoulder was all that was holding the door against the Purge we are living now. It makes me want him to full-on lead the opposition in Candidate Obama \u201908 mode, but more like a cross between Che Guevara, Malcolm X, Shirley Chisholm and Harriet Tubman\u2019s shotgun.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut he\u2019s done.\n\nHe\u2019s gone to a beautiful house in Kalorama, a Washington, D.C., neighborhood that is also home to Jared and Ivanka. He emerges every now and then to spit a few bars about health care, but mainly he saves his hot 16s for million-dollar speaking engagements with billion-dollar white people all around the world.\n\nThis is not a dis. He\u2019s commissioning the first black painters ever to do the presidential portraits, one of them the relatively unknown Amy Sherald. I know he loves us, but we\u2019re running on fumes here. Gil Scott-Heron once said there\u2019s no such thing as a superman. We have to save ourselves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNothing makes us more like Donald Trump than being obsessed with Donald Trump, passing his name back and forth like a virus. Even if it feels like he is personally torturing you, you cannot let him continue to enjoy having achieved his lifelong goal of being this country\u2019s, and maybe the world\u2019s, most mesmerizing spectacle. This is a piss-poor show, and he\u2019s watching us watching it while doing a lot of diddling with little appendages.\n\nMore importantly, watching, clicking, losing sleep and fuming about this individual is not what will stop him (or the congressional Republicans goodlordamighty, whom I haven\u2019t even addressed here) from disastrously altering human history. But do you know what will stop him (and them)\u2014I mean, besides being less like Trump? Great.

Black women showed up and showed out in various ways. Black men put their careers and livelihoods on the line to speak out against racial injustice, police violence, and sexual assault and harassment. Creative artists experienced amazing glow ups, and black teenagers all over the country showed that no matter what, still we rise. Let\u2019s take a look at some of the biggest winners of 2017.\n\nBlack Activism\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a year that began with us getting the worst president in the world, black activists continued to do the work to help black people stay alive and get free. That activism took on many forms\u2014from protests both loud and silent to creative arts projects to writing\u2014and it was prolific in the year 2017.\n\nBlack people fought and continued to fight for clean water for the people of Flint, Mich., as well as other cities; social justice; economic justice; and an end to the state-sanctioned murder of black people at the hands of police. These fights are not over, and if 2017 was any indication, our voices will only get louder in 2018.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeyonc\u00e9\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 broke the internet in February when she announced that she was pregnant with twins via an Instagram post, and her year went on an upswing that has not ended. Although we know she has plenty of haters, it\u2019s hard to understand how you can hate on someone so graceful, so beautiful, so talented and so free in her own black womanhood. Her pregnancy led to the birth of beautiful twins\u2014 which she has blessed us with time and time again. Oh, and Sir and Rumi were cute, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer charity and generosity are not always made public, but she gives from the heart when it matters most. Not to mention, her after-pregnancy snapback was real and an inspiration to us all. Deep down inside, she is just a \u201cTexas bama\u201d who has her fangirl moments just like the rest of us, and we are here for it. Long live Queen Bey.\n\nFenty Beauty\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe all have our own favorite makeup brands, but when Rihanna announced that she would be launching Fenty Beauty in September, black girls (and the rest of y\u2019all) went crazy. No, she didn\u2019t make it just for us, but she made it for us in that she kept black girls in mind when creating the color ranges. The products flew off the shelves faster than they could be stocked.\n\nFenty had other beauty lines shook time and time again because Fenty had the range. Just one month in, Fenty had $72 million in earned media value, showing us that the combination of Black Girl Magic and black-girl social media capital is a guaranteed win. Right on, Fenty. Right on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack High School Seniors Accepted to College\n\nDespite being told by America every single day that their lives don\u2019t matter, black students continued to push forward and show that yes, the hell they do. Even as people tried to call them underachievers and say they are destined to a life of nothingness, black kids stood up and loudly proclaimed, \u201cYes, we can!\u201d Whether they were getting accepted to all eight Ivy League schools, heading off to Harvard or fulfilling their dream of going to their favorite HBCU, black high school seniors did the damn thing in 2017, and we are proud of y\u2019all. Keep pushing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCardi B\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe don\u2019t dance no more, she makes money moves. If you look up the phrase \u201cglow up\u201d in the dictionary, right after the definition of the new vertical on The Root, there will be a picture of Cardi B, her tongue hanging out and the look of win on her face, because she seriously glowed up in 2017. Regardless of how you may feel about her, your hate and a Grammy snub won\u2019t stop her shine. She signed big deals, had one of the biggest hits of the year (my current theme song/anthem), got big props from the Queen herself\u2014and despite rumors of a potential breakup, her boo Offset proposed to her with an 8-carat diamond ring. Cardi did 2017 big as hell, and we can only expect that will continue in 2018.\n\nTerry Crews\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt takes a black man who is strong in will and mind to display restraint and not beat the shit out of a perverted white man who gropes his genitals in full view of everyone at a Hollywood party. It takes an even stronger black man to come forward during the #MeToo storm and admit that he, too, was sexually violated by a powerful white man in Hollywood. That strong black man was Terry Crews.\n\nWhile some questioned why he didn\u2019t just pummel Adam Venit when the Hollywood power broker allegedly grabbed his genitals at a party, Crews showed that it\u2019s a game of chess, not checkers, and in the end, the sound mind wins. He filed a police report, filed a lawsuit and spoke out against sexual assault in Hollywood, letting everyone know that he would not be a victim. He was named one of Time magazine\u2019s \u201csilence breakers.\u201d He dropped WME\u2014the agency Venit worked for that basically did nothing to protect Crews and everything to protect Venit\u2014and moved on to new representation, all without being the stereotypical angry black man that everyone wanted or expected him to be.\n\nThat is the very definition of winning. Kudos, Terry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBarack Obama\n\nBarack Obama won 2017 the day he left office as the president of the United States. I am very sure it was like when Scarface quit his job in Half Baked.\n\nOur president started wearing less and going out more. He sent his wife a cute Valentine\u2019s Day tweet. He got crowds and applause just for being a regular-ass dude. People wanted so much more of him, the bidding war over his memoirs reached $60 million. He received the 2017 JFK Profile in Courage Award. He even reported for jury duty in Chicago. He basically showed everyone that leaving the presidency hasn\u2019t stopped his shine or his charisma, and your orange-colored Oompa Loompa of a president could never. Come through, Barack. Come through.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nColin Kaepernick\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNFL ratings are down, and league officials don\u2019t know what to do about it. Good. The NFL deserves whatever \u201cL\u2019s\u201d it gets because the NFL turned its back on Colin Kaepernick. Meanwhile, Kaepernick continues to shine. When he started his silent protests during the national anthem last year, he was widely criticized by people who didn\u2019t understand his need and desire to fight for black lives or the recognition he got for it. None of that matters. Despite it all, Kaepernick is living his best life. He has gotten award after award, and he is even considering buying an NFL team. Take that, NFL. Long live Colin Kaepernick.\n\nBlack Women\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2017 was the year of the black woman. From your Auntie Maxine Waters to Serena Williams winning the Australian Open while pregnant to Karen Bass\u2019 hilarious takedown of Jeff Sessions to black women showing up to guarantee Roy Moore did not win in Alabama to Tarana Burke and the #MeToo movement, black women were here for you. Black women have always been here for you. Black women will continue to be here for you. Now black women need you to be here for us.

While waiting to pre-purchase tickets for Black Panther, I developed an unhealthy obsession with Fandango, and my wallet wept when the Funko POP! figures were released. I was excited to go to Wakanda, y\u2019all, and Wakanda did not disappoint.\n\nExcept for one aspect.\n\n\n\nMaybe.\n\n\n\nSee, something was revealed about the movie before its release: a missed opportunity at queer representation. Back in April, news spread of a rough cut where Okoye (Danai Gurira) and Ayo (Florence Kasumba) did a bit of flirting. Vanity Fair\u2019s Joanna Robinson had this to say:\n\n\n\nIn the rough cut of this Black Panther scene, we see Gurira\u2019s Okoye and Kasumba\u2019s Ayo swaying rhythmically back in formation with the rest of their team. Okoye eyes Ayo flirtatiously for a long time as the camera pans in on them. Eventually, she says, appreciatively and appraisingly, \u2018You look good.\u2019 Ayo responds in kind. Okoye grins and replies, \u2018I know.\u2019\n\nShortly after the story broke, Marvel reached out to say that no, their relationship was not a romantic one (as stated in the update to Robinson\u2019s article). Oh, and it turns out, the scene was cut from the film, hence the \u201cmissed opportunity\u201d commentary on every single article that pops up if you google the words \u201cBlack Panther Queer\u201d right now. Co-screenwriter Joe Robert Cole said this in an interview with Screen Crush:\n\n\n\nI think the short answer is yes. I know that there were quite a few conversations around different things, different directions with different characters, and characters that we may have. We thought, \u2018Well, maybe we\u2019ll work it this way with an arc or work it that way with an arc.\u2019 The scene you\u2019re talking about, I don\u2019t remember. I can\u2019t remember the exact exchange you\u2019re talking about, but I think it was really brief. I\u2019m not sure. I know that it was not \u2013 there wasn\u2019t some major theme through that we were looking to explore with that in terms of the story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI sat there, waiting to feel betrayed, like Santa didn\u2019t deliver the puppy I wanted, no matter how good I\u2019d been. It\u2019s an all too familiar feeling as a black, queer woman: the Hollywood game of \u201cQueerness? What\u2019s that?\u201d Some exceptions may apply, like if it\u2019s a niche movie that won\u2019t have an entire toy section dedicated to it or that one side character whose name you don\u2019t remember. And of course, there\u2019s Netflix or television (and I\u2019ve praised Black Lightning character Anissa Pierce to the heaven\u2019s above). But when it comes to those multi-million dollar box office hits? Yeah, no.\n\nSeeing Black Panther, I was fully prepared to be salty. But the salt never hit me. I went out, saw the movie, got home and ... No salt. Just pure black joy.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, then I thought, \u201cWow Bri, what kind of queer woman are you?\u201d I should\u2019ve been cursing Ryan Coogler out, swift and fast like my mama taught me when someone pisses me off. But after thinking it over, I\u2019m happy the scene didn\u2019t make it into the movie, and that feels blasphemous to admit as someone who is always championing representation\u2014especially for queer folks of color like me.\n\nBefore I explain why, let me preface it by saying two things: 1) I don\u2019t expect every queer POC to feel this way, and neither should anyone reading this. We\u2019re not some monolith that is always gonna see eye-to-eye, so don\u2019t be out here using my words to discredit someone\u2019s valid feelings. 2) People who have expressed disappointment with the scene\u2019s removal have still found joy in the movie. It doesn\u2019t make them a hypocrite, it just means that they\u2019re capable of criticizing something they love. And that\u2019s how improvement happens.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m gonna level with you, as someone who\u2019s been squinting through heteronormative romance to try and find a whisper of queerness: Okoye and Ayo flirting with each other ain\u2019t enough for me anymore. It\u2019s the bare minimum of queer representation\u2014the table scraps\u2014especially if it\u2019s two women, and especially if those two women are attractive.\n\nLet\u2019s be real: T\u2019Challa and Nakia are getting whole-ass scenes that go beyond, \u201cI looked at you, then you looked at me.\u201d That\u2019s what I want more of in my queer representation, especially considering the source material that people were referencing when discussing Okoye and Ayo: World of Wakanda. Written by Roxane Gay and Yona Harvey, this story is about Ayo and another Dora Milaje named Aneka (who doesn\u2019t appear in the movie, but people suspected Okoye had taken her place as a love interest). In the book, Ayo and Aneka are the focal points, and they\u2019re allowed to develop as both characters and lovers, with each turn of the page.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can understand the excitement of potentially including this aspect in the movie, but that breeze of commentary between Okoye and Ayo? That ain\u2019t it. A moment like that can get easily swept away as, \u201cYou\u2019re reading too much into this,\u201d or even, \u201cThat\u2019s just how women are.\u201d After all, if Katy Perry taught us anything, it\u2019s that she kissed a girl\u2014and she liked it\u2014but don\u2019t read too much into it. To do this plot justice, there\u2019d need to be multiple interactions between those women, ones that didn\u2019t solely revolve around flirtation.\n\n\n\nGIF\n\nI didn\u2019t think that was gonna happen with Black Panther. I would\u2019ve loved to see it, especially with all the time and care put into portraying Africa and black culture. But you know what else came with that clear love letter to Africa? Boycotts and plans to give negative reviews, because we\u2019re clearly trying to take over white superhero-dom.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow imagine, for a moment, the reaction if we also had queerness within this blackity-black movie. Actually, you don\u2019t have to imagine it, you can read the comments on any article that dares to complain about the scene\u2019s removal. Nothing says encouragement to implement some intersectionality like being told to let folks enjoy the damn movie without making things so \u201cpolitical\u201d\u2014even if there\u2019s already a comic featuring queer Dora Milaje.\n\n\n\nSo maybe Coogler and his crew are pacing themselves. Actress Florence Kasumba (who plays Ayo) recently spoke to Jamie Broadnax and Abraham Riesman in an interview for Vulture about it. For the record, Kasumba is here for queer Ayo, but also had this to add:\n\n\n\nThe thing is, if the makers would have wanted everyone to see the scene, it would have been in the movie. The final result that we\u2019ve seen, there were a few scenes that have been cut. Different scenes, also. They didn\u2019t make it into the movie for certain reasons, and at that point, I have to say: What their reason is, I can\u2019t tell you, because nobody told me about whether it\u2019s in or not. But at this point, I personally think people have no idea who T\u2019Challa is, who are the Wakandans, what is Wakanda, where is Wakanda, what is their culture. There are so many important things that had to be told in these two hours. So the focus was on what is so important for T\u2019Challa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI realize that all of this is a frustrating pill to swallow. And real talk: if there\u2019s any group that\u2019s used to being told, \u201cYour representation might be there later,\u201d it\u2019s queer POC. Black Panther made his first appearance back in 1966 and it took 50 years for there to be a comic based primarily on two queer characters ... and it quickly got canceled. So yeah, those disappointed reactions? Completely justified.

The music, the action and the cast of actors look amazing. The costuming alone is about to change the game. Black women are going to dominate cosplay and Halloween. Appropriators of black culture are working overtime as we get closer to this movie. (Watch out for Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian\u2019s new \u201cWoke-Kanda\u201d line from Nordstrom\u2019s\u2014you know she\u2019ll try it! )\n\nAmid that excitement, oh so quietly, it was announced Sunday night that World of Wakanda, the Black Panther spinoff comic that focuses on the Dora Milaje (all those amazingly dressed, capoeira-fighting black women in the trailer), was canceled. Many people will feel like this is a gut punch.\n\nMarvel\u2019s cancellation of a Black Panther comic book right after the movie trailer breaks the internet, and just a few weeks after it canceled another Black Panther spinoff, smells like a C-O-N-SPIRACY. I\u2019m here to tell you that comic books are a complicated business; there are levels to this. If we\u2019re serious about supporting black art, we\u2019ve got to show our love in dollars and not just tweets.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m one of those legitimate comic book fans. I go to conventions, I have thousands of comics in my house, I have the first Black Panther comic from 1966, and I even interviewed Ta-Nehisi Coates for The Root last year, right before he starting writing the new series. So I also know a lot about the business side of comics and how that differs from what we see on the big and small screens, which is what most people consume. Comics get canceled all the time, and it\u2019s usually just because of poor sales. Look at the World of Wakanda sales over the last six months:\n\nBlack Panther: World of Wakanda 11/16 BP World of Wakanda No. 1: 57,073 12/16 BP World of Wakanda No. 2: 45,009 (-21.1 percent) 01/17 BP World of Wakanda No. 3: 25,248 (-43.9 percent) 02/17 BP World of Wakanda No. 4: 17,454 (-30.8 percent) 03/17 BP World of Wakanda No. 5: 15,847 (-9.2 percent) 04/17 BP World of Wakanda No. 6: 14,547 (-8.2 percent)\n\nIn the current comic book market, a book is doing well when sales are hovering around 30,000 a month, and World of Wakanda hadn\u2019t been anywhere near that number since the second issue. Some will argue that WoW wasn\u2019t given enough time to gain an audience, given the kind of niche storylines the comic focused on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s some merit to this. The comic was centered on adventures in and around Wakanda, the fictional African nation ruled by T\u2019Challa, the Black Panther. As a spinoff, the main characters were rebellious members of the Dora Milaje, Aneeka and Ayo, who decided to start a revolution against the oppression of women and the monarchy system in Wakanda. Aneeka and Ayo also happened to be very open, very out lesbians, something that was OK in the comic, but that Marvel steadfastly tried to deny in the upcoming movie.\n\nMaybe those factors had something to do with the comic\u2019s inability to catch on with a wider array of fans, but the truth is, the book sales were cratering faster than Donald Trump\u2019s approval numbers. Some of the people upset now should have been out there buying the book before. A better example of a strange black comic cancellation was Black Panther and the Crew, which was canceled in May.\n\nBlack Panther and the Crew, written by Ta-Nehisi Coates and Yona Harvey, was canceled after one issue because of \u201cpoor sales,\u201d according to an interview with Coates himself. That seemed awfully premature, given that the comic debuted over the 35,000 threshold and featured characters prominent in comics, movies and on Netflix.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA comic featuring a superhero team of Storm, Black Panther, Luke Cage and Misty Knight doesn\u2019t deserve more than six months to finish out its first story? Maybe Crew was a little too Black Lives Matter for the publisher? Maybe Marvel projected that the subsequent issues would fall off with a debut hitting only 35,000? Maybe there just wasn\u2019t an investment in the book. Which brings us to the main title, Black Panther, from which all of these canceled books were spun off.\n\nBlack Panther is just now hovering on the 30,000 line of death, but there is absolutely no chance that book is going to get canceled before February 2018, when we\u2019re all trading in Beyonc\u00e9 and National Museum of African American History and Culture tickets to stand in line beyond Barack and Michelle to see Black Panther on opening night. Why? Marvel Comics as a staff label and an organization has a vested interest in maintaining the core Black Panther book as a baseline of support for the movie.\n\nHowever, in the world of comics, books like Black Panther get canceled all the time. Yes, T\u2019Challa has a 51-year history in comics and an upcoming movie, but other books have that same r\u00e9sum\u00e9, such as The Flash, Thor and Green Lantern, and have been canceled dozens of times over the years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe relationship between comic book movies and comics is a lot like the music industry and radio. People listen to radio or streaming services for free, love a song, but don\u2019t pay to download it. People can cheer for Ryan Coogler putting together an amazing Black Panther movie but don\u2019t buy the comics, and are shocked when they get canceled.\n\nThe easiest solution to the disappointment of World of Wakanda is to simply buy the comic! Buy it for yourself, your cousin or a godchild who needs a new hobby. I bought the main Black Panther comic even though it took Coates a few months to adjust to modern comic-writing. Now I love the book. I bought World of Wakanda, even though it wasn\u2019t my cup of tea, because I wanted to support black art. I bought Black Panther and the Crew because I really liked the storyline.\n\nIf every black person who watched the Black Panther trailer online or who downloaded \u201cLegend Has It\u201d by Run the Jewels after that trailer (still listening to it in my car) bought a Black Panther comic this week, there\u2019d probably be another spinoff launched by this summer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWakanda will be there for us next February. Now it\u2019s up to us to spend the next eight months making sure we all put down our monthly comic deposits to earn our passports.", "keywords": ["bp", "comic", "women", "spinoff", "world", "comics", "cancels", "book", "canceled", "trailer", "panther", "black", "wakanda", "drops", "marvel", "hours"], "polarity": 0.04414453249199009, "subjectivity": 0.4534179568077868},

While waiting to pre-purchase tickets for Black Panther, I developed an unhealthy obsession with Fandango, and my wallet wept when the Funko POP! figures were released. I was excited to go to Wakanda, y\u2019all, and Wakanda did not disappoint.\n\nExcept for one aspect.\n\n\n\nMaybe.\n\n\n\nSee, something was revealed about the movie before its release: a missed opportunity at queer representation. Back in April, news spread of a rough cut where Okoye (Danai Gurira) and Ayo (Florence Kasumba) did a bit of flirting. Vanity Fair\u2019s Joanna Robinson had this to say:\n\n\n\nIn the rough cut of this Black Panther scene, we see Gurira\u2019s Okoye and Kasumba\u2019s Ayo swaying rhythmically back in formation with the rest of their team. Okoye eyes Ayo flirtatiously for a long time as the camera pans in on them. Eventually, she says, appreciatively and appraisingly, \u2018You look good.\u2019 Ayo responds in kind. Okoye grins and replies, \u2018I know.\u2019\n\nShortly after the story broke, Marvel reached out to say that no, their relationship was not a romantic one (as stated in the update to Robinson\u2019s article). Oh, and it turns out, the scene was cut from the film, hence the \u201cmissed opportunity\u201d commentary on every single article that pops up if you google the words \u201cBlack Panther Queer\u201d right now. Co-screenwriter Joe Robert Cole said this in an interview with Screen Crush:\n\n\n\nI think the short answer is yes. I know that there were quite a few conversations around different things, different directions with different characters, and characters that we may have. We thought, \u2018Well, maybe we\u2019ll work it this way with an arc or work it that way with an arc.\u2019 The scene you\u2019re talking about, I don\u2019t remember. I can\u2019t remember the exact exchange you\u2019re talking about, but I think it was really brief. I\u2019m not sure. I know that it was not \u2013 there wasn\u2019t some major theme through that we were looking to explore with that in terms of the story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI sat there, waiting to feel betrayed, like Santa didn\u2019t deliver the puppy I wanted, no matter how good I\u2019d been. It\u2019s an all too familiar feeling as a black, queer woman: the Hollywood game of \u201cQueerness? What\u2019s that?\u201d Some exceptions may apply, like if it\u2019s a niche movie that won\u2019t have an entire toy section dedicated to it or that one side character whose name you don\u2019t remember. And of course, there\u2019s Netflix or television (and I\u2019ve praised Black Lightning character Anissa Pierce to the heaven\u2019s above). But when it comes to those multi-million dollar box office hits? Yeah, no.\n\nSeeing Black Panther, I was fully prepared to be salty. But the salt never hit me. I went out, saw the movie, got home and ... No salt. Just pure black joy.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, then I thought, \u201cWow Bri, what kind of queer woman are you?\u201d I should\u2019ve been cursing Ryan Coogler out, swift and fast like my mama taught me when someone pisses me off. But after thinking it over, I\u2019m happy the scene didn\u2019t make it into the movie, and that feels blasphemous to admit as someone who is always championing representation\u2014especially for queer folks of color like me.\n\nBefore I explain why, let me preface it by saying two things: 1) I don\u2019t expect every queer POC to feel this way, and neither should anyone reading this. We\u2019re not some monolith that is always gonna see eye-to-eye, so don\u2019t be out here using my words to discredit someone\u2019s valid feelings. 2) People who have expressed disappointment with the scene\u2019s removal have still found joy in the movie. It doesn\u2019t make them a hypocrite, it just means that they\u2019re capable of criticizing something they love. And that\u2019s how improvement happens.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m gonna level with you, as someone who\u2019s been squinting through heteronormative romance to try and find a whisper of queerness: Okoye and Ayo flirting with each other ain\u2019t enough for me anymore. It\u2019s the bare minimum of queer representation\u2014the table scraps\u2014especially if it\u2019s two women, and especially if those two women are attractive.\n\nLet\u2019s be real: T\u2019Challa and Nakia are getting whole-ass scenes that go beyond, \u201cI looked at you, then you looked at me.\u201d That\u2019s what I want more of in my queer representation, especially considering the source material that people were referencing when discussing Okoye and Ayo: World of Wakanda. Written by Roxane Gay and Yona Harvey, this story is about Ayo and another Dora Milaje named Aneka (who doesn\u2019t appear in the movie, but people suspected Okoye had taken her place as a love interest). In the book, Ayo and Aneka are the focal points, and they\u2019re allowed to develop as both characters and lovers, with each turn of the page.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can understand the excitement of potentially including this aspect in the movie, but that breeze of commentary between Okoye and Ayo? That ain\u2019t it. A moment like that can get easily swept away as, \u201cYou\u2019re reading too much into this,\u201d or even, \u201cThat\u2019s just how women are.\u201d After all, if Katy Perry taught us anything, it\u2019s that she kissed a girl\u2014and she liked it\u2014but don\u2019t read too much into it. To do this plot justice, there\u2019d need to be multiple interactions between those women, ones that didn\u2019t solely revolve around flirtation.\n\n\n\nGIF\n\nI didn\u2019t think that was gonna happen with Black Panther. I would\u2019ve loved to see it, especially with all the time and care put into portraying Africa and black culture. But you know what else came with that clear love letter to Africa? Boycotts and plans to give negative reviews, because we\u2019re clearly trying to take over white superhero-dom.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow imagine, for a moment, the reaction if we also had queerness within this blackity-black movie. Actually, you don\u2019t have to imagine it, you can read the comments on any article that dares to complain about the scene\u2019s removal. Nothing says encouragement to implement some intersectionality like being told to let folks enjoy the damn movie without making things so \u201cpolitical\u201d\u2014even if there\u2019s already a comic featuring queer Dora Milaje.\n\n\n\nSo maybe Coogler and his crew are pacing themselves. Actress Florence Kasumba (who plays Ayo) recently spoke to Jamie Broadnax and Abraham Riesman in an interview for Vulture about it. For the record, Kasumba is here for queer Ayo, but also had this to add:\n\n\n\nThe thing is, if the makers would have wanted everyone to see the scene, it would have been in the movie. The final result that we\u2019ve seen, there were a few scenes that have been cut. Different scenes, also. They didn\u2019t make it into the movie for certain reasons, and at that point, I have to say: What their reason is, I can\u2019t tell you, because nobody told me about whether it\u2019s in or not. But at this point, I personally think people have no idea who T\u2019Challa is, who are the Wakandans, what is Wakanda, where is Wakanda, what is their culture. There are so many important things that had to be told in these two hours. So the focus was on what is so important for T\u2019Challa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI realize that all of this is a frustrating pill to swallow. And real talk: if there\u2019s any group that\u2019s used to being told, \u201cYour representation might be there later,\u201d it\u2019s queer POC. Black Panther made his first appearance back in 1966 and it took 50 years for there to be a comic based primarily on two queer characters ... and it quickly got canceled. So yeah, those disappointed reactions? Completely justified. I might want better representation before I settle on any ol\u2019 thing, but I also know that when you\u2019re starving, table scraps are savored like a full course meal.\n\nBut if there\u2019s something I want you to take away from this: it\u2019s that we\u2019re actually discussing queer women of color making a big screen appearance, and we\u2019re being taken seriously.

While waiting to pre-purchase tickets for Black Panther, I developed an unhealthy obsession with Fandango, and my wallet wept when the Funko POP! figures were released. I was excited to go to Wakanda, y\u2019all, and Wakanda did not disappoint.\n\nExcept for one aspect.\n\n\n\nMaybe.\n\n\n\nSee, something was revealed about the movie before its release: a missed opportunity at queer representation. Back in April, news spread of a rough cut where Okoye (Danai Gurira) and Ayo (Florence Kasumba) did a bit of flirting. Vanity Fair\u2019s Joanna Robinson had this to say:\n\n\n\nIn the rough cut of this Black Panther scene, we see Gurira\u2019s Okoye and Kasumba\u2019s Ayo swaying rhythmically back in formation with the rest of their team. Okoye eyes Ayo flirtatiously for a long time as the camera pans in on them. Eventually, she says, appreciatively and appraisingly, \u2018You look good.\u2019 Ayo responds in kind. Okoye grins and replies, \u2018I know.\u2019\n\nShortly after the story broke, Marvel reached out to say that no, their relationship was not a romantic one (as stated in the update to Robinson\u2019s article). Oh, and it turns out, the scene was cut from the film, hence the \u201cmissed opportunity\u201d commentary on every single article that pops up if you google the words \u201cBlack Panther Queer\u201d right now. Co-screenwriter Joe Robert Cole said this in an interview with Screen Crush:\n\n\n\nI think the short answer is yes. I know that there were quite a few conversations around different things, different directions with different characters, and characters that we may have. We thought, \u2018Well, maybe we\u2019ll work it this way with an arc or work it that way with an arc.\u2019 The scene you\u2019re talking about, I don\u2019t remember. I can\u2019t remember the exact exchange you\u2019re talking about, but I think it was really brief. I\u2019m not sure. I know that it was not \u2013 there wasn\u2019t some major theme through that we were looking to explore with that in terms of the story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI sat there, waiting to feel betrayed, like Santa didn\u2019t deliver the puppy I wanted, no matter how good I\u2019d been. It\u2019s an all too familiar feeling as a black, queer woman: the Hollywood game of \u201cQueerness? What\u2019s that?\u201d Some exceptions may apply, like if it\u2019s a niche movie that won\u2019t have an entire toy section dedicated to it or that one side character whose name you don\u2019t remember. And of course, there\u2019s Netflix or television (and I\u2019ve praised Black Lightning character Anissa Pierce to the heaven\u2019s above). But when it comes to those multi-million dollar box office hits? Yeah, no.\n\nSeeing Black Panther, I was fully prepared to be salty. But the salt never hit me. I went out, saw the movie, got home and ... No salt. Just pure black joy.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, then I thought, \u201cWow Bri, what kind of queer woman are you?\u201d I should\u2019ve been cursing Ryan Coogler out, swift and fast like my mama taught me when someone pisses me off. But after thinking it over, I\u2019m happy the scene didn\u2019t make it into the movie, and that feels blasphemous to admit as someone who is always championing representation\u2014especially for queer folks of color like me.\n\nBefore I explain why, let me preface it by saying two things: 1) I don\u2019t expect every queer POC to feel this way, and neither should anyone reading this. We\u2019re not some monolith that is always gonna see eye-to-eye, so don\u2019t be out here using my words to discredit someone\u2019s valid feelings. 2) People who have expressed disappointment with the scene\u2019s removal have still found joy in the movie. It doesn\u2019t make them a hypocrite, it just means that they\u2019re capable of criticizing something they love. And that\u2019s how improvement happens.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m gonna level with you, as someone who\u2019s been squinting through heteronormative romance to try and find a whisper of queerness: Okoye and Ayo flirting with each other ain\u2019t enough for me anymore. It\u2019s the bare minimum of queer representation\u2014the table scraps\u2014especially if it\u2019s two women, and especially if those two women are attractive.\n\nLet\u2019s be real: T\u2019Challa and Nakia are getting whole-ass scenes that go beyond, \u201cI looked at you, then you looked at me.\u201d That\u2019s what I want more of in my queer representation, especially considering the source material that people were referencing when discussing Okoye and Ayo: World of Wakanda. Written by Roxane Gay and Yona Harvey, this story is about Ayo and another Dora Milaje named Aneka (who doesn\u2019t appear in the movie, but people suspected Okoye had taken her place as a love interest). In the book, Ayo and Aneka are the focal points, and they\u2019re allowed to develop as both characters and lovers, with each turn of the page.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can understand the excitement of potentially including this aspect in the movie, but that breeze of commentary between Okoye and Ayo? That ain\u2019t it. A moment like that can get easily swept away as, \u201cYou\u2019re reading too much into this,\u201d or even, \u201cThat\u2019s just how women are.\u201d After all, if Katy Perry taught us anything, it\u2019s that she kissed a girl\u2014and she liked it\u2014but don\u2019t read too much into it. To do this plot justice, there\u2019d need to be multiple interactions between those women, ones that didn\u2019t solely revolve around flirtation.\n\n\n\nGIF\n\nI didn\u2019t think that was gonna happen with Black Panther. I would\u2019ve loved to see it, especially with all the time and care put into portraying Africa and black culture. But you know what else came with that clear love letter to Africa? Boycotts and plans to give negative reviews, because we\u2019re clearly trying to take over white superhero-dom.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow imagine, for a moment, the reaction if we also had queerness within this blackity-black movie. Actually, you don\u2019t have to imagine it, you can read the comments on any article that dares to complain about the scene\u2019s removal. Nothing says encouragement to implement some intersectionality like being told to let folks enjoy the damn movie without making things so \u201cpolitical\u201d\u2014even if there\u2019s already a comic featuring queer Dora Milaje.\n\n\n\nSo maybe Coogler and his crew are pacing themselves. Actress Florence Kasumba (who plays Ayo) recently spoke to Jamie Broadnax and Abraham Riesman in an interview for Vulture about it. For the record, Kasumba is here for queer Ayo, but also had this to add:\n\n\n\nThe thing is, if the makers would have wanted everyone to see the scene, it would have been in the movie. The final result that we\u2019ve seen, there were a few scenes that have been cut. Different scenes, also. They didn\u2019t make it into the movie for certain reasons, and at that point, I have to say: What their reason is, I can\u2019t tell you, because nobody told me about whether it\u2019s in or not. But at this point, I personally think people have no idea who T\u2019Challa is, who are the Wakandans, what is Wakanda, where is Wakanda, what is their culture. There are so many important things that had to be told in these two hours. So the focus was on what is so important for T\u2019Challa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI realize that all of this is a frustrating pill to swallow. And real talk: if there\u2019s any group that\u2019s used to being told, \u201cYour representation might be there later,\u201d it\u2019s queer POC. Black Panther made his first appearance back in 1966 and it took 50 years for there to be a comic based primarily on two queer characters ... and it quickly got canceled. So yeah, those disappointed reactions? Completely justified. I might want better representation before I settle on any ol\u2019 thing, but I also know that when you\u2019re starving, table scraps are savored like a full course meal.\n\nBut if there\u2019s something I want you to take away from this: it\u2019s that we\u2019re actually discussing queer women of color making a big screen appearance, and we\u2019re being taken seriously. This scene has started something, and if Coogler puts as much effort into artfully portraying queerness as he did blackness, the future movies in the series will be the most intersectional thing in any movie-verse, not just Marvel\u2019s.\n\nI never thought my cynical, eye-rolling, \u201cOf course the queer scene got cut,\u201d self would be saying this, but I think the forces behind this movie are capable of giving queer characters the respect they deserve.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019re not there yet, but I think we can be in the future.", "keywords": ["emotions", "dont", "ayo", "women", "scene", "queer", "think", "okoye", "play", "movie", "panther", "black", "representation"], "polarity": 0.12237330712101353, "subjectivity": 0.49367263725061883},

Johnson, co-founder of Johnson Publishing Co., publishers of Ebony and Jet magazines.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe helped create the foundations of this [African American] struggle in the forties and fifties when the ground was hard and there were few laborers,\u201d Johnson wrote in the book. \u201c. . . we anticipated the changes and gave focus and form to them. In 1959, for example, I detected a growing interest in Black history and authorized a pathfinding Black history series. The response was so enthusiastic that we published a book, Lerone Bennett\u2019s Before the Mayflower, which became one of the most widely read Black History books ever. This marked the beginning of the Johnson Publishing Company Book Division. . . .\u201d\n\nDespite Bennett\u2019s passion for writing history for the average person, he wanted journalists to be generalists. \u201cI\u2019ve always believed that you write history one day and you write entertainment the next,\u201d he said in \u201cWriting for a Black Publication,\u201d (video) a 2010 interview with the Visionary Project.\n\nThus, his Ebony would feature such purported people-pleasers as \u201cIs It True What They Say About Twins?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBennett\u2019s association with Ebony, which he helped make the nation\u2019s leading African American publication, ended in 2009 when the publication forced his daughter Joy from the editorial staff.

The magazine complied, adding that \u201chis wise counsel will always be appreciated.\u201d\n\nBennett was born in Clarksdale, Miss., and grew up in Jackson.

He has always considered Morehouse as the center of his academic development. After graduating, Bennett formally entered the world of journalism as a reporter for the now defunct Atlanta Daily World. He became the city editor for the magazine and worked there until 1953, when he began his work as an associate editor at Jet magazine in Chicago, Illinois. In 1954, Bennett became an associate editor at Ebony and he was promoted to senior editor of the magazine in 1958. Since then, his comprehensive articles have become one of the magazine\u2019s literary hallmarks.\u201d He retired in 2005.\n\nAt Morehouse, Bennett was a classmate of Martin Luther King Jr., Mohr wrote.\n\nMohr\u2019s story also said, \u201cIn 2006 he was inducted into the Hall of Fame of the National Association of Black Journalists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn February, Bennett\u2019s footprints and those of 12 others were added to the International Civil Rights Walk of Fame near the Atlanta church where King preached.

But in the short term, the Trump-backed immigration proposal, combined with other recent moves by the administration and its allies \u2014 support for voter suppression, gerrymandering and various other schemes to disenfranchise minority voters \u2014 could extend the white hegemony that brought Trump to power and sustains Republicans.\n\n\u201cFor ages, Republicans said that their beef was with illegal immigrants and that legal immigrants should be embraced and welcomed. No longer. In the immigration fight on the Hill, there is broad bipartisan consensus to legalize the \u2018dreamers\u2019 \u2014 illegal immigrants brought here as children \u2014 and to fortify border security.

While waiting to pre-purchase tickets for Black Panther, I developed an unhealthy obsession with Fandango, and my wallet wept when the Funko POP! figures were released. I was excited to go to Wakanda, y\u2019all, and Wakanda did not disappoint.\n\nExcept for one aspect.\n\n\n\nMaybe.\n\n\n\nSee, something was revealed about the movie before its release: a missed opportunity at queer representation. Back in April, news spread of a rough cut where Okoye (Danai Gurira) and Ayo (Florence Kasumba) did a bit of flirting. Vanity Fair\u2019s Joanna Robinson had this to say:\n\n\n\nIn the rough cut of this Black Panther scene, we see Gurira\u2019s Okoye and Kasumba\u2019s Ayo swaying rhythmically back in formation with the rest of their team. Okoye eyes Ayo flirtatiously for a long time as the camera pans in on them. Eventually, she says, appreciatively and appraisingly, \u2018You look good.\u2019 Ayo responds in kind. Okoye grins and replies, \u2018I know.\u2019\n\nShortly after the story broke, Marvel reached out to say that no, their relationship was not a romantic one (as stated in the update to Robinson\u2019s article). Oh, and it turns out, the scene was cut from the film, hence the \u201cmissed opportunity\u201d commentary on every single article that pops up if you google the words \u201cBlack Panther Queer\u201d right now. Co-screenwriter Joe Robert Cole said this in an interview with Screen Crush:\n\n\n\nI think the short answer is yes. I know that there were quite a few conversations around different things, different directions with different characters, and characters that we may have. We thought, \u2018Well, maybe we\u2019ll work it this way with an arc or work it that way with an arc.\u2019 The scene you\u2019re talking about, I don\u2019t remember. I can\u2019t remember the exact exchange you\u2019re talking about, but I think it was really brief. I\u2019m not sure. I know that it was not \u2013 there wasn\u2019t some major theme through that we were looking to explore with that in terms of the story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI sat there, waiting to feel betrayed, like Santa didn\u2019t deliver the puppy I wanted, no matter how good I\u2019d been. It\u2019s an all too familiar feeling as a black, queer woman: the Hollywood game of \u201cQueerness? What\u2019s that?\u201d Some exceptions may apply, like if it\u2019s a niche movie that won\u2019t have an entire toy section dedicated to it or that one side character whose name you don\u2019t remember. And of course, there\u2019s Netflix or television (and I\u2019ve praised Black Lightning character Anissa Pierce to the heaven\u2019s above). But when it comes to those multi-million dollar box office hits? Yeah, no.\n\nSeeing Black Panther, I was fully prepared to be salty. But the salt never hit me. I went out, saw the movie, got home and ... No salt. Just pure black joy.\n\nGIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, then I thought, \u201cWow Bri, what kind of queer woman are you?\u201d I should\u2019ve been cursing Ryan Coogler out, swift and fast like my mama taught me when someone pisses me off. But after thinking it over, I\u2019m happy the scene didn\u2019t make it into the movie, and that feels blasphemous to admit as someone who is always championing representation\u2014especially for queer folks of color like me.\n\nBefore I explain why, let me preface it by saying two things: 1) I don\u2019t expect every queer POC to feel this way, and neither should anyone reading this. We\u2019re not some monolith that is always gonna see eye-to-eye, so don\u2019t be out here using my words to discredit someone\u2019s valid feelings. 2) People who have expressed disappointment with the scene\u2019s removal have still found joy in the movie. It doesn\u2019t make them a hypocrite, it just means that they\u2019re capable of criticizing something they love. And that\u2019s how improvement happens.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m gonna level with you, as someone who\u2019s been squinting through heteronormative romance to try and find a whisper of queerness: Okoye and Ayo flirting with each other ain\u2019t enough for me anymore. It\u2019s the bare minimum of queer representation\u2014the table scraps\u2014especially if it\u2019s two women, and especially if those two women are attractive.\n\nLet\u2019s be real: T\u2019Challa and Nakia are getting whole-ass scenes that go beyond, \u201cI looked at you, then you looked at me.\u201d That\u2019s what I want more of in my queer representation, especially considering the source material that people were referencing when discussing Okoye and Ayo: World of Wakanda. Written by Roxane Gay and Yona Harvey, this story is about Ayo and another Dora Milaje named Aneka (who doesn\u2019t appear in the movie, but people suspected Okoye had taken her place as a love interest). In the book, Ayo and Aneka are the focal points, and they\u2019re allowed to develop as both characters and lovers, with each turn of the page.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can understand the excitement of potentially including this aspect in the movie, but that breeze of commentary between Okoye and Ayo? That ain\u2019t it. A moment like that can get easily swept away as, \u201cYou\u2019re reading too much into this,\u201d or even, \u201cThat\u2019s just how women are.\u201d After all, if Katy Perry taught us anything, it\u2019s that she kissed a girl\u2014and she liked it\u2014but don\u2019t read too much into it. To do this plot justice, there\u2019d need to be multiple interactions between those women, ones that didn\u2019t solely revolve around flirtation.\n\n\n\nGIF\n\nI didn\u2019t think that was gonna happen with Black Panther. I would\u2019ve loved to see it, especially with all the time and care put into portraying Africa and black culture. But you know what else came with that clear love letter to Africa? Boycotts and plans to give negative reviews, because we\u2019re clearly trying to take over white superhero-dom.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow imagine, for a moment, the reaction if we also had queerness within this blackity-black movie. Actually, you don\u2019t have to imagine it, you can read the comments on any article that dares to complain about the scene\u2019s removal. Nothing says encouragement to implement some intersectionality like being told to let folks enjoy the damn movie without making things so \u201cpolitical\u201d\u2014even if there\u2019s already a comic featuring queer Dora Milaje.\n\n\n\nSo maybe Coogler and his crew are pacing themselves. Actress Florence Kasumba (who plays Ayo) recently spoke to Jamie Broadnax and Abraham Riesman in an interview for Vulture about it. For the record, Kasumba is here for queer Ayo, but also had this to add:\n\n\n\nThe thing is, if the makers would have wanted everyone to see the scene, it would have been in the movie. The final result that we\u2019ve seen, there were a few scenes that have been cut. Different scenes, also. They didn\u2019t make it into the movie for certain reasons, and at that point, I have to say: What their reason is, I can\u2019t tell you, because nobody told me about whether it\u2019s in or not. But at this point, I personally think people have no idea who T\u2019Challa is, who are the Wakandans, what is Wakanda, where is Wakanda, what is their culture. There are so many important things that had to be told in these two hours. So the focus was on what is so important for T\u2019Challa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI realize that all of this is a frustrating pill to swallow. And real talk: if there\u2019s any group that\u2019s used to being told, \u201cYour representation might be there later,\u201d it\u2019s queer POC. Black Panther made his first appearance back in 1966 and it took 50 years for there to be a comic based primarily on two queer characters ... and it quickly got canceled. So yeah, those disappointed reactions? Completely justified. I might want better representation before I settle on any ol\u2019 thing, but I also know that when you\u2019re starving, table scraps are savored like a full course meal.\n\nBut if there\u2019s something I want you to take away from this: it\u2019s that we\u2019re actually discussing queer women of color making a big screen appearance, and we\u2019re being taken seriously. This scene has started something, and if Coogler puts as much effort into artfully portraying queerness as he did blackness, the future movies in the series will be the most intersectional thing in any movie-verse, not just Marvel\u2019s.\n\nI never thought my cynical, eye-rolling, \u201cOf course the queer scene got cut,\u201d self would be saying this, but I think the forces behind this movie are capable of giving queer characters the respect they deserve.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019re not there yet, but I think we can be in the future.", "keywords": ["emotions", "dont", "ayo", "women", "scene", "queer", "think", "okoye", "play", "movie", "panther", "black", "representation"], "polarity": 0.12237330712101353, "subjectivity": 0.49367263725061883},

I\u2019ve RSVP\u2019d for and attended about six events. Once the Grammys are over, I will be taking a nap until further notice. This girl is exhausted.\n\nThe Grammy Awards have returned to the Big Apple for the first time since 2003, and as a New Yorker (by way of North Carolina), I gotta say, I was hype! I\u2019m a party lover. Correction: I am a girl who loves cool and free events with open bars, a plethora of fancy hors d\u2019oeuvres, photo opps and gift bags. I know I should be doing things that support my career, like networking, but I always end up keekeeing with my friends. Sue me.\n\nBut #GrammyWeek proved difficult once I received an overwhelming list of parties happening all over the city all week and up until the actual show on Sunday. I almost gave up, shut down and pulled my covers over my head, but I gathered my anxieties and RSVP\u2019d to things that sounded fun. Simple as that. So where did I go?\n\nQuestlove Supreme Taping\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe first invite I accepted for the week was a live taping of the podcast of Questlove of the Roots (not to be confused with The Root), Questlove Supreme. This was the show\u2019s first live broadcast, and with the special guest being rapper Common, I had to go!\n\nAlongside his Team Supreme co-hosts Boss Bill, Laiya and Suga Steve, Questlove facilitated a music-history-focused conversation around Common\u2019s hip-hop beginnings in Chicago; Questlove\u2019s love for and disrespect of his custom Yeezys; Common\u2019s five-minute college education; how J. Dilla was basically the god of music; Common\u2019s early career as a ball boy for the NBA; and so much more.\n\nWhen you sit down with Questlove, you\u2019re sitting with an encyclopedia of all things music, so each topic leads into something else. The 90-minute recording went well over two hours, and the entire audience leaned forward, sitting on the edge of their seats, wanting more. Myself included. I won\u2019t reveal too much because you should listen to Questlove Supreme on Pandora.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEssence Women in Music\n\nEssence threw a party to celebrate Missy Elliott. Now, if you know me, you know that Missy is my muse. She means much to me as someone who doesn\u2019t fit a mold but still shines. So I was there for Missy sightings (and free drinks\u2014thanks, Lincoln)! But I got the bonus of watching another legend honor Missy by presenting her with Essence\u2019s Visionary Award. That legend was none other than the snatched, edges, boots and hair-poppin\u2019 Janet Jackson! What?! I was in a room breathing in the air that Janet had just exhaled.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn her poised Janet whisper, she addressed Missy, saying:\n\n\n\nSome rhyme, some rap. Some act, some choreograph. Some write hit songs, some create whole new sounds. Some women are able to make her mark in some of these fields. But there\u2019s only one woman who has made her mark in all of these fields.\n\nAnd once Missy hit the stage, obviously emotional, she took us all to church, saying: \u201cI want all of you women in here to know that you\u2019re beautiful. You gotta believe in yourself. Because there are going to be times that people tell you you can\u2019t do it or you don\u2019t look the part. But I am a walking testimony.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter I managed to pick myself up off the ground from all the glorious #BlackGirlMagic swirling onstage, I managed to meet a fave, Daniel Caesar, and chatted it up with some folks we all love, like Danielle Brooks (Orange Is the New Black), Elle Varner, Tank, Tarana Burke and more. Essence can throw a party, y\u2019all! JANET!\n\nI would have been good to go home after this because 1) it was a very cold night, 2) I saw Janet and Missy, and 3) my feet were hurting, but my friends dragged me with them to the next party: a jam session with the Roots.\n\n\n\nThe Roots\u2019 Jam Sessions\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Legendary Roots Crew took up residence at New York City\u2019s Gramercy Theater all Grammy Week. From daytime until nighttime, they packed the theater for all kinds of events. From a live taping of Questlove Supreme to a School Daze panel to Questlove deejaying with kids, the day events were interactive and unique. But at night, that\u2019s when the show really started. The Roots shared the stage with all kinds of surprise guests, ranging from Roxanne Chant\u00e9 and Kirk Franklin (who legit tore the house down) to Jill Scott, Talib Kweli, Marsha Ambrosius and more.\n\nIt\u2019s fair to say that I haven\u2019t been to a jam session before, but I\u2019m pretty sure I went to the best jam session ever. The night I attended, the Roots brought out Kirk Frankin, Anthony Hamilton, Common, Talib Kweli and a few more. I missed everyone before Franklin because y\u2019all know I was out at the Essence event trying to comprehend what is life after Missy and Janet.\n\nBut I also got my life from Franklin singing a few classics like \u201cStomp\u201d and \u201cLean on Me,\u201d basically sparking up a church session right in the middle of a hip-hop and soul concert. Franklin is an entertainer, to say the least. He has the sturdiest Milly Rock and the smoothest chicken head I\u2019ve ever seen a grown man execute. His performance was the soul stir I didn\u2019t know I needed. The Roots kept the energy high in the room each night and put on the type of show you should pay for. But this was a free offering from the Roots that made Grammy Week just a bit more soulful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy name wasn\u2019t even on the list when me and my girls got to the door. When I tell you I was shooketh! But the door girl smiled at me and said, \u201cYou know what? Enjoy it,\u201d as she put a wristband on me. That wristband allowed me to go downstairs in the venue, which ended up being VIP. I spotted Black Thought as soon as I walked in.\n\nThought is a friend to The Root and often calls our Deputy Managing Editor, Yesha Callahan, and me his annoying little cousins. We love you, too, Thought. But that\u2019s not all! I also got a chance to meet Kirk Franklin (who thought he knew me and also thought I was hilarious), Anthony Hamilton, Derek Waters (Drunk History) and Dave Chappelle!\n\n\n\nIn doing all of this, I stayed out way too late (4 a.m.), because the next morning, I needed to be in Harlem (and I live in Brooklyn) by 11:45 a.m. for the Apollo Grammy Luncheon. Did I make it?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course I made it, but it certainly wasn\u2019t by 11:45. I got to Harlem around 12:15 p.m. Luckily I still had time to check in and get positioned on the red carpet. Jan. 26 was the Apollo\u2019s 84th birthday, so we got a chance to celebrate that on top of celebrating Grammy nominees like Anthony Hamilton, Ledisi, Luis Fonsi, the Baylor Project, Daniel Caesar and more (including Dapper Dan *screams*).\n\nApollo Pre-Grammy Luncheon\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe powers that be told us that Fat Joe would also be in attendance, but as we stood on the carpet and the hosts were announcing that the lunch was about to begin, we figured Joe blew us off for another fabulous event.\n\nI started packing up my equipment and was then told that Fat Joe was in the building. Joe made his way down the carpet as if he didn\u2019t have to be onstage in 30 seconds. When he got to me, I was able to ask him one question, so I did. Check it out here. His response certainly gave me pause.\n\nThe Apollo made us all feel special by hosting the lunch on the historic Apollo stage. I even got to rub the log! During the lunch, we were graced with a performance by Hamilton\u2019s background singers, the Hamiltones, and they did their signature down-home covers of Cardi B\u2019s \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d and Kendrick Lamar\u2019s \u201cLoyalty.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe chicken and waffles they served us were perfectly black and bougie, and the gift bag? Oh honey! The Apollo came through with the classy Tiffany\u2019s box, and I didn\u2019t know how to act. I haven\u2019t even opened the gift yet because I want to keep the gift pristine. So far, the Apollo has everyone and their mommas beat on gift bags.\n\nLincoln Dinner With Marsha Ambrosius\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLater that night, I went to a dinner hosted by Lincoln Motor Co., honoring Floetry\u2019s songbird, Marsha Ambrosius. She has a new album coming out, hopefully soon, but she played us a few of her classics, like \u201cSay Yes\u201d and \u201cButterflies.\u201d Swoon is an understatement.\n\nDuring the dinner (I had a burrata salad, filet mignon and New York cheesecake\u2014you care), Ambrosius shared that her daughter just turned 1 year old, and she and her baby\u2019s father are now married! Ambrosius\u2019 life looks different now, so one can only imagine what her new music will sound like.\n\nThis dinner was on Friday night. In my mind, I would go to other Grammy parties that I didn\u2019t RSVP to (hello, party crasher) because Friday. Nah, that wasn\u2019t the case. I was carrying around a tripod, and my backpack was filled with all of my work essentials and the exhaustion of 1,000 Grammy Weeks. Plus, I knew I needed to get up bright and early to make it to the ASCAP brunch. Priorities and such.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nASCAP Grammys Brunch\n\nI know, I know. I don\u2019t look exhausted. I struggled to wake up on Saturday morning so I could make it from my Brooklyn apartment into Manhattan for the ASCAP Grammys Brunch. And look at me up there. I don\u2019t even look like my bags have bags. They did, but that good Fenty helped me out. Well, that and sleeping in just a wee bit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was supposed to check into the carpet by 10:30 a.m.; I arrived at 11:45 a.m. I know, I\u2019m terrible, but guess what? According to my fellow journalists, I didn\u2019t miss much.\n\n\n\nI didn\u2019t really get the chance to chat with anyone on the carpet, but instead of getting discouraged, I decided to go into the party and see what I could gather from the inside. Shamefully, I went back to my default Danielle-at-the-party ways and immediately grabbed a cocktail and mini burger with foie gras on it (yasss, gawd) and sipped and chomped until I was full. I laughed and took too many pictures with my girlfriends, and we all talked about our Grammy Week experiences. One thing was consistent: We were all exhausted, but the week isn\u2019t over.\n\nSunday is the big day, and I\u2019m trying to decide if I am going to get up in the morning, get my nails and makeup done, slip on a black-tie dress and head to a watch party (not going to the actual Grammys, guys; not this time) or stay home, wrapped up in my sheets, rooting for everybody black at the Grammys on my own TV. I\u2019m gonna leave it up to you to decide which one I\u2019m leaning toward.\n\n", "keywords": ["missy", "im", "party", "didnt", "grammy", "know", "roots", "questlove", "grammyweek", "survived", "night", "week", "barely"], "polarity": 0.13366466086669576, "subjectivity": 0.5127212881864044},

When the chemistry is there, then ask questions like, \u201cIs it OK to touch ___?\u201d or \u201cDo you mind if I ___?\u201d Some people might consider this a mood killer, but guess what? Jail time and being heavily judged by your peers as a rapist are definite libido killers.\n\nIf You\u2019re Not Sure, Question It\u2014and Actually Get a Confirmation\n\nThey didn\u2019t say no, but they didn\u2019t say yes, either. Again: You NEED confirmation from your partner. To assume is making an ass out of you and me; so take away the doubt and question it. And don\u2019t stop there\u2014actually get a solid answer. Most times, body language can tell you a lot, even without words. If your partner is getting tense, ask again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsent Isn\u2019t Only Given by a Woman\n\nAllow me to burst a few bubbles: Consent isn\u2019t something that\u2019s gender-specific. If you think women are exempt from being sexual predators, think again. And if you think men are excluded from being victims, you\u2019re delusional.\n\nHere are some alarming statistics: According to the Connecticut Alliance to End Sexual Assault, 1 in 6 men will be sexually assaulted in their lifetimes\u2014and 1 in 4 of those victims are under the age of 12. These statistics are not mentioned to make women feel that their issues don\u2019t matter, but we need to acknowledge that men can be affected by sexual trauma, too. And we definitely cannot exclude the transgender, genderqueer or nonconforming populace from the conversation\u2014a 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey (pdf) found that 47 percent of transgender people are assaulted in their lifetimes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeing the Same Sex Doesn\u2019t Give You a Hall Pass\n\nFrom personal experience, I\u2019ve lost count of how many women I\u2019ve had to check for attempting to disrespect my personal space. As a bisexual woman who owns her sexuality, I\u2019ve found that some people fetishize my sexual orientation.\n\nOne night, while barhopping with friends, a plus-one from our outing put her hand on my breasts. Startled, I jumped back and immediately questioned her motives. Despite expressing how her repulsive actions made me feel, she instantly dismissed my feelings, suggesting that I \u201cget over it.\u201d She even pointed to my vagina, to imply that we have the same body parts. It ruined my night, and thankfully, others no longer felt comfortable bringing her to future functions. Violation of anyone\u2019s personal space, same sex or not, is wrong\u2014on a moral and legal level.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsent for One Thing Doesn\u2019t Mean Everything Is Covered\n\nJust because I agreed to one sexual act doesn\u2019t mean I consent to do other things. Also, what\u2019s comfortable today may not serve as a kink tomorrow. Frankly, we can be in bed together in the buff, and it doesn\u2019t warrant that we proceed any further than cuddling. If you can\u2019t handle that, state your boundaries up front, too.\n\nAnd While We\u2019re at It, I Can Stop at Any Time\n\nHold tight to your barf bag, boys and girls, because there are plenty of people who believe that if you start, both parties are obligated to finish the act. I don\u2019t care if you are five minutes away from climaxing; when I say stop, it means STOP. And it doesn\u2019t make me a prude or selfish; no simply means no. If there\u2019s even a possibility that your partner may want to slow down or is having second thoughts, with or without explanations, respect their wishes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut in the BDSM World, No May Mean Yes\n\nDespite the stereotypes, BDSM is a lot more than just whips and chains. It is heavily dependent on trust in your partner. For those unfamiliar with the abbreviation, it\u2019s broken down into bondage, discipline/dominance, submission/sadism and masochism. As a \u201cswitch,\u201d I learned quickly about the importance of safe words when engaging in sexual activities with partners. Prior to the act, you should truly know your partner\u2019s desires and dislikes.\n\nMost important, establish safe words and touches and understand their body language. Without this discussion, things can go terribly wrong fairly quickly. Because words such as \u201cno\u201d and \u201cstop\u201d can be viewed as \u201cyes\u201d in the submissive and domination community, these terms are typically avoided as cues to stop during the act. Words like \u201cred,\u201d \u201cyellow\u201d and \u201cgreen\u201d\u2014reminiscent of traffic lights\u2014are great word selections. Know the difference between BDSM play and assault.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust a Thought: Avoid Vulnerable Partners\n\nAs an FYI, a heavily inebriated or exceptionally high partner cannot reliably give you consent. If your partner isn\u2019t coherent and you perform sexual acts with this person, this can later be considered equivalent to rape. Alcohol and drugs can impair someone\u2019s judgment severely. If the connection is truly there, ask and wait for validation when the other person is sober.\n\n\n\nIf They\u2019re Not of Legal Age, Guess What?\n\nDo I have to mention that minors also aren\u2019t legally allowed to consent to sexual relations with an adult? On that note: Parents should consider having conversations with teens before they enter junior high school. On average, Americans lose their virginity at 17 years old, but they are experimenting far earlier, so it\u2019s worth gradually sparking conversations about sex, protection and consent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nParents: Don\u2019t view it as giving your children permission to lose their virginity, but more about their safety. Sexual education in school is on the decline, and caretakers should feel comfortable taking the responsibility to answer questions that their children may or may not have considered.\n\nRape and Sexual Harassment Are NOT Your Fault\n\nAbove all, know that you didn\u2019t ask for it. Rape and sexual harassment are not your fault. If you were raped or are uncertain whether you were sexually assaulted, please don\u2019t hesitate to seek assistance from organizations like RAINN, which will connect you to support groups or a talk therapist. Reach out to local authorities if you ever feel unsafe from a sexual predator. Know that you\u2019re not alone and that there are a host of places willing to help you through your trauma.

The plot was rife with quirks and unexpected turns, but the biggest surprise of all was that the diversity in the show reflected the diversity in Brazil. The cast featured myriad shades and races, absent the stereotypical casting, such as the confinement of black and brown actors and actresses to supporting characters with botched, surface-level backstories.\n\n3% | Netflix Official Site In a future where the elite inhabit an island paradise far from the crowded slums, you get one\u2026 Read more Read\n\nThis is what accurate representation looks like. This show reminded me of other shows on Netflix, like Sense8 and Black Mirror, whose colorful casts and stellar ratings demonstrate that diversity works. So what\u2019s wrong with the rest of Hollywood?\n\nI grew up on fantasy and science fiction, devouring books, television shows and film built under their umbrella. I stood in hourslong lines at bookstores waiting for sequels to be released, finishing thousand-page novels before the sun came up the next day. I went in full costume to midnight premieres, tickets in hand that I had purchased weeks prior. I wrote elaborate fan fiction and spent hours online moderating forums for people like me.\n\nI wasn\u2019t just any groupie, a random passerby stopping in to look\u2014I was a buff. I was ride-or-die. King Kong didn\u2019t have anything on me, because to me, a black girl at an all-white school, these genres that celebrated difference and rooted for the underdog were my safe haven.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese worlds gave me the belief that different was OK. Perhaps it just meant that one day I, too, would get a visit from Hagrid informing me that I was actually a witch. I would speak a goodbye curse over my haters, afflicting them with poorly timed gas or the constant sensation of having to sneeze. Then Hagrid and I would take off in his flying motorcycle, pettily cackling at everyone who never believed in me. That would make everything\u2014the microaggressive comments from my peers, the feeling of not fitting in, the surprise of my teachers at my intelligence\u2014all worth it because I would finally belong somewhere.\n\n\n\nIn these fictional worlds, anything could happen: magic, dragons, travel through space and time. Anything, that is, except diversity. The more I read and watched the genres, the more I felt just the way I had at school. As if I did not belong. It came as a huge blow that these mythical worlds that I immersed myself in had not, in their entire theory or practice, created a place for me.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen there was a \u201cplace\u201d for me, it was as a marginal, peripheral character. I didn\u2019t get to defeat Lord Voldemort. I didn\u2019t get to mount dragons and burn my enemies to a crisp by uttering \u201cDracarys.\u201d I didn\u2019t even get to travel to Narnia. My roles were different.\n\nIn these fictional worlds, anything could happen: magic, dragons, travel through space and time. Anything, that is, except diversity.\n\nI was Dean Thomas, appearing ever so often in the halls of Hogwarts, but never enough to truly be seen. I was Daenerys\u2019 personal assistant, whose insight, wisdom and strength were valuable enough to be leaned on, but not exceptional enough to actually be the Breaker of Chains. In worst cases, I was a villain, a miscreant or no one at all\u2014an extra fleeting through a scene too quickly to even be registered.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo why do fantasy and science fiction lack diversity?\n\n\n\nSometimes the erasure of black people in these genres masquerades under the guise of \u201chistorical accuracy.\u201d Fantasy and sci-fi often draw inspiration from ancient Celtic, Norse, Greek and medieval European culture. Therefore, disgruntled white fans often use this knowledge to perpetuate the white nonsense that black people should not exist in these universes.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuch fans cited this notion as evidence in their racist tirades against Idris Elba when he was cast as Heimdall in Marvel\u2019s Thor. \u201cBut Thor is based on Norse mythology, so Heimdall can\u2019t be black,\u201d they cried, as hot, salty white tears streamed down their faces. Their imaginations could stretch for alien attacks, a man with a magic hammer and interdimensional travel, yet could not encompass a black man playing a make-believe character.\n\nAnother reason this racial disparity in fantasy and sci-fi media and literature exists is that black people are often not thought of as a target audience for these tales. This fallacy has been promoted so aggressively that we have started to believe it, teasing those among us who are interested in magic and mythical creatures by calling these black folks white. However, this fallacy is exactly that: a fallacy.\n\nPlatforms like Black Nerd Problems and Black Girl Nerds have built their empires on black fantasy audiences. The hashtags #DemThrones and #ThronesYall were curated purposely for black people to engage with one another on Sunday evenings after our wigs have been snatched by the Night King. We are here, and it\u2019s time we were acknowledged.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTransformative change in the way fantasy and science fiction are immortalized on the screen could take place with an increase in black writers. According to a Color of Change study, only 35 percent of writers\u2019 rooms have at least one black writer on staff, and within that 35 percent, less than 5 percent of the writers in the rooms are black. Navigating race may be intimidating to white writers\u2014I mean, could you imagine if Marvel\u2019s Wolverine, a mutant who lived through the last two centuries, was black? The writer would have to situate him in history, which may prove difficult for someone whose ancestors were living their best lives during those times.\n\n\n\nHowever, there are much simpler approaches that white writers could use to include black people in their chronicles. Superheroes could be diversified relatively effortlessly. You\u2019re trying to tell me that Superman, a man who gets his power from the sun, isn\u2019t black? Tell that to the melanin of 1,000 generations of my ancestors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Hogwarts competes in the Tri-Wizard tournament with two other institutions of magic: Beauxbatons and Durmstrang. Either of these could have been depicted as a historically black wizardry school, especially since J.K. Rowling herself has said that magic originated in Africa. In fiction, as in reality, black people are the ghostwriters of everything wonderful.\n\n\n\nWriting whiteness is no challenge. Whiteness in fantasy just is. There\u2019s an assumption that we black people must make a case for our existence in fantasy. We are required to hype black characters, promote them endlessly and buy the characters\u2019 merchandise in order to be given more. For our obsession with T\u2019Challa, we were rewarded with a solo Black Panther flick, the HBCU of Marvel movies. In unreal worlds, just as in the real world, we live in a constant fear that if we do not make enough noise, we will be erased completely.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis eradication occurs in many forms. Occasionally, an author will choose different central figures, ornately depicting people of color as main characters. However, when these novels are made into major motion pictures or television series, Hollywood\u2019s overwhelming whiteness arrives like a storm to rain on our parade. Roles written for us become whitewashed.\n\nIn both The Girl With All the Gifts and Avatar: The Last Airbender, white actors and actresses were cast as protagonists whom the author explicitly described as people of color. In other circumstances, roles written for us are diminished. The Hunger Games had several phenomenal black characters in print, but on-screen they were weak, diluted and allotted minimal screen time.\n\n\n\nSomehow, our experience, our struggle, our story, makes its way into every fantasy and sci-fi novel, television show and film, but we are nowhere to be found.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe most ironic part of all of this is that while fantasy and sci-fi fail to produce meaningful black characters, the plots seem to echo the black experience. In X-Men, mutants face marginalization, violent hate crimes and structural policies created to impede the upward mobility of their community. Even main characters Magneto\u2019s and Charles \u201cProfessor X\u201d Xavier\u2019s crusades for mutant rights seem eerily familiar. The militant Magneto is often painted as a villain because he aims to achieve power and opportunities for mutants \u201cby any means necessary.\u201d Professor X\u2019s nonviolent approach stresses educating and reconciling with humans as an agent of change\u2014which is often referred to as \u201cXavier\u2019s dream.\u201d Does this conjure visions of Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X? It should. It\u2019s a shame it did not conjure more roles for people of color.\n\nThis parallel is not unique. The Planet of the Apes series invokes an Exodus-like liberation of apes from enslavement and persecution, yet the few humans (both ape allies and oppressors) who do appear in the movie are white. In the Harry Potter series, Hermione is a member of a community of witches and wizards who lack a purely magical lineage. These individuals, derogatorily classified as \u201cmudbloods,\u201d are frequent targets of harassment and bigotry.\n\nWhile reading Rowling\u2019s famous series, I always took Hermione\u2019s curly hair, ancestry and bouts of intelligent sass as signs that she was, no doubt, a sister who, in her free time, could be found leading Hogwarts\u2019 Black Student Union meetings, organizing #WeTooAreHogwarts movements and resisting pure-blood supremacy (by the Trumps\u2014I mean the Malfoys). Yet when she came to the screen, she was as white as snow.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSomehow, our experience, our struggle, our story, makes its way into every fantasy and sci-fi novel, television show and film, but we are nowhere to be found. We are there in the minute details, there in the theory, but never there in reality. For even in imaginary tales, our narrative matters, but we don\u2019t. We remain invisible and unworthy in both this world and the ones created in others\u2019 minds.\n\nJust because the world is magic doesn\u2019t mean we aren\u2019t real. What is real, however, is the pain felt when dark faces watch screens, searching to identify with someone, anyone, and find nothing.\n\n\n\nAshley Nkadi loves God, her mama, being black, Gucci Mane, cheese, potatoes and eyebrow maintenance.

I, for one, can think of no more dynamic combination that a person might be. ... And that is why I say to you that, though it be a thrilling and marvelous thing to be merely young and gifted in such times, it is doubly so, doubly dynamic\u2014to be young, gifted and black.\n\nWriter and playwright Lorraine Hansberry was just shy of her 34th birthday when she said these words, part of a speech titled \u201cThe Nation Needs Your Gifts,\u201d to the winners of the Reader\u2019s Digest/United Negro College Fund creative-writing contest on May 1, 1964. She would not live to see her 35th birthday, tragically dying of pancreatic cancer on Jan. 12, 1965.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHansberry\u2019s brief but remarkable life is the subject of Sighted Eyes/Feeling Heart, a gorgeous new documentary debuting tonight on the series American Masters on PBS. The title is derived from a quote of Hansberry\u2019s about the activism that in large part inspired her artistry:\n\nOne cannot live with sighted eyes and feeling heart and not know or react to the miseries which afflict this world.\n\nThe Glow Up had the opportunity to speak with Tracy Heather Strain, director of Sighted Eyes/Feeling Heart, about the journey that led her to tell the story of the first black woman to write a play performed on Broadway (A Raisin in the Sun). For her, the journey began 40 years ago, when her grandmother took her to see a production of To Be Young, Gifted and Black.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think everybody who encounters Lorraine Hansberry\u2019s words is really taken by her,\u201d Strain recalls. \u201cBut I think that if you\u2019re a young black woman and you haven\u2019t heard a lot of young black voices that were so strong and clear about what was good about society, what was bad about society\u2014racism, sexism, class issues\u2014she\u2019s so powerful.\u201d\n\nDirector Tracy Heather Strain on Sighted Eyes/Feeling Heart (Now Magazine/YouTube)\n\nBut while Strain\u2019s interest in Hansberry began in her teens, her route to filmmaking was less direct. Heeding Spike Lee\u2019s early call to \u201cmake black film,\u201d she bravely abandoned a career in advertising and direct marketing for an entry-level position at a production company.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAround the same time, Strain attended a 1989 Boston production of Hansberry\u2019s final work, Les Blancs, and fortuitously met Hansberry\u2019s ex-husband and executor of her estate, fellow writer Robert Nemiroff. Having worked up the courage to suggest to him that there should be a documentary about Hansberry, Nemiroff told Strain that he had every intention of doing exactly that; having granted film producer Chiz Schultz exclusive access to the Hansberry material.\n\nBut Nemiroff\u2019s death in 1991 understandably stalled the project, which then remained dormant for more than a decade. Meanwhile, Strain progressed on her path to becoming a seasoned filmmaker, producer, director and writer. When Schultz began looking for a director to revive the concept, he was introduced to Strain. And she was more than ready to take it on.\n\n\u201cWe officially count the beginning of this project as 2004, so we say it\u2019s a 14-year journey. But for me personally, Hansberry\u2019s been in my head for a lot longer,\u201d she explains.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe result is a truly beautiful two-hour tribute to an artist and activist who was well ahead of her time. Through interviews with contemporaries and friends like Harry Belafonte, Ruby Dee, Sidney Poitier and Amiri Baraka (formerly LeRoi Jones); coupled with Hansberry\u2019s own writings, narrated by actresses LaTanya Richardson Jackson and Anika Noni Rose (who voices Hansberry), we are introduced to a complex, deeply intuitive woman whose commitment to her work was paralleled only by her devotion to her race.\n\nWhat is perhaps most striking is how relevant Hansberry\u2019s work remains, over 50 years after her death. It is now especially poignant in an America that seems to equate making itself \u201cgreat again\u201d with catapulting us back to Jim Crow (at least). In Hansberry\u2019s own words:\n\nThe problem is we have to find some way with these dialogues to show and to encourage the white liberal to stop being a liberal and become an American radical. ... The basic organization of American society is the thing that has Negroes in the situation that they are in, and never let us lose sight of it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStrain agrees, admitting that despite the long road it took to get Hansberry\u2019s story onto the screen, her legacy hasn\u2019t diminished in the intervening years:\n\nI think that the underlying issues haven\u2019t really changed in our society for African-American lives. ... When we were trying to raise money for this, it was kind of frustrating for us that people were not getting that these words were relevant to the time. ... In 2004, you could see that her words were relevant. I think now, [with] it coming out at this particular moment in history, they seem more relevant and prescient and urgent. And I think while on the one hand, I wish it hadn\u2019t taken so long to make this film, I do think this film is coming out at the right moment.\n\nIn many ways, Hansberry\u2019s story may be even more relevant now, as it is finally a moment in time when it can be told in full. As a creative wrestling with sexual identity in addition to race and gender, Hansberry was a true example of radical intersectionality at a moment when the language to support her didn\u2019t yet exist. For Strain, it\u2019s most important that viewers come away with an understanding and respect for Hansberry\u2019s humanity, beyond the attributes that rightfully qualify her as a black American heroine.\n\nI think it\u2019s really important for people\u2014especially young people\u2014to understand how the person got to be in that revered position. What are the steps? Life\u2019s hard; being an artist, being a creative person, is usually a challenge for most people. And for Lorraine Hansberry, it was no exception. And so, I think it\u2019s important, especially for young people, to see fully complex human beings. ... And so, I hope that young people are inspired to think that getting an education and knowing your stuff is part of our history, too. It is not just somebody else\u2019s history. And I hope that with this film, anyone who [is] struggling with or juggling [their] identities, to know that they\u2019re not alone. Lorraine Hansberry wrestled with that. And then, finally, activism. You know, we have to all figure out how to contribute to making the change that we want to see. How do we make our society live up to its ideals? And I think Lorraine is a fitting figure to empower people to start wrestling with how they\u2019re going to do that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmerican Masters\u2019 Lorraine Hansberry: Sighted Eyes/Feeling Heart premieres Friday at 9 p.m. EST on PBS.", "keywords": ["heart", "hansberry", "strain", "relevant", "legacy", "young", "hansberrys", "sighted", "look", "eyesfeeling", "think", "lorraine", "black", "loving"], "polarity": 0.1804532392894461, "subjectivity": 0.5382370503060157},

And I\u2019m proud to say that today \u2026 I\u2019ve got some good white people working for me.\n\nThe HBCU crowd went wild. Who doesn\u2019t love a feel-good story about black entrepreneurship and ownership, a story about being the employer, not the employee? For most of black-American history, we have created businesses, championed innovation and carved out spaces for ourselves like the African Methodist Episcopal Church, Black Wall Street and historically black universities.\n\n\n\nThis trend continues as today, my Instagram feed, Facebook timeline and inbox are crammed with Everest College-style pitches to start my own business and stop working for the Man at a \u201ccorporate plantation.\u201d Whether I have the skills, interest or even a business idea is irrelevant. What matters most is that I take part in a seminar, enroll in their workshop and work for \u201cmyself.\u201d\n\nOn the face of it, this is great. A good chunk of the top 1 percent earn their income by owning businesses. But is that the only way? Is that the singularly best way for black Americans to truly succeed? Is a focus on business ownership the silver bullet that will solve our community\u2019s ills once and for all?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast weekend\u2019s Dove Facebook ad suggests otherwise. The now-infamous ad is the most recent in a long line of advertisements that has people wondering, \u201cWho was in the room when this ad was given the green light?\u201d\n\nLike Dre Johnson of Black-ish, I\u2019m an ad executive who knows that my career is beyond what my great-great-great-grandparents could foresee. Just this past Friday, I presented alongside several white men, conscious that I was the only woman and the only person of color in the room. This, to me, isn\u2019t success, because my voice shouldn\u2019t be the solitary one expected to represent billions of women and people of color.\n\nDove, Shea Moisture, Pepsi and countless other global brands provide us with a steady stream of examples that highlight the necessity of a choir of black and brown voices in their boardrooms versus mere tokenism. But my voice matters, and my presence at that table serves not only my employer but all the people who will see the advertising and marketing that I help develop.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI know hundreds of people who work at corporations, but not a single one of them works for the corporation. Black people don\u2019t work for \u201cthe Man.\u201d The majority of them are working for their families, their communities and, of course, for the opportunity to take dope vacation pics for the \u2019gram.\n\nMy advertising colleagues are helping to shape an inclusive voice for brands. My friends in government are using their power to encourage legislation and policies that help the cause. Many of the corporate professionals I know are developing financial portfolios that they use to support black churches, nonprofits and organizations. A good friend of mine even parlayed his writing hobby into a career that affords him the opportunity to host black voices like myself on a platform with hundreds of thousands of monthly viewers. (Spoiler alert: You\u2019re reading on that platform now.)\n\n\n\nWe don\u2019t need to work for Dove because of the impressive benefits package and generous bonuses (although there\u2019s nothing wrong with that\u2014kids gotta eat, braces are expensive and good health care is clutch). Some of us need to work for Dove and the like because our community deserves to be better-represented.

But men and women had very different reactions, to put it lightly.\n\nMany women applauded Jay\u2019s ability to finally take up the mantle of manhood and apologize for his bad behavior; for black women especially, there seemed to be a collective \u201cThank you!\u201d He had violated the trust of Queen Bey, and that was unacceptable. In the aftermath of the release, Candice Benbow\u2019s \u201c4:43\u201d spoke to nearly every black woman I know about what it means for men to finally reckon with honesty and faithfulness\u2014or not to\u2014at the expense of the women they claim to love.\n\nHowever, men weren\u2019t collectively as gracious, and although a 4:44 syllabus created by Anthony Boynton addressed issues of toxic masculinity and manhood, the reception from some men seemed to decry Jay as a \u201csellout\u201d to women. How dare he apologize? Maybe Bey wasn\u2019t doing her \u201cjob.\u201d [Editor\u2019s note: GTFOH.]\n\nWith the appearance of writer and transgender activist Janet Mock as one of the \u201cfounding mothers\u201d in the \u201cFamily Feud\u201d video, I couldn\u2019t help wondering: What are these same men thinking about Jay now?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019ll confess that though I\u2019m a longtime fan of Jay-Z, I\u2019m not a fan of \u201cFamily Feud.\u201d Though Jay rarely has a misstep lyrically, the line \u201cLet me alone, Becky\u201d seems to completely place the blame for his affair or affairs on the infamous \u201cBecky with the good hair\u201d rather than where it squarely needs to be: at Jay-Z\u2019s billionaire feet. In my opinion, it undermines the title track (\u201c4:44\u201d), where he actually apologizes and keeps the attention solely on his fuckboy behavior. So suffice it to say that when the video for \u201cFamily Feud\u201d debuted on Dec. 29, I wasn\u2019t too interested in checking it out.\n\nBut then I thought, \u201cIt\u2019s Jay. I got to.\u201d And I\u2019m happy that I did.\n\nTo start off, the choice to open the video with a quote by James Baldwin\u2014a queer black man\u2014is subversive in its own way. But then, when we time-travel to 2050 and the council of founding mothers, among the many famous faces, we see Janet Mock.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s an interesting vibe when you watch a video intended to reveal a futuristic narrative about families feuding; I read the table of founding mothers as a collective of multihued women \u201csaving\u201d us from ourselves\u2014yet again. Some have expressed concern about the fact that there\u2019s no truly ebony woman at the table, which is an important conversation about colorism that needs to be addressed. And yet seeing Mock at the table as a fully participating part of the healing process made my masculine-of-center lesbian heart leap for joy!\n\nAs I replayed that section of the video, I wondered if Mock\u2019s inclusion was a result of Ava DuVernay\u2019s hand in the process, or was Jay giving a nod to us queer women\u2014cis and trans alike\u2014that yes, I see your womanhood? Hard to tell, but I\u2019ll take that win. Of course, that also means acknowledging the possibility of tokenism, which I\u2019m never in favor of.\n\nIn fact, one could argue that the entire video has moments that give us a wobbly understanding of futurism\u2014possibly Afro but certainly black American: a distinction that is important in the analysis of why it feels very American. For instance, the question of tokenism could also be raised when examining the inclusion of Native American actress Irene Bedard as one of the presidents in this futuristic world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I\u2019d beg to differ; for me, her appearance alongside Omari Hardwick was a reminder of the much-needed conversation that black Americans and Native Americans\u2014both of whom have been uniquely affected by colonization in the social project that is America\u2014need to have. It is important that they are sitting side by side, defending each other and having each other\u2019s backs.\n\nWith that in mind, I\u2019m going to optimistically err on the side of DuVernay\u2019s deft hand and say that tokenism isn\u2019t a part of Mock\u2019s inclusion. She belongs there because she is a woman. I hope Mock\u2019s presence among the founding mothers in this video signifies a shift away from the misogynoir and queer antagonism still present in contemporary hip-hop narratives. Maybe young men will take a note from an elder statesman and begin to understand their regressive ideologies.\n\nBut I can hardly see someone like black activists\u2019 fave Kendrick Lamar doing any work in this area. He can barely speak about cis black women in a positive manner, so I\u2019d be doubly surprised if he attempted to take on embracing queer and trans black women. I wondered as I watched this video\u2014do you have to get to almost 50 years old and out of the price range of Target runs to get some damn sense when it comes to love and womanhood?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI find it telling that embracing queer women on an album where you are finally understanding that black women aren\u2019t the cocoons in which black men find their humanity feels like the next step in an evolution toward manhood. And when it comes to toxic masculinity and its relationship to womanhood, I\u2019m interested to see if Jay will, at some point, walk us through his understanding of the humanity of queer men as well.\n\nBut the presence of Janet Mock gives me hope. Not hope of acceptance\u2014that would just be empty rhetoric and truly a pitch to tokenism of the basest form. No, I hope that her presence is an acknowledgment of the personhood of queer folks. The ongoing murders of trans women\u2014particularly those of color\u2014speak to a deep and entrenched toxic combination of internalized racism and unhealthy masculinity that continues to inhabit our communities.\n\nIt\u2019s finally time for people to recognize that the most marginalized voices in the room\u2014those of trans women of color\u2014should be centered in our conversations when we are talking about getting free. Maybe our human family can stop the feuding over gender-identity labels and start thinking more broadly about what it means to be a man or a woman or genderqueer. That said, I\u2019m not going to label this video as a catalyst for that freedom.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut I am going to call it a start.", "keywords": ["jayzs", "major", "im", "finally", "tokenism", "woman", "video", "family", "belongs", "women", "jay", "table", "feud", "seat", "queer", "trans", "men", "black", "makes", "statement"], "polarity": 0.13311459667093473, "subjectivity": 0.527593896713615},

It is a dangerous, albeit relatable, thought for many people who have experienced romantic love. Although I will not commit this thought to action, it tells me that toxic things are taking place in both my environment and the dynamic of my relationship. Thoughts are intangible, but they are far from inconsequential. It is thoughts that create presidencies and sustain toxic cultures.\n\nKeith Boykin recently wrote an article titled \u201cIn Defense of Lust\u201d as a response to an article by writer Darnell Moore titled \u201cThe Bodies of Others Are Not Mine.\u201d\n\nMoore wrote poetically about fundamental feminist truths around queer men and our objectification of one another. Moore interrogates his own habits when interacting with other men and invites gay men to do the same for themselves. The idea of his essay was to push and queer the conversation around rape culture past the heteronormative lens through which we\u2019ve been looking at it ever since the Hollywood sex scandals around Harvey Weinstein penetrated the public consciousness.\n\nBoykin\u2019s article challenges Moore\u2019s and states the case that thoughts can\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t be policed\u2014that as long as no action is being committed, there is no offense to apologize for.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a post-The Secret world, it was surprising to read words, especially from a writer, that attempted to declaw the power of thought. Boykin writes: \u201cThere\u2019s a fundamental distinction between thought and behavior, and this is what concerns me most about policing our imagination. Sexual misconduct is a serious societal problem that deserves the attention of men of all sexual orientations, but in our effort to eradicate sexual assault and rape culture, we need not rid ourselves of desire and lust.\u201d\n\nThought and behavior do not live separately; in fact, they depend on each other. Thoughts create behavior. And behaviors, practiced enough, create environments and culture.\n\nInside of spaces for queer men, patriarchal thoughts are accepted\u2014thoughts like the fantasies void of consent, like what Boykins wrote about Moore: \u201cI turn him toward the tree and enter him from behind, holding his neck down for balance and dominance.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is not just a fantasy detailing an erotic wish; this is a fantasy detailing assault\u2014shared publicly with an alarming lack of awareness of how its publishing alone could make its subject uncomfortable or unsafe.\n\nPatriarchal behavior is constantly excused and often fetishized. There are countless articles demonstrating how stereotypical toxic masculine behavior, which includes everything from exhibiting violent behaviors when mad to touching people with no consent, is preferred by a large portion of gay men. Because of this, a patriarchal culture and environment are created. And one of the symptoms of this patriarchal environment is rape culture. This is the culture that made Boykin think that expressing his more-toxic fantasies was a just rebuttal to an article about queerness and objectification.\n\nMy second thought when reading Boykin\u2019s article was how people\u2014especially those who claim a radical queer or gay politic\u2014must elevate the conversation around desire, lust and the erotic. Whom you lust over and how you lust and how you express desire for another man is not created in a vacuum; it is informed by everything you\u2019ve experienced up until that lustful moment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat Moore was pushing us to think about with his article is what informs these \u201crandom\u201d moments of dehumanizing someone who has the same gender, sexuality and race experience as oneself.\n\nMoments where black men can\u2019t engage with other black men beyond their body, face or sexuality disturb me because it reminds me of the narrative of black men\u2019s history in America. It reminds me that even between two black men, the physical appraisal of someone takes priority over a type of intellectual or nonsexual emotional engagement with each other.\n\nIt reminds me of the auction block, where black people were mules being looked over. It reminds me of the rape and castration of black men and the narrative that the sum of black men\u2019s worth is in their sexuality, their labor and their usefulness inside of the white supremacist patriarchy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo, your wet dream fantasy is not harmless. It strips black men of humanity and instead demonizes and eroticizes them beyond recognition.\n\nFinally, there was a total lack of any kind of analysis on power. As I read the cases against Harvey Weinstein as well as Bill Cosby, one common thread I found was their power to change environments\u2014to turn professional spaces into sexual ones. To transform friendly outings into dangerous, predatory moments.\n\nThe uncomfortable truth is that before a Cosby places a drug inside a martini, or before a Weinstein pulls his dick out of his pants, a sexual, erotic fantasy often occurs that involves the rapist in power and the victim submitting. They act on that fantasy and quickly change the environment from a safe moment to a dangerous, predatory moment. One\u2019s ability to do that as a man still exists, even if the one being pursued is another man. That is something to agitate, interrogate and\u2014perhaps\u2014even police.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven inside my own experiences with rape, sexual assault, harassment and molestation, it is clear that the untamed male imagination is what activated those violent moments in my life. I know transgender people who were killed because of a cisgender man\u2019s untamed imagination and his shame around it. From experience, I have undergone rape and assault because of closeted, masculine men\u2019s untamed imaginations.\n\nThe imagination is something to take seriously. Writers and intellectuals especially should know this, since so much of our work is rooted in the imagination and our ability to capture that of the public.\n\nMy boyfriend is alive, but in those toxic moments when I thought about harm and violence, I thought about what else was lurking. I found that a struggle for power and an insecurity informed by patriarchal standards lived in our relationship dynamic, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a way, Boykin is correct: Thoughts and the imagination are not things to be policed, but they are something to be examined, and in some cases, they hold hints to where the soul needs healing.

She was fine\u2014like an Asian Apollonia, but just a bit thicker, with a dynamite smile and an easy laugh. She was also the sister of a guy I worked and hung out with, and I liked her immediately.\n\n\n\nUp to that point, my dating history had been seriously spotty: I\u2019d been in love with and lost my best friend, and at the time I was kinda, sorta, maybe still dating a young woman off at boot camp. It was the middle of winter when L and her brother came through to play some board games and chill. I remember as we set up the board for a game of \u201cLife,\u201d I selected two pink pegs. She also selected two pink pegs\u2014and moved a few inches closer to me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the night progressed, she flirted harder with me as her brother got more and more pissed. While we were getting a drink from the kitchen, he told me \u201cnot to fuck with his sister.\u201d Long story short, we did\u2014and it spiraled out of control. Let\u2019s just say there\u2019s nothing like a boyfriend scorned and a str8 girl who sends you a romantic letter, then pretends she was an innocent being hotly pursued by a lesbian.\n\nLet me just take a moment to explain what I mean by \u201cstr8.\u201d I\u2019m not talking about heterosexual women who have experimented once or twice. I\u2019ve never been with a heterosexual woman who didn\u2019t explicitly say from the beginning that this was just a moment of curiosity and then we\u2019re good. I\u2019m using the term \u201cstr8\u201d because it\u2019s tongue-in-cheek\u2014these women will get in bed with you then act like they are the victims of a lesbian predator. Or they\u2019ll say, \u201cYeah, we were so drunk last night\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t go that way.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m talking about women who are sexually and emotionally manipulative with lesbians. Str8 girls are not typically out here claiming labels of bisexuality, heteroflexibility or pansexuality\u2014at least, not in public. These are women who are insecure about their own sexuality while trying to fuck with yours.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy history with str8 women is why Netflix\u2019s recent iteration of She\u2019s Gotta Have It had me tripping over the relationship between Opal Gilstrap and Nola Darling. First of all, I have to give a shoutout to Spike Lee and his crew for changing Opal from a predatory lesbian into a lesbian with her humanity intact. But I gotta call b.s. on Nola being \u201cpansexual.\u201d When the character told the audience she was taking a break from men and using Opal as a \u201cpalate cleanser,\u201d I nearly lost my shit. I\u2019ll be damned if a woman uses me (and my skills) in between stops in Penistown just so she can take a break from the drama of her man woes.\n\nGIF\n\nI get it; Nola is written as the type of chick who will turn the heads of women and men, so I\u2019m not looking at Opal completely sideways when she tries to wife her up. But Opal\u2014being an adult lesbian\u2014should know that Nola ain\u2019t the one. She\u2019s fun to Netflix and chill with\u2014and that sex scene was some decent choreography\u2014but her heart and body are really with men. And if she looks at a woman as a layover until the next dick, she\u2019s not living her pansexuality. She\u2019s a str8 girl using a social identity as a way to cover up her sloppiness. Not cool\u2014not cool at all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany lesbians have been with str8 girls. To some degree, women and girls are typically socialized to define ourselves through our relationships, and some of our strongest emotions can be connected to our relationships with our female friends. I know so many straight women whose most intimate relationships are with their sister-friends\u2014so much so that I sometimes wonder if there\u2019s something more happening there.\n\nThe well of emotions between women runs deep, so it\u2019s not surprising that when a woman comes into her sexual identity as a lesbian, her first loves are usually her female friends. And sometimes that leads to an awakening with the friend, and sometimes that means you fall for a woman who is curious but not really interested in a long-term relationship with a woman. In short: Your world gets jacked by a str8 girl. Many a young lesbian\u2019s heart has been broken by the friend who wanted to make out but then ignored you in the hallway at school or around other friends.\n\n\n\nOpal does the worst thing a lesbian can do with a str8 girl, which is engage with Nola as if she is a prospective mate and not the casual, fun, momentary fling that she is. It\u2019s the kind of cue that lets you know the people helming this project have no understanding of pansexual identity, as it reads more heteronormative fantasy than actual reality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe original Opal was symbolic of the problematic \u201chunt\u201d for heterosexual women and was rightfully labeled and critiqued as predatory by both men and other lesbians. Some of us go through that, too; internalized homophobia can often account for the attraction when we attempt to sex and wife up only str8 women. It\u2019s another level of attempting to \u201cpass\u201d in the straight world. A str8 girl is usually hyperaware that her gender presentation holds up in the heteronormative world\u2014and she\u2019s very aware of how lesbian women don\u2019t \u201cfit,\u201d straight-passing or not. Therein lies the power: access to sex but also emotional manipulation.\n\nBut for those of us who spent a number of our early years chasing heterosexual women in an effort to prove we could bed them, the \u201chunt\u201d is also an extension of the toxic masculine behavior of the men we are often surrounded by. You know, the ones who believe if a lesbian only had some good \u201cD,\u201d she\u2019d change her ways. (Nah, bruh. It doesn\u2019t work like that.)\n\nThe question really is, should a lesbian get down with\u2014or try to wife\u2014a str8 girl? For me, the answer is no, but it also depends. You have to know who you are and be comfortable with your identity as a lesbian. No matter whether you\u2019re a femme (str8 girls like you because it feels kind of fun, like Katy Perry\u2019s \u201cI Kissed a Girl\u201d), a stud (str8 girls like you \u2019cause you \u201clook kinda like a boy,\u201d but it feels kind of fun, like Katy Perry\u2019s \u201cI Kissed a Girl\u201d) or somewhere in between (str8 girls like you because you\u2019re \u201cinteresting\u201d and it feels kind of fun, like Katy Perry\u2019s \u201cI Kissed a Girl\u201d), you have to know that this woman is not going to be anything more than a fling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProtect your emotions, because one minute you\u2019ll be their sexy secret, and the next, they\u2019ll claim you\u2019re some crazy lesbian obsessed with them. And even though they may be right about your obsession, they\u2019ll never own the emotional manipulation they engaged in.\n\nBottom line: If a woman ever tells you \u201cLesbians love me,\u201d run.

The song samples her famous 1966 song \u201cFour Women,\u201d released on the Wild Is the Wind album. For those who were introduced to her through Jay-Z, I\u2019m both happy and sad: happy because at least they were introduced, and sad because that\u2019s a lot of good Nina Simone music they\u2019ve been missing out on.\n\n\u201cFour Women\u201d is one of the most powerful songs I\u2019ve ever heard in my entire life. From the piano riff that runs through the entire song, which is nothing short of heaven-sent in its perfection, to the buildup at the end to punctuate the emotions and the stories of the four women who are the essence of the song, \u201cFour Women\u201d brilliantly shares the various pain and struggles of black womanhood in America, as faced by these four black figures: Aunt Sarah, Saffronia, Sweet Thing and Peaches.\n\nAccording to an old Village Voice piece written by Thulani Davis after Simone passed away in 2003:\n\n\n\nBut it was \u201cFour Women,\u201d an instantly accessible analysis of the damning legacy of slavery, that made iconographic the real women we knew and would become. For African American women it became an anthem affirming our existence, our sanity, and our struggle to survive a culture which regards us as anti-feminine. It acknowledged the loss of childhoods among African American women, our invisibility, exploitation, defiance, and even subtly reminded that in slavery and patriarchy, your name is what they call you.\n\nAs a youth, I\u2019d heard Simone\u2019s music through my own discovery of new artists, but it (admittedly) wasn\u2019t until Kanye West sampled \u201cSinnerman\u201d for Talib Kweli\u2019s \u201cGet By\u201d in 2002 that I did a deep dive into her entire catalog. I spent a week digging into internet crates looking for every album I could find, trying to learn as much as I could.\n\nHer political messaging stood out to me particularly because of the timing and tone of a lot of her music\u2014so much was released in the heat of the civil rights movement\u2014and she didn\u2019t make any bones about her feelings over what was happening in America.\n\nFrom the Washington Post about the creation of the song \u201cMississippi Goddam\u201d:\n\nWhen Nina Simone heard about the bombing death of four young girls at the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Ala., in 1963, she famously went to her garage and tried to build a zip gun to take out her anger on someone. When her husband suggested that her music would be a more effective weapon, she wrote \u201cMississippi Goddam,\u201d a politically charged song that declared, \u201cLord have mercy on this land of mine / we all gonna get it in due time.\u201d When she released the song in 1964, it contained this curious, spoken aside: \u201cThis is a show tune, but the show hasn\u2019t been written for it yet.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFour Women\u201d follows along in that political ideology, and from the moment I first heard it, I was drawn into it. It\u2019s almost impossible not to feel something. She electrified us with her storytelling, and influenced other artists\u2014there are plays and works named in honor of the song\u2014by creating offerings that spoke to black womanhood in ways that resonated broadly, but particularly among black women.\n\nHer catalog contains so many gems that one listen through any greatest-hits compilation would whet your appetite for more. From \u201cPlease Don\u2019t Let Me Be Misunderstood\u201d to the aforementioned \u201cSinnerman\u201d and \u201cMississippi Goddam\u201d to \u201cI Put a Spell on You,\u201d you can find almost anything you\u2019re looking for from Nina Simone. She has over 30 albums for your choosing, but even among the many gems, \u201cFour Women\u201d stands out for its impact and purpose.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s why they call her Peaches, the last of the four women:", "keywords": ["introduced", "music", "moments", "perfect", "song", "heard", "simone", "released", "women", "history", "simones", "nina", "black", "mississippi"], "polarity": 0.11215200029855203, "subjectivity": 0.4679047245857591},

I loved Ms. J.\n\n\n\nI was a rascally little kid who got into constant trouble and who was visibly crushing on the girl across the street. Today we might call her my \u201cfrenemy,\u201d but back then, I just thought she was my bestie. Needless to say, I was pretty clueless.\n\nI remember one day, a couple of the neighborhood boys and I were sitting on my porch, as kids did back then in the summertime. Ms. J. was out in her yard doing what older black women do. As one of the boys\u2019 older siblings came over to the porch, he called out:\n\n\u201cHey, Ms. J.\u201d\n\nShe turned around, smiled and waved, then went back to what she was doing. I remember wishing I could have a pair of overalls like her; that I could have her swagger. She wore her long gray hair French-braided down her back while she chewed on a matchstick, and you never saw her without the hilt of her switchblade sticking out the back pocket of her overalls.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMs. J. is cool,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cMs. J. a bulldagger,\u201d the older boy hissed.\n\nI didn\u2019t know what a \u201cbulldagger\u201d was, but the way he said it made it sound bad. And I didn\u2019t want to be bad, but I knew that Ms. J. and I had a kinship. And besides, being a bulldagger didn\u2019t look too bad to me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday I identify as a butch/stud lesbian. When I mention these identities where I live and work, it\u2019s as if I\u2019m resurrecting a dinosaur. Many of the queer folk in my field and the place I live who once identified as masculine of center, butch, studs or tombois have since transitioned to trans men. As a result, I know a gang of trans men and very, very few MoC queer women. And while we could argue all day about so-called butch flight and how transphobic the concept is, the absence of butch women in the LGBTQIA conversation is glaring.\n\n\n\nThe last time I saw a black butch woman on TV was on The Wire. If you\u2019re unfamiliar, her name was Snoop (portrayed by Felicia \u201cSnoop\u201d Pearson), an integral part of Marlo\u2019s crew, and both respected and feared. She embodied the cool of butchness, as well as the toxic masculinity of the men around her. Today her closest predecessor is Young M.A., possibly one of the most skilled MCs out there\u2014but the misogyny embedded in her lyrics makes me cringe. As a femme friend said on Facebook, \u201cDegradation is not part of my erotic tool kit.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor those of us who identify as MoC, what is it about our butchness that requires us to be invested in toxic masculinity?\n\nThe Good Men Project defines toxic masculinity as \u201ca narrow and repressive description of manhood, designating manhood as defined by violence, sex, status, and aggression. It\u2019s the cultural ideal of manliness, where strength is everything while emotions are a weakness; where sex and brutality are yardsticks by which men are measured, while supposedly \u2018feminine\u2019 traits\u2014which can range from emotional vulnerability to simply not being hypersexual\u2014are the means by which your status as [a] \u2018man\u2019 can be taken away.\u201d\n\nWhen I was a baby butch, I hung with a group of guys who were all about being \u201cmen.\u201d Their behavior around me was part of their way of proving their manhood, and my behavior around them was about proving my masculinity. I was never confused about my womanhood, but I definitely knew I wasn\u2019t in the least bit feminine. So when they would call women bitches and hoes, so did I. When they would grab their crotches, so did I. When they would hold back their emotions, so would I. We were all playing at some form of manhood. I was emulating what I thought black men were, and so were they.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey also spent time trying to figure out if I\u2019d had \u201cgood-enough dick\u201d yet. Sometimes I was just one of the \u201cniggas\u201d; sometimes I was this chick that one of them could \u201chit\u201d and make straight.\n\nBut I\u2019d been learning toxic masculinity since I was a kid. My pops is an old-school player; having a daughter freaked him out. Not only was he overprotective\u2014my first date was prom, which is another story\u2014but he very much had the idea that women were dumb, naive and vulnerable prey. That was the message I got as a young girl, and that was the message that shaped my identity as a butch woman.\n\nMy own understanding of femmes was shaped by that message, as well as the friendships I had with men. Prior to fully coming out, when I dated men, I\u2019d also see them as less than men because how could any \u201creal\u201d man want to be with a woman who was damn near a dude herself?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost likely, the reason we don\u2019t often see butch/MoC women in mainstream media is that MoC lesbian bodies aren\u2019t there for the male gaze. It\u2019s too challenging for our heteropatriarchal world. Women have \u201ca place,\u201d and MoC lesbians buck that in more ways than just a sexual one.\n\nThe presence of MoC women is a very direct, almost gladiatorial challenge to the concept of masculinity. Today we are seeing in a very real way how men assert their violent ideas of masculinity, through the diverse and rapidly growing group of men who are finally being called to task for their unhealthy and illegal behaviors toward women (and men).\n\nI don\u2019t hang with that particular group of dudes anymore; I grew up and moved away. But looking back, that time in my life was about not only the formation of my butch/MoC identity, but also a deeper understanding of my blackness as a black/biracial woman.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI still kind of chuckle about my relationships with my current group of male friends. They are all social justice minded, and most would call themselves feminists or women-affirming men. And yet even knowing my identity, they\u2019ll sometimes open the door for me, talk about me having children (not that you can\u2019t give birth as a MoC woman) or remark how \u201cpretty\u201d I am when I\u2019m dressed up.\n\nHow about saying how handsome I am?\n\nThese men see my fat body with its hips, ass and boobs, and no matter how fly I look in my menswear attire, they occasionally try to pull out my chair. Some would say that men shouldn\u2019t do this for any woman\u2014femme and MoC alike\u2014and that\u2019s valid. However, for me, these behaviors often feel like their subtle way of expressing their dominance over me, in the guise of just being \u201cpolite.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat I wish for butch/MoC identities is that we are increasingly included in the conversation and projected onto the screen. Not just as a nod to dapper sensibility\u2014there\u2019s some fetishizing and body-shaming in some of these conversations\u2014but as a complicated identity that isn\u2019t out-of-date or out of step with the fluidity of queer identities. The fact is, being butch/MoC in public is sometimes a very dangerous way to live.\n\nAnd yet I can\u2019t imagine living any other way.", "keywords": ["older", "replace", "ms", "masculine", "dont", "butch", "moc", "stage", "way", "politics", "women", "thinking", "j", "progressive", "masculinity", "woman", "center", "men"], "polarity": 0.05990103050709112, "subjectivity": 0.4787477954144622},

Luckily, our editor-in-chief, Danielle Belton, was able to score tickets so that we could be there to give you our impressions of the film. (Although we\u2019re not too spoilery, if you\u2019re afraid to know too much, it might be better to see the movie first.)\n\n\n\nDanielle Belton, Editor-in-Chief\n\nFor most of Black Panther, I couldn\u2019t believe what I was watching. An African nation that was never colonized? Two black women talking to each other about their mission and not, I dunno, either not talking at all or talking about a man? Moments that went on forever where no white characters spoke, or where they were summarily chastised for speaking? Black women who were fully realized characters with agency and their own beliefs? Black men who were completely confident and actualized in their ideals, even if the viewpoints were opposing and varied? A cinematic parallel for the real-world tensions and conflicts that often exist between Africans and African Americans? Black people who were the victors and not victims? What!\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat did I just watch?\u201d was all I could think after I saw it, but in a good way\u2014but also in a sad way, in that I\u2019m 40 and a lifelong movie lover who\u2019s seen almost every clich\u00e9 in cinema; but Black Panther took clich\u00e9 and chucked it off a waterfall, making me wonder why Hollywood is so lazy and often afraid of new ideas that it took this long to see a black film like this, on this scale.\n\nBut ultimately, I want to see more. I want there to be a sequel (I\u2019d love to see where things go in Wakanda after the actions of this film), but I also want there to be more blockbuster movies that take risks and tell new stories. Lastly, I want people to respect assigned seating in theaters. One dude in our theater almost ruined the entire movie because he did not want to find his ... probably crappy ... seat. But nobody has time for this game of seat leap frog. Not today.\n\n\n\nGenetta M. Adams, Managing Editor\n\nIt\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve been this hyped for a movie. And in this age when the most eager fans can line up the night before the official opening to see a movie, I\u2019ve rarely felt the urge to be among the first paying customers to see a film\u2014until now.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the splendor and beauty of Wakanda washed over me, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about what Africa would\u2019ve looked like if it had never been invaded by colonizers. What if the continent\u2019s vast riches were never stolen and the plunder of black bodies never happened? Black Panther offers the best version of that possibility.\n\n\n\nThe eye-popping fashion was even more amazing on the big screen (and if costume designer Ruth E. Carter isn\u2019t nominated for ALL the awards, I\u2019m boycotting award shows forever). And the storyline (again, the screenplay and director Ryan Coogler better be up for ALL the awards) is so timely and relevant that I actually felt empathy for the \u201cvillain\u201d Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan).\n\n\n\nAnd though the movie is called Black Panther, it is the black women of Wakanda\u2014from the fiercest warriors of the Dora Milaje to Shuri (Letitia Wright), the brilliant scientist who develops Wakanda\u2019s tech (and delivers the funniest lines in the movie), and the calm, regal beauty of Queen Mother Ramonda (Angela Bassett)\u2014who give the movie its heart. I wish my 12-year-old self could have seen such badass black women so prominently featured in a big-budget action movie. And I know that 12-year-old black girls who see the movie today will feel inspired and empowered by these black women, and encouraged to pursue their dreams, no matter what.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLook for me in the line as I hit the theater a few more times to bask in the glorious world of Wakanda.\n\n\n\nGIF\n\nAngela Helm, Contributing Editor\n\nI was hopeful but a little bit afraid of the hype surrounding Black Panther (see Empire three years ago). I shouldn\u2019t have been. It was every single thing. Big-budget action. Drama. Comic relief. And an all-encompassing, well-lit blackness that flew off the screen and overwhelmed my senses.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere will be much said about Killmonger, a complicated character who had one of the most powerful lines of the film (I gasped when he said it, and then threw a hand in the air), but what I loved most about him was that although he graduated from the Naval Academy at 19 and went to MIT, he was still so Oakland with his gold teeth and unrepentant brilliance.\n\n\n\nThe white gaze was nonexistent. This was for us, by us and quite possibly a game changer for cinema. I cannot wait for my unborn grandchildren to see it. Wakanda forever.\n\nCorey Townsend, Weekend Social Editor\n\nOne word: FASHION! The looks that were served in Black Panther sent me into a state of euphoria. The bold patterns served as a reminder that color was indeed invented for those with melanin.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe movie also served as a reminder that the world would be lost without black women!\n\nTerrell Jermaine Starr, Senior Reporter\n\nAs soon as I stepped out of the movie theater, I was no longer in Wakanda. And that made me sad. I was forced to share an UberPool with two colonizers. I wanted to yell \u201cColonizers!\u201d and ask them for their tourist visas, but I could not. We weren\u2019t in Wakanda. Nor am I Shuri. I am joking, but I\u2019m really not.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor more than two hours, I was surrounded by blackness, consumed with a power of self and possibility I\u2019d never experienced during a film. For two hours, whiteness was not centered. I was. It was challenging to wrestle with that reality and the possibilities of such a world because I was born into a reality where whiteness is the default. My struggles, my successes, my dreams are all predicated on fending off and negotiating with whiteness. In Wakanda, whiteness negotiates with me and has few options but to comply.\n\nThat is a wonderful feeling. I have never watched a Marvel film\u2014nor am I a comics fan\u2014but that has changed. Black Panther left me with a buoyancy about what our current world strives to make impossible: a world centered in blackness, our existence. There are no bells and whistles to Wakanda. It just was. For two hours, so was I. I just was.\n\nNow I am in America, where just being is a struggle. I long for Wakanda.\n\nDanielle Young, Producer\n\nThis is my second time seeing Black Panther, and it won\u2019t be my last. My emotions are not done with this movie. It not only lives up to the epic hype but also pens the only love letter to Diasporic blackness that you\u2019ll ever need. When I got a chance to watch the movie the first time, I wrote a spoiler-free review that allowed me to dig into the black pride this movie undeniably gifts you. Watching T\u2019Challa\u2019s (Chadwick Boseman) baby sister, Shuri, bounce around her lab, brilliantly leading Wakanda\u2019s tech, made me feel like a little girl watching her new role model. Representation matters, and there\u2019s nothing quite like showing little black girls and boys that tech is a possibility for them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are just so many good parts, pieces, moments, visuals, everything, but Killmonger is another standout. Obviously, Michael B. Jordan is ribbed for our pleasure, but his portrayal of a villain is delicious. His character is so well-rounded, so wounded and almost right in his attempt to dethrone King T\u2019Challa. And having his character represent black America in the sense of longing to reach home, the Motherland, was so uncomfortably beautiful. The only thing I have left to say about Black Panther is thank you for ...\u201dcolonizer.\u201d\n\nP.J. Rickards, Video Producer\n\nI\u2019ve been taking my 12-year-old son to see superhero movies for years now. It\u2019s definitely his thing: the opening, big action scenes, the one-liners, the larger-than-life graphics and the excitement after. It hit me while watching Black Panther: We\u2019re going to share that with a movie about a black superhero, strong black characters in a remarkable, all-black world. I already felt that way after seeing the trailer, but it was a whole other thing when I got to finally experience the full movie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll I could think about was how he would react at certain parts and the discussions it could open up. And to see it with black people proud and dressed up. It reminded me a bit of the level of pride when Malcolm X came out and everyone was wearing X hats and dashikis. You could tell it was made with love by people of color for our people. It also made me hopeful that this will continue to be a regular occurrence, and even though it\u2019s a big deal for the grown-ups, the impact on young people growing up might be greater than we think.\n\nJason Johnson, Politics Editor\n\nI still don\u2019t know what the heck I saw, and I\u2019ve seen the movie three times. All I know is that I was fighting back thug tears every time Killmonger spoke, and this might\u2019ve been the first time in my life that I sat in a mostly black theater and people only made noise at the appropriate times. The other thing I know is this: it\u2019s Valentine\u2019s week and Black History Month, so if you bought us Black Panther tickets this weekend, we go together \u2026.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAshley Velez, Digital Video Producer\n\nBlack Panther made me feel so many things. I\u2019ve shouted \u201cWakanda forever!\u201d too many times to count since last night. Not only was Black Panther visually stunning\u2014from the cinematography to the lighting and costume design\u2014but the writing was also incredibly executed and engaging. It created space for film watchers to have meaningful dialogue surrounding things like generational trauma, conflicting methods of liberation, and identity throughout the Diaspora. Nothing about how these themes was presented felt forced, which is where modern films and television tend to drop the ball.\n\nI really appreciated the fact that Black Panther didn\u2019t feel like it solely revolved around T\u2019Challa\u2019s mental and physical conflicts. The bulk of the characters were elevated in sincere ways. Because of this, I was able to connect with multiple characters throughout the film. I still can\u2019t decide if I want to be Okoye (Danai Gurira), Nakia (Lupita Nyong\u2019o) or Shuri! That alone speaks to the significance of how black women were portrayed throughout the film.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOh yeah, listen to the soundtrack again after watching the movie! I appreciated it so much more!\n\n\n\nA final note: If you\u2019re a colonizer, I feel bad for you, son.\n\nPsych. No, I don\u2019t.\n\nAnne Branigin, News Fellow\n\nBefore the film, I kept thinking about how Black Panther came out almost a year after Get Out. Wakanda is in some ways the antithesis of \u201cthe sunken place.\u201d Where the latter expressed a loss of control\u2014being at the mercy of \u201cbenevolent\u201d whiteness\u2014Wakanda represents liberation and self-determination in a powerful way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy mother\u2019s country has been colonized twice: first by the Spanish, then by the U.S. Although one of our national heroes killed one of the world\u2019s greatest colonizers, Ferdinand Magellan, the enduring evidence of their actions is in our names, food, features, vocabulary. I love how Black Panther imagines a land written off as a Third World country as being, instead, a superpower\u2014a land free from colonization and subjugation. I love the questions it asks\u2014about what we could be if we got to keep the most precious parts of ourselves, and about the responsibility associated with that.\n\n", "keywords": ["love", "went", "thing", "live", "film", "opening", "women", "world", "night", "movie", "panther", "black", "wakanda", "watching", "forever"], "polarity": 0.11046091495310241, "subjectivity": 0.48518148518148513},

The year was 2005, and Riley was producing the Legends Ball at Oprah\u2019s custom-built private Santa Barbara, Calif., estate, appropriately named \u201cthe Promised Land.\u201d\n\nThis, and many equally fabulous and intimate moments like it, reflect the impact of women\u2014especially black women\u2014on Riley\u2019s life. After 30 years in television, as a producer for both Oprah\u2019s and Wendy Williams\u2019 talk shows, he is now the author of the new book That\u2019s What Friends Are For: On the Women Who Inspire Me. Riley says that our former president\u2019s words echo the feeling he has held for black women since he was \u201cin the womb.\u201d\n\nRiley\u2019s book is a tale of growing up different. His father was in the Air Force, moving his family to far-flung locales like Tokyo before eventually settling in Valdosta, Ga., in the 1970s. Growing up an oft-uprooted military brat and trying to fit in was not easy, especially as a gay child in a place and time that was not so accepting.\n\nThankfully, Riley had a mother who understood how to nourish her son\u2019s soul with outings to the opera and symphony. But while mother and son shared many conversations about culture, \u201cDon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d was still the unspoken word at home. Instead, Riley found companionship and validation in the songs and stage talents of women he admired. Listening to divas uplifted him and led him to find a path to both himself and the #BlackGirlMagic heaven he dreamed of finding. He would be their angel.\n\nWomen in the arts and entertainment were the muses from my childhood who made me feel better when I was an unsure little boy who didn\u2019t quite know how to live in his truth. These women could tear my heart out with a melody or a soliloquy in a movie, appealing to the outcast I sometimes felt like in my search for acceptance.\n\nThe black gay man\u2019s search for acceptance is a timely conversation, as evidenced by last week\u2019s controversy after Patti LaBelle revealed to Bravo TV\u2019s Andy Cohen that Luther Vandross\u2019 decision to remain closeted all of his life was so as not to disappoint his mother. It\u2019s a subject that touches Riley deeply. Although his own mother understood that her son might be gay, there was a deafening silence on the matter between the two of them. To spare her feelings, Riley chose not to come out until after his mother\u2019s death.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening now in this current political climate is a reversal of empathy,\u201d Riley says. It\u2019s the reason that he feels the timing is right for this memoir, despite print being on a sharp decline, with even celebrity-centric books struggling to make it into the hands of readers hungry for content about black life.\n\nDorpie Books, the publisher of That\u2019s What Friends Are For, is a black-owned and -operated imprint and a new model of publishing that puts the power in the hands of the audience, allowing them to crowdfund the projects they want to read. It addresses a dire need for publishers to print and promote books by authors of color\u2014one recently expressed by celebrity and new author Gabrielle Union.\n\nThis coming-of-age story features both jewels of personal wisdom and gems from the entertainment world. Riley\u2019s memories illuminate the kindness and humanity of stars from Lena Horne to Beyonc\u00e9, while bringing to light the questions and struggles of many in the LGBTQ community with tenderness and humor. In this excerpt, Riley recounts:\n\nBy high school, I had the jaded notion that there was a hard road ahead that maybe I couldn\u2019t handle, reconciling my insides to what was going on outside. I wondered if I would ever come out as a gay man. Would I continue to go the course that society wanted me to? Could I marry a woman? These were big questions I had to start asking myself while peers were taking next steps into their intimate relationships.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEventually Riley did fall in love\u2014with the friendship he perceived between Patti Labelle and Dionne Warwick while watching Sisters in the Name of Love, the 1986 AIDS fundraising concert they hosted on HBO with fellow diva Gladys Knight. What he saw between them on-screen became his real-life standard for what friends should be to one another and the good that friendship can bring into the world.\n\nIt was a crush that would become a career. \u201cBefore I knew it, there I was in the TV business, either interviewing my favorite celebrity women or producing their projects,\u201d he says.\n\nThe pages of That\u2019s What Friends Are For read like a producer\u2019s personal diary of Hollywood glitterati, filled with behind-the-scenes photos and very personal anecdotes about the strong women, from activists to athletes, who helped light his journey to both personal and professional success.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRiley\u2019s prose sparkles when he describes the \u201cenergy that comes off of Beyonc\u00e9 or Janet Jackson when I touch their hand to greet them,\u201d and he recounts so many priceless moments, like Queen Bey singing him \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d on a trip to Manila, Philippines; or the interview he landed with the Boss Miss Ross and Motown founder Berry Gordy at the opening night of Broadway\u2019s Motown the Musical. And then there are the poignant ones, like when he shared tears with Warwick over the tragic loss of her little cousin, singer Whitney Houston.\n\nAt the core of That\u2019s What Friends Are For: On the Women Who Inspire Me lies a highly personal mission: \u201cIf just one gay kid can find a spot of inspiration in this text, along with others who can give support to the LGBTQ community, my efforts will have been worth it.\u201d Because after all, that\u2019s what friends are for.\n\nThe Glow Up gift tip: Preorders of That\u2019s What Friends Are For: On the Women Who Inspire Me are available now through Dec. 22 at Dorpie Books ($35):\n\nAdvertisement", "keywords": ["bffs", "books", "gay", "legendary", "inspire", "women", "friends", "patrick", "mother", "thats", "riley", "black", "meet", "personal"], "polarity": 0.17496914121914128, "subjectivity": 0.4576360126360127},

We got to see Chinese men talking like they\u2019re auditioning for the latest blaxploitation film, and Bruce Leroy himself adopt a quiet and quirky kung-fu-master attitude.\n\n\n\nWith all of the culture swapping going on, my favorite video producer and editor from Splinter, Joon Chung, and I decided to get all dressed up in The Last Dragon fashions and chat with the man himself, Taimak\u2014who played Bruce Leroy\u2014about the thin line between appropriation and appreciation, especially when it comes to black and Asian cultures.\n\nAppropriation takes certain aspects of a culture and makes them a trend or the butt of a joke. Many cultures are inspired by others, but the biggest difference is making sure you attribute said culture and avoid pretending that you created the trend or reference. There\u2019s never been a shortage of black and Asian culture fusion.\n\nWithout kung fu culture, there would be no Wu-Tang Clan. We\u2019ve not only seen the black and Asian fusion in The Last Dragon but also, more recently, with Eddie Huang, Kung Fu Kenny (Kendrick Lamar), Jaden Smith\u2019s Neo Yokio and \u201cIt G Ma,\u201d and the list goes on and on. Black and Asian cultures appreciate each other. In fact, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon writer and producer James Schamus once said: \u201cBruce Lee was probably the greatest African-American star of the \u201970s. And that culture persists.\u201d\n\nAccording to Taimak, the movie\u2019s producer (and Motown founder) Berry Gordy wanted black folks to have a hero who wasn\u2019t a reflection of the protagonists of misogynist blaxploitation films. He wanted someone who didn\u2019t embrace violence as a default reaction. He wanted Bruce Leroy to change the narrative of black heroes. And he did. Gordy helped welcome a character who didn\u2019t fit into a particular mold or stereotype, thus finally giving people of color one thing for which we\u2019ve always asked: representation that doesn\u2019t feature us as a monolith.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCheck out the above video of Joon and me chatting it up with the ageless Taimak about appropriation, The Last Dragon and his new film, Master, a martial arts epic that takes place during the Mongolian period in ancient China. While Taimak\u2019s crowdfunding campaign has ended, fans can still catch the latest updates through his Instagram.\n\n", "keywords": ["producer", "watch", "talks", "appropriation", "film", "wanted", "video", "asian", "taimak", "cultures", "dragon", "bruce", "dragons", "appreciation", "black", "vs", "culture", "weve"], "polarity": 0.09480790043290041, "subjectivity": 0.47141323953823955},

For many of us, this statement, albeit true, often lacks the full context and explanation of how both offensive terms are still derived from white supremacy, colonization and systems of oppression that create pseudo-hierarchies within marginalized populations.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite context, it is still my truth that as black queer people, we have a real fear of the state and of our own community. However, the role that colonization plays in blacks\u2019 assimilation into white society can\u2019t be dismissed as the reason we struggle to find safety within our community. We were colonized to follow the respectable order of white society, pipelined into a system already in place as a means to our own survival. The structure of white supremacy places white hetero men above white hetero women, who are above white LGB people, who are above white transgender people. This, in most cases has been adopted by our community and used to set up a black hierarchy that places black queer lives in danger.\n\n\n\nFor black LGBTQ folks, we sit at the bottom of that pyramid in our community, with black trans women being the most oppressed group. Murders against the trans community have reached an all-time high. On Nov. 29, Brooklyn BreYanna became the 27th black trans woman to be killed this year.\n\nThis is a real problem within our communities.\n\nWith no reform around toxic masculinity\u2014and an entrenched refusal to have hard conversations that are necessary to free us all\u2014we have failed to create safe environments for trans people not only to exist but also to thrive as valuable members of society.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGiovanni Melton, 14, was recently murdered by his father for being gay. It is a story that shook black LGBTQ folks to the core, a reminder that many of us survived. This story brought home many feelings that black LGBTQ people feel as soon as they walk out the house in the morning and, in this case, before they can even get out of bed.\n\nI was sold a false narrative. I was told \u201cit gets better,\u201d as if becoming an adult would change the years of ridicule I had endured my entire life, and introduce me to a world that would be fully accepting of my gender and sex identity. At 32, I now know that I take my life in my hands when I dress a certain way, or have mannerisms not accepted by a masculine-centered society. I\u2019ve been called a faggot walking to the gym, walking to the train, on Twitter, in the comments of my articles, by people of shared melanin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI understand that it\u2019s all part of a conditioning process, which has taught us to oppress those who can\u2019t easily assimilate into whiteness. In the world we inhabit, those of us who aren\u2019t so-called respectable Negroes are always frantically trying to outrun death\u2014and too many of us lose. Those of us who cloak ourselves in the mantle of respectability are always surprised when the noose encircles their necks.\n\nDespite the lies we\u2019ve been force-fed, America has and will never see the Negro as a person worthy of respect; the condemnation of our own will inevitably hurt any chance we have of ever reaching collective freedom, a freedom that the state works to deny us on a daily basis. The state\u2019s relentless attempts to harm marginalized people using various systems of oppression, instead of one fatal blow, leads to death by a thousand paper cuts. These cuts come even harder for queer people as we deal with an intersection of identities that creates multiple oppressive systems that continue to harm us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHIV funding is being threatened because the face has become that of the black women and black gay men. Conversely, the opioid epidemic is considered a national health crisis because of the white bodies it primarily harms.\n\nApproval of gay marriage only brought about the affirmation of people living in that chosen identity, as they refuse to pass ENDA, which would protect us from job discrimination.\n\nThe socioeconomic status of queer black people leaves too many of us underpaid in positions similar to those of our white counterparts; yet even as homelessness continues to be a critical issue for those who are black and LGBTQ, it continues to largely be ignored.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is no \u201cAmerican dream\u201d that has ever envisioned black people as being a part of the narrative. And, if for one moment, we ever allow ourselves to believe in that dream, like Martin Luther King\u2019s realization in 1967\u2014one year before his assassination\u2014we eventually wake up to a nightmare.\n\nHashtag after hashtag, march after march, I am reminded that my blackness is a threat to the state and has been so since our kidnapping to these shores over 400 years ago. Mass incarceration continues to destroy black and brown families in such brutal ways that it seems impossible that our communities will ever fully recover.\n\nWith the continued radical diligence of committed activists, there will be a collective community transformation centered in the truth that #BlackLivesMatter must include those lives which fall outside the margins of heteronormative safety and acceptance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHealth care disparities and discrimination have kept our people uninsured, unhealthy and unwilling to trust a medical system built on us remaining that way. Cops, prosecutors, judges and laws continue to perpetuate an injustice system intent on killing black bodies on camera with no resulting consequences beyond GoFundMe payouts, early retirements and not guilty verdicts over and over again. The recent Michael Slager verdict may be an extraordinarily rare example of justice being served, but as Malcolm X said: \u201cIf you stick a knife in my back 9 inches and pull it out 6 inches, there\u2019s no progress. If you pull it all the way out that\u2019s not progress. Progress is healing the wound that the blow made. And they haven\u2019t even pulled the knife out much less heal the wound. They won\u2019t even admit the knife is there.\u201d\n\nNo, they still won\u2019t even admit the knife is there.\n\nThe state tells us that Korryn Gaines and Sandra Bland were too loud and had it coming, that Philando Castile did everything right but wasn\u2019t white, and that Freddie Gray apparently killed himself. Lash after lash we take as black folks from the state, but we are conditioned to believe that if we can live to 80 or 90 years old in oppression, then we had a long, wonderful life.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow envision living that life at the intersection of blackness and queerness.\n\nHaving the understanding that this is all a byproduct of white supremacy doesn\u2019t make me any less fearful of my community. However, it does make me hopeful that, with the continued radical diligence of committed activists, there will be a collective community transformation centered in the truth that #BlackLivesMatter must include those lives that fall outside the margins of heteronormative safety and acceptance.\n\n\n\nLiving in my truth as a black queer person comes with the understanding that I may also be quickening my death. For that, I know that submitting to the conditions of white supremacy is not an option, and that it\u2019s worth the fight to heal my own community\u2019s conditioning in an attempt at collective freedom.

And so it\u2019s been really successful. We have a lot of incredible girls that have gone through our programs that stay connected with us, that are now in college. Some of them are graduating [and] going into the business world now. So you know, just to see this work over this time, and to see girls that we\u2019ve literally been surrogate mothers to, in a sense, grow into these incredible young women, it\u2019s been amazing to see.\n\nTo understand the potential impact of a juggernaut like eBay joining forces with Black Girls Rock!, to date, eBay for Charity has raised nearly $810 million for participating charities, raising $84 million in 2017 alone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe auction is live until Feb. 15, and the following items and experiences are still up for grabs:\n\nBallet shoes worn and signed by Misty Copeland.\n\n\n\nVIP Experience at the 2018 Black Girls Rock!

She\u2019s constantly strategizing new ways to do the work of elevating us\u2014and hopes that more will do the same:\n\nIt\u2019s easier to do the work than we think it is. And I think that sometimes people get so caught up in the idea [that] it takes so much to start a charity or start a mentoring program. And it really just takes whatever knowledge and skill that you have, using that to empower the next person. You don\u2019t have to know everything, but you might know somebody that knows something else, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been able to do in this time of building Black Girls Rock!\u2014both the award show and the nonprofit. I\u2019ve been able to kind of tap into the community and tap into our village to help me bring this to life and help me do this work. And I think that eBay has joined our village, and I think that\u2019s the beautiful part about this partnership.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up tip: The Black Girls Rock! auction is live now through Feb. 15; Pintrill pins are available throughout the month of February.

From the moment Trump was inaugurated, we have borne witness to the ways in which his presidency has negatively affected our lives.\n\n\n\nFrom instituting a Muslim ban to emboldening and supporting white supremacists; from banning transgender people from serving in the military to ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, it\u2019s clear to anyone looking that this administration isn\u2019t acting in the best interests of marginalized communities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDaShawn Usher is on a beautiful mission to push back against Trump\u2019s dangerous agenda as the founder and executive director of the Mobilizing Our Brothers Initiative. MOBI is a series of curated connectivity events for black gay and queer men to see their holistic selves. The mission of MOBI is to cultivate black and brown gay and queer men through MOBItalks, a three-part personal- and professional-development series starting in three locations in New York City: Brooklyn, the Bronx and Harlem.\n\n\n\nThe first of those events, \u201cMOBItalks: Brooklyn,\u201d is taking place Saturday and will feature world-renowned journalist and Native Son founder Emil Wilbekin; Real World: Philly alum, philanthropist and television host Karamo Brown; and social commentator, writer and Reparations-podcast co-host Richard Brookshire.\n\n\u201cOur biggest thing is around visibility of black gay men and being unapologetic about that,\u201d Usher tells The Root. \u201cWhen you think about the absence of [an] LGBTQ page on the [White House] website, when you think about the removal of ... other previous administrative initiatives, it\u2019s almost as if this unsaid thing happened. How do we operate in an era of Trump? How do we write grants about being a gay man? This is not a time to be silent, but more of a time to be active, vocal and show more visibility.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor many gay black men, promoting the concept of visibility is a double-edged sword because it often forces those who are marginalized to be seen for the sake of empowerment. But such advocacy often fails to fully consider what visibility can mean for their personal safety. This is less of a concern for people like Usher, though. \u201cI don\u2019t think about a balance yet because we haven\u2019t always been visible. There have not always been sections in our community that have been visible, and there are many parts that have been more silent historically,\u201d he says.\n\nKaramo Brown says that MOBI is important because it will provide a space for gay black men, especially under a Trump administration, in which multiple parts of their intersectional identities are under attack.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in the South the past five months, and I didn\u2019t think white people would be as comfortable calling me a nigger as they were. Racist folks have been so emboldened to be so even more,\u201d Brown tells The Root. \u201cWe have a man tacitly giving permission [for white people] to feel the anger white people have always felt. We need MOBI\u2014where people are sharing space with each other and uplifting each other.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrown says that MOBI is also critical to show what positive holistic health can look like. \u201cIt\u2019s an initiative centered on mental health for black queer men,\u201d Brown says. \u201cAs a Christian, I believe in the power of prayer, but I also believe that God has given some of us the ability to be mental-health experts, and we should seek services as well as prayer.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Brown underscores the ways in which black queer men are negatively depicted in the media, and he wanted to help challenge that thinking by being more involved with black organizations.\n\n\u201cWhen I first finished Real World: Philly, I was only approached by white queer organizations, but there is something about coming home. I\u2019m appreciative of the LGBTQ community, but when we start talking about black and brown people, there is something different about our experience that differs from our white counterparts,\u201d says Brown. \u201cThere is something powerful about that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMOBI is not alone in its journey of empowering black gay men to speak on behalf of ourselves. There are media outlets like Slay.TV, mentorship and scholarship programs like Black, Gifted & Whole, which provides resources to black gay men enrolled in HBCUs; and Native Son, a safe space to empower black gay men and celebrate achievements in multiple fields. For Wilbekin, the founder of Native Son, MOBI is a revolutionary act.\n\n\u201cAs we\u2019re living within challenging, ignorant political times, it is important to mobilize ourselves. It is important to strengthen each other and uplift each other,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we look at DACA, the transgender U.S. military ban, we know [Trump] doesn\u2019t care. We have the power to come together in community together and finding intersections where we\u2019re marginalized and create a force and stand up against this man.

For her part, Jerkins says she \u201cstands by the book and everything I wrote in it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPutting it all out there, she said in conversation with The Glow Up, is the whole point.\n\n[Editor\u2019s note: This interview has been edited and condensed.]\n\n\n\nOn writing about having labiaplasty\u2014and other taboo subjects:\n\n\u201cI was worried about what my mother would think, what my father would think, the church in which I was raised would think. The men whom I haven\u2019t even met, I wondered what they would think\u2014would I be unattractive to them?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe whole point of the book was just to lay it all out there on the table, and not with the aim that you agree with me, but that you at least have an understanding of where I\u2019m coming from. I probably look at certain chapters where I talk about dating or where I talk about my labiaplasty, and I\u2019ll look at it and I\u2019ll still feel that reverberation\u2014like, you had to go there?\u201d\n\nOn revealing the more unflattering parts of her experiences:\n\n\u201cWriting about yourself isn\u2019t supposed to be easy. Anytime you feel nervous about writing about something, I believe that\u2019s when you know you\u2019re on the right track. ... I had to keep telling myself, \u2018Stop worrying about that invisible person and whether or not they\u2019re going to be freaked out by it or whatever. Think about the people that might read a little bit more expansively because of what you\u2019ve said. Or don\u2019t think of anybody. Write what needs to be said. What you want it to say.\u2019 That\u2019s what I had to do.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the pain of being called \u201cintimidating\u201d:\n\n\u201cThe worst thing someone can say about me in a personal sense, because I\u2019ve heard other media outlets say this about me, is that I\u2019m intimidating. Sometimes it hurts more than someone calling me a bitch or cunt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t know that as soon as they utter that word, I think about all of the times where I have been pressured, subconsciously or not, implicitly or explicitly, to shrink\u2014or be completely shut off from romantic love for the rest of my life.\n\n\u201cIt makes me feel so large and like there\u2019s no room for anyone else. \u2026 It makes me feel like they\u2019re saying, \u2018Well, there\u2019s no room for me in your life.\u2019 How can I even fit, metaphorically or figuratively, in your life, in this conversation? It\u2019s like a rejection, but it\u2019s also like, \u2018Stay the way you are.\u2019 And it\u2019s like, but if you\u2019re telling me, and so many other people are telling me this, then where does that leave me?\u201d\n\nOn receiving her first vibrator\u2014from her mother:\n\n\u201cWhen I tell you that my body was on fire\u2014I had all of this kinetic energy and my heart just got broken. I didn\u2019t know what happened. I just wanted to be touched and I wasn\u2019t getting it anywhere. There were moments when I was just waking up in the middle of the night just like, it felt crazy. And my mother was kind enough to be like, \u2018I\u2019m going to help you because, what else can I do?\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cShe knew that I was going through it. And it\u2019s a very taboo subject in Christian circles, but it helped me because it helped me to take control of my sexuality. And also it helped me to avoid situations that were not going to be healthy for me.\n\n\u201cNow that I\u2019m an adult, my mother and I have talks about men and everything like that more vividly and more explicitly. It was powerful for me because it let me know that she cared. It let me know that I could talk to her about pretty much anything. When I had my labioplasty, she was there; when my stepfather passed, she was there. There [were] so many moments when she was there.\n\n\u201cI think people have to recognize that black mothers, they aren\u2019t all the same. But in terms of my black mother, she was trying to do stuff [that] when I was younger might seem like, \u2018Oh, she\u2019s trying to make you assimilate to something.\u2019 But she just knows how the world is, and how cruel the world is to black girls.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn being progressive and Christian:\n\n\u201cI think what is important for people of color who identify as Christian to do is to divorce themselves from a white male lens. A lot of times, I\u2019ll meet Christian people and their politics aren\u2019t there. And then I\u2019ll meet people who I\u2019m really great with politically, and they\u2019re agnostic or atheist, and I\u2019m like, well. ... I think the thing for me is it takes deeper investigation on my part to say, \u2018How do I think about Christianity in a liberating sense away from a white male lens?\u2019 And that may be more self-study and less relying on preachers to tell me everything.\u201d\n\nOn how her faith influences her ambition:\n\n\u201cI have to remind myself that if it\u2019s true that what it says\u2014that God knew before I was even born; that he stitched every part of me before I was even conceived of\u2014then why am I going to deny myself? When I think of the professional endeavors ... I think back [to] getting published in the New Yorker at 23 years old. Where did I have the nerve to think [I could do] that?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen I used to teach, people, they would say, \u2018Well, how did you know you were ready? Did you say, \u201cOh, I\u2019m going to write 20 articles before I pitch there?\u201d\u2019 And I just said, \u2018I don\u2019t ask for permission in anything that I do in this world, because no one is going to just give it to me. What I can do is come to you with this opportunity that I want. Say, these are the reasons why I can do it.\u2019 And you take from that what you will.\u201d\n\nOn impostor syndrome and the audacity of being on the cover of your own book:\n\n\u201cThere was belief, but don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014when those pieces were, in fact, published, I had very terrible impostor syndrome. I\u2019m talking about looking at my byline, tracing each letter of my name with my eyes and still not believing that I wrote that. ... There were many times with this book ...with the anticipation of it all, [thinking,] \u2018How dare I think that I can write what I just wrote? Where did that type of courage come from?\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEven now, when I look at the cover of my book, I think, \u2018How dare I look so proud of my own book? How dare I even be on it?\u2019 But I think what I have to emphasize is that I\u2019ve always been afraid. I\u2019ve always been a worryful person; I just don\u2019t let it overtake the courage.\u201d\n\nOn living in an unapologetically black space:\n\n\u201cI think Harlem is the only place where I\u2019m not so hyperconscious about white people. I know that if I go to the nearest store and I got a scarf on my head, no one\u2019s going to treat me any differently. I will still be acknowledged. ...\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHarlem is different for me, because it\u2019s the only place where I\u2019m not second-guessing any type of mode of behavior that I have. Despite gentrification, I\u2019m not worried about the white person next to me. I know I\u2019m going to be acknowledged regardless of what I have on my head, what it is that I\u2019m wearing. Nobody\u2019s going to deny me proper treatment.\u201d\n\nOn growing into, and accepting, a desire to be beautiful:\n\n\u201cI think my conception of beauty happened [in] two different ways: One was when I saw Zadie Smith in person, and I was like, she looks exactly as she does in the pictures. A part of me was like, \u2018Oh my God. I\u2019m jealous! She\u2019s stunning!\u2019 And then when I got on the cover of my book, I became much more hyperaware of how I looked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI was like, it wasn\u2019t just enough for me to be a great writer, which is what I strive to be all the time. But I wanted people to say that \u2018she\u2019s beautiful\u2019 as well, because that\u2019s the culture we live in. And also because I\u2019ve denied myself acknowledgment of my beauty.\n\n\u201cI feel empowered putting on a bold lipstick. I feel empowered when I try on a new eye shadow in a color that I never thought that I would really like, to be able to indulge in that way, because I never really did that for myself. And if someone acknowledges that attention that I spend on myself, then so be it. It makes me feel good!\n\n\u201cAnd I want to be able to say that with confidence and not think that is, you know, that\u2019s going to be detrimental to my art. Because this is such a personal book, that\u2019s why I\u2019m like\u2014I think that I\u2019m noticing the relationship. It definitely kicked into heavy gear when I was on the cover of my own book.

So, of course, when New York Fashion Week and Black Panther premiere week collided Monday night, there was a presentation inspired by Oscar winner Ruth E. Carter\u2019s costumes from the film.\n\n\n\nThe \u201cWelcome to Wakanda\u201d fashion presentation had guests lined up around West 12th Street in New York City dressed in their most regal Ankara couture to get inside Industria Studios, the fashion-centric studio space and event venue where designs from Chromat, Cushnie et Ochs, Fear of God, Ikir\u00e9 Jones, LaQuan Smith, Sophie Theallet and Tome were on display.\n\nThe immersion into Wakanda began with the walls, covered in leaves that branched out like ivy. At the entrance into the concrete jungle sat the blue Lexus LC 500 used during the film, with slashes from the Black Panther across its hood. Inside the purple-lit studio, seven stunning models posed in bespoke couture designs while standing on a moss-covered stage. Golden thrones were positioned on the stage like arrows on a compass, giving guests the hottest backdrop to flex on the \u2019gram.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Industria really transformed into Wakanda when the stars of Black Panther\u2014Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong\u2019o, Danai Gurira and Winston Duke\u2014held court on the black carpet. Mingling with guests and posing with the models inspired by their characters, the stars lit up the venue, taking laps around the stage and selfies with guests who dined on Wakanda Patties, made of chickpea and roast yam, and Cricket Tarts, made of chocolate-roasted crickets. Guests sipped signature drinks as artist and DJ Heron Preston kept the crowd\u2014and singer Elle Varner\u2014dancing till long past last call. Clearly, it\u2019s lit in Wakanda.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen the bar closed, even after the lights came up and janitors began sweeping up the floor, the crowds still didn\u2019t disperse, wanting to stay in the safe haven of black excellence just a little while longer. But with gift bags from event sponsor Redken in hand, the guests eventually shuffled off into the night, counting down the days till they can get back to the affirming space carved into existence by Black Panther.\n\n\n\nFortunately, the joy of the evening will continue on, as the seven bespoke pieces will be auctioned off by CharityBuzz to benefit the international humanitarian organization Save the Children. And the film-inspired capsule collections that were on display by shoe-and-accessories designer Brother Vellies, Black Panther jewelry and armor designer and official jeweler Douriean, and knitwear designer Josh Bennett are on sale today, Tuesday, for all the fans who want to keep the magic alive. #WakandaForever, indeed!", "keywords": ["designer", "venue", "till", "stage", "welcome", "york", "week", "panther", "black", "wakanda", "bnyfw", "guests"], "polarity": 0.10379182449494952, "subjectivity": 0.4061868686868687},

{"url": "https://www.theroot.com/a-reminder-black-queer-people-are-whole-1818521934", "title": "/a-reminder-black-queer-people-are-whole-", "text": "The Emmys were this past Sunday, and they were nothing short of black star power. From a black actor winning for the first time in decades in the drama category to a black comedian winning in a comedy series directed and written by all black people, one could say that the event was the most inclusive and representative of black people in the 69 years of the show.\n\n\n\nThe real highlight of the night came when Lena Waithe won her award for comedy writing, becoming the first black woman in the history of the Emmys to ever win in that category. What made the win so special for many was knowing that Waithe utilized elements of her own coming-out experience in co-writing the \u201cThanksgiving\u201d episode that won in that category for the show Master of None.\n\n\n\nIn her acceptance speech, Waithe not only called on the need to go beyond diversity conversation topics in entertainment, but also went on to make a special mention of her \u201cLGBTQIA family,\u201d specifically making mention of the fact that we need to be more visible and vocal about the right for LGBTQIA people to exist.\n\n\n\nThe problem?\n\n\n\nAlmost every news media outlet acknowledged her black identity first while only mentioning her queer identity as an afterthought. For folks like myself, who see both a person\u2019s queer and black identity as synonymous, I was left to wonder why media outlets often acknowledge the greatness that is, in fact, being black, but rarely acknowledge the beauty that is being both black and queer.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI remember once having a colleague who identified as both black and queer tell me that she often felt like she had to choose between her black and queer identity. She shared with me that once a white co-worker asked her if she was \u201cblack today or queer today,\u201d making it seem that her identity as a queer black cisgender woman was something that could be selected like puzzle pieces.\n\nHearing this, it made me think about the work that black scholars Jamie Washington and Vernon Wall have done around the both/and, and/or complex (pdf). Both scholars explain that often black queer people are made to feel as if they aren\u2019t whole and will have to choose one identity over another in order to feel recognized or validated in certain spaces.\n\n\n\nThe bigger issue: On most days, black queer people are often forced to live between the lines of their marginalized identity, being made to feel as if they are too black to be queer or too queer to be black. When society or media fails to recognize black identity and queer identity as being synonymous, we further marginalize their existence. As Corin Peterson stated, most queer black people will spend most of their lives never feeling completely accepted, being caught in the middle of their intersecting identities.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat I find to be even more interesting in times like these is how both media and society use the word intersectionality (pdf), coined by Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw, but will often leave out the oppressive and discriminatory ways in which we treat black people when we begin discussing one\u2019s queer identity.\n\n\n\nWhen we address Lena Waithe as just a black woman who briefly mentioned her queer identity, or tell black people that they should leave their sexuality out of public discourse, then we begin to embrace the dangerous elements of identity politics, which often add to the oppression of black queer individuals.\n\nFurther, we begin to perpetuate this idea that there is no need to recognize the intersections of black queer people\u2019s identity (specifically, black women) and that one identity takes precedence over the other. As Crenshaw stated, this leads to treating race, gender and other identity categories as \u201cvestiges of bias.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn all, we have to challenge mainstream media to start seeing black queer people as whole. Regardless of what you might believe, every person deserves the right to be seen as a full individual. We must challenge the notion that someone should have to choose between their racial and sexual identity because Audre Lorde tells us that regardless of how we identify, we are all complicated people leading complicated lives.\n\n\n\nIf we can celebrate and embrace Ellen DeGeneres fully in both her white and queer identity for all the work she has done for the LGBTQIA community, then Lena Waithe deserves to be celebrated for all the work she has done just by being visible and forthcoming about both her racial and sexual identity.", "keywords": ["waithe", "media", "woman", "reminder", "queer", "lgbtqia", "work", "need", "black", "identity", "lena"], "polarity": 0.05938654841093859, "subjectivity": 0.4797038327526132},

Some great moments deserve a sequel, and we\u2019ve therefore done some deep investigative journalism to get the details on our favorite look of Grammy night 2018.\n\nAs previously posted, Eve was our hands-down winner of this year\u2019s awards ceremony, despite not being nominated this year (sorry, Beyonc\u00e9). Thanks to our intrepid, talented and well-connected Gizmodo Media Group family (we\u2019re talking about you, Victor Amos!), we were able to get the scoop on Eve\u2019s incredible Grammys style\u2014and, most important, how to imitate it.\n\nLet\u2019s start with that gorgeous face: Makeup artist Ernesto Casillas has been working with Eve since the promotional tour for Barbershop and counts her among his favorite clients. For her Grammys look, he rose to the occasion while not even knowing what the star would be wearing, as he tells The Glow Up:\n\nFor the look, I knew right away that I wanted to keep it pretty and somewhat classic. We didn\u2019t know exactly what outfit she was going to wear up until right before she went on, so I wanted to keep the colors neutral and paint her in a way that she would feel confident and pretty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe multihyphenate added \u201cred-carpet host\u201d to her title this year, co-hosting the evening\u2019s Grammy Red Carpet Live with Entertainment Tonight\u2019s Nancy O\u2019Dell, Kevin Frazier and Keltie Knight. To make sure the star stayed stellar-looking throughout the day, Casillas had a strategy:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCasillas also wanted to make sure the focus stayed where it belonged while his star was speaking on the red carpet:\n\nEve usually likes to opt for a nude pink lip, but I knew I wanted a midtone lip, since she was wearing a suit and would be interviewing people. I wanted the mouth to also be a focus, but not too dark, either. I lined the lips with a deep berry color and filled in with a lighter, peachier shade. I used Kat Von D\u2019s \u201cLolita\u201d lipstick and some nude gloss over that.\n\nAnd lest we forget that Eve opted to wear not one, but two d\u00e9colletage-baring blazers during the evening, Casillas certainly didn\u2019t, using Gleam Body Bronzing Lotion in shade Deep Gold on her chest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd as for that mane of perfectly tousled waves Eve was rocking over her shoulder? You can thank hairstylist Angela Christine, who\u2019s been working with Eve for over seven years and also styles her for The Talk. Christine tells The Glow Up:\n\nShe\u2019s an amazing person to work with, [and] really makes the job easy. Eve loves strong and effortless, so once she chose the suit, she wanted something that felt relaxed and beautiful at the same time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that deciding on Eve\u2019s style was effortless; Christine was ready for a big chop, but the star felt otherwise. \u201cWe actually went back and forth about the hair. ... I wanted to do a shorter, edgy cut, but she was serious about keeping it long,\u201d Christine says.\n\nAnd as for that color? Christine says that she and Eve have been playing with both warm and cool tones lately, and the honey tone was actually done well in advance. The extensions actually came from Christine\u2019s own line, Conscious Curls, in a texture called Strength, which closely resembles natural hair blown out. \u201cThis [allowed] for lots of fullness and volume, which we both loved,\u201d Christine says.\n\nChristine then used a medium-barrel ceramic curling iron to achieve those gorgeous loose waves, strategically curling in opposite directions for a messier look. She then used Ouai Rose Oil and Kenra Texturizing Taffy to create even more separation and texture.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChristine\u2014who, in addition to working for The Talk, also has a salon in West Hollywood, Calif., and consults for other beauty brands\u2014is releasing a series of affirming children\u2019s books called the Pretty Curls Club.

There\u2019s never really any in between. But there is a very palpable significance in remembering, reliving and recognizing black history and respecting how far we\u2019ve come (even though 2017 mirrors the past more times than we\u2019re comfortable with).\n\nI guess that\u2019s what is so important: the mirroring of our past, reflected in our present, to keep us woke. That\u2019s what makes some (read: people suffering through white guilt) either squirm in their seats when watching this type of \u201centertainment\u201d or avoid it at all costs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Root 100 honoree Dee Rees wrote the screenplay to Mudbound with Virgil Williams, based on the book by Hillary Jordan. One of my favorite parts of Rees\u2019 version of Mudbound is how she relies on the characters\u2019 narration of their plights to carry the story along. It\u2019s as if their inner thoughts pull you in and make you a part of their world. You hear Mary J. Blige\u2019s character, Florence Jackson, speak of her son, Ronsel, whom you watch go off to fight on the front lines of World War II, and she says, \u201cI held his heartbeat in my hands\u2014\u201d Immediately you realize that you\u2019re in for something deeper than you may be ready for.\n\nWhen you think of the word \u201cmud,\u201d you\u2019re immediately surrounded by stiff, thick, filthy earth you want to stay away from. But that wasn\u2019t the case for the farmers and sharecroppers in rural Mississippi. They were surrounded by, steeped in and almost defined by the mud\u2014hence: Mudbound.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHap and Florence Jackson (Rob Morgan and Blige) are tenant farmers in Mississippi, and the land they work is purchased by a white man, Henry McAllan (Jason Clarke). This is a man who hardly has any common sense, no real business sense and an icebox where his heart used to be. He pulls his wife, Laura (Carey Mulligan), and their two daughters wherever he sees fit to move them, hoping for golden opportunities to keep his family well within their privilege. And that privilege is apparent, even though the McAllans are forced to slum it with the \u201cNegroes\u201d who work the farm.\n\nThe Jacksons represent the black family who try against all odds to make their way out of the expected. Both Hap and Florence work tirelessly to make sure their children are clothed and fed and still have the capacity to dream farther than the mud in front of them. It just hurts watching and knowing that black poverty is worlds apart from white poverty.\n\nEven when Henry moves his privileged family onto the farm, he is still above all the people who have broken their backs for that land. He and his family are allowed to walk into stores through the front door, drive miles around the farm in their cars and demand that someone else help them with their children, even though Henry\u2019s wife, Laura, is a stay-at-home mom.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHap and Florence\u2019s oldest son, Ronsel, returns from war and befriends Henry\u2019s veteran brother, Jamie (Garrett Hedlund), and that friendship continues the exposure to the narrative of inequality that frustrates you throughout the film. As a soldier, Ronsel saw the world outside of America and experienced a freedom that the land of the free couldn\u2019t and wouldn\u2019t offer up to him. It has made returning home bittersweet; he is tortured in his longing to be treated like a human being and finds camaraderie in Jamie.\n\n\n\nJamie acts as a conscience against racism. Naturally, a white savior shows up in these narratives, and I think it helps to ease white guilt, but the way Rees and Williams wrote the Jamie character shows the complicated reality of how a man is raised one way, experiences the world and then tries against all that surrounds him to show up differently than he\u2019s been taught.\n\n\n\nBut Jamie\u2019s character isn\u2019t perfect. He suffers through post-traumatic stress disorder and uses alcohol as a coping mechanism. His father, Pappy (Jonathan Banks), is the most racist villain in the movie and antagonizes everyone who isn\u2019t him\u2014even his own sons. At one point, Hap tells his son (who had to apologize for putting Pappy in his place): \u201cNo use in fighting. They just gonna win every time.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat line socked me right in my ribs! And so did this movie. While each actor gave a performance that is easily Oscar-worthy, the women of the film stuck with me. Watching Blige\u2019s character, Florence, leave her own children to attend to Laura McAllan\u2019s, and take on her husband\u2019s job when he was injured, left my face stained with tears. The experience of black women having to take nanny jobs and neglect their own children is common throughout history and even now. And somehow, those black\u2019s women\u2019s children still have to push through life without having their mothers there to help guide and rear them.\n\n\n\nIsn\u2019t there a proverb that says black women get shit done? Florence proves this. There\u2019s no job too big or too belittling for her. Everything she does is for the elevation of her family. In the 1940s, it was common for men to be the head of the household, and there was no questioning or alternatives. This is a very apparent theme in Mudbound, but it is also obvious that if the man is the head, the woman is the neck.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFlorence and Laura show how women of those times stayed silent but also had a magical quality in allowing the man to think he\u2019s making decisions, when it\u2019s really the woman\u2019s plan all along. In The Root\u2019s interview with Blige and Mulligan, they share what it took to play these seemingly meek but obviously strong female characters:\n\nThe beauty of Mudbound is that it\u2019s on Netflix (premiering Nov. 17), so you can watch at your own pace. I walked out of the controversial movie Detroit because of the repetitive torture inflicted on black bodies, but I stayed in my seat for Mudbound because Dee Rees offered something that Kathryn Bigelow couldn\u2019t: heart and storylines.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, there is lynching. Yes, the word \u201cnigger\u201d will ring in your ears. Yes, there are members of the Ku Klux Klan in this film. But there\u2019s also a story of resilience, the strength of fighting for a country that doesn\u2019t even want you in it, the stability of an unbreakable family structure and a bird\u2019s-eye view of how racism is bigger than all of us. Well done, Dee Rees.\n\n", "keywords": ["mudbound", "inequality", "exhausting", "america", "racism", "family", "rees", "women", "tale", "executed", "properly", "white", "man", "children", "florence", "black", "world"], "polarity": 0.06688253968253968, "subjectivity": 0.4630613756613757},

Her rich roots and passion for culinary arts were inspired by cooking with her grandmother at a very young age; years later, she\u2019d moonlight in the hospitality industry after earning credentials from Eastern Michigan University to be a social worker.\n\n\u201cI always worked at least two jobs, and if one of them was cooking, I was very happy,\u201d says Scott.\n\nAfter getting laid off from her position as a social worker\u2014and eventually hitting rock bottom\u2014she explored opportunities in the culinary field.\n\n\u201cI cannot say that [culinary] was really my choice; it was very organic. The only other thing I loved was food and cooking. I lost my home, car, everything\u2014that\u2019s how my first real cooking job came about. I decided to work on a major cruise line.\u201d\n\nFour years after her full-time transition into the hospitality industry, Scott enrolled in culinary school\u2014and quickly learned how complicated the business can be. An internship with the Food Network provided her initial exposure to culinary media, food styling and networking with established peers, eventually allowing her to gain culinary clients of her own.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShortly after, she pursued her master\u2019s degree in entertainment business from Full Sail University and transitioned into a career as a culinary producer: a multifaceted position that dabbles in all areas on set to run a smooth production. Her experience now includes being the culinary producer of season 2 of Bravo\u2019s hit television show Chef Roble and Company, Throwdown With Bobby Flay and the Cooking Channel.\n\nProgressing her way through a multilayered industry, she landed more exceptional positions, working alongside The Chew\u2019s Carla Hall at the Barbados Food, Wine and Rum Festival and becoming a food stylist for Michael Symon and Daphne Oz.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlossoming in the culinary industry has been a blessing, but despite her qualifications, Scott has experienced disappointment in the field she loves, being passed up for many opportunities. She explains:\n\nI vividly remember being called by the hiring manager of a major network with excitement in her voice, [calling me] the \u201cperfect candidate.\u201d I was told that I\u2019d be moving to the next round of interviews, and then I didn\u2019t get a call back. Inquiring about the follow-up, I was met with her less-than-enthusiastic\u2014almost bothered\u2014tone. The job was given to a young woman who just finished her internship\u2014she was white. That\u2019s just one example, and there are quite a few\u2014each one heartbreaking and disconcerting. The takeaway for me was that when something new or different is happening, it\u2019s always met with resistance. I always knew that it was my personal mission to end these cycles by breaking down these barriers. I later learned that like any building, there\u2019s ways to get in other than the front door; I began to curate my career, diversify my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and make myself marketable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd she did\u2014Scott is the founder of SheChef, a culinary mentorship and leadership program for aspiring women chefs and professionals.\n\nIn a male-dominated industry, chef Elle noted that food styling and culinary production are not. \u201cThese are probably two of few areas dominated by women, [but] women of color remain a minority in these areas.\u201d She cites culinary producers like like Ma\u2019at Zachary and owners of Powerhouse Productions Rochelle Brown and Sonia Armstead as excellent examples in the industry, while Rosecleer-Marie Powell and Sade Aguila are two of many slaying the food styling game.\n\nBut Scott\u2019s rise in the culinary world was interrupted by her diagnosis with stage 1C, grade 3 ovarian cancer\u2014a cancerous tumor resting on her right ovary. Enduring six rounds of chemotherapy over a five-month period and laparoscopic surgery removing her ovary and right fallopian tube, she experienced emotional and physical changes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI dealt with perpetual nausea but never once vomited, extreme fatigue and worked all about a total of eight days within that five-month period,\u201d she says. \u201cI was on a large amount of steroids, getting medication\u2014Taxol and Carboplatin\u2014intravenously and gained 23 pounds that I\u2019m still struggling to lose. I couldn\u2019t eat much unless it was salty; lost all of my hair, even my eyelashes. I had my last round of chemo at the end of January 2017.\u201d\n\nShe credited cancer with curing her of \u201cpersonal vanity\u201d and opts to spend more time being \u201cpresent,\u201d valuing life a bit more. This January will mark a year in remission, but whenever she experiences aches, pains and changes that aren\u2019t documented as side effects, she\u2019s a bit skeptical.\n\n\u201cAnyone having unattended health issues: GO TO THE DOCTOR!\u201d she urges. \u201cI feel like people of color, especially black Americans, have issues with approaching health care in this country\u2014not that I blame them one bit. As it relates to cancer and most other diseases, early detection can and possibly will save your life. Genetic testing is a new tool for detection; request it and accept it if offered. As clich\u00e9d as it sounds, stay positive. I believe healing begins in the mind and resonates through the body.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScott advises fighters and survivors to embrace their feelings\u2014good or bad. Despite others\u2019 perspectives, take as much rest as needed and do as many things you enjoy as you can. \u201cCancer is what you had or have, not who you are,\u201d she says.

And, while, no, Charlamagne didn\u2019t talk about killing trans women, Ashlee Marie Preston said that Charlamagne was the ringleader of Lil Duval\u2019s transphobic rhetoric on The Breakfast Club Friday morning.\n\nShe said there was no reason to ask the comedian about Donald Trump\u2019s ban on transgender troops serving in the military, which led to his using a transphobic slur that starts with a \u201ct.\u201d In addition, Lil Duval isn\u2019t particularly known for his insights on military policy. Breakfast Club co-host DJ Envy further exacerbated the drama by asking how Lil Duval would respond if a woman revealed that she was transgender after four months of dating. His reply that she would end up dead was one Charlamagne and crew surely expected.\n\n\u201cThey brought that up knowing he would have a reaction,\u201d said Preston, who staged an action against Charlamagne at Politicon in Pasadena, Calif., on Sunday. \u201cThey know we\u2019re in the age of pro-trans identity, of doing better and being decent people. So they still wanted to get that buzz when they were the ones making those statements directly. But they wanted to use Lil Duval as the voice for what they really wanted to say.\u201d\n\nThe Breakfast Club co-hosts defended themselves Monday morning, with Charlamagne defiantly saying, \u201cI\u2019m not apologizing for the words of Lil Duval.\u201d\n\nPreston said that\u2019s a cop-out. The co-hosts knew that asking the comedian about trans issues would evoke a controversial statement, making them equally accountable, she said. Preston, who is the first transgender editor in chief of the intersectional feminist magazine Wear Your Voice, is joining other trans activists in trying to force The Breakfast Club to confront what they say is its casual acceptance of transphobic behavior. Elle Hearns, founder and executive director of the Marsha P. Johnson Institute, started a petition to boycott The Breakfast Club. Raquel Willis started #TransFolksAreNotJokes on Saturday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn interviews with The Root, transgender activists said that they are organizing efforts to force iHeartRadio, the company that owns The Breakfast Club, to apologize. The petition organized by Hearns goes further, demanding that Charlamagne apologize for allowing a transphobic conversation to take place and that iHeartRadio cancel the show.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that any person who is born with any kind of consciousness could ever take joy in watching people be hurt,\u201d Hearns said. \u201cHe has a long history of anti-black rhetoric with black women. To watch black trans women be disrespected is to also watch black women be disrespected. And we\u2019ve seen that behavior from him many times before, which is why he, in particular, has become a target because of his unwillingness to acknowledge that he is wrong.\u201d\n\nWhat neither Charlamagne nor his co-hosts seem to understand is that the very passive tone of their conversation with Lil Duval creates a culture where violence against trans women is accepted, the activists told me. Human Rights Watch reports that 22 trans women have been killed in the United States so far in 2017, with most of them being trans women of color.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I asked if the activists would be willing to speak with Charlamagne, some of them kept that door open, citing one exception: not on his show. Giving The Breakfast Club ratings isn\u2019t something they\u2019re interested in. Besides, they say they are not very optimistic that talking to him will do that much good. Days before Lil Duval\u2019s transphobic appearance, Janet Mock spoke with the co-hosts about being transgender. A few days later, Charlamagne used her as a sexual prop for Lil Duval\u2019s sick humor by raising her name in his discussion with Duval.\n\nIn Allure, Mock spoke out against the show\u2019s treatment of her.\n\n\u201cHe was completely dismissive of that experience and allowed her to be a punch line and material for a comedian,\u201d Willis said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to put myself in that situation. If it was outside of the show, if it was a panel or a discussion between us two, I would go to an event like that and be a part of that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Lil Duval episode is about trans black women, but there is a larger, overarching issue concerning what they feel is Charlamagne\u2019s anti-black woman rhetoric, L\u2019lerr\u00e9t Ailith, communications director for Black Youth Project 100, told me. Charlamagne likes to project an image of wokeness, she said, given his support of the Black Lives Matter movement and his political engagement in the 2016 election, though he seems to fail when it comes to gender.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to continue to cape for Charlamagne and say he just needs to be educated,\u201d Ailith said. \u201cJanet Mock was just on his show. As she wrote in her article, she doesn\u2019t do Trans 101, but she did it for them. She went step by step, educating them on the basics of what it means to be a trans person very eloquently, and Charlamagne still refuses to take that lesson and incorporate it into his politics. I don\u2019t think he is really willing to relinquish himself the bigotry he internalized.\u201d\n\nIn December he sparked controversy when he tweeted that more black women need to build platforms like Tomi Lahren, the young white woman who used her time at TheBlaze to direct racist diatribes at black people for mass white supremacist consumption. He didn\u2019t help quell reactions from black women by having her on his show, either. Media executive Jamilah Lemieux and social-justice activist Amber Phillips appeared on his show in an attempt to explain why giving Lahren a platform was ill-advised.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, like clockwork, it appears to have done little good. Charlamagne continues to propagate anti-trans behavior, which is why the activists aren\u2019t backing down from their demands that his show be held accountable. Twitter users are continuing to upload videos of support to #TransFolksAreNotJokes. The #BreakfastClubBoycott petition is gaining stream, and Preston is planning further actions against The Breakfast Club this week.\n\nTrying to reason with Charlamagne\u2019s indignation is pointless, she said.\n\n\u201cThere need to be consequences.\u201d Preston said. \u201cIf we just tell people, \u2018You should be a better person and you should feel different,\u2019 what is that?

Surprise!\n\nHonestly, most research that surfaces about the harmful effects of racism leaves the majority of us unimpressed and unsurprised. It\u2019s been proved that experiencing racism is tied to stress, heart disease, pregnancy complications and probably everything else you can think of that can lead to death or a lower quality of life.\n\nThis week, researchers at King\u2019s College London released a study that links adolescent smoking habits to racial discrimination. They surveyed more than 6,500 young people from London schools at several points between ages 11 and 23 and found that those who experienced racism were up to 80 percent more likely to pick up their first cigarette by their 16th birthday. According to the study, students who reported positive relationships with family or a tie to religion were less likely to pick up smoking habits despite exposure to racial discrimination.\n\n\u201cAn important point here is that racism affects both physical and mental health outcomes,\u201d said professor Seeromani Harding, principal investigator of the study. \u201cAddressing racism is an important public health priority for young people.\u201d Researchers do note that there isn\u2019t enough data to show causation between racism and teen smoking, but the evidence does mirror recent trends in adolescent behavior.\n\n\n\nIf addressing racism as a public health priority sounds like common sense, it\u2019s probably because you\u2019re on the receiving end of racism\u2014but for folks on the other side, common sense ain\u2019t so common.\n\n", "keywords": ["smoking", "racial", "watch", "public", "racism", "young", "sense", "health", "researchers", "turning", "smokers", "teens", "study", "common"], "polarity": 0.061946386946386954, "subjectivity": 0.4582042957042957},

Instead, I\u2019m curled up with my laptop this fine Saturday afternoon, editing and writing blogs for The Glow Up.\n\nBut there\u2019s definite gratification in writing about an amazing project like the Free Black Women\u2019s Library, a growing collection of books written by black women and collected and curated by artist, librarian and avowed book lover Ola Ronke.\n\nRonke started the project after becoming involved with the #SayHerName movement in response to a spate of stories about state-sanctioned violence that harmed and killed black women.\n\n\u201cI was kind of like, \u2018OK, I want to be a part of something where black women are centered and where black women are the focus. But it\u2019s not tragic, and it\u2019s not pathological, and it doesn\u2019t feel disempowering or discouraging. ... You know, we can talk about us black women as writers and artists and filmmakers and creatives and all these different things,\u2019\u201d Ronke told The Glow Up.\n\n\u201cSo, at the same time, we can also have conversations about this violence and about these issues ... but within these conversations will be more of a position of power,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe won\u2019t feel victimized or objectified or like a stereotype, but more like witches and healers and conjurers and problem-solvers and scientists and doctors ... just kind of, like, shifting energy around the conversation that takes place where black women are the focus.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe result was a mobile library of black female-centric books, where participants are encouraged to give one and take one, all in an effort to advance black female narratives.\n\n\u201cIt was my love of books and my wanting to connect with people around black women, but in a way that felt like a celebration or an honoring or an affirming,\u201d Ronke noted.\n\nSince launching three years ago, the library has grown to approximately 900 books. It was initially primarily based on donations but is now moving into sponsorships and collaborations. It\u2019s even launched a Reading Challenge for 2018 and a reading group, which you can join here:\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis Sunday, Jan. 28, Ronke and the Free Black Women\u2019s Library will help launch MFON: Women Photographers of the African Diaspora, a crowdfunded photography book celebrating various iterations of black womanhood. The project clearly reflects the mission Ronke has begun with her library.\n\n\u201cWe are celebrating the release of the gorgeous new photography book MFON: Women Photographers of the African Diaspora,\u201d she says. \u201cThis stunning work of art features the work of 118 black women photographers from all over the world. The brilliant women behind this work are Laylah Amatullah Barrayn and Adama Delphine Fawundu, founding co-editors-in-chief, and Crystal Whaley, deputy editor.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Ronke, both the library and events like these are a necessary next step in expanding the exposure and understanding of black womanhood.\n\n\u201cBlack women are variable and expansive\u2014and, like, different\u2014and there\u2019s really no way to categorize that. Because under the umbrella of black women, we could have a black trans person, or you could have a black person who wears a weave or locs or has a low cut or is skinny or in a wheelchair, you know? And we also have stay-at-home moms and the Wall Street executive. ... There [are] just so many ways to be a black woman.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe adds, \u201cSo, that was part of it, too: just pushing back against this idea that there\u2019s one type of black woman. We\u2019re not a monolith; we\u2019re just, like, so varied. And we can be whatever it is that we want; and that, in and of itself, is awesome.\u201d\n\nThe Glow Up tip: You can support the Free Black Women\u2019s Library by donating to its Crowdrise account below.

Because for the longest time, I didn\u2019t even know if there was a story. I didn\u2019t take what had happened to me seriously.\n\nSexual harassment, unwanted sexual attention, grabby or flirtatious old men; we\u2019re taught as women to make excuses for them, especially as black women. You\u2019re supposed to be A-OK with a touch here, a squeeze there, a dirty look, or even an unwanted grab. You\u2019re supposed to laugh\u2014act grateful, even\u2014for the attention.\n\nEven if you never wanted the attention in the first place.\n\nWhat happened to me was something that was so casual, I almost didn\u2019t even consider it sexual harassment, even though it was beyond my desire.\n\n\n\nI used to work for a very popular media company, and we had a meeting that ended with a keynote speech by the living legend, the Rev. Jesse Jackson. So, of course, the conference room was packed wall-to-wall.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter Jackson\u2019s riveting and inspiring speech about the responsibility of black journalists, we all lined up to take a photo with him. One by one, we stepped up, shared a few words and thank-yous with Jackson, snapped photos and went back to our desks. Simple enough, right?\n\n\n\nI walked toward Jackson, smiling, and he smiled back at me. His eyes scanned my entire body. All of a sudden, I felt naked in my sweater and jeans. As I walked within arm\u2019s reach of him, Jackson reached out a hand and grabbed my thigh, saying, \u201cI like all of that right there!\u201d and gave my thigh a tight squeeze.\n\nI was shocked, to say the least. Even though Jackson had had his hand reached out, I had no idea that he would touch me in a sexual way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI did what most women in an uncomfortable position do: I giggled. And I continued to giggle as he pulled me in closer, stared down at my body, smiled and told me he was only kidding. The entire time, my co-worker snapped photos.\n\nCourtesy of Danielle Young Courtesy of Danielle Young Courtesy of Danielle Young Courtesy of Danielle Young Courtesy of Danielle Young Courtesy of Danielle Young Courtesy of Danielle Young 1 / 7\n\nIn many of the photos, you can see that I am visibly uncomfortable but attempting to laugh it all off. In the last photo, I am pointing to the camera, asking him if we can just take the picture.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I was finally able to pull myself away from the Rev. Jackson\u2019s grip, I was deflated. I admired this man who marched alongside the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., a man who represented our ability to overcome, a man who is really ... just a man.\n\nI reached out to a former co-worker who was in the conference room, who also had lined up to get her own photos with Jackson, and she said: \u201cI remember him being inappropriate with all the women. And I also remember you telling me that he did something more with you. And then we brushed the shit off and chalked it up to him just being a dirty old man.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut that\u2019s not enough.\n\nI personally never wanted to say anything because my situation was just a thigh grab. Barely a blip on anyone\u2019s radar, even my own. Jackson\u2019s tight grip doesn\u2019t even measure up to what any of the victims of Harvey Weinstein and others have had to endure; however, I was uncomfortable and had to swallow the lump in my throat as I stood right beside the civil rights leader.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHonestly, I think it\u2019s worth it for women to speak out against men who simply can\u2019t keep their hands to themselves. Because that\u2019s where it starts. My silence gave Jackson permission to continue grabbing at the next pair of thick thighs he liked. I\u2019m hoping that my voice does the opposite.\n\nI appreciate Lupita Nyong\u2019o for so many reasons, but when it comes to this Harvey Weinstein mess, her courage is inspiring. Nyong\u2019o shared her story with the New York Times about Weinstein\u2019s predatory ways when she was enrolled in the Yale School of Drama. Out of the 40-plus women who have spoken out about Weinstein, Nyong\u2019o is the only one who was specifically responded to by Weinstein\u2019s team in a statement to E! News:\n\nMr. Weinstein has a different recollection of the events, but believes Lupita is a brilliant actress and a major force for the industry. Last year, she sent a personal invitation to Mr. Weinstein to see her in her Broadway show Eclipsed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat did I say about people believing black women? Oh yeah, they don\u2019t.\n\nIt\u2019s no coincidence that out of all the women who spoke out, Nyong\u2019o was not only targeted, but challenged, as if her story couldn\u2019t possibly have been true or even mattered.\n\nCoupled with the embarrassment and humiliation many women feel after being sexually assaulted, black women have to worry about their story lacking credibility. And this is why we either hesitate to speak out or don\u2019t speak out at all.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA few of my co-workers saw Jackson\u2019s hand grip my thigh as it was happening, and they laughed harder than I did. Their laughter didn\u2019t feel like the same type of nervous laughter I had when my thigh was in his hand. Theirs was as if they had just heard the best joke ever. It was almost an encouragement of Jackson\u2019s behavior. I\u2019m not blaming them; I\u2019m just curious as to why most of them thought what happened was more funny than alarming. That\u2019s concerning.\n\nI think most women have to deal with unwanted sexual attention, and we just chalk it up to being a part of our lives\u2014yet another thing we have to develop a callus against.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust the other night, while I was ordering food, a man came in behind me and said, to himself, but loud enough for me to hear it, \u201cI think I\u2019mma get the chicken, but I should get one of the breasts from this side of the counter.\u201d\n\nHis laugh suggested that he thought his sexual harassment was hilarious. I left the restaurant without even completing my order. As I walked out, I heard the man say, \u201cDamn, sis, did I offend you?\u201d What do you think, genius?!\n\n\n\nMany of us grow callous and become numb to the daily wear and tear of causal, unwanted sexual attention. But there are times when the advances are so bold, the moments can\u2019t help but stick out.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBringing up the memories of a handsy Jackson also reminded me of another black man of power who rubbed me the wrong way literally.\n\nA few months ago, I went to the American Black Film Festival, and one of the interviews I landed was with John Singleton and the cast of his new show, Snowfall.\n\nThe interviews took place in a room filled with public relations executives, ABFF officials, myself and my camera crew. When I walked into the room, I heard Singleton say something, and I heard enough of it to know it was about me. But I ignored it. Thank God for my callus. I only had about four minutes to interview him, so I was in go mode.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI conducted the interview, and afterward I went over to Singleton to grab my mic and he grabbed my wrist and pulled me toward him, saying, \u201cBring that juiciness over here.\u201d\n\nHe was sitting in a director\u2019s chair, so when he pulled me, I fell forward and stopped myself by placing my hands on his legs. He then leaned forward and kissed me on my cheek. I said, \u201cOh, oh, OK,\u201d and stood up, embarrassed because everyone was definitely still in the room.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMostly, no one reacted, aside from a few seconds of laughter. A few people asked Singleton for a photo, and I didn\u2019t. He noticed. When he was about to leave the room, he asked if I wanted a picture. In order not to make it awkward, I said yes.\n\nHe grabbed me around my waist and pulled me into him, saying, \u201cOooh, I\u2019m gonna grab on tight to you.\u201d I laughed, because that\u2019s what I do when I am uncomfortable, and snapped the photo. When I posted the photo on Instagram, I admitted to his sexual advances, but I kept it light with humor. A therapist would tell me that\u2019s a defense mechanism.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor me, it was a mix of two things: the casualness of his advances and the way no one in the room reacted. I normalized it and made myself believe it was no big deal. Singleton was just being a man. Also, it\u2019s John Singleton! One of the perks of my job is that I get to meet people I\u2019ve looked up to my entire life. I am a young black woman from North Carolina. When I decided I wanted to be a journalist, I had no idea the job would lead me into places and spaces where I\u2019d connect with people I\u2019ve personally celebrated.\n\nMy family and I watched Singleton\u2019s films, and I never dreamed of meeting him, much less talking to him. It\u2019s never lost on me that I get to be in the same room with people I love and respect. Despite the disappointing feeling of the circumstances of meeting him, I can\u2019t deny the excitement and what it means to me to share that with the people who watch and support my journey.\n\nAfter Singleton and his crew left the room, I turned to a woman working for the festival and I said, \u201cDid you see that?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe said, \u201cYeah, girl. I heard he likes big girls.\u201d The woman was also \u201cof size,\u201d and told me that when she went to take a selfie with him, he kissed her on the cheek and said, \u201cI love your face! It\u2019s so soft. I want to feel your cheek on my cheek.\u201d\n\nThe woman\u2019s admission was so pedestrian, I was convinced she was simply reacting the same way many women do to unwanted sexual attention\u2014she ignored it. I tried to ignore it, but I felt weird.\n\n\n\nI left the room and then another journalist asked me about the interview, I told her about the arm pull, the \u201cjuiciness\u201d and the kiss, and she said, \u201cGirl, he\u2019s worth $50 million! You should pursue that!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI couldn\u2019t believe she was telling me to ignore my better judgment and my skin-crawling to make a man who doesn\u2019t respect boundaries my sugar daddy. I felt like I should never have said anything.\n\nI reached out again to the woman who worked for the festival to see how much more she remembered from that day, and she immediately responded, \u201cYes, I remember. I actually sent the story to my fiance. Hold on, let me screenshot it for you.\u201d (Black women always have receipts!) See the screenshot below:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe woman also added, \u201cIn my pic, he legit was rubbing his face on mine. I pushed it so far out of my mind because harassment is so normal. How can we remember every time a man treats us like a sexual object versus a colleague?\u201d\n\n\n\nThe woman remembered when he pulled me in by my waist for our selfie and said, \u201cIt was noticeably sexual. He grabbed you by the waist.\u201d\n\nEver since I was a little girl, I was warned about dirty old men, but not in a way that held them responsible\u2014it was often in a way that made sure I steered clear or that I dressed and behaved appropriately enough so as not to attract their attention. This was embedded in my brain and how I behaved throughout my life. So when the unwanted sexual attention came, and it always did, I blamed myself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut no woman should do that. I shouldn\u2019t do that. It\u2019s not my fault if a man wants to turn a professional environment into a playground of flirting, grabbing and sexual talk. I didn\u2019t ask for the attention just by existing.\n\nNo one asks for the attention by just being themselves.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: Both the Rev. Jackson and Singleton were reached out to for comments. Singleton declined to comment, but Jackson offered the following statement via his representative: \u201cAlthough Rev.

Hyacinthe is one of the hardest-hustling creatives in New York City, crafting a hybrid career out of her two greatest passions: music and fashion. By day, the stylist and CEO of Immaculate Wardrobe dresses Fortune 500 female power brokers; by night, she\u2019s DJ Soda Pop, spinning hip-hop and house at Manhattan venues like the Museum of Sex\u2014where she launches a weekly residency tonight.\n\nThe Glow Up recently caught up with the busy Bronx-born beauty to discuss her parallel creative careers and her future as a fashion DJ. The product of what she describes as a traditional Haitian-American family, Hyacinthe grew up on a steady diet of hip-hop and haute couture, influenced by three older brothers and a style-obsessed stepsister. Her own obsession with fashion began so early, she recalls cutting out and stashing Vogue spreads under her pillowcase, just so she could wear the outfits in her dreams:\n\nI remember being in school\u2014we had to list our skills, what we were good at. And the only thing I [could] think of was that I can put clothes together nicely. ... And I remember picking up\u2014it was Vibe magazine\u2014and they used to have the fashion editorials, and I saw [celebrity fashion stylist] June Ambrose. And they had this article, and I remember it led with \u201cstyle architect,\u201d and I was just like, \u201cThat\u2019s what I want to do!\u201d She was a major inspiration. ... I just saw her, and I was like, \u201cThis is what I aspire to be.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUltimately, it was a mentoring program led by image activist Michaela angela Davis that would be the conduit for bringing Hyacinthe\u2019s aspirations to fruition\u2014and would teach her a powerful lesson in asking for what you want:\n\nIt all starts with Michaela; she was running something called Salon du Shine at her house, where there\u2019d be a group of, like, 10 of us girls [getting] together in her loft in Brooklyn. And we would just talk about stuff, you know. And I remember going up to Michaela, like, \u201cCan you introduce me to June Ambrose?\u201d And she was just like, \u201cI don\u2019t know ... June is super-busy.\u201d I kid you not: A couple of days later, Michaela calls me and she says, \u201cJune is looking for an intern.\u201d... So I went to the interview\u2014June\u2019s two assistants at the time, they tore me to pieces\u2014but I wound up getting the internship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile interning for Ambrose, Hyacinthe also worked full time to put herself through the Fashion Merchandising Management program at New York City\u2019s Berkeley College. It was the beginning of a career path that her Haitian parents, unfortunately, didn\u2019t understand:\n\nMy parents\u2014although they were very loving\u2014they didn\u2019t understand the concept of me wanting to be a stylist and me being in a creative field; it was foreign to them. ... They didn\u2019t have the opportunity to dream as we do, and I think because of that, they\u2019re unable to\u2014they\u2019re in a sense blind to that. ... So I wound up having to put myself through college; I worked full time [in retail] and I did this internship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWorking for Ambrose taught Hyacinthe how the editorials she once obsessed over were created, but it was working in retail that helped her find her niche: helping busy professional women build their wardrobes.\n\nI would work with clients, and they\u2019d be like, \u201cSophia, I love working with you; you style me so well. I wish you could come dress me at home.\u201d And one day I actually got the courage to say, \u201cWell, I can.\u201d ... So this one client took me up on it, and I went to her house and started with her closet. But then she had me speak with her career coach, and that\u2019s when it really clicked: This is on another level. Like, you know, female executives really need this. And I really found the value that I could add.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIdentifying her core clientele and their unique need to possess a high-end wardrobe without having the time to curate or shop for it, Hyacinthe launched her company, Immaculate Wardrobe. The self-described \u201cwardrobe whisperer\u201d currently dresses about 20 clients, all of whom are powerful women who inspire her daily, as she explained:\n\n\n\nI work primarily with female boss bitches. These are women that are working [as] CEOs of companies, and they\u2019re also moms. ... I feel like it\u2019s really important for me to surround myself with these powerful women. And I feel like since they\u2019re at the top of their companies, not only am I empowering them, but also the women that come [into their companies] that\u2019ve just graduated from college ... to see that someone at the top of their career is not only killing it, but also killing it with style.\n\nBut while helping other women fulfill their potential, Hyacinthe also realized an opportunity to further fulfill her own. A longtime avid lover of music, she was often critical of DJs on the New York City nightclub scene. Challenged by an exasperated friend to learn for herself, she accepted his gift of a DJ class at New York\u2019s famed Rock & Soul record store. Instantly, another passion was born, along with an alter ego: DJ Soda Pop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike her styling career, Hyacinthe\u2019s growth as a DJ has been simultaneously organic and self-driven. She initially asked more-established DJs for opening slots and cultivated her own contacts and connections. It\u2019s a path that called into conflict the hip-hop-loving girl from New York\u2019s Bronx borough and the cultured style expert whom elite businesswomen entrust with their wardrobes:\n\n\n\nGrowing up in my family, I grew up listening to Reasonable Doubt, to Onyx, to Nas\u2014like, really hard music. Like, I\u2019m very feminine and girly now, but I grew up liking really hard-core rap. I\u2019ve always known that I\u2019ve had this love and passion for music, but it was, \u201cOK, Sophia, either you can pursue fashion styling or you can be a DJ.\u201d I didn\u2019t think in my mind\u2014I couldn\u2019t fathom the idea of me flourishing in both fields ... [But] to be honest with you, I can\u2019t exist with one without the other. ... I feel like they feed into each other so much, especially the route that I want to go. ... I want to be New York\u2019s new fashion DJ, and there\u2019s not enough of us brown girls up there that are actually doing it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile her dual careers may seem to be a study in contrasts, Hyacinthe approaches both spinning and styling instinctively, using unexpected textural combinations to evoke new feelings. And in the process of embracing her dual passions, her own identity fell into place.\n\nI feel like deejaying has really helped me fully come into my skin. ... Even with race: It\u2019s like before, I thought that I needed to kind of neglect my own identity to be accepted. And I know I\u2019m not the only one that feels that way; as a black woman in the fashion industry, which is predominantly white. I thought that I needed to strip some of my identity\u2014the fact that I listened to hip-hop, the fact that I loved it, the fact that I came from the Bronx\u2014I thought that I almost needed to move away from that in order for me to be seen in society as being this elegant person in fashion ... [but] I feel like once you accept yourself, they have no choice but to accept you for who you are. And I feel like deejaying has really allowed me to accept myself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up tip: If you\u2019re in the New York City area, you can catch DJ Soda Pop every Thursday night at the Museum of Sex at 233 Fifth Ave. She launches her weekly residency Thursday night with a viewing party for RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race.", "keywords": ["sophia", "double", "fashion", "life", "women", "hyacinthe", "wardrobe", "think", "inside", "night", "dressed", "really", "career", "york", "dj", "dope", "feel"], "polarity": 0.16347579051383396, "subjectivity": 0.5693305335968378},

Be ready. Your Facebook cousins ended 2017 in grand style with an argument about rings, which they will surely resurrect. An alleged Kay Jewelers ad for a $24.99 engagement ring had married and single women debating if wanting a more expensive ring made them gold diggers or not.\n\nSo before they reprise their battle royal, I want to talk about why we all should let women get engaged without telling them to lower their demands\u2014for rings or anything else.\n\n\n\nThe internet refers to women as a \u201cpick me\u201d when they seem to bend over backward to accommodate potential mates. Women with obsequious opinions on relationships aren\u2019t necessarily jockeying for a man to notice them. Sure, they might be annoying at times, but I keep my complexion clear by remembering there is someone for everyone. I simply am not here for telling other women how low they must go to find love. As bad as a \u201cpick me\u201d can look, it has nothing on a woman boasting about how cheaply she got picked for.\n\nI find it tacky when married women tell single women how their love didn\u2019t cost a thing and expect their unmarried counterparts to follow suit. Sis, I admire your struggle love, really, I do. But that doesn\u2019t have to be every woman\u2019s narrative.\n\nTheir stories try to convey that the quality of the ring doesn\u2019t determine the quality of the relationship. I applaud that. Collectively, however, the overwhelming message turns into: \u201cHe picked me for less, and you should ask for less, too.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, it\u2019s OK if some women want a ring that costs more than a Popeyes chicken bucket. But single women who dare express this truth hear two ugly lies about themselves:\n\n1. \u201cWomen are more concerned about the engagement ring than the marriage.\u201d\n\nHow important is a ring, anyway?\n\nWe aren\u2019t all going to agree on the answer to that question. And you know what? That\u2019s perfectly fine. You can point out that the popularity of the diamond engagement ring is the result of marketing\u2014and you would be right. If you start to unravel many traditions behind weddings, they are often rooted in misogyny or money, not romance. It is a saving grace that wedding rituals evolved over time to signify something beautiful. We fall in love with the symbolism and create our own reasons as to why it matters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA ring is merely one symbol in a social rite full of symbols: changing one\u2019s name, walking down the aisle, jumping the broom, breaking the glass. Neither the ceremony nor the traditions surrounding weddings hold much import in the actual marriage.\n\nThis is why I do not understand the vitriol and \u201cgold digger\u201d labels reserved for women who value the ring as a token of affection. It is asinine to castigate other women for adhering to one expendable nuptial custom when you probably have your own.\n\nMost women aren\u2019t more concerned about engagement rings than about their (impending or imagined) marriages. Arguments that women who give thought to their rings are \u201cfocusing on the wrong thing\u201d present a false binary. You can ask for the ring you prefer and put a lot of care into your marital relationship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. \u201cWomen should be so happy to receive a proposal; they should accept anything.\u201d\n\nFirst of all, I see a proposal as the introduction to a lifetime of partnership and work, not an honorific. Marriage is not a validation that women should be thankful to receive. But I saw one message from a woman scolding others: \u201cSomebody actually wanted you! Sit down! Be humble!\u201d\n\nI have a serious problem with people telling black women that they should be grateful anyone proposes to them at all. Black women are often cast as undesirable in the American imagination. It works a raw nerve to hear us tell one another that we are unworthy of material or emotional good.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInasmuch as we should all express gratitude for finding love in this world, it\u2019s another thing entirely to consider a proposal as a charity. \u201cBeggars can\u2019t be choosers\u201d doesn\u2019t apply here.\n\nFurthermore, a ring is a gift you\u2019re expected to wear day in and day out. What is so reprehensible about trying to find a ring a woman likes? Can we even apply the rule that \u201cit\u2019s the thought that counts\u201d if the gift reflects thoughtlessness? Any token offered without the recipient in mind is a bribe for a compliment.\n\nMost women are not arguing that a man they truly love should go bankrupt on a ring. Women want to feel consideration, and they want a ring they don\u2019t hate. If the issue is affordability, and a woman inflexibly demands something her beau can\u2019t afford, that couple has bigger fish to fry than carats.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut were we really arguing over $25 rings ... or something else?\n\nHonestly, I don\u2019t believe a conversation about \u201cungrateful\u201d women and cheap engagement rings is actually about rings at all. The unspoken contention is that (black) women are not allowed to have a floor, a preference, a bare minimum, a shred of a standard in their own love story. We are expected not to find someone who would willingly be what we desire and require, but to ask for little and be overjoyed at just enough. And apparently, \u201ctoo much\u201d is a ring over $25.\n\nThis Valentine\u2019s Day, don\u2019t be that married person lecturing singles about how your beau had nothing to offer but his undying love and twin bed. I know you gladly accepted an engagement ring fished out of a Cracker Jack box. Yes, we know your 20-year marriage is going strong, even though it didn\u2019t start out with the Rock of Gibraltar on your finger. Your examples show us that true love can thrive with less.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut love is just as beautiful when it finds us worthy of what we ask for, even if it\u2019s more.", "keywords": ["love", "engagement", "ask", "picked", "bragging", "worse", "day", "pick", "woman", "women", "rings", "ring", "telling", "thing"], "polarity": 0.1393052079933268, "subjectivity": 0.5276680690047028},

I didn\u2019t think anything of it, and then before you knew it, [co-creator and star] Aziz [Ansari] and [co-creator] Alan [Yang] called me like, \u2018So we want to turn your story into a Thanksgiving episode that\u2019s centered on Denise\u2019s own experiences. Can you write this?\u2019\u201d the writer-actress-producer tells The Root.\n\n\n\nAt the time, Waithe was consumed by a hectic schedule\u2014Showtime recently green-lit her drama The Chi\u2014and she wasn\u2019t sure she had the time to give the season 2 script the attention it deserved. But luckily, with Ansari\u2019s tenacity and support, the two knocked it out in a matter of days.\n\n\n\n\u201cI was really nervous, because this was so extremely personal and important. I needed to get it right and do it justice,\u201d she stressed.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd justice is exactly what she gave it.\n\n\n\nThroughout this hilarious and unapologetically black episode, we follow Denise through six different Thanksgivings\u2014spanning from the mid-\u201990s to 2017\u2014as she struggles to come to terms with her sexuality and come out to her conservative single mother, Catherine (played by iconic actress Angela Bassett), her aunt Joyce (scene-stealer Kym Whitley) and her Newport-smoking grandmother (Venida Evans).\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s touching, beautiful and real.\n\n\n\nHailed as \u201cbrilliant\u201d by the Washington Post, \u201cThanksgiving\u201d is truly art imitating life, stresses Waithe, down to her grandma\u2019s couch covered in plastic, her oversized basketball jerseys, and her bedroom wall plastered with posters of Jasmine Guy and Jennifer Aniston (Waithe sent the art department pictures of her childhood bedroom for inspiration).\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 33-year-old also tells The Root that the scene where she referred to herself as being \u201cLebanese\u201d because she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with the word \u201clesbian\u201d happened in real life.\n\n\n\n\u201cBeing on set and re-enacting all [my past] was such a celebration and was much easier than coming out to my mom,\u201d she says, laughing. \u201cWhen it was happening in real life, I just wanted it to be over because there is nothing scarier than that.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhile the attention to detail and authenticity definitely make this episode stand out\u2014so does the its nuanced and layered approach to addressing what it means to come out in the African-American community. Over the years, we\u2019ve been force-fed a tired lie that black folks are more homophobic than anyone else and that admitting to loved ones that you\u2019re LGBTQ can be met only with fire and brimstone.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, this episode provides an entirely different narrative.\n\n\n\n\u201cGranted, there are plenty of queer people of color that are kicked out and mistreated by their family, and I don\u2019t want to undermine their experiences. That just wasn\u2019t my experience, and it\u2019s been an honor to be able to tell a story that we haven\u2019t seen before,\u201d Waithe says.\n\n\n\nWaithe emphasizes that her mother\u2019s visceral response wasn\u2019t about God or the Bible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe went to church, but we were never religious. My mother\u2019s issues with me being a lesbian were a mix of denial, not really knowing anything about gay folks, and being this black WASP who was really worried about what the neighbors were going to think,\u201d she explains.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really complicated, and it wasn\u2019t until I was writing this and put myself in my mother\u2019s shoes did I really understand how hard it was for her to process all of this,\u201d she says. \u201cI can\u2019t fault someone for not knowing what they don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat empathy for her mother\u2014who, by the way, loves the episode\u2014is apparent with her portrayal of Catherine. While less-aware writers would have crafted her as a villainous, angry black woman, Waithe and her colleagues handle Catherine with care and nuance. In the scene where Denise comes out to Catherine at the diner, Catherine\u2019s reaction shows a mother who loves her child and wants to protect her but is clearly conflicted.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want life to be hard for you,\u201d Bassett\u2019s Catherine blurts out, fighting back tears. \u201cIt\u2019s hard enough being a black woman in this world; now you want to add something else to that?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThis conversation happened verbatim, and I see now that my mom wasn\u2019t equipped, and therefore that was her reaction\u2014but the love was always there and was always at the center,\u201d Waithe says.\n\n\n\nWaithe hopes that \u201cThanksgiving\u201d sends the much-needed message that living one\u2019s truth is a process that cannot be rushed.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI am a huge advocate for being out, but I also understand that this is a journey,\u201d she says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t just coming out to my family, but coming out myself and trying to be comfortable with my own gayness. So my advice is to do this at your own pace and your own time.\u201d\n\n\n\nWaithe also hopes that this episode will remind queer people of color how special they are and how important their lives are.\n\n\u201cYou are valid and deserve all the happiness in life,\u201d she says. \u201cSo be whoever you are, look however you want.

Blige\u2019s glow up this awards season; in fact, we\u2019re not sure we\u2019ve stanned this hard for her since What\u2019s the 411? The singer and actress has been nominated for Golden Globe, Critics Choice and Screen Actors Guild awards, and now a history-making two Oscar nods for both her performance and original song in Dee Rees\u2019 Mudbound. And she has stunned us on every single red carpet.\n\nBut those stunning looks have a secret weapon in a longtime member of Blige\u2019s team: celebrity makeup artist D\u2019Andre Michael. Knowing how much we wanted the 411 on Blige\u2019s super-fly SAG Awards look, Michael let The Glow Up in on a surprisingly low-priced secret: He exclusively used products from Black Opal.\n\nYes, THAT Black Opal (its Instagram is kind of poppin\u2019, by the way). In Michael\u2019s words:\n\nI\u2019ve been working with Mary J. Blige for years, and I love trying new looks on her. I wanted to create a showstopping look using Black Opal for her first-time appearance at the SAG Awards. Once I saw her gown, I knew I wanted to transform her into an elegant smoked goddess.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe was smokin\u2019 indeed, styled by fashion fave Law Roach in a one-shouldered black-and-white gown with a dramatic wing motif by designer Jean-Louis Sabaji.\n\nMichael, who\u2019s been on Blige\u2019s team for over a decade, complemented her dress and sleek modern hairstyle with a perfect smoky eye atop glowing skin, using Black Opal all the way. He shared with The Glow Up why, after years of working with the superstar, this awards season is such a special one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Glow Up: As a longtime member of Mary J. Blige\u2019s team, what\u2019s it like to work with her during this groundbreaking phase of her career?\n\nD\u2019Andre Michael: Having been with Mary J. Blige now for 11 years, we are more like family. I am so proud and honored to be a part of this moment with her. I\u2019m happy and overjoyed with her continued success, but this is like the stepping-stone to something I know she has been passionate [about]. It\u2019s amazing to see the acknowledgment and praise she is receiving for her work as an actress. I\u2019m like a proud brother.\n\nTGU: Mary\u2019s looks have been phenomenal at every event. How are you able to keep her looks so fresh?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDM: I have been with her every step of the way: Every award show, every red carpet, press junket, television show, etc. It\u2019s always been my thing to make her look good every time.\n\nMaybe because she\u2019s on a different platform now, a broader audience is taking note, but nothing has changed much with what we do. It\u2019s being there as a support for her in all that she\u2019s going through personally, making sure her spirits are up and she feels good about herself and comfortable with how she looks, what she\u2019s wearing, etc. So I think what shines through mostly is her \u201chappy\u201d\u2014and when you feel good internally, it shows externally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: You used exclusively Black Opal for Mary\u2019s SAG Awards look. Tell us why we should be checking for drugstore brands, and why Black Opal works so well for our tones?\n\nDM: I have never been one to follow trends or fads, mainly because trends come and go, and fads fade away. However, staying true to myself as an artist and finding things that work for me to use on my clients is most important. That\u2019s above any brand\u2014whether it is department store, drugstore or specialty store.\n\nI have learned just because something has a name brand on it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s suitable for what I need to use it for. Therefore, it is all about the quality of a product, and sometimes the most expensive product isn\u2019t necessarily the best. A lot of my favorite go-to products are drugstore brands.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy friend Sam Fine worked with Black Opal years ago and helped them with their colors and palettes. Even then, I realized It was a brand that I could trust, because he\u2019s an amazing artist that I respect and call a friend. So if Sam trusts them, I know I can.\n\nDM: Black Opal has always been a staple for having a great color range for women of color; from the fairest of women to the darkest, you could trust you are in good hands with the Black Opal brand, and the formula is great. It gives great coverage that you could work with, whether you need a light coverage to a complete coverage. The Black Opal True Color Skin Perfecting Stick Foundation is amazing! It is great to see they are still around and providing women of color and us professionals with great colors and a great formula.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTGU: At 47, Mary looks incredible. Can you talk about how makeup differs for women in her age group?\n\nDM: The only difference is probably the fads and trends you may want to stay away from with a more mature woman. In terms of looks, you definitely want to use less powder and more products that enhance a dewier look.\n\nFor eyes, most to all women can carry a smoky eye. Many think \u201csmoky eye,\u201d and they think black or dark. But you can smoke your eyes with almost any color.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn terms of skin, I like to do my concealer, then apply my foundation, next set with a powder, and maybe spritz your face with a mister or the Evian mist spray to infuse the powder and foundation. Next, let it air-dry to take away the powdered look so you have more of a dewy skin appearance.\n\nIlluminators work as well, but know that sometimes these can come across drab and chalky looking if you use the wrong color. For women of color, I recommend an illuminator in the flesh-tone range (bronzy or mauve, etc.), and stay away from pearl color or yellows or orange-based colors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, even after all that great advice, we couldn\u2019t let Michael go without getting his step-by-step for creating Blige\u2019s SAG look, and all the products he used. How else are we going to plan for our next shopping trip?\n\nFor the Face\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the Eyes\n\nTo sculpt and define Blige\u2019s eyes, Michael used the Black Opal Aurora Eyeshadow Palette. First, he used the Brazen Copper shade on her entire eyelid. Next, he added Brazen Bronze on her crease, adding the Bordeaux Beige shade along the brow bone as a highlight.\n\n\n\nMichael then finished the eye look with Black Opal Color Splurge Automatic Eye Lining Pencil in Licorice, adding it along the lash line and inner lid and smudging to create a smoky look. Note: This eye pencil is formulated with aloe vera and chamomile extracts that help to soothe the delicate eye area as you define it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Lasting Lip\n\nFor the finishing touches to Blige\u2019s look, Michael used Black Opal Lip Color Splurge Stick Lip in Purr, a soft, pale-pink color enriched with emollient butters and vitamins C&E. This lipstick provides a bright, pigment-rich color that provides a smooth, creamy, nondrying finish.\n\nNo word yet on what Blige\u2019s look will be for the 90th Academy Awards on March 4. But even after Michael works his magic, we know the finishing touch will really be Mary J. Blige\u2019s happiness. The Glow Up gang will be watching on our live Facebook group thread and rooting for her\u2014and everybody black!", "keywords": ["love", "opal", "js", "awards", "michael", "color", "sag", "look", "limit", "great", "eye", "bliges", "looks", "black", "price", "mary"], "polarity": 0.24930036777381906, "subjectivity": 0.5446655237584439},

There were no tambourines or drums, no preachers loudly proclaiming Leviticus 20:13, Romans 1 and 1 Corinthians 6:9. There were no flamboyant choir directors, teenagers named Arthur or bluesmen named Jimmy; no John or Gabriel Grimes; no Elishas.\n\nYet, this film, Moonlight, directed by Barry Jenkins, could\u2019ve been James Baldwin\u2019s, could\u2019ve been his fictional narrative. And this is because Moonlight, like Baldwin\u2019s work, is all about feeling. And in that way, like Baldwin\u2019s work, it\u2019s also, then, about blackness, religion and the failure to find sanctuary in the most ordinary, everyday, supposedly safe spaces.\n\nI don\u2019t even remember his name. I sorta remember his picture from AOL\u2014a chat room, but which one, I don\u2019t remember, either\u2014but I remember how I felt. I was experimenting, a high school senior with a college sophomore. I remember I didn\u2019t like him much, that who he was, what he said in his profile and his picture didn\u2019t match the person who showed up at my door later. But I wanted to try because I\u2019d felt so alone that I let him in anyway.\n\nI remember thinking that I\u2019d go to hell as soon as he left my parents\u2019 house.\n\n\n\nIt was around 3:50 p.m. and I walked him to my bedroom, up the creaky stairs that made too much noise. I had an hour and maybe 10 minutes. He\u2019d have to get in and get out before my parents got home. His breath stank. His Afro was asymmetrical. We barely did anything at all. I have not seen him since that first and, thus, last day. I let dude in my house because I wanted to be touched and wanted to feel wanted. I let him in my house because I was seeking connection.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m thinking about this, and so many other random encounters, because what Moonlight highlights so well is a kind of loneliness and desire that can lead to all kinds of random encounters. Random encounters that are grounded in touch. Random encounters of intense feeling include Juan (played by Mahershala Ali) reaching out and extending care to a little boy he didn\u2019t know but felt a kinship with, an affinity to. He touched Little (Alex Hibbert), held him gently in water, baptized him to life as possible.\n\n\n\nRandom encounters of intense feeling include Paula (Naomie Harris) and her addiction to crack, how she went from moods of intense love to explicit and harsh rejection of her son. She was touched, too, by Black (Trevante Rhodes) as tears streamed down her face.\n\nEverything in the film, this masterpiece, was a reach for connection.\n\nLittle, then Chiron (Ashton Sanders), then Black, at each stage of Moonlight, felt the touch of Kevin. In such touch was sanctuary and refuge, in such touch was gentleness and quiet. A kind of quiet that was softly vibrational. For Black, in Act 3 of Moonlight, it is revealed that he\u2019d not been touched since Kevin in high school. Was it just the teenage experimentation on the beach, head held in hand, hand gripping sand, he meant? Or did he also mean the violent touch on high school property, the confrontation with Kevin?\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe intimacy, discomfort, touch and feeling produced a confrontation with viewers. Would you dismiss it as a gay tale that is sinful because of what the Bible says? Would you discredit it as lacking a plot altogether because a bildungsroman of a black boy is much too much askance for you to consider it real? Or is watching the intimacy between men the occasion for memory and remembrance? The film compels visceral response to it by capturing the visceral quality of Chiron\u2019s lives.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s about discomfort that emerges in dreams that allow you to consider that other ways of existence might not only be possible, but also pleasurable; that they might bring joy against sorrow, joy unspeakable. Such unspeakable joy becomes imaginable through the discomfort of watching Little, then Chiron, then Black, with Kevin. It\u2019s about intimacy, touch, feeling.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s about the search for something so wildly and radically free that he would wait to be touched like that again.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe film also confronts viewers with a fundamental truth: Homophobia in black is not worse than its performance in other shades. The film does not allow audiences to decry the nature of blackness as the zone in which homophobia is produced. There was Juan. There was Teresa (Janelle Mon\u00e1e). There were the three Kevins. Each provided a space of reprieve and sanctuary; each provided refuge without judgment, without shaming.\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s that song that, when you hear it, makes you remember? That smell wafting from the kitchen that reminds you of Mama\u2019s cooking? That color seen that dredges up what happened that day in school so many moons ago?\n\n\n\nKevin hears a song and it forces him to recall Chiron. The sound of the song is memory for him and produces the occasion to reach out, to call, to seek reconnection, to seek touch. Moonlight is a sensual film because it uses various sense experiences\u2014taste, touch, smell, sight, hearing\u2014to be not just the path toward memory, but memory itself.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn being about sense experiences, it is about how one feels\u2014and black religiosity, its history and tradition in the so-called new world, is all about feeling.\n\nAt its best, when not colluding with white supremacist capitalist patriarchy, black religiosity allows us to learn how to love our flesh, and love it hard, in a world that does not deem blackness as loving or lovable. The characters typically would be considered sinners according to a lot of religious logics. So we have to think about the way religion is unmarked in Moonlight in ways that create the opportunity to critique the way spaces of so-called sanctuary can become spaces of violence.\n\nThis is the genius of Moonlight. The film wages battle at the level of feeling. Such feeling is often the taboo of dreams or sometimes nightmares, never to be spoken aloud, never to be admitted. You dreamed of her but are not into women. You think of him, how he sometimes hugs you on the court quickly, but in that minuscule moment your heart heats, chest heaves, but he\u2019s just a basketball buddy. It\u2019s the feeling that emerges in night terrors that makes you smile and open your heart to capaciousness, to expansiveness, to possibility.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt its best, when not colluding with white supremacist capitalist patriarchy, black religiosity allows us to learn how to love our flesh, and love it hard, in a world that does not deem blackness as loving or lovable.\n\nThe film gathers and depicts the quiet brush of soft intimacy between friends. It is an intimacy learned and produced by gesture, by deep looks, sustained grasped hands. Grabbed sand, chopped onions, slow stares, held head. But then, I guess it\u2019s also about fear, about the fear that such a connection\u2014once established\u2014cannot be sustained. So, for many of us, we just reject the possibility altogether, reject the possibility as desirous, dismiss the possibility as ridiculous. But if we remain with the film, if we open ourselves up to its visceral nature, its touch and rub, its hush and hum, it has the capacity to transform what we think imaginable. And it produces the excitement of imagination through the most ordinary and everyday of encounters, the most simple and gentle ways of existence.\n\nThankfully, winner of the Oscar awards for best picture, writing of an adapted screenplay and best supporting actor, the film yet exceeds easy categorization and framework. Moonlight is not a frivolous film. It is a film of its time, rooted in the 305, in the blackness of the Liberty Square housing project, in the complexity of character and life and love in Miami, in the freedom dreams that emerge from within the struggle with living, with touch, with desire. Moonlight is a touching film, illustrating the healing and generative force of touch between characters. And in such exchange between characters is the capacity for healing and a generative force for viewers.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is the genius of Moonlight. The film wages battle at the level of feeling.\n\nMoonlight reminds me that black life is about a life touched and held, and that there is joy therein, that the touch I have sought and still seek is one that many of us desire, and that such desire is worthy of its pursuit.\n\nAnd Moonlight reminds me that we should seek out and find delight in black life, and that this joy and delight can be found in the general spaces, the regular places. That we can desire and find touch that frees; touch that makes us remember and makes us forget; touch that holds us close until we lovingly and intentionally embrace those parts of ourselves that we dared not speak into existence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n____________________________________________\n\nAshon Crawley is assistant professor of ethnic studies at the University of California, Riverside.

The multidimensional author of A Beautiful Work in Progress has been making her way around the internet\u2014and on the pavement.\n\nRecently, she was featured in a J.C. Penney campaign with yogi Jessamyn Stanley as well as in a now-viral video with REI, where she reads an ugly email from an anonymous troll who accuses her of not being a runner because she\u2019s overweight. As director of equity and inclusion at Rabun Gap Nacoochee School, the Mirnavator\u2014a pseudonym to almost 30,000 Instagram followers\u2014wears many hats: Spanish instructor, cross-country coach and even, utilizing her Juilliard background, a chorus director; that is, when she\u2019s not beating down the trails or doing a Tough Mudder.\n\n\n\nFor those unfamiliar with her story, Valerio has consistently defied the stereotypes of what an ultrarunner looks like, while being featured by the Wall Street Journal, Runner\u2019s World, NBC Nightly News and CNN.\n\nMany have questioned if she can truly be both \u201cfat and fit\u201d while tackling courses like the Javelina Jundred and the TransRockies Run\u2014a whopping 62.13 and 120 miles, respectively. As she recounts in her book, her passion for fitness dates to her youth; but it was ultimately a health scare that gave her the jump start back into running.\n\n\u201cI was driving through the middle of Pennsylvania when I started getting chest pains, and thought I was having a heart attack,\u201d Valerio told HuffPost in October.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThankfully, it was a false alarm, but she followed up with a cardiologist who advised her to change her lifestyle or else she would die, leaving behind her son. During this period of her life, she was working around the clock, under high stress, with no relief, and not exercising. Her health scare pushed her to begin documenting her running journey with the public, sharing everything from her experiences of night running to talking about her fitness endeavors as a plus-size woman sometimes coming in DFL\u2014\u201ddead fucking last\u201d\u2014at trail races.\n\nAs a fellow runner and friend, I\u2019ve had the pleasure of celebrating an annual New Year\u2019s Day hike at Anthony\u2019s Nose with Valerio. This year, I couldn\u2019t help but ask a multitude of questions, wondering what sparked her to write her memoirs while also trying to balance her private life, teaching, training for the Boston Marathon and touring.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cActually, there is no balance; it\u2019s sort of a myth,\u201d she joked.\n\nThe boarding school where she works has been exceptionally accommodating to her ever-changing schedule, allowing her to maintain employment on a flexible schedule\u2014and allowing her teenage son to stay on campus while she tours several states.\n\nAlthough flattered by the media attention, she says she wanted to tell her own story of how she started her journey. So, since her October 2017 book launch, Merrell and REI have teamed up to help Valerio conduct a multicity sold-out book tour, allowing her to engage with thousands of people from Seattle to New York City.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdmittedly, amid the the waves of support from fans praising her astonishing accolades, she\u2019s consistently had to remind herself about self-care:\n\nWhen I was on the Rich Roll podcast, I had to put my phone down, because all day, I was getting a ton of messages and DMs on Instagram, on Twitter and all of my Facebook pages.\n\nTypically, it\u2019s questions like \u201cWow, how did you get started?\u201d But the Merrell, Skirt Sports and Swiftwick Socks ambassador noted that there are times the questions get tough. Although she strives to answer every message, she hopes that living in her truth will serve as an unspoken example for others to pursue their passions despite shape, size, disability or background:\n\nIt\u2019s cool knowing that people reach out and share themselves in that way; it may sound crass or caustic, but I cannot solve everyone\u2019s problems. I hope that through seeing and observing me through my social media accounts that they do receive the inspiration that they need to get out of whatever hold that they\u2019re in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer ambitious calendar is currently loaded with events such as a 50K with the North Face Endurance in Washington, D.C.; a 10K the following day; a host of Tough Mudders; and traveling to the Azores Island to do a trail run.\n\nLike many, I wondered if there were any other books in her future. Although there are no confirmations yet, she hinted that she will be involved in several major projects that will touch on running and beyond.\n\nSo what advice does a motivational speaker and accomplished runner offer to those who want to get themselves started in fitness?\n\nWrite down your goals first. Speak them out to the universe, and then create a plan. If you want to start running or start weightlifting, write it down. Make sure that goal is actually achievable; you should have a SMART goal or plan. Break up your goals into smaller ones. Temper your schedule accordingly, and then work towards each goal without overwhelming yourself with the bigger goals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition, I personally suggest creating and sticking your vision board somewhere visible, like on your refrigerator; actually look at it. Be patient with your body. Stop retraumatizing yourself with negative stories.\n\nJust like when you tell yourself something positive while practicing self-love and care, negative thoughts work the same, in the opposite way. When you continue being overcritical of yourself, it retraumatizes you and may even change your DNA. Let\u2019s take a cue from Mirna Valerio, and change our DNA in a positive way!", "keywords": ["mirna", "shes", "selfcare", "running", "tough", "runner", "shuts", "naysayers", "way", "questions", "work", "fatgirlrunning", "start", "promotes", "valerio", "started", "ultrarunner"], "polarity": 0.07558436330175462, "subjectivity": 0.43855992638601327},

Hues of black and brown formed a beautiful palette as the saints marched in their white-and-black vestments. White for the sacredness of the one to whom the service was dedicated, and black for their anguish. The preacher read Scriptures as the family processioned into the church. This was no ordinary funeral; it was a homegoing\u2014or a celebration of life, a passing from this plane to the next, from labor to reward.\n\nThere will be many more funerals in the coming days. On Sunday, June 12, news surfaced that 49 were killed and 53 injured by Omar Mateen at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla. Fueled by toxic masculinity, homophobia and terroristic fervor, Mateen used a semi-automatic rifle and a 9 mm handgun to afflict the bodies of Latinx, black and Afro-Latinx LGBTQ individuals, their families and their friends.\n\nIn trying to make sense of the destabilizing chaos, some intimated that Mateen was gay and had internalized homophobia. Others noted that homophobic rhetoric from sacred texts and U.S. politics was the accelerant that set Mateen\u2019s troubled masculinity ablaze. Indeed, queer-antagonistic culture, theologies and policies beget LGBTQ violence.\n\nThis violence affects not only queer people but also the people they love. CNN\u2019s Don Lemon interviewed the parents of shooting victim Shane Tomlinson, who discussed the fear of being denied a funeral service at a church for their gay son. His mom told Lemon: \u201cMy son has been in church his whole life, and let me tell you, he loved the Lord. \u2026 He always asked for God\u2019s direction. [My concern was] they wouldn\u2019t give him a service because he was gay, because of how some churches feel about the gay community.\u201d\n\nWe do not know what prompted the predominately white Refuge Church to hold Shane\u2019s funeral, given their lead pastor\u2019s anti-gay stance. But we do know that Shane\u2019s parents did fear being denied a proper homegoing for their son, and rightfully so. In 2014, Julion Evans\u2019 funeral was cancelled just 24 hours before it was due to take place because the church discovered that he was gay. Last year, Vanessa Collier\u2019s funeral was stopped mid-service because the pastor could not bear to see images of Vanessa and her partner sharing love. Many more queer and trans people have been denied funerals or buried in ways that they did not identify in life. Some queer people\u2019s partners are even disallowed from attending their partners\u2019 funerals or they are forced to conceal their love for the deceased.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe church continues to exploit queer people while failing to acknowledge queer humanity. Individuals often cite the black church choir to illustrate this point, but that is reductionist. Queer people do more than sing. They preach and hide their sexual identities. They give tithes and serve as trustees. Queer people keep the church doors open, even when churches are homophobic.\n\nThe suggestion that homegoings are a heterosexual privilege should also give us pause, given the queer history of black funerals. In Christine Turner\u2019s Homegoings (2013), we learn that queer people did the \u201cdirty\u201d work of adorning black bodies that had been lynched, raped and mutilated by white racists. The tradition can be traced back to the African continent, when Africans used ancestral rituals to send loved ones back to God/Goddess.\n\nI attended my first homegoing when I was 3 years old. My great-grandmother had passed. Every day for the first few years of my own life, she mothered me the way only a great-grandmother could. Her homegoing service is a lasting memory. I can recall an aunt taking me to her casket so that I could give Grandma a kiss. Shortly after, the morticians sealed her in. Though Grandma had left us long before that moment, she hadn\u2019t \u201ctransitioned\u201d until her casket closed for the last time. When her body was lowered into the ground\u2014\u201cFor dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return\u201d\u2014it was then that she had \u201cgone home.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHomegoings are sacred. They give us space to mourn with kin. There is crying and rejoicing, but most importantly, there is sanctuary. Toni Morrison writes, \u201cDone within the context of community, therefore safe.\u201d\n\nShane was murdered by a domestic terrorist radicalized by America\u2019s infatuation with the violation of women, the dehumanization of the poor, and the sadistic machinations of queer and trans death. His loved ones seek sanctuary at Refuge Church, while the families of so many other victims face funeral price gouging or the Westboro Baptist Church's violent protests.\n\nIf you have to fear the church, then, by default, it is not a sanctuary. That we must worry how Shane and others will \u201cgo home\u201d in peace, shows us that the church is not a sanctuary. That the church is hesitant to be present in these devastating times shows us that it is not a sanctuary. As such, gay clubs will continue to be sanctuaries\u2014even when homophobes desecrate them\u2014because in those spaces Pharisees and Sadducees are nonexistent, and the queer power of the Holy One rests in and on all who dance and love freely.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAhmad Greene-Hayes is a writer, a Just Beginnings fellow and a Ph.D. student in the department of religion at Princeton University.

You could say that the owner of high-end hair boutique Desired Extensions was born into the beauty industry: Her parents own All-in-1 Beauty Supply, an Atlanta beauty emporium that has served local residents for the past 40 years.\n\nConwell began working in the family business as a sales rep in her early 20s; she tells The Glow Up that her own passion for hair began when she started working with local hairstylists:\n\nIn the midst of that, I became educated on hair loss, growing hair, styling hair\u2014don\u2019t let me style your hair, but I can tell you about growing your hair. And from there, I started meeting a lot of stylists telling me about how their clients were losing hair, and some of the different issues that they were having.\n\nConwell began researching different hair-loss issues, learning about alopecia and the effects of chemotherapy, and talking with doctors about the different ways that their patients were affected.\n\nIdentifying a market uniquely in need of quality full-lace wigs and hair extensions, she began searching for the best hair available, personally wearing various products for almost two years before beginning to sell to the public. In 2009, Desired Extensions was born as its own Atlanta storefront.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlmost a decade later, the brand is thriving, specializing in women suffering from hair loss and in need of high-quality solutions at a reasonable price point (Desired Extensions hair products start at $115). Conwell prides her brand on providing undetectable, confidence-restoring solutions for women desperately in need, regularly giving one-on-one video consultations and even making hospital visits:\n\nI would say what drove my passion was when I started meeting women, and they were ashamed or in tears about their hair loss. And I would have women calling me sometimes saying, \u201cWill there be anyone else in the store? Can we meet alone? Can you come to my house and meet me? I don\u2019t even want to leave my house.\u201d And so, that\u2019s when I saw the seriousness of that. ... We have some pieces that are strictly for if you have alopecia, or are going through chemo with complete hair loss. Then, we have other pieces [for] if you have a head full of hair and want to sew your piece down, or you want to clip it down. ... [But] each time a consumer purchases from us, we always do a consultation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConwell is also fastidious about her suppliers, ensuring that she is never without a source of the highest-quality hair and that her vendors\u2019 preparation processes provide the best-possible experience for her clients, especially when many are already dealing with the stress of an illness. Says Conwell:\n\nI look for [the vendors\u2019] knowledge of hair. Are they familiar with cuticles? Are they familiar with steam-processing hair or do they chemically process hair? What will qualify a company is if they use steam processing\u2014we don\u2019t use any chemicals. Because companies that are using chemicals\u2014when you see some women patting their head, and their scalp is really itchy\u2014that is not a natural thing for extensions. People think that it\u2019s natural, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s usually that that company processes their hair extensions with chemicals, and you\u2019re having an allergic reaction to it ... And there\u2019s another tip with scalp itching: Don\u2019t use synthetic hair. Synthetic hair can make you itch, too. I always tell people: You want to use yarn to add in, instead of using synthetic hair. Dip it down in oil, and it\u2019ll keep your hair moisturized for your whole sew-in. A lot of people don\u2019t know that you don\u2019t have to use synthetic hair. ... But when you use quality hair, and no chemicals have been used, no itching on the scalp.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDesired Extensions also prides itself on providing a variety of textural options: In addition to offering standard straight, wavy, curly and relaxed textures, the brand stocks both kinky-curly and a tighter kinky-ringlet pattern and also offers custom matches. \u201cIf you see that we don\u2019t have a pattern that is your hair pattern, you send us in an image, and we can duplicate that,\u201d Conwell says. \u201cWe can duplicate any pattern, in any texture.\u201d\n\nCustomized wigs are also an option; they\u2019re available in various cap constructions, which Conwell\u2019s small staff of three will personally demonstrate and model via video chat, giving remote clients as close to a storefront experience as possible. Locally in Atlanta, clients can also book hair parties, where guests can play with Desired Extensions\u2019 product line and get much-needed advice on not only wigs and clip-ins but also protective options and hair-loss prevention. She says:\n\nA lot of people are getting away from sew-ins because they want to be versatile and change up their hair often\u2014if your hair is already braided, all you need is the wig to place on, and that alleviates the stylist. And then also, some people [are] complaining about losing their edges, [because] their braids are too tight; sometimes, you\u2019re getting the same braid pattern. When [clients] come to me and say that they\u2019re only losing hair around the edges, I always tell them it can be from stress, it can be from medication, and it can be from your stylist braiding your hair straight back on a regular\u2014you\u2019ve been getting your hair braided straight back like that for a year now. You need to change up your braid pattern at least every three months. That helps tremendously.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEducation\u2014and comfort\u2014are paramount to Conwell, who even consults with clients who can\u2019t afford to purchase from Desired Extensions. Because in the end, Conwell says, her priority is making women feel beautiful, especially when dealing with hair loss:", "keywords": ["extensions", "clients", "changing", "dont", "loss", "tress", "conwell", "women", "lives", "need", "pattern", "desired", "hair"], "polarity": 0.09807060755336619, "subjectivity": 0.4473443223443222},

Even before they start, no one tells you to expect clotting; or how sometimes you\u2019ll have to wash your hands three or four times to remove the crisp iron scent from under your fingernails. Or how, when you\u2019re stressed, sometimes Aunt Flo shows up unexpectedly and ruins your favorite pair of underwear. How cramps can be so painful, you have to stay in the fetal position with the lights off and a hot water bottle pressed against your belly. And could someone please explain to me how y\u2019all work that Diva Cup?\n\nThere\u2019s a mythology about periods that has existed for centuries. Various religions look at this miracle of the body differently, from shunning it to embracing it as a beautiful cycle of life. In one story, it is exalted\u2014the idea that women bleed for up to seven days and don\u2019t die is a power that men fear. In other stories, the body during menses is considered unclean. And as we move through a growing understanding of gender identity, it\u2019s intriguing to think that periods remain attached to womanhood, even as we know that not all women have periods and not all people who have periods are women.\n\nFor me, the question is: Where in the public and private sphere do black women have positive conversations about periods? I can only think of a couple of television shows featuring us that have handled periods with grace and love (The Cosby Show and Black-ish); but even in feminist circles, where periods are revered, there is a distinct lack of black women\u2019s voices\u2014particularly in the public zeitgeist.\n\nEven the language my parents and friends used to describe our menstruation\u2014periods, cycle, monthly, \u201cthe curse,\u201d \u201cAunt Flo,\u201d \u201cShark Week,\u201d \u201cmy visitor,\u201d \u201con the rag\u201d\u2014seemed either to disguise the fact that we bleed, or were derogatory terms that indicate being fed up with our bodies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCompounding this, among the messages I remember receiving about my reproductive development early on was that men will \u201cruin\u201d you if you let them. Looking back, it seems like another subtle way that rape culture informs the ways in which we talk about our bodies, both before and after we experience our first period. Men become more than the enemy\u2014they are portrayed as having an unquenchable desire to conquer. And when I became a woman, they would want to conquer me, too. So I had to beware of them; stay away from them, and yet at the same time, eventually I should still have romantic feelings for them, date them and, one day, marry one of them.\n\nNow complicate this with gender identity and sexuality.\n\nMy mother is high \u201cfemme.\u201d Always has been. Meanwhile, I\u2019ve always been a tomboy. Always wanted to wear boys\u2019 clothing; always wanted to be around boys; never really understood girls. So the changes I experienced from childhood to womanhood were not only unwanted but wrapped up in complex (and sometimes shaming) messages about what type of woman I would become\u2014or, rather, what kind of woman I should become.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd then, of course, our periods are almost always connected to pregnancy. In my early years, the message I received was that pregnancy was \u201cbad\u201d\u2014that is, until I got to my 20s, and suddenly everyone wanted to know when I was having a baby.\n\nThis policing of women\u2019s bodies begins, really, right from the moment we are born, when doctors take it upon themselves to name us female (or male), solely based on our genitals. We should be past the ideology of children as property, but we\u2019re not, so in addition to our virtue/virginity, our bodies are first the property of our parents. Then, when we begin menses, this property is fiercely guarded.\n\nAs we age, our monthly bleeding\u2014or lack thereof\u2014then becomes an indicator of not only womanhood but desirability, even sexiness. A woman going through menopause is told in not-so-subtle ways that she\u2019s a crone, past viability. Look at our movies and TV shows: How many times have you seen a 60-year-old man with a 30-year-old wife or girlfriend? Now, how many times have you seen the opposite? Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll wait.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe are given the message that men age like wine. Women? Like milk.\n\nAnd when I think specifically about black women\u2019s connection to our sexual health, I am reminded that the so-called father of modern gynecology, James M. Sims, performed experiments on female slaves, and that people of color have endured forced sterilization. So how can we even begin to see our bodies as temples of joyous sensual power?\n\nWomanhood, in its present form, is most often complicated by loss. Loss of innocence; loss of safety; loss of purity. But why? If we really value womanhood, then why is it so constricting? There is beauty in the hormonal changes that arrive with our \u201cfriend\u201d every month. I certainly don\u2019t need to bleed (which I don\u2019t, but that\u2019s another story) to feel the changes. But I know that at the end of that hormonal shift, I still feel renewed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd maybe this is the conversation we should be having about our friend Aunt Flo: That every month, women get to start anew, refreshed and rejuvenated. Maybe we can shift the narrative about black women\u2019s sexual health. We need to use our Afrofuturist minds to reimagine a world in which young black women are ushered into womanhood with kindness, love and joy. The natural processes of our bodies\u2014from the blossoming of our breasts and filling out of our hips to the inevitable hormonal shifts that may (or may not) result in menses\u2014should be celebrated as a step into a brand-new part of our lives.", "keywords": ["going", "loss", "flow", "dont", "womens", "woman", "women", "blood", "really", "men", "binds", "womanhood", "periods", "embracing", "black"], "polarity": 0.0995740008783487, "subjectivity": 0.48105213626952753},

I, for one, can think of no more dynamic combination that a person might be. ... And that is why I say to you that, though it be a thrilling and marvelous thing to be merely young and gifted in such times, it is doubly so, doubly dynamic\u2014to be young, gifted and black.\n\nWriter and playwright Lorraine Hansberry was just shy of her 34th birthday when she said these words, part of a speech titled \u201cThe Nation Needs Your Gifts,\u201d to the winners of the Reader\u2019s Digest/United Negro College Fund creative-writing contest on May 1, 1964. She would not live to see her 35th birthday, tragically dying of pancreatic cancer on Jan. 12, 1965.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHansberry\u2019s brief but remarkable life is the subject of Sighted Eyes/Feeling Heart, a gorgeous new documentary debuting tonight on the series American Masters on PBS. The title is derived from a quote of Hansberry\u2019s about the activism that in large part inspired her artistry:\n\nOne cannot live with sighted eyes and feeling heart and not know or react to the miseries which afflict this world.\n\nThe Glow Up had the opportunity to speak with Tracy Heather Strain, director of Sighted Eyes/Feeling Heart, about the journey that led her to tell the story of the first black woman to write a play performed on Broadway (A Raisin in the Sun). For her, the journey began 40 years ago, when her grandmother took her to see a production of To Be Young, Gifted and Black.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think everybody who encounters Lorraine Hansberry\u2019s words is really taken by her,\u201d Strain recalls. \u201cBut I think that if you\u2019re a young black woman and you haven\u2019t heard a lot of young black voices that were so strong and clear about what was good about society, what was bad about society\u2014racism, sexism, class issues\u2014she\u2019s so powerful.\u201d\n\nDirector Tracy Heather Strain on Sighted Eyes/Feeling Heart (Now Magazine/YouTube)\n\nBut while Strain\u2019s interest in Hansberry began in her teens, her route to filmmaking was less direct. Heeding Spike Lee\u2019s early call to \u201cmake black film,\u201d she bravely abandoned a career in advertising and direct marketing for an entry-level position at a production company.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAround the same time, Strain attended a 1989 Boston production of Hansberry\u2019s final work, Les Blancs, and fortuitously met Hansberry\u2019s ex-husband and executor of her estate, fellow writer Robert Nemiroff. Having worked up the courage to suggest to him that there should be a documentary about Hansberry, Nemiroff told Strain that he had every intention of doing exactly that; having granted film producer Chiz Schultz exclusive access to the Hansberry material.\n\nBut Nemiroff\u2019s death in 1991 understandably stalled the project, which then remained dormant for more than a decade. Meanwhile, Strain progressed on her path to becoming a seasoned filmmaker, producer, director and writer. When Schultz began looking for a director to revive the concept, he was introduced to Strain. And she was more than ready to take it on.\n\n\u201cWe officially count the beginning of this project as 2004, so we say it\u2019s a 14-year journey. But for me personally, Hansberry\u2019s been in my head for a lot longer,\u201d she explains.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe result is a truly beautiful two-hour tribute to an artist and activist who was well ahead of her time. Through interviews with contemporaries and friends like Harry Belafonte, Ruby Dee, Sidney Poitier and Amiri Baraka (formerly LeRoi Jones); coupled with Hansberry\u2019s own writings, narrated by actresses LaTanya Richardson Jackson and Anika Noni Rose (who voices Hansberry), we are introduced to a complex, deeply intuitive woman whose commitment to her work was paralleled only by her devotion to her race.\n\nWhat is perhaps most striking is how relevant Hansberry\u2019s work remains, over 50 years after her death. It is now especially poignant in an America that seems to equate making itself \u201cgreat again\u201d with catapulting us back to Jim Crow (at least). In Hansberry\u2019s own words:\n\nThe problem is we have to find some way with these dialogues to show and to encourage the white liberal to stop being a liberal and become an American radical. ... The basic organization of American society is the thing that has Negroes in the situation that they are in, and never let us lose sight of it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStrain agrees, admitting that despite the long road it took to get Hansberry\u2019s story onto the screen, her legacy hasn\u2019t diminished in the intervening years:\n\nI think that the underlying issues haven\u2019t really changed in our society for African-American lives. ... When we were trying to raise money for this, it was kind of frustrating for us that people were not getting that these words were relevant to the time. ... In 2004, you could see that her words were relevant. I think now, [with] it coming out at this particular moment in history, they seem more relevant and prescient and urgent. And I think while on the one hand, I wish it hadn\u2019t taken so long to make this film, I do think this film is coming out at the right moment.\n\nIn many ways, Hansberry\u2019s story may be even more relevant now, as it is finally a moment in time when it can be told in full. As a creative wrestling with sexual identity in addition to race and gender, Hansberry was a true example of radical intersectionality at a moment when the language to support her didn\u2019t yet exist. For Strain, it\u2019s most important that viewers come away with an understanding and respect for Hansberry\u2019s humanity, beyond the attributes that rightfully qualify her as a black American heroine.\n\nI think it\u2019s really important for people\u2014especially young people\u2014to understand how the person got to be in that revered position. What are the steps? Life\u2019s hard; being an artist, being a creative person, is usually a challenge for most people. And for Lorraine Hansberry, it was no exception. And so, I think it\u2019s important, especially for young people, to see fully complex human beings. ... And so, I hope that young people are inspired to think that getting an education and knowing your stuff is part of our history, too. It is not just somebody else\u2019s history. And I hope that with this film, anyone who [is] struggling with or juggling [their] identities, to know that they\u2019re not alone. Lorraine Hansberry wrestled with that. And then, finally, activism. You know, we have to all figure out how to contribute to making the change that we want to see. How do we make our society live up to its ideals? And I think Lorraine is a fitting figure to empower people to start wrestling with how they\u2019re going to do that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmerican Masters\u2019 Lorraine Hansberry: Sighted Eyes/Feeling Heart premieres Friday at 9 p.m. EST on PBS.", "keywords": ["heart", "hansberry", "strain", "relevant", "legacy", "young", "hansberrys", "sighted", "look", "eyesfeeling", "think", "lorraine", "black", "loving"], "polarity": 0.1804532392894461, "subjectivity": 0.5382370503060157}
