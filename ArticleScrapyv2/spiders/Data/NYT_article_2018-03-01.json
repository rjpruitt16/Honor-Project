Russia was not allowed to march under its flag in the closing ceremony.\n\nRussia\u2019s reinstatement followed a decision on Sunday by the I.O.C.\u2019s executive board, led by Thomas Bach, its president, to bring Russia back into the fold if the remaining drug tests of its athletes from the Pyeongchang Games were confirmed as negative.\n\nScores of Russian athletes, coaches and officials were barred after an investigation into the yearslong conspiracy that peaked at the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, Russia, when the state security apparatus colluded with sports officials to swap drug-tainted urine samples with clean ones in a clandestine, dead-of-night operation.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe scandal and its aftermath have led to much upheaval in the global sporting movement, with many athletes and some of the I.O.C.\u2019s own members critical of the way it had been dealt with. Richard Pound, the organization\u2019s longest serving member, boycotted the closing of the Pyeongchang Games in protest. The doping scheme has now tarnished no fewer than three Olympic Games.\n\nAt Sunday\u2019s I.O.C. session, where the plan to rehabilitate Russia was first announced, Nicole Hoevertsz, an official from Aruba tasked with monitoring Russian compliance, said the time had come to move on.\n\n\u201cWe should draw a line, we have to draw a line and look to the future,\u201d she said. After the two failed drug tests by Russian athletes \u2014 by the curler Alexander Krushelnytsky and the bobsledder Nadezhda Sergeeva \u2014 the I.O.C. did not lift the suspension for the closing ceremony, which it had called a possibility.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Our friends and families were there, singing, our kids, it was great.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe athletes seemed to consider their \u201cOlympic Athlete From Russia\u201d uniforms something of a historical treasure to be preserved, not a mark of Cain to be discarded.\n\n\u201cAthletes from other countries were coming up to us and saying, \u2018Olympic Athlete From Russia,\u2019 it sounds very honorable, really good; they wanted a name like that,\u201d said Ekaterina Bobrova, a silver medalist in ice dancing.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe winners generally attributed the far lower Russian medal count \u2014 with 17 over all, compared with 29 at Sochi, after some were later rescinded for doping \u2014 to the fact that much of the squad was not there.\n\nBut Ms. Bobrova said you could also look at it from the point of view that the Russians did really well winning 17 medals with so many athletes barred.\n\nThat was also a common sentiment at the podium during the ceremony with Mr. Putin, which was held in the round St. Catherine\u2019s Hall, decorated in shades of blue and gold.\n\nAfter a winner\u2019s name was announced, he or she was serenaded to the front of the room by an orchestra of about 30 musicians. All the hockey players walked forward to a blast of brass instruments playing an old Soviet hockey tune, \u201cNo Coward Plays Hockey.\u201d\n\n\u201cCross-country skiing was hit especially hard,\u201d said Yulia Belorukova, who clanked forward wearing her two bronze medals in the sport. \u201cWe had lots of young people on board, but we proved that Russia is clean and that we\u2019re capable of competing for medals in any situation.\u201d\n\nRussia has never accepted the description of a state-controlled doping operation in the country set out in great detail by its former doping laboratory head, Grigory Rodchenkov, and confirmed by three separate investigations. The World Anti-Doping Agency said it would continue to regard Russia\u2019s domestic drug testing organization as noncompliant until it does.\n\nMany of Russia\u2019s top athletes were barred from the 2018 Games because of links to the doping scandal. That led to a weak performance, and a vast downgrade from the doping-fueled success in Sochi, where Russia topped the medals table. Alina Zagitova, a 15-year-old figure skater, beat her compatriot Evgenia Medvedeva in a battle for gold, before the Russians secured the hockey title in an overtime victory over Germany on the final day.\n\nAs well as the Olympic ban, Russia was forced to pay a $15 million fine. The effects of the scandal continue to roil the sports world. Several biathletes, including members of the United States team, have announced that they will not participate in next month\u2019s season-ending competition in Russia, while soccer\u2019s governing body, FIFA, is facing scrutiny just four months before the World Cup in Russia over claims of doping by players from there.", "keywords": ["medals", "eager", "defiant", "hockey", "doping", "athletes", "world", "games", "russian", "olympic", "russia", "continue", "reinstates", "ioc"], "polarity": 0.1196668504451523, "subjectivity": 0.37836314628767465},

Just seems sort of \u2026 dull. Obviously I have a bad character.\n\nBret: Obviously. I\u2019m mainly relieved that the Olympics came off without a war starting on the Korean Peninsula. Although maybe it\u2019s premature to say that. Just after the last Winter Olympics, in Sochi, Vladimir Putin marched into Crimea. Don\u2019t be shocked if Kim Jong-un was taking notes.\n\nI guess we also shouldn\u2019t be shocked that Ivanka stonewalled a question from Peter Alexander of the Today Show about whether she believed her father\u2019s denials of sexual misconduct. She said \u201cit\u2019s a pretty inappropriate question to ask a daughter.\u201d What do you think?\n\nGail: It would be pretty inappropriate to ask a daughter who wasn\u2019t a member of the administration.\n\nBret: Wait, you mean that Ivanka Trump shouldn\u2019t play the daughter card while she\u2019s in South Korea meeting the country\u2019s president and representing the United States? That\u2019s so 2015 of you. But go on.\n\nGail: Blocking the kids out of my mind. Will not even mention Junior mixing business with \u2014 government \u2014 in India.\n\nLet\u2019s move on to Congress. House and Senate skulking back into action \u2014 or whatever you call what it is they do. Doesn\u2019t look as if there\u2019ll be any action on guns, does it?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBret: Not while Republicans are in control. The president has spoken about raising the age limit for the purchase of assault rifles to 21, along with a ban on so-called bump stocks, which are devices that help increase the rate of fire. The N.R.A. seems broadly opposed to both, however, so that\u2019s a nonstarter. And I don\u2019t think Trump is going to expend much political capital on getting the G.O.P. to change its mind, either. Which is a tragedy, given the number of future mass shootings we can expect, considering how many past ones we\u2019ve endured.\n\nGail: Yeah, if it hurts gun business, it\u2019s toast. Like the N.R.A. folk, Trump lives in an alternate universe where being armed means always being capable of hitting somebody in a crisis situation. And of course the president himself would have run right into that school the second he heard gunfire, armed or not. Because that\u2019s just the kind of guy he is.\n\nI think we should start by challenging him to hit the side of a barn.\n\nBret: In an alternative universe, Trump might have been the president with the popular clout to oppose the rank-and-file G.O.P. on the positions worth opposing \u2014 like the ones the party has on guns and abortion rights \u2014 while not opposing it on the positions worth preserving, like its past friendliness toward free trade and immigration. But since he\u2019s incapable of broadening his base, he\u2019s going to become ever more dependent on its hardest and most extreme core.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

As opposed to where we find him now, which is someplace between a weekend replacement talking head on Fox and a professional wrestling villain.\n\nBut about guns \u2014 you may be more radical than I am, given that you want to repeal the Second Amendment, while I\u2019d be thrilled if we could just prohibit gun dealers from selling caches of weapons across state lines. I just can\u2019t summon the energy to talk about changing the Constitution. When was the last success \u2014 1992? And it was to ban Congress from getting a pay raise until after an election had passed. Which had originally been submitted for ratification in 1789. Wahoo.\n\nBret: I don\u2019t think of my proposal as radical at all. I think of it as the essence of conservatism, coming from someone who sees himself as a strict constructionist. The Constitution provides, in Article V, a method for amending itself. Let\u2019s use it! Let\u2019s use it to repeal an amendment that, having left us awash in 300,000,000 firearms, is defeating the larger purposes of the Constitution as they are spelled out in the preamble: to \u201cinsure domestic tranquillity\u201d; to \u201cpromote the general welfare\u201d; and to \u201csecure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.\u201d\n\nWhat is \u201cposterity\u201d for the parents of the children massacred in Parkland, Fla.? Where are the \u201cblessings of liberty\u201d for those who were mowed down at a concert in Las Vegas? Where is the \u201cdomestic tranquillity\u201d for the relatives of the 11,000 people murdered with a firearm in 2016?\n\nGail: I applaud your sentiments. You\u2019re absolutely right \u2014 I\u2019m just sadly realistic.\n\nBret: Some of my liberal friends think that repealing the Second Amendment is a pipe dream, and we should focus on more achievable goals like reversing the Supreme Court\u2019s 2008 Heller decision and instituting a ban on the AR-15-style rifle, which was used by the killers in Parkland and Vegas. I\u2019m skeptical. The United States had a huge gun problem long before Heller. And most firearm violence is done with handguns, not rifles.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWe need, at the very least, to start talking about root causes and not just symptoms. Questioning the relevance and legitimacy of the Second Amendment is what the N.R.A. most fears, which is why I\u2019m going on about it.\n\nGail: Bless you. And the fight must continue. Just because I\u2019m sure Congress will punt on guns doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t really, really believe we have to change.\n\nThe other thing our lawmakers are supposed to do is pass appropriations, although I guess they\u2019ll kick the can down the road with some kind of just-keep-going bill. I am very worried about the whole spending situation. This administration is stripping so many good programs out of existence, from family planning to preserving whooping cranes. Do you have any worries on that front?\n\nBret: Hadn\u2019t heard about the whooping crane, which, for the record, I\u2019m emphatically in favor of preserving as a safe and thriving species.\n\nI guess I\u2019d make two points here. One is that mandatory spending on things like Social Security and Medicare keeps rising as a percentage of overall spending. Last I checked, it amounted to more than half of federal outlays, if you take Medicare to stand for mandatory health care spending generally. So the programs you mentioned are inevitably going to be on the endangered list, especially in an administration that wants to spend more of its discretionary dollars on defense. As I do.\n\nGail: We need to spend a whole conversation on military spending sometime soon. Let me just hint at my position by whispering: Monumental. Amounts. Of. Waste.\n\nBret: Uh oh, we might remind readers there are things we really do disagree about! Wasteful or not, I think Democrats should get behind some version of entitlement reform, to liberate, for the long term, some of the budget for priorities like the ones you mentioned.\n\nGail: Putting entitlements on the must-take-up-in-future list, too. Only whispering that we could start by lifting the cap on the payroll tax.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBret: Or raising the retirement age and block-granting Medicaid. (Cue the evil cackle.)\n\nAnyway, my second point is that if liberals want to preserve those programs, they need to start acting more like a normal political opposition and less like \u201cthe resistance.\u201d We hear too much from Democrats about how awful the president is, as if he doesn\u2019t do a fine job by himself of proving the same point. We don\u2019t hear nearly enough about the Democratic tax plan, infrastructure investment ideas and so on. I know there\u2019s probably a paper on a D.N.C. website somewhere, but it\u2019s not what the party is talking about. And it\u2019s what people need to hear.\n\nGail: I have faith that we\u2019re going to get more of that kind of conversation when we get actual candidates running for president. Until then I hang my head and admit you\u2019re right. Onward and upward, Bret. Save the whooping cranes.\n\nBret: And another hurray for you, Gail, for a truly magnificent and well-deserved achievement.

The North Koreans, including Mr. Kim\u2019s sister, canceled a meeting with Mr. Pence in Pyeongchang after he refused to soften his criticisms of the North\u2019s weapons and human rights.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNorth Korea seeks to be accepted as a nuclear power and win economic concessions in return for not advancing its nuclear programs any further, analysts say. But the United States insists it will never enter any serious negotiations or ease sanctions until the North commits itself to nuclear disarmament.\n\nOver the weekend, Mr. Trump announced harsh new sanctions against North Korea and warned of tougher measures if the North fails to relinquish its nuclear arsenal.\n\nThe hard line out of Washington has stood in conspicuous contrast with the more conciliatory gestures from Seoul.\n\nDavid Straub, a former American diplomat who is now a fellow at the Sejong Institute in South Korea, said there were rising frustrations in Washington that Mr. Moon was \u201capparently working at cross purposes with the Trump administration\u2019s effort to apply \u2018maximum pressure\u2019 on North Korea.\u201d\n\nThis \u201ccould result in a serious clash of wills between the two allied leaders,\u201d Mr. Straub said. \u201cIf the Trump administration or the Moon administation does not change its fundamental position, the odds are increasing that relations between the two will worsen.\u201d\n\nMr. Moon, a dogged advocate of dialogue with the North, had spent the last year helplessly watching the Korean Peninsula edge toward active war, as the North test-launched intercontinental ballistic missiles and conducted its most powerful nuclear test, and Mr. Trump threatened to rain down \u201cfire and fury\u201d on North Korea.\n\nDesperate to avoid a possible military conflict, Mr. Moon seized upon the Pyeongchang Games to craft what some analysts called an \u201cOlympic truce.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The first step, according to these officials, is for the administration to settle on a more consistent message toward North Korea.\n\nThe United States has veered in recent weeks from expressing openness to diplomacy to reiterating threats of military action if the North does not curb its nuclear and missile programs. The net effect, according to analysts, has been to confuse both North and South Korea.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhite House officials will also have to decide how to react if the inter-Korean diplomacy accelerates. The Trump administration is determined not to make undue concessions to North Korea, a mistake it says both Democratic and Republican presidents have made. On the other hand, if the United States takes too hard a position, analysts said it could prompt Mr. Moon to conclude that the Americans will never come around.\n\nThat could prompt Mr. Moon to set off on his own, isolating the United States by driving away one of its most important allies in Asia, which could end up drifting closer to China.\n\n\u201cOnce the ball gets rolling, it\u2019s very hard to stop, in large part because Seoul and Beijing want talks so badly,\u201d said Evan S. Medeiros, a managing director at Eurasia Group who was a senior Asia adviser to President Barack Obama.\n\nAnalysts said Mr. Moon was trying to get that forward momentum by seizing on this chance to move the peninsula toward peace with South Korea in the driver\u2019s seat.\n\n\u201cMoon Jae-in is not a na\u00efve waif,\u201d said Gordon Flake, the chief executive of the Perth USAsia Center at the University of Western Australia. \u201cThe South Koreans are desperately seeking to change the trajectory, which was leading to a conflict, and at the same time to do that while not giving too much space between them and the United States.\u201d\n\nFor both the Trump and Moon administrations, the first big test will be what to do about joint United States-South Korean military exercises that were postponed during the Olympics and the Paralympics, which will take place from March 9 to 18.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNorth Korea has indicated that it will restart weapons tests if the drills resume, scuttling Mr. Moon\u2019s efforts to broker a peace.\n\nConservatives in both South Korea and the United States fear that anything less than the full resumption of the war games would only advance the North\u2019s ultimate goal of ridding the peninsula of the American military presence, which they say the South needs for protection.\n\nBut progressive South Koreans who support Mr. Moon would most likely see a push by Washington to resume the exercises as \u201cthrowing cold water over the South\u2019s Olympic party,\u201d and as an effort to derail Mr. Moon\u2019s push for inter-Korean rapprochement, said Lee Byong-chul, senior fellow at the Institute for Peace and Cooperation in Seoul.\n\nSouth Koreans who attended Olympic events were cautious about how much the Olympic diplomacy could accomplish.\n\nYeon Ju-lee, 21, who recently watched a joint Korean team in women\u2019s ice hockey, said she felt relieved that the North\u2019s participation in the Olympics was easing fears of possible war. But, she said, actual political unification \u201cwill take a long time.\u201d\n\nAnother spectator, Lee Hae-man, 62, said recent developments were promising \u201cbecause we are all one family together, North and South.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will feel very betrayed if Kim Jong-un goes back to missile tests,\u201d he added.", "keywords": ["turn", "north", "olympics", "south", "lasting", "olympic", "koreas", "trump", "truce", "korea", "moon", "united", "states", "mr", "leader", "nuclear", "peace"], "polarity": 0.007703070931226276, "subjectivity": 0.39912877036663447},

Credit Antonio Bat/European Pressphoto Agency\n\nVictor Mather: Four years ago, Norway had by all accounts a screamingly successful Winter Olympics, but failed to win the events it treasures the most: the cross country relays. Indeed, Norway failed even to win a medal, placing fourth in the men\u2019s race and fifth in the women\u2019s.\n\nAt the Pyeongchang Games, it appeared all might go wrong again. After one leg of the women\u2019s relay, Norway was third, and after two it was fourth, 30 seconds back.\n\nBut Norway still had two aces to play. The first was Ragnhild Haga, the gold medalist in the 10-kilometer event. She stormed through the course and pulled within three seconds of the leaders.\n\nThen she turned the race over to Marit Bjoergen, one of the century\u2019s greatest athletes in any sport. Already a six-time gold medalist before these Games, Bjoergen had defied her 37 years by picking up a silver and a bronze in individual events in Pyeongchang. (She added an individual gold later.)\n\nAnd the relay? She won it for Norway. Of course. And it certainly made the victory sweeter that the runner-up was Norway\u2019s old rival, Sweden.\n\nFor good measure, Norway won the men\u2019s race the next day, coming from behind again.\n\nImage Adam Rippon in the men's free skate.

Lee/The New York Times\n\nA Voice That Soared\n\nKaren Crouse: Mixed zones, those areas where reporters descend on athletes immediately after they\u2019re done competing, are seldom places of high profundity. Imagine trying to hold a serious conversation in a packed subway car. But then along came the walking book of quotations known as Adam Rippon, whose repartee is sharper than his skate blades.\n\nRippon, who competed in the men\u2019s and team figure skating events, had a dozen memorable quips and comebacks. After his free skate in the men\u2019s singles, Rippon, one of two openly gay men on the United States Olympic team, was asked about the people back home who don\u2019t embrace him.\n\n\u201cHaters are just fans in denial,\u201d Rippon said, providing an answer, but more important, a mantra, for all of us who regularly put our work out there for public consumption.\n\nImage Xu Mengtao of China during the women's aerials. She did not reach the medal round. Credit James Hill for The New York Times\n\nWhen Olympic Stars Twinkle Overhead\n\nJames Hill: One night during the first week of competition, I had the chance to photograph the women\u2019s aerials finals at Phoenix Snow Park.\n\nIt was my first visit to the venue, and the photo manager told me that during practice he allowed photographers to stand underneath the ramp off which the skiers launch themselves. Normally one has to stand to the side of the course or far below by the finish. This vantage point gave an entirely different view.\n\nOne cannot see the skiers approach, which focuses one\u2019s attention. A speaker announces, \u201cathlete on course,\u201d and one listens attentively as the smooth sound of skis on snow becomes stronger and then, suddenly, the athletes are flying overhead.\n\nAs they take off, their skis carry a residue of snow from the ramps that disperses all around. Sometimes there is a lot of snow, giving the sense of skiers flying in a snowstorm. Sometimes there are just specks which, at night, dot the blackness like stars. As the skiers rotate, one can photograph them upside down or in some obtuse position that is both unfamiliar and wondrous to our eyes or, in this case, seeming to circle the earth like a satellite in the cosmos.\n\nImage Jingyu Lee and Yoonjung Park of the unified Korean hockey team took a lap around the ice after their final game of the Olympics. Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times\n\n\u2018We Are One!\u2019\n\nMotoko Rich: Losing all five of its games, the unified Korea women\u2019s ice hockey team was pretty battered, not just on the ice, but by intense political and news media attention. Yet after the team\u2019s final game, against Sweden, the players formed a circle in the middle of the rink and brought their sticks down in a resounding crack, while the crowd chanted, \u201cWe are one!\u201d\n\nThen the players did a skate around the perimeter to salute the fans as the theme song from the 1988 Seoul Games, \u201cHand in Hand,\u201d blared across the arena. The last player on the ice was goalie Shin So-jung, who let in four goals that night. She left to a standing ovation from the crowd.\n\nImage Choi Min-jeong of South Korea after winning the 1,500-meter short-track speedskating race. Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times\n\nInescapable Speedskating\n\nJohn Branch: The first night of short-track speedskating was a hoot, an arena bursting with energy and a crowd of knowledgeable fans cheering one of South Korea\u2019s favorite sports.\n\nBut you did not have to be in the arena to understand what short track means to the host country. During the last night of competition, I was on a high-speed train from Seoul to the Olympic city of Gangneung. My reserved seat in economy was behind a man traveling alone and next to a woman traveling with her child. I bemoaned my bad timing: I would not only miss being in the short-track arena but also would be nowhere near a television. Then I caught a glimpse of the man\u2019s smartphone. He was watching the live broadcast. I turned to the woman. She was doing the same thing on her phone, her daughter leaning in to see, too.\n\nImage Aljona Savchenko and Bruno Massot of Germany after their stunning long program. Credit Chang W. Lee/The New York Times\n\nA Perfect Comeback\n\nJere Longman: Aljona Savchenko and Bruno Massot of Germany, who were among the favorites in the pairs figure skating competition, fell to fourth after the short program when Massot made a jumping mistake. He seemed disconsolate, and gold seemed beyond reach.\n\nBut they rallied with a stunning performance in the long program. Afterward, having poured everything into the routine, Savchenko, who was competing in her fifth Olympics, collapsed to the ice. Massot went to his knees and hugged her. And they won the gold medal.\n\nUntil November, Massot\u2019s eligibility to compete for Germany had been in doubt. He is a native of France who needed three tries to pass a written test to gain German citizenship. Germany\u2019s president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, visited the skaters during the Games. Massot later confessed to a friend, \u201cI couldn\u2019t understand everything he said.\u201d\n\nImage Ivett Toth during her sizzling, and chilly, tribute to AC/DC. Credit Chang W. Lee/The New York Times\n\nA Biker on Ice, a Skater on the Edge\n\nJuliet Macur: After just a couple beats of the music playing in the Gangneung Ice Arena, I knew Ivett Toth of Hungary wasn\u2019t skating to the same old songs. Nothing from \u201cCarmen\u201d or \u201cSwan Lake.\u201d Not one of those go-to figure skating songs that I\u2019d heard about 1,143 times since covering my first Winter Games in 2002.\n\nThis was the first Olympics where skaters could perform to music with words, and Toth\u2019s choice was classic \u2014 classic rock, that is.\n\nHer music had the rafters shaking. It was AC/DC\u2019s \u201cBack in Black,\u201d and Toth was dressed as a biker. She wore a sleeveless, studded black leather vest with a zipper up the front and an image of AC/DC\u2019s lead guitarist, Angus Young, on the back. She also wore finger-less black gloves and black tights. It was clear that this 18-year-old was expressing herself and having so much fun, and it was heaven to see something so different.\n\nAs the music suggested, Toth rocked it. Half of the crowd clapped along as the song changed to AC/DC\u2019s \u201cThunderstruck,\u201d a staple of N.F.L. games. The other half of the crowd watched with jaws on the ground. I swear that I could see the judges growing pale.\n\nToth finished 23rd out of 30 skaters, but recorded her personal best score.\n\nWhen Toth came out for her free skate two days later, though, and the first few notes started playing, it was clear that she had left her hard edge at home this time. She went with \u201cCarmen.\u201d\n\nImage Joe Ward, left, with Doug Mills, whom he calls one of his \"heroes.\" Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times\n\n\u2018It\u2019s Going to Be a Good Morning\u2019\n\nJoe Ward: Anytime you can start your workday on a chairlift with the Pulitzer Prize-winning White House photographer Doug Mills, you know it\u2019s going to be a good morning. Wind chills of minus-20 and gusts of 60 m.p.h. only make the experience of working alongside one of your journalistic heroes all the more memorable.\n\nDoug snapped the famous photograph of President George W. Bush being told about the attacks on the World Trade Center in a Florida classroom. The multitudes of people who admire Mills\u2019s photographs don\u2019t also get to experience his generosity and humor. Some days, more than others, you realize you\u2019re lucky to be doing what you\u2019re doing.\n\nImage Artur Nogal of Poland falling painfully early in the speedskating sprint. Credit John Sibley/Reuters\n\nAn Athlete Falls, and Applause Rises\n\nDavid Segal: If Poland\u2019s Artur Nogal ever has grandchildren and wants to tell them about his Olympic experience, it is going to be a very short story.\n\nIn the men\u2019s 500-meter speedskating event, he lined up, crouched as he readied for the start gun and then sprang into a sprint. It lasted for two seconds. Nogal slipped and fell to the ice, his face of rictus of agony as he spun on his rear end.\n\nIf records were kept for \u201cshortest amount of time in the Games when you were in contention,\u201d this guy would be hard to beat.\n\nHe didn\u2019t stay on the ground for long. While the athlete he was supposed to race flew around the track, Nogal got up and slowly started to skate again. Then something happened that was either amazing or inevitable. Either way, it was stirring and spoke to the deep empathy of the crowd, which recognized immediately that it had witnessed an athlete\u2019s nightmare.\n\nThe audience applauded. It sounded nothing like the applause for Cha Min Kyu, a South Korean who ultimately won the silver and was rapturously cheered when he delivered the best time of the night, at least until a Norwegian bested him by a hundredth of a second. Instead this was the ovation of a crowd expressing its heartfelt condolences, or just saluting Nogal for years of training, and for having the grace and nerve to finish a race he had lost in an instant.\n\nImage Family and fans of Anna Gasser of Austria celebrate her win in the women's Big Air snowboarding final. Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times\n\nA Visual Cue From the Roar of the Crowd\n\nBedel Saget: As a visual journalist, I find it interesting that my favorite moment of the Pyeongchang Games was a strictly audible one. For the women\u2019s big air final, I was shooting from a position where I could see all the spins and flips but not the scores or the landings, a crucial component in big air. (Ask the silver medalist, Jamie Anderson, who couldn\u2019t hold onto first place after failing to land her \u201ccab double cork 1080\u201d in the final round.)\n\nI followed as best as I could by using the reaction of the crowd after each jump. By the third and final round, I had a strong feeling that the Austrian Anna Gasser \u2014 the reigning world champion and favorite whom I\u2019d followed for an entire year for one of our Olympic preview interactive graphics \u2014 would land somewhere on the podium.\n\nThe stadium was so quiet for this last and deciding jump, I sensed everyone could hear the rapid fire of my camera as Gasser flew past me, flipping twice and spinning three times on her cab double cork 1080. After she disappeared out of view, the exploding roar of the crowd told me that something special had just happened. Gasser had won the first gold medal in Olympic big air competition, and more important, this entire field of athletes had finally been able to reveal the progress and depth of women\u2019s snowboarding. It was a stark contrast to the slopestyle final, in which the women had to scale back their runs because of dangerously high winds.\n\nImage Vice President Mike Pence of the United States and President Moon Jae-in of South Korea shared a laugh at the women's 500 meters short-track speedskating race. Credit Julie Jacobson/Associated Press\n\nA Night of Geopolitics, and Gold\n\nRandal C. Archibold: In one night, I saw South Korea win its first gold medal, Vice President Mike Pence and his entourage push past me, and the North Korean cheerleading squad execute \u201cthe wave\u201d with robotic precision.\n\nWho knew short-track speedskating could deliver so much in one night?\n\nIt was a chance visit to the event, motivated by the simple urge to get out of the windowless office where I helped edit our coverage and to go see something. The other events I attended or covered could not match this one for its athletic and geopolitical resonance. So the first Olympic event I have ever attended will probably stay with me the longest.\n\nImage Who let this guy come to the top of the jump? Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times\n\nAn Olympic Veteran Reaches New Heights\n\nDoug Mills: Without a doubt, my pinch-me moment came when I was allowed to spend time up in the ski jumpers\u2019 start house. This is a place I had never visited while photographing several other Games, and I had not seen many photos made from inside.\n\nI would not have been allowed to show the reader the behind-the-scenes images without the support of the wonderful photo managers at that venue. It\u2019s hard to describe how far up the start house is, but I know one thing: There is no way I could do what these Olympic athletes do.\n\nImage \"As long as we can make people smile, we are happy,\" said one of the Norwegian men at the train station. Credit Inyoung Kang\n\nNorwegian Fans Help Make the World Smaller\n\nInyoung Kang: I was waiting for the 8:24 train back to Seoul when I heard the two men coming \u2014 laughing, chattering, clanking. They were covered in Norwegian flags, from their glasses to their cowbells to their Viking plushies.\n\nI gawked for a moment before asking if I could take their picture.\n\n\u201cOf course!\u201d they said in unison, beaming and posing.\n\nI snapped a photo and asked if they were in Pyeongchang to cheer for anyone in particular. In the station, I had met a Swede who had come to support his daughter, an Alpine skier.\n\n\u201cNo, we are just fans,\u201d one said. He gestured at his friend\u2019s get-up. \u201cWe came here for fun. As long as we can make people smile, we are happy.\u201d\n\nThe first Olympics I remember watching were the Nagano Games in 1998. As a child, I was fascinated by the sports, the teams and how the world seemed to come together and put aside its differences, if only for a little while. Now, 20 years later, I was in the country of my parents\u2019 birth to cover my first Olympics. I have always felt a bit like an outsider \u2014 a minority at home or a foreigner with an American accent here. But that night on the train platform, on my 20th visit to Korea, the world felt a little smaller. I thanked the Norwegians, and we parted ways.\n\n\n\nImage At the finish of the team sprint, Jessie Diggins made one small slide for herself and one giant stretch for Team U.S.A., clinching its first gold in cross country. Credit Dmitri Lovetsky/Associated Press\n\nBecause Minnesota\n\nTalya Minsberg: \u201cBecause Minnesota.\u201d That\u2019s a reason I was assigned to follow the United States women\u2019s cross country team throughout the Winter Games. Both Jessie Diggins and I grew up in Minnesota and spent hours racing around golf courses in the Twin Cities.\n\nDiggins and the other American women had a real shot at winning a medal in cross-country skiing \u2014 the first for the United States since Bill Koch took home a silver in 1976.\n\nOn Feb. 10, she finished in the fifth in the skiathlon. On Feb. 13, she finished sixth in the sprint classic. Two days later, she finished fifth in the 10-kilometer freestyle, just 3.3 seconds away from winning a medal. And when the stands were the fullest, on Feb. 17, the American team of Sophie Caldwell, Sadie Bjornsen, Kikkan Randall and Diggins came in fifth in the 4x5-kilometer relay.\n\nWhen asked if she still thought she could win a medal, after so many narrow misses, Diggins flashed a megawatt smile and said, \u201cIf I didn\u2019t, I wouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the day of the team sprint relay, my editor sent me a message: \u201cWant to chase cross country one more time?\u201d\n\nThe race turned out to be one that deserves to be replayed in Olympic highlight reels for years. Diggins and Randall didn\u2019t just win a medal. They took the gold.\n\n\n\nImage The Pyeongchang crowds approached the Olympics with a mix of enthusiasm and fascination. Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times\n\nSome of the Best Pictures Are Not of Athletes\n\nHilary Swift: One of my favorite days at the Olympics was the qualifying runs for women\u2019s big air snowboarding. It was probably the warmest day I can remember, and so a lot of spectators came to the event.\n\nMy colleague Doug Mills was at the top of the jump getting pictures of skiers coming down, so I was free to roam the crowd and look for features. To me, this photo speaks to what the Olympic experience is like for the majority of people who cycle through venues. You may not be an athlete or a volunteer, but you\u2019re supporting your country\u2019s athletes and others from all over the world.\n\nImage The media buses at the Olympics were like moving living rooms with live coverage of the Games. Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times\n\nPardon the Delay While My Country Races\n\nAndrew Keh: A bus full of journalists was chugging down a busy road last Sunday when the driver swerved onto the left shoulder, put the vehicle in park and craned his neck for a better view of the giant television propped above his head.\n\nRight then, Lee Sang-hwa of South Korea was inching toward the starting line in the women\u2019s 500-meter speedskating event. Lee charged around the ice, only to finish 0.39 seconds behind the eventual gold medalist, Nao Kodaira of Japan. As Lee broke down in tears, the driver tapped the steering wheel, let out a disappointed grunt and started the bus again.\n\nBus drivers were among the countless workers here doing thankless jobs to keep the Olympics running. But every so often, when a Korean athlete was about to perform, patriotism (or perhaps mere curiosity) compelled them to pause for a few moments. The passengers never seemed to mind.\n\nTwo days later, a bus driver on a different route pulled over to watch the final seconds of the South Korean women\u2019s curling win over the United States team. Some passengers clapped as the women, unexpected stars of the Games, celebrated on screen. The driver laughed out loud.\n\n\u201cWow, they really are good,\u201d he said to no one in particular. Then he yanked the bus back into busy traffic.\n\nImage Michelle Gisin of Switzerland was a friendly bus companion one day and a gold medal winner in the Alpine combined a few days later. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times\n\nExceptional on the Slopes, Normal on the Bus\n\nTara Parker-Pope: For me, the best part of the Olympics happened between competitions, when I would occasionally run into athletes or their families in a casual setting. I struck up a conversation with the Swiss skier Michelle Gisin on a bus \u2014 about her two siblings, who also ski (her sister Dominique won a gold medal in Sochi), and how her parents worry about them getting hurt.\n\nGisin was charming and humble. We traded pins, and I wished her luck. A week later she stormed to a gold medal in the Alpine combined. At my hotel, I ran into 17 relatives of the snowboarder Jamie Anderson a few hours before she won the gold medal in the slopestyle competition. \u201cYou know Jamie?\u201d her father asked, almost surprised at how famous his daughter had become.\n\nIt\u2019s an incredible gathering of athletes and families, all so passionate about what they do, and you find these athletes often are just normal people doing exceptional things.\n\nImage Two old friends, Matthew Futterman, left, and Jason Albert, tried to figure out where more than a quarter-century had gone since the last time they saw each other: on their college graduation day. Credit Gabby Naranja\n\nIs That You, Jason?\n\nMatthew Futterman: The Olympic Games are supposed to be about bringing people together.\n\nAs a student at Union College in Schenectady, N.Y., I spent the better part of my junior and senior years sharing a rundown house with a great friend named Jason Albert. We called him \u201cJ-bert\u201d back then. A lover of the outdoors, he was the guy who, on a clear night, would take his sleeping bag and crash in the middle of the softball field because, well, why not?\n\nWe spent endless hours on beat-up couches, contemplating problems large and small \u2014 Iraq, what we were going to do after graduating, girls who (rightfully, probably) found us unworthy.\n\nOn graduation day, we bro-hugged and said something like, \u201cSee you soon.\u201d\n\nWe didn\u2019t. That was nearly 27 years ago. There is no good explanation other than life, which carried him to Bend, Ore., and me to the Upper West Side of Manhattan.\n\nThe day before the Olympics started, as I was looking at my phone and hurrying to attend to a story, I nearly walked head-on into a correspondent for the great Nordic sports website fasterskier.com \u2014 my old friend and housemate Jason.\n\nIn that moment, and then at a couple cross country races where we leaned on a fence and watched the competition, we were right back on those couches \u2014 thankfully, without very much to complain about.\n\nImage From left to right, Mina Kim, Robert Fissel and the brothers Keun Hwan and Dong-hyung Lee taking in a bobsled race. \"It's so fast,\" Dong-hyung Lee said. Credit Chang W. Lee/The New York Times\n\nThe Best Bobsled Picture Has No Bobsled\n\nChang W. Lee: This is my favorite picture from these Olympics.\n\nIt\u2019s so hard to find a new way to illustrate many Olympic sports, especially bobsled.\n\nOne day as I walked down from the top of the sledding hill, I could barely see anything. There were spots where I could see some parts of the track, with the Olympic Village in the background or flags nearby, but they didn\u2019t make for very good pictures.\n\nI kept walking down. Still, nothing much. The competition went on, and I didn\u2019t have a picture yet. I heard the crowds cheering, but there was no bobsled in sight. When I had nearly reached the bottom, I saw a gap in the course. I peeked into it. I tried looking for several different groups of fans, but I didn\u2019t see much in the way of reactions.\n\nThen, there we go. I made the best picture of sliding sports I have ever seen, even without a bobsled.\n\nThree fans made all the noise in the grandstand next to the finish line. Just three fans. You could not help but hear their cheering, because just about everyone else in the area was stunned silent.\n\nImage Ester Ledecka of the Czech Republic stood stunned after winning the women\u2019s super-G Alpine race. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times\n\nDid I Really Just Do That?\n\nBill Pennington: The outcome of the women\u2019s super-G Alpine race had been decided about 10 minutes earlier. Or so it seemed. The top 20 ranked skiers had already finished, which in nearly every case would mean that the fastest time had already been recorded.\n\nThen Ester Ledecka of the Czech Republic, the 26th racer to leave the start gate, dashed down the hill. When she came to a stop and turned her eyes to the scoreboard, she stood motionless, her mouth agape. There was a No. 1 next to her name.\n\nOther racers and the audience were as stunned as Ledecka. But not three Czech fans in the grandstand. They began yelling, stomping their feet and shaking cowbells.\n\nLedecka was sure it was a mistake. Much of the crowd thought the same thing, and a confused quiet enveloped the finish area.\n\nBut there was no error, and bit by bit, the three Czech fans had a contagious effect on those around them. The cheering built slowly until it was a roaring ovation. It almost, but not completely, drowned out the three fans who first knew the truth \u2014 and celebrated the capricious spirit of the Olympics.\n\nOrder Reprints | Today\u2019s Paper | Subscribe A version of this article appears in print on , on Page B 8 of the New York edition with the headline: Moments & Memories Large & Small\n\n\n\n\n\n", "keywords": ["womens", "credit", "olympics", "large", "games", "olympic", "fans", "gold", "team", "medal", "moments", "york", "small", "memorable"], "polarity": 0.1348748929022366, "subjectivity": 0.42537959653193985},

Generally the athletes that manage to defy gravity for the longest can pull off the most complex maneuvers, positioning themselves for the podium.\n\nNew York Times photographers have captured airborne athletes throughout the Pyeongchang Games. Here\u2019s a look at some of their favorites photos.\n\nImage Jamie Anderson of the United States won silver in snowboard big air on Thursday morning. Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times\n\nIn the newest Olympic sport, big air, athletes shoot down a 49-meter-high hill and launch themselves off a ramp. The sport consists of that one jump and as many tricks athletes can fit into their time in the sky. It\u2019s called big air for a reason.\n\nJamie Anderson of the United States won the silver medal. Earlier in the week, she won a gold in slopestyle snowboarding.\n\nImage Shaun White competing at the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics. Credit Chang W. Lee/The New York Times\n\nHalfpipe snowboarders and skiers have more than one chance to go skyward. While traveling down the 170-meter halfpipe, athletes sail \u2014 sometimes over 20 feet above the rim \u2014 to perform a variety of tricks. They are judged on the degree of difficulty, height and technique.\n\nAmerican Shaun White won his third gold in the halfpipe. His third run was nearly flawless, and included a frontside double cork 1440 followed by a cab double cork 1440. Trust us, that\u2019s really hard.\n\nImage Cassie Sharpe of Canada won the gold in ski halfpipe. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times\n\nHalfpipe skiers are judged on the number of turns, snowboarders are judged on the number of rotations. So these athletes don\u2019t need to just get themselves in the air. To win, they need to stay there for as long as they can to complete their run.\n\nCanada\u2019s Cassie Sharpe won the gold medal in the ski halfpipe with a run that included back-to-back 900s and a cork 1080.\n\nImage Yuzuru Hanyu during his free skate.

Each jump is worth a certain number of points based on the degree of difficultly, and judges frequently watch slow motion replays of routines to make sure rotations are properly noted.\n\nJapanese gold medalist Yuzuru Hanyu performed quad salchows and quad toe loops, earning his second consecutive gold medal.\n\nImage Alina Zagitova skated her way to the gold medal in the free skating program of women\u2019s skating competition at the Pyeongchang Games.

Giant illuminated pandas roller-bladed around. And then, at least according to the guidebook, the pandas flew back to Beijing through the internet.\n\nPhoto\n\nK-Pop Takes a Turn\n\nTime for K-pop! CL sang the pseudo hip-hop song \u201cThe Baddest Female\u201d and \u201cI Am the Best,\u201d with torches and dancers. The crowd hit its highest level of excitement so far. And then some ritual. The national anthem of Greece. The flag of Greece was raised. The Olympic anthem. The Olympic flag was lowered and handed over to the mayor of Beijing, host of the 2022 Games. The national anthem of China. And that meant it was time for a segment devoted to Beijing. Yes, with pandas!\n\nPhoto\n\nVisual Spectacle and Some Math\n\nNext a somewhat abstract look at time. Some base 60 numbers were projected. It was a bit hard to understand, but the ceremony guidebook clarified: \u201cWhen the number becomes zero, the people of the future break free from the existing time and space, and arrive at a world no longer bound by gravity.\u201d And \u201cThe Axis of New Time set a new orbit of time in motion, and despite the fluid nature of the orbit, it reformulates itself by discovering and creating a new order.\u201d Thousands of moving lights and dancers made for a fine visual spectacle if not a crystal clear one.\n\nPhoto\n\nCross-Country Medalists Share the Stage\n\nTraditionally a victory ceremony or two is held at the closing ceremony. Here it was the men\u2019s and women\u2019s mass start cross-country races. Marit Bjoergen of Norway accepted her mind-boggling eighth gold medal and Iivo Niskanen of Finland his second. Thomas Bach of the IOC was on hand and was introduced for a second time as a former fencing gold medalist. In English and French. In French, fencing is \u201cescrime.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nNorth Korea and South Korea Carry Their Own Flags\n\nRather than carrying the unified flag that was seen throughout the Games, South and North Korea each carried in their own flag: speedskater Lee Seung-hoon carried South Korea, and Kim Ju-sik of pairs figure skating, carried North Korea.\n\nOn the stage, a mournful and reflective moment; a tribute to those who have died, led by a turtle and giant puppets. The puppets were kkoktu, used at funerals to guide the dead to the next world. Marchers carried dandelion seeds, symbolic of life arising from death. Turtles are said to carry messages from humans to the gods.\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Parade of Flags, Minus One\n\nNext up was the parade of flags, with each nation carried by one of its own Olympic heroes. Except for Russia, whose flag has been banner non grata at the Games. Ester Ledecka (Czech Republic), Jessie Diggins (U.S.), Marit Bjoergen (Norway), Ireen Wust (Netherlands) and Javier Fernandez (Spain) are among those who earned the honor.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd then came the mass of athletes, entering in no particular order rather than strictly by nation as in the closing ceremony. This entry was scheduled to take 20 minutes, although at other Olympics it has often gone on much longer. There were a record 2,920 athletes at these Games.\n\nThe Canadian delegation marched in on a high, with many athletes wearing their medals around their necks. They had their best Winter Olympics performance ever \u2014 winning 29 medals in total, 11 gold. You\u2019ll notice less athletes in the closing ceremony than you did in the opening ceremony. Many athletes \u2014 and most of the biggest name athletes \u2014 travel back home after their events. But the last event of the Olympics concluded just 3 hours before the closing ceremony. So if you see any athletes limping just a little, they may have participated in this afternoon\u2019s 30 kilometer cross-country skiing race.\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nA Blending of Traditional and Rock Music\n\nJang Sa-ik and a group of children got the South Korean national anthem assignment. The anthem was accompanied not by an orchestra but by a single marimba, a xylophone-like instrument. And then Yang Tae-Hwan, 13, completely shredded Vivaldi\u2019s the Four Seasons (Winter, naturally) in a rock guitar arrangement, as performers in glowing suits cavorted. Eighty traditional Korean instruments, geomungos, a kind of zither, were then mixed with the rock \u2014 the meeting of old and new. A prayer pagoda rose from the stage to cap the opening number.\n\nPhoto\n\nA Colorful Introduction and a Handshake\n\nIn a colorful intro, young skiers and skaters on wheels dashed onto the circular stage that filled the pentagonal stadium. There was heavy use of light projections on the stage. President Moon Jae-in of South Korea and Thomas Bach of the I.O.C. arrived and shook hands with Ivanka Trump among others. They were presented with snow globes by two children. Their significance? They were each born on July 7, 2011, the day Pyeongchang was awarded the Games.\n\nIt was 35 degrees in the Pyeongchang Olympic Stadium.

That group failed to reach common ground at a meeting on Saturday.\n\nThe Bach-led executive board asked the review panel to change a part of its report late Saturday. The report was changed to make clear the two failed drugs tests were not part of a systematic doping scheme involving the Russian Olympic Committee.\n\nTwo investigations revealed that Russia\u2019s doping program had tainted scores of athletes and multiple sporting events across several years.

Putin of Russia and other top sports officials from the country have denied that the doping program reached the highest levels of their government.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe effects of the scandal have disrupted the last two Games, shifting attention from athletics to litigation. Before the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, where Russia participated as a nation while some of its athletes were banned because of the scandal, the country tried to use the sports courts to increase its number of participants. It made a similar effort in the final days leading up to these Winter Olympics.

She was the second Russian to fail a drug test here. When the I.O.C. banned Russia on Dec. 5, the organization said a condition of the country\u2019s reinstatement would be a commitment to global antidoping regulations. Russia was also required to pay a $15 million fine.\n\n\u201cThis is not a decision everyone will be happy with,\u201d Hoevertsz said after Sunday\u2019s vote. \u201cWe will be criticized.\u201d\n\nThe decision to potentially reinstate Russia met skepticism on Sunday, with critics pointing to retests of doping samples conducted years after the 2008 and 2012 Summer Olympics. In those tests, Russian athletes had the most confirmed cases at both Games, according to the I.O.C.\u2019s own statistics (18 out of 65 from Beijing 2008; 21 out of 49 from London 2012)\n\n\u201cIf the retests shows the result then the I.O.C will take the appropriate measures,\u201d Bach said at a news conference Sunday afternoon, without elaborating.\n\nRichard Pound, the I.O.C.\u2019s longest-serving member, skipped the meeting in protest of what he considered to be lenient treatment of Russia. Adam Pengilly, a British member who also has been critical of the I.O.C.\u2019s reaction to the Russia scandal, was sent home from the Games after an altercation with a security guard.\n\nAfter being warned that their conduct would affect the I.O.C.\u2019s decision, Russian athletes have largely been keeping a low profile in South Korea. They have generally stayed off social media and refrained from making critical comments or displaying nationalistic symbols.\n\nThe two failed drugs tests were not part of a systematic doping scheme, the panel said.

It seems to have worked. Two of the women ended up on top of an Olympic podium at these Games and two more came close.\n\nThey also worked together to persuade the International Ski Federation to support them. Randall and Finland\u2019s Aino-Kaisa Saarinen were able to get federation officials to provide credentials for caregivers and to find space for baby rooms \u2014 stocked with diapers and toys \u2014 that doubled as a warm place for children and the people watching over them during long events.\n\n\u201cMen can have families, and they don\u2019t ever have to miss a single race,\u201d said Randall, who has pink highlights in her blond hair and is as ripped as a ninja warrior. \u201cKnowing we were all having babies, we lobbied to have some support for moms that first season back. It\u2019s the first time the international federation has provided that kind of support.\u201d\n\nWhile those changes helped, all of the other mothers lived in Europe and didn\u2019t face the same challenges Randall did in packing up her family and traveling for six months out of the year. For Randall, the only way to make the ski season successful as both an athlete and a parent was to enlist the support of her teammates.\n\nTheir buy-in was never in doubt. Randall has long been at the elite level of cross-country skiing, and several of her current teammates idolized her when they were teenagers. The goal was for Randall to spend time training with the team and still be there for her family. It helped that her husband, Jeff Ellis, a former Canadian ski racer, worked as a media coordinator for the International Ski Federation. Both sets of grandparents have also provided extensive caregiving during the racing season.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWe made this deal where I wanted to be as much a part of the team as I could, but I didn\u2019t want to be disruptive to the athletes,\u201d Randall said. \u201cKids bring extra germs, and he might be crying at night.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter talking with the coaches, her family adopted ground rules \u2014 sitting at separate tables in the dining hall to allow the athletes to decide how much or how little they wanted to interact with the baby. Randall and her family stayed in separate quarters, but sometimes those rooms were still within earshot of teammates, creating extra worry about whether a crying baby might wake someone up.\n\nThere were bumps in the road. It took a month for Breck to adjust to the time difference in Europe, resulting in multiple wake-ups at night. And it was also a challenge to be on the road with a growing baby. \u201cThere was a lot of gear,\u201d Randall said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

That part I hadn\u2019t anticipated,\u201d she said.\n\nHer teammate Diggins said the cross-country team knew that having a baby along during training and competition wouldn\u2019t always be ideal. Sometimes the Americans stayed in small hotels with thin walls, and team members would hear Breck crying in the middle of the night or when they were trying to nap, she said, speaking last fall at an event in Park City, Utah.\n\nBut Diggins said the team didn\u2019t want Randall to have to choose between being a mother and being a world-class skier, and they wanted to help her create something approaching a work-life balance. \u201cWomen shouldn\u2019t have to choose,\u201d Diggins said. \u201cThis team only works when everyone buys in.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAnd there were benefits to having Breck along for the ride, said Sadie Bjornsen, another team member. Bjornsen, who calls herself a \u201csucker for kids,\u201d said playing with Breck on the road helped keep her from thinking about skiing every waking hour.\n\n\u201cSometimes I will come in after a race and be bummed out about how I\u2019ve done, and I\u2019ll just go over and hug Breck, and it will make me feel better,\u201d she said.\n\nRandall, who plans to retire after this Olympics, recently won election to the International Olympic Committee Athletes\u2019 Commission. She hopes she can use her experience as a mother and an athlete to help other Olympic families.\n\nIn the end, she did not bring her son to the Olympics because the cost was so prohibitive. Instead, Breck stayed in Toronto with her husband\u2019s parents, and the separation was painful, said Randall. She said she wanted to work with the I.O.C. to create affordable housing for family members at future Olympics.\n\nShe hopes that seeing women like herself and Bjorgen on the Olympic podium will convince a new generation of athletes that it doesn\u2019t have to choose between an Olympic medal and motherhood. In fact, she asserted, the two can work well together.

In the women\u2019s downhill, Alice McKennis was fifth and Breezy Johnson was seventh. Over all, if you add their teammates Laurenne Ross and Alice Merryweather, there were seven top 20 finishes at the Pyeongchang Olympics by American women not named Vonn or Shiffrin.\n\nAnd another top woman on the United States team, Jacqueline Wiles, missed these Winter Games when she was injured in a heartbreaking crash on the final weekend of racing before the 2018 Olympics were to start. Wiles was third in a World Cup downhill late last month.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut on the men\u2019s side, things were more bleak.

Days earlier, Ligety had the highest finish by an American man at the Pyeongchang Games when he was fifth in the Alpine combined. The American men\u2019s team was without one of its top performers in Travis Ganong, who is injured. The 36-year-old veteran Steven Nyman was also sidelined.\n\nStill, Ligety\u2019s fifth place was the only top 10 result by an American man here.

Ryan Cochran-Siegle, who is the son of the 1972 American Olympic gold medalist Barbara Cochran, had the third fastest time in the field in the second run of the giant slalom. Cochran-Siegle was participating in his first Olympics, and finished 11th, but even one blistering run on a big stage can propel a budding career. Cochran-Siegle was also 14th in the super-G.\n\nBryce Bennett, another Olympic rookie and an intriguing prospect because he is 6 feet 7 inches, was 16th in the downhill and 17th in the Alpine combined.

Nikita Gusev had two goals for Russia, known at these Games as \u201cOlympic Athletes from Russia.\u201d It was the first gold for Russian players in the event since 1992, when Russia played as the Unified Team.\n\n\u201cSince I was five years old, when I started to play hockey, this was the dream of my late father; this was my dream,\u201d said Ilya Kovalchuk, the tournament\u2019s MVP.\n\n\u201cI think we haven\u2019t quite realized what we did.

It showed that this is the Olympics.\u201d\n\nNo Russian Flag at Closing Ceremony\n\nThe International Olympic Committee upheld its suspension of Russia as a team from the Games, a move that will force its athletes to march in the closing ceremony without their national colors or flag.\n\nThe decision, in a vote here Sunday, came after two failed drug tests by Russian athletes \u2014 among more than 160 competing here under a special dispensation \u2014 and after a long night of talks among senior I.O.C. officials.

The 15 medals is the record.\n\n\u201cWhen I look behind me and see what I have done, it's incredible,\u201d Bjoergen said. \u201cIt has been an amazing career for me; this is my last Olympics and to finish like this is incredible.\u201d\n\nTeresa Stadlober of Austria was in second place when she took a wrong turn, dropping her back to eighth.

Mr. Lee said that the pair jumped into the car and drove from Daegwalryong village in Pyeongchang to the athletes\u2019 village, in Gangneung.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether the athlete or the manager drove the car.

John Shuster, a four-time Olympian who was basically kicked out of the national program after the team\u2019s poor showing in Sochi four years ago, led the team.\n\nIt was one of the more improbable comebacks in the history of curling.\n\nWith a 2-4 record and three games left in the tournament, Shuster couldn\u2019t afford to lose another game.

It was the first gold medal for Finland at the Games, and the first medal of any kind for a Finnish man.\n\n\u201cIt's a big deal for us, I saw the list,\u201d Niskanen said. \u201cThe last Olympic champion in an individual race was 20 years ago.\"\n\nSwitzerland Wins Team Skiing Event\n\nA two-man, two-woman Swiss team out-skied Austria in the final of the Alpine team event. The new event featured four head-to-head matchups down a short slalom course with a small jump. Wendy Holdener of the winning team picked up her third medal of the Games and Ramon Zenhausern his second.\n\nNorway won the bronze. A United States team without any of its Alpine stars was eliminated by Britain in the round of 16.\n\nHere\u2019s What You Missed\n\nKjeld Nuis of the Netherlands, the 1,500-meter winner, edged Havard Lorentzen of Norway, the 500-meter winner, in the men\u2019s 1,000-meter speedskating race. It was the seventh gold medal for the Netherlands out of 12 events so far.\n\nThe old rivals Norway and Sweden headed into the final shooting segment of the men\u2019s biathlon relay locked in a battle for first. Fredrik Lindstroem of Sweden missed just once. But Emil Svendsen of Norway, whose poor shooting at the end dropped Norway from first to fourth four years ago, missed three times. As a consolation, this time it only dropped Norway from first to second, rather than fourth.\n\nIn a thrilling end to a battle between the sport\u2019s superpowers, the United States beat Canada by a score of 3-2 in a shootout to win the gold medal in women\u2019s ice hockey . Jocelyne Lamoureux-Davidson\u2019s goal in the sixth round of the shootout sealed the victory for the Americans, giving the team its first gold in the event since 1998.\n\nAlina Zagitova of Russia won the Olympic gold medal in women\u2019s figure skating, edging out her countrywoman, Evgenia Medvedeva. The two skaters tied in the free skate, but Zagitova\u2019s small edge in the short program made the difference.\n\nHere\u2019s What\u2019s Next\n\nThe closing ceremony\n\nVictor Mather is a general assignment sports reporter and editor.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "keywords": ["wins", "olympics", "hockey", "race", "2018", "south", "games", "olympic", "russia", "team", "medal", "results", "winter", "start", "won", "gold"], "polarity": 0.10986568619018952, "subjectivity": 0.38115640797760014},

People of all skill levels can get into winter sports like figure skating, bobsledding and, yes, even curling. Here\u2019s how. Image Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times\n\nThere\u2019s a familiar refrain heard in living rooms around the world during the Olympic Games: \u201cI could do that.\u201d Eye rolls usually follow. But if you are watching the Games and wondering if you can follow in the footsteps of those athletes, here\u2019s a way to get started.\n\nFirst, you\u2019ll have to check your ego at the door. You most likely will not be able to nail a chicken salad grab (yes, that\u2019s really what it\u2019s called) on the halfpipe or do a double full twist as an aerial ski jumper. With a humble approach, you can start chasing down your own Olympic, or recreational, dreams.\n\nImage Chris Mazdzer on his way to a silver-medal finish in the men\u2019s luge. Credit James Hill for The New York Times\n\nLuge\n\nThe U.S. Luge team runs \u201cslider searches\u201d introducing children ages 9 to 13 to the sport. Participants are taught the basics of using a sled and then take several runs down a paved luge course on a sled with wheels. The young athletes that show the most potential are invited to try luge on ice at a training site.\n\nDon\u2019t quite fit into that age demographic? There are luge tracks and clinics open to all ages.\n\nMichigan is home to two clubs and tracks for lugeing enthusiasts. The Upper Peninsula Luge Club has a natural track and the Muskegon Winter Sports Complex has a track built like the ones you see in the Olympics. Mere mortals can attempt a run at both sites. There are also courses in Utah and New York.\n\nBut don\u2019t expect to go too fast, or be able to progress too quickly. At the highest level, athletes move at 85 miles per hour. It takes a lot of training to get to that speed and precision safely.\n\nImage Kaillie Humphries and Phylicia George of Canada during training heats on Monday in Pyeongchang. The two-man event is the only bobsled competition in which women can participate at the Olympics. Credit Jeffrey Furticella/The New York Times\n\nBobsled\n\nWant the exhilaration of a sliding sport without any of the training or danger? That\u2019s an option too. Many sliding centers offer visitors the opportunity to ride in a bobsled with a pilot.\n\nBut the jolting ride will cost you \u2014 the Whistler Sliding Centre in British Columbia charges $179 per rider. The Lake Placid bobsled experience goes for $95, which includes a team shirt and 20 percent off your second bobsled ride.\n\nIf you want to take up the sport beyond a ride, Utah Olympic Park has a bobsled driving school. And U.S. Bobsled and Skeleton is always looking for new athletes: The federation hosts combines for prospective athletes.\n\nAdrenaline junkies rejoice.\n\nImage Alina Zagitova during the free skate. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times\n\nFigure Skating\n\nThe back-to-back figure skating gold medalist Yuzuru Hanyu makes it look easy. Don\u2019t be fooled \u2014 the ice rink can bring you to your knees, quite literally. Most people need to use something like a walker when they first try ice skating.\n\nMany ice rinks around the United States offer lessons and courses for a range of aspiring athletes. In New York City, Chelsea Piers offers year round classes for skaters ranging from 3-year-olds to adults.\n\nMany local parks and community centers around the country offer ice skating too, with a sliding scale of admission and rental charges. Even better? Skating on frozen lakes and ponds. But don\u2019t forget \u2014 without a Zamboni, it may be a bumpier ride.\n\nImage Chloe Kim, 17, outsoared her rivals to win the gold medal in the snowboard halfpipe. Credit Chang W. Lee/The New York Times\n\nSkiing and Snowboarding\n\nHalfpipe snowboarding, slopestyle skiing and aerials have all gained notoriety as some of the flashier sports at the Games, but no one is born able to do those brilliant flying acrobatics.\n\nBefore even thinking of attempting a run at an X-Games sport, you should be comfortable with your winter gear. Wirecutter, The New York Times\u2019s product review site, has a rundown of the best apparel and accessories for enjoying the snow. Next, you\u2019ll need skis or a snowboard, preferably something designed for beginners. That gear may shift as you progress in the sport, but moving from learning how to snowboard to attempting the halfpipe is a long road.\n\nSome camps and clinics exist to help would-be winter athletes make the transition from laid-back skiers who can take lessons at any ski resort to athletes who want to strive for time, style and better performance.\n\nIn Canada, the North Toronto Ski Club has specialized clinics, including halfpipe, slopestyle and moguls. Okemo Mountain in Vermont has programs specifically for freestyle snowboarding and skiing.\n\nImage Shani Davis of the United States won silver in the men\u2019s 1500 meters in both Vancouver and Turin. But in Pyeongchang he finished 19th. Credit James Hill for The New York Times\n\nSpeedskating\n\nLooking as graceful as the world\u2019s best speedskaters takes time. But if you are an experienced in-line skater, you already have a head start. Erin Jackson, a United States Olympian, transitioned from in-line skating to speedskating just months before qualifying for the Pyeongchang Games.\n\nMs. Jackson trained in Florida, home of a vibrant speedskating community (you read that correctly). But there are clubs across the United States and Canada, many of which host classes and clinics. One of the premier speedskating rinks in the country is the Pettit Center in Milwaukee, home of the U.S. Olympic trials in January. The center has a speedskating school divided by age and ability.\n\nImage Kevin Koe in Canada's semifinal against the United States. Credit Jeffrey Furticella/The New York Times\n\nCurling\n\nWant to slow down a bit? Try curling.\n\nThe sport is growing across the United States as more venues start offering classes and starting leagues. There are curling leagues across the country, with vibrant clubs everywhere from Tampa, Fla., to St. Paul, Minn.\n\nThe biggest leagues are concentrated in the Midwest. The Duluth Curling Club of Northern Minnesota encourages new members and offers free lessons. The Milwaukee Curling Club in Wisconsin also offers curling lessons, but most of the dates stretching a month in advance are already sold out.", "keywords": ["credit", "athletes", "olympic", "bobsled", "sport", "luge", "states", "united", "winter", "york", "skating", "started"], "polarity": 0.2049961641733794, "subjectivity": 0.44320099731492124},

All the hockey players walked forward to a blast of brass instruments playing an old Soviet hockey tune, \u201cNo Coward Plays Hockey.\u201d\n\n\u201cCross-country skiing was hit especially hard,\u201d said Yulia Belorukova, who clanked forward wearing her two bronze medals in the sport. \u201cWe had lots of young people on board, but we proved that Russia is clean and that we\u2019re capable of competing for medals in any situation.\u201d\n\nRussia has never accepted the description of a state-controlled doping operation in the country set out in great detail by its former doping laboratory head, Grigory Rodchenkov, and confirmed by three separate investigations. The World Anti-Doping Agency said it would continue to regard Russia\u2019s domestic drug testing organization as noncompliant until it does.\n\nMany of Russia\u2019s top athletes were barred from the 2018 Games because of links to the doping scandal. That led to a weak performance, and a vast downgrade from the doping-fueled success in Sochi, where Russia topped the medals table. Alina Zagitova, a 15-year-old figure skater, beat her compatriot Evgenia Medvedeva in a battle for gold, before the Russians secured the hockey title in an overtime victory over Germany on the final day.\n\nAs well as the Olympic ban, Russia was forced to pay a $15 million fine. The effects of the scandal continue to roil the sports world. Several biathletes, including members of the United States team, have announced that they will not participate in next month\u2019s season-ending competition in Russia, while soccer\u2019s governing body, FIFA, is facing scrutiny just four months before the World Cup in Russia over claims of doping by players from there.", "keywords": ["medals", "eager", "defiant", "hockey", "doping", "athletes", "world", "games", "russian", "olympic", "russia", "continue", "reinstates", "ioc"], "polarity": 0.1196668504451523, "subjectivity": 0.37836314628767465},

The president has spoken about raising the age limit for the purchase of assault rifles to 21, along with a ban on so-called bump stocks, which are devices that help increase the rate of fire. The N.R.A. seems broadly opposed to both, however, so that\u2019s a nonstarter. And I don\u2019t think Trump is going to expend much political capital on getting the G.O.P. to change its mind, either. Which is a tragedy, given the number of future mass shootings we can expect, considering how many past ones we\u2019ve endured.\n\nGail: Yeah, if it hurts gun business, it\u2019s toast. Like the N.R.A. folk, Trump lives in an alternate universe where being armed means always being capable of hitting somebody in a crisis situation. And of course the president himself would have run right into that school the second he heard gunfire, armed or not. Because that\u2019s just the kind of guy he is.\n\nI think we should start by challenging him to hit the side of a barn.\n\nBret: In an alternative universe, Trump might have been the president with the popular clout to oppose the rank-and-file G.O.P. on the positions worth opposing \u2014 like the ones the party has on guns and abortion rights \u2014 while not opposing it on the positions worth preserving, like its past friendliness toward free trade and immigration. But since he\u2019s incapable of broadening his base, he\u2019s going to become ever more dependent on its hardest and most extreme core.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

As opposed to where we find him now, which is someplace between a weekend replacement talking head on Fox and a professional wrestling villain.\n\nBut about guns \u2014 you may be more radical than I am, given that you want to repeal the Second Amendment, while I\u2019d be thrilled if we could just prohibit gun dealers from selling caches of weapons across state lines. I just can\u2019t summon the energy to talk about changing the Constitution. When was the last success \u2014 1992? And it was to ban Congress from getting a pay raise until after an election had passed. Which had originally been submitted for ratification in 1789. Wahoo.\n\nBret: I don\u2019t think of my proposal as radical at all. I think of it as the essence of conservatism, coming from someone who sees himself as a strict constructionist. The Constitution provides, in Article V, a method for amending itself. Let\u2019s use it! Let\u2019s use it to repeal an amendment that, having left us awash in 300,000,000 firearms, is defeating the larger purposes of the Constitution as they are spelled out in the preamble: to \u201cinsure domestic tranquillity\u201d; to \u201cpromote the general welfare\u201d; and to \u201csecure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.\u201d\n\nWhat is \u201cposterity\u201d for the parents of the children massacred in Parkland, Fla.? Where are the \u201cblessings of liberty\u201d for those who were mowed down at a concert in Las Vegas? Where is the \u201cdomestic tranquillity\u201d for the relatives of the 11,000 people murdered with a firearm in 2016?\n\nGail: I applaud your sentiments. You\u2019re absolutely right \u2014 I\u2019m just sadly realistic.\n\nBret: Some of my liberal friends think that repealing the Second Amendment is a pipe dream, and we should focus on more achievable goals like reversing the Supreme Court\u2019s 2008 Heller decision and instituting a ban on the AR-15-style rifle, which was used by the killers in Parkland and Vegas. I\u2019m skeptical. The United States had a huge gun problem long before Heller. And most firearm violence is done with handguns, not rifles.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWe need, at the very least, to start talking about root causes and not just symptoms. Questioning the relevance and legitimacy of the Second Amendment is what the N.R.A. most fears, which is why I\u2019m going on about it.\n\nGail: Bless you. And the fight must continue. Just because I\u2019m sure Congress will punt on guns doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t really, really believe we have to change.\n\nThe other thing our lawmakers are supposed to do is pass appropriations, although I guess they\u2019ll kick the can down the road with some kind of just-keep-going bill. I am very worried about the whole spending situation. This administration is stripping so many good programs out of existence, from family planning to preserving whooping cranes. Do you have any worries on that front?\n\nBret: Hadn\u2019t heard about the whooping crane, which, for the record, I\u2019m emphatically in favor of preserving as a safe and thriving species.\n\nI guess I\u2019d make two points here. One is that mandatory spending on things like Social Security and Medicare keeps rising as a percentage of overall spending. Last I checked, it amounted to more than half of federal outlays, if you take Medicare to stand for mandatory health care spending generally. So the programs you mentioned are inevitably going to be on the endangered list, especially in an administration that wants to spend more of its discretionary dollars on defense. As I do.\n\nGail: We need to spend a whole conversation on military spending sometime soon. Let me just hint at my position by whispering: Monumental. Amounts. Of. Waste.\n\nBret: Uh oh, we might remind readers there are things we really do disagree about! Wasteful or not, I think Democrats should get behind some version of entitlement reform, to liberate, for the long term, some of the budget for priorities like the ones you mentioned.\n\nGail: Putting entitlements on the must-take-up-in-future list, too. Only whispering that we could start by lifting the cap on the payroll tax.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBret: Or raising the retirement age and block-granting Medicaid. (Cue the evil cackle.)\n\nAnyway, my second point is that if liberals want to preserve those programs, they need to start acting more like a normal political opposition and less like \u201cthe resistance.\u201d We hear too much from Democrats about how awful the president is, as if he doesn\u2019t do a fine job by himself of proving the same point. We don\u2019t hear nearly enough about the Democratic tax plan, infrastructure investment ideas and so on. I know there\u2019s probably a paper on a D.N.C. website somewhere, but it\u2019s not what the party is talking about. And it\u2019s what people need to hear.\n\nGail: I have faith that we\u2019re going to get more of that kind of conversation when we get actual candidates running for president. Until then I hang my head and admit you\u2019re right. Onward and upward, Bret. Save the whooping cranes.\n\nBret: And another hurray for you, Gail, for a truly magnificent and well-deserved achievement.

He told her he wanted to improve ties \u201cin parallel\u201d with efforts to denuclearize the North.\n\nAnalysts said that once the Olympics ended, Mr. Moon would be left to sort out how much of the North\u2019s so-called charm offensive, in which it refrained from provocations like missile tests, could last.\n\n\u201cSouth and North Korea used the Olympics to use each other,\u201d said Yoo Dong-ryul, director of the Korea Institute for Liberal Democracy in Seoul. \u201cThe South was desperate to ease tensions. The North wanted to soften its image and weaken international sanctions. Now comes the hard part for Moon, after the Olympics.\u201d\n\nWithout a solution to the nuclear issue, relations between the two Koreas \u201cwill eventually revert to the same crisis mode before the Olympics,\u201d Mr. Yoo said.\n\nPhoto\n\nSo far, Washington and Pyongyang seem unable to talk. The North Koreans, including Mr. Kim\u2019s sister, canceled a meeting with Mr. Pence in Pyeongchang after he refused to soften his criticisms of the North\u2019s weapons and human rights.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNorth Korea seeks to be accepted as a nuclear power and win economic concessions in return for not advancing its nuclear programs any further, analysts say. But the United States insists it will never enter any serious negotiations or ease sanctions until the North commits itself to nuclear disarmament.\n\nOver the weekend, Mr. Trump announced harsh new sanctions against North Korea and warned of tougher measures if the North fails to relinquish its nuclear arsenal.\n\nThe hard line out of Washington has stood in conspicuous contrast with the more conciliatory gestures from Seoul.\n\nDavid Straub, a former American diplomat who is now a fellow at the Sejong Institute in South Korea, said there were rising frustrations in Washington that Mr. Moon was \u201capparently working at cross purposes with the Trump administration\u2019s effort to apply \u2018maximum pressure\u2019 on North Korea.\u201d\n\nThis \u201ccould result in a serious clash of wills between the two allied leaders,\u201d Mr. Straub said. \u201cIf the Trump administration or the Moon administation does not change its fundamental position, the odds are increasing that relations between the two will worsen.\u201d\n\nMr. Moon, a dogged advocate of dialogue with the North, had spent the last year helplessly watching the Korean Peninsula edge toward active war, as the North test-launched intercontinental ballistic missiles and conducted its most powerful nuclear test, and Mr. Trump threatened to rain down \u201cfire and fury\u201d on North Korea.\n\nDesperate to avoid a possible military conflict, Mr. Moon seized upon the Pyeongchang Games to craft what some analysts called an \u201cOlympic truce.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The first step, according to these officials, is for the administration to settle on a more consistent message toward North Korea.\n\nThe United States has veered in recent weeks from expressing openness to diplomacy to reiterating threats of military action if the North does not curb its nuclear and missile programs. The net effect, according to analysts, has been to confuse both North and South Korea.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhite House officials will also have to decide how to react if the inter-Korean diplomacy accelerates. The Trump administration is determined not to make undue concessions to North Korea, a mistake it says both Democratic and Republican presidents have made. On the other hand, if the United States takes too hard a position, analysts said it could prompt Mr. Moon to conclude that the Americans will never come around.\n\nThat could prompt Mr. Moon to set off on his own, isolating the United States by driving away one of its most important allies in Asia, which could end up drifting closer to China.\n\n\u201cOnce the ball gets rolling, it\u2019s very hard to stop, in large part because Seoul and Beijing want talks so badly,\u201d said Evan S. Medeiros, a managing director at Eurasia Group who was a senior Asia adviser to President Barack Obama.\n\nAnalysts said Mr. Moon was trying to get that forward momentum by seizing on this chance to move the peninsula toward peace with South Korea in the driver\u2019s seat.\n\n\u201cMoon Jae-in is not a na\u00efve waif,\u201d said Gordon Flake, the chief executive of the Perth USAsia Center at the University of Western Australia. \u201cThe South Koreans are desperately seeking to change the trajectory, which was leading to a conflict, and at the same time to do that while not giving too much space between them and the United States.\u201d\n\nFor both the Trump and Moon administrations, the first big test will be what to do about joint United States-South Korean military exercises that were postponed during the Olympics and the Paralympics, which will take place from March 9 to 18.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNorth Korea has indicated that it will restart weapons tests if the drills resume, scuttling Mr. Moon\u2019s efforts to broker a peace.\n\nConservatives in both South Korea and the United States fear that anything less than the full resumption of the war games would only advance the North\u2019s ultimate goal of ridding the peninsula of the American military presence, which they say the South needs for protection.\n\nBut progressive South Koreans who support Mr. Moon would most likely see a push by Washington to resume the exercises as \u201cthrowing cold water over the South\u2019s Olympic party,\u201d and as an effort to derail Mr. Moon\u2019s push for inter-Korean rapprochement, said Lee Byong-chul, senior fellow at the Institute for Peace and Cooperation in Seoul.\n\nSouth Koreans who attended Olympic events were cautious about how much the Olympic diplomacy could accomplish.\n\nYeon Ju-lee, 21, who recently watched a joint Korean team in women\u2019s ice hockey, said she felt relieved that the North\u2019s participation in the Olympics was easing fears of possible war. But, she said, actual political unification \u201cwill take a long time.\u201d\n\nAnother spectator, Lee Hae-man, 62, said recent developments were promising \u201cbecause we are all one family together, North and South.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will feel very betrayed if Kim Jong-un goes back to missile tests,\u201d he added.", "keywords": ["turn", "north", "olympics", "south", "lasting", "olympic", "koreas", "trump", "truce", "korea", "moon", "united", "states", "mr", "leader", "nuclear", "peace"], "polarity": 0.007703070931226276, "subjectivity": 0.39912877036663447},

Credit Antonio Bat/European Pressphoto Agency\n\nVictor Mather: Four years ago, Norway had by all accounts a screamingly successful Winter Olympics, but failed to win the events it treasures the most: the cross country relays. Indeed, Norway failed even to win a medal, placing fourth in the men\u2019s race and fifth in the women\u2019s.\n\nAt the Pyeongchang Games, it appeared all might go wrong again. After one leg of the women\u2019s relay, Norway was third, and after two it was fourth, 30 seconds back.\n\nBut Norway still had two aces to play. The first was Ragnhild Haga, the gold medalist in the 10-kilometer event. She stormed through the course and pulled within three seconds of the leaders.\n\nThen she turned the race over to Marit Bjoergen, one of the century\u2019s greatest athletes in any sport. Already a six-time gold medalist before these Games, Bjoergen had defied her 37 years by picking up a silver and a bronze in individual events in Pyeongchang. (She added an individual gold later.)\n\nAnd the relay? She won it for Norway. Of course. And it certainly made the victory sweeter that the runner-up was Norway\u2019s old rival, Sweden.\n\nFor good measure, Norway won the men\u2019s race the next day, coming from behind again.\n\nImage Adam Rippon in the men's free skate.

Lee/The New York Times\n\nA Voice That Soared\n\nKaren Crouse: Mixed zones, those areas where reporters descend on athletes immediately after they\u2019re done competing, are seldom places of high profundity. Imagine trying to hold a serious conversation in a packed subway car. But then along came the walking book of quotations known as Adam Rippon, whose repartee is sharper than his skate blades.\n\nRippon, who competed in the men\u2019s and team figure skating events, had a dozen memorable quips and comebacks. After his free skate in the men\u2019s singles, Rippon, one of two openly gay men on the United States Olympic team, was asked about the people back home who don\u2019t embrace him.\n\n\u201cHaters are just fans in denial,\u201d Rippon said, providing an answer, but more important, a mantra, for all of us who regularly put our work out there for public consumption.\n\nImage Xu Mengtao of China during the women's aerials. She did not reach the medal round. Credit James Hill for The New York Times\n\nWhen Olympic Stars Twinkle Overhead\n\nJames Hill: One night during the first week of competition, I had the chance to photograph the women\u2019s aerials finals at Phoenix Snow Park.\n\nIt was my first visit to the venue, and the photo manager told me that during practice he allowed photographers to stand underneath the ramp off which the skiers launch themselves. Normally one has to stand to the side of the course or far below by the finish. This vantage point gave an entirely different view.\n\nOne cannot see the skiers approach, which focuses one\u2019s attention. A speaker announces, \u201cathlete on course,\u201d and one listens attentively as the smooth sound of skis on snow becomes stronger and then, suddenly, the athletes are flying overhead.\n\nAs they take off, their skis carry a residue of snow from the ramps that disperses all around. Sometimes there is a lot of snow, giving the sense of skiers flying in a snowstorm. Sometimes there are just specks which, at night, dot the blackness like stars. As the skiers rotate, one can photograph them upside down or in some obtuse position that is both unfamiliar and wondrous to our eyes or, in this case, seeming to circle the earth like a satellite in the cosmos.\n\nImage Jingyu Lee and Yoonjung Park of the unified Korean hockey team took a lap around the ice after their final game of the Olympics. Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times\n\n\u2018We Are One!\u2019\n\nMotoko Rich: Losing all five of its games, the unified Korea women\u2019s ice hockey team was pretty battered, not just on the ice, but by intense political and news media attention. Yet after the team\u2019s final game, against Sweden, the players formed a circle in the middle of the rink and brought their sticks down in a resounding crack, while the crowd chanted, \u201cWe are one!\u201d\n\nThen the players did a skate around the perimeter to salute the fans as the theme song from the 1988 Seoul Games, \u201cHand in Hand,\u201d blared across the arena. The last player on the ice was goalie Shin So-jung, who let in four goals that night. She left to a standing ovation from the crowd.\n\nImage Choi Min-jeong of South Korea after winning the 1,500-meter short-track speedskating race. Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times\n\nInescapable Speedskating\n\nJohn Branch: The first night of short-track speedskating was a hoot, an arena bursting with energy and a crowd of knowledgeable fans cheering one of South Korea\u2019s favorite sports.\n\nBut you did not have to be in the arena to understand what short track means to the host country. During the last night of competition, I was on a high-speed train from Seoul to the Olympic city of Gangneung. My reserved seat in economy was behind a man traveling alone and next to a woman traveling with her child. I bemoaned my bad timing: I would not only miss being in the short-track arena but also would be nowhere near a television. Then I caught a glimpse of the man\u2019s smartphone. He was watching the live broadcast. I turned to the woman. She was doing the same thing on her phone, her daughter leaning in to see, too.\n\nImage Aljona Savchenko and Bruno Massot of Germany after their stunning long program. Credit Chang W. Lee/The New York Times\n\nA Perfect Comeback\n\nJere Longman: Aljona Savchenko and Bruno Massot of Germany, who were among the favorites in the pairs figure skating competition, fell to fourth after the short program when Massot made a jumping mistake. He seemed disconsolate, and gold seemed beyond reach.\n\nBut they rallied with a stunning performance in the long program. Afterward, having poured everything into the routine, Savchenko, who was competing in her fifth Olympics, collapsed to the ice. Massot went to his knees and hugged her. And they won the gold medal.\n\nUntil November, Massot\u2019s eligibility to compete for Germany had been in doubt. He is a native of France who needed three tries to pass a written test to gain German citizenship. Germany\u2019s president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, visited the skaters during the Games. Massot later confessed to a friend, \u201cI couldn\u2019t understand everything he said.\u201d\n\nImage Ivett Toth during her sizzling, and chilly, tribute to AC/DC. Credit Chang W. Lee/The New York Times\n\nA Biker on Ice, a Skater on the Edge\n\nJuliet Macur: After just a couple beats of the music playing in the Gangneung Ice Arena, I knew Ivett Toth of Hungary wasn\u2019t skating to the same old songs. Nothing from \u201cCarmen\u201d or \u201cSwan Lake.\u201d Not one of those go-to figure skating songs that I\u2019d heard about 1,143 times since covering my first Winter Games in 2002.\n\nThis was the first Olympics where skaters could perform to music with words, and Toth\u2019s choice was classic \u2014 classic rock, that is.\n\nHer music had the rafters shaking. It was AC/DC\u2019s \u201cBack in Black,\u201d and Toth was dressed as a biker. She wore a sleeveless, studded black leather vest with a zipper up the front and an image of AC/DC\u2019s lead guitarist, Angus Young, on the back. She also wore finger-less black gloves and black tights. It was clear that this 18-year-old was expressing herself and having so much fun, and it was heaven to see something so different.\n\nAs the music suggested, Toth rocked it. Half of the crowd clapped along as the song changed to AC/DC\u2019s \u201cThunderstruck,\u201d a staple of N.F.L. games. The other half of the crowd watched with jaws on the ground. I swear that I could see the judges growing pale.\n\nToth finished 23rd out of 30 skaters, but recorded her personal best score.\n\nWhen Toth came out for her free skate two days later, though, and the first few notes started playing, it was clear that she had left her hard edge at home this time. She went with \u201cCarmen.\u201d\n\nImage Joe Ward, left, with Doug Mills, whom he calls one of his \"heroes.\" Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times\n\n\u2018It\u2019s Going to Be a Good Morning\u2019\n\nJoe Ward: Anytime you can start your workday on a chairlift with the Pulitzer Prize-winning White House photographer Doug Mills, you know it\u2019s going to be a good morning. Wind chills of minus-20 and gusts of 60 m.p.h. only make the experience of working alongside one of your journalistic heroes all the more memorable.\n\nDoug snapped the famous photograph of President George W. Bush being told about the attacks on the World Trade Center in a Florida classroom. The multitudes of people who admire Mills\u2019s photographs don\u2019t also get to experience his generosity and humor. Some days, more than others, you realize you\u2019re lucky to be doing what you\u2019re doing.\n\nImage Artur Nogal of Poland falling painfully early in the speedskating sprint. Credit John Sibley/Reuters\n\nAn Athlete Falls, and Applause Rises\n\nDavid Segal: If Poland\u2019s Artur Nogal ever has grandchildren and wants to tell them about his Olympic experience, it is going to be a very short story.\n\nIn the men\u2019s 500-meter speedskating event, he lined up, crouched as he readied for the start gun and then sprang into a sprint. It lasted for two seconds. Nogal slipped and fell to the ice, his face of rictus of agony as he spun on his rear end.\n\nIf records were kept for \u201cshortest amount of time in the Games when you were in contention,\u201d this guy would be hard to beat.\n\nHe didn\u2019t stay on the ground for long. While the athlete he was supposed to race flew around the track, Nogal got up and slowly started to skate again. Then something happened that was either amazing or inevitable. Either way, it was stirring and spoke to the deep empathy of the crowd, which recognized immediately that it had witnessed an athlete\u2019s nightmare.\n\nThe audience applauded. It sounded nothing like the applause for Cha Min Kyu, a South Korean who ultimately won the silver and was rapturously cheered when he delivered the best time of the night, at least until a Norwegian bested him by a hundredth of a second. Instead this was the ovation of a crowd expressing its heartfelt condolences, or just saluting Nogal for years of training, and for having the grace and nerve to finish a race he had lost in an instant.\n\nImage Family and fans of Anna Gasser of Austria celebrate her win in the women's Big Air snowboarding final. Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times\n\nA Visual Cue From the Roar of the Crowd\n\nBedel Saget: As a visual journalist, I find it interesting that my favorite moment of the Pyeongchang Games was a strictly audible one. For the women\u2019s big air final, I was shooting from a position where I could see all the spins and flips but not the scores or the landings, a crucial component in big air. (Ask the silver medalist, Jamie Anderson, who couldn\u2019t hold onto first place after failing to land her \u201ccab double cork 1080\u201d in the final round.)\n\nI followed as best as I could by using the reaction of the crowd after each jump. By the third and final round, I had a strong feeling that the Austrian Anna Gasser \u2014 the reigning world champion and favorite whom I\u2019d followed for an entire year for one of our Olympic preview interactive graphics \u2014 would land somewhere on the podium.\n\nThe stadium was so quiet for this last and deciding jump, I sensed everyone could hear the rapid fire of my camera as Gasser flew past me, flipping twice and spinning three times on her cab double cork 1080. After she disappeared out of view, the exploding roar of the crowd told me that something special had just happened. Gasser had won the first gold medal in Olympic big air competition, and more important, this entire field of athletes had finally been able to reveal the progress and depth of women\u2019s snowboarding. It was a stark contrast to the slopestyle final, in which the women had to scale back their runs because of dangerously high winds.\n\nImage Vice President Mike Pence of the United States and President Moon Jae-in of South Korea shared a laugh at the women's 500 meters short-track speedskating race. Credit Julie Jacobson/Associated Press\n\nA Night of Geopolitics, and Gold\n\nRandal C. Archibold: In one night, I saw South Korea win its first gold medal, Vice President Mike Pence and his entourage push past me, and the North Korean cheerleading squad execute \u201cthe wave\u201d with robotic precision.\n\nWho knew short-track speedskating could deliver so much in one night?\n\nIt was a chance visit to the event, motivated by the simple urge to get out of the windowless office where I helped edit our coverage and to go see something. The other events I attended or covered could not match this one for its athletic and geopolitical resonance. So the first Olympic event I have ever attended will probably stay with me the longest.\n\nImage Who let this guy come to the top of the jump? Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times\n\nAn Olympic Veteran Reaches New Heights\n\nDoug Mills: Without a doubt, my pinch-me moment came when I was allowed to spend time up in the ski jumpers\u2019 start house. This is a place I had never visited while photographing several other Games, and I had not seen many photos made from inside.\n\nI would not have been allowed to show the reader the behind-the-scenes images without the support of the wonderful photo managers at that venue. It\u2019s hard to describe how far up the start house is, but I know one thing: There is no way I could do what these Olympic athletes do.\n\nImage \"As long as we can make people smile, we are happy,\" said one of the Norwegian men at the train station. Credit Inyoung Kang\n\nNorwegian Fans Help Make the World Smaller\n\nInyoung Kang: I was waiting for the 8:24 train back to Seoul when I heard the two men coming \u2014 laughing, chattering, clanking. They were covered in Norwegian flags, from their glasses to their cowbells to their Viking plushies.\n\nI gawked for a moment before asking if I could take their picture.\n\n\u201cOf course!\u201d they said in unison, beaming and posing.\n\nI snapped a photo and asked if they were in Pyeongchang to cheer for anyone in particular. In the station, I had met a Swede who had come to support his daughter, an Alpine skier.\n\n\u201cNo, we are just fans,\u201d one said. He gestured at his friend\u2019s get-up. \u201cWe came here for fun. As long as we can make people smile, we are happy.\u201d\n\nThe first Olympics I remember watching were the Nagano Games in 1998. As a child, I was fascinated by the sports, the teams and how the world seemed to come together and put aside its differences, if only for a little while. Now, 20 years later, I was in the country of my parents\u2019 birth to cover my first Olympics. I have always felt a bit like an outsider \u2014 a minority at home or a foreigner with an American accent here. But that night on the train platform, on my 20th visit to Korea, the world felt a little smaller. I thanked the Norwegians, and we parted ways.\n\n\n\nImage At the finish of the team sprint, Jessie Diggins made one small slide for herself and one giant stretch for Team U.S.A., clinching its first gold in cross country. Credit Dmitri Lovetsky/Associated Press\n\nBecause Minnesota\n\nTalya Minsberg: \u201cBecause Minnesota.\u201d That\u2019s a reason I was assigned to follow the United States women\u2019s cross country team throughout the Winter Games. Both Jessie Diggins and I grew up in Minnesota and spent hours racing around golf courses in the Twin Cities.\n\nDiggins and the other American women had a real shot at winning a medal in cross-country skiing \u2014 the first for the United States since Bill Koch took home a silver in 1976.\n\nOn Feb. 10, she finished in the fifth in the skiathlon. On Feb. 13, she finished sixth in the sprint classic. Two days later, she finished fifth in the 10-kilometer freestyle, just 3.3 seconds away from winning a medal. And when the stands were the fullest, on Feb. 17, the American team of Sophie Caldwell, Sadie Bjornsen, Kikkan Randall and Diggins came in fifth in the 4x5-kilometer relay.\n\nWhen asked if she still thought she could win a medal, after so many narrow misses, Diggins flashed a megawatt smile and said, \u201cIf I didn\u2019t, I wouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the day of the team sprint relay, my editor sent me a message: \u201cWant to chase cross country one more time?\u201d\n\nThe race turned out to be one that deserves to be replayed in Olympic highlight reels for years. Diggins and Randall didn\u2019t just win a medal. They took the gold.\n\n\n\nImage The Pyeongchang crowds approached the Olympics with a mix of enthusiasm and fascination. Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times\n\nSome of the Best Pictures Are Not of Athletes\n\nHilary Swift: One of my favorite days at the Olympics was the qualifying runs for women\u2019s big air snowboarding. It was probably the warmest day I can remember, and so a lot of spectators came to the event.\n\nMy colleague Doug Mills was at the top of the jump getting pictures of skiers coming down, so I was free to roam the crowd and look for features. To me, this photo speaks to what the Olympic experience is like for the majority of people who cycle through venues. You may not be an athlete or a volunteer, but you\u2019re supporting your country\u2019s athletes and others from all over the world.\n\nImage The media buses at the Olympics were like moving living rooms with live coverage of the Games. Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times\n\nPardon the Delay While My Country Races\n\nAndrew Keh: A bus full of journalists was chugging down a busy road last Sunday when the driver swerved onto the left shoulder, put the vehicle in park and craned his neck for a better view of the giant television propped above his head.\n\nRight then, Lee Sang-hwa of South Korea was inching toward the starting line in the women\u2019s 500-meter speedskating event. Lee charged around the ice, only to finish 0.39 seconds behind the eventual gold medalist, Nao Kodaira of Japan. As Lee broke down in tears, the driver tapped the steering wheel, let out a disappointed grunt and started the bus again.\n\nBus drivers were among the countless workers here doing thankless jobs to keep the Olympics running. But every so often, when a Korean athlete was about to perform, patriotism (or perhaps mere curiosity) compelled them to pause for a few moments. The passengers never seemed to mind.\n\nTwo days later, a bus driver on a different route pulled over to watch the final seconds of the South Korean women\u2019s curling win over the United States team. Some passengers clapped as the women, unexpected stars of the Games, celebrated on screen. The driver laughed out loud.\n\n\u201cWow, they really are good,\u201d he said to no one in particular. Then he yanked the bus back into busy traffic.\n\nImage Michelle Gisin of Switzerland was a friendly bus companion one day and a gold medal winner in the Alpine combined a few days later. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times\n\nExceptional on the Slopes, Normal on the Bus\n\nTara Parker-Pope: For me, the best part of the Olympics happened between competitions, when I would occasionally run into athletes or their families in a casual setting. I struck up a conversation with the Swiss skier Michelle Gisin on a bus \u2014 about her two siblings, who also ski (her sister Dominique won a gold medal in Sochi), and how her parents worry about them getting hurt.\n\nGisin was charming and humble. We traded pins, and I wished her luck. A week later she stormed to a gold medal in the Alpine combined. At my hotel, I ran into 17 relatives of the snowboarder Jamie Anderson a few hours before she won the gold medal in the slopestyle competition. \u201cYou know Jamie?\u201d her father asked, almost surprised at how famous his daughter had become.\n\nIt\u2019s an incredible gathering of athletes and families, all so passionate about what they do, and you find these athletes often are just normal people doing exceptional things.\n\nImage Two old friends, Matthew Futterman, left, and Jason Albert, tried to figure out where more than a quarter-century had gone since the last time they saw each other: on their college graduation day. Credit Gabby Naranja\n\nIs That You, Jason?\n\nMatthew Futterman: The Olympic Games are supposed to be about bringing people together.\n\nAs a student at Union College in Schenectady, N.Y., I spent the better part of my junior and senior years sharing a rundown house with a great friend named Jason Albert. We called him \u201cJ-bert\u201d back then. A lover of the outdoors, he was the guy who, on a clear night, would take his sleeping bag and crash in the middle of the softball field because, well, why not?\n\nWe spent endless hours on beat-up couches, contemplating problems large and small \u2014 Iraq, what we were going to do after graduating, girls who (rightfully, probably) found us unworthy.\n\nOn graduation day, we bro-hugged and said something like, \u201cSee you soon.\u201d\n\nWe didn\u2019t. That was nearly 27 years ago. There is no good explanation other than life, which carried him to Bend, Ore., and me to the Upper West Side of Manhattan.\n\nThe day before the Olympics started, as I was looking at my phone and hurrying to attend to a story, I nearly walked head-on into a correspondent for the great Nordic sports website fasterskier.com \u2014 my old friend and housemate Jason.\n\nIn that moment, and then at a couple cross country races where we leaned on a fence and watched the competition, we were right back on those couches \u2014 thankfully, without very much to complain about.\n\nImage From left to right, Mina Kim, Robert Fissel and the brothers Keun Hwan and Dong-hyung Lee taking in a bobsled race. \"It's so fast,\" Dong-hyung Lee said.

Lee: This is my favorite picture from these Olympics.\n\nIt\u2019s so hard to find a new way to illustrate many Olympic sports, especially bobsled.\n\nOne day as I walked down from the top of the sledding hill, I could barely see anything. There were spots where I could see some parts of the track, with the Olympic Village in the background or flags nearby, but they didn\u2019t make for very good pictures.\n\nI kept walking down. Still, nothing much. The competition went on, and I didn\u2019t have a picture yet. I heard the crowds cheering, but there was no bobsled in sight. When I had nearly reached the bottom, I saw a gap in the course. I peeked into it. I tried looking for several different groups of fans, but I didn\u2019t see much in the way of reactions.\n\nThen, there we go. I made the best picture of sliding sports I have ever seen, even without a bobsled.\n\nThree fans made all the noise in the grandstand next to the finish line. Just three fans. You could not help but hear their cheering, because just about everyone else in the area was stunned silent.\n\nImage Ester Ledecka of the Czech Republic stood stunned after winning the women\u2019s super-G Alpine race. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times\n\nDid I Really Just Do That?\n\nBill Pennington: The outcome of the women\u2019s super-G Alpine race had been decided about 10 minutes earlier. Or so it seemed. The top 20 ranked skiers had already finished, which in nearly every case would mean that the fastest time had already been recorded.\n\nThen Ester Ledecka of the Czech Republic, the 26th racer to leave the start gate, dashed down the hill. When she came to a stop and turned her eyes to the scoreboard, she stood motionless, her mouth agape. There was a No. 1 next to her name.\n\nOther racers and the audience were as stunned as Ledecka. But not three Czech fans in the grandstand. They began yelling, stomping their feet and shaking cowbells.\n\nLedecka was sure it was a mistake. Much of the crowd thought the same thing, and a confused quiet enveloped the finish area.\n\nBut there was no error, and bit by bit, the three Czech fans had a contagious effect on those around them. The cheering built slowly until it was a roaring ovation. It almost, but not completely, drowned out the three fans who first knew the truth \u2014 and celebrated the capricious spirit of the Olympics.\n\nOrder Reprints | Today\u2019s Paper | Subscribe A version of this article appears in print on , on Page B 8 of the New York edition with the headline: Moments & Memories Large & Small\n\n\n\n\n\n", "keywords": ["womens", "credit", "olympics", "large", "games", "olympic", "fans", "gold", "team", "medal", "moments", "york", "small", "memorable"], "polarity": 0.1348748929022366, "subjectivity": 0.42537959653193985},

Generally the athletes that manage to defy gravity for the longest can pull off the most complex maneuvers, positioning themselves for the podium.\n\nNew York Times photographers have captured airborne athletes throughout the Pyeongchang Games. Here\u2019s a look at some of their favorites photos.\n\nImage Jamie Anderson of the United States won silver in snowboard big air on Thursday morning. Credit Hilary Swift for The New York Times\n\nIn the newest Olympic sport, big air, athletes shoot down a 49-meter-high hill and launch themselves off a ramp. The sport consists of that one jump and as many tricks athletes can fit into their time in the sky. It\u2019s called big air for a reason.\n\nJamie Anderson of the United States won the silver medal. Earlier in the week, she won a gold in slopestyle snowboarding.\n\nImage Shaun White competing at the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics. Credit Chang W. Lee/The New York Times\n\nHalfpipe snowboarders and skiers have more than one chance to go skyward. While traveling down the 170-meter halfpipe, athletes sail \u2014 sometimes over 20 feet above the rim \u2014 to perform a variety of tricks. They are judged on the degree of difficulty, height and technique.\n\nAmerican Shaun White won his third gold in the halfpipe. His third run was nearly flawless, and included a frontside double cork 1440 followed by a cab double cork 1440. Trust us, that\u2019s really hard.\n\nImage Cassie Sharpe of Canada won the gold in ski halfpipe. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times\n\nHalfpipe skiers are judged on the number of turns, snowboarders are judged on the number of rotations. So these athletes don\u2019t need to just get themselves in the air. To win, they need to stay there for as long as they can to complete their run.\n\nCanada\u2019s Cassie Sharpe won the gold medal in the ski halfpipe with a run that included back-to-back 900s and a cork 1080.\n\nImage Yuzuru Hanyu during his free skate.

Each jump is worth a certain number of points based on the degree of difficultly, and judges frequently watch slow motion replays of routines to make sure rotations are properly noted.\n\nJapanese gold medalist Yuzuru Hanyu performed quad salchows and quad toe loops, earning his second consecutive gold medal.\n\nImage Alina Zagitova skated her way to the gold medal in the free skating program of women\u2019s skating competition at the Pyeongchang Games.

Giant illuminated pandas roller-bladed around. And then, at least according to the guidebook, the pandas flew back to Beijing through the internet.\n\nPhoto\n\nK-Pop Takes a Turn\n\nTime for K-pop! CL sang the pseudo hip-hop song \u201cThe Baddest Female\u201d and \u201cI Am the Best,\u201d with torches and dancers. The crowd hit its highest level of excitement so far. And then some ritual. The national anthem of Greece. The flag of Greece was raised. The Olympic anthem. The Olympic flag was lowered and handed over to the mayor of Beijing, host of the 2022 Games. The national anthem of China. And that meant it was time for a segment devoted to Beijing. Yes, with pandas!\n\nPhoto\n\nVisual Spectacle and Some Math\n\nNext a somewhat abstract look at time. Some base 60 numbers were projected. It was a bit hard to understand, but the ceremony guidebook clarified: \u201cWhen the number becomes zero, the people of the future break free from the existing time and space, and arrive at a world no longer bound by gravity.\u201d And \u201cThe Axis of New Time set a new orbit of time in motion, and despite the fluid nature of the orbit, it reformulates itself by discovering and creating a new order.\u201d Thousands of moving lights and dancers made for a fine visual spectacle if not a crystal clear one.\n\nPhoto\n\nCross-Country Medalists Share the Stage\n\nTraditionally a victory ceremony or two is held at the closing ceremony. Here it was the men\u2019s and women\u2019s mass start cross-country races. Marit Bjoergen of Norway accepted her mind-boggling eighth gold medal and Iivo Niskanen of Finland his second. Thomas Bach of the IOC was on hand and was introduced for a second time as a former fencing gold medalist. In English and French. In French, fencing is \u201cescrime.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nNorth Korea and South Korea Carry Their Own Flags\n\nRather than carrying the unified flag that was seen throughout the Games, South and North Korea each carried in their own flag: speedskater Lee Seung-hoon carried South Korea, and Kim Ju-sik of pairs figure skating, carried North Korea.\n\nOn the stage, a mournful and reflective moment; a tribute to those who have died, led by a turtle and giant puppets. The puppets were kkoktu, used at funerals to guide the dead to the next world. Marchers carried dandelion seeds, symbolic of life arising from death. Turtles are said to carry messages from humans to the gods.\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Parade of Flags, Minus One\n\nNext up was the parade of flags, with each nation carried by one of its own Olympic heroes. Except for Russia, whose flag has been banner non grata at the Games. Ester Ledecka (Czech Republic), Jessie Diggins (U.S.), Marit Bjoergen (Norway), Ireen Wust (Netherlands) and Javier Fernandez (Spain) are among those who earned the honor.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd then came the mass of athletes, entering in no particular order rather than strictly by nation as in the closing ceremony. This entry was scheduled to take 20 minutes, although at other Olympics it has often gone on much longer. There were a record 2,920 athletes at these Games.\n\nThe Canadian delegation marched in on a high, with many athletes wearing their medals around their necks. They had their best Winter Olympics performance ever \u2014 winning 29 medals in total, 11 gold. You\u2019ll notice less athletes in the closing ceremony than you did in the opening ceremony. Many athletes \u2014 and most of the biggest name athletes \u2014 travel back home after their events. But the last event of the Olympics concluded just 3 hours before the closing ceremony. So if you see any athletes limping just a little, they may have participated in this afternoon\u2019s 30 kilometer cross-country skiing race.\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nA Blending of Traditional and Rock Music\n\nJang Sa-ik and a group of children got the South Korean national anthem assignment. The anthem was accompanied not by an orchestra but by a single marimba, a xylophone-like instrument. And then Yang Tae-Hwan, 13, completely shredded Vivaldi\u2019s the Four Seasons (Winter, naturally) in a rock guitar arrangement, as performers in glowing suits cavorted. Eighty traditional Korean instruments, geomungos, a kind of zither, were then mixed with the rock \u2014 the meeting of old and new. A prayer pagoda rose from the stage to cap the opening number.\n\nPhoto\n\nA Colorful Introduction and a Handshake\n\nIn a colorful intro, young skiers and skaters on wheels dashed onto the circular stage that filled the pentagonal stadium. There was heavy use of light projections on the stage. President Moon Jae-in of South Korea and Thomas Bach of the I.O.C. arrived and shook hands with Ivanka Trump among others. They were presented with snow globes by two children. Their significance? They were each born on July 7, 2011, the day Pyeongchang was awarded the Games.\n\nIt was 35 degrees in the Pyeongchang Olympic Stadium.

The report was changed to make clear the two failed drugs tests were not part of a systematic doping scheme involving the Russian Olympic Committee.\n\nTwo investigations revealed that Russia\u2019s doping program had tainted scores of athletes and multiple sporting events across several years.

Putin of Russia and other top sports officials from the country have denied that the doping program reached the highest levels of their government.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe effects of the scandal have disrupted the last two Games, shifting attention from athletics to litigation. Before the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, where Russia participated as a nation while some of its athletes were banned because of the scandal, the country tried to use the sports courts to increase its number of participants. It made a similar effort in the final days leading up to these Winter Olympics.

She was the second Russian to fail a drug test here. When the I.O.C. banned Russia on Dec. 5, the organization said a condition of the country\u2019s reinstatement would be a commitment to global antidoping regulations. Russia was also required to pay a $15 million fine.\n\n\u201cThis is not a decision everyone will be happy with,\u201d Hoevertsz said after Sunday\u2019s vote. \u201cWe will be criticized.\u201d\n\nThe decision to potentially reinstate Russia met skepticism on Sunday, with critics pointing to retests of doping samples conducted years after the 2008 and 2012 Summer Olympics. In those tests, Russian athletes had the most confirmed cases at both Games, according to the I.O.C.\u2019s own statistics (18 out of 65 from Beijing 2008; 21 out of 49 from London 2012)\n\n\u201cIf the retests shows the result then the I.O.C will take the appropriate measures,\u201d Bach said at a news conference Sunday afternoon, without elaborating.\n\nRichard Pound, the I.O.C.\u2019s longest-serving member, skipped the meeting in protest of what he considered to be lenient treatment of Russia. Adam Pengilly, a British member who also has been critical of the I.O.C.\u2019s reaction to the Russia scandal, was sent home from the Games after an altercation with a security guard.\n\nAfter being warned that their conduct would affect the I.O.C.\u2019s decision, Russian athletes have largely been keeping a low profile in South Korea. They have generally stayed off social media and refrained from making critical comments or displaying nationalistic symbols.\n\nThe two failed drugs tests were not part of a systematic doping scheme, the panel said.

It seems to have worked. Two of the women ended up on top of an Olympic podium at these Games and two more came close.\n\nThey also worked together to persuade the International Ski Federation to support them. Randall and Finland\u2019s Aino-Kaisa Saarinen were able to get federation officials to provide credentials for caregivers and to find space for baby rooms \u2014 stocked with diapers and toys \u2014 that doubled as a warm place for children and the people watching over them during long events.\n\n\u201cMen can have families, and they don\u2019t ever have to miss a single race,\u201d said Randall, who has pink highlights in her blond hair and is as ripped as a ninja warrior. \u201cKnowing we were all having babies, we lobbied to have some support for moms that first season back. It\u2019s the first time the international federation has provided that kind of support.\u201d\n\nWhile those changes helped, all of the other mothers lived in Europe and didn\u2019t face the same challenges Randall did in packing up her family and traveling for six months out of the year. For Randall, the only way to make the ski season successful as both an athlete and a parent was to enlist the support of her teammates.\n\nTheir buy-in was never in doubt. Randall has long been at the elite level of cross-country skiing, and several of her current teammates idolized her when they were teenagers. The goal was for Randall to spend time training with the team and still be there for her family. It helped that her husband, Jeff Ellis, a former Canadian ski racer, worked as a media coordinator for the International Ski Federation. Both sets of grandparents have also provided extensive caregiving during the racing season.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWe made this deal where I wanted to be as much a part of the team as I could, but I didn\u2019t want to be disruptive to the athletes,\u201d Randall said. \u201cKids bring extra germs, and he might be crying at night.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter talking with the coaches, her family adopted ground rules \u2014 sitting at separate tables in the dining hall to allow the athletes to decide how much or how little they wanted to interact with the baby. Randall and her family stayed in separate quarters, but sometimes those rooms were still within earshot of teammates, creating extra worry about whether a crying baby might wake someone up.\n\nThere were bumps in the road. It took a month for Breck to adjust to the time difference in Europe, resulting in multiple wake-ups at night. And it was also a challenge to be on the road with a growing baby. \u201cThere was a lot of gear,\u201d Randall said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

That part I hadn\u2019t anticipated,\u201d she said.\n\nHer teammate Diggins said the cross-country team knew that having a baby along during training and competition wouldn\u2019t always be ideal. Sometimes the Americans stayed in small hotels with thin walls, and team members would hear Breck crying in the middle of the night or when they were trying to nap, she said, speaking last fall at an event in Park City, Utah.\n\nBut Diggins said the team didn\u2019t want Randall to have to choose between being a mother and being a world-class skier, and they wanted to help her create something approaching a work-life balance. \u201cWomen shouldn\u2019t have to choose,\u201d Diggins said. \u201cThis team only works when everyone buys in.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAnd there were benefits to having Breck along for the ride, said Sadie Bjornsen, another team member. Bjornsen, who calls herself a \u201csucker for kids,\u201d said playing with Breck on the road helped keep her from thinking about skiing every waking hour.\n\n\u201cSometimes I will come in after a race and be bummed out about how I\u2019ve done, and I\u2019ll just go over and hug Breck, and it will make me feel better,\u201d she said.\n\nRandall, who plans to retire after this Olympics, recently won election to the International Olympic Committee Athletes\u2019 Commission. She hopes she can use her experience as a mother and an athlete to help other Olympic families.\n\nIn the end, she did not bring her son to the Olympics because the cost was so prohibitive. Instead, Breck stayed in Toronto with her husband\u2019s parents, and the separation was painful, said Randall. She said she wanted to work with the I.O.C. to create affordable housing for family members at future Olympics.\n\nShe hopes that seeing women like herself and Bjorgen on the Olympic podium will convince a new generation of athletes that it doesn\u2019t have to choose between an Olympic medal and motherhood. In fact, she asserted, the two can work well together.

In the women\u2019s downhill, Alice McKennis was fifth and Breezy Johnson was seventh. Over all, if you add their teammates Laurenne Ross and Alice Merryweather, there were seven top 20 finishes at the Pyeongchang Olympics by American women not named Vonn or Shiffrin.\n\nAnd another top woman on the United States team, Jacqueline Wiles, missed these Winter Games when she was injured in a heartbreaking crash on the final weekend of racing before the 2018 Olympics were to start. Wiles was third in a World Cup downhill late last month.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut on the men\u2019s side, things were more bleak.

Days earlier, Ligety had the highest finish by an American man at the Pyeongchang Games when he was fifth in the Alpine combined. The American men\u2019s team was without one of its top performers in Travis Ganong, who is injured. The 36-year-old veteran Steven Nyman was also sidelined.\n\nStill, Ligety\u2019s fifth place was the only top 10 result by an American man here.

Ryan Cochran-Siegle, who is the son of the 1972 American Olympic gold medalist Barbara Cochran, had the third fastest time in the field in the second run of the giant slalom. Cochran-Siegle was participating in his first Olympics, and finished 11th, but even one blistering run on a big stage can propel a budding career.

Radamus, 19, has been near the top of the overall standings on what amounts to ski racing\u2019s minor league circuit for most of this winter.

It was the first gold medal for Finland at the Games, and the first medal of any kind for a Finnish man.\n\n\u201cIt's a big deal for us, I saw the list,\u201d Niskanen said. \u201cThe last Olympic champion in an individual race was 20 years ago.\"\n\nSwitzerland Wins Team Skiing Event\n\nA two-man, two-woman Swiss team out-skied Austria in the final of the Alpine team event. The new event featured four head-to-head matchups down a short slalom course with a small jump. Wendy Holdener of the winning team picked up her third medal of the Games and Ramon Zenhausern his second.\n\nNorway won the bronze. A United States team without any of its Alpine stars was eliminated by Britain in the round of 16.\n\nHere\u2019s What You Missed\n\nKjeld Nuis of the Netherlands, the 1,500-meter winner, edged Havard Lorentzen of Norway, the 500-meter winner, in the men\u2019s 1,000-meter speedskating race. It was the seventh gold medal for the Netherlands out of 12 events so far.\n\nThe old rivals Norway and Sweden headed into the final shooting segment of the men\u2019s biathlon relay locked in a battle for first. Fredrik Lindstroem of Sweden missed just once. But Emil Svendsen of Norway, whose poor shooting at the end dropped Norway from first to fourth four years ago, missed three times. As a consolation, this time it only dropped Norway from first to second, rather than fourth.\n\nIn a thrilling end to a battle between the sport\u2019s superpowers, the United States beat Canada by a score of 3-2 in a shootout to win the gold medal in women\u2019s ice hockey . Jocelyne Lamoureux-Davidson\u2019s goal in the sixth round of the shootout sealed the victory for the Americans, giving the team its first gold in the event since 1998.\n\nAlina Zagitova of Russia won the Olympic gold medal in women\u2019s figure skating, edging out her countrywoman, Evgenia Medvedeva.

People of all skill levels can get into winter sports like figure skating, bobsledding and, yes, even curling. Here\u2019s how. Image Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times\n\nThere\u2019s a familiar refrain heard in living rooms around the world during the Olympic Games: \u201cI could do that.\u201d Eye rolls usually follow. But if you are watching the Games and wondering if you can follow in the footsteps of those athletes, here\u2019s a way to get started.\n\nFirst, you\u2019ll have to check your ego at the door. You most likely will not be able to nail a chicken salad grab (yes, that\u2019s really what it\u2019s called) on the halfpipe or do a double full twist as an aerial ski jumper. With a humble approach, you can start chasing down your own Olympic, or recreational, dreams.\n\nImage Chris Mazdzer on his way to a silver-medal finish in the men\u2019s luge. Credit James Hill for The New York Times\n\nLuge\n\nThe U.S. Luge team runs \u201cslider searches\u201d introducing children ages 9 to 13 to the sport. Participants are taught the basics of using a sled and then take several runs down a paved luge course on a sled with wheels. The young athletes that show the most potential are invited to try luge on ice at a training site.\n\nDon\u2019t quite fit into that age demographic? There are luge tracks and clinics open to all ages.\n\nMichigan is home to two clubs and tracks for lugeing enthusiasts. The Upper Peninsula Luge Club has a natural track and the Muskegon Winter Sports Complex has a track built like the ones you see in the Olympics. Mere mortals can attempt a run at both sites. There are also courses in Utah and New York.\n\nBut don\u2019t expect to go too fast, or be able to progress too quickly. At the highest level, athletes move at 85 miles per hour. It takes a lot of training to get to that speed and precision safely.\n\nImage Kaillie Humphries and Phylicia George of Canada during training heats on Monday in Pyeongchang. The two-man event is the only bobsled competition in which women can participate at the Olympics. Credit Jeffrey Furticella/The New York Times\n\nBobsled\n\nWant the exhilaration of a sliding sport without any of the training or danger? That\u2019s an option too. Many sliding centers offer visitors the opportunity to ride in a bobsled with a pilot.\n\nBut the jolting ride will cost you \u2014 the Whistler Sliding Centre in British Columbia charges $179 per rider. The Lake Placid bobsled experience goes for $95, which includes a team shirt and 20 percent off your second bobsled ride.\n\nIf you want to take up the sport beyond a ride, Utah Olympic Park has a bobsled driving school. And U.S. Bobsled and Skeleton is always looking for new athletes: The federation hosts combines for prospective athletes.\n\nAdrenaline junkies rejoice.\n\nImage Alina Zagitova during the free skate. Credit Doug Mills/The New York Times\n\nFigure Skating\n\nThe back-to-back figure skating gold medalist Yuzuru Hanyu makes it look easy. Don\u2019t be fooled \u2014 the ice rink can bring you to your knees, quite literally. Most people need to use something like a walker when they first try ice skating.\n\nMany ice rinks around the United States offer lessons and courses for a range of aspiring athletes. In New York City, Chelsea Piers offers year round classes for skaters ranging from 3-year-olds to adults.\n\nMany local parks and community centers around the country offer ice skating too, with a sliding scale of admission and rental charges. Even better? Skating on frozen lakes and ponds. But don\u2019t forget \u2014 without a Zamboni, it may be a bumpier ride.\n\nImage Chloe Kim, 17, outsoared her rivals to win the gold medal in the snowboard halfpipe. Credit Chang W. Lee/The New York Times\n\nSkiing and Snowboarding\n\nHalfpipe snowboarding, slopestyle skiing and aerials have all gained notoriety as some of the flashier sports at the Games, but no one is born able to do those brilliant flying acrobatics.\n\nBefore even thinking of attempting a run at an X-Games sport, you should be comfortable with your winter gear. Wirecutter, The New York Times\u2019s product review site, has a rundown of the best apparel and accessories for enjoying the snow. Next, you\u2019ll need skis or a snowboard, preferably something designed for beginners. That gear may shift as you progress in the sport, but moving from learning how to snowboard to attempting the halfpipe is a long road.\n\nSome camps and clinics exist to help would-be winter athletes make the transition from laid-back skiers who can take lessons at any ski resort to athletes who want to strive for time, style and better performance.\n\nIn Canada, the North Toronto Ski Club has specialized clinics, including halfpipe, slopestyle and moguls. Okemo Mountain in Vermont has programs specifically for freestyle snowboarding and skiing.\n\nImage Shani Davis of the United States won silver in the men\u2019s 1500 meters in both Vancouver and Turin. But in Pyeongchang he finished 19th. Credit James Hill for The New York Times\n\nSpeedskating\n\nLooking as graceful as the world\u2019s best speedskaters takes time. But if you are an experienced in-line skater, you already have a head start. Erin Jackson, a United States Olympian, transitioned from in-line skating to speedskating just months before qualifying for the Pyeongchang Games.\n\nMs. Jackson trained in Florida, home of a vibrant speedskating community (you read that correctly). But there are clubs across the United States and Canada, many of which host classes and clinics. One of the premier speedskating rinks in the country is the Pettit Center in Milwaukee, home of the U.S. Olympic trials in January. The center has a speedskating school divided by age and ability.\n\nImage Kevin Koe in Canada's semifinal against the United States. Credit Jeffrey Furticella/The New York Times\n\nCurling\n\nWant to slow down a bit? Try curling.\n\nThe sport is growing across the United States as more venues start offering classes and starting leagues. There are curling leagues across the country, with vibrant clubs everywhere from Tampa, Fla., to St. Paul, Minn.\n\nThe biggest leagues are concentrated in the Midwest. The Duluth Curling Club of Northern Minnesota encourages new members and offers free lessons. The Milwaukee Curling Club in Wisconsin also offers curling lessons, but most of the dates stretching a month in advance are already sold out.", "keywords": ["credit", "athletes", "olympic", "bobsled", "sport", "luge", "states", "united", "winter", "york", "skating", "started"], "polarity": 0.2049961641733794, "subjectivity": 0.44320099731492124},
