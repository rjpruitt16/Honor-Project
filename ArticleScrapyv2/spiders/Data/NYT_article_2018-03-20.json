In 1983, Paule Marshall, best known for her novel \u201cBrown Girl, Brownstones,\u201d reflected on how observing her mother\u2019s relationship to language inspired her career. An excerpt follows.\n\nI grew up among poets. Now they didn\u2019t look like poets \u2014 whatever that breed is supposed to look like. Nothing about them suggested that poetry was their calling. They were just a group of ordinary housewives and mothers, my mother included, who dressed in a way (shapeless housedresses, dowdy felt hats and long, dark, solemn coats) that made it impossible for me to imagine they had ever been young.\n\nNor did they do what poets were supposed to do \u2014 spend their days in an attic room writing verses. Several mornings a week these unknown bards would put an apron and a pair of old house shoes in a shopping bag and take the train or streetcar from our section of Brooklyn out to Flatbush. There, those who didn\u2019t have steady jobs would wait on certain designated corners for the white housewives in the neighborhood to come along and bargain with them over pay for a day\u2019s work cleaning their houses. Later, armed with the few dollars they had earned, which in their vocabulary became \u201ca few raw-mouth pennies,\u201d they made their way back to our neighborhood, where they would sometimes stop off to have a cup of tea or cocoa together before going home to cook dinner for their husbands and children.\n\nThere was no way for me to understand it at the time, but the talk that filled the kitchen those afternoons was highly functional. It served as therapy, the cheapest kind available to my mother and her friends. It restored them to a sense of themselves and reaffirmed their self-worth. Through language they were able to overcome the humiliations of the work day. Confronted by a world they could not encompass, they took refuge in language.\n\nThey taught me my first lessons in the narrative art. They trained my ear. They set a standard of excellence. This is why the best of my work must be attributed to them; it stands as testimony to the rich legacy of language and culture they so freely passed on to me in the wordshop of the kitchen.", "keywords": ["mother", "book", "supposed", "look", "work", "way", "neighborhood", "poets", "language", "mothers", "notes", "review", "archives", "ordinary"], "polarity": 0.106871921182266, "subjectivity": 0.42137110016420365},

HOW TO SLAY By Constance C. R. White. (Rizzoli, $55.) White explores the rich history of African-American style and taste, from Josephine Baker and Diana Ross to Rihanna and Lupita Nyong\u2019o.

So I escaped into the past, reading NELLIE BLY, an acclaimed 1994 biography by Brooke Kroeger, and then Bly\u2019s actual stories, filled with stunts and derring-do. Self-trained, Bly was not a master craftswoman: Her writing could flirt both with tedium and turgidity. Some stories seemed more truthy than truthful. But what stories! By the time she turned 26, Bly had gone undercover as a mental patient in New York, exposed corruption in the state capital and traveled the world in 72 days, a great feat at the time. She changed that world in small ways and opened the door for other women to follow.

What books made you fall in love with poetry?\n\nI had a big reading textbook in fifth grade, which I\u2019d race ahead in and find \u2014 to my great excitement \u2014 brief poems by poets like Emily Dickinson and Gwendolyn Brooks. When I was growing up, my father had a series of books whose titles began \u201cThe Works of \u2026.\u201d Without making a lot of fuss about them, or worrying over the literal sense of them, I read sonnets by Shakespeare and poems by Poe, and loved the feeling that those works created in me. I felt from an early age that poetry was something mysterious, something playful and lilting. As I got older, poems began to offer me new and life-changing ways of looking at the familiar world.\n\nWas there a book of poems or a poet in particular that inspired you to write?\n\nSeamus Heaney\u2019s first book, \u201cDeath of a Naturalist,\u201d made me want to be a poet. More than that, it made me want to be Seamus Heaney, and I imitated him for a long time. I was his student as an undergraduate, and that whole time I was, at least in my heart, imitating him. He was kind and generous enough to guide me gently toward what he recognized as intimations of my own voice and subject matter.\n\nWhich poets continue to inspire you?\n\nLucille Clifton and Elizabeth Bishop are never-ending sources of anchoring and astonishment for me as a poet. The more I read them, the more their poems seem to accomplish. I\u2019m co-translating the contemporary Chinese poet Yi Lei, and her vision of freedom and love, her concerns for humanity and for the planet speak very actively to my own. I\u2019m learning a great deal from living with her voice and her imagination.\n\nAre there poets for whom you\u2019ve gained greater appreciation over time?\n\nWhen I first became brave enough to tell people that I wrote poems, so many people would rave to me about Edna St. Vincent Millay\u2019s work. I was embarrassed not to have read her and I think that put me off from reading her for a long time. So many of her poems are just impeccable. I love the subtlety and the tiny, yet significant, gestures driving poems like \u201cEbb\u201d and \u201cThe Fitting.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

What books do you recommend to them? And have they in turn pointed you to any neglected or unfamiliar writers?\n\nI find myself sharing poems by other poets on these trips, which is something I didn\u2019t used to do at readings. Some of the voices I\u2019ve been excited to celebrate so far are Natalie Diaz, Aracelis Girmay, John Yau, Patrick Rosal, Laura Kasischke and Chen Chen. I like that these are poets living and writing in America today, each with different thematic concerns, different approaches to language and different ideas about what it means to belong to this place made up of many places. And I feel very lucky that I get to meet other poets in my travels. In New Mexico, I met dg okpik, an Inupiaq-Inuit poet whose work draws Inuit creation stories into conversation with a personal exploration of self, family and the natural world. And I read recently with Kealoha, the poet laureate of Hawaii, whose performance piece \u201cThe Story of Everything\u201d traces the origin of the universe from the Big Bang until now.\n\nIf you had to name one book that made you who you are today, what would it be?\n\n\u201cLittle Women\u201d made me into a reader. About a decade later, I wrote one of my college admissions essays on Thoreau\u2019s \u201cWalden.\u201d I have no memory of what I might have said then about the book, though I do remember loving its various paradoxes and the beautiful spacious sense of self, nature and possibility that the prose fostered. I was longing for the kind of largeness of spirit and rhetorical authority of a writer like Thoreau. I didn\u2019t encounter Emerson until college, but I think I was an aspiring Transcendentalist from a young age.\n\nWhat genres do you especially enjoy reading? And which do you avoid?\n\nI have three kids, so children\u2019s literature is a big part of my life. At one time, I thought I\u2019d raise my kids on the classic books from my childhood: \u201cLittle House in the Big Woods,\u201d Beverly Cleary\u2019s wonderful Ramona books, \u201cBlack Beauty.\u201d It\u2019s been great to revisit some of those titles as a parent, but my children have guided me to the joys of contemporary children\u2019s literature. Jacqueline Woodson\u2019s books are such a gift to parents and children for their poignant subtlety and lyricism, and their willingness to let a reader dwell in the pangs of realization that we sometimes try to protect our children from. I\u2019m thinking of \u201cEach Kindness\u201d and \u201cThe Other Side.\u201d My daughter is 8 and loves the way that private and public history intersect in \u201cFeathers.\u201d Many picture books have fostered inroads for talking with our kids about history: Margaret H. Mason\u2019s \u201cThese Hands\u201d tells the story of racial discrimination at the Wonder Bread factory in the 1950s and \u201960s. Selina Alko\u2019s \u201cThe Case for Loving\u201d tells the story behind the Supreme Court\u2019s Loving v. Virginia decision. And then there are books that have given us a wonderfully useful vocabulary for feelings of anger or longing, like Barbara O\u2019Connor\u2019s \u201cWish.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nI have to say that I just haven\u2019t found a way to get excited about \u201cHarry Potter,\u201d though my daughter and husband loved the series. I loved C. S. Lewis as a kid, so I thought I\u2019d have a toehold in that world, but invariably I\u2019d get about two paragraphs in and fall asleep. Maybe I\u2019ll be ready to face those books in a few more years when they come around for our boys.\n\nWhat books might we be surprised to find on your shelves?\n\nPerhaps because I\u2019ve lost both my parents, I really appreciate Elisabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross\u2019s books on death and dying.\n\nWhat do you plan to read next?\n\nEmily Wilson\u2019s translation of \u201cThe Odyssey.\u201d", "keywords": ["book", "big", "k", "poets", "poems", "books", "id", "read", "loving", "poet", "smith", "tracy", "reading"], "polarity": 0.23049761686125333, "subjectivity": 0.4975381520836067},

Le Guin\n\n215 pp. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. $22.\n\nPhoto\n\nLe Guin (who died in January) has written before about the genre for which she is best known, and explains herein that \u201cthe fantastic tale may suspend the laws of physics \u2026 but it carries its revolt against reality no further.\u201d That is, the author of fantasy must have a sharp understanding of emotional, social and political realities. Such intelligence gleams in these essays, culled from several years of blog posts. Le Guin claims the form \u201csounds like a sodden tree trunk in a bog\u201d and calls her own attempts \u201cmore trivially personal\u201d than those that inspired her. But the trivially personal is a chief pleasure of this collection, which uses its firm footing in the concrete world to ponder an eclectic array of topics. The pages sparkle with lines that make a reader glance up, searching for an available ear with which to share them.\n\n\u201cOld age is for anybody who gets there,\u201d Le Guin asserts in a scorching section about aging, while two others describe the travails of her cat, Pard, with less irony than J. R. Ackerley\u2019s memoir of his dog, Tulip, but no less charm. Other sections meander from the nature of belief, Homer and the obsolete nature of the Great American Novel to domestic studies like the relocation of a rattlesnake from her own yard to that of the millionaire down the street.\n\nThe strongest essays narrow themselves to Le Guin\u2019s fervent obsession with language. In \u201cHaving My Cake,\u201d a contemplation of her difficulty understanding proverbs becomes a syntax-shuffling close reading of the one in the title. This linguistic gnawing is one of the book\u2019s great delights. \u201cWords fascinate me,\u201d she explains, \u201cthe way box elder beetles fascinate my friend Pard,\u201d who will \u201cstare unmoving for 10 minutes at the unattainable light fixture in which a beetle is visible as a tiny moving silhouette.\u201d Images as simple and striking as this or the \u201csmall but violent\u201d LED lights on a Christmas tree become grand observations on the nature of writing and living. \u201cWords are my skein of yarn, my lump of wet clay, my block of uncarved wood,\u201d she explains, and then quietly astounds us with the carving.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nI WROTE THIS BECAUSE I LOVE YOU\n\nEssays\n\nBy Tim Kreider\n\n206 pp. Simon & Schuster. $26.\n\nPhoto\n\nKreider, a political cartoonist and essayist, has indeed written this book because he loves you. Or rather, because he has loved some women and one cat, and learned a few things along the way. In a style reminiscent of Orwell, E. B. White and David Sedaris, an affable hero gamely bumbles through adventures rich with moments of fleeting profundity and moral reckoning. He follows a manic circus tutor on a train to Mexico, falls for a fellow cartoonist amid the early aughts\u2019 war on terror and trysts with a politically enlightened prostitute. These stories entertain, though I prefer him being wittily deprecated by his female companions to his drawing binaries between \u201c\u2018Type A\u2019: smart, pretty, sane, moral girls with glasses who tended to work for nonprofits or write\u201d and \u201cbawdy dominatrices\u201d (to be fair, this reviewer is a Type A, former bawdy dominatrix who writes). But his depictions of the arc from ignorance to wisdom are reliably deft.

Describing the emotional rush of an evening spent colluding and conjoining, she sounds as if she has a new crush: \u201cI related to every single thing she said,\u201d Schaefer tells us, reporting that they discussed \u201cthings I don\u2019t typically share with someone I\u2019m just sitting down with for the first time.\u201d She gushes to her mother via text the next day: \u201cI have a new best friend. \u2026 I love her.\u201d\n\nIn a year that has been described as a women\u2019s renaissance, female friendship feels particularly worthy of contemplation. As professional opportunities broaden and cultural attitudes shift, competition between women has given way to allyship. Through the return of women\u2019s social organizations and the formalization of whisper networks, female solidarity is more pervasive than ever, a byproduct of girl power and the cumulation of years of quiet rebellion.\n\n\u201cWomen are stepping up together, loudly and publicly,\u201d writes Schaefer, a journalist whose subjects have ranged from the Korean beauty industry to the occult. It seems the world is finally recognizing the power of female connection, which the poet Adrienne Rich once described as \u201cthe most feared, the most problematic and the most potentially transforming force on the planet.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhat girl hasn\u2019t buzzed with the rare thrill of a new friendship? It offers a shared hiding place and a secret understanding outside the reach of men, parents, employers; someone who hates everything you hate, who takes on your causes as her own; someone who, after leaving you at the end of the night, cares that you get home safely.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn many of our lives, friendships matter as much as romantic relationships. Friends are our soul mates \u2014 and, more practically, our emergency contacts. Why then, Schaefer asks, is friendship as an institution not afforded the same benefits and privileges as marriage? It\u2019s a position that has been gaining steam in the legal community, among advocates of so-called friendship law like Rachel Moran, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has argued that platonic bonds ought to matter \u201cnot only in my own intimate life, but in the eyes of the law.\u201d", "keywords": ["action", "potential", "womens", "schaefer", "girl", "text", "matter", "friendship", "romantic", "law", "female", "power", "squads"], "polarity": 0.14661102786102786, "subjectivity": 0.47259892884892873},

Alizadeh raps, \u201cLet me scream, I\u2019m tired of silence,\u201d while lifting a Western-style wedding veil. Beneath it her face is made up to look as if she\u2019s been beaten: swollen eyes and bruised jaw. It\u2019s a powerful image, one that Bagieu doesn\u2019t hesitate to draw into the strip.\n\nVideo\n\nAnd Bagieu\u2019s drawings are wonderful. Though sometimes spare, with minimal effort spent on backgrounds, her line manages to flow and skate through 29 stories of remarkable women. These drawings can act. They are alive with gestural attitude. They move, dance, struggle, fight back, fall in love, resist and wonder at the world. Some ham it up. Some suffer terrible abuse. To her credit, Bagieu doesn\u2019t back away from drawing the marks of violence on their faces and their bodies, which may come as a surprise to those who are expecting a rah-rah young adult girl-power sort of read.\n\nBagieu calls these comics \u201cbroad stroke portraits,\u201d and explains the sometimes too breezy storytelling this way: \u201cThis book is by no means a thorough scholarly work; rather, it\u2019s one woman\u2019s tribute \u2014 my homage to the full, daring lives they lead, often against great odds.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAll of her stories follow a similar pattern. Almost every page has nine frames and each biography begins with a portrait drawn in a beribboned oval template. They cover the birth, life and death of each of her subjects in a way that can feel a bit formulaic, but this seems to have more to do with the fact that the English translation is typeset rather than in Bagieu\u2019s handwriting.\n\nIn the original version of these strips, which are luckily available in French on the Le Monde website, where they originally appeared, the difference is instantly apparent. The nature of handwriting gives the portraits a more personal \u201cvoice.\u201d It feels as if Bagieu herself is telling you these stories. They lose their Wikipedia tone and become more intimate, more like that of a cool fairy godmother recounting tales you need to hear without too much worry about sources, originality or historical accuracy. Her handwriting preserves her passion, along with clear intent to both delight and embolden the reader.\n\nPhoto\n\nIt\u2019s painful to see this crucial part of her work replaced with type. It changes everything about how the stories are received. The reading speed is altered. The tone and the visual relationship between the text and the drawing just isn\u2019t there. It\u2019s her handwriting that makes these panels spring to life. Panels that seemed awkwardly composed suddenly become elegant and beautifully balanced. It\u2019s hard for people to understand the importance of a cartoonist\u2019s handwriting. In the same way melody transforms lyrics, handwriting transforms words and can have a profound impact on how the story is received and understood.\n\nSadly, nearly every scrap of Bagieu\u2019s lovely handwriting has been scrubbed and replaced in this translation, even when completely unnecessary. The only clue to this \u201cvoice\u201d is a rare lettered sign here and there, and her name, \u201cP\u00e9n\u00e9lope,\u201d sweetly signed at the end of each strip.\n\nThese \u201crebel ladies\u201d come from all over the world (though surprisingly over a third of them are American). They also come from all points in time, like Agnodice, whom Bagieu presents as a gutsy gynecologist from ancient Greece, to the astronaut Mae Jemison (the one with the tight Afro), to the \u201cAnimal Whisperer\u201d Temple Grandin and the \u201cLover of Modern Art\u201d Peggy Guggenheim (she\u2019s the one with the wild sunglasses). Bagieu includes sets of siblings, like the Wiggins sisters, who were forced by their father to form a rock band called \u201cThe Shaggs,\u201d and \u201cLas Mariposas,\u201d the Dominican Republic\u2019s Mirabel sisters, who were murdered during the Trujillo regime in 1960. And she profiles too one of my favorite women, Frances Glessner Lee, who helped crime scene investigators hone their craft by creating intensely accurate miniature replicas of rooms where murders took place.\n\nBagieu has dedicated this book to her own daughters, and I kept that in mind as I read it. When I imagine her telling these stories to them, I\u2019m reminded of something my grandmother would say when she told me these kinds of tales. \u201cOf course it is only a story my dear. But it is true!\u201d Bagieu\u2019s pen transforms these true stories into something that has the tone of a personalized fairy tale.

Some of Lazarin\u2019s stories \u2014 not coincidentally, my favorites \u2014 show women pinging furiously off one another instead of their boyfriends, husbands and fathers, gathering incremental surges of strength and autonomy and rage, of unspoken power. In \u201cThe Holographic Soul,\u201d two young sisters playact a psychic guessing game, then try to actually access their powers, longing for a presence to manifest itself and give them something solid on which to pin their anxieties. The two teenage friends in \u201cGone\u201d keep a list of real-life dead girls, sharing their fear as puberty descends. (\u201cGirls are taught to be discreet,\u201d Lazarin writes in a later story. \u201cBoys, who shout their own terror, make a mess of it, take you down with them.\u201d)\n\nPhoto\n\nIt\u2019s easy to anticipate criticism of \u201cBack Talk\u201d and its quietly realist, \u201cliterary\u201d writing. It won\u2019t help to note that Lazarin\u2019s characters are educated and middle- to upper-class, that her stories are often set in New York and Paris. They are, certainly, beautifully crafted. I loathe the word \u201cpolished\u201d in the context of prose. It\u2019s too clinical, implying that the work was dull before the author intentionally spruced it up. So I\u2019d prefer to say that the sentences in these stories are living and seamless, as if Lazarin had run her hand over them until they became smooth and gleaming with the evidence of her touch.

Although Lazarin\u2019s work has the tone and style of traditional mainstream short fiction, it joins a growing canon of quietly realist stories that establish women\u2019s experiences as worthy of literary attention. And not just women\u2019s experiences: These stories also explore the exhausting, slow poison of masculine power, the grind of the patriarchy on even the most privileged of women, the subtle ways in which men have trained women to minimize themselves.\n\nThe hunger for these types of stories is powerful. How else to explain the ferocious explosion of emotion aroused by Kristen Roupenian\u2019s New Yorker story \u201cCat Person\u201d? It shared many qualities with Lazarin\u2019s work \u2014 quiet, literary, realist \u2014 but it made a particular generation of women feel as if they were about to crawl out of their skin, as if they suddenly remembered how bad things had been, how bad they could be, how bad they could get.\n\nIn \u201cAmerican Men in Paris I Did Not Love,\u201d Lazarin\u2019s narrator finds herself in the presence of an insufferable pedant who is probably married and certainly has designs on her. \u201cWe spend four hours together,\u201d she notes flatly, \u201cbefore I remember that I can just get up and go.\u201d And so these stories hand their warnings to us: Don\u2019t be pleasant or easy to teach.

These included \u201cInside Amy Schumer\u201d (which won the accommodating Schumer an Emmy for best variety sketch show); \u201cTransparent\u201d (which won its creator, Jill Soloway, an Emmy for directing); and the Golden Globe comedy nominees \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d (created by Jenji Kohan), \u201cGirls\u201d (the signature work of Lena Dunham) and \u201cJane the Virgin\u201d (developed by Jennie Snyder Urman). Meanwhile, the powerhouse producer Shonda Rhimes dominated network television on Thursday nights with \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy,\u201d \u201cScandal\u201d and \u201cHow to Get Away With Murder\u201d (created by \u201cGrey\u2019s\u201d supervising producer Peter Nowalk).\n\nPhoto\n\nNot unrealistically, the happy publication tie-in that Press expected and hoped for as her work got underway was the election of Hillary Clinton to become the first female president of the United States; the Democratic candidate\u2019s triumph would be the history-making climax of a campaign supported by many of the same industry women Press was interviewing. Dunham, for one, stumped indefatigably on Clinton\u2019s behalf. Rhimes and her producing partner, Betsy Beers, made the video that introduced Clinton at the 2016 Democratic convention. Diane English, who dreamed up the conversation-setting feminist sitcom \u201cMurphy Brown\u201d in the Reaganite 1980s, backed a pro-Clinton super PAC.\n\nWe know the Big Reveal. By the time the author, a former TV critic for The Village Voice, finished her book, Donald Trump had become the first fake-reality-TV character to occupy the Oval Office. \u201cWhat looked like the forward march of progress turned out to be one of history\u2019s grand zigzags,\u201d Press says in her realistically dismayed introduction. And so began the rising up of a new, very real, very raw female impatience with the same-old, same-old ways of gender inequality in politics; and in the workplace; and in the arts, media, industrial life, military life, factory life, corporate life and even in cartoon-superhero life, what with lady heroes condemned to run around in constricting bustiers.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe rising up continues. Nothing on the air seems quite so funny or delightful anymore, and the scripted shows meant to shock, provoke and amuse, whether about trans sexuality within the family (\u201cTransparent\u201d), murder as oh-hello (\u201cScandal\u201d) or weird sex stuff that women are jolly about (\u201cBroad City,\u201d made by Abbi Jacobson and Ilana Glazer), don\u2019t cause nearly as much shock as the testimony of real women talking about what they experience during working hours.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe litany of imbalances sounds repetitious only because gender inequality repeats itself daily, while the latest headline-making abuses are discussed as if fantastic plot twists in an outrageous soap. And so, between the long-ago year of 2015 and now, the agitation continues, hashtags flying, with ramifications for pop culture and the business behind it that go considerably beyond the scope of Press\u2019s investigation.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn other words, \u201cStealing the Show\u201d at times feels a little bereft of urgency.\n\nThen again. Here is a collection of women who have managed to make television on their own terms, embodying proof that it can be done. Press gives a properly respectful nod to Gertrude Berg, who wrote, starred in and produced \u201cThe Goldbergs\u201d from 1949 to 1955, calling her \u201cthe founding mother of the American TV sitcom.\u201d She makes quick, appropriate bows to \u201cI Love Lucy\u201d (and Lucille Ball), \u201cThat Girl\u201d (and Marlo Thomas) and \u201cThe Mary Tyler Moore Show\u201d (and its namesake). She learns from Barbara Corday, who, with her writing partner Barbara Avedon, launched the breakout female-cop-buddy drama \u201cCagney & Lacey\u201d in 1982, that the seed of the show\u2019s idea was inspired, in a roundabout way, by the feminist critic Molly Haskell\u2019s essential critique \u201cFrom Reverence to Rape: The Treatment of Women in the Movies.\u201d", "keywords": ["televised", "writing", "tv", "life", "work", "stealing", "won", "women", "press", "television", "revolution", "female"], "polarity": 0.18218982275586054, "subjectivity": 0.45402372784448247},

Curtis wears the hems of his jeans flamboyantly long so his loafers flatten them as he walks, a hallmark of slouchy, preppie indifference. And as the mothers watch another mother hugging and kissing her daughter after school, \u201ceach one of us remembered, in a depth of bumming-out, the moment, in preadolescence, when we had learned from either our parents or our peers that one had to pretend not to care.\u201d Even the marriages are chilly: \u201cA certain type of man needed a wife to help keep things impersonal, as if marriage were a barracks, and inspection from the outside could come at any time.\u201d Brrrr.\n\nMacy is well versed in the rigors of schadenfreude and social judgment. The descendant of an old-money family that had lost its fortune by her father\u2019s generation, she attended an East Coast boarding school, then went to Yale on scholarship. As she revealed in 2009 on the publication of her previous book, \u201cSpoiled,\u201d a story collection about class distinctions among the privileged, her husband had lost jobs at a bank and a hedge fund, and her older daughter had been rejected by all the private schools they applied to for kindergarten.

Within this novel, there\u2019s almost an entire treatise on the decorating habits of the wealthy \u2014 and not so wealthy. One mother can\u2019t be trusted to weigh in on another\u2019s apartment because her own home is \u201cfloor to ceiling Pottery Barn \u2014 giant clocks, lobster traps for coffee tables, apothecary shop for a kitchen.\u201d Minnie\u2019s kitchen is \u201cvast, suburban-size,\u201d glistening \u201clike an operating theater with menacing, hyper-clean appliances.\u201d One townhouse is so grand that its parlor floor makes the gathered parents look dumpy, \u201cas if the room had been made for a larger, more significant race, one that didn\u2019t have to stuff itself into pantyhose or pay through the nose for monthly highlights in a condescending salon on Madison.\u201d Even among wealthy people, there are levels of fabulousness.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In fact, the stories are similar: Both use the children\u2019s school as a stage, with the parents as the stars. \u201cMrs.\u201d is set among the Manhattan 1-percenters who count wine cellars and his-and-hers drivers as necessities, just as the TV version of \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d is set among the wealthy of Monterey. And as both stories unfold, the pursuit of luxurious lifestyles becomes incidental to survival, revenge and redemption.\n\nConsider a scene from \u201cMrs.\u201d that might as well have been directed by Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e. Two mothers confront John D. Curtis and engage him in combat, eventually wresting from his wife an overdue debt. One takes off with her compensation (from an assignation-turned-assault during her \u201cBelle du Jour\u201d days), and as she strides away with her children, crisp hundred-dollar bills sail out of her pockets.\n\nThe remaining parents regard one another in stunned silence. Do they chase the money? Of course! Even masters of the capitalist universe and their flawless wives are soon scampering after the floating bills, stooping to the sidewalk, \u201cone with a stomp of the foot, the other on his knees, shooting out a hand.\u201d It\u2019s the children who look on, aghast.\n\nThe boldest thing about \u201cMrs.\u201d \u2014 as with \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d \u2014 is that it focuses on the depths of women\u2019s experiences as wives and mothers. Their clashes with one another are entertaining, sure, but they\u2019re a diversion from the more important conflict with their husbands and with male power. \u201cMrs.\u201d could easily have been a glossy, rushed novel about bitchy, bored housewives nursing social resentment. Plenty of those have been published, passing from memory as quickly as the pages fly under your fingers. But Macy hasn\u2019t written that kind of book. Although Philippa, Minnie and Gwen aren\u2019t smash-the-patriarchy crusaders for social justice, they recognize the violent, self-flattering, corrupt man in their midst and they deliver him, finally, to justice \u2014 even if it comes at the expense of other lives.", "keywords": ["social", "wealthy", "parents", "macy", "lies", "upper", "school", "turf", "wars", "novel", "mothers", "style", "ultrawealthy", "east", "mrs", "little"], "polarity": 0.08597234576686631, "subjectivity": 0.5817487991460596},

(\u201cYes,\u201d he replied. \u201cBut only because you already told me that last week.\u201d)\n\nPhoto\n\nIn these books, the women who shaped the American narrative come to life with refreshing attention to detail. \u201cVotes for Women\u201d opens with a minibiography of Elizabeth Cady Stanton, set up as a cinematic hero\u2019s journey from that fateful moment when her father, mourning the death of his last son, told his daughter he wished she had been born a boy. Zimet is less wide-eyed and more unsentimental in her approach. Opting for frankness about the racism of Stanton\u2019s platform, for instance, she contextualizes but also condemns her use of the atrocious term \u201cSambo.\u201d\n\nOf course, no women were more oppressed than women of color, and their stories are buried even deeper than those of the few celebrity suffragists who make it into stock history lessons. \u201cRoses and Radicals\u201d and \u201cVotes for Women\u201d both remind us of this fact through the inclusion of Sojourner Truth\u2019s 1851 \u201cAin\u2019t I a Woman\u201d speech at a women\u2019s rights meeting in Akron, Ohio. \u201cTruth was demanding that her listeners understand that women\u2019s rights weren\u2019t merely a matter for white women,\u201d Zimet writes. There are listeners today who still need help understanding this. Imagine if the most fundamental realities of women\u2019s intersecting identities were taken into consideration in history class.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne woman of color in particular is at the center of Amy Hill Hearth\u2019s STREETCAR TO JUSTICE: How Elizabeth Jennings Won the Right to Ride in New York (HarperCollins, 160 pp., $19.99; ages 8 to 12). In 1854, a century before Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on a Montgomery bus, there was Jennings\u2019s defiant bravery on a streetcar in the Five Points neighborhood of New York. Wrapped up in Hearth\u2019s detailing of Jennings\u2019s courage is a sobering recognition that the shame of our nation\u2019s history was widespread. Slavery wasn\u2019t restricted to the South. In fact, New York City itself was home to a municipal slave market until 1762. Writing with a compassionate hand-holding tone perhaps best suited for readers on the younger end of the book\u2019s suggested age range, Hearth reminds us that Jennings was not only blocked from riding in a streetcar, she also faced institutionalized obstacles. \u201cFor blacks, both boys and girls, the road to success was blocked by the color of their skin,\u201d she explains. \u201cOnly a very few managed to break through the barriers, and when they did, they still were not considered equal to whites.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThings hadn\u2019t improved much nearly 100 years later, during the time that Melba Pattillo Beals writes about in her shocking autobiography, MARCH FORWARD, GIRL: From Young Warrior to Little Rock Nine (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 224 pp., $16.99; ages 10 and up). This book looks at Beals\u2019s younger years, before she was part of the Little Rock Nine who integrated Central High School (as she recounts in her best-selling \u201cWarriors Don\u2019t Cry\u201d). In empathetic yet unflinching prose respectful of younger readers, Beals depicts the nightmarish way the KKK held sway over the lives of black people. \u201cThe first thing I remember about being a person living in Little Rock, Ark., during the 1940s is the gut-wrenching fear in my heart and tummy that I was in danger,\u201d she begins. \u201cBy age 3, I realized the culture of this small town in the Deep South was such that the color of my skin framed the entire scope of my life.\u201d Beals candidly details the origins of her activism, as her fear transforms into rage over the passivity of the tormented adults who felt they could do nothing. There is in this new book even more untold history, more pain, outright terror and forgotten bravery, and yet so little has changed.\n\nIt\u2019s thrilling to think of girls and young women immersed in not just history-book bullet points, but entire chapters fleshing out the stories of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Elizabeth Jennings. Previously, a curious child might have found these depictions in the pages of a dusty encyclopedia, and only if she knew where to look. We have been denied the full reality of our past, both its injustices and its secret heroes. It is still true that the road to success is blocked by both skin color and gender.\n\nEach victory in these pages is hung with the spoiler alert that we have yet to pass the Equal Rights Amendment. These books are an assertion of the female narrative, containing anger about the past, while arming a new generation with information they need to create a hopeful future.

In \u201cJane Eyre,\u201d she wrote from the first-person perspective of a child, an innovation that gave voice and power even to the very young; she created, too, a heroine who was, like Bront\u00eb herself, plain, pale, small, and yet frankly desirous, as well as worthy of desire.\n\nBront\u00eb once wrote to a friend that she considered the marital ambitions of women of no means or beauty \u201can imbecility which I reject with contempt,\u201d a practical response to the frank injustices of class and a kind of sexism. In her novels, however, those same plain women are entitled to not just any marriages, but to passionate, loving ones. The interior lives of Jane Eyre and Lucy Snowe are shared in such detail that the characters\u2019 unfair burdens are plainly manifest; Bront\u00eb could make great sweeping plotlines of the small moments and humiliations in an unmarried woman\u2019s life. Lucy Snowe\u2019s struggle to find a private place to read a long-awaited letter reads, over several pages, with the suspense and drama of a Spenserian quest.\n\nA miniaturist of the soul, Bront\u00eb captured shades of emotion with a psychological subtlety that still feels exquisitely modern. When Lucy Snowe, battling depression, is advised to cultivate her own happiness, her strong response will feel familiar to many a 21st-century person who has the condition: \u201cNo mockery in this world ever sounds to me so hollow as that of being told to cultivate happiness,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHappiness is not a potato to be planted in mould and tilled with manure.\u201d\n\nShe had a mordant wit, which could protect her only so much from the series of losses that left her so fragile. \u201cIt is useless to tell you how I live,\u201d she wrote to a friend in 1851. \u201cI endure life \u2014 but whether I enjoy it or not is another question.\u201d She startled readily, and wrote to friends complaining of crushing insomnia, a poor appetite, grief and flashbacks; she put off writing letters for fear of how dejected she would feel if the replies came too slowly. Her two most intense romantic passions \u2014 one, involving a married Belgian school master, was meticulously memorialized in \u201cVillette\u201d; the other, for her publisher, George Smith (also captured in the characteristics of a doctor in \u201cVillette\u201d) \u2014 were both unrequited.\n\nBut reader, she married, eventually, at the age of 38, choosing Arthur Bell Nicholls, a pastor who worked for Bront\u00eb\u2019s father. Although she acknowledged frankly that he was not her intellectual equal, he pursued her persistently, and against her father\u2019s wishes, possibly imbuing a late-in-life courtship with a jolt of romance.\n\nDid Bront\u00eb ultimately find the kind of happiness that she described as \u201ca glory shining far down upon us out of heaven\u201d? In \u201cVillette,\u201d Lucy Snowe describes her own feelings about happiness: \u201cThe negation of severe suffering was the nearest approach to happiness I expected to know. Besides, I seemed to hold two lives \u2014 the life of thought, and that of reality. And provided the former was nourished with a sufficiency of strange and necromantic joys of fancy, the privileges of the latter might remain limited to daily bread, hourly work and a roof of shelter.\u201d Once Bront\u00eb married, however, her life of thought suffered. \u201cMy own life is more occupied than it used to be,\u201d she wrote to a friend. \u201cI have not so much time for thinking.\u201d\n\nLiterature would no longer be the business of her life; whether the pleasures of marriage could offset that loss remains unclear. To one friend, she wrote, \u201cIt is a solemn and strange and perilous thing for a woman to become a wife.\u201d But several months later, she wrote, \u201cI have a good, kind attached husband, and every day makes my own attachment to him stronger.\u201d", "keywords": ["lucy", "novelist", "wrote", "married", "snowe", "known", "eyre", "bront\u00eb", "jane", "life", "friend", "women", "villette", "overlooked", "happiness", "charlotte"], "polarity": 0.15464722412090828, "subjectivity": 0.4587040517961569},

In \u201cThe Unspeakable,\u201d Meghan Daum chips away at convention to uncover unvarnished personal truths.

Koul puts on a breezy and fleetingly filthy sideshow, but when she writes about gender and race she reveals that knife-throwing is her main act.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The book takes digressive turns (long walks and talks about art abound) and structural liberties (some of the dialogue among Sheila and her friends, including her painter confidante, Margaux, appears in the form of a play) on the road to both self-discovery and the realization of \u201cthe true singularity\u201d of others.\n\nThe roads Chew-Bose follows in her slim collection of 14 visually and verbally astute essays lead inward. She narrates her discursive thoughts in a breathless torrent of thrillingly precise observations about everyday life (\u201cthe rubbery satisfaction of yanking a single blade of grass from its root\u201d) and minute reflections on cultural figures and their work, from the playwright Annie Baker to the Beastie Boys to Janet Jackson. The glow emanating from Chew-Bose\u2019s voracious curiosity and engagement with art and emotion illuminates not only her particularly searching mind at work, but also a new way of seeing the world.\n\nIn her books \u201cDon\u2019t Let Me Be Lonely,\u201d a vital collage of words and images from life and politics and television and death, and \u201cCitizen,\u201d a meditative and arresting distillation of racism in America, Claudia Rankine mixes the personal and the political.

She has spoken often about the pleasure she takes in fashion, and she is the face of Boots No7, a makeup brand.\n\nMs. Adichie has cultivated these two strands of her identity: the serious literary author and the fashion icon. In turn, she has been celebrated both by mainstream pop culture and the literati. She won a MacArthur fellowship in 2008, and her novel \u201cAmericanah\u201d won the 2013 National Book Critics Circle Award for fiction and was chosen as New York City\u2019s \u201cOne Book\u201d for 2017. Her 2012 TEDx talk, \u201cWe Should All Be Feminists,\u201d was sampled by Beyonc\u00e9 in her music, and excerpts appeared on T-shirts at Dior\u2019s Paris Fashion Week show last year. The pop and the literary threads are not opposites to her, and their merger is central to the way she presents her public self and her work.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s very important that brilliant women step up and be hot babes,\u201d Ms. Adichie joked in a conversation with the author Zadie Smith in 2014.\n\nPhoto\n\nSo in the past few years, she has become something of a star, flourishing at the unlikely juncture of fiction writing and celebrity. Her position was on full display during her visit to New York, where she started her book tour last week. She took the stage in front of a sold-out crowd at Cooper Union, and there was \u201cthis kind of unanimous scream,\u201d said Robin Desser, a Knopf editor who has worked with Ms. Adichie for 12 years.\n\n\u201cI really have never seen anything like this,\u201d Ms. Desser said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve published people who are really popular.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe main proposition of \u201cDear Ijeawele\u201d is that feminism is a project that necessarily binds mothers and daughters, and that raising a daughter feminist has as much to do with what you tell yourself as what you tell her. Ms. Adichie\u2019s first of 15 suggestions places a mother\u2019s freedom and growth at the center of a daughter\u2019s feminist education.\n\n\u201cBe a full person,\u201d Ms. Adichie writes. \u201cMotherhood is a glorious gift, but do not define yourself solely by motherhood.\u201d\n\nThe book grew partly out of the desire of Ms. Adichie\u2019s friend, called Ijeawele in the text, to teach her daughter \u201cto take less of the nonsense\u201d that past generations faced. Ms. Adichie wrote her friend a letter in 2015 and published it on Facebook last year.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The responses she received made her even more sure that it was an important piece to write.\n\n\u201cEven friends of mine \u2014 people I love \u2014 wrote, \u2018why yes, we kind of agree, but why call it feminist? It\u2019s just common sense.\u2019 And I\u2019m like no, it\u2019s feminist,\u201d Ms. Adichie said. \u201cOr, oh it\u2019s just humanism. Or someone said, \u2018these are just democratic ideals.\u2019 And I thought, what? It\u2019s everything but to acknowledge the fact that gender is a problem.\u201d\n\nMs. Adichie wrote the letter before she was a parent, but now she has a 17-month-old daughter whom she is trying to raise as a feminist. She and her husband split their time between Nigeria, where she grew up, and the United States.\n\nMs. Adichie often comments on how race and gender play out in the United States, but her book does not tackle some of the meatier questions that have occupied the American feminist movement in recent years, most notably the role of transgender people.\n\nOn this book tour, after we spoke, Ms. Adichie made controversial comments suggesting that transgender women experience male privilege before they transition. For activists who have been grappling with these questions for years, the comments came across as ill-informed. Asked about them, Ms. Adichie suggested through a spokesman that people go to her Facebook page, where she has posted several responses, acknowledging that her comments \u201cupset many people, and I consider their concerns to be valid.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see how my saying that we should not conflate the gender experiences of trans women with that of women born female could appear as if I was suggesting that one experience is more important than the other. Or that the experiences of trans women are less valid than those of women born female,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI do not think so at all \u2014 I know that trans women can be vulnerable in ways that women born female are not.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Adichie has written about Hillary Clinton for The Atlantic and Michelle Obama in T: The New York Times Style Magazine, and last summer wrote a short story in The Times imagining Melania Trump\u2019s experience on the campaign trail. Although she was an enthusiastic Hillary Clinton supporter in the election, she sees Mrs. Trump as a sympathetic character.\n\n\u201cI think there is some misogyny in the way she\u2019s been characterized, and I think it\u2019s ugly,\u201d Ms. Adichie said. She becomes animated talking about the vitriol aimed at Mrs. Trump, in the same way she bristles when asked about how Mrs. Clinton was treated during the campaign. She is concerned with how society responds to powerful women across the political spectrum.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even like talking about it, because I get very upset,\u201d she said while describing the media\u2019s focus on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s \u201clikability.\u201d (One of the suggestions in her book is for mothers to teach daughters to \u201creject likability.\u201d)\n\nMs. Adichie will not say what she\u2019s working on next \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m very superstitious\u201d \u2014 but continues to write and throw herself into her international speaking engagements. The satisfaction she takes in her work is at the heart of her proposal: To raise feminist daughters, mothers must take pleasure in their own achievements, follow both the challenges and delights of the work, and give themselves room to fail.

In 1983, Paule Marshall, best known for her novel \u201cBrown Girl, Brownstones,\u201d reflected on how observing her mother\u2019s relationship to language inspired her career. An excerpt follows.\n\nI grew up among poets. Now they didn\u2019t look like poets \u2014 whatever that breed is supposed to look like. Nothing about them suggested that poetry was their calling. They were just a group of ordinary housewives and mothers, my mother included, who dressed in a way (shapeless housedresses, dowdy felt hats and long, dark, solemn coats) that made it impossible for me to imagine they had ever been young.\n\nNor did they do what poets were supposed to do \u2014 spend their days in an attic room writing verses. Several mornings a week these unknown bards would put an apron and a pair of old house shoes in a shopping bag and take the train or streetcar from our section of Brooklyn out to Flatbush. There, those who didn\u2019t have steady jobs would wait on certain designated corners for the white housewives in the neighborhood to come along and bargain with them over pay for a day\u2019s work cleaning their houses. Later, armed with the few dollars they had earned, which in their vocabulary became \u201ca few raw-mouth pennies,\u201d they made their way back to our neighborhood, where they would sometimes stop off to have a cup of tea or cocoa together before going home to cook dinner for their husbands and children.\n\nThere was no way for me to understand it at the time, but the talk that filled the kitchen those afternoons was highly functional. It served as therapy, the cheapest kind available to my mother and her friends. It restored them to a sense of themselves and reaffirmed their self-worth. Through language they were able to overcome the humiliations of the work day. Confronted by a world they could not encompass, they took refuge in language.\n\nThey taught me my first lessons in the narrative art. They trained my ear. They set a standard of excellence. This is why the best of my work must be attributed to them; it stands as testimony to the rich legacy of language and culture they so freely passed on to me in the wordshop of the kitchen.", "keywords": ["mother", "book", "supposed", "look", "work", "way", "neighborhood", "poets", "language", "mothers", "notes", "review", "archives", "ordinary"], "polarity": 0.106871921182266, "subjectivity": 0.42137110016420365},

What books made you fall in love with poetry?\n\nI had a big reading textbook in fifth grade, which I\u2019d race ahead in and find \u2014 to my great excitement \u2014 brief poems by poets like Emily Dickinson and Gwendolyn Brooks. When I was growing up, my father had a series of books whose titles began \u201cThe Works of \u2026.\u201d Without making a lot of fuss about them, or worrying over the literal sense of them, I read sonnets by Shakespeare and poems by Poe, and loved the feeling that those works created in me. I felt from an early age that poetry was something mysterious, something playful and lilting. As I got older, poems began to offer me new and life-changing ways of looking at the familiar world.\n\nWas there a book of poems or a poet in particular that inspired you to write?\n\nSeamus Heaney\u2019s first book, \u201cDeath of a Naturalist,\u201d made me want to be a poet. More than that, it made me want to be Seamus Heaney, and I imitated him for a long time. I was his student as an undergraduate, and that whole time I was, at least in my heart, imitating him. He was kind and generous enough to guide me gently toward what he recognized as intimations of my own voice and subject matter.\n\nWhich poets continue to inspire you?\n\nLucille Clifton and Elizabeth Bishop are never-ending sources of anchoring and astonishment for me as a poet. The more I read them, the more their poems seem to accomplish. I\u2019m co-translating the contemporary Chinese poet Yi Lei, and her vision of freedom and love, her concerns for humanity and for the planet speak very actively to my own. I\u2019m learning a great deal from living with her voice and her imagination.\n\nAre there poets for whom you\u2019ve gained greater appreciation over time?\n\nWhen I first became brave enough to tell people that I wrote poems, so many people would rave to me about Edna St. Vincent Millay\u2019s work. I was embarrassed not to have read her and I think that put me off from reading her for a long time. So many of her poems are just impeccable. I love the subtlety and the tiny, yet significant, gestures driving poems like \u201cEbb\u201d and \u201cThe Fitting.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

What books do you recommend to them? And have they in turn pointed you to any neglected or unfamiliar writers?\n\nI find myself sharing poems by other poets on these trips, which is something I didn\u2019t used to do at readings. Some of the voices I\u2019ve been excited to celebrate so far are Natalie Diaz, Aracelis Girmay, John Yau, Patrick Rosal, Laura Kasischke and Chen Chen. I like that these are poets living and writing in America today, each with different thematic concerns, different approaches to language and different ideas about what it means to belong to this place made up of many places. And I feel very lucky that I get to meet other poets in my travels. In New Mexico, I met dg okpik, an Inupiaq-Inuit poet whose work draws Inuit creation stories into conversation with a personal exploration of self, family and the natural world. And I read recently with Kealoha, the poet laureate of Hawaii, whose performance piece \u201cThe Story of Everything\u201d traces the origin of the universe from the Big Bang until now.\n\nIf you had to name one book that made you who you are today, what would it be?\n\n\u201cLittle Women\u201d made me into a reader. About a decade later, I wrote one of my college admissions essays on Thoreau\u2019s \u201cWalden.\u201d I have no memory of what I might have said then about the book, though I do remember loving its various paradoxes and the beautiful spacious sense of self, nature and possibility that the prose fostered. I was longing for the kind of largeness of spirit and rhetorical authority of a writer like Thoreau. I didn\u2019t encounter Emerson until college, but I think I was an aspiring Transcendentalist from a young age.\n\nWhat genres do you especially enjoy reading? And which do you avoid?\n\nI have three kids, so children\u2019s literature is a big part of my life. At one time, I thought I\u2019d raise my kids on the classic books from my childhood: \u201cLittle House in the Big Woods,\u201d Beverly Cleary\u2019s wonderful Ramona books, \u201cBlack Beauty.\u201d It\u2019s been great to revisit some of those titles as a parent, but my children have guided me to the joys of contemporary children\u2019s literature. Jacqueline Woodson\u2019s books are such a gift to parents and children for their poignant subtlety and lyricism, and their willingness to let a reader dwell in the pangs of realization that we sometimes try to protect our children from. I\u2019m thinking of \u201cEach Kindness\u201d and \u201cThe Other Side.\u201d My daughter is 8 and loves the way that private and public history intersect in \u201cFeathers.\u201d Many picture books have fostered inroads for talking with our kids about history: Margaret H. Mason\u2019s \u201cThese Hands\u201d tells the story of racial discrimination at the Wonder Bread factory in the 1950s and \u201960s. Selina Alko\u2019s \u201cThe Case for Loving\u201d tells the story behind the Supreme Court\u2019s Loving v. Virginia decision. And then there are books that have given us a wonderfully useful vocabulary for feelings of anger or longing, like Barbara O\u2019Connor\u2019s \u201cWish.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nI have to say that I just haven\u2019t found a way to get excited about \u201cHarry Potter,\u201d though my daughter and husband loved the series. I loved C. S. Lewis as a kid, so I thought I\u2019d have a toehold in that world, but invariably I\u2019d get about two paragraphs in and fall asleep. Maybe I\u2019ll be ready to face those books in a few more years when they come around for our boys.\n\nWhat books might we be surprised to find on your shelves?\n\nPerhaps because I\u2019ve lost both my parents, I really appreciate Elisabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross\u2019s books on death and dying.\n\nWhat do you plan to read next?\n\nEmily Wilson\u2019s translation of \u201cThe Odyssey.\u201d", "keywords": ["book", "big", "k", "poets", "poems", "books", "id", "read", "loving", "poet", "smith", "tracy", "reading"], "polarity": 0.23049761686125333, "subjectivity": 0.4975381520836067},

Le Guin\n\n215 pp. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. $22.\n\nPhoto\n\nLe Guin (who died in January) has written before about the genre for which she is best known, and explains herein that \u201cthe fantastic tale may suspend the laws of physics \u2026 but it carries its revolt against reality no further.\u201d That is, the author of fantasy must have a sharp understanding of emotional, social and political realities. Such intelligence gleams in these essays, culled from several years of blog posts. Le Guin claims the form \u201csounds like a sodden tree trunk in a bog\u201d and calls her own attempts \u201cmore trivially personal\u201d than those that inspired her. But the trivially personal is a chief pleasure of this collection, which uses its firm footing in the concrete world to ponder an eclectic array of topics. The pages sparkle with lines that make a reader glance up, searching for an available ear with which to share them.\n\n\u201cOld age is for anybody who gets there,\u201d Le Guin asserts in a scorching section about aging, while two others describe the travails of her cat, Pard, with less irony than J. R. Ackerley\u2019s memoir of his dog, Tulip, but no less charm. Other sections meander from the nature of belief, Homer and the obsolete nature of the Great American Novel to domestic studies like the relocation of a rattlesnake from her own yard to that of the millionaire down the street.\n\nThe strongest essays narrow themselves to Le Guin\u2019s fervent obsession with language. In \u201cHaving My Cake,\u201d a contemplation of her difficulty understanding proverbs becomes a syntax-shuffling close reading of the one in the title. This linguistic gnawing is one of the book\u2019s great delights. \u201cWords fascinate me,\u201d she explains, \u201cthe way box elder beetles fascinate my friend Pard,\u201d who will \u201cstare unmoving for 10 minutes at the unattainable light fixture in which a beetle is visible as a tiny moving silhouette.\u201d Images as simple and striking as this or the \u201csmall but violent\u201d LED lights on a Christmas tree become grand observations on the nature of writing and living. \u201cWords are my skein of yarn, my lump of wet clay, my block of uncarved wood,\u201d she explains, and then quietly astounds us with the carving.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nI WROTE THIS BECAUSE I LOVE YOU\n\nEssays\n\nBy Tim Kreider\n\n206 pp. Simon & Schuster. $26.\n\nPhoto\n\nKreider, a political cartoonist and essayist, has indeed written this book because he loves you. Or rather, because he has loved some women and one cat, and learned a few things along the way. In a style reminiscent of Orwell, E. B. White and David Sedaris, an affable hero gamely bumbles through adventures rich with moments of fleeting profundity and moral reckoning. He follows a manic circus tutor on a train to Mexico, falls for a fellow cartoonist amid the early aughts\u2019 war on terror and trysts with a politically enlightened prostitute. These stories entertain, though I prefer him being wittily deprecated by his female companions to his drawing binaries between \u201c\u2018Type A\u2019: smart, pretty, sane, moral girls with glasses who tended to work for nonprofits or write\u201d and \u201cbawdy dominatrices\u201d (to be fair, this reviewer is a Type A, former bawdy dominatrix who writes). But his depictions of the arc from ignorance to wisdom are reliably deft.

Describing the emotional rush of an evening spent colluding and conjoining, she sounds as if she has a new crush: \u201cI related to every single thing she said,\u201d Schaefer tells us, reporting that they discussed \u201cthings I don\u2019t typically share with someone I\u2019m just sitting down with for the first time.\u201d She gushes to her mother via text the next day: \u201cI have a new best friend. \u2026 I love her.\u201d\n\nIn a year that has been described as a women\u2019s renaissance, female friendship feels particularly worthy of contemplation. As professional opportunities broaden and cultural attitudes shift, competition between women has given way to allyship. Through the return of women\u2019s social organizations and the formalization of whisper networks, female solidarity is more pervasive than ever, a byproduct of girl power and the cumulation of years of quiet rebellion.\n\n\u201cWomen are stepping up together, loudly and publicly,\u201d writes Schaefer, a journalist whose subjects have ranged from the Korean beauty industry to the occult. It seems the world is finally recognizing the power of female connection, which the poet Adrienne Rich once described as \u201cthe most feared, the most problematic and the most potentially transforming force on the planet.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhat girl hasn\u2019t buzzed with the rare thrill of a new friendship? It offers a shared hiding place and a secret understanding outside the reach of men, parents, employers; someone who hates everything you hate, who takes on your causes as her own; someone who, after leaving you at the end of the night, cares that you get home safely.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn many of our lives, friendships matter as much as romantic relationships. Friends are our soul mates \u2014 and, more practically, our emergency contacts. Why then, Schaefer asks, is friendship as an institution not afforded the same benefits and privileges as marriage? It\u2019s a position that has been gaining steam in the legal community, among advocates of so-called friendship law like Rachel Moran, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has argued that platonic bonds ought to matter \u201cnot only in my own intimate life, but in the eyes of the law.\u201d", "keywords": ["action", "potential", "womens", "schaefer", "girl", "text", "matter", "friendship", "romantic", "law", "female", "power", "squads"], "polarity": 0.14661102786102786, "subjectivity": 0.47259892884892873},

Alizadeh raps, \u201cLet me scream, I\u2019m tired of silence,\u201d while lifting a Western-style wedding veil. Beneath it her face is made up to look as if she\u2019s been beaten: swollen eyes and bruised jaw. It\u2019s a powerful image, one that Bagieu doesn\u2019t hesitate to draw into the strip.\n\nVideo\n\nAnd Bagieu\u2019s drawings are wonderful. Though sometimes spare, with minimal effort spent on backgrounds, her line manages to flow and skate through 29 stories of remarkable women. These drawings can act. They are alive with gestural attitude. They move, dance, struggle, fight back, fall in love, resist and wonder at the world. Some ham it up. Some suffer terrible abuse. To her credit, Bagieu doesn\u2019t back away from drawing the marks of violence on their faces and their bodies, which may come as a surprise to those who are expecting a rah-rah young adult girl-power sort of read.\n\nBagieu calls these comics \u201cbroad stroke portraits,\u201d and explains the sometimes too breezy storytelling this way: \u201cThis book is by no means a thorough scholarly work; rather, it\u2019s one woman\u2019s tribute \u2014 my homage to the full, daring lives they lead, often against great odds.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAll of her stories follow a similar pattern. Almost every page has nine frames and each biography begins with a portrait drawn in a beribboned oval template. They cover the birth, life and death of each of her subjects in a way that can feel a bit formulaic, but this seems to have more to do with the fact that the English translation is typeset rather than in Bagieu\u2019s handwriting.\n\nIn the original version of these strips, which are luckily available in French on the Le Monde website, where they originally appeared, the difference is instantly apparent. The nature of handwriting gives the portraits a more personal \u201cvoice.\u201d It feels as if Bagieu herself is telling you these stories. They lose their Wikipedia tone and become more intimate, more like that of a cool fairy godmother recounting tales you need to hear without too much worry about sources, originality or historical accuracy. Her handwriting preserves her passion, along with clear intent to both delight and embolden the reader.\n\nPhoto\n\nIt\u2019s painful to see this crucial part of her work replaced with type. It changes everything about how the stories are received. The reading speed is altered. The tone and the visual relationship between the text and the drawing just isn\u2019t there. It\u2019s her handwriting that makes these panels spring to life. Panels that seemed awkwardly composed suddenly become elegant and beautifully balanced. It\u2019s hard for people to understand the importance of a cartoonist\u2019s handwriting. In the same way melody transforms lyrics, handwriting transforms words and can have a profound impact on how the story is received and understood.\n\nSadly, nearly every scrap of Bagieu\u2019s lovely handwriting has been scrubbed and replaced in this translation, even when completely unnecessary. The only clue to this \u201cvoice\u201d is a rare lettered sign here and there, and her name, \u201cP\u00e9n\u00e9lope,\u201d sweetly signed at the end of each strip.\n\nThese \u201crebel ladies\u201d come from all over the world (though surprisingly over a third of them are American). They also come from all points in time, like Agnodice, whom Bagieu presents as a gutsy gynecologist from ancient Greece, to the astronaut Mae Jemison (the one with the tight Afro), to the \u201cAnimal Whisperer\u201d Temple Grandin and the \u201cLover of Modern Art\u201d Peggy Guggenheim (she\u2019s the one with the wild sunglasses). Bagieu includes sets of siblings, like the Wiggins sisters, who were forced by their father to form a rock band called \u201cThe Shaggs,\u201d and \u201cLas Mariposas,\u201d the Dominican Republic\u2019s Mirabel sisters, who were murdered during the Trujillo regime in 1960. And she profiles too one of my favorite women, Frances Glessner Lee, who helped crime scene investigators hone their craft by creating intensely accurate miniature replicas of rooms where murders took place.\n\nBagieu has dedicated this book to her own daughters, and I kept that in mind as I read it. When I imagine her telling these stories to them, I\u2019m reminded of something my grandmother would say when she told me these kinds of tales. \u201cOf course it is only a story my dear. But it is true!\u201d Bagieu\u2019s pen transforms these true stories into something that has the tone of a personalized fairy tale.

Some of Lazarin\u2019s stories \u2014 not coincidentally, my favorites \u2014 show women pinging furiously off one another instead of their boyfriends, husbands and fathers, gathering incremental surges of strength and autonomy and rage, of unspoken power. In \u201cThe Holographic Soul,\u201d two young sisters playact a psychic guessing game, then try to actually access their powers, longing for a presence to manifest itself and give them something solid on which to pin their anxieties. The two teenage friends in \u201cGone\u201d keep a list of real-life dead girls, sharing their fear as puberty descends. (\u201cGirls are taught to be discreet,\u201d Lazarin writes in a later story. \u201cBoys, who shout their own terror, make a mess of it, take you down with them.\u201d)\n\nPhoto\n\nIt\u2019s easy to anticipate criticism of \u201cBack Talk\u201d and its quietly realist, \u201cliterary\u201d writing. It won\u2019t help to note that Lazarin\u2019s characters are educated and middle- to upper-class, that her stories are often set in New York and Paris. They are, certainly, beautifully crafted. I loathe the word \u201cpolished\u201d in the context of prose. It\u2019s too clinical, implying that the work was dull before the author intentionally spruced it up. So I\u2019d prefer to say that the sentences in these stories are living and seamless, as if Lazarin had run her hand over them until they became smooth and gleaming with the evidence of her touch. Yet they are not without viscera; sublimated rage fills the crevices between them.\n\nLazarin\u2019s style succeeds in part because the stakes for her characters are wide-ranging, because the implications of their actions ripple outward. In \u201cBack Talk,\u201d the theme of internalized misogyny is, to be quite blunt, terrifying. It\u2019s all the scarier in that it\u2019s so quietly and accurately rendered: These women aren\u2019t running screaming through the night, fleeing to convents, joining all-female cults or driving off into the desert without looking back.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn \u201cSpider Legs,\u201d the teenage narrator goes to Paris to visit her mother, who is writing a book about St. Agnes. Long divorced from the girl\u2019s father, she has chosen as her subject this woman of early Christian Rome, honored by the church for spurning the marriage proposals that would have spared her from suffering and martyrdom. \u201cFor that, she was tortured, shamed, killed, of course,\u201d the narrator\u2019s mother tells her with a wry smile. \u201cNo sense of self-preservation, those saints.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Although Lazarin\u2019s work has the tone and style of traditional mainstream short fiction, it joins a growing canon of quietly realist stories that establish women\u2019s experiences as worthy of literary attention. And not just women\u2019s experiences: These stories also explore the exhausting, slow poison of masculine power, the grind of the patriarchy on even the most privileged of women, the subtle ways in which men have trained women to minimize themselves.\n\nThe hunger for these types of stories is powerful. How else to explain the ferocious explosion of emotion aroused by Kristen Roupenian\u2019s New Yorker story \u201cCat Person\u201d? It shared many qualities with Lazarin\u2019s work \u2014 quiet, literary, realist \u2014 but it made a particular generation of women feel as if they were about to crawl out of their skin, as if they suddenly remembered how bad things had been, how bad they could be, how bad they could get.\n\nIn \u201cAmerican Men in Paris I Did Not Love,\u201d Lazarin\u2019s narrator finds herself in the presence of an insufferable pedant who is probably married and certainly has designs on her. \u201cWe spend four hours together,\u201d she notes flatly, \u201cbefore I remember that I can just get up and go.\u201d And so these stories hand their warnings to us: Don\u2019t be pleasant or easy to teach.

These included \u201cInside Amy Schumer\u201d (which won the accommodating Schumer an Emmy for best variety sketch show); \u201cTransparent\u201d (which won its creator, Jill Soloway, an Emmy for directing); and the Golden Globe comedy nominees \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d (created by Jenji Kohan), \u201cGirls\u201d (the signature work of Lena Dunham) and \u201cJane the Virgin\u201d (developed by Jennie Snyder Urman). Meanwhile, the powerhouse producer Shonda Rhimes dominated network television on Thursday nights with \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy,\u201d \u201cScandal\u201d and \u201cHow to Get Away With Murder\u201d (created by \u201cGrey\u2019s\u201d supervising producer Peter Nowalk).\n\nPhoto\n\nNot unrealistically, the happy publication tie-in that Press expected and hoped for as her work got underway was the election of Hillary Clinton to become the first female president of the United States; the Democratic candidate\u2019s triumph would be the history-making climax of a campaign supported by many of the same industry women Press was interviewing. Dunham, for one, stumped indefatigably on Clinton\u2019s behalf. Rhimes and her producing partner, Betsy Beers, made the video that introduced Clinton at the 2016 Democratic convention. Diane English, who dreamed up the conversation-setting feminist sitcom \u201cMurphy Brown\u201d in the Reaganite 1980s, backed a pro-Clinton super PAC.\n\nWe know the Big Reveal. By the time the author, a former TV critic for The Village Voice, finished her book, Donald Trump had become the first fake-reality-TV character to occupy the Oval Office. \u201cWhat looked like the forward march of progress turned out to be one of history\u2019s grand zigzags,\u201d Press says in her realistically dismayed introduction. And so began the rising up of a new, very real, very raw female impatience with the same-old, same-old ways of gender inequality in politics; and in the workplace; and in the arts, media, industrial life, military life, factory life, corporate life and even in cartoon-superhero life, what with lady heroes condemned to run around in constricting bustiers.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe rising up continues. Nothing on the air seems quite so funny or delightful anymore, and the scripted shows meant to shock, provoke and amuse, whether about trans sexuality within the family (\u201cTransparent\u201d), murder as oh-hello (\u201cScandal\u201d) or weird sex stuff that women are jolly about (\u201cBroad City,\u201d made by Abbi Jacobson and Ilana Glazer), don\u2019t cause nearly as much shock as the testimony of real women talking about what they experience during working hours.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe litany of imbalances sounds repetitious only because gender inequality repeats itself daily, while the latest headline-making abuses are discussed as if fantastic plot twists in an outrageous soap. And so, between the long-ago year of 2015 and now, the agitation continues, hashtags flying, with ramifications for pop culture and the business behind it that go considerably beyond the scope of Press\u2019s investigation.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn other words, \u201cStealing the Show\u201d at times feels a little bereft of urgency.\n\nThen again. Here is a collection of women who have managed to make television on their own terms, embodying proof that it can be done. Press gives a properly respectful nod to Gertrude Berg, who wrote, starred in and produced \u201cThe Goldbergs\u201d from 1949 to 1955, calling her \u201cthe founding mother of the American TV sitcom.\u201d She makes quick, appropriate bows to \u201cI Love Lucy\u201d (and Lucille Ball), \u201cThat Girl\u201d (and Marlo Thomas) and \u201cThe Mary Tyler Moore Show\u201d (and its namesake). She learns from Barbara Corday, who, with her writing partner Barbara Avedon, launched the breakout female-cop-buddy drama \u201cCagney & Lacey\u201d in 1982, that the seed of the show\u2019s idea was inspired, in a roundabout way, by the feminist critic Molly Haskell\u2019s essential critique \u201cFrom Reverence to Rape: The Treatment of Women in the Movies.\u201d", "keywords": ["televised", "writing", "tv", "life", "work", "stealing", "won", "women", "press", "television", "revolution", "female"], "polarity": 0.18218982275586054, "subjectivity": 0.45402372784448247},

The descendant of an old-money family that had lost its fortune by her father\u2019s generation, she attended an East Coast boarding school, then went to Yale on scholarship.

In fact, the stories are similar: Both use the children\u2019s school as a stage, with the parents as the stars. \u201cMrs.\u201d is set among the Manhattan 1-percenters who count wine cellars and his-and-hers drivers as necessities, just as the TV version of \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d is set among the wealthy of Monterey. And as both stories unfold, the pursuit of luxurious lifestyles becomes incidental to survival, revenge and redemption.\n\nConsider a scene from \u201cMrs.\u201d that might as well have been directed by Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e. Two mothers confront John D. Curtis and engage him in combat, eventually wresting from his wife an overdue debt. One takes off with her compensation (from an assignation-turned-assault during her \u201cBelle du Jour\u201d days), and as she strides away with her children, crisp hundred-dollar bills sail out of her pockets.\n\nThe remaining parents regard one another in stunned silence. Do they chase the money? Of course! Even masters of the capitalist universe and their flawless wives are soon scampering after the floating bills, stooping to the sidewalk, \u201cone with a stomp of the foot, the other on his knees, shooting out a hand.\u201d It\u2019s the children who look on, aghast.\n\nThe boldest thing about \u201cMrs.\u201d \u2014 as with \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d \u2014 is that it focuses on the depths of women\u2019s experiences as wives and mothers. Their clashes with one another are entertaining, sure, but they\u2019re a diversion from the more important conflict with their husbands and with male power. \u201cMrs.\u201d could easily have been a glossy, rushed novel about bitchy, bored housewives nursing social resentment. Plenty of those have been published, passing from memory as quickly as the pages fly under your fingers. But Macy hasn\u2019t written that kind of book. Although Philippa, Minnie and Gwen aren\u2019t smash-the-patriarchy crusaders for social justice, they recognize the violent, self-flattering, corrupt man in their midst and they deliver him, finally, to justice \u2014 even if it comes at the expense of other lives.", "keywords": ["social", "wealthy", "parents", "macy", "lies", "upper", "school", "turf", "wars", "novel", "mothers", "style", "ultrawealthy", "east", "mrs", "little"], "polarity": 0.08597234576686631, "subjectivity": 0.5817487991460596},

(\u201cYes,\u201d he replied. \u201cBut only because you already told me that last week.\u201d)\n\nPhoto\n\nIn these books, the women who shaped the American narrative come to life with refreshing attention to detail. \u201cVotes for Women\u201d opens with a minibiography of Elizabeth Cady Stanton, set up as a cinematic hero\u2019s journey from that fateful moment when her father, mourning the death of his last son, told his daughter he wished she had been born a boy. Zimet is less wide-eyed and more unsentimental in her approach. Opting for frankness about the racism of Stanton\u2019s platform, for instance, she contextualizes but also condemns her use of the atrocious term \u201cSambo.\u201d\n\nOf course, no women were more oppressed than women of color, and their stories are buried even deeper than those of the few celebrity suffragists who make it into stock history lessons. \u201cRoses and Radicals\u201d and \u201cVotes for Women\u201d both remind us of this fact through the inclusion of Sojourner Truth\u2019s 1851 \u201cAin\u2019t I a Woman\u201d speech at a women\u2019s rights meeting in Akron, Ohio. \u201cTruth was demanding that her listeners understand that women\u2019s rights weren\u2019t merely a matter for white women,\u201d Zimet writes. There are listeners today who still need help understanding this. Imagine if the most fundamental realities of women\u2019s intersecting identities were taken into consideration in history class.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne woman of color in particular is at the center of Amy Hill Hearth\u2019s STREETCAR TO JUSTICE: How Elizabeth Jennings Won the Right to Ride in New York (HarperCollins, 160 pp., $19.99; ages 8 to 12). In 1854, a century before Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on a Montgomery bus, there was Jennings\u2019s defiant bravery on a streetcar in the Five Points neighborhood of New York. Wrapped up in Hearth\u2019s detailing of Jennings\u2019s courage is a sobering recognition that the shame of our nation\u2019s history was widespread. Slavery wasn\u2019t restricted to the South. In fact, New York City itself was home to a municipal slave market until 1762. Writing with a compassionate hand-holding tone perhaps best suited for readers on the younger end of the book\u2019s suggested age range, Hearth reminds us that Jennings was not only blocked from riding in a streetcar, she also faced institutionalized obstacles. \u201cFor blacks, both boys and girls, the road to success was blocked by the color of their skin,\u201d she explains. \u201cOnly a very few managed to break through the barriers, and when they did, they still were not considered equal to whites.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThings hadn\u2019t improved much nearly 100 years later, during the time that Melba Pattillo Beals writes about in her shocking autobiography, MARCH FORWARD, GIRL: From Young Warrior to Little Rock Nine (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 224 pp., $16.99; ages 10 and up). This book looks at Beals\u2019s younger years, before she was part of the Little Rock Nine who integrated Central High School (as she recounts in her best-selling \u201cWarriors Don\u2019t Cry\u201d). In empathetic yet unflinching prose respectful of younger readers, Beals depicts the nightmarish way the KKK held sway over the lives of black people. \u201cThe first thing I remember about being a person living in Little Rock, Ark., during the 1940s is the gut-wrenching fear in my heart and tummy that I was in danger,\u201d she begins. \u201cBy age 3, I realized the culture of this small town in the Deep South was such that the color of my skin framed the entire scope of my life.\u201d Beals candidly details the origins of her activism, as her fear transforms into rage over the passivity of the tormented adults who felt they could do nothing. There is in this new book even more untold history, more pain, outright terror and forgotten bravery, and yet so little has changed.\n\nIt\u2019s thrilling to think of girls and young women immersed in not just history-book bullet points, but entire chapters fleshing out the stories of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Elizabeth Jennings. Previously, a curious child might have found these depictions in the pages of a dusty encyclopedia, and only if she knew where to look. We have been denied the full reality of our past, both its injustices and its secret heroes. It is still true that the road to success is blocked by both skin color and gender.\n\nEach victory in these pages is hung with the spoiler alert that we have yet to pass the Equal Rights Amendment. These books are an assertion of the female narrative, containing anger about the past, while arming a new generation with information they need to create a hopeful future.

In \u201cJane Eyre,\u201d she wrote from the first-person perspective of a child, an innovation that gave voice and power even to the very young; she created, too, a heroine who was, like Bront\u00eb herself, plain, pale, small, and yet frankly desirous, as well as worthy of desire.\n\nBront\u00eb once wrote to a friend that she considered the marital ambitions of women of no means or beauty \u201can imbecility which I reject with contempt,\u201d a practical response to the frank injustices of class and a kind of sexism. In her novels, however, those same plain women are entitled to not just any marriages, but to passionate, loving ones. The interior lives of Jane Eyre and Lucy Snowe are shared in such detail that the characters\u2019 unfair burdens are plainly manifest; Bront\u00eb could make great sweeping plotlines of the small moments and humiliations in an unmarried woman\u2019s life. Lucy Snowe\u2019s struggle to find a private place to read a long-awaited letter reads, over several pages, with the suspense and drama of a Spenserian quest.\n\nA miniaturist of the soul, Bront\u00eb captured shades of emotion with a psychological subtlety that still feels exquisitely modern. When Lucy Snowe, battling depression, is advised to cultivate her own happiness, her strong response will feel familiar to many a 21st-century person who has the condition: \u201cNo mockery in this world ever sounds to me so hollow as that of being told to cultivate happiness,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHappiness is not a potato to be planted in mould and tilled with manure.\u201d\n\nShe had a mordant wit, which could protect her only so much from the series of losses that left her so fragile. \u201cIt is useless to tell you how I live,\u201d she wrote to a friend in 1851. \u201cI endure life \u2014 but whether I enjoy it or not is another question.\u201d She startled readily, and wrote to friends complaining of crushing insomnia, a poor appetite, grief and flashbacks; she put off writing letters for fear of how dejected she would feel if the replies came too slowly. Her two most intense romantic passions \u2014 one, involving a married Belgian school master, was meticulously memorialized in \u201cVillette\u201d; the other, for her publisher, George Smith (also captured in the characteristics of a doctor in \u201cVillette\u201d) \u2014 were both unrequited.\n\nBut reader, she married, eventually, at the age of 38, choosing Arthur Bell Nicholls, a pastor who worked for Bront\u00eb\u2019s father. Although she acknowledged frankly that he was not her intellectual equal, he pursued her persistently, and against her father\u2019s wishes, possibly imbuing a late-in-life courtship with a jolt of romance.\n\nDid Bront\u00eb ultimately find the kind of happiness that she described as \u201ca glory shining far down upon us out of heaven\u201d? In \u201cVillette,\u201d Lucy Snowe describes her own feelings about happiness: \u201cThe negation of severe suffering was the nearest approach to happiness I expected to know. Besides, I seemed to hold two lives \u2014 the life of thought, and that of reality. And provided the former was nourished with a sufficiency of strange and necromantic joys of fancy, the privileges of the latter might remain limited to daily bread, hourly work and a roof of shelter.\u201d Once Bront\u00eb married, however, her life of thought suffered. \u201cMy own life is more occupied than it used to be,\u201d she wrote to a friend. \u201cI have not so much time for thinking.\u201d\n\nLiterature would no longer be the business of her life; whether the pleasures of marriage could offset that loss remains unclear. To one friend, she wrote, \u201cIt is a solemn and strange and perilous thing for a woman to become a wife.\u201d But several months later, she wrote, \u201cI have a good, kind attached husband, and every day makes my own attachment to him stronger.\u201d", "keywords": ["lucy", "novelist", "wrote", "married", "snowe", "known", "eyre", "bront\u00eb", "jane", "life", "friend", "women", "villette", "overlooked", "happiness", "charlotte"], "polarity": 0.15464722412090828, "subjectivity": 0.4587040517961569},

Ms. Adichie\u2019s first of 15 suggestions places a mother\u2019s freedom and growth at the center of a daughter\u2019s feminist education.\n\n\u201cBe a full person,\u201d Ms. Adichie writes. \u201cMotherhood is a glorious gift, but do not define yourself solely by motherhood.\u201d\n\nThe book grew partly out of the desire of Ms. Adichie\u2019s friend, called Ijeawele in the text, to teach her daughter \u201cto take less of the nonsense\u201d that past generations faced. Ms. Adichie wrote her friend a letter in 2015 and published it on Facebook last year.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The responses she received made her even more sure that it was an important piece to write.\n\n\u201cEven friends of mine \u2014 people I love \u2014 wrote, \u2018why yes, we kind of agree, but why call it feminist? It\u2019s just common sense.\u2019 And I\u2019m like no, it\u2019s feminist,\u201d Ms. Adichie said. \u201cOr, oh it\u2019s just humanism. Or someone said, \u2018these are just democratic ideals.\u2019 And I thought, what? It\u2019s everything but to acknowledge the fact that gender is a problem.\u201d\n\nMs. Adichie wrote the letter before she was a parent, but now she has a 17-month-old daughter whom she is trying to raise as a feminist. She and her husband split their time between Nigeria, where she grew up, and the United States.\n\nMs. Adichie often comments on how race and gender play out in the United States, but her book does not tackle some of the meatier questions that have occupied the American feminist movement in recent years, most notably the role of transgender people.\n\nOn this book tour, after we spoke, Ms. Adichie made controversial comments suggesting that transgender women experience male privilege before they transition. For activists who have been grappling with these questions for years, the comments came across as ill-informed. Asked about them, Ms. Adichie suggested through a spokesman that people go to her Facebook page, where she has posted several responses, acknowledging that her comments \u201cupset many people, and I consider their concerns to be valid.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see how my saying that we should not conflate the gender experiences of trans women with that of women born female could appear as if I was suggesting that one experience is more important than the other. Or that the experiences of trans women are less valid than those of women born female,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI do not think so at all \u2014 I know that trans women can be vulnerable in ways that women born female are not.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Adichie has written about Hillary Clinton for The Atlantic and Michelle Obama in T: The New York Times Style Magazine, and last summer wrote a short story in The Times imagining Melania Trump\u2019s experience on the campaign trail. Although she was an enthusiastic Hillary Clinton supporter in the election, she sees Mrs. Trump as a sympathetic character.\n\n\u201cI think there is some misogyny in the way she\u2019s been characterized, and I think it\u2019s ugly,\u201d Ms. Adichie said. She becomes animated talking about the vitriol aimed at Mrs. Trump, in the same way she bristles when asked about how Mrs. Clinton was treated during the campaign. She is concerned with how society responds to powerful women across the political spectrum.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even like talking about it, because I get very upset,\u201d she said while describing the media\u2019s focus on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s \u201clikability.\u201d (One of the suggestions in her book is for mothers to teach daughters to \u201creject likability.\u201d)\n\nMs. Adichie will not say what she\u2019s working on next \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m very superstitious\u201d \u2014 but continues to write and throw herself into her international speaking engagements. The satisfaction she takes in her work is at the heart of her proposal: To raise feminist daughters, mothers must take pleasure in their own achievements, follow both the challenges and delights of the work, and give themselves room to fail. Ultimately, as Ms. Adichie writes, they must be full people.", "keywords": ["book", "wrote", "adichie", "ngozi", "blueprint", "york", "chimamanda", "feminist", "think", "women", "ms", "mothers", "feminism", "mrs", "adichies"], "polarity": 0.14795013628346965, "subjectivity": 0.43228626654552577}
