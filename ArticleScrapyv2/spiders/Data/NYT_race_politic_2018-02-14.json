", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/14/upshot/the-trump-administration-is-optimistic-about-economic-growth-be-skeptical.html", "text": "Advertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Trump Administration Is Optimistic About Economic Growth. Be Skeptical. For its forecast to come true would require productivity improvements not seen in decades and an atypical policy on interest rates.\n\nPresident Trump has been nothing if not bold in his promises to generate supercharged economic growth.\n\nWhen a report showed a strong 3.3 percent growth rate last fall, he said, \u201cI see no reason why we don\u2019t go to 4 percent, 5 percent, and even 6 percent,\u201d and he has spoken wistfully of emerging economies where growth can reach higher than that.\n\nEven if you treat those musings as presidential bombast, his administration is making detailed projections that the economy will expand much faster in the decade ahead than it has in recent years \u2014 a forecast that underpins the Trump policy agenda.\n\nThe administration forecasts growth in the neighborhood of 3 percent through the next decade, compared with around 2 percent projected by private forecasters and the economists at the Congressional Budget Office and the Federal Reserve. If the administration\u2019s forecast comes true, it will imply an economy 12 percent bigger in 2028 than that projected by the more cautious forecasts \u2014 an extra $2.8 trillion in economic activity that year, in today\u2019s dollars.\n\nBut when you look closely at the details of the forecast, not all of it quite adds up. To come true, it would require some of the strongest improvements in productivity seen in decades, yet also require that interest rates not react the way they have historically when growth strengthens.\n\nTo understand some of the Trump administration\u2019s buoyant assumptions and the apparent contradictions buried within them, it helps to go step by step on where economic growth comes from and how it relates to interest rates, employment and inflation.\n\nCapital spending can fuel higher growth, but not forever\n\nThink of the simplest arithmetic on how a single company can produce more goods and services. There are three ways:\n\nWorkers can put in more hours of labor. If the company hires more people, or has current workers do longer shifts, it can increase production.\n\nThe business can invest in more capital to make workers more effective. The latest equipment or software can mean each hour of labor creates more stuff.\n\nThe business can adjust its management techniques and how it operates to try to get more productivity out of the same workers and equipment.\n\nThe same idea applies to the economy as a whole. Growth comes from either more hours being worked, or more capital for each worker, or the third, which is called \u201ctotal factor productivity.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration leans heavily on the second of these \u2014 more capital \u2014 as justification for its optimism. With lower taxes on business, as well as regulatory policies that are more favorable to capital, the budget statement says, it will unleash \u201cgrowth-enhancing policies\u201d in terms of more capital in the economy per worker.\n\nIt is indeed plausible that these policies will encourage more capital investment in the next few years, said Joel Prakken, chief U.S. economist at Macroeconomic Advisers, with higher productivity growth as a consequence.\n\nBut that should be a one-time adjustment, after businesses increase their capital stock in response to more favorable policies. Once that process is complete and has resulted in higher productivity, there\u2019s no reason to think that capital investment would keep rising as a share of the economy.\n\nIn other words, the benefits in terms of productivity growth and economic growth should fade over time, which the administration acknowledges.\n\n\u201cThe new tax law would be a one-time shift, spread out over several years, after which there would be a new steady state growth path for labor productivity,\u201d DJ Nordquist, chief of staff at the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said in an email. \u201cNevertheless, in that new steady state, faster growth than we have seen in recent years can still be expected because of the elimination of excessive regulations, to which this administration is committed and because of our infrastructure plan. This deregulation will have enduring benefits to the rate of growth.\u201d\n\nSome private economists are not persuaded these effects are powerful enough to account for continued strong growth a decade from now. \u201cI try to fit these numbers into a mainstream paradigm and I can\u2019t make them fit,\u201d Mr. Prakken said.\n\nWhat about other sources of growth?\n\nBut even if higher capital investment can\u2019t do all the lifting of generating 3 percent growth, there remain those other two possibilities, of hours worked or total factor productivity, that could help achieve the 3 percent growth forecast even after the lift from tax cuts and capital investment fades.\n\nBut demographic trends are putting a lid on potential growth from more hours of work. The retirement of the baby boomers and stabilization of the proportion of women in the work force mean that potential hours worked will rise only 0.4 percent a year in the coming decade, according to the C.B.O.\u2019s forecast (compared with 1.3 percent a year from 1950 to 2016).\n\nMoreover, the Trump administration\u2019s immigration policies, if anything, would tilt that number in a negative direction, as deportations, tighter border security and more restrictive issuance of work visas reduces the potential supply of labor.\n\nMs. Nordquist argued that Trump administration policies would help increase the labor force, and hence growth potential.\n\n\u201cWe think that labor force participation has dropped in the past decade in part because of government policies that discourage work,\u201d said Ms. Norquist, including growth in Social Security disability insurance and the Affordable Care Act. \u201cThere is much room for the Trump administration to improve on those policies, for example through marginal individual income tax rate cuts,\u201d citing evidence that older, near-retirement workers may be more likely to work when taxes are lower.\n\nThen there\u2019s total factor productivity, the black-box driver of growth. Economists don\u2019t really understand it, and calculate it only as a residual \u2014 it is the number left over after calculating how much a rise in output comes from more hours worked or more capital.\n\nIt would be great for the long-term prospects for the economy \u2014 and for the Trump administration\u2019s forecast \u2014 if total factor productivity started rising faster. But it\u2019s hard to predict, and it doesn\u2019t show much relationship with either corporate taxes or government regulation. For example, it was quite high from 1950 to 1973, when corporate income taxes were between 48 and 52 percent (they were recently cut to 21 percent). And it was quite low from 1982 to 1990, amid the Reagan era tax cuts and deregulation.\n\nThe interest rate paradox\n\nSuppose the Trump administration\u2019s growth forecast really does materialize: Tax cuts and deregulation fuel productivity-enhancing capital spending; some good fortune arises in terms of the labor force and total factor productivity; and economic growth returns to its pre-2000 norm of around 3 percent. That would be positive news for the economy. But it also would be likely to have other effects, particularly on interest rates.\n\nOver time, interest rates tend to move in tandem with the nominal growth rate. Part of the reason interest rates have fallen sharply in the last decade is that low growth has translated into what economists call a low \u201cnatural rate\u201d of interest and low inflation levels.\n\nBut the Trump administration projects similar interest rates to those envisioned by more cautious forecasters, despite projecting higher growth.\n\nIt implies something of an immaculate expansion: returning to pre-2000 growth rates without also returning to pre-2000 interest rates.\n\nIn the 1990s, for example, G.D.P. growth averaged 3.3 percent per year, and the 10-year Treasury bond yield averaged 6.7 percent. The administration projects economic growth nearly that strong, but rates peaking at 3.7 percent.\n\nEven some who are on board with more optimistic forecasts of growth say that higher interest rates and inflation are likely to accompany it. Allen Sinai, a longtime forecaster, shares the administration\u2019s view that businesses will invest in more capital because of the tax law, thus achieving higher productivity.\n\nBut in addition to that, he argues, the economy will be at risk of overheating. He sees inflation rising to between 2.5 percent and 3 percent by late 2019, which could send long-term Treasury bond yields up to 5 percent, well above the 2.9 percent today and the 3.1 percent the administration forecasts for 2019.\n\n\u201cAt some point inflation gets high enough, and the market takes interest rates up,\u201d said Mr. Sinai, the chief economist at Decision Economics. And higher rates, it\u2019s worth adding, would raise the cost for the government to service the national debt, in turn making deficits higher.\n\nMs. Nordquist notes that the forecasts published Monday were developed in November, when interest rates were lower than they are now. \u201cIf we were to redo the interest rate forecast today, we would project higher rates,\u201d she said.\n\nThe art of the forecast\n\nHave some sympathy for those who build these forecasts. Predicting anything 10 years in advance is inherently hard, and no forecast is ever perfectly correct. As the last 10 years show, there is a lot that is just unknowable about the forces that will buffet the economy.\n\nBut you do want those forecasts to line up with what we already know about the economic and demographic forces that will shape the future. And a lot will have to go right for the Trump administration\u2019s forecasts to come true.\n\nCorrection : Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the gender of DJ Nordquist, the chief of staff of the White House Council of Economic Advisers.

She said she was not aware that anyone at the security office disclosed in March to any official in the West Wing that there were problems with Mr. Porter\u2019s background check.\n\nApril 24\n\nMs. Willoughby published a blog post titled \u201cWhy I Stayed,\u201d in which she described an abusive marriage with Mr. Porter, but did not name him.

The White House disputed that assertion, saying that Mr. McGahn was unaware of any problem.\n\nMs. Sanders said Tuesday that the security office believed that the F.B.I. report in July \u201crequired significant additional investigatory fieldwork\u201d before security officials could decide whether to recommend a security clearance for Mr. Porter. They asked the F.B.I. to do more work on it, she said.\n\nSeptember\n\nAccording to Ms. Willoughby, White House officials informed Mr. Porter that his security clearance \u201chad not gone through,\u201d as she recalled him saying.

They said security office officials encouraged the F.B.I. to complete its investigation so the office could make a final decision on Mr. Porter\u2019s clearance.\n\nMs. Sanders said she was not aware that anyone in the security office communicated in November to any senior official in the West Wing about problems with Mr. Porter\u2019s background investigation.\n\nBut multiple people familiar with the situation have said top officials \u2014 including Mr. McGahn; John F.

The woman, who knew Mr. McGahn well, was upset because she had discovered that Mr. Porter was also dating Hope Hicks, the White House communications director.

Credit Eric Thayer for The New York Times\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee has been reconsidering his decision to retire this year, but Mr. Corker\u2019s hopes for retaining his seat are running into a potentially insurmountable object: President Trump.\n\nJust over four months after Mr. Corker, upon declaring he would retire, unleashed a biting series of attacks on Mr. Trump, the president is refusing to bless his friend-turned-foe\u2019s effort to re-enter the Republican primary race.\n\nInstead, in a telephone conversation last week, Mr. Trump offered encouragement to Representative Marsha Blackburn, a conservative lawmaker and White House ally who has emerged as the favorite to win the Republican nomination for Mr. Corker\u2019s seat, according to three Republicans familiar with the call.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s West Wing advisers, their memories still fresh from Mr. Corker\u2019s jibes, are urging the president to resist entreaties from the senator and a handful of his colleagues who worry that the seat could slip from Republican hands in November. They are showing Mr. Trump polling that indicates how steep of a climb Mr. Corker would face in a primary campaign.\n\nIf Mr. Trump does not change course, his silence could effectively doom any hopes Mr. Corker has for seeking a third term. The president is highly popular among Tennessee Republicans and may be the only person who could reverse Mr. Corker\u2019s standing with primary voters, who have soured on him since he portrayed Mr. Trump as a juvenile in need of day care, whose instability may push the country into World War III.\n\nAnd without Mr. Trump\u2019s direct intervention, Ms. Blackburn is highly unlikely to bow to Mr. Corker.\n\n\u201cMarsha Blackburn is not getting out of this race regardless of who gets in,\u201d said Ward Baker, the Nashville-area lawmaker\u2019s chief strategist.\n\nFurther, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, has rebuffed Mr. Corker by telling him that he must secure the president\u2019s support to re-enter the race, according to Republicans familiar with the conversation, a rare act of political deference that suggests he is uneasy about driving Ms. Blackburn out of the primary race.\n\nBut Mr. Corker and some of his Senate allies are aggressively working to win over the White House, embarking on what one West Wing official described as a sudden charm offensive. The senator has avoided any criticism of Mr. Trump in recent weeks and on Monday met with Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s daughter.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s political advisers, getting wind of the meeting, scrambled to brief Ms. Trump and her own staff about Mr. Corker\u2019s renewed interest in running again and his desire for the president\u2019s support, according to a Republican official. An aide to Mr. Corker said Ms. Trump requested the meeting.\n\nMore broadly, Mr. Corker\u2019s advisers say he and Mr. Trump have patched up their relationship and the senator is simply hearing out those who would like him to remain in the Senate, a decision he technically does not have to make until Tennessee\u2019s filing deadline in early April.\n\n\u201cIn recent days, people across Tennessee have reached out to Senator Corker with concerns about the outcome of this election because they believe it could determine control of the Senate and the future of our agenda,\u201d said Micah Johnson, Mr. Corker\u2019s spokeswoman.\n\nMr. Corker is not the only Republican who could shake up a closely watched Senate race. Representative Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, who had been heavily courted by Mr. Trump and other leading Republicans but decided against a bid, is now signaling that he may mount a bid after all against Senator Heidi Heitkamp, North Dakota\u2019s freshman Democrat.\n\nImage Representative Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee at the Republican National Convention in 2016 in Cleveland. Credit Jim Young/Reuters\n\nIf Mr. Cramer\u2019s potential change of heart is lifting Republicans\u2019 spirits, the party is now uneasy about the prospect of having one too many Republicans in Tennessee.\n\nMr. Corker\u2019s hopes for a rapprochement with Mr. Trump illustrate the degree to which loyalty to the president is becoming a central litmus test in Republican politics. And that he might consider a reconciliation with a senator who only a few months ago portrayed him as an unruly toddler underscores that there are no permanent friends or enemies to Mr. Trump.\n\nBut party officials overseeing the midterms have little appetite for a bloody primary campaign in Tennessee.\n\nDemocrats have cleared their field for Phil Bredesen, a wealthy former two-term governor and mayor of Nashville whose prospects in an increasingly conservative state would markedly improve if he faced a Republican limping into a general election.\n\nFurther, in a season full of disappointments across the Senate Republican map, Ms. Blackburn has been a bright spot, raising $2 million in the final quarter of last year, contributing to other candidates and uniting most of the party\u2019s factions.\n\n\u201cShe is raising more money and doing more than any other candidate in country,\u201d said Josh Holmes, a Republican consultant and adviser to Mr. McConnell.\n\nMs. Blackburn, who was already facing former Representative Stephen Fincher in the primary, is signaling that if she is forced to take on Mr. Corker she will wield her gender as a political weapon. That would raise a delicate issue for a Senate Republican caucus that includes just five women in its ranks.\n\n\u201cAnyone who thinks Marsha Blackburn can\u2019t win a general election is just a plain sexist pig,\u201d said Andrea Bozek, a spokeswoman for Ms. Blackburn, adding, \u201cWe aren\u2019t worried about these ego-driven, tired old men.\u201d\n\nThat is an unmistakable reference to a bloc of establishment-aligned Tennessee Republicans who believe Ms. Blackburn\u2019s conservative politics and hard-charging style may turn off some voters and make her vulnerable against the centrist and low-key Mr. Bredesen.\n\nTom Ingram, a Republican strategist and a longtime friend of Mr. Corker\u2019s, argued that Republicans could imperil the seat and their one-seat majority if they do not rally around an incumbent who has already won the state twice.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a dicey race with an unproven statewide candidate against Phil Bredesen,\u201d Mr. Ingram said. \u201cIf Corker is the nominee, it\u2019s not in play.\u201d\n\nFueling the anxieties of some Tennessee Republicans is the openness some in the party\u2019s donor wing have toward backing Mr. Bredesen. Concerns about such defections cropped up again this week when an invitation to a $5,400-per-couple Bredesen fund-raiser hosted by the widow of the former Nashville Republican powerhouse Ted Welch began circulating among Republicans.\n\nSuch talk induces eye-rolling among a younger generation of Republicans in Tennessee.\n\n\u201cEvery Republican in Tennessee outside the walls of the Belle Meade Country Club believes Marsha is a heavy favorite against anybody who might get in that primary,\u201d said Brad Todd, a Republican consultant raised in the state who is not aligned in the Senate race.\n\nOrder Reprints | Today\u2019s Paper | Subscribe A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A 14 of the New York edition with the headline: Trump Aid Is Crucial As Corker Ponders Run\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign Up for the Morning Briefing Get what you need to know to start your day in the United States, Canada and the Americas, delivered to your inbox.

But Mr. Schumer objected, on the grounds that such a measure is unrelated to DACA. Without the Democratic leader\u2019s consent, debate cannot begin until midnight Tuesday, or very early Wednesday morning. Republicans were left fuming in frustration.\n\n\u201cThis is the debate they said they wanted,\u201d Mr. McConnell, sounding irked, told reporters Tuesday. \u201cI said we\u2019d have an open and fair process.

But the proposal, drafted by a group of Republicans led by Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, does not appear to have garnered the backing of 60 senators.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOther proposals are also floating around the Capitol, including a \u201cskinny bill\u201d or \u201ctwo-pillar bill\u201d that would pair an extension of the DACA program with money for border security.

Mr. Trump\u2019s budget assumes that effort will now succeed, somehow. Party leaders have downplayed suggestions floated by Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, among others, that Congress could move this year to reduce future spending on safety net programs such as Medicare and Social Security.\n\n\u201cRepublicans will still tell you that runaway spending hurts the economy,\u201d said Brian Riedl, a senior fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute who is a former chief economist for Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio. But the party, he said, \u201cisn\u2019t even talking about Social Security and Medicare reform anymore. And that to me is the sea change. There\u2019s no constituency for it, and Republicans have essentially given up.\u201d\n\nWhile Mr. Trump has pushed to freeze or roll back regulations in Washington, his election \u2014 and the unpredictability of his administration \u2014 has coincided with a resurgence of uncertainty in the United States.\n\nSince Mr. Trump won election in November 2016, an index of economic policy uncertainty, developed by economists from Stanford University, the University of Chicago and Northwestern University, has jumped 25 percent from its average level for the preceding four years. Mr. Trump has regularly dangled the possibility of quitting the North American Free Trade Agreement, for example, and his signature tax law sets all of its individual cuts, and a key business provision, to expire in a few years.\n\nDemocrats look at that evolution and see Republicans revealing a new set of economic preferences for the Trump era: lower taxes, less regulation, more federal spending \u2014 including an infrastructure proposal that could further swell the deficit \u2014 and mounting piles of federal debt.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Bush \u2014 the very policies that conservatives blamed for their party losing its way, and control of Congress, in 2006.\n\n\u201cOn certainty, smaller deficits and less government spending, I do see shifts,\u201d said Michael R. Strain, an economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think those shifts are as significant as many are making them out to be. George W. Bush inherited a budget surplus and left large deficits. He expanded Medicare without paying for it. Dick Cheney said \u2018deficits don\u2019t matter.\u2019 Reagan said that the deficit is big enough to take care of itself. The G.O.P. has not restrained federal spending when it has held the White House.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe official line, from the White House to congressional leadership, is that Republicans remain committed to spending restraint, but have been forced by Democrats to cut deals that run up more spending. That is their rationale for last week\u2019s agreement to lift Obama-era restraints on defense and nondefense discretionary spending by $300 billion, in order to secure the defense spending increases that conservatives say are crucial to national security. (Many also contend that the new tax law will generate enough growth to offset any lost federal revenues, although no detailed independent analysis supports that claim.)\n\nSome leading conservative economists say the party has not lost its core convictions on spending and debt, which, they contend, remain solely a problem of rising safety net spending in the years to come as the population ages and the Baby Boom generation retires from the work force.\n\n\u201cI think their view all along has been that spending and debt are not immediate threats to growth,\u201d said John H. Cochrane, an economist who is a senior fellow at Stanford University\u2019s Hoover Institution. \u201cThey know that right now, a fundamental reform of entitlements won\u2019t happen. So, they have avoided weekly chaos and gotten needed military spending through by opening the spending bill, and they got an important reduction in growth-distorting marginal corporate rates through by accepting a bit more deficits. They know that can\u2019t be the end of the story.\u201d\n\nMr. Cochrane likened the economic threat of rising spending and debt to living on an earthquake fault, poised to rumble at any moment. He said those risks may be making markets \u201cjittery\u201d, and that Republicans may be running out of time to follow through on their convictions, but he expressed hope that Republicans and Democrats might find a way to work together to reduce future spending growth.\n\nRepublicans declined to make such an agreement under Mr. Obama, who was willing to reduce Social Security spending but wanted to increase taxes as part of a deal. They seem unlikely to make that gamble now under Mr. Trump, who, many conservative economists note, promised in his campaign not to touch Social Security or Medicare, and whose actions during last year\u2019s Obamacare repeal debate left some Republican leaders feeling scarred.\n\n\u201cWhen push came to shove last year, he described entitlement reforms as \u2018mean,\u2019 and completely cut their legs out from under them,\u201d said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, an economist who advised President Bush and is now president of the conservative American Action Forum. \u201cSo where do they go from there, with any confidence?\u201d\n\nThe president continues to send mixed signals. On the first page of his budget released Monday, he warned that \u201cthe current fiscal path is unsustainable, and future generations deserve better.\u201d But late last month, in his State of the Union address, deficits and debt were not at the top of Mr. Trump\u2019s mind.

Image A book about \u201cFake News\u201d was displayed last November by a supporter of Roy Moore, who unsuccessfully ran for Senate in Alabama. Credit Brynn Anderson/Associated Press\n\nHow easy is it to change people\u2019s votes in an election?\n\nThe answer, a growing number of studies conclude, is that most forms of political persuasion seem to have little effect at all.\n\nThis conclusion may sound jarring at a time when people are concerned about the effects of the false news articles that flooded Facebook and other online outlets during the 2016 election. Observers speculated that these so-called fake news articles swung the election to Donald J. Trump. Similar suggestions of large persuasion effects, supposedly pushing Mr. Trump to victory, have been made about online advertising from the firm Cambridge Analytica and content promoted by Russian bots.\n\nMuch more remains to be learned about the effects of these types of online activities, but people should not assume they had huge effects. Previous studies have found, for instance, that the effects of even television advertising (arguably a higher-impact medium) are very small. According to one credible estimate, the net effect of exposure to an additional ad shifts the partisan vote of approximately two people out of 10,000.\n\nIn fact, a recent meta-analysis of numerous different forms of campaign persuasion, including in-person canvassing and mail, finds that their average effect in general elections is zero.\n\nField experiments testing the effects of online ads on political candidates and issues have also found null effects. We shouldn\u2019t be surprised \u2014 it\u2019s hard to change people\u2019s minds! Their votes are shaped by fundamental factors like which party they typically support and how they view the state of the economy. \u201cFake news\u201d and bots are likely to have vastly smaller effects, especially given how polarized our politics have become.\n\nHere\u2019s what you should look for in evaluating claims about vast persuasion effects from dubious online content:\n\nHow many people actually saw the questionable material. Many alarming statistics have been produced since the election about how many times \u201cfake news\u201d was shared on Facebook or how many times Russian bots retweeted content on Twitter. These statistics obscure the fact that the content being shared may not reach many Americans (most people are not on Twitter and consume relatively little political news) or even many humans (many bot followers may themselves be bots).\n\nWhether the people being exposed are persuadable. Dubious political content online is disproportionately likely to reach heavy news consumers who already have strong opinions. For instance, a study I conducted with Andrew Guess of Princeton and Jason Reifler of the University of Exeter in Britain showed that exposure to fake news websites before the 2016 election was heavily concentrated among the 10 percent of Americans with the most conservative information diets \u2014 not exactly swing voters.\n\nThe proportion of news people saw that is bogus. The total number of shares or likes that fake news and bots attract can sound enormous until you consider how much information circulates online. Twitter, for instance, reported that Russian bots tweeted 2.1 million times before the election \u2014 certainly a worrisome number. But these represented only 1 percent of all election-related tweets and 0.5 percent of views of election-related tweets.\n\nSimilarly, my study with Mr. Guess and Mr. Reifler found that the mean number of articles on fake news websites visited by Trump supporters was 13.1, but only 40 percent of his supporters visited such websites, and they represented only about 6 percent of the pages they visited on sites focusing on news topics.\n\nNone of these findings indicate that fake news and bots aren\u2019t worrisome signs for American democracy. They can mislead and polarize citizens, undermine trust in the media, and distort the content of public debate. But those who want to combat online misinformation should take steps based on evidence and data, not hype or speculation.\n\nBrendan Nyhan is a professor of government at Dartmouth College.

As of now, there are no plans to cancel or further delay joint military exercises by the United States and South Korea, scheduled for after the Olympic Games.\n\nStill, the tactical shift by the White House opens the door to an unpredictable new phase in the crisis over North Korea. It also shows how the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, has been able to use the Olympics to pursue a thaw with a receptive counterpart in the South.\n\nPresident Trump himself has oscillated between a get-tough approach and a deal maker\u2019s belief that he can sit down with Mr. Kim and work out an agreement. Some of his advisers, like Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, favor engagement; others, like the national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, have pushed for more pressure, backed by the threat of military action.\n\nReports that Washington and Seoul had reached an understanding on the possibility of dialogue appeared in the news media after the vice president\u2019s departure on Saturday, but South Korean officials would not confirm them until Tuesday.\n\nDialogue with the North has been used by successive American administrations as a carrot \u2014 paired with the stick of sanctions \u2014 in the hopes of getting the isolated nation to end its nuclear weapons program. But the Trump administration has long resisted that approach, saying it would not be drawn into a negotiation like that of the Clinton administration in 1994, which resulted in a deal North Korea later broke.\n\nJust six months ago, Mr. Trump described Mr. Moon\u2019s overtures to the North as \u201cappeasement.\u201d When Mr. Tillerson said in December that the United States was willing to hold a \u201cmeeting without precondition,\u201d the White House dismissed his comments as premature.\n\nBut in an interview with The Washington Post after he left South Korea, Mr. Pence suggested that the United States was open to a meeting, even indicating that it would enter talks without preconditions. \u201cThe maximum pressure campaign is going to continue and intensify,\u201d Mr. Pence said of the punishing sanctions imposed on the North by the United Nations. \u201cBut if you want to talk, we\u2019ll talk.\u201d\n\nAgreeing to talks before the North Koreans have demonstrated a willingness to dismantle their weapons program would be a subtle but potentially significant shift in Washington\u2019s approach \u2014 and a win for Mr. Moon.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen Mr. Pence and Mr. Moon met last week, the allies apparently found common ground: They would agree to talks without set rules, but they would continue to use sanctions as leverage.\n\n\u201cPresident Moon and I reflected last night on the need to do something fundamentally different,\u201d Mr. Pence told reporters on Friday after meeting with the South Korean leader.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

She extended an invitation from her brother to Mr. Moon for a summit meeting in North Korea.\n\nMr. Moon, who invited athletes from the North to participate in the Olympics \u2014 where they marched with South Korean athletes under a unified Korean flag during the opening ceremony \u2014 has seen the Games as an important step toward promoting peace on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nDeciphering the Trump administration\u2019s signals on North Korea is tricky, given the president\u2019s unpredictability. Mr. Trump has repeatedly contradicted Mr. Tillerson when he has floated diplomatic openings. But Mr. Pence, officials point out, received his marching orders from Mr. Trump shortly before he left for Asia, and he was unlikely to deviate from them.\n\nThe White House has been relieved by the lull in North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile tests, even as it has watched the emerging d\u00e9tente warily.

Analysts predicted that North Korea would use any future talks with Washington to be accepted as a nuclear power and win large economic concessions, in return for agreeing not to advance its nuclear weapons program any further.\n\nNorth Korea has said that it would not bargain away its weapons, and would only discuss mutual arms reduction \u2014 a vow that American intelligence agencies take seriously.

Of 12 positions deemed most central to the president, only five are still filled by the same person as when Mr. Trump took office.\n\nMr. Trump is on his second press secretary, his second national security adviser and his third deputy national security adviser. Five different people have been named communications director or served in the job in an acting capacity. The president has parted ways with his chief strategist, health secretary, several deputy chiefs of staff and his original private legal team. He is on his second chief of staff \u2014 and some wonder whether a third may be in the offing soon.\n\nSome administration officials privately spend much of their time trying to figure out how to leave without looking disloyal or provoking an easily angered president. Others, like Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, stubbornly resist what seem like clear signals that they are no longer welcome.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still here,\u201d Mr. Tillerson told Fox News last week, months after the White House was reported in The New York Times and elsewhere to have a plan to replace him. \u201cNothing has changed.\u201d Asked if he thought some in the administration were still advocating that he be replaced, Mr. Tillerson said, \u201cI have no idea.\u201d\n\nGrueling in the best of times, an administration job now seems even less appealing to many potential recruits. Republican operatives said they worry not only about the pressure-cooker, soap-opera atmosphere and the danger of being drawn into the special counsel investigation of Russia\u2019s election interference but also about hurting their careers after the White House.\n\nVideo\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t a huge appetite from many Republicans on the outside to explore job opportunities in this administration,\u201d said Ryan Williams, a former spokesman for Mitt Romney, the party\u2019s 2012 presidential nominee. \u201cWhile there are a lot of vacancies and usually a position in the White House is one of the most prestigious jobs in Washington, that\u2019s just not the feeling with this administration, given the turmoil and the chaos.\u201d\n\nJohn F. Kelly was charged with reining in the turmoil and the chaos when he took over as chief of staff last summer, and many credit him with imposing more order on the building and shuffling out some of the more quarrelsome figures. But many White House officials were already souring on Mr. Kelly even before his handling of the abuse allegations against Mr. Porter gave his internal critics new ammunition against him.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Trump has expressed frustration with Mr. Kelly as well, but has sent mixed signals about whether he might replace him.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Omarosa Manigault Newman, a former contestant on Mr. Trump\u2019s reality TV show \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d who worked in the White House until Mr. Kelly pushed her out in December, cried as she described her experiences during a new episode of \u201cThe Celebrity Big Brother\u201d that aired on CBS last week.\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019m there fighting, fighting, fighting, getting my head bashed in, and nobody coming out publicly to say, \u2018We support her,\u2019\u201d she told a fellow competitor. Asked if the nation would be O.K., she said, \u201cNo, it\u2019s going to not be O.K. It\u2019s not.\u201d She added that she would not vote for Mr. Trump again \u201cin a million years, never.\u201d\n\nBeyond those leaving, many positions have never been filled nearly 13 months after the inauguration. Some of those vacancies stem from the glacial pace of background investigations and the Senate confirmation process, which has grown worse with each successive president. But in many cases, the Trump administration has still not identified candidates.\n\nAccording to the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit organization that tracks appointments along with The Washington Post, the Trump administration has made the fewest nominations, not counting those that have failed, and has had the fewest confirmed by this point of any of the last five administrations. At the State Department, nominees have yet to be made for three under secretary positions and 10 assistant secretary positions, senior-level jobs that have traditionally been crucial to managing foreign policy.\n\nNow in its second year, the president\u2019s team is trying to get ahead of the situation. The White House on Friday released a raft of appointments. But a vast majority of the 32 announced were actually just promotions from within, or additional titles for existing staff members.\n\nThe top two appointments on the list were James Carroll as acting national drug policy director and John DeStefano as counselor to the president, both choices that underlined the challenges for the White House.\n\nFor Mr. Carroll, it will be his fourth job in the White House since the administration\u2019s inception; he started in the White House counsel\u2019s office, then became general counsel for the budget office and served most recently as deputy chief of staff. For Mr. DeStefano, the new title was a recognition that he has already effectively been overseeing the offices of personnel, political affairs and public liaison.\n\nThe constant churning exacts a toll. \u201cIt takes time for any group to jell and learn the ropes of governing, and that is definitely complicated by turnover,\u201d said Lisa Brown, a top White House official under Mr. Obama and President Bill Clinton. \u201cEvery new person has to learn the ropes and changes the team dynamic.

Under the rule, oil and gas companies would have been required to capture leaked methane, update their equipment and write new plans for minimizing waste when drilling on government property.\n\nThe Interior Department\u2019s Bureau of Land Management described the rule as costly, redundant and overly burdensome.\n\n\u201cIn order to achieve energy dominance through responsible energy production, we need smart regulations, not punitive regulations,\u201d Joe Balash, the department\u2019s assistant secretary for land and minerals management, said Monday in a statement .\n\nThe move came as the Trump administration released an $11.3 billion budget for the Interior Department that emphasized the development of domestic energy resources and \u201cresponsible development of energy on public lands and offshore waters.\u201d\n\nThe methane waste rule was aimed at accidental gas leaks and the process of venting and burning off leaked gas, known as flaring, from oil and gas wells on public lands. It was created as part of a broad strategy to tackle climate change as well as wasteful releases of gas. The Bureau of Land Management estimated in 2016 that the rule would prevent as much as 180,000 tons of methane emissions annually, about the equivalent of taking 950,000 cars off the road.\n\nThe oil and gas industry argued that the rule could cost as much as $279 million to implement and would hinder production. The industry made repeal of the regulation a top priority.\n\nAn early effort to revoke the regulation hit a snag in May when Senators John McCain of Arizona, Susan Collins of Maine and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, all Republicans, voted against a Senate resolution that would have eliminated it. The lawmakers said they were concerned that the resolution would have made regulating methane waste more difficult in the future.\n\nThe Interior Department then twice tried to suspend the regulation, an effort that is still being challenged in court.\n\nWestern lawmakers on Monday cheered the repeal, saying the rule would have discouraged energy production and job growth. \u201cThe previous administration scorned domestic energy development and crafted the prior rule to deliberately stifle it,\u201d said Representative Rob Bishop, a Utah Republican who chairs the House Committee on Natural Resources. He called the repeal \u201ca necessary step.\u201d\n\nEnvironmental activists denounced the plan and noted that the repeal would return the Bureau of Land Management to a set of policies dealing with methane waste that are almost 40 years old. \u201cGutting the rule would allow unchecked waste of natural gas, unnecessary pollution and the loss of revenue to communities and tribes to address critical needs such as schools and roads,\u201d said Fred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund.\n\nThe agency is expected to publish the proposal in the Federal Register, which will kick off a 60-day public comment period. A final repeal of the rule would come after that.\n\nLisa Friedman reports on climate and environmental policy in Washington.

He has also refused to allow the committee to vote on three subpoenas proposed by Democrats, including one on interim clearances.\n\nMr. Gowdy\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn a letter sent last week, Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the top Democrat on the committee, pressed Mr. Gowdy to more aggressively tackle the security clearance issue, saying that news of Mr. Porter\u2019s problems had given the matter renewed urgency.\n\n\u201cIf you had agreed to any of our previous requests for information on these matters, the White House would have been required to answer key questions about why Mr. Porter was denied a final security clearance,\u201d Mr. Cummings wrote.\n\n\u201cInstead, because of your multiple refusals, we did not find out about any of these issues until they were reported in the press,\u201d he added.\n\nThe process for allowing White House officials to work with secret, classified material typically begins when West Wing employees are subjected to a brief background check and are granted interim clearance. A full background check by the F.B.I. and, in some cases, the C.I.A. then begins.\n\nOfficials with previous administrations said it is not uncommon for the full background checks to take as long as eight months or a year, in part because of a long backlog in vetting the backgrounds of people needing clearance across the federal government.\n\nVideo\n\nBackground checks take about a year for Pentagon employees and six to seven months for prospective C.I.A. or National Security Agency workers, a senior American official said.\n\nBut several former White House officials said it is also common for administration officials to encourage the investigators to give top priority to senior presidential aides like Mr. Porter and Mr. Kushner.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhat Mr. McGahn and other top White House officials learned about the allegations against Mr. Porter, and when they learned it, remains murky.\n\nMr. Porter told Mr. McGahn in January 2017 that there could be what he described as false allegations against him, according to two people briefed on the situation. In June, the F.B.I. informed the White House security office that allegations of domestic abuse had surfaced. Mr. McGahn was made aware at the time that there was an issue with Mr. Porter\u2019s background investigation, but relied on the security office to continue pursuing the background check.\n\nWhite House officials disputed that assertion, saying on Monday that Mr. McGahn was not made aware during the summer of any problems with Mr. Porter\u2019s clearance.\n\nIn November, the bureau delivered a thick file on Mr. Porter\u2019s background check to the security office and relayed that he was not likely to succeed in getting a permanent clearance, according to one person briefed on the case. Security office officials encouraged the F.B.I. to complete its investigation so the office could make a final determination on Mr. Porter\u2019s clearance.\n\nOne person briefed on the situation, who had insisted on anonymity to discuss private deliberations, said late last week that the bureau had informed Mr. McGahn when the file was delivered that the allegations against Mr. Porter were likely to derail his security clearance. But on Monday, the person said that he had been mistaken, and contended that Mr. McGahn had not learned of the F.B.I.\u2019s communications to the security office until much later.\n\nIn Mr. Kushner\u2019s case, a final decision about a permanent security clearance is also still pending.\n\nMr. Lowell said that it should not be surprising that someone with \u201cthe extent of his holdings, travels and lengthy submissions\u201d would require a lengthy background check. But he took issue with the suggestion that the delays somehow affect Mr. Kushner\u2019s ability to do his job at the White House.\n\n\u201cThis is just the latest,\u201d he said, \u201cin unnamed sources quoting secondhand hearsay concerning Mr. Kushner that, like the others, will be shown to be untrue.\u201d", "keywords": ["porter", "mcgahn", "background", "clearances", "mr", "office", "white", "house", "attention", "aide", "clearance", "security", "renew", "accusations", "process"], "polarity": 0.05131168831168833, "subjectivity": 0.37775324675324673},

Another 1.1 million young immigrants are eligible for DACA but did not apply. But Mr. Trump suspended the initiative in September and gave lawmakers until March 5 to come up with a replacement that would protect the young immigrants, known as Dreamers, after proposed legislation called the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors, or DREAM Act.\n\nLiberal interest groups and immigration rights activists have mobilized to insist on legal status for the Dreamers without the concessions demanded by the president and immigration hard-liners: billions for a wall on the Mexican border, an even more aggressive crackdown on illegal immigrants and dramatic changes to the legal immigration system that would favor skilled immigrants over the family members of citizens and green-card holders.\n\n\u201cAs the Senate is poised to start debate on the humanitarian crisis Donald Trump caused when he cruelly ended DACA, here\u2019s what every sitting Senator should remember: Americans want the Dream Act \u2014 not cruel deals that go against basic American values,\u201d said Corinne Ball, campaign director for MoveOn.org, a liberal activist group.\n\nConservatives and anti-immigration groups are just as vociferous.\n\n\u201cIt was President Obama who created a cruel situation by making promises to a group of illegal aliens who he had no authority to promise what he gave them,\u201d said Rosemary Jenks, the director of government relations for NumbersUSA, a group that advocates limiting immigration. \u201cPresident Trump had a duty to rescind that policy, because the Constitution makes very clear that Congress, not the White House, sets the laws in this land.\u201d\n\nIn such a polarized environment, there is a significant chance that the Senate will pass nothing by the end of the week \u2014 or that whatever measure the Senate does adopt will be thwarted by the House.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have something in the Senate that we haven\u2019t had in a while,\u201d Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, said Sunday on the NBC program \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a real debate on an issue where we really don\u2019t know what the outcome is going to be.\u201d\n\nVideo\n\nImmigration is one of the most emotional, contentious issues in Washington.

A number of Republican senators, led by Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, have drafted legislation that mirrors the White House plan, which will almost certainly be introduced as an amendment.

Be Skeptical. For its forecast to come true would require productivity improvements not seen in decades and an atypical policy on interest rates.\n\nPresident Trump has been nothing if not bold in his promises to generate supercharged economic growth.\n\nWhen a report showed a strong 3.3 percent growth rate last fall, he said, \u201cI see no reason why we don\u2019t go to 4 percent, 5 percent, and even 6 percent,\u201d and he has spoken wistfully of emerging economies where growth can reach higher than that.\n\nEven if you treat those musings as presidential bombast, his administration is making detailed projections that the economy will expand much faster in the decade ahead than it has in recent years \u2014 a forecast that underpins the Trump policy agenda.\n\nThe administration forecasts growth in the neighborhood of 3 percent through the next decade, compared with around 2 percent projected by private forecasters and the economists at the Congressional Budget Office and the Federal Reserve. If the administration\u2019s forecast comes true, it will imply an economy 12 percent bigger in 2028 than that projected by the more cautious forecasts \u2014 an extra $2.8 trillion in economic activity that year, in today\u2019s dollars.\n\nBut when you look closely at the details of the forecast, not all of it quite adds up. To come true, it would require some of the strongest improvements in productivity seen in decades, yet also require that interest rates not react the way they have historically when growth strengthens.\n\nTo understand some of the Trump administration\u2019s buoyant assumptions and the apparent contradictions buried within them, it helps to go step by step on where economic growth comes from and how it relates to interest rates, employment and inflation.\n\nCapital spending can fuel higher growth, but not forever\n\nThink of the simplest arithmetic on how a single company can produce more goods and services. There are three ways:\n\nWorkers can put in more hours of labor. If the company hires more people, or has current workers do longer shifts, it can increase production.\n\nThe business can invest in more capital to make workers more effective. The latest equipment or software can mean each hour of labor creates more stuff.\n\nThe business can adjust its management techniques and how it operates to try to get more productivity out of the same workers and equipment.\n\nThe same idea applies to the economy as a whole. Growth comes from either more hours being worked, or more capital for each worker, or the third, which is called \u201ctotal factor productivity.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration leans heavily on the second of these \u2014 more capital \u2014 as justification for its optimism. With lower taxes on business, as well as regulatory policies that are more favorable to capital, the budget statement says, it will unleash \u201cgrowth-enhancing policies\u201d in terms of more capital in the economy per worker.\n\nIt is indeed plausible that these policies will encourage more capital investment in the next few years, said Joel Prakken, chief U.S. economist at Macroeconomic Advisers, with higher productivity growth as a consequence.\n\nBut that should be a one-time adjustment, after businesses increase their capital stock in response to more favorable policies. Once that process is complete and has resulted in higher productivity, there\u2019s no reason to think that capital investment would keep rising as a share of the economy.\n\nIn other words, the benefits in terms of productivity growth and economic growth should fade over time, which the administration acknowledges.\n\n\u201cThe new tax law would be a one-time shift, spread out over several years, after which there would be a new steady state growth path for labor productivity,\u201d DJ Nordquist, chief of staff at the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said in an email. \u201cNevertheless, in that new steady state, faster growth than we have seen in recent years can still be expected because of the elimination of excessive regulations, to which this administration is committed and because of our infrastructure plan. This deregulation will have enduring benefits to the rate of growth.\u201d\n\nSome private economists are not persuaded these effects are powerful enough to account for continued strong growth a decade from now. \u201cI try to fit these numbers into a mainstream paradigm and I can\u2019t make them fit,\u201d Mr. Prakken said.\n\nWhat about other sources of growth?\n\nBut even if higher capital investment can\u2019t do all the lifting of generating 3 percent growth, there remain those other two possibilities, of hours worked or total factor productivity, that could help achieve the 3 percent growth forecast even after the lift from tax cuts and capital investment fades.\n\nBut demographic trends are putting a lid on potential growth from more hours of work. The retirement of the baby boomers and stabilization of the proportion of women in the work force mean that potential hours worked will rise only 0.4 percent a year in the coming decade, according to the C.B.O.\u2019s forecast (compared with 1.3 percent a year from 1950 to 2016).\n\nMoreover, the Trump administration\u2019s immigration policies, if anything, would tilt that number in a negative direction, as deportations, tighter border security and more restrictive issuance of work visas reduces the potential supply of labor.\n\nMs. Nordquist argued that Trump administration policies would help increase the labor force, and hence growth potential.\n\n\u201cWe think that labor force participation has dropped in the past decade in part because of government policies that discourage work,\u201d said Ms. Norquist, including growth in Social Security disability insurance and the Affordable Care Act. \u201cThere is much room for the Trump administration to improve on those policies, for example through marginal individual income tax rate cuts,\u201d citing evidence that older, near-retirement workers may be more likely to work when taxes are lower.\n\nThen there\u2019s total factor productivity, the black-box driver of growth. Economists don\u2019t really understand it, and calculate it only as a residual \u2014 it is the number left over after calculating how much a rise in output comes from more hours worked or more capital.\n\nIt would be great for the long-term prospects for the economy \u2014 and for the Trump administration\u2019s forecast \u2014 if total factor productivity started rising faster. But it\u2019s hard to predict, and it doesn\u2019t show much relationship with either corporate taxes or government regulation. For example, it was quite high from 1950 to 1973, when corporate income taxes were between 48 and 52 percent (they were recently cut to 21 percent). And it was quite low from 1982 to 1990, amid the Reagan era tax cuts and deregulation.\n\nThe interest rate paradox\n\nSuppose the Trump administration\u2019s growth forecast really does materialize: Tax cuts and deregulation fuel productivity-enhancing capital spending; some good fortune arises in terms of the labor force and total factor productivity; and economic growth returns to its pre-2000 norm of around 3 percent. That would be positive news for the economy. But it also would be likely to have other effects, particularly on interest rates.\n\nOver time, interest rates tend to move in tandem with the nominal growth rate. Part of the reason interest rates have fallen sharply in the last decade is that low growth has translated into what economists call a low \u201cnatural rate\u201d of interest and low inflation levels.\n\nBut the Trump administration projects similar interest rates to those envisioned by more cautious forecasters, despite projecting higher growth.\n\nIt implies something of an immaculate expansion: returning to pre-2000 growth rates without also returning to pre-2000 interest rates.\n\nIn the 1990s, for example, G.D.P. growth averaged 3.3 percent per year, and the 10-year Treasury bond yield averaged 6.7 percent. The administration projects economic growth nearly that strong, but rates peaking at 3.7 percent.\n\nEven some who are on board with more optimistic forecasts of growth say that higher interest rates and inflation are likely to accompany it. Allen Sinai, a longtime forecaster, shares the administration\u2019s view that businesses will invest in more capital because of the tax law, thus achieving higher productivity.\n\nBut in addition to that, he argues, the economy will be at risk of overheating. He sees inflation rising to between 2.5 percent and 3 percent by late 2019, which could send long-term Treasury bond yields up to 5 percent, well above the 2.9 percent today and the 3.1 percent the administration forecasts for 2019.\n\n\u201cAt some point inflation gets high enough, and the market takes interest rates up,\u201d said Mr. Sinai, the chief economist at Decision Economics. And higher rates, it\u2019s worth adding, would raise the cost for the government to service the national debt, in turn making deficits higher.\n\nMs. Nordquist notes that the forecasts published Monday were developed in November, when interest rates were lower than they are now. \u201cIf we were to redo the interest rate forecast today, we would project higher rates,\u201d she said.\n\nThe art of the forecast\n\nHave some sympathy for those who build these forecasts. Predicting anything 10 years in advance is inherently hard, and no forecast is ever perfectly correct. As the last 10 years show, there is a lot that is just unknowable about the forces that will buffet the economy.\n\nBut you do want those forecasts to line up with what we already know about the economic and demographic forces that will shape the future. And a lot will have to go right for the Trump administration\u2019s forecasts to come true.\n\nCorrection : Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the gender of DJ Nordquist, the chief of staff of the White House Council of Economic Advisers.

He was responsible for paper flow to the president and was later involved in drafting President Trump\u2019s inaugural State of the Union address.\n\nMr. Porter told Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel, that he was concerned about his former wives coming forward with potentially damaging accusations.\n\nDespite that conversation, the White House granted Mr. Porter an interim security clearance to handle highly classified materials going to the president.\n\nF.B.I. agents interviewed Ms. Holderness and Ms. Willoughby as part of an investigation for Mr. Porter\u2019s security clearance in the White House, and both women discussed the domestic abuse allegations.

She said she was not aware that anyone at the security office disclosed in March to any official in the West Wing that there were problems with Mr. Porter\u2019s background check.\n\nApril 24\n\nMs. Willoughby published a blog post titled \u201cWhy I Stayed,\u201d in which she described an abusive marriage with Mr. Porter, but did not name him.

Mr. Wray did not disclose what the follow-up inquiry was, or who made it.\n\nPeople briefed on the situation said officials at the security office encouraged the F.B.I. to interview Mr. Porter before closing its background investigation.\n\nMs. Sanders said Tuesday that she was not aware that anyone in the White House security office contacted any senior official in the West Wing about Mr. Porter\u2019s background check issues in July.\n\nHowever, people briefed on the issue said Mr. McGahn was made aware at the time that there was an issue with Mr. Porter\u2019s background investigation. The White House disputed that assertion, saying that Mr. McGahn was unaware of any problem.\n\nMs. Sanders said Tuesday that the security office believed that the F.B.I. report in July \u201crequired significant additional investigatory fieldwork\u201d before security officials could decide whether to recommend a security clearance for Mr. Porter. They asked the F.B.I. to do more work on it, she said.\n\nSeptember\n\nAccording to Ms. Willoughby, White House officials informed Mr. Porter that his security clearance \u201chad not gone through,\u201d as she recalled him saying.

They said security office officials encouraged the F.B.I. to complete its investigation so the office could make a final decision on Mr. Porter\u2019s clearance.\n\nMs. Sanders said she was not aware that anyone in the security office communicated in November to any senior official in the West Wing about problems with Mr. Porter\u2019s background investigation.\n\nBut multiple people familiar with the situation have said top officials \u2014 including Mr. McGahn; John F. Kelly, the chief of staff; and Joe Hagin, the deputy chief of staff \u2014 learned in November that there were problems with Mr. Porter\u2019s background investigation.\n\nImage Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel.

The woman, who knew Mr. McGahn well, was upset because she had discovered that Mr. Porter was also dating Hope Hicks, the White House communications director. The people briefed on the conversation said the woman did not claim physical abuse, but told Mr. McGahn that he should not trust Mr. Porter.\n\nJanuary 2018\n\nMr. Porter\u2019s background check investigation was \u201cadministratively closed,\u201d Mr. Wray said during his testimony Tuesday, weeks before the allegations become public.

Hatch, the Utah Republican who once employed Mr. Porter as chief of staff, said in a statement that \u201cthe country needs more honest, principled people like Rob Porter, which is why I hope that this cynical campaign to discredit his character ultimately fails.\u201d\n\nMs. Sanders said Tuesday that the White House security office was still evaluating the results of Mr. Porter\u2019s background investigation, and had not yet come to a conclusion when the allegations against Mr. Porter were published.\n\nFeb. 7\n\nMr. Porter, despite the support from senior White House officials, announced his resignation. In a statement, he said that \u201cthese allegations are simply false,\u201d even as more details and photos said to be a result of the abuse circulated in a new interview published in The Intercept.\n\nMs. Sanders also issued a statement saying that both the president and Mr. Kelly had \u201cfull confidence\u201d in Mr. Porter\u2019s performance. Mr. Kelly released a new statement later that day, around 10 p.m., saying he had been unaware of the allegations against Mr. Porter.\n\nMr. Hatch, for his part, described himself as \u201cheartbroken\u201d by the new allegations.\n\nFeb. 8\n\nWhite House officials conceded regrets about how they handled the accusations against Mr. Porter. At a news briefing, Raj Shah, the deputy White House press secretary, told reporters that Mr. Kelly had not been aware of the allegations, and that the security clearance investigation into Mr. Porter\u2019s background had been continuing until his resignation.\n\n\u201cHis background investigation was ongoing,\u201d Mr. Shah told reporters. \u201cHe was operating on an interim security clearance. His clearance was never denied, and he resigned.\u201d\n\nImage Raj Shah, the deputy White House press secretary, was asked on Thursday about the allegations against Mr. Porter. Credit Tom Brenner/The New York Times\n\nMr. Kelly told staff members that he had learned the details of Mr. Porter\u2019s situation only \u201c40 minutes before he threw him out\u201d two days earlier. In a memo sent that night, Mr. Kelly wrote: \u201cWhile we are all processing the shocking and troubling allegations made against a former White House staffer, I want you to know that we all take matters of domestic violence very seriously. Domestic violence is abhorrent and has no place in our society.\u201d\n\nFeb. 9\n\nMr. Trump acknowledged the accusations facing Mr. Porter, saying that it was a \u201ctough time\u201d for his former aide. The president added, \u201cHe also, as you probably know, says he is innocent, and I think you have to remember that.\u201d Mr. Kelly also told White House officials that he was willing to step down over his handling of the allegations.\n\nThat evening, the White House announced that Derek Lyons, another lawyer educated at Harvard Law School and Mr. Porter\u2019s No. 2, had been elevated to acting staff secretary.\n\nFeb. 11\n\nA day after Mr. Trump complained that a \u201cmere allegation\u201d could ruin someone without due process, White House aides fanned out to talk shows to say that Mr. Porter had lied to them and deserved to be pushed out.\n\nFeb. 13\n\nWhile testifying in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mr. Wray, the F.B.I. director, contradicted the White House timeline and confirmed for the first time that the bureau had given the White House a partial report on problems in Mr. Porter\u2019s background in March. He also said the bureau had closed its investigation in January, though the White House had insisted that it was still continuing well into February.\n\nMaggie Haberman contributed reporting from New York.\n\nMichael D.

The senator has avoided any criticism of Mr. Trump in recent weeks and on Monday met with Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s daughter.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s political advisers, getting wind of the meeting, scrambled to brief Ms. Trump and her own staff about Mr. Corker\u2019s renewed interest in running again and his desire for the president\u2019s support, according to a Republican official. An aide to Mr. Corker said Ms. Trump requested the meeting.\n\nMore broadly, Mr. Corker\u2019s advisers say he and Mr. Trump have patched up their relationship and the senator is simply hearing out those who would like him to remain in the Senate, a decision he technically does not have to make until Tennessee\u2019s filing deadline in early April.\n\n\u201cIn recent days, people across Tennessee have reached out to Senator Corker with concerns about the outcome of this election because they believe it could determine control of the Senate and the future of our agenda,\u201d said Micah Johnson, Mr. Corker\u2019s spokeswoman.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Corker is not the only Republican who could shake up a closely watched Senate race.

And that he might consider a reconciliation with a senator who only a few months ago portrayed him as an unruly toddler underscores that there are no permanent friends or enemies to Mr. Trump.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

That would raise a delicate issue for a Senate Republican caucus that includes just five women in its ranks.\n\n\u201cAnyone who thinks Marsha Blackburn can\u2019t win a general election is just a plain sexist pig,\u201d said Andrea Bozek, a spokeswoman for Ms. Blackburn, adding, \u201cWe aren\u2019t worried about these ego-driven, tired old men.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat is an unmistakable reference to a bloc of establishment-aligned Tennessee Republicans who believe Ms. Blackburn\u2019s conservative politics and hard-charging style may turn off some voters and make her vulnerable against the centrist and low-key Mr. Bredesen.\n\nTom Ingram, a Republican strategist and a longtime friend of Mr. Corker\u2019s, argued that Republicans could imperil the seat and their one-seat majority if they do not rally around an incumbent who has already won the state twice.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a dicey race with an unproven statewide candidate against Phil Bredesen,\u201d Mr. Ingram said. \u201cIf Corker is the nominee, it\u2019s not in play.\u201d\n\nFueling the anxieties of some Tennessee Republicans is the openness some in the party\u2019s donor wing have toward backing Mr. Bredesen. Concerns about such defections cropped up again this week when an invitation to a $5,400-per-couple Bredesen fund-raiser hosted by the widow of the former Nashville Republican powerhouse Ted Welch began circulating among Republicans.\n\nSuch talk induces eye-rolling among a younger generation of Republicans in Tennessee.\n\n\u201cEvery Republican in Tennessee outside the walls of the Belle Meade Country Club believes Marsha is a heavy favorite against anybody who might get in that primary,\u201d said Brad Todd, a Republican consultant raised in the state who is not aligned in the Senate race.", "keywords": ["corker", "trump", "ms", "retirement", "reconsiders", "mr", "senator", "win", "republican", "senate", "race", "blackburn", "republicans"], "polarity": 0.09856032125768967, "subjectivity": 0.43792506835269984},

But Mr. Schumer objected, on the grounds that such a measure is unrelated to DACA.

That\u2019s not optimal. But it\u2019s better than letting it die.\u201d\n\nImmigration is one of the most difficult and contentious issues to come before Congress. The last time the Senate debated immigration, in 2013, the matter was on the floor for weeks.

But the proposal, drafted by a group of Republicans led by Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, does not appear to have garnered the backing of 60 senators.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOther proposals are also floating around the Capitol, including a \u201cskinny bill\u201d or \u201ctwo-pillar bill\u201d that would pair an extension of the DACA program with money for border security.

Mr. Trump\u2019s budget assumes that effort will now succeed, somehow. Party leaders have downplayed suggestions floated by Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, among others, that Congress could move this year to reduce future spending on safety net programs such as Medicare and Social Security.\n\n\u201cRepublicans will still tell you that runaway spending hurts the economy,\u201d said Brian Riedl, a senior fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute who is a former chief economist for Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio. But the party, he said, \u201cisn\u2019t even talking about Social Security and Medicare reform anymore. And that to me is the sea change.

Mr. Trump has regularly dangled the possibility of quitting the North American Free Trade Agreement, for example, and his signature tax law sets all of its individual cuts, and a key business provision, to expire in a few years.\n\nDemocrats look at that evolution and see Republicans revealing a new set of economic preferences for the Trump era: lower taxes, less regulation, more federal spending \u2014 including an infrastructure proposal that could further swell the deficit \u2014 and mounting piles of federal debt.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Bush \u2014 the very policies that conservatives blamed for their party losing its way, and control of Congress, in 2006.\n\n\u201cOn certainty, smaller deficits and less government spending, I do see shifts,\u201d said Michael R. Strain, an economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think those shifts are as significant as many are making them out to be. George W. Bush inherited a budget surplus and left large deficits. He expanded Medicare without paying for it. Dick Cheney said \u2018deficits don\u2019t matter.\u2019 Reagan said that the deficit is big enough to take care of itself. The G.O.P. has not restrained federal spending when it has held the White House.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe official line, from the White House to congressional leadership, is that Republicans remain committed to spending restraint, but have been forced by Democrats to cut deals that run up more spending. That is their rationale for last week\u2019s agreement to lift Obama-era restraints on defense and nondefense discretionary spending by $300 billion, in order to secure the defense spending increases that conservatives say are crucial to national security. (Many also contend that the new tax law will generate enough growth to offset any lost federal revenues, although no detailed independent analysis supports that claim.)\n\nSome leading conservative economists say the party has not lost its core convictions on spending and debt, which, they contend, remain solely a problem of rising safety net spending in the years to come as the population ages and the Baby Boom generation retires from the work force.\n\n\u201cI think their view all along has been that spending and debt are not immediate threats to growth,\u201d said John H. Cochrane, an economist who is a senior fellow at Stanford University\u2019s Hoover Institution. \u201cThey know that right now, a fundamental reform of entitlements won\u2019t happen. So, they have avoided weekly chaos and gotten needed military spending through by opening the spending bill, and they got an important reduction in growth-distorting marginal corporate rates through by accepting a bit more deficits. They know that can\u2019t be the end of the story.\u201d\n\nMr. Cochrane likened the economic threat of rising spending and debt to living on an earthquake fault, poised to rumble at any moment. He said those risks may be making markets \u201cjittery\u201d, and that Republicans may be running out of time to follow through on their convictions, but he expressed hope that Republicans and Democrats might find a way to work together to reduce future spending growth.\n\nRepublicans declined to make such an agreement under Mr. Obama, who was willing to reduce Social Security spending but wanted to increase taxes as part of a deal. They seem unlikely to make that gamble now under Mr. Trump, who, many conservative economists note, promised in his campaign not to touch Social Security or Medicare, and whose actions during last year\u2019s Obamacare repeal debate left some Republican leaders feeling scarred.\n\n\u201cWhen push came to shove last year, he described entitlement reforms as \u2018mean,\u2019 and completely cut their legs out from under them,\u201d said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, an economist who advised President Bush and is now president of the conservative American Action Forum. \u201cSo where do they go from there, with any confidence?\u201d\n\nThe president continues to send mixed signals. On the first page of his budget released Monday, he warned that \u201cthe current fiscal path is unsustainable, and future generations deserve better.\u201d But late last month, in his State of the Union address, deficits and debt were not at the top of Mr. Trump\u2019s mind.

Credit Brynn Anderson/Associated Press\n\nHow easy is it to change people\u2019s votes in an election?\n\nThe answer, a growing number of studies conclude, is that most forms of political persuasion seem to have little effect at all.\n\nThis conclusion may sound jarring at a time when people are concerned about the effects of the false news articles that flooded Facebook and other online outlets during the 2016 election. Observers speculated that these so-called fake news articles swung the election to Donald J. Trump. Similar suggestions of large persuasion effects, supposedly pushing Mr. Trump to victory, have been made about online advertising from the firm Cambridge Analytica and content promoted by Russian bots.\n\nMuch more remains to be learned about the effects of these types of online activities, but people should not assume they had huge effects. Previous studies have found, for instance, that the effects of even television advertising (arguably a higher-impact medium) are very small. According to one credible estimate, the net effect of exposure to an additional ad shifts the partisan vote of approximately two people out of 10,000.\n\nIn fact, a recent meta-analysis of numerous different forms of campaign persuasion, including in-person canvassing and mail, finds that their average effect in general elections is zero.\n\nField experiments testing the effects of online ads on political candidates and issues have also found null effects. We shouldn\u2019t be surprised \u2014 it\u2019s hard to change people\u2019s minds! Their votes are shaped by fundamental factors like which party they typically support and how they view the state of the economy. \u201cFake news\u201d and bots are likely to have vastly smaller effects, especially given how polarized our politics have become.\n\nHere\u2019s what you should look for in evaluating claims about vast persuasion effects from dubious online content:\n\nHow many people actually saw the questionable material. Many alarming statistics have been produced since the election about how many times \u201cfake news\u201d was shared on Facebook or how many times Russian bots retweeted content on Twitter. These statistics obscure the fact that the content being shared may not reach many Americans (most people are not on Twitter and consume relatively little political news) or even many humans (many bot followers may themselves be bots).\n\nWhether the people being exposed are persuadable. Dubious political content online is disproportionately likely to reach heavy news consumers who already have strong opinions. For instance, a study I conducted with Andrew Guess of Princeton and Jason Reifler of the University of Exeter in Britain showed that exposure to fake news websites before the 2016 election was heavily concentrated among the 10 percent of Americans with the most conservative information diets \u2014 not exactly swing voters.\n\nThe proportion of news people saw that is bogus. The total number of shares or likes that fake news and bots attract can sound enormous until you consider how much information circulates online. Twitter, for instance, reported that Russian bots tweeted 2.1 million times before the election \u2014 certainly a worrisome number. But these represented only 1 percent of all election-related tweets and 0.5 percent of views of election-related tweets.\n\nSimilarly, my study with Mr. Guess and Mr. Reifler found that the mean number of articles on fake news websites visited by Trump supporters was 13.1, but only 40 percent of his supporters visited such websites, and they represented only about 6 percent of the pages they visited on sites focusing on news topics.\n\nNone of these findings indicate that fake news and bots aren\u2019t worrisome signs for American democracy. They can mislead and polarize citizens, undermine trust in the media, and distort the content of public debate. But those who want to combat online misinformation should take steps based on evidence and data, not hype or speculation.\n\nBrendan Nyhan is a professor of government at Dartmouth College.

Mr. Trump ended the program in September, giving lawmakers until March 5 to agree on a replacement so that about 700,000 young immigrants are not deported. That deadline, however, is not as firm as the president suggests.

As of now, there are no plans to cancel or further delay joint military exercises by the United States and South Korea, scheduled for after the Olympic Games.\n\nStill, the tactical shift by the White House opens the door to an unpredictable new phase in the crisis over North Korea. It also shows how the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, has been able to use the Olympics to pursue a thaw with a receptive counterpart in the South.\n\nPresident Trump himself has oscillated between a get-tough approach and a deal maker\u2019s belief that he can sit down with Mr. Kim and work out an agreement. Some of his advisers, like Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, favor engagement; others, like the national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, have pushed for more pressure, backed by the threat of military action.\n\nReports that Washington and Seoul had reached an understanding on the possibility of dialogue appeared in the news media after the vice president\u2019s departure on Saturday, but South Korean officials would not confirm them until Tuesday.\n\nDialogue with the North has been used by successive American administrations as a carrot \u2014 paired with the stick of sanctions \u2014 in the hopes of getting the isolated nation to end its nuclear weapons program. But the Trump administration has long resisted that approach, saying it would not be drawn into a negotiation like that of the Clinton administration in 1994, which resulted in a deal North Korea later broke.\n\nJust six months ago, Mr. Trump described Mr. Moon\u2019s overtures to the North as \u201cappeasement.\u201d When Mr. Tillerson said in December that the United States was willing to hold a \u201cmeeting without precondition,\u201d the White House dismissed his comments as premature.\n\nBut in an interview with The Washington Post after he left South Korea, Mr. Pence suggested that the United States was open to a meeting, even indicating that it would enter talks without preconditions. \u201cThe maximum pressure campaign is going to continue and intensify,\u201d Mr. Pence said of the punishing sanctions imposed on the North by the United Nations. \u201cBut if you want to talk, we\u2019ll talk.\u201d\n\nAgreeing to talks before the North Koreans have demonstrated a willingness to dismantle their weapons program would be a subtle but potentially significant shift in Washington\u2019s approach \u2014 and a win for Mr. Moon.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen Mr. Pence and Mr. Moon met last week, the allies apparently found common ground: They would agree to talks without set rules, but they would continue to use sanctions as leverage.\n\n\u201cPresident Moon and I reflected last night on the need to do something fundamentally different,\u201d Mr. Pence told reporters on Friday after meeting with the South Korean leader.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

She extended an invitation from her brother to Mr. Moon for a summit meeting in North Korea.\n\nMr. Moon, who invited athletes from the North to participate in the Olympics \u2014 where they marched with South Korean athletes under a unified Korean flag during the opening ceremony \u2014 has seen the Games as an important step toward promoting peace on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nDeciphering the Trump administration\u2019s signals on North Korea is tricky, given the president\u2019s unpredictability. Mr. Trump has repeatedly contradicted Mr. Tillerson when he has floated diplomatic openings. But Mr. Pence, officials point out, received his marching orders from Mr. Trump shortly before he left for Asia, and he was unlikely to deviate from them.\n\nThe White House has been relieved by the lull in North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile tests, even as it has watched the emerging d\u00e9tente warily. North Korea has not conducted any major weapons tests since Nov. 29, when it launched an intercontinental ballistic missile powerful enough to reach the mainland United States.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEven if talks start between North Korea and the United States, the gap between the countries remains wide. Analysts predicted that North Korea would use any future talks with Washington to be accepted as a nuclear power and win large economic concessions, in return for agreeing not to advance its nuclear weapons program any further.\n\nNorth Korea has said that it would not bargain away its weapons, and would only discuss mutual arms reduction \u2014 a vow that American intelligence agencies take seriously. The C.I.A. has assessed that no amount of pressure will lead Mr. Kim to give up his arsenal.\n\nIn testimony before the Senate on Tuesday, the director of national intelligence, Dan Coats, said, North Korea \u201chas repeatedly stated that it does not intend to negotiate its nuclear weapons and missiles away because the regime views nuclear weapons are critical to its security.\u201d\n\nMr. Kim, he added, \u201cprobably sees nuclear ICBMs as leverage to achieve his long-term strategic ambition to end Seoul\u2019s alliance with Washington and to eventually dominate the peninsula.\u201d", "keywords": ["trump", "north", "nuclear", "united", "korean", "weapons", "mr", "korea", "victory", "opens", "door", "talks", "south", "president", "pence", "souths"], "polarity": 0.06763167388167388, "subjectivity": 0.39230171169826333},

Of 12 positions deemed most central to the president, only five are still filled by the same person as when Mr. Trump took office.\n\nMr. Trump is on his second press secretary, his second national security adviser and his third deputy national security adviser. Five different people have been named communications director or served in the job in an acting capacity. The president has parted ways with his chief strategist, health secretary, several deputy chiefs of staff and his original private legal team. He is on his second chief of staff \u2014 and some wonder whether a third may be in the offing soon.\n\nSome administration officials privately spend much of their time trying to figure out how to leave without looking disloyal or provoking an easily angered president. Others, like Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, stubbornly resist what seem like clear signals that they are no longer welcome.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still here,\u201d Mr. Tillerson told Fox News last week, months after the White House was reported in The New York Times and elsewhere to have a plan to replace him. \u201cNothing has changed.\u201d Asked if he thought some in the administration were still advocating that he be replaced, Mr. Tillerson said, \u201cI have no idea.\u201d\n\nGrueling in the best of times, an administration job now seems even less appealing to many potential recruits. Republican operatives said they worry not only about the pressure-cooker, soap-opera atmosphere and the danger of being drawn into the special counsel investigation of Russia\u2019s election interference but also about hurting their careers after the White House.\n\nVideo\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t a huge appetite from many Republicans on the outside to explore job opportunities in this administration,\u201d said Ryan Williams, a former spokesman for Mitt Romney, the party\u2019s 2012 presidential nominee. \u201cWhile there are a lot of vacancies and usually a position in the White House is one of the most prestigious jobs in Washington, that\u2019s just not the feeling with this administration, given the turmoil and the chaos.\u201d\n\nJohn F. Kelly was charged with reining in the turmoil and the chaos when he took over as chief of staff last summer, and many credit him with imposing more order on the building and shuffling out some of the more quarrelsome figures. But many White House officials were already souring on Mr. Kelly even before his handling of the abuse allegations against Mr. Porter gave his internal critics new ammunition against him.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Trump has expressed frustration with Mr. Kelly as well, but has sent mixed signals about whether he might replace him.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Omarosa Manigault Newman, a former contestant on Mr. Trump\u2019s reality TV show \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d who worked in the White House until Mr. Kelly pushed her out in December, cried as she described her experiences during a new episode of \u201cThe Celebrity Big Brother\u201d that aired on CBS last week.\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019m there fighting, fighting, fighting, getting my head bashed in, and nobody coming out publicly to say, \u2018We support her,\u2019\u201d she told a fellow competitor. Asked if the nation would be O.K., she said, \u201cNo, it\u2019s going to not be O.K. It\u2019s not.\u201d She added that she would not vote for Mr. Trump again \u201cin a million years, never.\u201d\n\nBeyond those leaving, many positions have never been filled nearly 13 months after the inauguration. Some of those vacancies stem from the glacial pace of background investigations and the Senate confirmation process, which has grown worse with each successive president. But in many cases, the Trump administration has still not identified candidates.\n\nAccording to the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit organization that tracks appointments along with The Washington Post, the Trump administration has made the fewest nominations, not counting those that have failed, and has had the fewest confirmed by this point of any of the last five administrations. At the State Department, nominees have yet to be made for three under secretary positions and 10 assistant secretary positions, senior-level jobs that have traditionally been crucial to managing foreign policy.\n\nNow in its second year, the president\u2019s team is trying to get ahead of the situation. The White House on Friday released a raft of appointments. But a vast majority of the 32 announced were actually just promotions from within, or additional titles for existing staff members.\n\nThe top two appointments on the list were James Carroll as acting national drug policy director and John DeStefano as counselor to the president, both choices that underlined the challenges for the White House.\n\nFor Mr. Carroll, it will be his fourth job in the White House since the administration\u2019s inception; he started in the White House counsel\u2019s office, then became general counsel for the budget office and served most recently as deputy chief of staff. For Mr. DeStefano, the new title was a recognition that he has already effectively been overseeing the offices of personnel, political affairs and public liaison.\n\nThe constant churning exacts a toll. \u201cIt takes time for any group to jell and learn the ropes of governing, and that is definitely complicated by turnover,\u201d said Lisa Brown, a top White House official under Mr. Obama and President Bill Clinton. \u201cEvery new person has to learn the ropes and changes the team dynamic.

Credit Andrew Cullen/Reuters\n\nThe Trump administration on Monday moved to repeal one of the last unchallenged climate-change regulations rushed into place in the waning days of the Obama presidency \u2014 a rule restricting the release of planet-warming methane into the atmosphere.\n\nThe rule, which applied to companies drilling for energy on federal land, has been the subject of intense court battles and delay efforts, as well as one surprise vote last year in which Senate Republicans temporarily saved it from being torpedoed.\n\nMethane, which is about 25 times more potent at trapping heat than carbon dioxide, accounts for 9 percent of all domestic greenhouse gas emissions; about a third of that is estimated to come from oil and gas operations. Under the rule, oil and gas companies would have been required to capture leaked methane, update their equipment and write new plans for minimizing waste when drilling on government property.\n\nThe Interior Department\u2019s Bureau of Land Management described the rule as costly, redundant and overly burdensome.\n\n\u201cIn order to achieve energy dominance through responsible energy production, we need smart regulations, not punitive regulations,\u201d Joe Balash, the department\u2019s assistant secretary for land and minerals management, said Monday in a statement .\n\nThe move came as the Trump administration released an $11.3 billion budget for the Interior Department that emphasized the development of domestic energy resources and \u201cresponsible development of energy on public lands and offshore waters.\u201d\n\nThe methane waste rule was aimed at accidental gas leaks and the process of venting and burning off leaked gas, known as flaring, from oil and gas wells on public lands. It was created as part of a broad strategy to tackle climate change as well as wasteful releases of gas. The Bureau of Land Management estimated in 2016 that the rule would prevent as much as 180,000 tons of methane emissions annually, about the equivalent of taking 950,000 cars off the road.\n\nThe oil and gas industry argued that the rule could cost as much as $279 million to implement and would hinder production. The industry made repeal of the regulation a top priority.\n\nAn early effort to revoke the regulation hit a snag in May when Senators John McCain of Arizona, Susan Collins of Maine and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, all Republicans, voted against a Senate resolution that would have eliminated it. The lawmakers said they were concerned that the resolution would have made regulating methane waste more difficult in the future.\n\nThe Interior Department then twice tried to suspend the regulation, an effort that is still being challenged in court.\n\nWestern lawmakers on Monday cheered the repeal, saying the rule would have discouraged energy production and job growth. \u201cThe previous administration scorned domestic energy development and crafted the prior rule to deliberately stifle it,\u201d said Representative Rob Bishop, a Utah Republican who chairs the House Committee on Natural Resources. He called the repeal \u201ca necessary step.\u201d\n\nEnvironmental activists denounced the plan and noted that the repeal would return the Bureau of Land Management to a set of policies dealing with methane waste that are almost 40 years old. \u201cGutting the rule would allow unchecked waste of natural gas, unnecessary pollution and the loss of revenue to communities and tribes to address critical needs such as schools and roads,\u201d said Fred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund.\n\nThe agency is expected to publish the proposal in the Federal Register, which will kick off a 60-day public comment period. A final repeal of the rule would come after that.\n\nLisa Friedman reports on climate and environmental policy in Washington.

He has also refused to allow the committee to vote on three subpoenas proposed by Democrats, including one on interim clearances.\n\nMr. Gowdy\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn a letter sent last week, Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the top Democrat on the committee, pressed Mr. Gowdy to more aggressively tackle the security clearance issue, saying that news of Mr. Porter\u2019s problems had given the matter renewed urgency.\n\n\u201cIf you had agreed to any of our previous requests for information on these matters, the White House would have been required to answer key questions about why Mr. Porter was denied a final security clearance,\u201d Mr. Cummings wrote.\n\n\u201cInstead, because of your multiple refusals, we did not find out about any of these issues until they were reported in the press,\u201d he added.\n\nThe process for allowing White House officials to work with secret, classified material typically begins when West Wing employees are subjected to a brief background check and are granted interim clearance. A full background check by the F.B.I. and, in some cases, the C.I.A. then begins.\n\nOfficials with previous administrations said it is not uncommon for the full background checks to take as long as eight months or a year, in part because of a long backlog in vetting the backgrounds of people needing clearance across the federal government.\n\nVideo\n\nBackground checks take about a year for Pentagon employees and six to seven months for prospective C.I.A. or National Security Agency workers, a senior American official said.\n\nBut several former White House officials said it is also common for administration officials to encourage the investigators to give top priority to senior presidential aides like Mr. Porter and Mr. Kushner.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhat Mr. McGahn and other top White House officials learned about the allegations against Mr. Porter, and when they learned it, remains murky.\n\nMr. Porter told Mr. McGahn in January 2017 that there could be what he described as false allegations against him, according to two people briefed on the situation. In June, the F.B.I. informed the White House security office that allegations of domestic abuse had surfaced. Mr. McGahn was made aware at the time that there was an issue with Mr. Porter\u2019s background investigation, but relied on the security office to continue pursuing the background check.\n\nWhite House officials disputed that assertion, saying on Monday that Mr. McGahn was not made aware during the summer of any problems with Mr. Porter\u2019s clearance.\n\nIn November, the bureau delivered a thick file on Mr. Porter\u2019s background check to the security office and relayed that he was not likely to succeed in getting a permanent clearance, according to one person briefed on the case. Security office officials encouraged the F.B.I. to complete its investigation so the office could make a final determination on Mr. Porter\u2019s clearance.\n\nOne person briefed on the situation, who had insisted on anonymity to discuss private deliberations, said late last week that the bureau had informed Mr. McGahn when the file was delivered that the allegations against Mr. Porter were likely to derail his security clearance. But on Monday, the person said that he had been mistaken, and contended that Mr. McGahn had not learned of the F.B.I.\u2019s communications to the security office until much later.\n\nIn Mr. Kushner\u2019s case, a final decision about a permanent security clearance is also still pending.\n\nMr. Lowell said that it should not be surprising that someone with \u201cthe extent of his holdings, travels and lengthy submissions\u201d would require a lengthy background check. But he took issue with the suggestion that the delays somehow affect Mr. Kushner\u2019s ability to do his job at the White House.\n\n\u201cThis is just the latest,\u201d he said, \u201cin unnamed sources quoting secondhand hearsay concerning Mr. Kushner that, like the others, will be shown to be untrue.\u201d", "keywords": ["porter", "mcgahn", "background", "clearances", "mr", "office", "white", "house", "attention", "aide", "clearance", "security", "renew", "accusations", "process"], "polarity": 0.05131168831168833, "subjectivity": 0.37775324675324673},

Another 1.1 million young immigrants are eligible for DACA but did not apply. But Mr. Trump suspended the initiative in September and gave lawmakers until March 5 to come up with a replacement that would protect the young immigrants, known as Dreamers, after proposed legislation called the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors, or DREAM Act.\n\nLiberal interest groups and immigration rights activists have mobilized to insist on legal status for the Dreamers without the concessions demanded by the president and immigration hard-liners: billions for a wall on the Mexican border, an even more aggressive crackdown on illegal immigrants and dramatic changes to the legal immigration system that would favor skilled immigrants over the family members of citizens and green-card holders.\n\n\u201cAs the Senate is poised to start debate on the humanitarian crisis Donald Trump caused when he cruelly ended DACA, here\u2019s what every sitting Senator should remember: Americans want the Dream Act \u2014 not cruel deals that go against basic American values,\u201d said Corinne Ball, campaign director for MoveOn.org, a liberal activist group.\n\nConservatives and anti-immigration groups are just as vociferous.\n\n\u201cIt was President Obama who created a cruel situation by making promises to a group of illegal aliens who he had no authority to promise what he gave them,\u201d said Rosemary Jenks, the director of government relations for NumbersUSA, a group that advocates limiting immigration. \u201cPresident Trump had a duty to rescind that policy, because the Constitution makes very clear that Congress, not the White House, sets the laws in this land.\u201d\n\nIn such a polarized environment, there is a significant chance that the Senate will pass nothing by the end of the week \u2014 or that whatever measure the Senate does adopt will be thwarted by the House.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have something in the Senate that we haven\u2019t had in a while,\u201d Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, said Sunday on the NBC program \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a real debate on an issue where we really don\u2019t know what the outcome is going to be.\u201d\n\nVideo\n\nImmigration is one of the most emotional, contentious issues in Washington.

A number of Republican senators, led by Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, have drafted legislation that mirrors the White House plan, which will almost certainly be introduced as an amendment. Mr. McConnell said on Monday that he supported it.\n\nThe American people have \u201cheard many of my colleagues across the aisle insist this issue requires swift action,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cNow is the time to back up the talk with the hard work of finding a workable solution. That means finding an agreement that can pass the Senate, pass the House and which the president will sign \u2014 not just making a point.\u201d\n\nSeveral other proposals are floating around Capitol Hill, but so far none has garnered the backing of the White House. A bipartisan group calling itself the Common Sense Coalition, led by Senators Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, and Joe Manchin, Democrat of West Virginia, has been working on its own measure but has not released a plan.\n\nThat group is focused on a narrower bill than the president would like, one that would pair a path to citizenship for the Dreamers with funding for the border wall.\n\n\u201cThe only way to achieve a solution to the DACA crisis is to keep it simple,\u201d Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida and a member of the coalition, said on the Senate floor Monday.\n\nBut Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican, said he could not support a bill that addresses only DACA and border security. \u201cThe president\u2019s indicated he would not sign such a bill, so that really doesn\u2019t meet my definition of success,\u201d he said.\n\nAt the same time, the idea of an open-ended debate is so novel that many newer senators say they have never experienced one, and are scurrying to learn the rules.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cFor a lot of us, we\u2019re going to have to learn this process,\u201d said Senator Mike Rounds, Republican of South Dakota, who was elected in 2014.\n\nSenator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, marveled, \u201cBeen here seven years \u2014 I\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\u201d\n\nImmigrant rights groups are nervous, and do not know quite what to expect.

To some extent, there\u2019s always been an adversarial role between the White House and reporters. How do you feel about the tenor of things now? It used to be friendly-adversarial. There would be retaliation for stories they didn\u2019t like, but nothing compared with this. There\u2019s a war going on. For a president to come out with the term \u201cfake news\u201d \u2014 he\u2019s putting targets on our heads.

There is a veil on the White House; people want to look behind the curtain. It\u2019s their house. When you open up a press briefing to see the back and forth, you\u2019re getting more in the weeds of what\u2019s going on, beyond just the quote we may put in the story. This is a key piece that I don\u2019t think people really get: When you talk about the press, it\u2019s not about journalists; it\u2019s about the free-flowing information that the American public is supposed to get. When you bash the press, you\u2019re bashing the idea of getting truth out.\n\nWhat\u2019s the public opinion of the White House press corps? It depends on whom you talk to. We\u2019re so tribal now. There used to be a day when you didn\u2019t know the person\u2019s politics. The line has been obscured between facts and opinion. I think it started during the Clinton years, and it just kept getting progressively worse. People don\u2019t want to just hear the news; they want to hear what people have to say about it too.\n\nYour reactions during the televised briefings have generated memes. Has it made you more self-conscious? I\u2019m so sad about that. My boss has always said, \u201cYou need to know how to play poker.\u201d I don\u2019t. I\u2019m trying! The last time I was really caught off guard was when Sarah Huckabee Sanders said something about people\u2019s minds being in the gutter after President Trump\u2019s tweet about Kirsten Gillibrand. I really get into those briefings. I really try to listen. I don\u2019t play to the camera. I go in there, and I\u2019m really earnest. So when she said that, I was shocked! I was like, No, God, that was a little bit much.\n\nGiven how much you tangle with this particular administration, why do you think you get called on so much? Have you felt like a target? Yes, I have. But I have to shake that off, because I have to go in and do my job. I cover the White House. I cover all issues, particularly those that affect black and brown Americans. Now, what if they didn\u2019t call on me? A certain segment of America would not get the answers to some of their pressing questions.

You had to ask whether this president believed slavery was wrong. I recently asked him, \u201cAre you a racist?\u201d It\u2019s a sad day when you have to ask a sitting president that. There has been a series of comments or lack of action, from calling Elizabeth Warren \u201cPocahontas\u201d to how he dealt with Charlottesville to his comments on Norway versus Haiti, Africa, El Salvador, black and brown nations. It\u2019s not been one thing. It\u2019s been a pattern. So I asked. He did not answer, which I thought was a wasted moment. He could have put it to rest right then and there and said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not a racist.\u201d But it took him days to say that.\n\nYou said it seems as if it has changed, going forward, how the White House deals with the press corps and wields its power.

Who knows what will happen or what another president may want? They may not want to be followed. President Obama didn\u2019t like being followed, for example. This president hates us.

Even the clothes are an 18th-century version of current POTUS style: basic black suit and fat tie. As for Washington, he stands blank-faced, one arm extended, like a tenor taking a dignified bow.\n\n[Read remarks from the Obamas and the artists. ]\n\nUninflected dignity was the attitude of choice for well over a century, with a few breaks. In an 1836 portrait, Andrew Jackson, a demonstrative bully, sports a floor-length, red-silk-lined Dracula cloak and a kind of topiary bouffant. (A picture of Jackson, one of President Trump\u2019s populist heroes, hangs in the Oval Office.) Abraham Lincoln, seen in several likenesses, is exceptional for looking as if he may actually have weighty matters on his mind. Most of the portraits that precede and follow his are pure P.R.\n\nThis continues well into the 20th century. In a 1980 painting Jimmy Carter trades a black suit for a beige one. How revolutionary is that? And there\u2019s a Casual Fridays vogue: Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush both go tieless for it. Under the circumstances, Elaine de Kooning\u2019s 1963 portrait of John F. Kennedy, a fanfare of green and blue strokes, hits like a boost of adrenaline. Rousing too, though not in a good way, is a big head shot image of Bill Clinton by the artist Chuck Close. Using his signature mosaic-like painting technique, Mr. Close turns the 42nd president into a pixelated clown.\n\nMr. Obama has much better luck with his similarly high-profile portraitist. Mr. Wiley, born in Los Angeles in 1977, gained a following in the early 2000s with his crisp, glossy, life-size paintings of young African-American men dressed in hip-hop styles, but depicted in the old-master manner of European royal portraits. More recently he has expanded his repertoire to include female subjects, as well as models from Brazil, India, Nigeria and Senegal, creating the collective image of a global black aristocracy.\n\nIn an imposingly scaled painting \u2014 just over seven feet tall \u2014 the artist presents Mr. Obama dressed in the regulation black suit and an open-necked white shirt, and seated on a vaguely thronelike chair not so different from the one seen in Stuart\u2019s Washington portrait. But art historical references stop there. So do tonal echoes of past portraits. Whereas Mr. Obama\u2019s predecessors are, to the man, shown expressionless and composed, Mr. Obama sits tensely forward, frowning, elbows on his knees, arms crossed, as if listening hard. No smiles, no Mr. Nice Guy. He\u2019s still troubleshooting, still in the game.\n\nVideo\n\nHis engaged and assertive demeanor contradicts \u2014 and cosmetically corrects \u2014 the impression he often made in office of being philosophically detached from what was going on around him. At some level, all portraits are propaganda, political or personal. And what makes this one distinctive is the personal part. Mr. Wiley has set Mr. Obama against \u2014 really embedded him in \u2014 a bower of what looks like ground cover. From the greenery sprout flowers that have symbolic meaning for the sitter. African blue lilies represent Kenya, his father\u2019s birthplace; jasmine stands for Hawaii, where Mr. Obama himself was born; chrysanthemums, the official flower of Chicago, reference the city where his political career began, and where he met his wife.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMrs. Obama\u2019s choice of Ms. Sherald as an artist was an enterprising one. Ms. Sherald, who was born in Columbus, Ga., in 1973 and lives in Baltimore, is just beginning to move into the national spotlight after putting her career on hold for some years to deal with a family health crisis, and one of her own. (She had a heart transplant at 39.) Production-wise, she and Mr. Wiley operate quite differently. He runs the equivalent of a multinational art factory, with assistants churning out work. Ms. Sherald, who until a few years ago made her living waiting tables, oversees a studio staff of one, herself.\n\nAt the same time, they have much in common. Both focused early on African-American portraiture precisely because it is so little represented in Western art history. And both tend to blend fact and fiction. Mr. Wiley, with photo-realistic precision, casts actual people in fantastically heroic roles. (He modifies his heroizing in the case of Mr. Obama, but it\u2019s still there.) Ms. Sherald also starts with realism, but softens and abstracts it. She gives all her figures gray-toned skin \u2014 a color with ambiguous racial associations \u2014 and reduces bodies to geometric forms silhouetted against single-color fields.\n\nShe shows Mrs. Obama sitting against a field of light blue, wearing a spreading gown. The dress design, by Michelle Smith, is eye-teasingly complicated: mostly white interrupted by black Op Art-ish blips and patches of striped color suggestive of African textiles. The shape of the dress, rising pyramidally upward, mountain-like, feels as if it were the real subject of the portrait. Mrs. Obama\u2019s face forms the composition\u2019s peak, but could be almost anyone\u2019s face, like a model\u2019s face in a fashion spread. To be honest, I was anticipating \u2014 hoping for \u2014 a bolder, more incisive image of the strong-voiced person I imagine this former first lady to be.\n\nAnd while I\u2019m wishing, let me mention something more. Mr. Obama\u2019s portrait will be installed, long-term, among those of his presidential peers, in a dedicated space on the second floor. Mrs. Obama\u2019s will hang in a corridor reserved for temporary displays of new acquisitions \u2014 on the first floor. It will stay there until November, after which there\u2019s no set-aside place for it to land.\n\nIf first men have an acknowledged showcase, first women \u2014 ladies or not \u2014 should too. Better, they should all be together, sharing space, offering a welcoming environment to, among others, a future first female president, and creating a lasting monument to #MeToo.", "keywords": ["fact", "fiction", "portraits", "ms", "mr", "obamas", "paint", "wiley", "black", "politics", "portrait", "washington", "sherald", "blend", "obama"], "polarity": 0.07208600786186993, "subjectivity": 0.35921572042261696},

The film recently broke the advance ticket sales record for any movie released in the first quarter, according to the online vendor Fandango, surpassing \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d and the 2017 live-action remake of \u201cBeauty and the Beast.\u201d\n\nThe morning after a red-carpet premiere in Hollywood last month that left Twitter swooning, the stars, director and producer of the film gathered for a spirited conversation about their role in challenging standard depictions of the African diaspora on screen.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTaking part in the discussion were Mr. Coogler; Chadwick Boseman, who plays T\u2019Challa, a.k.a. Black Panther, king of the fictional African nation of Wakanda; Lupita Nyong\u2019o (Nakia, a Wakandan spy and T\u2019Challa\u2019s love interest); Michael B. Jordan (Erik Killmonger, an African-American adversary of Black Panther\u2019s); Danai Gurira (Okoye, Wakanda\u2019s greatest warrior); and Kevin Feige, a producer of \u201cBlack Panther\u201d and president of Marvel Studios. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.\n\nI read a funny tweet the other day that said this movie is basically reparations.\n\n[Rolling laughter]\n\nCHADWICK BOSEMAN I still want my reparations! I still want my reparations!\n\nRYAN COOGLER [laughing] I think only reparations can be reparations.\n\nPhoto\n\nIt\u2019s silly, but is there a kernel of truth there for any of you? The idea that Disney and Marvel investing so much in a movie with a black cast and crew can count as something like restitution?\n\nDANAI GURIRA What it does in such a beautiful way, to me, is it sets a precedent. We\u2019ve read a lot of subtitles for German and Russian \u2014 we can read subtitles for African languages now. People can\u2019t go back and say, \u201cNo, that\u2019s going to be too hard, it\u2019s Africa.\u201d They can\u2019t do that. And that is so thrilling to me.\n\nMICHAEL B. JORDAN It couldn\u2019t have been done on a bigger level. If Marvel is behind it, then it\u2019s gotta be O.K. Moving forward, everybody\u2019s going to start to have the courage to tell bold stories that people didn\u2019t think were lucrative, didn\u2019t think that anybody wanted to see. All of that, I feel, is getting ready to dissolve.\n\nBOSEMAN It has to.\n\nGURIRA No, it will.\n\nCOOGLER What I\u2019ll say is, this is my second time working in the studio system, and they say it\u2019s the studio system, but it\u2019s really the people system. It\u2019s who\u2019s running the studio? How are they running it? When you look at Disney with [Tendo Nagenda, executive vice president for production at Walt Disney Studios, and Nate Moore, a producer at Marvel Studios and an executive producer of \u201cBlack Panther\u201d], it\u2019s a place that\u2019s interested in representation, not just for the sake of representation, but representation because that\u2019s what works, that\u2019s what\u2019s going to make quality stuff that the world is going to embrace, that\u2019s what leads to success.\n\nPhoto\n\nKevin, there\u2019s long been this idea in Hollywood that movies with black casts don\u2019t perform well internationally. Does that end with \u201cBlack Panther\u201d?\n\nKEVIN FEIGE I certainly hope so. One thing I would always remind Ryan of when we would talk about humor and entertainment value in the film was that the biggest statement this movie can make is to be a success around the globe. And I think he\u2019s delivered a movie that\u2019s going to do that, and that disproves [beliefs] that had maybe never been true but had never been tested.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor the actors, what did joining this film mean to you and how did it feel different from other movies you\u2019ve done?\n\nBOSEMAN I\u2019ve done other films that have had historic significance because of what has happened in the past, but this not only refers to the past, it sets the stage for where we\u2019re going.\n\nGURIRA I\u2019ve had a passion for telling African stories for a really long time, being American-born and Zimbabwe-raised. That biculturalism is something that I try to address in my work as a playwright [her 2016 drama \u201cEclipsed\u201d was nominated for a Tony for best play], but nothing can address it like a Marvel movie. I had a childlike glee after my meeting with Ryan \u2014 I kind of floated around, found my car somehow. You think you\u2019re alone in the struggle until you meet someone and then you think, \u201cOh wow, we\u2019re all in it together? And y\u2019all are doing this already? And I just have to be in it?\u201d It was just so beautiful.\n\nLUPITA NYONG\u2019O Seeing it yesterday, I\u2019m even more excited about the celebration of pan-Africanism, because this movie is really about a contemporary Africa relating very intimately with a contemporary America via the characters of Black Panther and Killmonger. We\u2019re talking about some really deep issues that we don\u2019t often voice but we all feel. [Ms. Nyong\u2019o was born in Mexico to Kenyan parents and raised in Kenya.]\n\nPhoto\n\nBOSEMAN A lot of times, being [a black man] in Hollywood, when you get material you\u2019ll read it and you\u2019ll be like, \u201cThat\u2019s not us.\u201d When I got the initial call from Kevin Feige, my hope was that they would have the courage to give Black Panther its true essence and put somebody behind it that would have my same passion for what it could be. And they did that.\n\nOn set, did you have that feeling of \u201cThis is important\u201d or did you just try to do good work like normal?\n\nCOOGLER I learned a skill from playing football. I was a wide receiver \u2014 they throw you the ball, you can\u2019t drop it. So I learned that you gotta tune everything else out.\n\nIf I get to set and there\u2019s a hundred black people on the side of a waterfall and Lupita is dressed in this adornment and Danai is dressed in this adornment and they\u2019re like, \u201cHey Ryan, do I stand here or here?\u201d I can\u2019t think, \u201cAh, this is amazing, I\u2019m making \u2018Black Panther\u2019 and there\u2019s all these black folks on screen!\u201d I really gotta tell Danai that she needs to move over here, and I gotta tell her five reasons why she\u2019s gotta move over here, because she\u2019s gonna wanna know \u2019em! [Laughter]\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut seriously, I grew up reading these comic books and watching all these movies. If I really thought about the fact that I\u2019m making one of these things right now, with people I know and love, I would break down emotionally. I wouldn\u2019t be no good to anybody.\n\nNYONG\u2019O A moment when I really felt a vibration was when we were shooting [the waterfall scene]. There were hundreds of extras and we were all in these traditional clothes and there were all the tribal colors and drumming, and between takes, the drummers started riffing to [Snoop Dogg\u2019s] \u201cDrop It Like It\u2019s Hot.\u201d The whole crowd started to go [sings the melody] and we were all dancing as Ryan figured things out below.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn that moment, I was like, \u201cThis is big.\u201d I had never been on a set with so many black people before and we were all so focused and I could feel a vibration in the air. We all felt so privileged to have an opportunity to be a part of this moment in history.\n\nMichael, one of the interesting complexities of the film comes from Killmonger\u2019s identity as an African-American, which contrasts against T\u2019Challa\u2019s African-ness. What did you want to bring to the character?\n\nJORDAN Ryan [and I] started getting into the back story of where he came from and how his upbringing really affected his personality, his outlook, his rage, his agenda. We felt like we could show where Erik is coming from and make people feel why he is so angry, why he is so lost. He doesn\u2019t know who he is, but he knows the answers are out there.\n\nBOSEMAN For me, [Killmonger and T\u2019Challa] are two sides of the same coin \u2014 African and African-American. As an African-American, if you\u2019re disconnected from your ancestry and your past, you have this conflict that comes from that and so there is a healing experience that is possible because of that.\n\nCOOGLER The fracture that Killmonger has, that\u2019s the fracture I lived with my whole life. I\u2019m from a place that I\u2019d never been to and that nobody who I loved had been to because they couldn\u2019t afford to go [to Africa. Mr. Coogler grew up in Richmond in Northern California]. So I would hear stories from them about this place that they didn\u2019t even know anything about, and those stories were a counterbalance to the awful things that we did hear about them.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn the movie, Wakanda disguises vast technological resources from the world, and white people who aren\u2019t in the know refer to it dismissively as a primitive backwater. That\u2019s a very real view that a lot of people hold about Africa, as recent comments attributed to the president made clear. What do you hope will be the effect of introducing audiences to this counternarrative about the continent?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCOOGLER The narrative about the continent that we know is actually a fairly recent narrative, if you think about human history. It\u2019s a narrative that was born out of what happened when the countries of Africa were conquered.\n\nBut the truth is that some of those places that people might refer to as backwaters \u2014 and these recent comments definitely aren\u2019t the first time somebody has said something like that \u2014 were the cradle of civilization. They were the first places to do anything that we would consider to be civilized.\n\nAll the structures that we built in Wakanda, they\u2019re taller structures of what you\u2019ll find in Africa. Some of them we switched up \u2014 instead of mud we used [the fictional supermetal] vibranium \u2014 but those are buildings that you\u2019ll really find in Mali, in Ethiopia, in Nigeria.\n\nI spent about three weeks in Africa [doing research for \u201cBlack Panther\u201d] and I truly felt that seeing it for myself was necessary for my growth as a human being.

While it is true that compared with Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton lost ground with that segment of the electorate, the clues to a new Democratic majority may be found in the coalition that elected Mr. Northam governor of Virginia, or perhaps more accurately, voted against Mr. Gillespie and his immigrant bashing.\n\nIn Virginia, polling data has made it clear that Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 rhetoric backfired among minority voters as well as, crucially, among many whites. Mr. Northam won a majority of white college-educated voters, who made up a larger share of the electorate in 2017 than they did in 2016. Mr. Gillespie matched Mr. Trump with noncollege whites, but their turnout was down. And minority voters in 2017 matched their 2016 electorate share \u2014 for the first time ever there was no drop-off from the presidential to the gubernatorial election. The Democrats also expanded their margin of victory in Virginia from five percentage points in 2016 to nine points in 2017.\n\nBefore the vote in Virginia, pundits on both the right and left were speculating that Mr. Gillespie\u2019s anti-immigrant strategy was working. But in the end, election results and polling data in Virginia proved all that thinking was wrong. While each state has its own demographics and distinct politics, Virginia has voters who span demographic and economic spectrums. Majorities of voters of all races and ethnicities rejected anti-immigrant stereotypes as ugly and wrong.\n\nAccording to an election eve survey of voters by Latino Decisions, Latino voters said that Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 ads made them less enthusiastic about him, by a 45-point margin. But it wasn\u2019t just Latino voters. By a 23-point margin (52 to 29), whites in Virginia also said the MS-13 ads turned them away from Mr. Gillespie, as did African-American and Asian-American voters by larger margins.\n\nData speaks louder than punditry, and our regression analysis of survey data paints a clear picture. Exposure to Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 ads actually helped drive white college-educated voters away from the Republicans. When we analyzed findings for white independents and Republicans, voters who were aware of the MS-13 ads were significantly more likely to vote for Mr. Gillespie\u2019s Democratic opponent. What should be alarming for Republicans is that this effect wasn\u2019t limited to the governor\u2019s race. The Gillespie campaign had coattail effects, but of the wrong stripe. Across all racial groups, those who were aware of Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 ads were significantly more likely to vote for Democratic candidates for Virginia\u2019s House of Delegates.\n\nThis means that not only is it morally just for Democrats to position themselves as the party that stands against hatred and bigotry and in favor of inclusiveness and opportunity, but it is also a strategically sound position for winning votes. Simultaneously, it sends a clear, welcoming message to Latino, African-American and Asian-American voters, while also winning over enough of the white voters who also oppose immigrant bashing.\n\nThis phenomenon is particularly true of voters who will decide crucial House and Senate races in 2018: people of color and white college-educated voters \u2014 also known as the Democratic base. Mr. Trump and his fellow Republicans are clearly gearing up for a similar anti-immigrant effort in 2018. But now the mask has been pulled off. Voters get it. Democrats have an opportunity to speak out strongly against bigotry. And in doing so, they have a path to victory in 2018 and beyond.", "keywords": ["vote", "ms13", "mr", "white", "democrats", "win", "gillespies", "immigration", "ads", "virginia", "republicans", "voters"], "polarity": 0.10965551203646441, "subjectivity": 0.4705427288760622},

While there is no way to articulate the full scope of those arguments in a single essay, it\u2019s worth considering the philosophical contributions of some of the forerunners of the movement that is our most urgent manifestation of black thought today.\n\nThe end of the Civil War and the subsequent ratification of the 13th Amendment in 1865 legally abolished slavery, but blacks quickly became subject to a displaced form of violence at the hands of white supremacists across the nation who typically used false accusations of sexual assault to justify lynching black men. Police turned a blind eye to these murders, and sometimes actively facilitated them.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIda B. Wells, a leading black thinker and journalist in the late-19th and early 20th centuries, and a co-founder of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, built a public career documenting lynchings and calling America to account for them. Her arguments extended and amplified those made by Frederick Douglass before her. Douglass\u2019s central claim in his seminal \u201cThe Meaning of July Fourth for the Negro\u201d was that Americans should feel shame for slavery, given their country\u2019s foundational commitment to liberty and the pursuit of happiness. We were failing our own ideals.\n\nWells pointed to the rise of lynching after the fall of slavery as not merely a legal matter to be rectified with new laws. Having fled her hometown to escape threats of her own lynching, Wells used the press to make her moral arguments. She described a nation in the grip of a dark remorse for freeing black Americans from slavery, and condemned white Americans for cruelties that violated their own commitment to the democratic project.\n\nThe horrors that Wells described were a factor in the Great Migration of blacks to the North, which fed the flourishing of black thought and cultural life that gave rise to the Harlem Renaissance. An indication that the Harlem Renaissance was always meant to be a period of radical black philosophy and social change was the name originally coined for the movement: The New Negro. Alain Locke, the Harvard-educated black intellectual who became known as the father of the Harlem Renaissance, envisioned a philosophical position that reinvigorated blacks\u2019 relationship to their culture and that would in turn solidify their status as equal co-participants in our democracy.\n\nA strong theme among some of the luminaries of the time focused on the will of blacks to assert their humanity against racism and to insist on their status as persons owed respect. Among those stars, the poet Langston Hughes was one of the brightest. His \u201cI Too\u201d is a quiet yet insistent poem depicting a black man employed by a white one and his struggle with invisibility. The protagonist resolves to sit at the table with the white folks the next day and show people how beautiful he is and that he, too, is America. The writer Zora Neale Hurston had an equally persistent but at times more playful take on the matter. In her essay \u201cHow It Feels to Be Colored Me,\u201d she wrote, \u201cSometimes, I feel discriminated against, but it does not make me angry. It merely astonishes me. How can any deny themselves the pleasure of my company! It\u2019s beyond me.\u201d\n\nThinkers like Hughes and Hurston were involved in the Harlem Renaissance project of presenting a vision of black cultural vitality and worth that would rework the image of black Americans that whites typically relied upon. That stream of thought runs directly into the heart of Black Lives Matter.\n\nAnother valuable and necessary development to come out of the Black Lives Matter movement is the de-emphasizing of black patriarchy and the equal acknowledgment of the suffering of black women and the black L.G.T.B.Q. community. Though sexuality was an avenue of inquiry during the Harlem Renaissance, it was perhaps the mid- to late-20th century poet and theorist Audre Lorde who did the most to make black women\u2019s sexuality a focal point of political and social philosophy.\n\nWhile today \u201cintersectionality\u201d is bandied about as the cutting edge of social research, it was Lorde who in her writing insisted on complicating our view of personal identity by claiming that each of us belongs to multiple identity communities, all of which contribute to our sense of self and our purposes.\n\nShe also showed the broad reach of white supremacy and its effects on black Americans as they located themselves in more nuanced ways in the tapestry of American culture. For her, the primary form taken by resistance to racism was the denial of blunt categories imposed on black Americans, which stifled the possibility of an individual\u2019s full flourishing. Lorde, then, called for a radical form of self-possession whose boundaries were not open to negotiation with a white society.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen people think of Black Lives Matter, they often think of anger feeding forceful protests. Anger is a reasonable response to racial injustice. To be certain, groups like the Black Panthers and thinkers like Malcolm X advised black Americans to get angry and take the doctrine of armed self-defense seriously. Though anger and love are not mutually exclusive emotions, James Baldwin and Martin Luther King Jr. affirmed a view of civic love to pre-empt the need for violence.\n\nKing espoused a form of Kantian regard that prioritized conceiving of every human, racist or not, as owed a kind of love that is grounded in the ideal of universal respect. Baldwin held a slightly different view. He felt black Americans ought to see whites as democratic kin or family, as people with whom blacks would have serious quarrels but also people whom it would be worth keeping close in order to strengthen and bring integrity to the bonds of shared democratic life. These two views of love eschewed violence yet insisted on militancy. While forgiveness and acceptance were hallmarks of King\u2019s and Baldwin\u2019s views, so was an unyielding commitment to self-respect and the demand for social change to institutionalize the idea that blacks were co-creators of the American kingdom.\n\nThinkers like Wells, Hughes, Hurston, Lorde and Baldwin not only anticipated the current Black Lives Matter movement but provided an intellectual blueprint to give depth and integrity to that slogan, so that its meaning transcends the demand to stop police brutality. It is a demand for whites to extend their historical imagination and recognize that the ills of racism are not the result of a few bad police officers or a few out-and-out racists in some far-off corner of America. The problem, rather, is a kind of complicity \u2014 one partaking in the false comfort that America has somehow escaped the trajectory of its racially murderous history. It is necessary that we to see our society today as continuous with that history and not anomalous to it.\n\nBlack thought\u2019s primary contribution to the academy and to American society is the richness and precision with which it describes our worst demons to us, while offering a vision of how we might each save our democracy from the ruin of irrational fear and hatred.", "keywords": ["matter", "harlem", "showed", "renaissance", "america", "white", "black", "blacks", "americans", "movement", "lives"], "polarity": 0.043612258953168, "subjectivity": 0.3973699190419967},

Bell Pottinger may have set back race relations in South Africa by as much as 10 years.\u201d\n\nWithin days of the firm\u2019s removal from the trade association, clients were fleeing. By the end of September, all 250 employees were laid off and Bell Pottinger was finished.\n\nA Unique Client List\n\nLondon is now home to a cluster of P.R. firms catering to foreign governments, raising worries that the city has become \u201cthe global capital of reputation laundering,\u201d as The Evening Standard put it a few years ago. Bell Pottinger established the template of this lucrative niche.\n\nIt was largely the brainchild of Tim Bell, who had earned his reputation, along with a knighthood, helping Margaret Thatcher win three elections. He came to fame with the \u201cLabour isn\u2019t working\u201d ads that helped the Conservative Party gain control of Parliament in the 1979 general election. Colleagues actually coined the phrase, and he talked Mrs. Thatcher into adopting it.\n\n\u201cThere were many conversations in which she shouted at me and told me I was an idiot,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI just had to stand my ground and say, \u2018I know what I\u2019m doing.\u2019\u201d\n\nNow 77, Mr. Bell appears to have stepped directly out of an Evelyn Waugh novel with everything but a smoking jacket. Gray haired with an owlish pair of black glasses, he speaks with jaunty indifference and ingratiating candor, a combination that always made the tsk-tskers who disapproved of his client list sound unworldly and na\u00efve.\n\n\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Breaking News Emails Sign up to receive an email from The New York Times as soon as important news breaks around the world.

When the pair started working together in the mid-80s, Mr. Bell was sought after by political leaders and corporations who wanted some of the communications magic he had provided to Mrs. Thatcher.\n\nBell Pottinger quickly had hundreds of clients, a few of them infamous. Mr. Bell attributes his ability to work with virtually anyone to innate optimism.\n\n\u201cI see the good in people,\u201d he said.\n\nThis included Chile\u2019s former dictator Augusto Pinochet. Mr. Pinochet was placed under house arrest in Britain in 1998 as part of an effort to deport him to Spain, where he had been indicted on a charge of torturing Spanish citizens.\n\nAfter two years of legal and political wrangling, Mr. Bell and his allies prevailed when Mr. Pinochet was authorized to freely return to Chile.\n\nBell Pottinger was hardly the only British outfit working for rogues and despots, as well as publicly traded companies, nor was it the largest or most profitable. But it had a buccaneering spirit that made it the firm of choice for a wide variety of missions.\n\n\n\nDuring the war in Iraq, Bell Pottinger had a contract with the Pentagon to produce propaganda for the United States military. This included scripts in Arabic for a soap opera that aired in the country, said Mr. Bell.\n\n\n\nPhoto\n\nWhen the company\u2019s client list did not generate news, its methods did. In 2011, it was caught boasting about its skills in the dark arts of search engine manipulation to people it thought were potential clients.\n\nIn fact, they were undercover members of the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, a nonprofit organization that works with a variety of media. Posing as executives from the made-up Azimov Group, these \u201crepresentatives\u201d said the company had ties to the Uzbekistan regime, which has been criticized for repression and for using forced child labor during its cotton harvest.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Azimov executives said they worried about blowback.\n\nFret not, said Tim Collins, a Bell Pottinger managing director, per transcripts published by The Independent, a British newspaper. After the company applied its tech wizardry, \u201cYou get to the point where even if they type in \u2018Uzbek child labour\u2019 or \u2018Uzbek human rights violation,\u2019 some of the first results that come up are sites talking about what you guys are doing to address and improve that, not just the critical voices saying how terrible this all is.\u201d\n\nMr. Bell never challenged the transcripts, but he denounced the sting at the time as an \u201cunethical, underhand deception to manufacture a story where none exists.\u201d\n\nBeginning of the End\n\nBell Pottinger\u2019s slide into oblivion began with a visit to the Guptas in January 2016. Mr. Bell, who had worked in South Africa for years, said he had no idea what the brothers wanted, but he and several colleagues flew to Johannesburg to find out.\n\n\u201cWe went to this bloody great mansion, which seemed to be their headquarters,\u201d Mr. Bell recalled. \u201cGreat big room, huge sofas all over the place. Servants. Appalling, all of it.\u201d\n\nThe family already had a fortune, Tony Gupta told the small entourage. Now, he and his brothers wanted to help poor blacks. To that end, they wanted a P.R. campaign that pushed the idea of economic emancipation.\n\n\u201cSo we went back to London and wrote a strategy,\u201d said Mr. Bell. \u201cTown hall meetings, marching in the street, that kind of thing. Draw attention to the economic imbalance, then tell people they should protest and demand change.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe company drafted a two-page proposal, a copy of which was reviewed by The New York Times. Among its recommendations was \u201ca non-party political narrative around the existence of economic apartheid\u201d that Bell Pottinger would package \u201cinto speeches, news releases, website content, videos/broadcast content, slogans and other material required.\u201d\n\nSoon, the Guptas said that their company needed communications help, too. Most South Africans, the Guptas maintained, had an inflated notion of how much of the family\u2019s revenue came from government contracts, which harmed their interests, several Bell Pottinger employees recalled.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe corporate campaign was the first sign that altruism had little to do with the \u00a3100,000 a month that Bell Pottinger would earn during what was initially a three-month project. The second was the anger of the company\u2019s other South Africa clients when they learned of the arrangement.\n\nThe billionaire Johann Rupert was aghast to suddenly find himself one of the most prominent examples of \u201cwhite monopoly capital.\u201d He texted Mr. Bell and asked how his P.R. firm could also be working for a family that was bashing him. Mr. Bell, by his own account, quickly lost enthusiasm for the Gupta project.\n\n\u201cIt was altogether smelly,\u201d he said of the racial element of the work. But he quickly added that ethics were not the issue. If enough South African clients quit Bell Pottinger, he reasoned, the losses would outweigh the Guptas\u2019s checks. \u201cI was saying it\u2019s not a commercially sensible thing to do.\u201d\n\nBut by the end of March, only one client \u2014 the banking and asset management company Investec \u2014 had severed ties with the P.R. firm. After that, Bell Pottinger tried to find middle ground by signing a new contract with the Guptas, this time with a codicil literally called an anti-embarrassment clause. It allowed the firm to terminate the account \u201cwithout notice\u201d if the brothers brought discredit to the business.\n\nMr. Bell said he soon resolved to quit the company because he felt undermined and undervalued by Mr. Henderson. \u201cHe made my life a misery from start to finish,\u201d said Mr. Bell, speaking one recent afternoon in the living room of his home near London\u2019s Sloane Square. After negotiating a \u00a33.5 million exit package, Mr. Bell resigned in August 2016.\n\nPhoto\n\nFor his part, Mr. Henderson declined in a recent interview to indulge in the put-downs that come so easily to his antagonist. Seated at a conference table in temporary offices in Mayfair, where he is starting a new P.R. firm, he said Bell Pottinger\u2019s dissolution was too recent to discuss.\n\n\u201cI have huge empathy for all those impacted,\u201d he said, \u201cand believe now is not the appropriate time to go into details.\u201d\n\nInflaming Tensions\n\nThe P.R. campaign in South Africa, which started in 2016, was intended to raise the temperature of race relations. And it worked.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMore than 100 fake Twitter accounts were created, all of them retweeting content from other Twitter accounts with names like @economycapture, according to media reports. Popular hashtags included #WhiteMonopolyCapital and #RespectGuptas. The campaign involved some 220,000 tweets.\n\nThere were also attack website with names like WMC Leaks and WMC Scams. Another part of this ecosystem were mainstream media outlets owned by the Guptas, like ANN7, a 24-hour news channel, and The New Age, a daily newspaper.\n\nAs the campaign spread, leaders at groups like the A.N.C. Youth League gave inflammatory speeches, decrying the \u201cstranglehold\u201d that rich whites had on the economy. Leaked emails would later show that the groups received media training, and in some cases funds, from Oakbay.\n\nAn atmosphere of menace slowly pervaded the country. In July 2016, the police minister announced the creation of a task force to investigate the murder of more than a dozen political figures. In the run-up to municipal elections that year, Mr. Zuma described the Democratic Alliance, the A.N.C.\u2019s main rival, as a \u201cwhite party,\u201d adding that it could not \u201crun this country no matter how they cover up by getting a few black stooges.\u201d\n\nNew and radical groups like Black First Land First sprang up, holding public rallies to fulminate against whites. At one, in May 2016, a pastor named Xola Skosana told the crowd, \u201cWe have been wounded beyond measure. Let us find the pillars and bring the house down. Black people must be avenged.\u201d\n\nFor the first time in years, whites felt a rising sense of personal danger. Nicholas Wolpe, a white South African whose father was a pioneer of the anti-apartheid movement, remembers a palpable anxiety. \u201cThere was a shift toward intolerance,\u201d he said. \u201cGradually, the debate about white monopoly capital was everywhere and the people talking about it were loud and belligerent. It struck a nerve.\u201d\n\nIn a related and surreptitious campaign, the Guptas were being recast as warmhearted people eager to help the downtrodden. A website connected to Black First Land First ran editorials defending the brothers, suggesting in one that they should be \u201cpraised for saving jobs.\u201d\n\n", "keywords": ["met", "bell", "africa", "company", "reading", "end", "mr", "main", "despots", "firm", "campaign", "pottinger", "pr", "rogues", "south", "guptas"], "polarity": 0.05728090899659527, "subjectivity": 0.3829289628309236},

Just as Ms. Robinson and Ms. Gilmore led the 1955-56 boycott of buses in Alabama, in the 1970s, women like Louise Day Hicks led the antibusing crusades in the North, in an effort to avoid the desegregation of Boston public schools. While men debated in legislative chambers and listened to challenges on the bench, women headed to school cafeterias, playgrounds and PTA meetings, doing the bulk of the behind-the-scenes work of supporting the politics of segregation.\n\nWhite women organized precinct gatherings to pressure their politicians to uphold Jim Crow laws. They transformed their homes into centers of bureaucratic efficiency \u2014 copying fliers, assigning neighborhoods for petition drives and scheduling protest shifts at elementary schools and bus garages.\n\nIt was also women who shaped the way segregation, white supremacy and ideas about racial identity were knitted into the fabric of their communities. Working as midwives, teachers and social workers, women policed the racial identity of babies, students and clients to ensure that the dividing line between white and black remained intact. And across the nation, women-led groups like Patriotic American Youth and the Women for Constitutional Government and Pro America spread the message to the next generation that opposition to racial equality was about states\u2019 rights and limited government, not white supremacy.\n\nIf narratives about white supremacy have been shaped by the overwhelmingly masculine lens through which we examine practically all political movements, there are also aspects of white supremacy that make it different. One critical factor here is the central role ascribed to white male sexual and status anxiety and lust for dominance in fomenting organized white-supremacist activities. As part of arguments against desegregation, many who belonged to these movements embraced a narrative that saw white women and girls as vulnerable (to black men), and white men as protectors \u2014 a story line that simultaneously elevated white men and rendered women helpmates and beneficiaries, not activists.\n\nBut this broader narrative obscures and even gives cover to the ways white women sometimes used white supremacy for their own gain. The suffragist Carrie Chapman Catt in the early 20th century argued for women\u2019s voting rights in Southern states on the basis that \u201cwhite supremacy will be strengthened, not weakened, by white women\u2019s suffrage.\u201d In the 1920s, the journalist Nell Battle Lewis of North Carolina never questioned the absolute need for racial segregation even as she criticized the violence committed in the name of Jim Crow. Staying in the racial fold, she was afforded the opportunity to blast her state\u2019s regressive labor and gender politics. Being a white supremacist, even a liberal one, meant that she remained part of the conversation.\n\nThe point, here, is neither to catalog nor to celebrate white women\u2019s contributions to white supremacist politics. Instead, their work should change how we understand history. It is easy to denounce the racist pronouncements and white-supremacist politics of a George Wallace or a Roy Moore. But what white women teach us is that white-supremacist politics is sustained at a much more grass-roots level by our neighbors, school boards and even friends. White women have made white supremacy a much more formidable and long-lasting force in American society, sustaining it at both the local and national levels.\n\nToday, it seems, the story America prefers to tell itself about white supremacy has changed little since the middle of the century: Instead of Klan lynchings, we focus on the rally in Charlottesville; instead of George Wallace, we focus on Jeff Sessions or, for that matter, Donald Trump. Outrage over the violence and rhetoric of these men buries an equally important and certainly more intransigent story of longstanding grass-roots and national campaigns populated partly by white women who aim to maintain racial and economic inequities on the American landscape. If we begin to consider their staying power with seriousness rather than surprise \u2014 a surprise not shared by black women \u2014 perhaps we can more effectively prepare to counter this strand of American politics.", "keywords": ["racial", "american", "men", "white", "women", "womens", "politics", "supremacy", "whitesupremacist", "power", "work"], "polarity": 0.08455011423761423, "subjectivity": 0.23956078643578646},

But a new analysis from the Center for New York City Affairs at the New School takes a closer look by mapping the achievement gaps within each public elementary school in New York City. The results reveal the challenges of integrating students across the system, and of integrating under one roof.\n\nThe study is a snapshot that looks at student performance on a single test, the state math assessment given in 2016 to third through fifth graders. At each school, it looks at the race of the test takers and estimates their household income using census information about where they live.\n\nThe report illustrates how closely race, income and academic performance are tied in this city. Almost all students in the study with estimated household incomes below $30,000 were black or Hispanic, while students with household incomes above $80,000 were predominantly white. And the poorer students were, the lower they tended to score on the test, even when they went to the same school as wealthier children.\n\nTake P.S. 8, the Robert Fulton school in Brooklyn Heights, which the Center for American Progress identified last year as having one of the richest Parent Teacher Associations in the country, and which has a relatively diverse student body. While 64 percent of its students passed the state math test in 2016, compared with 36 percent of students citywide, black students at the school were nearly a full proficiency level behind their white peers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBlack students at the school also had significantly lower estimated incomes than white students.\n\nNicole Mader, the co-author of the study, said the lingering achievement gap demonstrates that just having different kinds of students together in the same building is not enough to have true integration. Students must be in the same classrooms, have the same quality of teachers and be disciplined in the same way.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orban, and the right-wing government he leads, have been on the offensive since then over the European Union\u2019s migration policies, which require member states to resettle a quota of refugees. Last week, at a meeting in Budapest of the Visegrad Group, an alliance of central European nations, Mr. Orban said, \u201cWe do not wish to become a destination country for migrants.\u201d\n\nThe media here has offered widespread support to Mr. Okovacs for bringing back a popular production after decades. Origo, a government-friendly news website, published an article with the headline \u201cOnly blacks used to be able to perform this opera because of racist restrictions.\u201d And the online theater magazine szinhaz.hu welcomed what it referred to as the Hungarian State Opera\u2019s \u201cbreaking the ice\u201d by staging the opera with \u201cits excellent Hungarian singers.\u201d\n\nMany conservative columnists, including in the daily Magyar Nemzet, have denounced the \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d of performing the opera only with a black cast. \u201cPolitical correctness is slowly devouring aesthetics,\u201d one columnist said.\n\nThe director of the production, Andras Almasi-Toth, told szinhaz.huthat \u201cwhile performance and staging solutions have progressed \u2014 we play, sing and stage Puccini differently from 50 years ago \u2014 this opera was left out, which makes for a very sterile production. It can only take place on Catfish Row in the 1930s, which gives it a fairy-tale like quality, devoid of its real-life aspects.\u201d\n\nIn a telephone interview, Dr. Ronald Crutcher, an African-American music scholar and president of the University of Richmond, said that he thought the idea of transplanting \u201cPorgy and Bess\u201d to somewhere other than Catfish Row was \u201cfascinating\u201d but added that \u201cthe whole notion of recasting the story as an immigrant struggle is hard to imagine.

He also cited it during his speech at the World Economic Summit in Davos, Switzerland, on Friday.\n\nMr. Trump is right. Black unemployment in the United States reached its lowest level in December. But, as my colleague Linda Qiu reported two weeks ago, the record is the culmination of a longer trend, and there has been no shift in the larger racial unemployment gap:\n\nThe 6.8 percent unemployment rate for black Americans in December is indeed the lowest since 1972, according to the latest monthly data that is available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But the rate has been in decline for several years, decreasing steadily from 16.4 percent in August 2011 to 7.8 percent in January 2017. The December figures also do not reflect a significantly different racial unemployment gap. The black unemployment rate has consistently been double that of the white unemployment rate, and remained at that level in December. Presidents, especially in their first year, generally do not single-handedly influence the labor markets \u2014 as Mr. Trump suggests.\n\nFurther, it\u2019s an open question whether a president can claim credit for economic outputs like unemployment. As my colleague Neil Irwin has explained:\n\nSo does Mr. Trump deserve any credit for solid economic results? If you think the economy is driven by concrete, specific policies around taxes, spending, monetary policy and regulation, the answer is no.

Trump\u2019s religious champions, Michael Gerson writes in The Washington Post, are \u201cassociating evangelicalism with bigotry, selfishness and deception. They are playing a grubby political game for the highest of stakes: the reputation of their faith.\u201d\n\nI sympathize with his distress. But the politicized sectors of conservative evangelicalism have been associated with bigotry, selfishness and deception for a long time. Trump has simply revealed the movement\u2019s priorities. It values the preservation of traditional racial and sexual hierarchies over fuzzier notions of wholesomeness.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve resisted throughout my career the notion that evangelicals are racist, I really have,\u201d Balmer told me. \u201cBut I think the 2016 election demonstrated that the religious right was circling back to the founding principles of the movement.

People who are sympathetic to Christian, conservative Trump supporters \u2014 even if they don\u2019t support Trump themselves \u2014 will say that they\u2019ve been backed into a corner by the expansion of civil rights laws and policies protecting gay people. As they see it, liberals not only won the culture war on gay marriage but now are also demanding that private redoubts of resistance be brought into line.\n\nReferring to the Supreme Court\u2019s 2015 gay-marriage decision, Rod Dreher, a social-conservative Trump critic, wrote, \u201cPost-Obergefell, Christians who hold to the biblical teaching about sex and marriage have the same status in culture, and increasingly in law, as racists.\u201d\n\nDreher obviously thinks they deserve much better. He sees a fundamental difference between Christians who thought their religious freedom was trampled by desegregation and Christians who think their religious freedom is trampled when their business and charities have to serve gay people.\n\nBut it seems absurd to ask secular people to respect the religious right\u2019s beliefs about sex and marriage \u2014 and thus tolerate a degree of anti-gay discrimination \u2014 while the movement\u2019s leaders treat their own sexual standards as flexible and conditional.

In 1974, her biography \u201cThomas Jefferson: An Intimate History\u201d contended that the third president had fathered children with his slave Sally Hemings. For this, Catherine Kerrison, a professor of American history at Villanova University, accurately notes, Brodie was \u201cexcoriated by a cadre of Jefferson experts.\u201d A lot has changed, and largely because of the work of Annette Gordon-Reed, who took seriously Hemings family stories and, bolstered by a DNA study, convinced nearly all scholars, including Kerrison, that Brodie was correct. \u201cJefferson\u2019s Daughters,\u201d Kerrison\u2019s beautifully written book, takes the relationship\u2019s existence as a given.\n\nAnd so, to a nuanced study of Jefferson\u2019s two white daughters, Martha (born 1772) and Maria (born 1778), she innovatively adds a discussion of his only enslaved daughter, Harriet Hemings (born 1801). The result is a stunning if unavoidably imbalanced book, combining detailed treatments of Martha\u2019s and Maria\u2019s experiences with imaginative attempts to reconstruct Harriet\u2019s life.\n\nKerrison first examines the ill-fated marriage of Thomas Jefferson and the young widow Martha Wayles Skelton. Not ill-fated because of a lack of love or resources, but because of Martha\u2019s repeated problems with childbirth, which caused her death in 1782. Alone of all their children, the two daughters survived into adulthood. Kerrison\u2019s account of the girls\u2019 residence with their father in Paris in the 1780s includes vivid descriptions of the streetscape and architecture they encountered, as well as of the impact of their divergent educational experiences. While the vivacious Martha had five years of rigorous convent education, her sister Maria had less than two. As a result, the older girl, Kerrison contends, later stressed the importance of educating the daughters born to her and her husband, Thomas Mann Randolph, whereas Maria was content to be a conventional wife of the planter Jack Eppes.\n\nThe lives of four Virginia families \u2014 Jeffersons, Randolphs, Eppeses and Hemingses \u2014 were intertwined. Sally Hemings, daughter of Jefferson\u2019s father-in-law by his mulatto slave Elizabeth Hemings, arrived in the Jefferson household in Paris in 1787 at the age of 14 assigned to be the child Maria\u2019s companion. Following Hemings\u2019s oral history, Kerrison relates how Sally, knowing she could claim freedom by remaining in France when Jefferson returned home in 1789, negotiated a promise of eventual freedom for herself and all her children, who were by parentage seven-eighths white \u2014 a promise kept in part by Martha Randolph after her father\u2019s death in 1826. Jefferson listed Beverley, the oldest boy, born 1798, and his younger sister, Harriet, as \u201crun\u201d in 1822, but other sources reveal that he quietly facilitated their departure.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe book\u2019s most innovative chapters attempt to reconstruct, from scattered fragments, Harriet\u2019s life in slavery and freedom. At Monticello, she and her mother \u2014 along with the Randolph family \u2014 lived as adjuncts to the plantation\u2019s master. The house was designed solely for Jefferson\u2019s comfort; Kerrison comments that \u201cfamily life, however, was architecturally all but invisible\u201d there; the master\u2019s white and black dependents lived and worked in small, inconvenient or upstairs rooms. By age 14, Harriet was put to work on a spinning jenny, suggesting to Kerrison that Jefferson might have thought he was training her adequately \u201cfor her future role as a housewife in a working-class household.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Kerrison identified 58 \u201cHarriets\u201d who wed in Washington between 1822 and 1830.

Maria, who like her mother died young from childbirth, leads Kerrison to point out that current attacks on women\u2019s reproductive health threaten \u201cto return women to the conditions endured by their 19th-century forebears,\u201d making Maria\u2019s fate \u201cboth timely and crucial.\u201d Martha and her daughters prompt Kerrison\u2019s musings on women\u2019s education, for \u201cin spite of all their scholarly attainments, they remained, after all, women,\u201d with no obvious way to use their learning in their own day.

His tactics in Birmingham were geared toward maximum media impact. Marches were scheduled to accommodate the evening news \u2014 and when recruits were scarce, Mr. Walker counted on spectators to inflate the white newsmen\u2019s troop count. (\u201cMarchers, spectators?\u201d Mr. Walker said. \u201cTo them we all looked alike.\u201d) He finessed a call from President Kennedy to Coretta Scott King when her husband was jailed, and came up with the idea for King to write his jailhouse epistle. His efforts to get \u201cLetter from Birmingham Jail\u201d published didn\u2019t bear fruit until the campaign succeeded.\n\nMost important, Mr. Walker had known from the start that mass moral witnesses, such as the nonviolent marches led by praying ministers, would not be enough to turn public opinion against segregation and get the desired federal intervention. He would need the segregationists to act out visually the violence and evil at the system\u2019s core. When Mr. Connor briefly deployed the German Shepherds in early April, Mr. Walker exulted, \u201cWe\u2019ve got a movement. We had some police brutality. They brought out the dogs.\u201d Within a month, he got his picture, and King the credit for bringing down American apartheid.\n\nThirty-six years later in New York, March 1999, I was struck by echoes of Birmingham in the protests against Mayor Rudolph Giuliani over the unpunished police shooting of an unarmed African immigrant, Amadou Diallo. A photograph of one of the protesters \u2014 Mr. Giuliani\u2019s predecessor David Dinkins, New York\u2019s first and so far only black mayor \u2014 who was cuffed along with Representative Charles Rangel, reminded me especially of a picture of King and his deputy Ralph Abernathy being arrested in Birmingham on Good Friday, 1963. It didn\u2019t surprise me to discover Mr. Walker\u2019s fingerprints all over these electrifying demonstrations. He was at the time on the board of the Rev. Al Sharpton\u2019s National Action Network, which organized the protests.\n\nTwo years later, when my book on Birmingham came out, I brought a magazine photographer to Mr. Walker\u2019s church to take our picture. He fixed me with his perfectionist glare and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what it is about you journalists that makes you think Dr. King was so namby-pamby.\u201d\n\nThe last time I saw Mr. Walker was nine years ago, at a King holiday event in Dallas. He had retired from Harlem\u2019s Canaan Baptist and moved to Virginia in the aftermath of strokes that left him dependent on a wheelchair and incapable of much facial expression, though his eyes still radiated trouble and his mouth still delivered the gibes.\n\nWe clutched hands in front of a TV, watching the inauguration of Barack Obama as the 44th president of the United States.

At the S.C.L.C., he devised a structured fund-raising strategy and organized numerous protests, including a series of anti-segregation boycotts and demonstrations in Birmingham, Ala., that came to be known as Project C.\n\nThe C stood for \u201cconfrontation,\u201d and the project is regarded as the blueprint for the civil rights movement\u2019s success in the South.\n\n\u201cThe federal government was against us, the local communities were against us, the judges were against us, but we managed to do it, and I guess we found the strength to do it because it was a moral fight,\u201d Dr. Walker said in an interview for this obituary in 2006.\n\n\u201cI was fully committed to nonviolence, and I believe with all my heart that for the civil rights movement to prove itself, its nonviolent actions had to work in Birmingham,\u201d he continued. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for Birmingham, there wouldn\u2019t have been a Selma march, there wouldn\u2019t have been a 1965 civil rights bill. Birmingham was the birthplace and affirmation of the nonviolent movement in America.\u201d\n\nDr. Walker helped circulate \u201cLetter From Birmingham Jail,\u201d one of the most important documents of the civil rights movement, in which Dr. King argued for civil disobedience as a legitimate response to racial segregation. He also helped organize the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, which culminated with Dr. King\u2019s \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech.\n\nPhoto\n\nScholars and activists alike say his management skills were crucial in turning the S.C.L.C. from a largely volunteer organization into a national power in the civil rights movement, with a million-dollar budget and 100 full-time workers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA March 1964 report by the Alabama Legislative Commission to Preserve the Peace, which investigated civil rights-era militants, subversives and communists, described Dr. Walker as \u201cthe real leader of the Negro movement.\u201d\n\nThe Rev. Jesse L. Jackson said Dr. Walker\u2019s \u201cbrilliance as a strategist was his greatest contribution to the civil rights movement.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe comes from a time when civil rights leaders were martyrs, and not marketers,\u201d Mr. Jackson added. \u201cAnd he knew how to harness the energies of people who were excited about social change, and how to use the church as the center of his advocacy for the poor, the marginalized and the oppressed.\u201d\n\nWyatt Tee Walker, a grandson of a former slave, was born on Aug. 16, 1929, in the shoemaking town of Brockton, Mass., the 10th of 11 children of the Rev. John Wise Walker and the former Maude Pinn. His father had been a member of the first graduating class of Virginia Union University in 1899 and read both Greek and Hebrew. His mother was also a Union graduate, and books filled the family home.\n\nWhen Wyatt was a child the family moved to southern New Jersey, where his father had obtained a post preaching at a small black church in Merchantville. The heavyweight champion Jersey Joe Walcott, who had grown up there, was a family friend.\n\nBut the pulpit produced little income; the family was impoverished during the Depression, Mr. Walker told a biographer for a dissertation; he used cardboard to cover holes in the soles of his shoes. Five siblings died of childhood diseases before he was old enough to remember them, he said.\n\nAfter graduating from high school in Merchantville in 1946, he went south to Virginia Union, carrying $100 that his parents had given him as tuition money to cover the first two semesters. He went on to earn a bachelor\u2019s degree in both physics and chemistry in 1950, graduating with high honors.\n\nPhoto\n\nHe received his master of divinity degree from Union three years later. He also held a doctorate from Colgate Rochester Crozer Divinity School in Rochester. (The Crozer seminary in Pennsylvania had merged with Colgate Rochester in 1970.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAn authority on gospel music and a composer of religious music as well, Dr. Walker published several books and articles that dealt with the relationship among music, black religious tradition and social change. His photography was also the subject of exhibits.\n\nOrdained in 1952, he preached for seven years at the Gillfield Baptist Church in Petersburg, Va. He staged numerous acts of civil disobedience during this time, resulting in 17 arrests. The first one came after he led a group of black men and women through the \u201cwhites only\u201d door of the local library.\n\nIn Petersburg, he served as president of the local branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, state director of the Congress of Racial Equality and founder of the Petersburg Improvement Association, modeled on the Montgomery Improvement Association, which guided the bus boycott in Montgomery, Ala.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

He then moved to Virginia to be closer to relatives.\n\nDr. Walker married Theresa Edwards on Dec. 24, 1950. She survives him, as do a daughter, Patrice Walker Powell; three sons, Robert, Earl and Wyatt Jr.; a sister, Mary Holley; and two granddaughters.\n\nDuring his long tenure at Canaan Baptist, in the heart of Harlem at 116th Street between Adam Clayton Powell Boulevard and Lenox Avenue, Dr. Walker oversaw extensive development of church-sponsored affordable housing, housing for the elderly and what the church calls the oldest senior services center in Harlem.\n\nIn 1999, he was instrumental in establishing Harlem\u2019s first charter school, the Sisulu-Walker Charter School (named for Dr. Walker and the South African anti-apartheid leader Walter Sisulu). He was a strong advocate of providing parents with taxpayer-financed vouchers for private schools, a position that put him at odds with champions of public schools in Harlem.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn addition to the National Action Network, Dr. Walker had been chairman of the Freedom National Bank, which sought to fill Harlem\u2019s economic needs in the absence of major banks for a quarter-century, until it collapsed in 1990 under the weight of risky loans, and the Consortium for Central Harlem Development, which the church says was responsible for $100 million in housing.\n\nFor Dr. Walker, the civil rights movement had not ended with legislative victories in the 1960s. In 1989, speaking from the pulpit of Riverside Church in Manhattan to celebrate Dr. King\u2019s 60th birthday, he said that the establishment of a national holiday to honor King had \u201cseduced us into becoming too comfortable.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cIt is insufficient for us to come together on his birthday, sometimes in an artificial way, white and black together, and sing \u2018We Shall Overcome\u2019 and hold hands and get a warm feeling and then go back to business as usual in white racist America.\u201d\n\nDr. Walker was long on the front lines in the fight against drug trafficking and addiction in Harlem, recruiting other churches and community groups to help in that effort.\n\n\u201cWe wanted our children to have a choice that was better than drugs,\u201d he told The Times in 2015, adding, \u201cYou couldn\u2019t buy aspirin\u201d in the neighborhoods, \u201cbut you could buy any kind of drug.\u201d The police, he said, were \u201coverwhelmed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe just felt they weren\u2019t doing anything about it.\u201d\n\nAt one point the Harlem drug kingpin Frank Lucas \u201cput a hit out on me,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause I was effectively thwarting the drug traffic.\u201d But he said he had shrugged off the threats.\n\n\u201cThey were always warning me that it was dangerous, but that didn\u2019t stop me,\u201d he said. \u201cI had been involved in the struggle in the Deep South, so I was accustomed to dangerous situations.

To some extent, there\u2019s always been an adversarial role between the White House and reporters. How do you feel about the tenor of things now? It used to be friendly-adversarial. There would be retaliation for stories they didn\u2019t like, but nothing compared with this. There\u2019s a war going on. For a president to come out with the term \u201cfake news\u201d \u2014 he\u2019s putting targets on our heads. He has moved the goal posts when it comes to how politicians and people deal with the press.\n\nWhat\u2019s the value of the White House press briefing? Transparency. There is a veil on the White House; people want to look behind the curtain. It\u2019s their house. When you open up a press briefing to see the back and forth, you\u2019re getting more in the weeds of what\u2019s going on, beyond just the quote we may put in the story. This is a key piece that I don\u2019t think people really get: When you talk about the press, it\u2019s not about journalists; it\u2019s about the free-flowing information that the American public is supposed to get. When you bash the press, you\u2019re bashing the idea of getting truth out.\n\nWhat\u2019s the public opinion of the White House press corps? It depends on whom you talk to. We\u2019re so tribal now. There used to be a day when you didn\u2019t know the person\u2019s politics. The line has been obscured between facts and opinion. I think it started during the Clinton years, and it just kept getting progressively worse. People don\u2019t want to just hear the news; they want to hear what people have to say about it too.\n\nYour reactions during the televised briefings have generated memes. Has it made you more self-conscious? I\u2019m so sad about that. My boss has always said, \u201cYou need to know how to play poker.\u201d I don\u2019t. I\u2019m trying! The last time I was really caught off guard was when Sarah Huckabee Sanders said something about people\u2019s minds being in the gutter after President Trump\u2019s tweet about Kirsten Gillibrand. I really get into those briefings. I really try to listen. I don\u2019t play to the camera. I go in there, and I\u2019m really earnest. So when she said that, I was shocked! I was like, No, God, that was a little bit much.\n\nGiven how much you tangle with this particular administration, why do you think you get called on so much? Have you felt like a target? Yes, I have. But I have to shake that off, because I have to go in and do my job. I cover the White House. I cover all issues, particularly those that affect black and brown Americans. Now, what if they didn\u2019t call on me? A certain segment of America would not get the answers to some of their pressing questions. If I don\u2019t ask, who will?\n\nRyan is the White House correspondent and Washington bureau chief for American Urban Radio Networks and a political analyst for CNN.

You had to ask whether this president believed slavery was wrong. I recently asked him, \u201cAre you a racist?\u201d It\u2019s a sad day when you have to ask a sitting president that. There has been a series of comments or lack of action, from calling Elizabeth Warren \u201cPocahontas\u201d to how he dealt with Charlottesville to his comments on Norway versus Haiti, Africa, El Salvador, black and brown nations. It\u2019s not been one thing. It\u2019s been a pattern. So I asked. He did not answer, which I thought was a wasted moment. He could have put it to rest right then and there and said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not a racist.\u201d But it took him days to say that.\n\nYou said it seems as if it has changed, going forward, how the White House deals with the press corps and wields its power. What do you think this means for the next president you cover? He\u2019ll clamp down harder on us. Each president has pushed us further away from access. Who knows what will happen or what another president may want? They may not want to be followed. President Obama didn\u2019t like being followed, for example. This president hates us. He\u2019s warring on us.

The goal is to support 500 interns a year by 2020 \u2014 which, incidentally, might be when Mr. Garcetti follows through on his consideration to run for president.\n\nThe program is called the Evolve Entertainment Fund, and it is partnering with top Hollywood powerhouses like DreamWorks and the Creative Artists Agency to place Hollywood aspirants on a track for a film career.\n\nHollywood has been the subject of criticism for decades about inequality in its ranks, both in front and behind the camera.

Even the clothes are an 18th-century version of current POTUS style: basic black suit and fat tie. As for Washington, he stands blank-faced, one arm extended, like a tenor taking a dignified bow.\n\n[Read remarks from the Obamas and the artists. ]\n\nUninflected dignity was the attitude of choice for well over a century, with a few breaks. In an 1836 portrait, Andrew Jackson, a demonstrative bully, sports a floor-length, red-silk-lined Dracula cloak and a kind of topiary bouffant. (A picture of Jackson, one of President Trump\u2019s populist heroes, hangs in the Oval Office.) Abraham Lincoln, seen in several likenesses, is exceptional for looking as if he may actually have weighty matters on his mind. Most of the portraits that precede and follow his are pure P.R.\n\nThis continues well into the 20th century. In a 1980 painting Jimmy Carter trades a black suit for a beige one. How revolutionary is that? And there\u2019s a Casual Fridays vogue: Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush both go tieless for it. Under the circumstances, Elaine de Kooning\u2019s 1963 portrait of John F. Kennedy, a fanfare of green and blue strokes, hits like a boost of adrenaline. Rousing too, though not in a good way, is a big head shot image of Bill Clinton by the artist Chuck Close. Using his signature mosaic-like painting technique, Mr. Close turns the 42nd president into a pixelated clown.\n\nMr. Obama has much better luck with his similarly high-profile portraitist. Mr. Wiley, born in Los Angeles in 1977, gained a following in the early 2000s with his crisp, glossy, life-size paintings of young African-American men dressed in hip-hop styles, but depicted in the old-master manner of European royal portraits. More recently he has expanded his repertoire to include female subjects, as well as models from Brazil, India, Nigeria and Senegal, creating the collective image of a global black aristocracy.\n\nIn an imposingly scaled painting \u2014 just over seven feet tall \u2014 the artist presents Mr. Obama dressed in the regulation black suit and an open-necked white shirt, and seated on a vaguely thronelike chair not so different from the one seen in Stuart\u2019s Washington portrait. But art historical references stop there. So do tonal echoes of past portraits. Whereas Mr. Obama\u2019s predecessors are, to the man, shown expressionless and composed, Mr. Obama sits tensely forward, frowning, elbows on his knees, arms crossed, as if listening hard. No smiles, no Mr. Nice Guy. He\u2019s still troubleshooting, still in the game.\n\nVideo\n\nHis engaged and assertive demeanor contradicts \u2014 and cosmetically corrects \u2014 the impression he often made in office of being philosophically detached from what was going on around him. At some level, all portraits are propaganda, political or personal. And what makes this one distinctive is the personal part. Mr. Wiley has set Mr. Obama against \u2014 really embedded him in \u2014 a bower of what looks like ground cover. From the greenery sprout flowers that have symbolic meaning for the sitter. African blue lilies represent Kenya, his father\u2019s birthplace; jasmine stands for Hawaii, where Mr. Obama himself was born; chrysanthemums, the official flower of Chicago, reference the city where his political career began, and where he met his wife.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMrs. Obama\u2019s choice of Ms. Sherald as an artist was an enterprising one. Ms. Sherald, who was born in Columbus, Ga., in 1973 and lives in Baltimore, is just beginning to move into the national spotlight after putting her career on hold for some years to deal with a family health crisis, and one of her own. (She had a heart transplant at 39.) Production-wise, she and Mr. Wiley operate quite differently. He runs the equivalent of a multinational art factory, with assistants churning out work. Ms. Sherald, who until a few years ago made her living waiting tables, oversees a studio staff of one, herself.\n\nAt the same time, they have much in common. Both focused early on African-American portraiture precisely because it is so little represented in Western art history. And both tend to blend fact and fiction. Mr. Wiley, with photo-realistic precision, casts actual people in fantastically heroic roles. (He modifies his heroizing in the case of Mr. Obama, but it\u2019s still there.) Ms. Sherald also starts with realism, but softens and abstracts it. She gives all her figures gray-toned skin \u2014 a color with ambiguous racial associations \u2014 and reduces bodies to geometric forms silhouetted against single-color fields.\n\nShe shows Mrs. Obama sitting against a field of light blue, wearing a spreading gown. The dress design, by Michelle Smith, is eye-teasingly complicated: mostly white interrupted by black Op Art-ish blips and patches of striped color suggestive of African textiles. The shape of the dress, rising pyramidally upward, mountain-like, feels as if it were the real subject of the portrait. Mrs. Obama\u2019s face forms the composition\u2019s peak, but could be almost anyone\u2019s face, like a model\u2019s face in a fashion spread. To be honest, I was anticipating \u2014 hoping for \u2014 a bolder, more incisive image of the strong-voiced person I imagine this former first lady to be.\n\nAnd while I\u2019m wishing, let me mention something more. Mr. Obama\u2019s portrait will be installed, long-term, among those of his presidential peers, in a dedicated space on the second floor. Mrs. Obama\u2019s will hang in a corridor reserved for temporary displays of new acquisitions \u2014 on the first floor. It will stay there until November, after which there\u2019s no set-aside place for it to land.\n\nIf first men have an acknowledged showcase, first women \u2014 ladies or not \u2014 should too. Better, they should all be together, sharing space, offering a welcoming environment to, among others, a future first female president, and creating a lasting monument to #MeToo.", "keywords": ["fact", "fiction", "portraits", "ms", "mr", "obamas", "paint", "wiley", "black", "politics", "portrait", "washington", "sherald", "blend", "obama"], "polarity": 0.07208600786186993, "subjectivity": 0.35921572042261696},

The film recently broke the advance ticket sales record for any movie released in the first quarter, according to the online vendor Fandango, surpassing \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d and the 2017 live-action remake of \u201cBeauty and the Beast.\u201d\n\nThe morning after a red-carpet premiere in Hollywood last month that left Twitter swooning, the stars, director and producer of the film gathered for a spirited conversation about their role in challenging standard depictions of the African diaspora on screen.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTaking part in the discussion were Mr. Coogler; Chadwick Boseman, who plays T\u2019Challa, a.k.a. Black Panther, king of the fictional African nation of Wakanda; Lupita Nyong\u2019o (Nakia, a Wakandan spy and T\u2019Challa\u2019s love interest); Michael B. Jordan (Erik Killmonger, an African-American adversary of Black Panther\u2019s); Danai Gurira (Okoye, Wakanda\u2019s greatest warrior); and Kevin Feige, a producer of \u201cBlack Panther\u201d and president of Marvel Studios. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.\n\nI read a funny tweet the other day that said this movie is basically reparations.\n\n[Rolling laughter]\n\nCHADWICK BOSEMAN I still want my reparations! I still want my reparations!\n\nRYAN COOGLER [laughing] I think only reparations can be reparations.\n\nPhoto\n\nIt\u2019s silly, but is there a kernel of truth there for any of you? The idea that Disney and Marvel investing so much in a movie with a black cast and crew can count as something like restitution?\n\nDANAI GURIRA What it does in such a beautiful way, to me, is it sets a precedent. We\u2019ve read a lot of subtitles for German and Russian \u2014 we can read subtitles for African languages now. People can\u2019t go back and say, \u201cNo, that\u2019s going to be too hard, it\u2019s Africa.\u201d They can\u2019t do that. And that is so thrilling to me.\n\nMICHAEL B. JORDAN It couldn\u2019t have been done on a bigger level. If Marvel is behind it, then it\u2019s gotta be O.K. Moving forward, everybody\u2019s going to start to have the courage to tell bold stories that people didn\u2019t think were lucrative, didn\u2019t think that anybody wanted to see. All of that, I feel, is getting ready to dissolve.\n\nBOSEMAN It has to.\n\nGURIRA No, it will.\n\nCOOGLER What I\u2019ll say is, this is my second time working in the studio system, and they say it\u2019s the studio system, but it\u2019s really the people system. It\u2019s who\u2019s running the studio? How are they running it? When you look at Disney with [Tendo Nagenda, executive vice president for production at Walt Disney Studios, and Nate Moore, a producer at Marvel Studios and an executive producer of \u201cBlack Panther\u201d], it\u2019s a place that\u2019s interested in representation, not just for the sake of representation, but representation because that\u2019s what works, that\u2019s what\u2019s going to make quality stuff that the world is going to embrace, that\u2019s what leads to success.\n\nPhoto\n\nKevin, there\u2019s long been this idea in Hollywood that movies with black casts don\u2019t perform well internationally. Does that end with \u201cBlack Panther\u201d?\n\nKEVIN FEIGE I certainly hope so. One thing I would always remind Ryan of when we would talk about humor and entertainment value in the film was that the biggest statement this movie can make is to be a success around the globe. And I think he\u2019s delivered a movie that\u2019s going to do that, and that disproves [beliefs] that had maybe never been true but had never been tested.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor the actors, what did joining this film mean to you and how did it feel different from other movies you\u2019ve done?\n\nBOSEMAN I\u2019ve done other films that have had historic significance because of what has happened in the past, but this not only refers to the past, it sets the stage for where we\u2019re going.\n\nGURIRA I\u2019ve had a passion for telling African stories for a really long time, being American-born and Zimbabwe-raised. That biculturalism is something that I try to address in my work as a playwright [her 2016 drama \u201cEclipsed\u201d was nominated for a Tony for best play], but nothing can address it like a Marvel movie. I had a childlike glee after my meeting with Ryan \u2014 I kind of floated around, found my car somehow. You think you\u2019re alone in the struggle until you meet someone and then you think, \u201cOh wow, we\u2019re all in it together? And y\u2019all are doing this already? And I just have to be in it?\u201d It was just so beautiful.\n\nLUPITA NYONG\u2019O Seeing it yesterday, I\u2019m even more excited about the celebration of pan-Africanism, because this movie is really about a contemporary Africa relating very intimately with a contemporary America via the characters of Black Panther and Killmonger. We\u2019re talking about some really deep issues that we don\u2019t often voice but we all feel. [Ms. Nyong\u2019o was born in Mexico to Kenyan parents and raised in Kenya.]\n\nPhoto\n\nBOSEMAN A lot of times, being [a black man] in Hollywood, when you get material you\u2019ll read it and you\u2019ll be like, \u201cThat\u2019s not us.\u201d When I got the initial call from Kevin Feige, my hope was that they would have the courage to give Black Panther its true essence and put somebody behind it that would have my same passion for what it could be. And they did that.\n\nOn set, did you have that feeling of \u201cThis is important\u201d or did you just try to do good work like normal?\n\nCOOGLER I learned a skill from playing football. I was a wide receiver \u2014 they throw you the ball, you can\u2019t drop it. So I learned that you gotta tune everything else out.\n\nIf I get to set and there\u2019s a hundred black people on the side of a waterfall and Lupita is dressed in this adornment and Danai is dressed in this adornment and they\u2019re like, \u201cHey Ryan, do I stand here or here?\u201d I can\u2019t think, \u201cAh, this is amazing, I\u2019m making \u2018Black Panther\u2019 and there\u2019s all these black folks on screen!\u201d I really gotta tell Danai that she needs to move over here, and I gotta tell her five reasons why she\u2019s gotta move over here, because she\u2019s gonna wanna know \u2019em! [Laughter]\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut seriously, I grew up reading these comic books and watching all these movies. If I really thought about the fact that I\u2019m making one of these things right now, with people I know and love, I would break down emotionally. I wouldn\u2019t be no good to anybody.\n\nNYONG\u2019O A moment when I really felt a vibration was when we were shooting [the waterfall scene]. There were hundreds of extras and we were all in these traditional clothes and there were all the tribal colors and drumming, and between takes, the drummers started riffing to [Snoop Dogg\u2019s] \u201cDrop It Like It\u2019s Hot.\u201d The whole crowd started to go [sings the melody] and we were all dancing as Ryan figured things out below.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn that moment, I was like, \u201cThis is big.\u201d I had never been on a set with so many black people before and we were all so focused and I could feel a vibration in the air. We all felt so privileged to have an opportunity to be a part of this moment in history.\n\nMichael, one of the interesting complexities of the film comes from Killmonger\u2019s identity as an African-American, which contrasts against T\u2019Challa\u2019s African-ness. What did you want to bring to the character?\n\nJORDAN Ryan [and I] started getting into the back story of where he came from and how his upbringing really affected his personality, his outlook, his rage, his agenda. We felt like we could show where Erik is coming from and make people feel why he is so angry, why he is so lost. He doesn\u2019t know who he is, but he knows the answers are out there.\n\nBOSEMAN For me, [Killmonger and T\u2019Challa] are two sides of the same coin \u2014 African and African-American. As an African-American, if you\u2019re disconnected from your ancestry and your past, you have this conflict that comes from that and so there is a healing experience that is possible because of that.\n\nCOOGLER The fracture that Killmonger has, that\u2019s the fracture I lived with my whole life. I\u2019m from a place that I\u2019d never been to and that nobody who I loved had been to because they couldn\u2019t afford to go [to Africa. Mr. Coogler grew up in Richmond in Northern California]. So I would hear stories from them about this place that they didn\u2019t even know anything about, and those stories were a counterbalance to the awful things that we did hear about them.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn the movie, Wakanda disguises vast technological resources from the world, and white people who aren\u2019t in the know refer to it dismissively as a primitive backwater. That\u2019s a very real view that a lot of people hold about Africa, as recent comments attributed to the president made clear. What do you hope will be the effect of introducing audiences to this counternarrative about the continent?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCOOGLER The narrative about the continent that we know is actually a fairly recent narrative, if you think about human history. It\u2019s a narrative that was born out of what happened when the countries of Africa were conquered.\n\nBut the truth is that some of those places that people might refer to as backwaters \u2014 and these recent comments definitely aren\u2019t the first time somebody has said something like that \u2014 were the cradle of civilization. They were the first places to do anything that we would consider to be civilized.\n\nAll the structures that we built in Wakanda, they\u2019re taller structures of what you\u2019ll find in Africa. Some of them we switched up \u2014 instead of mud we used [the fictional supermetal] vibranium \u2014 but those are buildings that you\u2019ll really find in Mali, in Ethiopia, in Nigeria.\n\nI spent about three weeks in Africa [doing research for \u201cBlack Panther\u201d] and I truly felt that seeing it for myself was necessary for my growth as a human being.

While it is true that compared with Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton lost ground with that segment of the electorate, the clues to a new Democratic majority may be found in the coalition that elected Mr. Northam governor of Virginia, or perhaps more accurately, voted against Mr. Gillespie and his immigrant bashing.\n\nIn Virginia, polling data has made it clear that Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 rhetoric backfired among minority voters as well as, crucially, among many whites. Mr. Northam won a majority of white college-educated voters, who made up a larger share of the electorate in 2017 than they did in 2016. Mr. Gillespie matched Mr. Trump with noncollege whites, but their turnout was down. And minority voters in 2017 matched their 2016 electorate share \u2014 for the first time ever there was no drop-off from the presidential to the gubernatorial election. The Democrats also expanded their margin of victory in Virginia from five percentage points in 2016 to nine points in 2017.\n\nBefore the vote in Virginia, pundits on both the right and left were speculating that Mr. Gillespie\u2019s anti-immigrant strategy was working. But in the end, election results and polling data in Virginia proved all that thinking was wrong. While each state has its own demographics and distinct politics, Virginia has voters who span demographic and economic spectrums. Majorities of voters of all races and ethnicities rejected anti-immigrant stereotypes as ugly and wrong.\n\nAccording to an election eve survey of voters by Latino Decisions, Latino voters said that Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 ads made them less enthusiastic about him, by a 45-point margin. But it wasn\u2019t just Latino voters. By a 23-point margin (52 to 29), whites in Virginia also said the MS-13 ads turned them away from Mr. Gillespie, as did African-American and Asian-American voters by larger margins.\n\nData speaks louder than punditry, and our regression analysis of survey data paints a clear picture. Exposure to Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 ads actually helped drive white college-educated voters away from the Republicans. When we analyzed findings for white independents and Republicans, voters who were aware of the MS-13 ads were significantly more likely to vote for Mr. Gillespie\u2019s Democratic opponent. What should be alarming for Republicans is that this effect wasn\u2019t limited to the governor\u2019s race. The Gillespie campaign had coattail effects, but of the wrong stripe. Across all racial groups, those who were aware of Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 ads were significantly more likely to vote for Democratic candidates for Virginia\u2019s House of Delegates.\n\nThis means that not only is it morally just for Democrats to position themselves as the party that stands against hatred and bigotry and in favor of inclusiveness and opportunity, but it is also a strategically sound position for winning votes. Simultaneously, it sends a clear, welcoming message to Latino, African-American and Asian-American voters, while also winning over enough of the white voters who also oppose immigrant bashing.\n\nThis phenomenon is particularly true of voters who will decide crucial House and Senate races in 2018: people of color and white college-educated voters \u2014 also known as the Democratic base. Mr. Trump and his fellow Republicans are clearly gearing up for a similar anti-immigrant effort in 2018. But now the mask has been pulled off. Voters get it. Democrats have an opportunity to speak out strongly against bigotry. And in doing so, they have a path to victory in 2018 and beyond.", "keywords": ["vote", "ms13", "mr", "white", "democrats", "win", "gillespies", "immigration", "ads", "virginia", "republicans", "voters"], "polarity": 0.10965551203646441, "subjectivity": 0.4705427288760622},

While there is no way to articulate the full scope of those arguments in a single essay, it\u2019s worth considering the philosophical contributions of some of the forerunners of the movement that is our most urgent manifestation of black thought today.\n\nThe end of the Civil War and the subsequent ratification of the 13th Amendment in 1865 legally abolished slavery, but blacks quickly became subject to a displaced form of violence at the hands of white supremacists across the nation who typically used false accusations of sexual assault to justify lynching black men. Police turned a blind eye to these murders, and sometimes actively facilitated them.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIda B. Wells, a leading black thinker and journalist in the late-19th and early 20th centuries, and a co-founder of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, built a public career documenting lynchings and calling America to account for them. Her arguments extended and amplified those made by Frederick Douglass before her. Douglass\u2019s central claim in his seminal \u201cThe Meaning of July Fourth for the Negro\u201d was that Americans should feel shame for slavery, given their country\u2019s foundational commitment to liberty and the pursuit of happiness. We were failing our own ideals.\n\nWells pointed to the rise of lynching after the fall of slavery as not merely a legal matter to be rectified with new laws. Having fled her hometown to escape threats of her own lynching, Wells used the press to make her moral arguments. She described a nation in the grip of a dark remorse for freeing black Americans from slavery, and condemned white Americans for cruelties that violated their own commitment to the democratic project.\n\nThe horrors that Wells described were a factor in the Great Migration of blacks to the North, which fed the flourishing of black thought and cultural life that gave rise to the Harlem Renaissance. An indication that the Harlem Renaissance was always meant to be a period of radical black philosophy and social change was the name originally coined for the movement: The New Negro. Alain Locke, the Harvard-educated black intellectual who became known as the father of the Harlem Renaissance, envisioned a philosophical position that reinvigorated blacks\u2019 relationship to their culture and that would in turn solidify their status as equal co-participants in our democracy.\n\nA strong theme among some of the luminaries of the time focused on the will of blacks to assert their humanity against racism and to insist on their status as persons owed respect. Among those stars, the poet Langston Hughes was one of the brightest. His \u201cI Too\u201d is a quiet yet insistent poem depicting a black man employed by a white one and his struggle with invisibility. The protagonist resolves to sit at the table with the white folks the next day and show people how beautiful he is and that he, too, is America. The writer Zora Neale Hurston had an equally persistent but at times more playful take on the matter. In her essay \u201cHow It Feels to Be Colored Me,\u201d she wrote, \u201cSometimes, I feel discriminated against, but it does not make me angry. It merely astonishes me. How can any deny themselves the pleasure of my company! It\u2019s beyond me.\u201d\n\nThinkers like Hughes and Hurston were involved in the Harlem Renaissance project of presenting a vision of black cultural vitality and worth that would rework the image of black Americans that whites typically relied upon. That stream of thought runs directly into the heart of Black Lives Matter.\n\nAnother valuable and necessary development to come out of the Black Lives Matter movement is the de-emphasizing of black patriarchy and the equal acknowledgment of the suffering of black women and the black L.G.T.B.Q. community. Though sexuality was an avenue of inquiry during the Harlem Renaissance, it was perhaps the mid- to late-20th century poet and theorist Audre Lorde who did the most to make black women\u2019s sexuality a focal point of political and social philosophy.\n\nWhile today \u201cintersectionality\u201d is bandied about as the cutting edge of social research, it was Lorde who in her writing insisted on complicating our view of personal identity by claiming that each of us belongs to multiple identity communities, all of which contribute to our sense of self and our purposes.\n\nShe also showed the broad reach of white supremacy and its effects on black Americans as they located themselves in more nuanced ways in the tapestry of American culture. For her, the primary form taken by resistance to racism was the denial of blunt categories imposed on black Americans, which stifled the possibility of an individual\u2019s full flourishing. Lorde, then, called for a radical form of self-possession whose boundaries were not open to negotiation with a white society.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen people think of Black Lives Matter, they often think of anger feeding forceful protests. Anger is a reasonable response to racial injustice. To be certain, groups like the Black Panthers and thinkers like Malcolm X advised black Americans to get angry and take the doctrine of armed self-defense seriously. Though anger and love are not mutually exclusive emotions, James Baldwin and Martin Luther King Jr. affirmed a view of civic love to pre-empt the need for violence.\n\nKing espoused a form of Kantian regard that prioritized conceiving of every human, racist or not, as owed a kind of love that is grounded in the ideal of universal respect. Baldwin held a slightly different view. He felt black Americans ought to see whites as democratic kin or family, as people with whom blacks would have serious quarrels but also people whom it would be worth keeping close in order to strengthen and bring integrity to the bonds of shared democratic life. These two views of love eschewed violence yet insisted on militancy. While forgiveness and acceptance were hallmarks of King\u2019s and Baldwin\u2019s views, so was an unyielding commitment to self-respect and the demand for social change to institutionalize the idea that blacks were co-creators of the American kingdom.\n\nThinkers like Wells, Hughes, Hurston, Lorde and Baldwin not only anticipated the current Black Lives Matter movement but provided an intellectual blueprint to give depth and integrity to that slogan, so that its meaning transcends the demand to stop police brutality. It is a demand for whites to extend their historical imagination and recognize that the ills of racism are not the result of a few bad police officers or a few out-and-out racists in some far-off corner of America. The problem, rather, is a kind of complicity \u2014 one partaking in the false comfort that America has somehow escaped the trajectory of its racially murderous history. It is necessary that we to see our society today as continuous with that history and not anomalous to it.\n\nBlack thought\u2019s primary contribution to the academy and to American society is the richness and precision with which it describes our worst demons to us, while offering a vision of how we might each save our democracy from the ruin of irrational fear and hatred.", "keywords": ["matter", "harlem", "showed", "renaissance", "america", "white", "black", "blacks", "americans", "movement", "lives"], "polarity": 0.043612258953168, "subjectivity": 0.3973699190419967},

Bell Pottinger may have set back race relations in South Africa by as much as 10 years.\u201d\n\nWithin days of the firm\u2019s removal from the trade association, clients were fleeing. By the end of September, all 250 employees were laid off and Bell Pottinger was finished.\n\nA Unique Client List\n\nLondon is now home to a cluster of P.R. firms catering to foreign governments, raising worries that the city has become \u201cthe global capital of reputation laundering,\u201d as The Evening Standard put it a few years ago. Bell Pottinger established the template of this lucrative niche.\n\nIt was largely the brainchild of Tim Bell, who had earned his reputation, along with a knighthood, helping Margaret Thatcher win three elections. He came to fame with the \u201cLabour isn\u2019t working\u201d ads that helped the Conservative Party gain control of Parliament in the 1979 general election. Colleagues actually coined the phrase, and he talked Mrs. Thatcher into adopting it.\n\n\u201cThere were many conversations in which she shouted at me and told me I was an idiot,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI just had to stand my ground and say, \u2018I know what I\u2019m doing.\u2019\u201d\n\nNow 77, Mr. Bell appears to have stepped directly out of an Evelyn Waugh novel with everything but a smoking jacket. Gray haired with an owlish pair of black glasses, he speaks with jaunty indifference and ingratiating candor, a combination that always made the tsk-tskers who disapproved of his client list sound unworldly and na\u00efve.\n\n\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Breaking News Emails Sign up to receive an email from The New York Times as soon as important news breaks around the world.

When the pair started working together in the mid-80s, Mr. Bell was sought after by political leaders and corporations who wanted some of the communications magic he had provided to Mrs. Thatcher.\n\nBell Pottinger quickly had hundreds of clients, a few of them infamous. Mr. Bell attributes his ability to work with virtually anyone to innate optimism.\n\n\u201cI see the good in people,\u201d he said.\n\nThis included Chile\u2019s former dictator Augusto Pinochet. Mr. Pinochet was placed under house arrest in Britain in 1998 as part of an effort to deport him to Spain, where he had been indicted on a charge of torturing Spanish citizens.\n\nAfter two years of legal and political wrangling, Mr. Bell and his allies prevailed when Mr. Pinochet was authorized to freely return to Chile.\n\nBell Pottinger was hardly the only British outfit working for rogues and despots, as well as publicly traded companies, nor was it the largest or most profitable. But it had a buccaneering spirit that made it the firm of choice for a wide variety of missions.\n\n\n\nDuring the war in Iraq, Bell Pottinger had a contract with the Pentagon to produce propaganda for the United States military. This included scripts in Arabic for a soap opera that aired in the country, said Mr. Bell.\n\n\n\nPhoto\n\nWhen the company\u2019s client list did not generate news, its methods did. In 2011, it was caught boasting about its skills in the dark arts of search engine manipulation to people it thought were potential clients.\n\nIn fact, they were undercover members of the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, a nonprofit organization that works with a variety of media. Posing as executives from the made-up Azimov Group, these \u201crepresentatives\u201d said the company had ties to the Uzbekistan regime, which has been criticized for repression and for using forced child labor during its cotton harvest.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Azimov executives said they worried about blowback.\n\nFret not, said Tim Collins, a Bell Pottinger managing director, per transcripts published by The Independent, a British newspaper. After the company applied its tech wizardry, \u201cYou get to the point where even if they type in \u2018Uzbek child labour\u2019 or \u2018Uzbek human rights violation,\u2019 some of the first results that come up are sites talking about what you guys are doing to address and improve that, not just the critical voices saying how terrible this all is.\u201d\n\nMr. Bell never challenged the transcripts, but he denounced the sting at the time as an \u201cunethical, underhand deception to manufacture a story where none exists.\u201d\n\nBeginning of the End\n\nBell Pottinger\u2019s slide into oblivion began with a visit to the Guptas in January 2016. Mr. Bell, who had worked in South Africa for years, said he had no idea what the brothers wanted, but he and several colleagues flew to Johannesburg to find out.\n\n\u201cWe went to this bloody great mansion, which seemed to be their headquarters,\u201d Mr. Bell recalled. \u201cGreat big room, huge sofas all over the place. Servants. Appalling, all of it.\u201d\n\nThe family already had a fortune, Tony Gupta told the small entourage. Now, he and his brothers wanted to help poor blacks. To that end, they wanted a P.R. campaign that pushed the idea of economic emancipation.\n\n\u201cSo we went back to London and wrote a strategy,\u201d said Mr. Bell. \u201cTown hall meetings, marching in the street, that kind of thing. Draw attention to the economic imbalance, then tell people they should protest and demand change.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe company drafted a two-page proposal, a copy of which was reviewed by The New York Times. Among its recommendations was \u201ca non-party political narrative around the existence of economic apartheid\u201d that Bell Pottinger would package \u201cinto speeches, news releases, website content, videos/broadcast content, slogans and other material required.\u201d\n\nSoon, the Guptas said that their company needed communications help, too. Most South Africans, the Guptas maintained, had an inflated notion of how much of the family\u2019s revenue came from government contracts, which harmed their interests, several Bell Pottinger employees recalled.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe corporate campaign was the first sign that altruism had little to do with the \u00a3100,000 a month that Bell Pottinger would earn during what was initially a three-month project. The second was the anger of the company\u2019s other South Africa clients when they learned of the arrangement.\n\nThe billionaire Johann Rupert was aghast to suddenly find himself one of the most prominent examples of \u201cwhite monopoly capital.\u201d He texted Mr. Bell and asked how his P.R. firm could also be working for a family that was bashing him. Mr. Bell, by his own account, quickly lost enthusiasm for the Gupta project.\n\n\u201cIt was altogether smelly,\u201d he said of the racial element of the work. But he quickly added that ethics were not the issue. If enough South African clients quit Bell Pottinger, he reasoned, the losses would outweigh the Guptas\u2019s checks. \u201cI was saying it\u2019s not a commercially sensible thing to do.\u201d\n\nBut by the end of March, only one client \u2014 the banking and asset management company Investec \u2014 had severed ties with the P.R. firm. After that, Bell Pottinger tried to find middle ground by signing a new contract with the Guptas, this time with a codicil literally called an anti-embarrassment clause. It allowed the firm to terminate the account \u201cwithout notice\u201d if the brothers brought discredit to the business.\n\nMr. Bell said he soon resolved to quit the company because he felt undermined and undervalued by Mr. Henderson. \u201cHe made my life a misery from start to finish,\u201d said Mr. Bell, speaking one recent afternoon in the living room of his home near London\u2019s Sloane Square. After negotiating a \u00a33.5 million exit package, Mr. Bell resigned in August 2016.\n\nPhoto\n\nFor his part, Mr. Henderson declined in a recent interview to indulge in the put-downs that come so easily to his antagonist. Seated at a conference table in temporary offices in Mayfair, where he is starting a new P.R. firm, he said Bell Pottinger\u2019s dissolution was too recent to discuss.\n\n\u201cI have huge empathy for all those impacted,\u201d he said, \u201cand believe now is not the appropriate time to go into details.\u201d\n\nInflaming Tensions\n\nThe P.R. campaign in South Africa, which started in 2016, was intended to raise the temperature of race relations. And it worked.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMore than 100 fake Twitter accounts were created, all of them retweeting content from other Twitter accounts with names like @economycapture, according to media reports. Popular hashtags included #WhiteMonopolyCapital and #RespectGuptas. The campaign involved some 220,000 tweets.\n\nThere were also attack website with names like WMC Leaks and WMC Scams. Another part of this ecosystem were mainstream media outlets owned by the Guptas, like ANN7, a 24-hour news channel, and The New Age, a daily newspaper.\n\nAs the campaign spread, leaders at groups like the A.N.C. Youth League gave inflammatory speeches, decrying the \u201cstranglehold\u201d that rich whites had on the economy. Leaked emails would later show that the groups received media training, and in some cases funds, from Oakbay.\n\nAn atmosphere of menace slowly pervaded the country. In July 2016, the police minister announced the creation of a task force to investigate the murder of more than a dozen political figures. In the run-up to municipal elections that year, Mr. Zuma described the Democratic Alliance, the A.N.C.\u2019s main rival, as a \u201cwhite party,\u201d adding that it could not \u201crun this country no matter how they cover up by getting a few black stooges.\u201d\n\nNew and radical groups like Black First Land First sprang up, holding public rallies to fulminate against whites. At one, in May 2016, a pastor named Xola Skosana told the crowd, \u201cWe have been wounded beyond measure. Let us find the pillars and bring the house down. Black people must be avenged.\u201d\n\nFor the first time in years, whites felt a rising sense of personal danger. Nicholas Wolpe, a white South African whose father was a pioneer of the anti-apartheid movement, remembers a palpable anxiety. \u201cThere was a shift toward intolerance,\u201d he said. \u201cGradually, the debate about white monopoly capital was everywhere and the people talking about it were loud and belligerent. It struck a nerve.\u201d\n\nIn a related and surreptitious campaign, the Guptas were being recast as warmhearted people eager to help the downtrodden. A website connected to Black First Land First ran editorials defending the brothers, suggesting in one that they should be \u201cpraised for saving jobs.\u201d\n\n", "keywords": ["met", "bell", "africa", "company", "reading", "end", "mr", "main", "despots", "firm", "campaign", "pottinger", "pr", "rogues", "south", "guptas"], "polarity": 0.05728090899659527, "subjectivity": 0.3829289628309236},

Just as Ms. Robinson and Ms. Gilmore led the 1955-56 boycott of buses in Alabama, in the 1970s, women like Louise Day Hicks led the antibusing crusades in the North, in an effort to avoid the desegregation of Boston public schools. While men debated in legislative chambers and listened to challenges on the bench, women headed to school cafeterias, playgrounds and PTA meetings, doing the bulk of the behind-the-scenes work of supporting the politics of segregation.\n\nWhite women organized precinct gatherings to pressure their politicians to uphold Jim Crow laws. They transformed their homes into centers of bureaucratic efficiency \u2014 copying fliers, assigning neighborhoods for petition drives and scheduling protest shifts at elementary schools and bus garages.\n\nIt was also women who shaped the way segregation, white supremacy and ideas about racial identity were knitted into the fabric of their communities. Working as midwives, teachers and social workers, women policed the racial identity of babies, students and clients to ensure that the dividing line between white and black remained intact. And across the nation, women-led groups like Patriotic American Youth and the Women for Constitutional Government and Pro America spread the message to the next generation that opposition to racial equality was about states\u2019 rights and limited government, not white supremacy.\n\nIf narratives about white supremacy have been shaped by the overwhelmingly masculine lens through which we examine practically all political movements, there are also aspects of white supremacy that make it different. One critical factor here is the central role ascribed to white male sexual and status anxiety and lust for dominance in fomenting organized white-supremacist activities. As part of arguments against desegregation, many who belonged to these movements embraced a narrative that saw white women and girls as vulnerable (to black men), and white men as protectors \u2014 a story line that simultaneously elevated white men and rendered women helpmates and beneficiaries, not activists.\n\nBut this broader narrative obscures and even gives cover to the ways white women sometimes used white supremacy for their own gain. The suffragist Carrie Chapman Catt in the early 20th century argued for women\u2019s voting rights in Southern states on the basis that \u201cwhite supremacy will be strengthened, not weakened, by white women\u2019s suffrage.\u201d In the 1920s, the journalist Nell Battle Lewis of North Carolina never questioned the absolute need for racial segregation even as she criticized the violence committed in the name of Jim Crow. Staying in the racial fold, she was afforded the opportunity to blast her state\u2019s regressive labor and gender politics. Being a white supremacist, even a liberal one, meant that she remained part of the conversation.\n\nThe point, here, is neither to catalog nor to celebrate white women\u2019s contributions to white supremacist politics. Instead, their work should change how we understand history. It is easy to denounce the racist pronouncements and white-supremacist politics of a George Wallace or a Roy Moore. But what white women teach us is that white-supremacist politics is sustained at a much more grass-roots level by our neighbors, school boards and even friends. White women have made white supremacy a much more formidable and long-lasting force in American society, sustaining it at both the local and national levels.\n\nToday, it seems, the story America prefers to tell itself about white supremacy has changed little since the middle of the century: Instead of Klan lynchings, we focus on the rally in Charlottesville; instead of George Wallace, we focus on Jeff Sessions or, for that matter, Donald Trump. Outrage over the violence and rhetoric of these men buries an equally important and certainly more intransigent story of longstanding grass-roots and national campaigns populated partly by white women who aim to maintain racial and economic inequities on the American landscape. If we begin to consider their staying power with seriousness rather than surprise \u2014 a surprise not shared by black women \u2014 perhaps we can more effectively prepare to counter this strand of American politics.", "keywords": ["racial", "american", "men", "white", "women", "womens", "politics", "supremacy", "whitesupremacist", "power", "work"], "polarity": 0.08455011423761423, "subjectivity": 0.23956078643578646},

The results reveal the challenges of integrating students across the system, and of integrating under one roof.\n\nThe study is a snapshot that looks at student performance on a single test, the state math assessment given in 2016 to third through fifth graders. At each school, it looks at the race of the test takers and estimates their household income using census information about where they live.\n\nThe report illustrates how closely race, income and academic performance are tied in this city. Almost all students in the study with estimated household incomes below $30,000 were black or Hispanic, while students with household incomes above $80,000 were predominantly white. And the poorer students were, the lower they tended to score on the test, even when they went to the same school as wealthier children.\n\nTake P.S. 8, the Robert Fulton school in Brooklyn Heights, which the Center for American Progress identified last year as having one of the richest Parent Teacher Associations in the country, and which has a relatively diverse student body. While 64 percent of its students passed the state math test in 2016, compared with 36 percent of students citywide, black students at the school were nearly a full proficiency level behind their white peers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBlack students at the school also had significantly lower estimated incomes than white students.\n\nNicole Mader, the co-author of the study, said the lingering achievement gap demonstrates that just having different kinds of students together in the same building is not enough to have true integration. Students must be in the same classrooms, have the same quality of teachers and be disciplined in the same way.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orban, and the right-wing government he leads, have been on the offensive since then over the European Union\u2019s migration policies, which require member states to resettle a quota of refugees. Last week, at a meeting in Budapest of the Visegrad Group, an alliance of central European nations, Mr. Orban said, \u201cWe do not wish to become a destination country for migrants.\u201d\n\nThe media here has offered widespread support to Mr. Okovacs for bringing back a popular production after decades. Origo, a government-friendly news website, published an article with the headline \u201cOnly blacks used to be able to perform this opera because of racist restrictions.\u201d And the online theater magazine szinhaz.hu welcomed what it referred to as the Hungarian State Opera\u2019s \u201cbreaking the ice\u201d by staging the opera with \u201cits excellent Hungarian singers.\u201d\n\nMany conservative columnists, including in the daily Magyar Nemzet, have denounced the \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d of performing the opera only with a black cast. \u201cPolitical correctness is slowly devouring aesthetics,\u201d one columnist said.\n\nThe director of the production, Andras Almasi-Toth, told szinhaz.huthat \u201cwhile performance and staging solutions have progressed \u2014 we play, sing and stage Puccini differently from 50 years ago \u2014 this opera was left out, which makes for a very sterile production. It can only take place on Catfish Row in the 1930s, which gives it a fairy-tale like quality, devoid of its real-life aspects.\u201d\n\nIn a telephone interview, Dr. Ronald Crutcher, an African-American music scholar and president of the University of Richmond, said that he thought the idea of transplanting \u201cPorgy and Bess\u201d to somewhere other than Catfish Row was \u201cfascinating\u201d but added that \u201cthe whole notion of recasting the story as an immigrant struggle is hard to imagine.

The message was seemingly a response to comments the hip-hop artist and businessman made during an interview with CNN on Saturday night.\n\nVan Jones, the CNN correspondent who conducted the interview with Jay-Z (here\u2019s a transcript), made his own statement on Twitter, pointing out that Jay-Z was acknowledging the low unemployment numbers.\n\nMr. Trump has referred to the unemployment rate at least three other times recently on his Twitter account. He also cited it during his speech at the World Economic Summit in Davos, Switzerland, on Friday.\n\nMr. Trump is right. Black unemployment in the United States reached its lowest level in December. But, as my colleague Linda Qiu reported two weeks ago, the record is the culmination of a longer trend, and there has been no shift in the larger racial unemployment gap:\n\nThe 6.8 percent unemployment rate for black Americans in December is indeed the lowest since 1972, according to the latest monthly data that is available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But the rate has been in decline for several years, decreasing steadily from 16.4 percent in August 2011 to 7.8 percent in January 2017. The December figures also do not reflect a significantly different racial unemployment gap. The black unemployment rate has consistently been double that of the white unemployment rate, and remained at that level in December. Presidents, especially in their first year, generally do not single-handedly influence the labor markets \u2014 as Mr. Trump suggests.\n\nFurther, it\u2019s an open question whether a president can claim credit for economic outputs like unemployment. As my colleague Neil Irwin has explained:\n\nSo does Mr. Trump deserve any credit for solid economic results? If you think the economy is driven by concrete, specific policies around taxes, spending, monetary policy and regulation, the answer is no.

Trump\u2019s religious champions, Michael Gerson writes in The Washington Post, are \u201cassociating evangelicalism with bigotry, selfishness and deception. They are playing a grubby political game for the highest of stakes: the reputation of their faith.\u201d\n\nI sympathize with his distress. But the politicized sectors of conservative evangelicalism have been associated with bigotry, selfishness and deception for a long time. Trump has simply revealed the movement\u2019s priorities. It values the preservation of traditional racial and sexual hierarchies over fuzzier notions of wholesomeness.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve resisted throughout my career the notion that evangelicals are racist, I really have,\u201d Balmer told me. \u201cBut I think the 2016 election demonstrated that the religious right was circling back to the founding principles of the movement. What happened in 2016 is that the religious right dropped all pretense that theirs was a movement about family values.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThis is one reason I find it hard to take seriously religious conservatives who say they are being persecuted for their defense of traditional marriage. People who are sympathetic to Christian, conservative Trump supporters \u2014 even if they don\u2019t support Trump themselves \u2014 will say that they\u2019ve been backed into a corner by the expansion of civil rights laws and policies protecting gay people. As they see it, liberals not only won the culture war on gay marriage but now are also demanding that private redoubts of resistance be brought into line.\n\nReferring to the Supreme Court\u2019s 2015 gay-marriage decision, Rod Dreher, a social-conservative Trump critic, wrote, \u201cPost-Obergefell, Christians who hold to the biblical teaching about sex and marriage have the same status in culture, and increasingly in law, as racists.\u201d\n\nDreher obviously thinks they deserve much better. He sees a fundamental difference between Christians who thought their religious freedom was trampled by desegregation and Christians who think their religious freedom is trampled when their business and charities have to serve gay people.\n\nBut it seems absurd to ask secular people to respect the religious right\u2019s beliefs about sex and marriage \u2014 and thus tolerate a degree of anti-gay discrimination \u2014 while the movement\u2019s leaders treat their own sexual standards as flexible and conditional.

In 1974, her biography \u201cThomas Jefferson: An Intimate History\u201d contended that the third president had fathered children with his slave Sally Hemings. For this, Catherine Kerrison, a professor of American history at Villanova University, accurately notes, Brodie was \u201cexcoriated by a cadre of Jefferson experts.\u201d A lot has changed, and largely because of the work of Annette Gordon-Reed, who took seriously Hemings family stories and, bolstered by a DNA study, convinced nearly all scholars, including Kerrison, that Brodie was correct. \u201cJefferson\u2019s Daughters,\u201d Kerrison\u2019s beautifully written book, takes the relationship\u2019s existence as a given.\n\nAnd so, to a nuanced study of Jefferson\u2019s two white daughters, Martha (born 1772) and Maria (born 1778), she innovatively adds a discussion of his only enslaved daughter, Harriet Hemings (born 1801). The result is a stunning if unavoidably imbalanced book, combining detailed treatments of Martha\u2019s and Maria\u2019s experiences with imaginative attempts to reconstruct Harriet\u2019s life.\n\nKerrison first examines the ill-fated marriage of Thomas Jefferson and the young widow Martha Wayles Skelton. Not ill-fated because of a lack of love or resources, but because of Martha\u2019s repeated problems with childbirth, which caused her death in 1782. Alone of all their children, the two daughters survived into adulthood. Kerrison\u2019s account of the girls\u2019 residence with their father in Paris in the 1780s includes vivid descriptions of the streetscape and architecture they encountered, as well as of the impact of their divergent educational experiences. While the vivacious Martha had five years of rigorous convent education, her sister Maria had less than two. As a result, the older girl, Kerrison contends, later stressed the importance of educating the daughters born to her and her husband, Thomas Mann Randolph, whereas Maria was content to be a conventional wife of the planter Jack Eppes.\n\nThe lives of four Virginia families \u2014 Jeffersons, Randolphs, Eppeses and Hemingses \u2014 were intertwined. Sally Hemings, daughter of Jefferson\u2019s father-in-law by his mulatto slave Elizabeth Hemings, arrived in the Jefferson household in Paris in 1787 at the age of 14 assigned to be the child Maria\u2019s companion. Following Hemings\u2019s oral history, Kerrison relates how Sally, knowing she could claim freedom by remaining in France when Jefferson returned home in 1789, negotiated a promise of eventual freedom for herself and all her children, who were by parentage seven-eighths white \u2014 a promise kept in part by Martha Randolph after her father\u2019s death in 1826. Jefferson listed Beverley, the oldest boy, born 1798, and his younger sister, Harriet, as \u201crun\u201d in 1822, but other sources reveal that he quietly facilitated their departure.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe book\u2019s most innovative chapters attempt to reconstruct, from scattered fragments, Harriet\u2019s life in slavery and freedom. At Monticello, she and her mother \u2014 along with the Randolph family \u2014 lived as adjuncts to the plantation\u2019s master. The house was designed solely for Jefferson\u2019s comfort; Kerrison comments that \u201cfamily life, however, was architecturally all but invisible\u201d there; the master\u2019s white and black dependents lived and worked in small, inconvenient or upstairs rooms. By age 14, Harriet was put to work on a spinning jenny, suggesting to Kerrison that Jefferson might have thought he was training her adequately \u201cfor her future role as a housewife in a working-class household.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Kerrison identified 58 \u201cHarriets\u201d who wed in Washington between 1822 and 1830. She takes readers along on her research journey through disparate records, but ultimately concludes that Harriet Hemings \u201cwill keep her secret.\u201d\n\nThe last chapter, \u201cLegacies,\u201d ruminates on the fate of each of the women from a contemporary perspective. Maria, who like her mother died young from childbirth, leads Kerrison to point out that current attacks on women\u2019s reproductive health threaten \u201cto return women to the conditions endured by their 19th-century forebears,\u201d making Maria\u2019s fate \u201cboth timely and crucial.\u201d Martha and her daughters prompt Kerrison\u2019s musings on women\u2019s education, for \u201cin spite of all their scholarly attainments, they remained, after all, women,\u201d with no obvious way to use their learning in their own day.

His tactics in Birmingham were geared toward maximum media impact. Marches were scheduled to accommodate the evening news \u2014 and when recruits were scarce, Mr. Walker counted on spectators to inflate the white newsmen\u2019s troop count. (\u201cMarchers, spectators?\u201d Mr. Walker said. \u201cTo them we all looked alike.\u201d) He finessed a call from President Kennedy to Coretta Scott King when her husband was jailed, and came up with the idea for King to write his jailhouse epistle. His efforts to get \u201cLetter from Birmingham Jail\u201d published didn\u2019t bear fruit until the campaign succeeded.\n\nMost important, Mr. Walker had known from the start that mass moral witnesses, such as the nonviolent marches led by praying ministers, would not be enough to turn public opinion against segregation and get the desired federal intervention. He would need the segregationists to act out visually the violence and evil at the system\u2019s core. When Mr. Connor briefly deployed the German Shepherds in early April, Mr. Walker exulted, \u201cWe\u2019ve got a movement. We had some police brutality. They brought out the dogs.\u201d Within a month, he got his picture, and King the credit for bringing down American apartheid.\n\nThirty-six years later in New York, March 1999, I was struck by echoes of Birmingham in the protests against Mayor Rudolph Giuliani over the unpunished police shooting of an unarmed African immigrant, Amadou Diallo. A photograph of one of the protesters \u2014 Mr. Giuliani\u2019s predecessor David Dinkins, New York\u2019s first and so far only black mayor \u2014 who was cuffed along with Representative Charles Rangel, reminded me especially of a picture of King and his deputy Ralph Abernathy being arrested in Birmingham on Good Friday, 1963. It didn\u2019t surprise me to discover Mr. Walker\u2019s fingerprints all over these electrifying demonstrations. He was at the time on the board of the Rev. Al Sharpton\u2019s National Action Network, which organized the protests.\n\nTwo years later, when my book on Birmingham came out, I brought a magazine photographer to Mr. Walker\u2019s church to take our picture. He fixed me with his perfectionist glare and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what it is about you journalists that makes you think Dr. King was so namby-pamby.\u201d\n\nThe last time I saw Mr. Walker was nine years ago, at a King holiday event in Dallas. He had retired from Harlem\u2019s Canaan Baptist and moved to Virginia in the aftermath of strokes that left him dependent on a wheelchair and incapable of much facial expression, though his eyes still radiated trouble and his mouth still delivered the gibes.\n\nWe clutched hands in front of a TV, watching the inauguration of Barack Obama as the 44th president of the United States.

{"title": "\n                    Wyatt Tee Walker, Dr. King\u2019s Strategist and a Harlem Leader, Dies at 88                ", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/23/obituaries/wyatt-tee-walker-dead.html", "text": "The two had been presidents of their classes \u2014 Dr. King at Crozer Theological Seminary in Pennsylvania \u2014 and they had their first encounter during an inter-seminary meeting.\n\nDr. Walker joined the fledgling Southern Christian Leadership Conference in 1961 and served until 1964 as its executive director and, unofficially, as Dr. King\u2019s right-hand man. At the S.C.L.C., he devised a structured fund-raising strategy and organized numerous protests, including a series of anti-segregation boycotts and demonstrations in Birmingham, Ala., that came to be known as Project C.\n\nThe C stood for \u201cconfrontation,\u201d and the project is regarded as the blueprint for the civil rights movement\u2019s success in the South.\n\n\u201cThe federal government was against us, the local communities were against us, the judges were against us, but we managed to do it, and I guess we found the strength to do it because it was a moral fight,\u201d Dr. Walker said in an interview for this obituary in 2006.\n\n\u201cI was fully committed to nonviolence, and I believe with all my heart that for the civil rights movement to prove itself, its nonviolent actions had to work in Birmingham,\u201d he continued. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for Birmingham, there wouldn\u2019t have been a Selma march, there wouldn\u2019t have been a 1965 civil rights bill. Birmingham was the birthplace and affirmation of the nonviolent movement in America.\u201d\n\nDr. Walker helped circulate \u201cLetter From Birmingham Jail,\u201d one of the most important documents of the civil rights movement, in which Dr. King argued for civil disobedience as a legitimate response to racial segregation. He also helped organize the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, which culminated with Dr. King\u2019s \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech.\n\nPhoto\n\nScholars and activists alike say his management skills were crucial in turning the S.C.L.C. from a largely volunteer organization into a national power in the civil rights movement, with a million-dollar budget and 100 full-time workers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA March 1964 report by the Alabama Legislative Commission to Preserve the Peace, which investigated civil rights-era militants, subversives and communists, described Dr. Walker as \u201cthe real leader of the Negro movement.\u201d\n\nThe Rev. Jesse L. Jackson said Dr. Walker\u2019s \u201cbrilliance as a strategist was his greatest contribution to the civil rights movement.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe comes from a time when civil rights leaders were martyrs, and not marketers,\u201d Mr. Jackson added. \u201cAnd he knew how to harness the energies of people who were excited about social change, and how to use the church as the center of his advocacy for the poor, the marginalized and the oppressed.\u201d\n\nWyatt Tee Walker, a grandson of a former slave, was born on Aug. 16, 1929, in the shoemaking town of Brockton, Mass., the 10th of 11 children of the Rev. John Wise Walker and the former Maude Pinn. His father had been a member of the first graduating class of Virginia Union University in 1899 and read both Greek and Hebrew. His mother was also a Union graduate, and books filled the family home.\n\nWhen Wyatt was a child the family moved to southern New Jersey, where his father had obtained a post preaching at a small black church in Merchantville. The heavyweight champion Jersey Joe Walcott, who had grown up there, was a family friend.\n\nBut the pulpit produced little income; the family was impoverished during the Depression, Mr. Walker told a biographer for a dissertation; he used cardboard to cover holes in the soles of his shoes. Five siblings died of childhood diseases before he was old enough to remember them, he said.\n\nAfter graduating from high school in Merchantville in 1946, he went south to Virginia Union, carrying $100 that his parents had given him as tuition money to cover the first two semesters. He went on to earn a bachelor\u2019s degree in both physics and chemistry in 1950, graduating with high honors.\n\nPhoto\n\nHe received his master of divinity degree from Union three years later. He also held a doctorate from Colgate Rochester Crozer Divinity School in Rochester. (The Crozer seminary in Pennsylvania had merged with Colgate Rochester in 1970.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAn authority on gospel music and a composer of religious music as well, Dr. Walker published several books and articles that dealt with the relationship among music, black religious tradition and social change. His photography was also the subject of exhibits.\n\nOrdained in 1952, he preached for seven years at the Gillfield Baptist Church in Petersburg, Va. He staged numerous acts of civil disobedience during this time, resulting in 17 arrests. The first one came after he led a group of black men and women through the \u201cwhites only\u201d door of the local library.\n\nIn Petersburg, he served as president of the local branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, state director of the Congress of Racial Equality and founder of the Petersburg Improvement Association, modeled on the Montgomery Improvement Association, which guided the bus boycott in Montgomery, Ala.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

He then moved to Virginia to be closer to relatives.\n\nDr. Walker married Theresa Edwards on Dec. 24, 1950. She survives him, as do a daughter, Patrice Walker Powell; three sons, Robert, Earl and Wyatt Jr.; a sister, Mary Holley; and two granddaughters.\n\nDuring his long tenure at Canaan Baptist, in the heart of Harlem at 116th Street between Adam Clayton Powell Boulevard and Lenox Avenue, Dr. Walker oversaw extensive development of church-sponsored affordable housing, housing for the elderly and what the church calls the oldest senior services center in Harlem.\n\nIn 1999, he was instrumental in establishing Harlem\u2019s first charter school, the Sisulu-Walker Charter School (named for Dr. Walker and the South African anti-apartheid leader Walter Sisulu). He was a strong advocate of providing parents with taxpayer-financed vouchers for private schools, a position that put him at odds with champions of public schools in Harlem.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn addition to the National Action Network, Dr. Walker had been chairman of the Freedom National Bank, which sought to fill Harlem\u2019s economic needs in the absence of major banks for a quarter-century, until it collapsed in 1990 under the weight of risky loans, and the Consortium for Central Harlem Development, which the church says was responsible for $100 million in housing.\n\nFor Dr. Walker, the civil rights movement had not ended with legislative victories in the 1960s. In 1989, speaking from the pulpit of Riverside Church in Manhattan to celebrate Dr. King\u2019s 60th birthday, he said that the establishment of a national holiday to honor King had \u201cseduced us into becoming too comfortable.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cIt is insufficient for us to come together on his birthday, sometimes in an artificial way, white and black together, and sing \u2018We Shall Overcome\u2019 and hold hands and get a warm feeling and then go back to business as usual in white racist America.\u201d\n\nDr. Walker was long on the front lines in the fight against drug trafficking and addiction in Harlem, recruiting other churches and community groups to help in that effort.\n\n\u201cWe wanted our children to have a choice that was better than drugs,\u201d he told The Times in 2015, adding, \u201cYou couldn\u2019t buy aspirin\u201d in the neighborhoods, \u201cbut you could buy any kind of drug.\u201d The police, he said, were \u201coverwhelmed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe just felt they weren\u2019t doing anything about it.\u201d\n\nAt one point the Harlem drug kingpin Frank Lucas \u201cput a hit out on me,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause I was effectively thwarting the drug traffic.\u201d But he said he had shrugged off the threats.\n\n\u201cThey were always warning me that it was dangerous, but that didn\u2019t stop me,\u201d he said. \u201cI had been involved in the struggle in the Deep South, so I was accustomed to dangerous situations. It was tough to frighten me, because I was so convinced that God would take care of me.\u201d", "keywords": ["wyatt", "88", "tee", "leader", "rights", "kings", "national", "dies", "civil", "walker", "church", "union", "harlem", "birmingham", "movement", "dr", "strategist"], "polarity": 0.08066487043049546, "subjectivity": 0.3728109217171716}
